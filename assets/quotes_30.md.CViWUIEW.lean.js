It may be held at any stage of education, from primary to tertiary, even though it is typically held at tertiary stage.  By country  = France = France is the country that surely uses the most competitive examinations. Some education professionals tend to say that the \\"Concours G√©n√©ral\\" (not mandatory, as the Baccalaur√©at is) in the last year of High School (Lyc√©e) is the most difficult to take worldwide with only 250 places in all subjects for 15,000 applicants (there is a failure rate of 98,3%). There are also an entrance competitive examination in order to enter medicine studies: (1 preparation year, 10 mandatory years after competitive exam, failure rate of 85%); \\"grandes √©coles\\" of engineering (2 preparation years, 4 mandatory years after competitive exam, failure rate of approx. 50%), and \\"grandes √©coles\\" of business (2 preparation years, 3 mandatory years after competitive exam, failure rate of approx. 25%). In France, the fact of having succeeded in one competitive exam is highly recognized by the society, and shows you are part of the national elite. = India = :For different systems of syllabi, testing and grading refer to the different systems of Indian Education and Grading In India, entrance examinations are chiefly confined to medicine, engineering, and management. These range from the BITS Pilani admission test and IIT-JEE where only one in a hundreds can hope to get admission to state level entrances which are many and varied. The stiff competition has led to a situation where many students neglect their school studies and focus solely on 'entrance coaching' which is time-consuming and expensive. This has led many states to scrap the entrances and base admissions on the school leaving marks which, unfortunately are none too reliable. Experts point out that in a country where many different boards are present common entrances are essential, but application skills rather than cramming should be stressed on. Frequent changes in the pattern of examination are essential since sticking to a 'standard text' or 'standard pattern' alone will favour the coaching industry and the rote-learners. Entrance Examinations in India trace their roots to the University of Calcutta, which when established in 1857, introduced the practice to decide eligibility for admission. In that exam, one student was passed in every four candidates. From Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka only 219 students were qualified. Only 162 were passed from the Bangladesh, Pakistan, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Madhaya Pradesh. In the absence of a standardized school graduation examination, the University's entrance examinations were used as a substitute, known later as Matriculation examinations. Post-independence India has different systems of education whose syllabus and examination process are governed by both central and state-based statutory boards. Grades 10 and 12 which mark the culmination of secondary and higher secondary education, have standardized final examinations, referred to as the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination after grade 10 (class X) and the Higher Secondary Examination(HSC) after grade 12th. = United Kingdom = One-half of British universities have lost confidence in the grades that are awarded by secondary schools, and require many applicants to sit for a competitive entrance examination or other aptitude test. According to the Schools Minister, ‚Äústrong evidence has been emerging of grade inflation across subjects‚Äù in recent years.  COVID-19 Impact  Due to coronavirus presence in many countries which embraced school closures either on state or national scale, some entrance examinations for high schools were eventually cancelled to reduce the stress of students and the possibility of coronavirus infection impact during the attendance.

Bennett and Flach (2011) have drawn a contrast between dyadic and triadic approaches to the semiotics of display design. The classical 'user-centered' approach is based on a dyadic semiotic model where the focus is on the human- interface dyad. This approach frames 'meaning' as a process of interpreting the symbolic representation. That is, meaning is constructed from internal information processes. From this dyadic perspective, the design goal is to build interfaces that 'match' the users internal model (i.e., match user expectations). In contrast, the 'use-centered' approach is based on a triadic semiotic model that includes the work domain (or ecology) as a third component of the semiotic system. In the triadic system, the work domain provides a ground for meaning outside of the human information processing system. In this, triadic semiotic system, the focus is on the match between the constraints in the work domain and the mental representations. From this 'use- centered' approach the goal is to design displays that 'shape' the internal mental representations so that they reflect validated models of the work domain. In other words, the goal is to shape user expectations to conform with the validated 'deep structure' of the work domain. In doing this, work analysis (e.g., Vicente, 1999) and multi-level means ends representations of work domain constraints (i.e., Rasmussen's Abstraction Hierarchy) are the typical methods used to specify the 'deep structure' of a work domain. By building configural display representations that conform to this deep structure -- it is possible to facilitate skilled interactions between the human and the work domain. Thus, an emphasis on 'use' rather than 'user' suggests a more problem-centered focus for interface design. Note that it remains important to respect the real limitations of human information processing systems through the use of graphical displays that support efficient chunking of information. However, the main point is that the organization MUST be consistent with the demands of the work or problem domain, if the interactions that result are expected to be skillful. In the end, the representations must be 'grounded' in the use-domain! C.S. Peirce is the inspiration for the triadic model of semiotics. Peirce was interested in the fixation of belief relative to pragmatic demands of everyday experiences. Peirce also introduced the construct of 'abduction' as an alternative to classical logic (deduction and induction). The 'use-centered' approach assumes abduction as the appropriate model for problem solving. Thus, use-centered design focuses on supporting the closed-loop dynamic of learning from experience. That is, by acting on hypotheses and simultaneously testing those hypotheses in terms of the practical consequences of the actions that they guide. The convergence, stability, and robustness of abduction processes depend critically on the information coupling between perception and action. When the coupling is rich an abduction system will typically converge on 'beliefs' that lead to pragmatically successful (i.e., satisfying) interactions (i.e., skilled interactions). This is the ultimate goal of use- centered design - to support skilled interactions between a person and a work domain. Use-centered design was first coined by John Flach and Cynthia Dominguez (Flach, J. M. & Dominguez, C. O. (1995). Use-centered design: Integrating the user, instrument, and goal.

For instance, here are some characteristics commonly associated with God: :One ‚Äî Many :Transcendent ‚Äî Immanent :Eternal ‚Äî Temporal :Mutable ‚Äî Immutable :Merciful ‚Äî Just :Simple ‚Äî Complex Dipolar theism holds that in each pair, both of the characteristics contain some element of good. To embody all perfections, therefore, God must embody the good in both characteristics, and cannot be limited to one, because a God limited to one would suffer the limits of the one, and lack the good in the other. For instance, there is a \\"good\\" in being just, and also a good in being merciful. In being just, God determines that the good are rewarded and the evil are punished. In being merciful, God forgives those who sin. It follows, therefore, that a God that was only just or only merciful would be less than perfect. Dipolar theism holds that a perfect God must embody the good in both of those characteristics. Thus, a perfect God has the \\"good\\" characteristics of justice and the good characteristics of mercy. Alternatively, there is good in having absolute power, and good in leading by persuasion. For a God to be perfect, he cannot rule solely by predestination, because then he would lack the good possessed by a God who led by persuasion. God must therefore embody the \\"good\\" in both power and persuasion. From this conclusion, some reject the existence of an omnipotent God. Critique of dipolar theism Those rejecting dipolar theism argue that it fails to distinguish between what we think God is and what God actually is. Just because we think God should be a certain way to embody our idea of perfection does not mean God embodies those characteristics in reality. This critique is analogous to the critique of Anselm's ontological argument by Gaunilo: \\"Just because I can imagine a perfect island does not mean that it actually exists. Things are what they are no matter what I think they should be.\\" Philosophy of religion Theism Process theology ","title":"Dipolar theism"},{"id":"1795043","text":"Jacob Axelsson Lindblom (27 July 1746 - 15 February 1819) was a Swedish scholar and professor who became Archbishop of Uppsala, a position he held between 1805-1819. Biography Axelsson Lindblom was born at Skeda in √ñsterg√∂tland, the son of a clergyman. He received his secondary education at Link√∂ping gymnasium and matriculated at Uppsala University in 1763. He became student of the philologist Johan Ihre and the Latinist Petrus Ekerman (1696‚Äì 1783) who was also inspector of the student society √ñstg√∂ta nation (Uppsala). He worked as a tutor for a noble family in Livonia 1764-1766, came back to Uppsala where he completed his magister degree in 1770. After having worked as a docent and a librarian at the university library, he became an extraordinary professor in 1779 and was appointed to the Skyttean professorship of Eloquence and Political Science in 1781, after the death of his teacher Johan Ihre. Axelsson Lindblom published a History of Roman Literature (Illustriores lingu√¶ Roman√¶ critici) and collaborated with Ihre on a Lexicon Latino-Svecanum, which he was eventually to complete in 1790. He published prolifically historical, literary and other topics, but is not regarded as particularly original in his scholarly production. Axelsson Lindblom was a favorite of King Gustavus III, who made him Bishop of Link√∂ping in December 1786, nor withstanding the fact he had never been ordained, a situation remedied a few days after the appointment. As bishop he succeeded Uno von Troil, who had been made Archbishop of Uppsala, and in 1805 he succeeded von Troil as archbishop of Uppsala as well, an appointment which also made him Pro-Chancellor of the University. He was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1809, and was awarded a knighthood in the Order of Seraphim in 1818. His children were raised to the nobility with a change of surname to Lindersk√∂ld.

He played with Manchester United, Celtic and Bristol Rovers, among others. He represented his country at under 21 level. Playing career Martin started his career in the Manchester United youth system. In 1990, he scored the only goal in the FA Cup final replay against Crystal Palace. This was one of just two goals Martin scored in his entire United career. The other goal, his first, came 16 months earlier in the 3‚Äì1 defeat of West Ham at Upton Park. His debut came on 9 May 1988 as a substitute in a 2‚Äì1 home league win over Wimbledon and he made his breakthrough at left back the following season following the departure of Arthur Albiston. By the time of his first United goal, in a 3‚Äì1 win at West Ham United in the league of 21 January 1989, he was a regular feature in the United squad. He played in 32 out of 38 league games in the cup winning 1989‚Äì90 campaign, but managed just 14 league games the following season as Clayton Blackmore established himself as United's regular left-back, with Denis Irwin joining as a right-back, and Martin struggled against a back injury. He did not make the squad for the side that won the European Cup Winners Cup a year later, although he did play in multiple games en route to the final. The arrival of Paul Parker that summer increased the competition for full-back places. He managed just one league appearance in 1991‚Äì92 and did not make the squad for the Football League Cup winning team. However, he did collect a European Super Cup winner's medal on 19 November 1991 when he featured in their 1‚Äì0 triumph over Red Star Belgrade at Old Trafford, though he was substituted in the 71st minute in favour of Ryan Giggs. He failed to make a single league appearance in 1992‚Äì93 season, when they won the first FA Premier League title. His final league appearance came on 23 October 1993 in a 1‚Äì0 Premier League win over Everton at Goodison Park, as United were on course for retaining the league title. They also went on to win the FA Cup that season. 1993‚Äì94 saw the introduction of squad numbers in the Premier League, and Martin made one appearance in the number 21 shirt. His final competitive appearance for the club was on 27 October 1993 in a 5‚Äì1 home win over Leicester City in the third round of the League Cup. Towards the end of his time at Manchester United, Martin regularly captained the reserve side. Martin played a total of 108 games and scored two goals for United before he left Old Trafford in January 1994 to join Celtic, where he suffered a broken leg within months of his arrival. He played just 19 times in the league in more than two years as Celtic failed to overhaul Rangers, who were league champions of Scotland in each of three seasons that Martin spent north of the border. Celtic's only major honour during Martin's time there was the Scottish FA Cup in 1995, but he didn't make the squad for that game. He finally left Celtic in 1996 and signed for Bristol Rovers, from where he later had a loan spell with Huddersfield Town. He retired from professional football in 1998. He then moved to the semi-professional League of Wales team Bangor City, Glossop North End and then to NEWI Cefn Druids in 2006. Martin retired from football in 2008, and currently works with young people helping them to gain qualifications, access college and get apprenticeships or employment in the West Cheshire area. He also helps with the coaching of the Chester FC under 16's youth team. He also works for Manchester United Television at Old Trafford.

CoolStreaming creates a local stream on localhost and that stream is then read by Windows Media Player, RealPlayer or other media players. The original coolstreaming code is developed with Python 2.3 on Windows. Coolstreaming is a data-centric design of peer-to-peer streaming overlay. Notable features of the protocol include its intelligent scheduling algorithm that copes well with the bandwidth differences of uploading clients and thus minimises skipping during playback, and its swarm-style architecture that uses a directed graph based on gossip algorithms to broadcast content availability. Coolstreaming is the first P2PTV system that attracted a remarkable number of clients (over one million, while most of the previous systems attracted less than one thousand clients). As of June 10, 2005 the Coolstreaming service had stopped due to copyright issues. However, there are several alternative services. CoolStreaming is the base technology for Roxbeam Corp., which launched live IPTV programs jointly with Yahoo Japan in October 2006.

The school consists of an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school, all located on the Ch≈çfu campus. There is also an early learning center (nursery-kindergarten) for children aged 3‚Äì5 located in the Roppongi Hills complex in downtown Tokyo. Instruction is in English and follows an American-style curriculum. About two thirds of the school's students are the children of citizens of a wide variety of countries who are on temporary assignment in Japan, and the remaining one third are Japanese students who speak English. The campus is fenced in, resulting from heightened security measures taken after the September 11 attacks, with campus surroundings including the Nogawa Park and the neighborhood of Tama. The Good Schools Guide International called ASIJ \\"an impressive school, not only for its size and facilities but also for its strong sense of where it is going.\\" History Officially founded in 1902, The American School in Japan was started by a group of women who recognized the need for a school among the growing foreign community. Beginning life in rented rooms in the Kanda YMCA, the Tokyo School for Foreign Children, as it was then known, quickly attracted a growing numbers of students from around the world and soon needed to move to a more permanent home in Tsukiji. In 1921, the school moved to a new 3 story building in Shibaura. The building was deemed unsafe after the Great Kanto earthquake, and classes resumed on the Friends Mission compound in Shiba, in the former home of the Bowles family. In the early 1920s Frank Lloyd Wright, who was in Tokyo building the Imperial Hotel, drew designs for a proposed new campus, as did Antonin Raymond. Although neither of the designs were constructed, Raymond assisted in the move and repurposing of some buildings when the school moved to Nakameguro in 1927. In 1933, local expatriate architect William Merrell Vories was asked to design and build a new main concrete building for the campus, which was completed in 1934. After closing during the war years, the school reopened in 1946. The current campus in Chofu was opened in 1963. A series of major improvements to the main campus began in the late 1990s, with seismic updates, a new elementary school gym, and an expansion to the high school which included a redesigned entrance. A new cafeteria building with classrooms and administrative offices on the second and third floors opened in 2003. In 2004, the school's Early Learning Center opened in Roppongi Hills, moving from Nakameguro. A new theater complex opened in 2005. Between 2006 and 2009, athletic fields and playgrounds were upgraded and solar panels were installed. Between 2010 and 2013, a series of changes designed by Paul Tange addressed campus traffic flow, added new athletic facilities (including raised tennis courts with covered bus drop-off below, and replaced the Multipurpose Room, along with the Elementary music and art classrooms with the CADC (Creative Art Design Center) which not only houses the music and art classrooms, but also houses multiple rooms for the high school and middle school Design Technology classes, a Japanese Culture center, and holds multiple meeting rooms. = Jack Moyer sexual abuse= In March 2014, the school publicly announced that a teacher, Jack Moyer, had sexually abused students during his tenure from 1963~1988. He also continued to be involved in the school's 7th grade Miyake outdoor program until 2002, when the erupting island volcano ended that locale for the program. The school stated that the current administration and board had found out about this abuse in November 2013. However, victims of Moyer allege that past administrators were informed as far back as 1968. The school says that it has no record of this earlier reporting. Moyer committed suicide in 2004. Alumni called on the school to commission an independent investigation into a possible years-long cover-up by the school's administration over the abuse allegations. Mitchell, Jon, \\"After ASIJ admission that teacher abused kids, ex-students demand inquiry\\", Japan Times, 13 May 2014, p. 10 The school announced on 4 June 2014 that it had contracted the law firm Ropes & Gray to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations against Moyer and how ASIJ responded to the allegations.Mitchell, Jon, \\"ASIJ announces investigation into sex abuse\\", Japan Times, 10 June 2014, p. 10 In June, 2015, the ASIJ Board of Directors released a letter admitting that an independent investigation found that Jack Moyer's abuse of students was extensive and that the abuse was covered up by faculty and administrators for years. The board apologized for the harm this has caused and promised to release the report in English and Japanese by mid-June, 2015. The full report, released by Ropes & Gray LLP on June 15, 2015, concluded \\"[i]n light of all of the evidence we have examined, it is apparent to us that Moyer was a serial pedophile who, in our assessment, sexually abused female ASIJ students\\". Lawyers for 13 of the victims also released their report on June 15, 2015. Curriculum ASIJ follows a broadly American curriculum and 17 Advanced Placement courses are offered for high school juniors and seniors. There is a Japanese language program, which begins in the first grade. Other languages taught are Spanish and Chinese. All the students in the Elementary School must learn Japanese for one period every other day. There are 50 different levels in the Japanese classes. The Early Learning Center's philosophy is heavily influenced by the Reggio Emilia Approach and the curriculum is project based. The elementary school uses the Columbia Writing Program and Everyday Math program in addition to curriculum units developed by faculty. In 2012, ASIJ joined Global Online Academy, a consortium of leading independent schools that offers courses taught by consortium member teachers to member school students. GOA courses are designed to give students an opportunity to offer their local perspective to global issues. Environmental sustainability SAFE, Student Action for the Environment, has been recycling paper for over a decade, approximately 20 tons last year. The school started keeping baseline data on energy usage and garbage volumes in 2007 when they began composting cafeteria waste and campus leaves using earthworms. The compost is used to fertilize the gardens and greenery around campus. Used cooking oil is donated to Revo International to produce biodiesel fuel. Reflective paint on building roofs, reflective film on windows, the installation of more double pane windows and LED lighting were largely accomplished in 2008. In 2009, with the help of government funding and private and corporate donors, the school installed solar panels on top of the gym and pool buildings which have a maximum capacity of 80 kW/h. ASIJ also promotes energy conservation each year by not turning on the heat or air-conditioning during October and April, aka NO HEAT- NO COOL months, and has reduced PET bottle consumption by promoting the use of water bottles such as SIGG and replaced regular PET bottles in vending machines with Coca-Cola's I Lohas bottles. Since the 2007-2008 school year, ASIJ has reduced annual energy consumption on campus by 25.1% with a goal of 30% by the end of 2013. A 2010-2011 carbon footprint audit by ECO3 Design has given the school new goals to replace heavy-oil boilers and install a ground source heat exchange system.

The resulting plot can then be used to pick off the response of any linear system, given its natural frequency of oscillation. One such use is in assessing the peak response of buildings to earthquakes. The science of strong ground motion may use some values from the ground response spectrum (calculated from recordings of surface ground motion from seismographs) for correlation with seismic damage. If the input used in calculating a response spectrum is steady-state periodic, then the steady- state result is recorded. Damping must be present, or else the response will be infinite. For transient input (such as seismic ground motion), the peak response is reported. Some level of damping is generally assumed, but a value will be obtained even with no damping. Response spectra can also be used in assessing the response of linear systems with multiple modes of oscillation (multi-degree of freedom systems), although they are only accurate for low levels of damping. Modal analysis is performed to identify the modes, and the response in that mode can be picked from the response spectrum. These peak responses are then combined to estimate a total response. A typical combination method is the square root of the sum of the squares (SRSS) if the modal frequencies are not close. The result is typically different from that which would be calculated directly from an input, since phase information is lost in the process of generating the response spectrum. The main limitation of response spectra is that they are only universally applicable for linear systems. Response spectra can be generated for non-linear systems, but are only applicable to systems with the same non-linearity, although attempts have been made to develop non-linear seismic design spectra with wider structural application. The results of this cannot be directly combined for multi-mode response.  Seismic response spectra  Response spectra are very useful tools of earthquake engineering for analyzing the performance of structures and equipment in earthquakes, since many behave principally as simple oscillators (also known as single degree of freedom systems). Thus, if you can find out the natural frequency of the structure, then the peak response of the building can be estimated by reading the value from the ground response spectrum for the appropriate frequency. In most building codes in seismic regions, this value forms the basis for calculating the forces that a structure must be designed to resist (seismic analysis). As mentioned earlier, the ground response spectrum is the response plot done at the free surface of the earth. Significant seismic damage may occur if the building response is 'in tune' with components of the ground motion (resonance), which may be identified from the response spectrum. This was observed in the 1985 Mexico City Earthquake where the oscillation of the deep-soil lake bed was similar to the natural frequency of mid-rise concrete buildings, causing significant damage. Shorter (stiffer) and taller (more flexible) buildings suffered less damage. In 1941 at Caltech, George W. Housner began to publish calculations of response spectra from accelerographs. In the 1982 EERI Monograph on \\"Earthquake Design and Spectra\\", Newmark and Hall describe how they developed an \\"idealized\\" seismic response spectrum based on a range of response spectra generated for available earthquake records. This was then further developed into a design response spectrum for use in structural design, and this basic form (with some modifications) is now the basis for structural design in seismic regions throughout the world (typically plotted against structural \\"period\\", the inverse of frequency). A nominal level of damping is assumed (5% of critical damping). For \\"regular\\" low-rise buildings, the structural response to earthquakes is characterized by the fundamental mode (a \\"waving\\" back-and-forth), and most building codes permit design forces to be calculated from the design spectrum on the basis of that frequency, but for more complex structures, combination of the results for many modes (calculated through modal analysis) is often required. In extreme cases, where structures are either too irregular, too tall or of significance to a community in disaster response, the response spectrum approach is no longer appropriate, and more complex analysis is required, such as non-linear static or dynamic analysis like in seismic performance analysis technique.

It is usually sung by bass-baritones such as Hans Hotter, Theo Adam or Bryn Terfel. Wagner himself calls this voice type \\"Hoher Bass\\" (high bass) rather than baritone. In his opera scores he distinguishes between the two so that Wolfram in \\"Tannh√§user\\" is labelled \\"Bariton\\", whereas Wotan in \\"Die Walk√ºre\\" is called \\"Hoher Bass\\". Wolfram is a much more lyrical part than Wotan, and normally the same singer would not have both parts on his repertoire. Heldenbaritone parts are different from dramatic baritone parts in Italian operas (such as Scarpia in Puccini's \\"Tosca\\" or Iago in Verdi's \\"Otello\\") in that the Italian parts have a much higher tessitura and the vocal line is much more like that of a dramatic tenor, whereas the Wagner Heldenbariton is in effect a bass singer with a high register and only occasionally stretches to the high notes of the dramatic Italian baritone. Other Heldenbaritone parts include Kaspar in Weber's \\"Der Freisch√ºtz\\", Jochanaan in Strauss' \\"Salome\\" and the title role in Verdi's \\"Falstaff\\". Voice types ","title":"Heldenbaritone"},{"id":"1795147","text":"The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (), abbreviated CPVPV and colloquially termed hai‚Äôa (committee), is a Saudi government religious authority charged with implementing the Islamic doctrine of hisbah. It traces its modern origin to a revival of the pre-modern official function of muhtasib (market inspector) by the first Saudi state (1745‚Äì1818). The committee was established in 1976 in its current form, with the main goal of supervising markets and public morality. It has been assisted by volunteers, and often described as Islamic religious police. It has been called mutawa, mutaween and by other similar names in English-language sources, with various translations. In the early 2010s, the committee was estimated to have 3,500‚Äì4,000 officers on the streets, assisted by thousands of volunteers, with an additional 10,000 administrative personnel. Committee officers and volunteers have been known to patrol public places, with volunteers focusing on enforcing strict rules of hijab, segregation between the sexes, and daily prayer attendance. Officers were authorized to pursue, detain and interrogate suspected violators prior to the 2016 reforms. Names The name of the committee has also been translated as Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Elimination of Sin, abberviated CAVES. They are known colloquially as hai‚Äôa (literally \\"committee\\", also transliterated as Haia or Hayaa). In academic sources, committee officers or the volunteers have also been called by several Arabic terms derived from the root ·π≠-w- ø, including muta·π≠awwi ø≈´n (, volunteers), mu·π≠awwi ø (, one who compels obedience), and mu·π≠ƒÅwi øa (no literal translation given). These words are etymologically related to the Quranically derived terms mu·π≠·π≠awwi øa and muta·π≠awwi øa (those who perform supererogatory deeds of piety). English-language press has used the names mutawa and mutaween.  History and structure  The committee's rationale is based on the classical Islamic doctrine of hisba, which is associated with the Quranic injunction of enjoining good and forbidding wrong, and refers to the duty of Muslims to promote moral rectitude and intervene when another Muslim is acting wrongly. In pre-modern Islamic history, its legal implementation was entrusted to a public official called muhtasib (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud, disturbance of public order and infractions against public morality. This office disappeared in the modern era everywhere in the Muslim world, including Arabia, but it was revived by the first Saudi state (1745‚Äì1818) and continued to play a role in the second (1823‚Äì87), due to its importance within Wahhabi doctrine. Under the third Saudi state, the most zealous followers of Ibn Sa'ud were appointed as muhtasibs, but their severity caused conflict with the local population and foreign pilgrims. In response, committees were established in Riyadh and Mecca in 1932 to check their excesses. In 1976 the committees were united under an official of ministerial rank, acting under direct royal command. The unified Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is mainly responsible for supervising markets and public order. It has been assisted by volunteers, who enforce attendance of daily prayers and gender segregation in public places. In 2009, the CPVPV created and formalized a special \\"Anti- Witchcraft Unit\\" to \\"educate the public about the evils of sorcery, investigate alleged witches, neutralize their cursed paraphernalia, and disarm their spells\\". The unit also had a hotline on the CPVPV website for Saudis to report any magic to local officials. In January 2012, Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh was appointed head of the mutaween. He \\"holds the rank of cabinet minister and reports directly to the king\\". His agency employs more than 4,000 \\"field officers\\" and reportedly has another 10,000 administrative personnel. Its 2013 budget was the equivalent of US$390 million. Enforcement The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice enforces traditional Islamic morality by arresting or helping to secure the arrest of people who engage in conduct that violates Islamic principles and values. They are tasked with enforcing conservative Islamic norms of behavior defined by Saudi authorities. They monitor observance of the dress code and ensure that shops are closed during prayer times. In some instances, they broke into private homes on suspicion of untoward behavior, though this attracted criticism from the public and the government. Upon being appointed head of the CPVPV, Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh identified \\"five areas the religious police should focus on\\": preserving Islam, preventing blackmail, combating sorcery, fighting human trafficking, and ensuring that no one disobeys the country's rulers. Saudi mutaween are often accompanied by the regular police, but also patrol without police escort. They recently launched a website on which un-Islamic behavior can be reported.Judicial flogging in Saudi Arabia at World Corporal Punishment Research.Saudi Arabia: Gross human rights abuses against women , Amnesty International. While on patrol, the duties of the Mutaween include, but are not restricted to: * ensuring that drugs including alcohol are not being traded. * checking that women wear the abaya, a traditional cloak. * making sure that men and women who are spotted together in public are related. * formerly, enforcing the ban on camera phones. This ban was enacted out of a fear that men would use them to secretly photograph women and publish them on the Internet without the consent of the subjects. The ban was enacted in April 2004 but was overturned in December that same year. * preventing the population from engaging in \\"frivolous\\" Western customs such as Valentine's Day. The punishment for such offenses is severe, often involving beatings and humiliation, and foreigners are not excluded from arrest. The mutaween encourage people to inform on others they know who are suspected of acting unvirtuously, and to punish such activities. In 2010, a 27-year-old Saudi man was sentenced to five years in prison, 500 lashes of the whip, and a SR50,000 fine after appearing in an amateur gay video online allegedly taken inside a Jeddah prison. According to an unnamed government source, \\"The District Court sentenced the accused in a homosexuality case that was referred to it by the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (the Hai‚Äôa) in Jeddah before he was tried for impersonating a security man and behaving shamefully and with conduct violating the Islamic teachings.\\" The case started when the Hai‚Äôa's staff arrested the man under charges of practicing homosexuality. He was referred to the Bureau for Investigation and Prosecution, which referred him to the District Court.Man gets prison, lashes for gay video  Adnan Al Shabrawi Saudi Gazette 22 November 2013. Among the Western practices suppressed by the mutaween is the celebration of Valentine's Day. Condemning the festivities as a \\"pagan feast\\", Mutaween inspect hotels, restaurants, coffeehouses, and gift shops on 14 February to prevent Muslim couples from giving each other Valentines or other presents. The sale of red roses, red stuffed animals, red greeting cards and other red gift items is banned, according to store owners.

Let us beware of her dangers and be careful.\\" Fulla dolls were designed and approved as more acceptable. In 2006 the police issued a decree banning the sale of dogs and cats, also seen as a sign of Western influence. The decree which applies to the Red Sea port city of Jeddah and the holy city of Mecca bans the sale of cats and dogs because \\"some youths have been buying them and parading them in public,\\" according to a memo from the municipal affairs ministry to Jeddah's city government.\\"Cats and dogs banned by Saudi religious police\\", NBC News, 18 December 2006. In 2013 two Saudi men were arrested for giving \\"free hugs to passersby\\". In December 2010 it was reported by Arab News that the Hai'a had launched a massive campaign against \\"sorcery\\" or \\"black magic\\" in the Kingdom.\\"Lawyers Say No To Sorcery Suits\\" Arab News. The prohibition includes \\"fortune tellers or faith healers\\". (Some people executed for sorcery following the announcement include a man from Najran province in June 2012, a Saudi woman in the province of Jawf, in December 2011, and a Sudanese man executed in September 2011. A Lebanese television presenter of a popular fortune-telling programme was arrested while on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia and sentenced to death, though after pressure from the Lebanese government and human rights groups, he was freed by the Saudi Supreme Court.) In May 2012, the head of the mutaween, Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, stated that anyone using social media sites, such as Twitter, \\"has lost this world and his afterlife\\". According to authors Harvey Tripp and Peter North, mutaween became involved in the city planning of the Eastern Province industrial city of Jubail sometime in the 1980s and 1990s. Halfway through the construction of that city the mutaween visited the engineering drawing office several times, first to insist that all planning maps included the direction of Mecca. On their second visit they ordered that city sewage lines (already built) not flow in the direction of Mecca. After being convinced that the curvature of the earth prevented this, the mutaween returned to insist that the drainage pipes of toilets inside the city's buildings also not violate this principle. The mutaween's demands came despite the fact that no Saudi building code mentioned their requirement and no other Saudi cities met it. While a good deal of the planners' and engineers' time was spent responding to the mutaween's concerns, the mutaween never returned to approve the contractor's solution and no pipes ended up having to be unearthed and redirected, leaving Tripp and North to conclude that Mutaween's \\"point\\" was not to protect Mecca but to demonstrate the supremacy of religion in Saudi Arabia to foreign builders. =Exemptions= The offices of Saudi Aramco, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, and foreign embassies are off limits to mutaween. Not off limits are personnel of Saudi government agencies. Hai‚Äôa have been known to detain government officials, (A male government employee minder of American journalist Karen Elliott House was detained for mixing of the sexes, causing her to wonder that \\"a government employee following the instructions of his ministry runs afoul of that same government's religious police.\\")  Restriction of powers  On 11 April 2016, the Saudi Council of Ministers issued a new regulation that limits the jurisdiction of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. The new regulation has 12 clauses; most notable of them are: Controversy =Alleged abuses= One of the most widely criticized examples of mutaween enforcement of Sharia law came in March 2002, when 15 young girls died of burns or smoke asphyxiation by an accidental fire that engulfed their public school in Mecca. According to two newspapers, the religious police forcibly prevented girls from escaping the burning school by locking the doors of the school from the outside, and barring firemen from entering the school to save the girls, beating some of the girls and civil defense personnel in the process. Mutaween would not allow the girls to escape or to be saved because they were 'not properly covered', and the mutaween did not want physical contact to take place between the girls and the civil defense forces for fear of sexual enticement.\\"Saudi police 'stopped' fire rescue\\", BBC News Online, London, 15 March 2002. The CPVPV denied the charges of beating or locking the gates, but the incident and the accounts of witnesses were reported in Saudi newspapers such as the Saudi Gazette and Al-Iqtisaddiyya. The result was a very rare public criticism of the group.Khaled Abou el Fadl, The great theft: Wrestling Islam from the extremists, Harper San Francisco, 2005, pp. 250‚Äì2. In May 2003, Al-Watan, a Saudi reform newspaper published several reports of people being mistreated by the police force, including the story of one woman from a remote southern town who had been beaten and held in solitary confinement for riding alone in the back of a taxi. In May 2007, a man alleged to have alcohol in his home (Salman Al-Huraisi) was reported by Arab News to have been arrested and beaten to death in his own home by CPVPV members in the Al Oraija district of Riyadh. \\"The father of the deceased said that commission members continued to beat his handcuffed son, even though he was already covered in blood, until he died\\" at the Oraija CPVPV center in Riyadh.Raid Qusti, \\"Commission Members Probed for Forced Entry and Murder\\", Arab News, Jeddah/Riyadh, 27 May 2007. Another man who died while in custody of the CPVPV was Ahmed Al-Bulawi. He was a driver for a woman with whom he was accused of being in a state of seclusion (when a man and an unrelated woman are together) and died after being taken to a CPVPV center in Tabuk in June 2007. According to Irfan Al-Alawi, \\"in both cases, the families of the victims took the mutawiyin to court, and in both instances (as in others) charges against the mutawiyin were postponed indefinitely or dropped.\\" A case of \\"sorcery\\" that led to a sentence of death which was overturned was that of Ali Hussain Sibat, the Lebanese host of the popular TV call-in show aired on satellite TV across the Middle East. Sibat was arrested in Medina by the CPVPV in May 2008, while visiting Saudi Arabia to perform the Umrah pilgrimage. Sibat was charged with \\"sorcery\\" for making predictions and giving advice to the audience on his show. On 9 November 2009, after court hearings not open to the public or a defense lawyer Sibat was sentenced to death. The case was upheld on appeal but after an international outcry was overturned by the Supreme Court on 11 November 2010. The case was controversial in part because neither the defendant or \\"victims\\" were Saudis, and the \\"crime\\" was not committed in Saudi Arabia. Mutaween suppression of religious activity by non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia is also controversial. Asia News alleges that \\"at least one million\\" Roman Catholics in the kingdom are being \\"denied pastoral care ... none of them can participate in mass while they are in Saudi Arabia ... Catechism for their children ‚Äì nearly 100,000 ‚Äì is banned.\\" It reports the arrest of a Catholic priest for saying mass. On 5 April 2006 a Catholic priest, \\"Fr. George [Joshua] had just celebrated mass in a private house when seven religious policemen (muttawa) broke into the house together with two ordinary policemen. The police arrested the priest and another person.\\"\\"Catholic priest arrested and expelled from Riyadh\\" , Asia News, Italy, 10 April 2006. In August 2008, a young Saudi woman who had converted to Christianity was reportedly burnt to death after having her tongue cut out by her father, a member of the Committee, though it was not an officially sanctioned act of punishment. In January 2013, the CPVPV marched into an educational exhibit of dinosaurs at a shopping center, \\"turned off the lights and ordered everyone out, frightening children and alarming their parents\\". It was not clear why the exhibit‚Äîwhich had been \\"featured at shopping centres across the Gulf for decades\\"‚Äîwas closed, and Saudis speculated irreverently as to the reason on Twitter. In September 2013 the entrance of a Saudi religious police building \\"was intentionally set on fire by assailants\\", according to the Hai'a. No one was hurt and no further information was provided by the police. In early 2014, the head of Hai'a, Sheikh Abdul Latif al-Sheikh was quoted in the Okaz daily newspaper as saying that \\"there are advocates of sedition within the Commission\\" for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and promised to remove them. =Internal dispute= In 2009, the head of the Hai'a in Mecca, Sheikh Ahmad Qasim al Ghamdi, stated that there was nothing wrong with men and women mixing in public places, and instructed his mutawa'a to not interfere with mixing. However religious conservatives pressured the national head of the Hai'a to fire him. \\"Within hours of the firing of the Sheikh Al Ghamdi, the Hai'a issued an embarrassing retraction: \`The information sent out today concerning administrative changes at some Hai'a offices, particularly those concerning Mecca and Hail, was inaccurate and the administration has requested editors not to publish it.\`\\" However the firing and the retraction of the firing became \\"major news\\". \\"Outraged conservatives went to Sheiksh Al Ghamdi's home, demanding to \`mix\` with his females... still other outraged opponents scrawled graffiti on his home,\\" according to journalist Karen Elliott House. =Involvement in politics= Other accusations leveled at the CPVPV include that some of its members have been involved in political subversion, and/or are ex-convicts/prisoners who became Hafiz (i.e. memorized the Quran) to reduce their prison sentences. Author Lawrence Wright has written of a conflict between the Mutaween and at least one allied imam and Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, the head of the Presidency of General Intelligence (Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah) between 1977 and 2001. After an imam denounced a female charitable organizations run by some of Turki's sisters and accused them of being \\"whores\\" during a Friday sermon, Turki demanded and received an apology. He then \\"secretly began monitoring members of the muttawa. He learned that many of them were ex-convicts whose only job qualification was that they had memorized the Quran to reduce their sentences.\\" But Turki believed they had become \\"so powerful\\" they \\"threatened to overthrow the government.\\"Lawrence Wright, The looming tower: Al Qaeda and the road to 9/11, Knopf, New York, 2006, p.149. Another instance when the CPVPV has opposed the Saudi government came in 2005 when the Minister of Labor announced a policy of staffing lingerie shops with women. The policy was intended to give employment to some of the millions of adult Saudi women unhappily stuck at home (only 14.6% of Saudi women work in the public and private sectors in the Kingdom), and to prevent mixing of the sexes in public (ikhtilat), between male clerks and women customers. Conservative Saudis opposed the policy maintaining that for a woman to work outside the house was against her fitrah (natural state). The few shops that employed women were \\"quickly closed\\" by the Hai'i who supported the conservative position. However, in 2011, during the Arab Spring, King Abdullah issued another decree giving lingerie shops‚Äîand then shops and shop departments specializing in other products for women, such as cosmetics, abayas and wedding dresses‚Äîone year to replace men workers with women. Further clashes followed between conservatives and Hai'a men on the one hand, and the ministry, women customers and employees at female-staffed stores on the other. In 2013, the Ministry and the Hai'a leadership met to negotiate new terms. In November 2013, 200 religious police signed a letter stating that female employment was causing such a drastic increase in instances of ikhtilat, that \\"their job was becoming impossible.\\" =Political use= According to one journalist with many years of experience in Saudi Arabia, Karen Elliott House, the Hai‚Äôa are sometimes used to balance the policies of the government; specifically a loose rein on the Hai'a acts to calm the displeasure of the strong religious conservative forces in Saudi society. When the king dismissed a member of the Council of Senior Religious Scholars in 2009 for condemning gender mixing at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, he compensated for it by doing \\"nothing to curb the country's religious police from roaming the kingdom's streets and harassing ordinary Saudis mixing with anyone of the opposite genders\\". Role According to the US Library of Congress Country Studies, mutawwiin > \\"have been integral to the Wahhabi movement since its inception. Mutawwiin > have served as missionaries, as enforcers of public morals, and as \`public > ministers of the religion\` who preach in the Friday mosque. Pursuing their > duties in Jiddah in 1806, the mutawwiin were observed to be \`constables for > the punctuality of prayers ... with an enormous staff in their hand, [who] > were ordered to shout, to scold and to drag people by the shoulders to force > them to take part in public prayers, five times a day.\`\\" Robert Lacey describes them as \\"vigilantes\\". \\"The righteous of every neighbourhood [that] banded themselves together into societies for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.\\" According to a study by Michael Cook, based on \\"Wahhabi writings and rulers' decrees\\" the role of commanding good and forbidding wrong developed a prominent place during the second Saudi emirate, and the first \\"documented instance of a formal committee to enforces the duty dates to 1926\\", when the official Saudi newspaper in Mecca published the news of its establishment. In 1976, the Al al-Sheikh director of the Committee gained a seat on the Saudi cabinet, strengthening its prestige. Following the November‚ÄìDecember 1979 Grand Mosque Seizure, when religion became more conservative in Saudi Arabia, > \\"people noticed that imams and religious folk seemed to have more money to > spend ... with the religious police benefiting most obviously from > government injections of cash. They started to appear in imposing new GMC > vans, with their once humble local committees of mutawwa ... taking on the > grander, \`Big Brother\` aura of their original, collective name ‚Äì Al Hayah, > \`the Commission\`. They developed attitude to match.\\" They were still, however, \\"essentially volunteers engaged in their own variety of social work.\\" The deaths of 15 young girls in 2002 in Mecca from the mutaween's refusal to let them leave a burning school was widely publicized and damaged the mutaween's image. In May 2006 it was announced that the committee would no longer be allowed to interrogate those it arrests for behavior deemed un-Islamic. Prior to this, commission members enjoyed almost total power to arrest, detain, and interrogate those suspected of violating the Sharia.\\"Reduced Powers for Morality Police\\" , Arab Reform Bulletin, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, July 2006.\\"Virtue Squads Toning Down Shows of Power in Saudi Arabia\\" Rob L. Wagner, The Media Line, 23 May 2010 In June 2007 the Saudi mutaween announced \\"the creation of a 'department of rules and regulations' to ensure the activities of commission members comply with the law, after coming under heavy pressure for the death of two people in its custody in less than two weeks\\".\\"Morality Police under Pressure\\" , Arab Reform Bulletin, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, June 2007. The governmental National Society for Human Rights criticised the behaviour of the religious police in May 2007 in its first report since its establishment in March 2004. In May 2006 the Interior Ministry issued a decree stating that \\"the role of the commission will end after it arrests the culprit or culprits and hands them over to police, who will then decide whether to refer them to the public prosecutor.\\" Time magazine ran a report about the mutaween in August 2007. It noted that \\"a campaign using text messages sent to mobile phones is calling on a million Saudis to declare that '2007 is the year of liberation.'\\" Despite statements of reform, the mutaween turned down Time's request for interviews.Scott Macleod,\\"Vice Squad\\", Time, New York, 26 July 2007. At the beginning of October 2012, during the Arab Spring, Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh announced that the powers of the mutawiyin would be significantly restricted. According to Irfan Al-Alawi, > They will be barred from making arrests, conducting interrogations, or > carrying out searches without a warrant from the local governor. They will > no longer stand at the entrances of shopping malls to keep women out who do > not adhere to the Wahhabi dress code or who are not accompanied by > \\"approved\\" men‚Äîhusbands, siblings, or parents. \\"Community volunteers\\", who were the original mutaween, were forbidden from joining Hai‚Äôa men on their rounds and pursuing, chastising, and interrogating miscreants, as \\"a religious duty\\". Field officers were also ordered to \\"approach people with a smile,\\" and forbidden from using their \\"private e-mails, cellphones, or social media accounts to receive and act on anonymous tips.\\" Other similar groups Outside Saudi Arabia, in Iran, the Guidance Patrol functions as the country's main public religious police, imposing Islamic dress codes and norms in public. The Taliban regime, or Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, also had a \\"Ministry of the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice\\" with a very similar religious policing function. The Taliban are thought to have borrowed the Saudi policing policy not only because they also had a strict Sharia law policy, but because of alleged financial and diplomatic support from Saudi Arabia.Ahmed Rashid, Taliban: Islam, oil and the new great game in Central Asia, Yale University Press, 2000, p. 201. According to a Pakistani journalist who spent much time among the Taliban, the Taliban who had been to Saudi Arabia before taking power in Afghanistan \\"were terribly impressed by the religious police and tried to copy that system to the letter\\".

On its summit stands an Iron Age hill fort, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\". Archaeology The hill fort is known, in archaeological circles, as Cadbury-Congresbury in order to differentiate it from the Cadbury Castle hillfort in South Cadbury. It appears to have been constructed in the Iron Age when one or more ramparts, with walls and ditches, were built on the steep slopes of the hill to defend an area covering some eight and a half acres. The remains of Iron Age round houses may still be seen inside. The hill fort was refortified around 400 and occupation extended into the sub-Roman period, from which much imported pottery has been recovered. It has been suggested that this was the monastery of Saint Congar after whom Congresbury was named. Excavation took place between 1968 and 1973, and was published in 1992 Rahtz, P (1992). Cadbury Congresbury 1968-73: a late Roman/Post-Roman Hilltop settlement in Somerset. BAR/BS 223 Mediterranean imports were found with 173 A-ware and 547 B-ware sherds and around 48 glass vessels. These suggest that the hill was the site of an elite settlement.  Wildlife  Cadbury Hill is a designated Local Nature Reserve. In 2009, a 19th-century agricultural stock pond ‚Äì previously hidden by undergrowth ‚Äì was restored by the Yatton & Congresbury Wildlife Action Group (YACWAG). The Local Nature Reserve comprises ancient semi-natural woodland, scrub and unimproved grassland. Species of interest include marsh tit, noctule bat, slow worm, wood anemone, bluebell, betony, small scabious, rock rose, small leaved lime. On the northern limestone slope grow hundreds of common spotted orchids. The hill fort itself has many ant hills, which are visited by green woodpeckers. The grassy plateau of the hill fort is owned and managed by Yatton and Congresbury Parish Councils and the rest, including a car park and former landfilled quarry, by North Somerset Council.

There were separate grants for English Dissenters and for Irish Presbyterian clergy. The money originally came from the monarch's privy purse as an ex gratia donation, but it later became an annual grant voted by Parliament. The Irish Regium Donum originated in a grant of ¬£1,200 pa to Presbyterian clergy in the north of Ireland made by William III in 1690 as a reward for the loyalty of Presbyterians during the war in Ireland following the Glorious Revolution. Queen Anne, when instituting \\"Queen Anne's Bounty\\" to augment poor Anglican livings, also added another ¬£800 pa to assist Presbyterian clergy in the rest of Ireland (an offer of similar assistance to English Dissenting Ministers was declined). The Irish Church Act 1869, whose main purpose was to disestablish the Anglican Church of Ireland, also discontinued the Irish Regium Donum (and the grant to the Roman Catholic St Patrick's College, Maynooth) from 1871; existing ministers continued to receive equivalent payment from the Church Temporalities Commission.Irish Church Act 1869 ss. 38‚Äì41 The English Regium Donum was instituted in 1723, originally ¬£500 pa to allow the payment of pensions of widows of Dissenting Ministers, but later increased to ¬£1,000 pa to also cover augmentation of income of living ministers. From Charles II onwards, there had been earlier royal donations to Dissenting clergymen, but political motives were suspected, and a proposed grant of ¬£1,000 pa by Queen Anne was declined. The Regium Donum was originally not publicised, and one eighteenth-century critic saw it as a secret bribe to Dissenters to support Sir Robert Walpole and to buy off any agitation against the civil disabilities of Dissenters (e.g. the Test and Corporation Acts). Reform of royal finances by Pitt the Younger resulted in the Regium Donum becoming a grant voted by Parliament, rather than a charge upon the Civil List. In principle, this changed it from an ex gratia payment to a forced donation by taxpayers (including those opposed to the religious views of those supported): the Regium Donum was therefore henceforth opposed (on the grounds of consistency) by some advocates of the disestablishment of the Church of England. There was growing opposition by organised Dissent; because of this, the government announced in 1851 that the Regium Donum would not be voted in subsequent years.

One example of this process is that of parrot fishes which bite off pieces of coral, digest the living tissue, and excrete the inorganic component as silt and sand. However, the term \\"coral\\" in coral sand is used loosely in this sense to mean limestone of recent biological origin; corals are not the dominant contributors of sand particles to most such deposits. Rather, remnant skeletal fragments of foraminifera, calcareous algae, molluscs, and crustaceans can predominate. Because it is composed of limestone, coral sand is acid-soluble. Environmental issues Coral sand mining is a significant industry in some areas, and can have damaging environmental effects. Over 500,000 tons of coral sand are mined annually from Mauritius. Many Comoros beaches have been scarred by sand mining. Over 250 tons of shells and corals were exported from Tanzania in 1974. Exploitive collection has moved from the depleted areas off Tanzania and Kenya to the islands of Zanzibar and Mafia. Such extensive mining can be very harmful to reef ecosystems and beaches. In an effort to prevent damage from reef sand mining, the Convention on international trade in endangered species urged parties to the convention to work for the conservation and sustainable use of the coral reef ecosystems.

It is a National Nature Reserve and a Special Area of Conservation. Part of it is a Geological Conservation Review site and an area of is Oxenbourne Down, which is designated a Local Nature Reserve. Part of it is a Scheduled Monument. It is a chalk hill and one of the highest points in Hampshire. It is also the highest point on the chalk ridge of the South Downs and the second highest point in the South Downs National Park after Blackdown in the Western Weald. Although only high, it qualifies as one of England's Marilyns. It is located within the borders of the Queen Elizabeth Country Park. The name Butser comes from the Old English Bryttes Oran meaning Briht's slope. Oran or Ora is Old English for flat topped hill and/or steep slope.Hampshire Place Names by Richard Coates Ensign Publications 1993 page 46 The flat summit is surrounded by a number of spurs. Iron Age ditches and banks divide the spurs from the summit although the purpose of these earthworks is unclear. There is evidence of lynchet farming on the southeast side of the hill. The age of the lynchets is unknown but Roman pottery has been brought to the surface by rabbit holes. There are aerial masts on the hill. The hill was purchased by Hampshire County Council in 1966. Prior to the purchase the summit was used for growing wheat but now the only farming activity is grazing. Butser Hill has a rich variety of flora and fauna located upon the hill. Butser Hill is in the top twenty Hampshire chalk grassland sites for its rich vascular flora, and is the richest chalk grassland site in Hampshire in terms of its bryophyte (125 species) and lichen (82 species) flora. As well as this, over 30 species of butterfly have been recorded, including populations of Duke of Burgundy and the Silver-spotted Skipper, making the area an important conservation area for many butterfly species. There is an annual Fell Run called the Butser Hill Challenge that involves running up and down the hill three times.  Miscellaneous  A spur of Butser Hill known as Little Butser was the original home of the Butser Ancient Farm experimental archaeology project.

Webster's New World Dictionary, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2010. 22 March 1846 ‚Äì 12 February 1886) was an English artist and illustrator, born in Chester. The Caldecott Medal was named in his honour. He exercised his art chiefly in book illustrations. His abilities as an artist were promptly and generously recognised by the Royal Academy. Caldecott greatly influenced illustration of children's books during the nineteenth century. Two books illustrated by him, priced at a shilling each, were published every Christmas for eight years. Caldecott also illustrated novels and accounts of foreign travel, made humorous drawings depicting hunting and fashionable life, drew cartoons and he made sketches of the Houses of Parliament inside and out, and exhibited sculptures and paintings in oil and watercolour in the Royal Academy and galleries. Early life Caldecott was born at 150 Bridge Street (now No 16), Chester, where his father, John Caldecott, was an accountant, twice married with thirteen children. Caldecott was his father‚Äôs third child by his first wife, Mary Dinah Brookes. In 1848, the family moved to Challoner House, Crook Street, Chester, and in 1860 to 23 Richmond Place, Boughton, a village just outside the city. From his early childhood, Caldecott drew and modelled, mostly animals. His main education came with five years at the King's School, Chester, a grammar school then in the cathedral precinct in the city centre, which he left at the age of fifteen. In that same year, 1861, he first had a drawing published, a sketch of a disastrous fire at the Queens Railway Hotel in Chester, which appeared in the Illustrated London News, together with his account of the blaze. On leaving school, Caldecott went to work as a clerk at the offices of the Whitchurch & Ellesmere Bank in Whitchurch, Shropshire, and took lodgings at Wirswall, a village near the town. When he was out on errands, he was either walking or riding around the countryside, and many of his later illustrations incorporate buildings and scenery of Cheshire and that part of Shropshire. Caldecott‚Äôs love of riding led him to take up fox hunting, and his experiences in the hunting field and his love of the chase bore fruit over the years in a mass of drawings and sketches of hunting scenes, many of them humorous. Manchester A pen and ink drawing Caldecott had published in a Manchester newspaperBlackburn (1890), 10 After six years at Whitchurch, Caldecott moved to the head office in Manchester of the Manchester & Salford Bank. He lodged variously in Aberdeen Street, Rusholme Grove and at Bowdon. He took the opportunity to study at night school at the Manchester School of Art and practised continually, with success in local papers and some London publications. It was a habit of his at this time, which he maintained all his life, to decorate his letters, papers and documents of all descriptions with marginal sketches to illustrate the content or provide amusement. A number of his letters have been reprinted with their illustrations in Yours Pictorially, a book edited by Michael Hutchings. In 1870, a painter friend in London, Thomas Armstrong, put Caldecott in touch with Henry Blackburn, the editor of London Society, who published a number of his drawings in several issues of the monthly magazine. London Encouraged by this evidence of his ability to support himself by his art, Caldecott decided to quit his job and move to London; this he did in 1872 at the age of 26. Within two years he had become a successful magazine illustrator working on commission. His work included individual sketches, illustrations of other articles and a series of illustrations of a holiday which he and Henry Blackburn took in the Harz Mountains in Germany. The latter became the first of a number of such series. The House that Jack Built\\", from The Complete Collection of Pictures & Songs, published 1887. Digitally restored He remained in London for seven years, spending most of them in lodgings at 46 Great Russell Street just opposite the British Museum, in the heart of Bloomsbury. While there he met and made friends (as he did very readily) with many artistic and literary people, among them Dante Gabriel Rossetti, George du Maurier (who was a fellow contributor to Punch), John Everett Millais and Frederic Leighton. His friendship with Frederic (later Lord) Leighton led to a commission to design peacock capitals for four columns in the Arab room at Leighton's rather exotic home, Leighton House in Kensington. (Walter Crane designed a tiled peacock frieze for the same room.) In 1869 Caldecott exhibited a picture in the Royal Manchester Institute. He had a picture exhibited in the Royal Academy for the first time in 1876. He was also a watercolourist and was elected to the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1882. In 1877 Edmund Evans, who was a leading colour printer using coloured woodblocks, lost the services of Walter Crane as his children's book illustrator and asked Caldecott for illustrations for two Christmas books. The results were The House that Jack Built and The Diverting History of John Gilpin, published in 1878. They were an immediate success; so much so that Caldecott produced two more each year for Evans until he died. Many of Evans‚Äô original printing blocks survive and are held at St Bride Library in London. The stories and rhymes were all of Caldecott's choosing and in some cases were written or added to by himself. In another milieu Caldecott followed The Harz Mountains with illustrations for two books by Washington Irving, three for Juliana Ewing, another of Henry Blackburn's, one for Captain Frederick Marryat and for other authors. Among well known admirers of his work were Gauguin and Van Gogh. Randolph continued to travel, partly for the sake of his health, and to make drawings of the people and surroundings of the places he visited; these drawings were accompanied by humorous and witty captions and narrative. Marriage In 1879 he moved to Wybornes, a house near Kemsing in Kent. It is there that he became engaged to Marian Brind, who lived at Chelsfield about seven miles away. They were married on 18 MarchIn a postscript to a letter dated 17 March 1880 from Caldecott to Victorian poet Frederick Locker-Lampson he says \\"I am to be wed tomorrow 18th\\" 1880 and lived at Wybornes for the next two years. There were no children of the marriage. In the autumn of 1882 the Caldecotts left Kent and bought a house, Broomfield, at Frensham in Surrey; they also rented No 24 Holland Street, Kensington. By 1884, sales of Caldecott's Nursery Rhymes had reached 867,000 copies (of twelve books) and he was internationally famous. Death Memorial to Randolph Caldecott in Chester Cathedral Caldecott's health was generally poor and he suffered much from gastritis and a heart condition going back to an illness in his childhood. It was his health among other things which prompted his many winter trips to the Mediterranean and other warm climates. It was on such a tour in the United States of America in 1886 that he was taken ill again and died. He and Marian had sailed to New York and travelled to Florida in an unusually cold February; Randolph was taken ill and died at St. Augustine. He was not quite 40 years old. A headstone marks his grave in the cemetery there. Soon after his early death, his many friends contributed to a memorial, which was designed by Sir Alfred Gilbert. It was placed in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London. There is also a memorial to him in Chester Cathedral. Appreciation Gleeson White wrote of Caldecott: G. K. Chesterton wrote in a Caldecott picture book that he presented to a young friend: :This is the sort of book we like : (For you and I are very small), :With pictures stuck in anyhow, : And hardly any words at all. : . . . :You will not understand a word : Of all the words, including mine; :Never you trouble; you can see, : And all directness is divine‚Äî :Stand up and keep your childishness: : Read all the pedants‚Äô screeds and strictures; :But don‚Äôt believe in anything : That can‚Äôt be told in coloured pictures.Alfred George Gardiner, \\"Prophets, Priests and Kings\\", Alston Rivers Ltd., 1908, p. 327 For Maurice Sendak \\"Caldecott's work heralds the beginning of the modern picture book. He devised an ingenious juxtaposition of picture and word, a counterpoint that never happened before. Words are left out‚Äîbut the picture says it. Pictures are left out‚Äîbut the word says it.\\" Sendak also appreciated the subtle darkness of Caldecott's work: \\"You can't say it's a tragedy, but something hurts.

It is the SNES equivalent of the Star Wars NES game. Super Star Wars features mostly run and gun gameplay, although it has stages which feature other challenges, such as driving a landspeeder or piloting an X-wing. It also features multiple playable characters with different abilities. The game was followed by two sequels based on the subsequent Star Wars films, Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1993) and Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1994).  Gameplay  Gameplay Super Star Wars generally follows the plot of Star Wars, although some allowances were made to adapt the story to suit an action game. For example, instead of simply buying C-3PO and R2-D2 from the Jawas, Luke Skywalker must fight his way to the top of a Jawa sandcrawler while leaping from a series of moving conveyor belts. Brief cutscenes between levels tell an abbreviated version of the film's story through written text. Later stages allow the player to control smuggler and pilot Han Solo or Chewbacca the Wookiee. The game also features several vehicle-based levels in which the player takes control of an X-Wing or a landspeeder. Most of the stages consist of run and gun and platforming gameplay, with several different upgrades available to the standard blaster weapon. Luke can also wield a lightsaber after acquiring it from Obi Wan Kenobi. The end of the game has players reenacting Luke's Death Star trench run to destroy the Death Star, with Darth Vader confronting the player in his TIE Advanced x1.  Development  Artist Jon Knoles did the visual designs for the characters, while Harrison Fong drew the backgrounds. Fong recounted that he did very little concept drawing before rendering the characters on the computer \\"because everybody knew what the Star Wars characters looked like.\\" Originally, the game design was planned to give the characters a dark black outline around their bodies. However, this idea was abandoned, as it was thought to make the characters too cartoonish-looking. The \\"Kalhar Boss Monster\\" is based on one of the chess pieces R2D2 plays with on the Millennium Falcon in the film. There was a trash compactor level that was deleted from the game due to lack of cartridge space. An image was published in an issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly around the time of the game's release. The game's audio contains scores from the movie, which were all arranged by Sculptured Software's in-house musician Paul Webb. According to Webb, he was given the original handwritten scores that John Williams had created. Paul then used the company's in-house music software to convert the scores onto the SNES's 8-channel sound chip. The game's instrument samples were taken from the Ensoniq EPS and EPS16 keyboards. A PC port of Super Star Wars was in the works since 1994, by Danish game company Brain Bug and produced by Softgold. The game was almost completed, and was well into the playtesting phase, but in 1995 LucasArts decided to halt the development and cancel the release. An unfinished version of this port was leaked onto the internet, but as of 2015 LucasArts has not yet released the game into public domain. A Mega Drive version was in the works by Sega Interactive from late 1992 to some point in 1993, when it was cancelled for unknown reasons. An early prototype's ROM was dumped in 2020.  Reception  Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"If you've ever fantasized about piloting an X-wing fighter into the heart of the Death Star, now you can do it‚Äîin simulated 3-D as well as reenact the movie's key plot developments.\\" Super Star Wars was awarded Best Action/Adventure Game of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly, as well as Best Movie-to-Game. Re- releases Super Star Wars was re-released in November 1996 as part of Nintendo's Player's Choice series. The game was released for the Wii Virtual Console on August 10, 2009. The game was digitally re-released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on November 17, 2015 and in the UK on November 24, 2015. The port features enhanced options for saving, leaderboards and trophies, and modern displays and controllers. The game was also made a part of a bundle with the purchase of Star Wars Battlefront for the PlayStation 4, which included Star Wars: Racer Revenge, Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter and Star Wars Bounty Hunter.

This is in contrast to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which scan the entire genome for common genetic variation. Candidate genes are most often selected for study based on a priori knowledge of the gene's biological functional impact on the trait or disease in question. The rationale behind focusing on allelic variation in specific, biologically relevant regions of the genome is that certain mutations will directly impact the function of the gene in question, and lead to the phenotype or disease state being investigated. This approach usually uses the case-control study design to try to answer the question, \\"Is one allele of a candidate gene more frequently seen in subjects with the disease than in subjects without the disease?\\" Candidate genes hypothesized to be associated with complex traits have generally not been replicated by subsequent GWASs. The failure of candidate gene studies to shed light on the specific genes underlying such traits has been ascribed to insufficient statistical power. Selection Suitable candidate genes are generally selected based on known biological, physiological, or functional relevance to the disease in question. This approach is limited by its reliance on existing knowledge about known or theoretical biology of disease. However, molecular tools are allowing insight into disease mechanisms and pinpointing potential regions of interest in the genome. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping examine common variation across the entire genome, and as such can detect a new region of interest that is in or near a potential candidate gene. Microarray data allow researchers to examine differential gene expression between cases and controls, and can help pinpoint new potential genes of interest. The great variability between organisms can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish normal variation in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from a candidate gene with disease-associated variation. In analyzing large amounts of data, there are several other factors that can help lead to the most probable variant. These factors include priorities in SNPs, relative risk of functional change in genes, and linkage disequilibrium among SNPs. In addition, the availability of genetic information through online databases enables researchers to mine existing data and web-based resources for new candidate gene targets. Many online databases are available to research genes across species. * Gene is one such database that allows access to information about phenotypes, pathways, and variations of many genes across species. * When examining functionality between genes in pathways, the Gene Ontology Consortium can help map these relationships. The GO Project describes gene products in three different ways via a species-independent manner: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Using this information can further a priori knowledge of a pathway and thus help to choose the most likely candidate gene involved. * Topp Gene is another useful database that allows users to prioritize candidate genes using functional annotations or network analysis. ToppGene aids researchers in selecting a subset of likely candidate genes from larger sets of candidate genes, likely discovered through high-throughput genome technologies. *Lynx is an integrated systems biology platform that allows users to prioritize candidate genes using both functional annotations and gene pairwise association networks. Lynx provides two sophisticated prioritization tools, Cheetoh and PINTA, to help users select candidate genes from the whole genome based on the relevance to input gene list which can be a list of known genes contributing to certain disease or phenotype, or differentially expressed gene from next-generation RNA sequencing technology. Prior to the candidate-gene approach Before the candidate-gene approach was fully developed, various other methods were used to identify genes linked to disease-states. These methods studied genetic linkage and positional cloning through the use of a genetic screen, and were effective at identifying relative risk genes in Mendelian diseases. However, these methods are not as beneficial when studying complex diseases for several reasons: # Complex diseases tend to vary in both age of onset and severity. This can be due to variation in penetrance and expressivity. For most human diseases, variable expressivity of the disease phenotype is the norm. This makes choosing one specific age group or phenotypic marker more difficult to select for study. # The origins of complex disease involve many biological pathways, some of which may differ between disease phenotypes. # Most importantly, complex diseases often illustrate genetic heterogeneity ‚Äì multiple genes can be found that interact and produce one disease state. Oftentimes, each single gene is partially responsible for the phenotype produced and overall risk for the disorder. Despite the drawbacks of linkage analysis studies, they are nevertheless useful in preliminary studies to isolate genes linked to disease. Criticisms A study of candidate genes seeks to balance the use of data while attempting to minimize the chance of creating false positive or negative results. Because this balance can often be difficult, there are several criticisms of the candidate gene approach that are important to understand before beginning such a study. For instance, the candidate-gene approach has been shown to produce a high rate of false positives, which requires that the findings of single genetic associations be treated with great caution. One critique is that findings of association within candidate-gene studies have not been easily replicated in follow up studies. For instance, a recent investigation on 18 well-studied candidate genes for depression (10 publications or more each) failed to identify any significant association with depression, despite using samples orders of magnitude larger than those from the original publications. In addition to statistical issues (e.g. underpowered studies), population stratification has often been blamed for this inconsistency; therefore caution must also be taken in regards to what criteria define a certain phenotype, as well as other variations in design study. Additionally, because these studies incorporate a priori knowledge, some critics argue that our knowledge is not sufficient to make predictions from. Therefore, results gained from these 'hypothesis-driven' approaches are dependent on the ability to select plausible candidates from the genome, rather than use an anonymous approach. The limited knowledge of complex disease can result in 'information bottleneck', which can be overcome by comparative genomics across different species. This bias can also be overcome by carefully choosing genes based on what factors are most likely to be involved in phenotype. These critiques are important to remember as one examines their experimental approach. With any other scientific method, the candidate gene approach itself is subject to critique, but still proven to be a powerfully effective tool for studying the genetic makeup of complex traits. Use in research studies The candidate gene approach is a powerful tool to studying complex diseases, particularly if its limitations are overcome by a wide complementary approach. One of the earliest successes in this field was finding a single base mutation in the non-coding region of the APOC3 (apolipoprotein C3 gene) that associated with higher risks of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis. In a study by Kim et al., genes linked to the obesity trait in both pigs and humans were discovered using comparative genomics and chromosomal heritability. By using these two methods, the researchers were able to overcome the criticism that candidate gene studies are solely focused on prior knowledge. Comparative genomics was completed by examining both human and pig quantitative trait loci through a method known as genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which allowed the researchers to then map genetic variance to specific chromosomes. This allowed the parameter of heritability to provide understanding of where phenotypic variation was on specific chromosomal regions, thus extending to candidate markers and genes within these regions. Other studies may also use computational methods to find candidate genes in a widespread, complementary way, such as one study by Tiffin et al. studying genes linked to type 2 diabetes. Many studies have similarly used candidate genes as part of a multi- disciplinary approach to examining a trait or phenotype. One example of manipulating candidate genes can be seen in a study completed by Martin E. Feder on heat-shock proteins and their function in Drosophila melanogaster. Feder designed a holistic approach to study Hsp70, a candidate gene that was hypothesized to play a role in how an organism adapted to stress. D. melanogaster is a highly useful model organism for studying this trait due to the way it can support a diverse number of genetic approaches for studying a candidate gene. The different approaches this study took included both genetically modifying the candidate gene (using site-specific homologous recombination and the expression of various proteins), as well as examining the natural variation of Hsp70. He concluded that the results of these studies gave a multi-faceted view of Hsp70. The manipulation of candidate genes is also seen in Caspar C. Chater's study of the origin and function of stomata in Physcomitrella patens, a moss. PpSMF1, PpSMF2 and PpSCRM1 were the three candidate genes that were knocked down by homologous recombination to see any changes in the development of stomata. With the knock down experiment, Chater observed that PpSMF1 and PpSCRM1 were responsible for stomata development in P. patens. By engineering and modifying these candidate genes, they were able to confirm the ways in which this gene was linked to a change phenotype. Understanding the natural and historical context in which these phenotypes operate by examining the natural genome structure complemented this.

However Baugh later claimed that the bones were found in Cretaceous deposits.\\" One of Baugh's more famous claims, aside from the dinosaur tracks, is the London Hammer, an alleged out of place artifact of an \\"18th century miner's hammer\\" found in million-year-old Ordovician rock (he has also claimed it is in Cretaceous rock) found in 1934 from London, Texas. Baugh asserted this as evidence against scientifically known ways that rocks form. However, laboratory tests discounted his claim about the hammer's being formed in the rock. J.R. Cole wrote, \\"The stone concretion is real, and it looks impressive to someone unfamiliar with geological processes. How could a modern artifact be stuck in Ordovician rock? The answer is that the concretion itself is not Ordovician. Minerals in solution can harden around an intrusive object dropped in a crack or simply left on the ground if the source rock (in this case, reportedly Ordovician) is chemically soluble.\\"Cole, J. R. 1985. \\"If I had a Hammer\\" Creation/Evolution, Issue XV, pp.46‚Äì47 In July 2008, Baugh was in contact with Alvis Delk and James Bishop, who claimed to have found a dinosaur-human print fossil. Baugh bought the \\"fossil\\" from Delk who used the money to pay his medical bills. On the authenticity of the claims, reporter Bud Kennedy noted, \\"since no scientists were involved, about all we really know so far is that the museum has a new rock.\\" This was deemed \\"not a convincing human footprint in ancient rock\\" by biologist Glen J. Kuban and called a \\"blatant fake\\" by biologist PZ Myers. Creationist organizations such as Answers in Genesis have criticized Baugh's claims saying he \\"muddied the water for many Christians. . . . People are being misled.\\" Don Batten, of Creation Ministries International wrote: \\"Some Christians will try to use Baugh's 'evidences' in witnessing and get 'shot down' by someone who is scientifically literate. The ones witnessed to will thereafter be wary of all creation evidences and even more inclined to dismiss Christians as nut cases not worth listening to.\\" Answers in Genesis (AiG) lists the \\"Paluxy tracks\\" as arguments \\"we think creationists should NOT use\\" [emphasis in original]. Also Answers In Creation reviewed Baugh's museum and concluded \\"the main artifacts they claim show a young earth reveal that they are deceptions, and in many cases, not even clever ones.\\" In his 1992 book Panorama of Creation, Baugh claims that a layer of metallic hydrogen surrounded the early earth. Furthermore, he professes that hexagonal water, or, \\"Creation water\\" as he calls it, is capable of healing. Such claims have been addressed by scientists as pseudoscience, and his hypotheses and credentials are not accepted in academia. Baugh has claimed several college degrees, at one point professing to earning three doctorates, when no evidence exists that he even graduated from high school.A Matter of Degree: Carl Baugh's Alleged Credentials by Glen J.

The schools were developed in working-class districts. Ragged schools were intended for society's most destitute children. Such children, it was argued, were often excluded from Sunday School education because of their unkempt appearance and often challenging behaviour. The London Ragged Schools Union was established in April 1844 to combine resources in the city, providing free education, food, clothing, lodging and other home missionary services for poor children. Although the London Ragged School Union did not extend beyond the metropolis, its publications and pamphlets helped spread ragged school ideals across the country. They were phased out by the final decades of the 19th century. Working in the poorest districts, teachers (who were often local working people) initially utilized stables, lofts, and railway arches for their classes. The majority of teachers were voluntary, although a small number were employed. There was an emphasis on reading, writing, arithmetic, and study of the Bible. The curriculum expanded into industrial and commercial subjects in many schools. It is estimated that about 300,000 children went through the London ragged schools alone between 1844 and 1881. The Ragged School Museum in the East End of London shows how a ragged school would have looked; it is housed in buildings previously occupied by Dr Thomas Barnardo. The Ragged School Museum provides an idea of the working of a ragged school, but Thomas Barnardo's institution differed considerably in practice and philosophy from those schools accountable to the London Ragged School Union. Early days Several different schools claim to have pioneered truly free education for impoverished children. For many of the destitute children of London, going to school each day was not an option. From the 18th century onwards, schools for poor children were few and far between. They had been started in areas where someone had been concerned enough to want to help disadvantaged children towards a better life. In the late eighteenth century Thomas Cranfield offered free education for poor children in London. While he was a tailor by trade, Cranfield's educational background included studies at a Sunday school on Kingsland Road, Hackney. In 1798, he established a free children's day school on Kent Street near London Bridge. By the time of his death in 1838, he had established 19 free schools providing services for children and infants living in the lower-income areas of London. These opportunities and services were offered days, nights, and on Sundays, for the destitute children of poor families throughout London.Eager, W. McG. Making Men: the history of the Boys' Clubs and related movements in Great Britain, London:University of London Press, 1953, p. 121 John Pounds, a Portsmouth shoemaker, provided important inspiration for the movement. At the age of twelve Pounds' father arranged for him to be apprenticed as a shipwright. Three years later, he fell into a dry dock and was crippled for life after damaging his thigh. Unable to work as a shipwright, John became a shoemaker and, by 1803, had his own shop in St Mary Street, Portsmouth. In 1818, Pounds, known as the crippled cobbler, began teaching poor children without charging fees. He actively recruited children and young people to his school. He spent time on the streets and quays of Portsmouth making contact and even bribing them to come with the offer of baked potatoes.Caroline Cornwallis, 'The Philosophy of the Ragged Schools' (London: Pickering, 1851), p. 43. He began teaching local children reading, writing, and arithmetic. His reputation as a teacher grew and he soon had more than 40 students attending his lessons. He also gave lessons in cooking, carpentry and shoemaking. Pounds died in 1839. Pounds quickly became a figurehead for the schools; his ethos was used as an inspiration for the later movement. In 1841 Sheriff Watson established a school in Aberdeen, Scotland. In contrast to the earlier efforts of Pounds and Cranfield, Watson used compulsion to increase attendance at the institution. Watson was frustrated by the number of children who committed a petty crime and faced him in his courtroom. Rather than sending them to prison for vagrancy, Watson established a school for boys. As a law official, the sheriff arrested the vagrant children and enrolled them in school. The Industrial Feeding School opened to provide reading, writing and arithmetic. Watson believed that gaining these skills would help the boys rise above the lowest level of society. It was not confined to the 'three R's', however, as the young scholars also received instruction on geology.W. Watson, 'Chapters on Ragged and Industrial Schools' (Edinburgh: Blackwood and Sons, 1872), p. 16. Three meals a day were provided and the boys were taught useful trades such as shoemaking and printing. A school for girls followed in 1843. In 1845, the schools were integrated. From here, the movement spread to Dundee and other parts of Scotland. The statue of Thomas Guthrie on Princes Street, Edinburgh The same year that Watson established his school in Aberdeen, the Field Lane ragged school began in Clerkenwell, London. Historians have debated how connected the movement was between England and Scotland. E.A.G. Clark argued that 'the London and Scottish schools had little in common except their name'.E.A.G. Clark, 'The Ragged School Union and the Education of the London Poor in the Nineteenth Century' (unpublished Master‚Äôs thesis, University of London, 1967), pp. 8-9. More recently, Laura Mair has demonstrated that literature, philosophy and passionate individuals were shared between schools. She writes that 'schools forged significant links across cities and countries that disregarded physical distance'.Laura M. Mair '\\"The Only Friend I have in this World\\": Ragged School Relationships in England and Scotland, 1844-1870' (unpublished PhD thesis, University of Edinburgh, 2017), p. 60., It was S. R. Starey, the secretary of the Field Lane ragged school, who first applied the term 'ragged' to the institutions in an advert he submitted to The Times seeking public support.Mair, pp. 52-53 Although the Edinburgh Original Ragged School, established by the Reverend Thomas Guthrie in April 1847, was not the first ragged school in Scotland, Guthrie was later acknowledged as a core leader of the movement. His 'Plea for Ragged Schools', published in March 1847 to garner the public's support for a school in the city, laid out his indisputable arguments that proved highly influential. Guthrie was first introduced to the idea of ragged schools in 1841, while acting as the Parish Minister of St. John's Church in Edinburgh. On a visit to Anstruther in Fife, he saw a picture of John Pounds in Portsmouth and felt inspired and humbled by the cobbler's work. Birth of the organisation Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury In April 1844, Locke, Moutlon, Morrison, and Starey formed a steering committee to address the social welfare needs of the community. On 11 April 1844, at 17 Ampton Street off the Grays Inn Road, they facilitated a public meeting to determine local interest, research feasibility, and establish structure. This was the birth of the Ragged Schools Union. In 1944, the Union adopted the name \\"Shaftesbury Society\\" in honour of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. In 2007, the Society was merged with John Grooms, taking the new name of Livability. Mr Locke of the Ragged School Union called for more help in keeping the schools open. Many petitions for funding and grants were made to Parliament to assist with educational reform. He asked the government to give more thought to preventing crime, rather than punishing the wrongdoers. He said the latter course only made the young criminals worse. In 1840, the Mission used the term \\"ragged\\" in its Annual Report to describe their establishment of five schools for 570 children. In the report, the Mission reported that their schools had been formed exclusively for children \\"raggedly clothed\\". The children only had very ragged clothes to wear and they rarely had shoes. In other words, they did not own clothing suitable to attend any other kind of school.Montague, C.J. Sixty Years in Waifdom. Or, the Ragged School Movement in English history, London:Charles Murray, 1904, p. 34 =Prominent supporters= Several people volunteered and offered their time, skills, and talents as educators and administrators of the ragged schools. Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury was one of Britain's greatest social reformers, whose broad-ranging concerns included education, animal welfare, public health and improving working conditions. In 1844 Lord Shaftesbury became the president of the ragged schools. He used his knowledge of the schools and refuges and his understanding of the living conditions among low-income families to pursue changes in legislation. He served as the president of the London Ragged School Union for 39 years. In 1944 the Union adopted the name \\"Shaftesbury Society\\" in his honour. Shaftesbury maintained his commitment to the Ragged Schools and educational reform until his death in 1885. Charles Dickens, 1858 In 1843, Charles Dickens began his association with the schools and visited the Field Lane Ragged School.History of Field Lane Ragged School He was appalled by the conditions, yet moved toward reform.Charles Dickens and the Ragged Schools The experience inspired him to write A Christmas Carol. While he initially intended to write a pamphlet on the plight of poor children, he realised that a dramatic story would have more impact. Dickens continued to support the schools, donating funds on various occasions. At one point, he donated funds, along with a water trough, stating that it was \\"so the boys may wash and for a supervisor\\"! (from a letter to Field Lane). He later wrote about the school and his experience there in Household Words. In 1837, he used the street called Field Lane as a setting for Fagin's den in his classic novel, Oliver Twist. Growth of the organisation By 1844, there were at least 20 free schools for the poor, maintained through the generosity of community philanthropists, the volunteers working with their local churches, and the organisational support of the London City Mission. During this time, it was suggested that it would be beneficial to establish an official organisation or society to share resources and promote their common cause. In April 1844 the London Ragged School Union was founded during a meeting of four men to pray for the city's poor children. Starey, the secretary of Field Lane school, was present. There was a massive growth in the numbers of schools, teachers and students. By 1851, the number of educators would grow to include around 1,600 persons. By 1867, some 226 Sunday Ragged Schools, 204-day schools and 207 evening schools provided a free education for about 26,000 students. However, the schools were heavily reliant on volunteers and continually faced problems in finding and keeping staff. Women played an important role as volunteer teachers. A newspaper report on the progress of the schools announced that 'the most valuable teachers in ragged schools are those of the female sex'.Mair, p. 83. The ragged school movement became respectable, even fashionable, attracting the attention of many wealthy philanthropists. Wealthy individuals such as Angela Burdett- Coutts gave large sums of money to the London Ragged School Union. This helped to establish 350 ragged schools by the time the 1870 Education Act was passed.History of the Ragged Schools As Eager (1953) explains, \\"He [who? Antecedent not clear.]gave what had been a Nonconformist undertaking, the cachet of his Tory churchmanship ‚Äì an important factor at a time when even broad-minded (Anglican) churchmen thought that Nonconformists should be fairly credited with good intentions, but that cooperation (with them) was undesirable\\".Eager, W. McG. Making Men: the history of the Boys' Clubs and related movements in Great Britain, London:University of London Press, 1953, p. 123 Legacy of the ragged schools Ragged School Museum The success of the ragged schools definitively demonstrated that there was a demand for education among the poor. In response, England and Wales established school boards to administer elementary schools. However, education was still not free of fees. After 1870 public funding began to be provided for elementary education among working people. School boards were public bodies created in boroughs and parishes under the Elementary Education Act 1870 following campaigning by George Dixon, Joseph Chamberlain and the National Education League for elementary education that was free from Anglican doctrine. Members to the board were directly elected, not appointed by borough councils or parishes. As the school boards were built and funded, the demand for ragged schools declined. The Board Schools continued in operation for 32 years. They were officially abolished by the Education Act 1902, which replaced them with local education authorities. =Ragged School Museum= Dr Thomas Barnardo Founded in 1990, a Ragged School Museum occupies a group of three canalside buildings on Copperfield Road in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets that once housed the largest ragged school in London; the buildings had previously been used by Dr Thomas Barnardo. Barnardo arrived in London in 1866, planning to train as a doctor and become a missionary in China. In London, he was confronted by a city where disease was rife, poverty and overcrowding endemic and educational opportunities for the poor nonexistent. He watched helplessly as a cholera epidemic swept through the East End, leaving more than 3,000 Londoners dead and many destitute. He gave up his medical training to pursue his local missionary works and in 1867, opened his first ragged school, where children could gain a free basic education. Ten years later, Barnardo's Copperfield Road School opened its doors to children, and for the next thirty- one years it educated tens of thousands of children. It closed in 1908, by which time enough government schools had opened in the area to serve the needs of local families. The buildings, originally warehouses for goods transported along the Regent's Canal, then went through a variety of industrial uses until, in the early 1980s, they were threatened with demolition. A group of local people joined together to save them and reclaim their unique heritage. The Ragged School Museum Trust was set up and the museum opened in 1990. The museum was founded to make the history of the ragged schools and the broader social history of the East End accessible to all. An authentic Victorian classroom has been set up within the original buildings, in which 14,000 children each year experience a school lesson as it would have been taught more than 100 years ago.

A pronucleus (plural: pronuclei) is the nucleus of a sperm or an egg cell during the process of fertilization. The sperm cell becomes a pronucleus after the sperm enters the ovum, but before the genetic material of the sperm and egg fuse. Contrary to the sperm cell, the egg cell has a pronucleus once it becomes haploid, and not when the sperm cell arrives. Sperm and egg cells are haploid, meaning they carry half the number of chromosomes of somatic cells, so in humans, haploid cells have 23 chromosomes, while somatic cells have 46 chromosomes. The male and female pronuclei don't fuse, although their genetic material does. Instead, their membranes dissolve, leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes. Their chromosomes can then combine and become part of a single diploid nucleus in the resulting embryo, containing a full set of chromosomes. The appearance of two pronuclei is the first sign of successful fertilization as observed during in vitro fertilisation, and is usually observed 18 hours after insemination or ICSI. The zygote is then termed a two- pronuclear zygote (2PN). Two-pronuclear zygotes transitioning through 1PN or 3PN states tend to develop into poorer-quality embryos than ones who remain 2PN throughout development, and may be significant in embryo selection in IVF. History The pronucleus was discovered the 1870s microscopically using staining techniques combined with microscopes with improved magnification levels. The pronucleus was originally found during the first studies on meiosis. Edouard Van Beneden published a paper in 1875 in which he first mentions the pronucleus by studying the eggs of rabbits and bats. He stated that the two pronuclei form together in the center of the cell to form the embryonic nucleus. Van Beneden also found that the sperm enters into the cell through the membrane in order to form the male pronucleus. In 1876, Oscar Hertwig did a study on sea urchin eggs because the eggs of sea urchins are transparent, so it allowed for much better magnification of the egg. Hertwig confirmed Van Beneden's finding of the pronucleus, and also found the formation of the female pronucleus involves the formation of polar bodies.HAMOIR, GABRIEL. ‚ÄúThe Discovery of Meiosis by E. Van Beneden, a Breakthrough in the Morphological Phase of Heredity.‚Äù Int. J. Dev. Biol., vol. 36, 1992, pp. 9‚Äì15. Formation The female pronucleus is the female egg cell once it has become a haploid cell, and the male pronucleus forms when the sperm enters into the female egg. While the sperm develops inside of the male testes, the sperm does not become a pronucleus until it decondenses quickly inside of the female egg.Gilbert SF. Developmental Biology. 6th edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2000. Fusion of the Genetic Material. When the sperm reaches the female egg, the sperm loses its outside membrane as well as its tail. The sperm does this because the membrane and the tail are no longer needed by the female ovum. The purpose of the cell membrane was to protect the DNA from the acidic vaginal fluid, and the purpose of the tail of the sperm was to help move the sperm cell to the egg cell. The formation of the female egg is asymmetrical, while the formation of the male sperm is symmetrical. Typically in a female mammal, meiosis starts with one diploid cell and becomes one haploid ovum and typically two polar bodies, however one may later divide to form a third polar body. In a male, meiosis starts with one diploid cell and ends with four sperm.Root Gorelick. ‚ÄúMeiosis Is Not Gender Neutral.‚Äù BioScience, vol. 62, no. 7, 2012, pp. 623‚Äì624. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/bio.2012.62.7.2. In mammals, the female pronucleus starts in the center of the egg before fertilization. When the male pronucleus is formed, after the sperm cell reaches the egg, the two pronuclei migrate towards each other. However, in brown alga Pelvetia, the egg pronucleus starts in the center of the egg before fertilization and remain in the center after fertilization. This is because the egg cells of brown alga Pelvetia, the egg pronucleus is anchored down by microtubules so only the male pronucleus migrates towards the female pronucleus.Swope, Richard E., and Darryl L. Kropf. ‚ÄúPronuclear Positioning and Migration during Fertilization in Pelvetia.‚Äù Developmental Biology, vol. 157, no. 1, 1993, pp. 269‚Äì276., doi:10.1006/dbio.1993.1131. =Calcium Concentration= The calcium concentration within the egg cell cytoplasm has a very important role in the formation of an activated female egg. If there is no calcium influx, the female diploid cell will produce three pronuclei, rather than only one. This is due to the failure of release of the second polar body.Miao, Yi-Liang, et al. ‚ÄúCalcium Influx-Mediated Signaling Is Required for Complete Mouse Egg Activation.‚Äù Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 109, no. 11, 2012, pp. 4169‚Äì4174. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/41507114. Combination of Male and Female Pronuclei The formation of the zygote starts with the fusion of both the inner and outer nuclei of the male and female pronuclei. It is unknown if one of the pronuclei start the combination of the two, or if the microtubules that help the dissolution of membranes commence the action.Longo, Frank J., and Everett Anderson. ‚ÄúThe Fine Structure of Pronuclear Development and Fusion in the Sea Urchin, Arbacia Punctulata.‚Äù The Journal of Cell Biology, vol. 39, no. 2, 1968, pp. 339‚Äì368. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1605485. The microtubules that make the two pronuclei combine come from the sperm‚Äôs centrosome. There is a study that strongly supports that microtubules are an important part of the fusion of the pronuclei. Vinblastine is a chemotherapy drug that affects both the plus and minus ends of microtubules.Panda, Dulal, et al. ‚ÄúDifferential Effects of Vinblastine on Polymerization and Dynamics at Opposite Microtubule Ends.‚Äù Journal of Biological Chemistry, vol. 271, no. 47, 1996, pp. 29807‚Äì29812., doi:10.1074/jbc.271.47.29807. When Vinblastine is added to the ovum, there is a high rate of pronuclear fusion failure. This high rate of pronuclear fusion failure highly suggests that microtubules play a major role in the fusion of the pronucleus.Hamilton, E P et al. ‚ÄúPronuclear fusion failure: an alternate conjugational pathway in Tetrahymena thermophila, induced by vinblastine.‚Äù Genetics vol. 118,4 (1988): 627-36. In mammals, the pronuclei only last in the cell for about twelve hours, due to the fusion of the genetic material of the two pronuclei within the egg cell. Many studies of pronuclei have been in the egg cells of sea urchins, where the pronuclei are in the egg cell for less than an hour. The main difference between the process of fusion of genetic materials in mammals versus sea urchins is that in sea urchins, the pronuclei go directly into forming a zygote nucleus.

Sent to England by Pope Julius II, he became Latin secretary to Henry VII of England and a prebendary of Salisbury. Born into one of the oldest families in Lucca (de Herena, also known as \\"della Rena\\"), he was later given the hellenized name \\"Ammonio\\". At the University of Bologna, he studied under Oliverius Jontus of Montegallorum, a teacher there from 1494 to 1498. Ammonio then went to Rome. By 1506, he was in England, probably travelling with Silvestro Gigli, another Luccanese, who had been sent by Pope Julius II in 1505 to give gifts to Henry VII and who became bishop of Worcester. In 1509 he became Latin secretary to William Blount, Lord Mountjoy, and by 1511 he was secretary to Henry VIII. That year, in Paris, Erasmus showed Blount the manuscript of a book of Ammonio's poems dedicated to Blount, who thought the dedication was too excessive and asked that it be changed. That was done, and Erasmus soon had the book printed.Deutscher, Thomas B., \\"Andrea Ammonio of Luca\\", article in Bietenholz, Peter G. and Thomas B.

Also in 1512, he was with the English expeditionary force in France when it won the Battle of the Spurs. On April 12, 1514, he became an English citizen, and in 1515 Pope Leo X appointed him subcollector of papal taxes in England, after Ammonio had conspired against Polydore Vergil for the post. Not yet 40 years old, Ammonio died suddenly in 1517 of the \\"sweating sickness\\" in London. The complete poems of Ammonio were published by Clemente Pizzi in 1958. Friend of Erasmus Ammonio met Erasmus when the latter visited England in 1506-1507, and they renewed their friendship from 1509-1511 after Erasmus returned from a trip to Italy. At some point they stayed together at the home of Thomas More. From 1511 to 1517 they exchanged more than 40 letters on many topics, ranging from the poor wine at Cambridge to international affairs. Ammonio helped Erasmus in his struggles to get papal permission to be free from some of the restrictions of his religious order and to gain financial security. On April 9, 1517, in the presence of Johannes Sixtinus at St. Stephen's in Westminster, and on behalf of Pope Leo X, Ammonio absolved Erasmus of all censures caused by not wearing the habit of his order. On August 19 of that year, Thomas More wrote to Erasmus, informing him of Ammonio's death.

Many are red coloured and are known as red bugs and some species are called cotton stainers because their feeding activities leave an indelible yellow- brownish stain on cotton crops. A common species in parts of Europe is the firebug, and its genus name Pyrrhocoris and the family name are derived from the Greek roots for fire \\"pyrrho-\\" and bug \\"coris\\". Members of this family are often confused with, but can be quickly separated from, Lygaeidae by the lack of ocelli (simple eyes) on the top of the head. Description The membrane of the forewing has one or two cells from which about 7-8 branching veins emerge that may have branches that fuse together (anastomose) while the main veins reach the margins of the wing. They have three tarsal segments. They can be very difficult to separate from some members of the family Largidae, which also share some of these characters and belong to the same super family. Largids tend to have the edge of the pronotum (the top of the first thoracic segment) rounded but the taxonomic feature for separating them is the found only in females; female largids have the sixth visible (actually the seventh) abdominal segment appearing to be split in the middle whereas female pyrrhocorids have this undivided. A few bugs in the family Rhopalidae have similar colors (e.g., Corizus hyoscyami) but they have ocelli, as do lygaeids. The scutellum is small and triangular. The antennae are made up of four segments with the second segment longer than the third. The beak-like mouthpart or rostrum has four segments and tip reaches at least the base of the middle pair of legs. Some species have the wing reduced so that the abdomen is visible from above. More detailed distinguishing features that are usually visible only under a microscope include a much reduced scent gland opening on the mid-thoracic segment. There are three sensory hairs or trichobothria on the abdominal segments 3 to 6 and two such hairs on the seventh segment. The genus Myrmoplasta is found in the African and Oriental regions and is somewhat unusual in having highly reduced wings and appearing ant-like or myrmecomorphic. Males and females differ in their foreleg morphology, but such sexual dimorphism is also found in a few other genera. Food Most species feed on seeds or fruits particularly of plants belonging to the Malvales but a few feed on rotting debris including dead animal matter. A few species are predatory; Raxa nishidai is a predator of another pyrrhocorid, Melamphaus faber, while Antilochus coquebertii feeds on other bugs including Dysdercus cingulatus. A few are important crop pests. One species, Dysdercus suturellus, is well known in the southern cotton growing regions of the United States while Dysdercus cingulatus occurs on cotton in tropical Asia. They damage cotton bolls by staining as well as by cutting the fibres. Dysdercus cingulatus, India Dindymus rubiginosus, East Asia Genera There are numerous genera within the family and these include: * Abulfeda * Aderrhis * Aeschines * Antilochus * Armatillus * Callibaphus * Courtesius * Cenaeus * Delecampius * Dermatinus * Dindymus * Dynamenais * Dysdercus * Ectatops * Euscopus * Froeschnerocoris * Gromierus * Indra * Jourdainana * Leptophthalmus * Melamphaus * Myrmoplasta * Neodindymus * Neoindra * Probergrothius (Odontopus is preoccupied) * Pyrrhocoris * Pyrrhopeplus * Raxa * Roscius * Saldoides * Scantius * Schmitziana * Sericocoris * Siango * Sicnatus * Stictaulax * Syncrotus References External links * Dysdercus suturellus, cotton stainer on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures Web site Heteroptera families ","title":"Pyrrhocoridae"},{"id":"1795269","text":"Amomum is a genus of plants native to China, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Queensland.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesFlora of China v 24 p 347, Ë±ÜËîªÂ±û dou kou shu, Amomum Roxburgh, Pl.

This can often happen in microsatellite regions due to the DNA polymerase slipping. Insertions can be anywhere in size from one base pair incorrectly inserted into a DNA sequence to a section of one chromosome inserted into another. The mechanism of the smallest single base insertion mutations is believed to be through base-pair separation between the template and primer strands followed by non-neighbor base stacking, which can occur locally within the DNA polymerase active site. On a chromosome level, an insertion refers to the insertion of a larger sequence into a chromosome. This can happen due to unequal crossover during meiosis. N region addition is the addition of non-coded nucleotides during recombination by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. P nucleotide insertion is the insertion of palindromic sequences encoded by the ends of the recombining gene segments. Trinucleotide repeats are classified as insertion mutations ] Understanding Evolution For Teachers Home. Retrieved on September 19, 2009 and sometimes as a separate class of mutations. Effects Insertions can be particularly hazardous if they occur in an exon, the amino acid coding region of a gene. A frameshift mutation, an alteration in the normal reading frame of a gene, results if the number of inserted nucleotides is not divisible by three, i.e., the number of nucleotides per codon. Frameshift mutations will alter all the amino acids encoded by the gene following the mutation. Usually, insertions and the subsequent frameshift mutation will cause the active translation of the gene to encounter a premature stop codon, resulting in an end to translation and the production of a truncated protein. Transcripts carrying the frameshift mutation may also be degraded through Nonsense- mediated decay during translation, thus not resulting in any protein product. If translated, the truncated proteins frequently are unable to function properly or at all and can possibly result in any number of genetic disorders depending on the gene in which the insertion occurs. Methods to detect DNA sequencing errors were developed. In-frame insertions occur when the reading frame is not altered as a result of the insertion; the number of inserted nucleotides is divisible by three. The reading frame remains intact after the insertion and translation will most likely run to completion if the inserted nucleotides do not code for a stop codon. However, because of the inserted nucleotides, the finished protein will contain, depending on the size of the insertion, multiple new amino acids that may affect the function of the protein.

He is best known for calculations involving the eponymous 19-year Metonic cycle which he introduced in 432 BC into the lunisolar Attic calendar. Euphronios says that Colonus was Meton's deme.Suda Encyclopedia, ¬ßmu.801 Work The metonic calendar incorporates knowledge that 19 solar years and 235 lunar months are very nearly of the same duration. Consequently, a given day of a lunar month will often occur on the same day of the solar year as it did 19 years previously. Meton's observations were made in collaboration with Euctemon, about whom nothing else is known. The Greek astronomer Callippus expanded on the work of Meton, proposing what is now called the Callippic cycle. A Callippic cycle runs for 76 years, or four Metonic cycles. Callippus refined the lunisolar calendar, deducting one day from the fourth Metonic cycle in each Callippic cycle (i.e., after 940 synodic lunar periods had elapsed), so as to better keep the lunisolar calendar synchronized with the seasons of the solar year. The world's oldest known astronomical calculator, the Antikythera Mechanism (2nd century BC), performs calculations based on both the Metonic and Callipic calendar cycles, with separate dials for each. The foundations of Meton's observatory in Athens are still visible just behind the podium of the Pnyx, the ancient parliament. Meton found the dates of equinoxes and solstices by observing sunrise from his observatory. From that point of observation, during the summer solstice, sunrise was in line with the local hill of Mount Lycabetus, while six months later, during the winter solstice, sunrise occurs over the high brow of Mount Hymettos in the southeast. So from Meton's observatory the Sun appears to move along a 60¬∞ arc between these two points on the horizon every six months. The bisector of the observatory's solstitial arc lies in line with the Acropolis. These topological features are important because the summer solstice was the point in time from which the Athenians measured the start of their calendar years. The first month of the new year, Hekatombaion, began with the first new moon after the summer solstice.Hannah, R. 'Greek and Roman Calendars'. London: Duckworth, pages 52-55. Meton appears briefly as a character in Aristophanes' play The Birds (414 BC). He comes on stage carrying surveying instruments and is described as a geometer. What little is known about Meton is related by ancient historians. According to Ptolemy, a stela or table erected in Athens contained a record of Meton's observations, and a description of the Metonic cycle.Smith, W. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biology and Mythology. Little and Brown, 1867, p. 1069 None of Meton's works survive.  Notes   References  * Toomer, G.

It was scripted by Clement and Ian La Frenais. Plot  The story is set in the fictional Caribbean island and British colony of Cascara. Widely ignored by the British Government, media, and general public, local Governor Baxter Thwaites is having an easy life in his small and peaceful colony. That peace is disturbed when an abandoned oil rig starts delivering water - at the standard of the finest table water brands (and laxative companies, as it contains a substance that makes you \\"shit like clockwork\\"). Different parties, including Downing Street, the Cascara Liberation Front, the White House, French bottled water producers, and Cuban guerrillas take interest in the future of the island and threaten to destroy the cosy way of life enjoyed by the island's inhabitants. The plot spoofs some elements of the comedies Carlton-Browne of the F.O. (1958) and Passport to Pimlico (1948) and the then-recent invasions of the Falkland Islands and Grenada. The film stars Caine as Baxter Thwaites, a Governor who has 'gone native' (similarly to his role in The Honorary Consul), and Billy Connolly as local biracial activist Delgado, supported by the last performance of Leonard Rossiter, as Sir Malcolm Leveridge, and one of the last performances of Fulton Mackay. Cast * Michael Caine as Governor Baxter Thwaites * Valerie Perrine as Pamela Weintraub * Brenda Vaccaro as Dolores Thwaites * Leonard Rossiter as Sir Malcolm Leveridge (final film appearance, released posthumously) * Billy Connolly as Delgado Fitzhugh * Chris Tummings as Garfield Cooper * Dennis Dugan as Rob Waring * Fulton Mackay as Reverend Eric McNab * Jimmie Walker as Jay Jay * Dick Shawn as Deke Halliday * Fred Gwynne as Franklin Spender * Trevor Laird as Pepito * Alan Igbon as Cuban * Maureen Lipman as Margaret Thatcher *Alfred Molina as Pierre *Bill Persky as TV director *Ruby Wax as Spenco Executive Cascara The film is largely set on the fictional island of Cascara. The actual filming location was the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. In the film an oil well is re-opened and discovered to have mineral water with a 'slight laxative effect'. The island's name itself is a play on this as Cascara is the name of a plant (scientific name Rhamnus purshiana) which has laxative properties. Production The film was one of three movies that HandMade Films intended to shoot in 1984, the others being A Private Function and a comedy from John MacKenzie, The Travelling Man (which ultimately would not be made). It was written by the experienced comedy duo Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, who had just made Bullshot (1983) for HandMade.Sellers p 143 Le Frenais and Clement had made a television pilot in the USA with Bill Persky who came up with the idea of a fictional British colony in the Caribbean which sought independence. The three of them wrote a screenplay which Persky wanted to direct (he had made the film Serial (1980)) but they were unable to raise finance. Then when Clement and Le Frenais made Bullshot for Handmade they showed the script to Dennis O'Brien, head of the studio. \\"It was Denis who absolutely loved the script and really responded to it and said, 'Let's do it',\\" said Clement.Sellers p 145 Clement and Le Frenais wrote another draft of the script and sent it to Michael Caine, who loved it and wanted to make the film. Clement says, \\"We were thrilled because we knew that meant we would get the film made, and suddenly it was a go project.\\" \\"I guess it was like an Ealing film,\\" said Clement, \\"but it was not a conscious effort to recreate that style. I can see the analogies with something like Passport to Pimlico.\\"Sellers p 165 Denis O'Brien liked to use members of Monty Python in HandMade films and offered the role of Sir Malcolm Leveridge to John Cleese. Cleese read the script and turned it down; Leonard Rossiter played the role instead, in what turned out to be Rossiter's last film.Sellers p 146 The movie started filming in May 1984. The same month A Private Function also went into production and people who worked on that film felt their budget was sacrificed in order to fund Water.Sellers p 154 Shooting took place mostly on Saint Lucia. There were few filmmaking facilities so items had to be shipped there by sea. Studio work was done at Shepperton Studios in London and the oil rig scenes were shot in Devon. At the time Billy Connolly was an emerging comedian, much admired by Denis O'Brien. \\"They were always trying to put him into a movie because Denis was convinced that Billy Connolly was the funniest man in Britain,\\" said Clement. \\"He was way ahead of the pack there.\\" O'Brien insisted that Connolly be in Bullshot and Water. \\"He was actually cast before anybody else,\\" said Clement.Sellers p 156 Billy Connolly later recalled the making of the movie. \\"We went to Heathrow to fly out, and fly out we did. Not knowing that - there were no mobile phones then of course - they were racing up to tell us not to go. That the money had fallen through. But by the time the plane landed in Saint Lucia, they'd got the money again!\\" The BBC television presenter Paul Heiney had a small part in the film as part of the In At The Deep End series. Dick Clement later said, \\"We were rewriting the ending as we went along and that's never good... In hindsight, I always think you need to get those decisions out of the way before you get on the set. But, on the whole, it was a good shoot. Michael Caine was a fantastic trouper on the film, he was really a joy to work with, enormously supportive. I can‚Äôt be more appreciative of his work on it and how professional he was. In a way, Michael had the straightest part in the film, he was almost the straight man. He kept saying to me, 'You realise I'm having to carry all the plot here?'\\"Sellers p 155 Connolly said Caine \\"taught me so much, about how to be generous to other actors. We were climbing up a hill and we were being filmed from the top. Suddenly he went, oh! My leg! And he spoiled a whole take. So they said we're doing it again, and he whispered to me 'next time, move further to the right, they can't see you'. He was lovely.\\" George Harrison normally did not get too involved in production of HandMade's films. However he helped out on Water by appearing in the concert at the end and getting his friends Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr to appear. \\"George was very leery of appearing in his own company's movies,\\" says Clement, \\"that was a big help to the film. We called in a few favours and, obviously, the Harrison connection didn't hurt. We hoped that scene would be a big selling tool for the movie... didn't work out that way but it was a good idea.\\"Sellers p 157 The concert scene was shot in a single day at Shepperton Studios. Clapton, Starr and Harrison were paid the musician's minimum rate for a playback session on set.Sellers p 158 Soundtrack The soundtrack principally featured reggae music by Eddy Grant and was released by Ariston Records. The Singing Rebel's Band consists of Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Ray Cooper, Jon Lord, Mike Moran, Chris Stainton and Ringo Starr, with backing singers Jenny Bogle and Anastasia Rodriguez.full cast list at IMDB It spoofs The Concert for Bangladesh organised by Harrison in 1971.  Reception  The film was released in London in January 1985. It was briefly in the top ten box office listing - along with A Private Function - but soon dropped out. It failed to recoup its costs and could not find an American distributor. When it was released there in April 1986 it failed at the box office there too. =Critical= The film received a mixed review in the New York Times, which read in part \\"The folks who packaged this put-on operated on the theory that a lot of eccentric people doing nutty things produce hilarity. The ingredient missing from the fitfully amusing conglomeration of characters is a character for the whole. In kidding everything, the movie leaves us uncertain about whether anything is being seriously kidded.\\"\\"Michael Caine in Water\\", Walter Goodman, New York Times, 18 April 1986 The Los Angeles Times called it \\"so refreshingly funny that you're tempted to forgive its tendency to run dry in its last half hour... boasts some of the wittiest lines heard on screen since A Private Function.\\" Dick Clement later reflected: > I'm happier with Bullshot than I am with Water. I think Water just misses. I > feel it's not quite connecting in the right way. I look back on it and I'm > fairly uncomfortable. For me I always did have a problem with fictional > countries or places, I always like things rooted a little bit more in > reality.

And again in > hindsight as much as I love Billy Connolly I think a black guy in that part > would have been better. I think that would've helped the credibility of > making it a Caribbean island.Sellers p 164-165 Michael Palin later said the financial failure of the film \\"was a bit of a turning point in HandMade Films, that Water was such a disaster and yet so much money was put into it. Somehow the luck ran out because judgement up to that time had been pretty good.\\" =DVD= Water was first released on home video by Paramount Home Video on 1 February 1987. The film received its first DVD edition in North America in 2006, courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment.

Born in Bucharest, Romania, she was known largely for the work she made in Brazil, then Mexico for many years and later in Italy, Israel and The Netherlands.http://www.henriquefaria.com/exhibition-about?id=133 History Landau was born on December 5, 1926 in Bucharest, Romania. At the age of 12, her Jewish family, fearing persecution by rising fascist forces, fled Romania just ahead of Ion Antonescu's coup d'√©tat. After extensive travel throughout Europe, she finally arrived in Brazil. There, her great interest in artistic and intellectual life gave her the opportunity to meet painters like Di Cavalcanti, Antonio Dias, Wesley Duke Lee, Francisco Brennand, Antonio Dias and Jo√£o Camara, the sculptor Sergio Camargo, the writer Jorge Amado and poet- musician-diplomat Vinicius de Morais, the musician-painter Dorival Caymmi. Shy but determined, she started to paint. Her first works were figurative but gradually she began to realize that this was not her style. Influenced by Dufy, she painted her way out of figurative art and entered into Expressionism. A very decisive moment in her life was when her uncle Marcel Janco (one of the founders of Dadaism) came to visit her family and was very impressed by her work. Another important artist in her career was the great Brazilian engraver Oswaldo Goeldi. Critics, like Mario Pedrosa, Aracy Amaral, Frederico de Morais (Brazil), Jorge A. Manrique (who described her work as being \\"brutal and refined‚Äô)UniVerso: El Peri√≥dico de los Universitarios - No. 22\\" and Rita Eder have recognized Landau's artistic contribution, describing it with high esteem. Landau has lived in six countries, whose diverse cultures gave her work a cosmopolitan outlook. She married Miguel Salas Anzures, head of Fine Arts-INBA, Mexico. He broke with Socialist Realism, represented by painters like Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros. This new expression of art was called Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura. The members of this generation of artists include native-born Mexicans and immigrants, many of whom were refugees from World War II. Along with Jos√© Luis Cuevas, these include Fernando Garc√≠a Ponce, Roger Von Gunten, Edmundo Aquino, Francisco Toledo, Arturo Rivera, Leonora Carrington, Alberto Gironella, Ricardo Mart√≠nez, Arnaldo Coen, Lilia Carrillo, Vlady, Manuel Felgu√©rez, Gilberto Aceves Navarro, Gustavo Arias Murueta, Luis L√≥pez Loza, Luis Almeida, Peggy Espinosa, Adolfo Falc√≥n, Efra√≠n Herrero, Rafael L√≥pez Castro, Bernardo Recamier, Pablo Rulfo and Vicente Rojo. Landau introduced a new technique of engraving on metal, utilizing acids, but printed from the surface, called Metal Relief. She had her first exhibition in Mexico in 1963 and gradually became one of the leading Latin American women artists.Latin American Women Artists, Kahlo and Look Who Else, Cecilia Puerto, 1996, Her Metal Relief works were well received by art critic Paul Westheim in the important magazine El Nuevo Arte de los Metales and by art connoisseur, reviewer and historian Jorge Olvera. She continued her in-depth research and found her definitive expression in painting with pastel on raw linen. In this technique she was a pioneer. Her thematic approach was also new: she was the first Latin American abstract painter to use movements of free geometrical lines. All her works since 1965 are called Rhythms. In 1974, she began working as a teacher in the University of Veracruz in the Faculty of Fine Arts. In 1975 she became a full- time researcher for the Institute of Aesthetics and Artistic Creation at the University. Landau had more than sixty individual exhibitions, the most important of which was held in 1987 in the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City. She participated in 150 group exhibitions in Mexico, France, Italy, Brazil, Chile, the United States and Cuba. In 1994, she moved from Mexico to Rome,Italy where she stayed until 2010 and later to Jerusalem, Israel where she lived for 6 years.

The complex merged neighboring studios United Recording Corp. on 6050 Sunset Boulevard and Western Studio on 6000 Sunset Boulevard. In 1984, United Western Recorders was renamed and succeeded by Ocean Way Recording. Starting in 1999, the complex was divided into two establishments: Ocean Way Recording (now United Recording Studios) at 6050 Sunset and Cello Studios (now EastWest Studios) at 6000 Sunset. The United Western complex produced some of the biggest hit records of the pop era. According to the book Temples of Sound, \\"No other studio has won more technical excellence awards, and no studio has garnered as many Best Engineered Grammys as this complex of studios on Sunset Boulevard.\\" Its Studio 3 room is considered iconic for its use by Brian Wilson for the Beach Boys' albums Pet Sounds (1966) and Smile (unreleased). Structure 6000 Sunset Boulevard in 2019, the former site of Western Studio The complex's two buildings, United Recording and Western Studio, operated more or less independently despite being located only one block apart. United consisted of two large rooms; the larger United 'A' was approximately 45 √ó 65 √ó 22 feet, with United 'B' being slightly smaller. Western copied the layout of United, with the very large Western 1 and the somewhat smaller Western 2. Both buildings also had a third, smaller recording room, as well as several dubbing and mastering suites. The small rooms provided a sumptuous sound, with Western Studio 3, measuring just 34' √ó 14', being Brian Wilson's preference.https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2004/06/western-studios- hollywood-1966.htmlTemples of Sound - Inside the Great Recording Studios By Jim Cogan and William Clark History =Active years (1961‚Äì84)= Prior to his move to California, Bill Putnam had founded the prestigious Universal Recording studio in Chicago. A pioneer of modern recording technique, Putnam became well known for his UREI recording equipment and custom-made Universal Audio mixing consoles, which were bought by major recording studios. After relocating to Hollywood in 1957, and with the backing of Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, Putnam first established the United Recording Corp. studio complex at 6050 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. In 1961, he purchased the neighboring Western Studio at 6000 Sunset, remodeling and incorporating the building into the complex. The buildings were then renamed United Western Recorders, and catered to some of the biggest artists of the era, including Frank Sinatra, The Beach Boys, and Elvis Presley.Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special Putnam assembled a talented staff, some of whom went on to become major names in their own right, notably Bones Howe, John Haeny, Lee Hershberg, Chuck Britz, and Wally Heider, one of the pioneers of mobile recording and later of Wally Heider Studios. United was initially favored by 'older' artists such as Crosby, Sinatra, Nat King Cole and Ray Charles, as well as the young Fleetwoods, while Western soon became a favored recording venue for the new generation of pop-rock musicians and producers, such as Sam Cooke, the Beach Boys, Phil Spector and The Mamas & the Papas. In the early sixties, Putnam scored a significant coup when major US record labels began to release stereophonic recordings in large numbers. According to Allen Sides, when stereo first appeared in the late 1950s, the cost-conscious major labels were initially uninterested, feeling that the market for the new format was limited, and that stereo mixdowns were a waste of time and money. Putnam however foresaw the coming importance of stereo and, at his own expense, he began making simultaneous mono and stereo mixdowns, storing away the stereo versions of these recordings, which at the time were released only in mono. When stereo took off in the early sixties, Putnam had amassed a very valuable stockpile of more than two-and-a-half years' worth of stereo recordings by scores of major acts. The value of this stockpile can be estimated from Sides' statement that United Western was at this time bringing in around US$200,000 per month in studio billings‚Äîequivalent to perhaps US$1 million per month today. The major labels approached Putnam hoping to buy the stereo tape stockpile, but he struck a far more lucrative deal, in which the labels repaid him for the (far more expensive) studio time he had used in making the stereo mixes. In 1970, Jack Herschorn purchased the Universal Audio mixing console and a number of other pieces of equipment from that studio including UA LA-76A and LA-76B limiting amplifiers, UA vacuum tube power amplifiers (which were actually Dynakit Stereo 70 and 50-watt mono amplifier kits assembled into rack-mount chassis), Fairchild Conax sibilance controllers, Langevin graphic equalizers and Cinema Engineering filters, all originally installed in United Studio A in 1957. This equipment was shipped to Vancouver, Canada, and installed in Aragon Studios which he owned at the time, later renamed Mushroom Studios. Installation of the equipment in Vancouver was supervised by Charlie Richmond. =Management changes= Ocean Way Recording In 1984, Bill Putnam sold the studio complex to Allen Sides, who renamed the buildings Ocean Way Recording, as they would both be known until 1999. Cello Studios In 1999, Sides sold the Western half of the complex to computer magnate Rick Adams, who renamed it Cello Studios. Cello Studios operated at the 6000 Sunset complex from 1999-2005. During that period, the studios hosted high-profile rock artists such as Blink-182, Rage Against the Machine, Tool, System of a Down, Weezer, Muse, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Audioslave, and The Mars Volta. Cello Studios closed in 2005. When Allen Sides sold Western to Rick Adams, the equipment inventory was also purchased from Ocean Way Recording, including a collection of rare vintage microphones, as well as vintage outboard gear including valuable studio effects units such as the legendary Fairchild 670 limiters, no longer made, which were a crucial element of the sound of many classic pop recordings of the Fifties and Sixties. While the building was modified to accommodate the new facility's needs, the studios themselves have not been altered since Bill Putnam's original design. During this period, the studio played host to artists such as Alanis Morissette, Natalie Merchant, Elton John, R.E.M., Bette Midler, Barenaked Ladies, Stone Temple Pilots, Matthew Sweet, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Green Day and Blink-182. EastWest Studios At the beginning of 2006, Cello Studios (originally Western) was purchased by EastWest producer Doug Rogers and renamed EastWest Studios. Rogers extensively remodeled the non-technical areas of the studio complex with designer Philippe Starck, but the studios themselves, with their famous acoustics, remain as originally built by Putnam in the 1960s and continue to operate to this day. Since 2012 EastWest Studios has racked up 130 Grammy nominations, more than any other recording studio in the world. United Recording Studios In 2015, Ocean Way Recording was sold and renamed back to United Recording Studios.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Rak√≥w. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,213. Rak√≥w was founded in 1569 by , a Calvinist who was castellan of ≈ªarn√≥w, as the centre of the Polish Brethren and a place of religious tolerance. The town coat of arms includes a crayfish and is derived from the Warnia coat of arms of Sienie≈Ñski's Arian wife, Jadwiga Gnoi≈Ñska. The Socinian Racovian Academy was founded in 1602 by Jakub Sienie≈Ñski, Jan Sienie≈Ñski's son. By the 1630s, the town had grown to 15,000 inhabitants, with businesses centering on the Academy. As the Counter-Reformation in Poland gathered force, pressure began to be used against the Socinians. On April 19, 1638 an incident occurred in which some young students of the Academy destroyed or removed a cross, giving the royal court the pretext needed to ban Arian activities, including printing and the schools, and sentenced teachers to exile, many heading south to the Principality of Transylvania. Jesuit scholar Szymon Starowolski justified the closing of Protestant schools (in 1638 and 1640), and Protestant centers and printing presses (in 1638, the press at Rak√≥w), as the \\"duty of good pastors\\" and as a legitimate act of the King and the Republic.

In 1641 Jakub Zadzik, archbishop of Krak√≥w, began construction of the magnificent on the same site and settled Franciscan friars in Rak√≥w to reconvert the Polish Brethren. The friars left the town around 1649. The main Arian buildings were destroyed, and more destruction was brought by Cossacks and Hungarians in 1657. By 1700 the town had only 700 inhabitants left. Initially, after the first partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Rak√≥w was in the Austrian Partition and later in the Russian Partition. In 1820, Rak√≥w had 926 inhabitants, in 1864 their number rose to 2007, a significant part being Jewish. In 1869, like many other Polish towns, Rak√≥w lost its town status and town privileges.

It was written by Stephen Gallagher and was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 3 to 24 January 1981. The serial is set at an intersection between the universe of E-Space and the home universe of the alien time traveller the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker). In the serial, the Doctor and his travelling companion Romana (Lalla Ward) seek to free the time-sensitive Tharils from a group of slavers led by Captain Rorvik (Clifford Rose). Warriors' Gate is the last of three loosely connected serials set in E-Space. It is the last serial to feature Ward as Romana and the last regular appearance of John Leeson as the voice of K9. Plot Inside the TARDIS, the Fourth Doctor, Romana, Adric, and K9, while travelling between E-Space and the normal universe (N-Space), become trapped in a white null space between the universes. Elsewhere in the void, a slave vessel, run by Captain Rorvik, has also become trapped. It uses members of the leonine Tharil race as their navigators. On becoming stuck, the current navigator, Biroc, escapes the ship and makes his way to the TARDIS on the winds of time. Biroc warns the TARDIS crew of Rorvik's treachery before disappearing. K9's memory wafers are shredded by the winds of time, leaving him functional but lacking long-term memories. The Doctor leaves on his own to explore the null space. He encounters some robots, called Gundans. Meanwhile, Rorvik and his crew have discovered TARDIS. Romana leaves to talk to them. Rorvik, believing Romana to be time-sensitive like the Tharils, dupes her into returning to their ship to examine the engines. When Romana does not return, Adric and K9 leave to recover her, but get separated; Adric eventually makes it to the ship and hides aboard, while K9 reunites with the Doctor and aids in repairing the Gundan, after which he learns from it that they were built by slaves and used to overthrow their masters in a violent battle. The Doctor's work is disrupted when Rorvik and several of his men arrive. During a stand-off between the crew and the Doctor, another Gundan activates and walks through the seemingly-solid mirror. Rorvik demands an explanation from the Doctor, revealing he has Romana captive, but the Doctor's only response is to walk through the mirror himself. Aboard the slaver ship, Romana is freed by another Tharil named Lazlo, and she hides in the hull. She encounters Adric; the two work out that the ship is made from an incredibly dense dwarf star alloy that can contain the Tharils. K9 arrives, and informs the two of dimensional instability in the null space, which they attribute to the alloy, causing the space to collapse in on itself. Romana rejoins Lazlo, and takes her to the gateway and through the mirror, while Adric remains aboard the ship. On the other side of the mirror, the Doctor and Romana are reunited with Biroc in a stable, time-locked universe. A repentant Biroc explains they were the slave masters, travelling on the winds of time in order to ravage other planets and subjugate their populations as slaves until the Gundan revolt. The Doctor and Romana are returned to the null space, and are immediately captured by Rorvik. Rorvik's crew realise that the null space is shrinking as the distances between the gateway, the TARDIS, and slaver ship continue to decrease. Rorvik has ordered the crew to try to blast through the mirrors in gateway, believing it to be the way out, but the mirrors resist all attacks. With the gateway and ship in visible distance of each other, Rorvik resorts to one last attempt to break the mirrors by using the exhaust of the ship's engines against them. While the Doctor warns that this action will be as doomed as the previous ones, Romana regroups with Lazlo and Adric, and together they free the remaining Tharils on the slaver ship. The TARDIS crew flee to the TARDIS as Rorvik initiates his plan‚Äîthe blast from the engines is reflected by the mirrors back onto the ship, destroying it and its crew. As the saved Tharils pass through the mirror, Romana announces that she will be staying with them, having become empathetic to their plight and not wanting to return to Gallifrey. The Doctor gives her K9, as passing through the mirror will restore his memory but he will be unable to return. The Tharils, in exchange, provide the Doctor with information on how to leave the void back to N-Space. Production Originally, the fifth story of season 18 was Sealed Orders by novelist Christopher Priest before being abandoned. Stephen Gallagher, who had written a number of radio plays, was called upon for a replacement, resulting in Warriors' Gate. Commissioned in March 1980, this was Gallagher's first script for Doctor Who and had the working title Dream Time. The story was influenced by a radio serial he had done in 1979 called \\"The Babylon Run\\" as well as the films of Jean Cocteau, such as Orph√©e (1950), in which mirrors provide a gateway into another world.Warriors' Gate BBC DVD liner notes, 2009 On completion in June, script editor Christopher H. Bidmead found the scripts to be overlong, as well as needing more work to keep them in line with other stories in the series. Therefore, he and director Paul Joyce re-worked the story significantly, including re-writing much of the dialogue. Originally, the script was much more comedic, with Rorvik's crew being given a lot of humorous dialogue, two of the workers being played as a double-act. Executive producer Barry Letts in particular was against this, saying that it was turning the show into pantomime and stated that the crewmen must be played for real. As many of these lines were cut from the script, the few remaining \\"comedy\\" lines were to be played straight as well. The scripts were finalised in late August 1980, but were then criticised by Letts, who found them rather confusing. By this time however, there was no more time to rework them further as Bidmead needed to begin work on the following story. Producer John Nathan-Turner too found the story complicated but had not got involved with the story during its scripting stages. Bidmead met with Gallagher with the revised scripts, the latter being none too happy with the extensive changes. Warriors' Gate was significant in that it was the last story to feature companion Romana played by Lalla Ward as well as the last regular appearance of John Leeson as long-running companion K9. Ward had requested to leave earlier, having been offered a part in another series, but Nathan-Turner kept her to her contract. It was also during the making of this serial that Tom Baker let it be known that he would leave at the end of the series. Ward and Baker were in a relationship and had been for some time, but by now things were turning acrimonious between the two, with many production personnel believing that they were on the point of splitting-up. It was with much surprise when they learned that just a few weeks later they had married. Leeson, who left the series at the end of Season 16, returned for Season 18 on the understanding that K9 would be written out toward the end of the season.\\"The Dreaming\\" documentary produced by Andrew Beech, The E-space Trilogy DVD box set (2009) 2 Entertain. Joyce was keen to push the limits of the series by directing the serial like a film as he considered some of the earlier productions to be quite bland and workmanlike.\\"The Dreaming\\", DVD Special documentary, 2009 This approach however caused problems early on with significant delays in order to achieve various shots such as the pan through the spaceship in the opening sequence. This included shooting the camera upwards where the gallery lights could be seen - known as \\"shooting off set\\", something which is forbidden by the BBC. Problems such as this increased as time began to run short and he and producer Nathan-Turner clashed frequently and even executive producer Letts had to step in to advise Joyce. With letters being written to higher executives complaining of Joyce's style of work (also seen as inexperience), Joyce was asked to leave part way through production. His duties were taken up by assistant Graeme Harper, who directed a number of scenes before finally Joyce was re-instated. Setting up of certain shots that Joyce had envisaged proved to take up too much time and shooting over-ran on a number of days. In the end, the serial was completed and was indeed a departure in terms of style over the norm and was complimented by Bidmead, but Joyce was never to work on Doctor Who again. Background photographs utilised in many sequences were taken at Powis Castle, Welshpool. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Stephen Gallagher under the pseudonym \\"John Lydecker\\", was published by Target Books in April 1982. It and Terminus (Gallagher's other novelisation of his own script under the John Lydecker byline) are the only two Target novels that consist of continuous prose with no chapters. The novelisation contains many elements abandoned during the story's production, including the slaver's opening pursuit and damage at the hands of an Antonine Killer craft. =Home media= Warriors' Gate was released on VHS as part of \\"The E-Space Trilogy\\" boxed set in November 1997. It was released on DVD in January 2009, again in a boxed set entitled \\"The E-Space Trilogy\\". This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files (issue 87) in May 2012.

Pliny ( 77‚Äì79) enumerated a group of tribes through which the Don River (Tanais) crossed, in which the Spalaei are last mentioned.Pliny, Natural History, 6.7. He mentioned the conquerors of the Napaei as the Palaei (6, 50), while in another chapter (6, 22) says that it was the three Scythian tribes of Auchetae, Athernei and Asampatae that defeated them. It is believed that the Spalaei and Palaei are one and the same. Diodorus (2, 43) reported that the Spalaei/Palaei/Pali were descendants of Scythian king Palus, the son of Scythes. The mythical origin and chapter '6, 22' suggests that the Spalaei/Palaei/Pali was a \\"collective designation of the eastern branch of Royal Scythians\\". By examinating Pliny and Diodorus, the Auchetae (or Euchatae) were part of the Spalaei/Palaei/Pali. Herodotus ( 440 BC) stated that the Scythians or Scoloti consisted of the Auchatae (descending from Lipoxais), Catiaroi and Traspies (from Arpoxais), and Paralatae (from Colaxais), the latter which was \\"the youngest of them, the royal race\\". Tadeusz Sulimirski believed that they were a branch of the Roxolani. Sulimirski attributed Sarmatian archaeology on the mid-Dnieper to the tribe, supported by the Sarmatians' downfall after the Gothic invasion in 200 AD. The \\"Royal Scythian\\" connection is supported by Indo-Parthian royal names Spalirisos, Spalyris, Spalahora, and the Slavic word ispolin, spolin (\\"giant\\"), assumed to date back to when Slavs were ruled by the Spalaei. Francis Dvornik (1893‚Äì1975) believed that the Sporoi mentioned by Procopius (500‚Äì560) as being the old name of the Antes and Sclaveni were probably the Spali mentioned by Jordanes ( 551) and Spalei mentioned by Pliny.

Kaufman. It was adapted from the hit Broadway play of the same name by Teichmann and Kaufman, in which they pillory big business and corrupt businessmen. The film stars Judy Holliday and Paul Douglas. The film is in black-and-white except for the very last scene, which is in Technicolor. Plot At a shareholders meeting for International Projects, a billion dollar corporation, John T. Blessington (John Williams) announces he is replacing Edward L. McKeever (Paul Douglas), the company's founder, president and chairman of the board, who is resigning to work for the federal government in Washington D.C. Laura Partridge (Judy Holliday), a minority stockholder with just ten shares of stock, drives its arrogant, self-serving executives to distraction with her incessant questioning during this and subsequent meetings. Blessington comes up with the idea of hiring the struggling actress as director of shareholder relations to keep her occupied answering letters from small shareholders. He assigns her a secretary, Amelia Shotgraven (Neva Patterson), with secret instructions to obstruct her as much as possible. The conscientious Miss Partridge, upon discovering there is nothing substantial for her to do, decides to write the stockholders herself. She gains Amelia's friendship and wholehearted assistance by helping her develop a romantic relationship with office manager Mark Jenkins (Arthur O'Connell). When the directors find out, they fire Amelia. However, Laura discovers that Blessington's thoroughly unqualified brother-in-law, Harry Harkness (Hiram Sherman), has driven an apparent competitor into bankruptcy, unaware International Projects actually owns the unfortunate company. With that as leverage, she gets Amelia rehired. Still determined to neutralize Laura, the board decides to send her to Washington to persuade McKeever to give them some government contracts. She agrees to go, with the secret intention of trying to convince him to return and take back control from his crooked cronies. However, the company directors recall that he has divested himself of all his shares and is thus powerless, so they brush him off. McKeever takes them to court, arguing that Laura was an unlicensed, illegal lobbyist; but, when she is forced to admit on the stand that she had another, romantic, reason for seeing him, the case is dropped. However, Laura has forged a warm relationship with many of the smaller investors while working at the company; they responded and sent in their proxies, giving her the right to vote their shares. Laura and McKeever use these votes to replace the entire board. They marry. As a gift to \\"The Girl Who Has Everything,\\" her husband presents her a single solid gold Cadillac for her birthday.

He concluded, \\"it will give you an entertaining ride, but don't expect it to take you or your intelligence very far.\\" The Film4 reviewer agreed that the story was not particularly convincing (\\"Yeah ‚Äì like global capitalism gets overthrown that easily\\"), but \\"even so, it's undemanding and amusing.\\" Awards and nominations Jean Louis won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design Black and White.

It currently broadcasts with country music programming, along with certain sporting events (Cleveland Indians baseball, local high school sports). The station is owned by V-Teck Communications, and is the sister station of WPKO 98.3 FM. History WBLL originally signed on the air in 1951 with the call letters WOHP (for \\"Ohio's Highest Point\\"). It was the first radio station licensed to Bellefontaine since station WHBD relocated to Mount Orab, Ohio in 1929 (later known as WPAY in Portsmouth, Ohio). In the late 1960s, the station's callsign changed to WTOO (for \\"Top Of Ohio\\"), in 1981 to WTCY (for \\"Top (of Ohio) CountrY\\"), and then switched back to the WOHP calls on February 14, 1983 with a gospel format. On February 19, 1988, the station became WPKO, in recognition of its sister station, WPKO-FM. The call letters became WBLL on May 12, 1989. Joe Rockhold was a disk jockey at WOHP in the 1950s where he launched his broadcasting career. Shortly before the decade was over he became a staff announcer (and eventually became best known as children's show host \\"Uncle Orrie\\")at Dayton's WHIO-TV where he remained until his retirement in 1969. Rockhold however remained active in broadcasting throughout his retirement at WSRW (AM) in Hillsboro, Ohio before his death in 1981. On January 28, 2004, V-Teck Communications applied for a construction permit for a transmitter in Grandview Heights, Ohio. This transmitter would be well within the Columbus metropolitan area. The FCC acknowledged the CP request on November 17, 2004, and further acknowledged an application for a major modification to a licensed facility on January 21, 2005. This may indicate plans by V-Teck to effectively move the station from Bellefontaine to the Grandview Heights-Columbus area. While the license location for the newest application is in Grandview Heights, the major modification request is for , placing the new transmitter (if built) near Grove City, Ohio. This is southwest of Columbus; Bellefontaine and the present transmitter are to the northwest of Columbus. For a brief time in the mid-1970s, WTOO set trends by breaking several songs before the major stations in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. This was under the management of Program and Music Director David Mark early in his career. Mark eventually became one of the country's major voice-over announcers and, beginning in the 1990s and well into the 2000s, was the promotional voice of Fox TV network stations and many UPN TV network stations across the country. The WOHP callsign was later used at an FM station in Portsmouth, Ohio as a repeater of the former WCDR \\"The Path\\" (now WKCD) in Cedarville, Ohio which is now WSGR, formerly part of the Contemporary Christian K-LOVE network. The WOHP callsign is now being used at a low-power FM station in Huntsville, Ohio. The WTCY callsign is now used by a Catholic FM station in Traverse City, Michigan.

The house is built of brick with a pitched Swithland slate roof and is listed as of local interest. There was no school in the village open to ordinary villagers until 1847. The earlier school, in a small building to the rear of No. 28, Main Street, was only for children whose parents worked on the Queniborough Hall estate. Nos 22‚Äì28, Main Street were built between 1790 and 1810 as workers' cottages. The schoolmaster lived at No. 28. The row is still occupied, and the old village school, part of No. 28, now serves as a dining room with a vaulted ceiling. The school built in 1847 stands beside the Horse and Groom pub. This was a free school from the outset, available to the children of all villagers. It is now used as a small swimming pool for the new primary school built in the 1970s. A junior school was built in Coppice Lane and opened in September 1954. =Notable people= *George Shingler (1882‚Äì1946), county cricketer, died in Queniborough.

It is a Grade II listed Georgian terraced house in Spitalfields in the East End, Central London, England. From 1979 to 1999 it was lived in by Dennis Severs, who gradually recreated the rooms as a time capsule in the style of former centuries. It is now open to the public. The motto of the house is Aut Visum Aut Non!: \\"You either see it or you don't.\\" The house The house is on the south side of Folgate Street and dates from approximately 1724. It is one of a terrace of houses (Nos 6-18) built of brown brick with red brick dressings, over four storeys and with a basement. The listing for the house, compiled in 1950, describes No 18 as having a painted facade, and that the first floor [window] frames are enriched with a trellis pattern. History Dennis Severs (16 November 1948, Escondido, California ‚Äì 27 December 1999, London) was drawn to London by what he called \\"English light\\", and made his home in the dilapidated property in Folgate Street in 1979. This area of the East End of London, next to Spitalfields Market, had become very run-down, and artists had started to move in. Bohemian visual artists Gilbert & George added to the flavour of the neighbourhood; resident there since the late 1960s, they also refurbished a similar house. Severs started on a programme to refurbish the ten rooms of the house, each in a different historic style, mainly from the 18th and 19th centuries. The rooms are arranged as if they are in use and the occupants have only just left. There are therefore displays of items such as half-eaten bread, and different smells and background sounds for each room. Severs called this \\"still life drama\\" and wrote: Woven through the house is the story of the fictional Jervis family (a name anglicised from Gervais), originally Huguenot (French Protestant immigrants) silk weavers who lived at the house from 1725 to 1919. Each room evokes incidental moments in the lives of these imaginary inhabitants. Writer Peter Ackroyd, author of London: the biography, wrote: Writer and illustrator Brian Selznick used the house as an inspiration for his 2015 novel The Marvels. The book concludes with a short history and photographs of Dennis Severs. Many of the characters names and story lines are similar to the museum. Jeanette Winterson, who also restored a derelict house nearby to live in, observed, \\"Fashions come and go, but there are permanencies, vulnerable but not forgotten, that Dennis sought to communicate\\".Severs, Dennis 18 Folgate Street: The Tale of a House in Spitalfields, 2002, Vintage Painter David Hockney described the house as one of the world's greatest works of opera. Severs bequeathed the house to the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust, an architectural preservation charity, shortly before his death. It is now open to the public, who are asked during their visit to respect the intent of the creator and participate in an imaginary journey to another time.

It was launched aboard an H-IIA 202 rocket on 20 May 2010, and failed to enter orbit around Venus on 6 December 2010. After the craft orbited the Sun for five years, engineers successfully placed it into an alternative Venusian elliptic orbit on 7 December 2015 by firing its attitude control thrusters for 20 minutes and made it the first Asian satellite orbiting Venus. By using five different cameras working at several wavelengths, Akatsuki is studying the stratification of the atmosphere, atmospheric dynamics, and cloud physics. Astronomers working on the mission reported detecting a possible gravity wave (not to be confused with gravitational waves) in Venus' atmosphere in December 2015.

Mission Akatsuki is a Japanese orbiter mission currently studying the planet Venus. Observations include cloud and surface imaging from an orbit around the planet with cameras operating in the infrared, visible and UV wavelengths to investigate the complex Venusian meteorology and elucidate the processes behind the mysterious atmospheric super-rotation. On Venus, while the planet rotates at 6 km/h at the equator, the atmosphere spins around the planet at 300 km/h. Other experiments are designed to confirm the presence of lightning and to determine whether volcanism occurs currently on Venus. Akatsuki is Japan's first planetary exploration mission since the failed Mars orbiter Nozomi probe which was launched in 1998. Akatsuki was originally intended to conduct scientific research for two or more years from an elliptical orbit around Venus ranging from in altitude, but its alternate orbit had to be highly elliptical ranging between 1,000 km and 10,000 km at its nearest point and about 360,000 km at its farthest. This larger orbit takes 10 days to complete instead of the originally planned 30 hours. The budget for this mission is ¬•14.6 billion () for the satellite and ¬•9.8 billion (US$116 million) for the launch. =Spacecraft design= The main bus is a box with two solar arrays, each with an area of about . The solar arrays provide over 700 W of power while in Venus orbit. The total mass of the spacecraft at launch was . The mass of the science payload is . Propulsion is provided by a bi-propellant, hydrazine- dinitrogen tetroxide orbital maneuvering engine and twelve mono-propellant hydrazine reaction control thrusters, eight with of thrust and four with . It is the first spacecraft to use a ceramic (silicon nitride) retrofire thruster. The total propellant mass at launch was . Communication is via an 8 GHz, 20-watt X-band transponder using the high-gain antenna. The high-gain antenna is flat to prevent heat from building up in it. Akatsuki also has a pair of medium-gain horn antennas mounted on turntables and two low-gain antennas for command uplink. The medium-gain horn antennas are used for housekeeping data downlink when the high-gain antenna is not facing Earth. Instruments The scientific payload consists of six instruments. The five imaging cameras are exploring Venus in wavelengths from ultraviolet to the mid-infrared: #the Lightning and Airglow Camera (LAC) is looking for lightning in the visible spectrum (552-777 nm) #the ultraviolet imager (UVI) is studying the distribution of specific atmospheric gases such as sulfur dioxide and the famous unknown absorber at ultraviolet wavelengths (283‚Äì365 nm) #the longwave infrared camera (LIR) is studying the structure of high-altitude clouds at a wavelength where they emit heat (10 Œºm) #the infrared 1 Œºm camera (IR1) is imaging on the night side heat radiation (0.90‚Äì1.01 Œºm) emitted from Venus's surface and help researchers to spot active volcanoes, if they exist.

Public relations  A public relations campaign was held between October 2009 and January 2010 by the Planetary Society and JAXA, to allow individuals to send their name and a message aboard Akatsuki. Names and messages were printed in fine letters on an aluminium plate and placed aboard Akatsuki. 260,214 people submitted names and messages for the mission. Around 90 aluminium plates were created for the spacecraft, including three aluminium plates in which the images of the Vocaloid Hatsune Miku and her super deformed figure Hachune Miku were printed. Operations =Launch= The launch of Akatsuki Akatsuki left the Sagamihara Campus on 17 March 2010, and arrived at the Tanegashima Space Center's Spacecraft Test and Assembly Building 2 on 19 March. On 4 May, Akatsuki was encapsulated inside the large payload fairing of the H-IIA rocket that launched the spacecraft, along with the IKAROS solar sail, on a 6-month journey to Venus. On 9 May, the payload fairing was transported to the Tanegashima Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building, where the fairing was mated to the H-IIA launch vehicle itself. The spacecraft was launched on 20 May 2010 at 21:58:22 (UTC) from the Tanegashima Space Center, after being delayed because of weather from its initial 18 May scheduled target. =Orbit insertion failure= Akatsuki was planned to initiate orbit insertion operations by igniting the orbital maneuvering engine at 23:49:00 on 6 December 2010 UTC. The burn was supposed to continue for twelve minutes, to an initial Venus orbit with an apoapsis of , a periapsis of , and a four-day orbital period. The orbit insertion maneuver was confirmed to have started on time, but after the expected blackout due to occultation by Venus, the communication with the probe did not recover as planned. The probe was found to be in safe-hold mode, spin-stabilized state with ten minutes per rotation. Due to the low communication speed through the low-gain antenna, it took a while to determine the state of the probe.JAXA's press briefing, 22:00, 7 December 2010 JST JAXA stated on 8 December that the probe's orbital insertion maneuver had failed. At a press conference on 10 December, officials reported that Akatsukis engines fired for less than three minutes, far less than what was required to enter into Venus orbit. Further research found that the likely reason for the engine malfunction was salt deposits jamming the valve between the helium pressurization tank and the fuel tank. As a result, engine combustion became oxidizer-rich, with resulting high combustion temperatures damaging the combustion chamber throat and nozzle. A similar vapor leakage problem destroyed the NASA Mars Observer probe in 1993. As a result, the probe was in a heliocentric orbit, rather than Venus orbit. Since the resulting orbit had an orbital period of 203 days,http://ccar.colorado.edu/ASEN5050/projects/projects_2016/Branham_Breana/voi.html (retrieved 13 June 2017) shorter than Venus' orbital period of 225 days, the probe drifted around the Sun compared to Venus. =Recovery efforts= JAXA developed plans to attempt another orbital insertion burn when the probe returned to Venus in December 2015. This required placing the probe into \\"hibernation\\" or safe mode to prolong its life beyond the original 4.5-year design. JAXA expressed some confidence in keeping the probe operational, pointing to reduced battery wear, since the probe was then orbiting the Sun instead of its intended Venusian orbit. Telemetry data from the original failure suggested that the throat of its main engine, the orbit maneuver engine (OME) was still largely intact, and trial jet thrusts of the probe's onboard OME were performed twice, on 7 and 14 September 2011. However, the thrust was only about , which was 10% of expectations. Following these tests, it was determined that insufficient specific impulse would be available for orbital maneuvering by the OME. It was concluded that the remaining combustion chamber throat was completely destroyed by transient ignition of the engine. As a result, the selected strategy was to use four hydrazine attitude control thrusters, also called reaction control system (RCS), to drive the probe into orbit around Venus. Because the RCS thrusters do not need oxidiser, the remaining 65 kg of oxidiser (MON) was vented overboard in October 2011 to reduce the mass of the spacecraft. Three peri-Venus orbital maneuvers were executed on 1 November, 10 and 21 November 2011 using the RCS thrusters. A total delta-v of 243.8 m/s was imparted to the spacecraft. Because the RCS thrusters' specific impulse is low compared to the specific impulse of the OME, the previously planned insertion into low Venusian orbit became impossible. Instead, the new plan was to place the probe in a highly elliptical orbit with an apoapsis of a hundred thousand kilometers and a periapsis of a few thousand kilometers from Venus. Engineers planned for the alternate orbit to be prograde (in the direction of the atmospheric super- rotation) and lie in the orbital plane of Venus. The method and orbit were announced by JAXA in February 2015, with an orbit insertion date of 7 December 2015. The probe reached its most distant point from Venus on 3 October 2013 and had been approaching the planet since then. =Orbit insertion= Animation of Akatsuki trajectory around Venus from 1 December 2015 After performing the last of a series of four trajectory correction maneuvers between 17 July and 11 September 2015, the probe was established on a trajectory to fly past Venus on 7 December 2015, when Akatsuki would make a maneuver to enter Venus orbit after a 20-minute burn with four thrusters that were not rated for such a hefty propulsive maneuver. Instead of taking about 30 hours to complete an orbit around Venus‚Äîas was originally planned‚Äîthe new orbit targeted would place Akatsuki in a nine-day orbit after an adjustment in March 2016. After JAXA engineers measured and calculated its orbit following the 7 December orbital insertion, JAXA announced on 9 December that Akatsuki had successfully entered the intended elliptical orbit, as far as from Venus, and as close as from Venus's surface with an orbital period of 13 days and 14 hours. A follow-up thruster burn on 26 March 2016 lowered Akatsuki's apoapsis to about and shortened its orbital period from 13 to 9 days. =Status= The orbiter started its two-year period of \\"regular\\" science operations in mid-May 2016. Since 9 December 2016, the near-infrared 1-Œºm and 2-Œºm cameras have been unavailable for observations due to an electronic failure. Its long-wave infrared camera, ultraviolet imager, and lightning and airglow camera continue normal operation. By April 2018, Akatsuki finished its regular observation phase, and entered an extended operation phase. Extended operations are approved until the end of 2020, with further mission extensions to be considered based on the spacecraft's condition at that time. Akatsuki has enough fuel to continue operating for at least 2 more years as of November 2019. Science Artist's concept of the Akatsuki spacecraft in orbit around Venus Three hours after insertion in December 2015 and in \\"a few glimmers in April and May\\" 2016 the craft's instruments recorded a \\"bow-shape feature in the atmosphere stretching 6,000 miles, almost pole to pole ‚Äî a sideways smile\\".Special issue \\"Akatsuki at Venus: The First Year of Scientific Operation. Masato Nakamura, Dmitri Titov, Kevin McGouldrick, Pierre Drossart, Jean-Loup Bertaux, Huixin Liu. Earth, Planets and Space. December 2018. Scientists on the project termed the feature a \\"gravity wave\\" in the planet's winds above Aphrodite Terra, \\"a highland region about the size of Africa that rises up to three miles from the surface\\". The mission is collecting data in all relevant spectral bands from ultraviolet (280 nm) to mid-infrared wavelengths (10 Œºm). Images from the Akatsuki orbiter revealed something similar to jet stream winds in the low and middle cloud region, which extends from 45 to 60 kilometers in altitude. The wind speed maximized near the equator. In September 2017 JAXA scientists named this phenomenon 'Venusian equatorial jet'. They also published results on equatorial winds at cloud-top level by tracking clouds on the UV spectrum.Mean winds at the cloud top of Venus obtained from two-wavelength UV imaging by Akatsuki.

A significant result in 2018 is the appearance of thick clouds of small particles near the transition between upper and middle clouds, what was described as a \\"new and puzzling morphology of the complex cloud cover.\\" By 2017, the science team published 3D maps on the Venus atmosphere structure.

History R√•gsved remained uninhabited until the mid-1950s. In 1953 a development plan was set up for the area. R√•gsveds centrum and R√•gsved metro station on the Stockholm metro were built in 1955-1957. The first areas built were the neighborhoods of Sn√∂s√§trah√∂jden and Bjurs√§trah√∂jden The neighbouring community of Hags√§tra was formed in 1959. In the early years, R√•gsved was mostly inhabited by expatriate workers from the inner city, particularly from S√∂dermalm, and was considered state of the art in the late 1950s. For a long time it was populated by highly paid, affluent tenants. While R√•gsved was built, an industrialization type of style dominated the construction, and this is visible at the houses located to the north of the subway. There, modernism made its mark, with more towers and slab blocks. R√•gsved centrum contains a horseshoe-shaped multi-building which holds different kinds of services and was designed by architects Kell √Östr√∂m (1920-2004) and Lars Bryde (1918-2002).

The population was 11,508 at the 2001 census, rising to 12,804 at the 2011 census. Overview There has been a settlement on the site for over 1,000 years, the earliest records being in the Domesday Book as Sitestone. The Roman road known as the Fosse Way passes through Syston, which is now largely a commuter town for the city of Leicester. Only the village of Thurmaston to the south separates it from Leicester. The large and impressive Church of St Peter and St Paul is the most ancient building in Syston, built in pink granite and white limestone with a proud west tower topped by a lozenge frieze, battlements and pinnacles. The church mostly dates from the 15th century but there is a 13th-century sedilia in the chancel and a tomb recess in the south aisle of the early 14th century. The stone arcading inside the nave has striking Perpendicular Gothic panelling which is also seen on the tower arch and in the clerestory. The nave roof of timber is also 15th century. The local architect Frederick Webster Ordish (1821-1885) extensively restored the church in 1871-72 and in 1881 he extended the nave by one bay and rebuilt the chancel. Ordish lived at Queniborough Old Hall. In 1855 he had added the upper storey, with its tower and bridge staircase, to the Corn Exchange in Leicester Market Place. He died as a result of an accident near the old Syston railway station in September 1885. The Midland Main Line runs through the town. Syston railway station currently has one platform on what remains of the former goods line, served by local Leicester to Lincoln via Nottingham and Newark services on the Ivanhoe Line. Motorcycle speedway (1930-1931) and greyhound racing (1931-1960s) was staged at the Syston Sports Stadium (not to be confused with the Syston Sports Ground next door) on Mostyn Avenue.Jones, Alan (2004) Speedway in Leicester: The Hunters Era, Automedia, p. 8 The 'Syston white plum' is well known in the Syston locality and has been grown there for well over 100 years.

Following early success in his home country with drama films such as Massacre in Rome with Richard Burton (based on the real- life Ardeatine massacre), Cosmatos retooled his career towards mainstream 'blockbuster' action and adventure films, including The Cassandra Crossing and Escape to Athena, both of which were British-Italian co-productions. After relocating to North America, he directed the horror film Of Unknown Origin. This was followed by some of his best-known work, including the action films Rambo: First Blood Part II and Cobra (both of which star Sylvester Stallone), the science-fiction horror film Leviathan, and the critically acclaimed Western Tombstone. Early life Cosmatos was born to a Greek family in Florence, Italy, and grew up in Egypt and Cyprus. He is said to have spoken six languages. After studying film at the London Film School, he became assistant director to Otto Preminger on Exodus (1960), based on Leon Uris's novel about the birth of Israel. Thereafter he worked on Zorba the Greek (1964), in which Cosmatos had a small part as Boy with Acne. Career Cosmatos found success in Italy for directing the films Rappresaglia (1973) with Marcello Mastroianni and The Cassandra Crossing (1976) with Sophia Loren. In 1979, he made the successful British World War II adventure movie Escape to Athena, starring an all-star ensemble cast including Roger Moore, David Niven, Telly Savalas, Elliott Gould and Claudia Cardinale. He made his North American directorial debut with the Canadian horror film Of Unknown Origin. He then directed the box-office hit Rambo: First Blood Part II starring Sylvester Stallone, and Cobra, another successful Stallone vehicle, in 1986. In 1989 he directed the science-fiction horror film Leviathan, starring Peter Weller, Richard Crenna, Ernie Hudson, and Amanda Pays, with special effects designed by Stan Winston. Late in his career, Cosmatos received more praise for Tombstone, a 1993 Western movie about Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. This film was particularly praised for the exceptional performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. Kurt Russell, who played Wyatt Earp, said Stallone recommended Cosmatos to him after the removal of the first director, writer Kevin Jarre, but Cosmatos had also worked with Tombstone executive producer Andrew G. Vajna before on Rambo: First Blood Part II. Outside of his film career, Cosmatos was a notable collector of rare books, focussing mainly on 19th-20th Century English literature and signed & inscribed works. His library was sold through Sotheby's.Catalogue: The Collection of George Cosmatos, Sotheby's, London, 23 March 2005 George P. Cosmatos died of lung cancer on 19 April 2005, at his home in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of 64. He was survived by one son, Panos Cosmatos, who has said that his independently released surreal film Beyond the Black Rainbow was funded primarily by royalties from his father's film Tombstone. Panos would later go on become a director in his own right, working primarily in the horror genre, where he is noted for the surreal atmosphere of his films.

It is the successor to the former Ordnance Survey of Ireland. It and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland (OSNI) are the ultimate successors to the Irish operations of the British Ordnance Survey. OSI is part of the Irish public service. OSI has made modern and historic maps of the state free to view on its website. OSI is headquartered at Mountjoy House in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Mountjoy House was also the headquarters, until 1922, of the Irish section of the British Ordnance Survey. Organisation Under the Ordnance Survey Ireland Act 2001, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland was dissolved and a new corporate body called Ordnance Survey Ireland was established in its place. OSI is now an autonomous corporate body, with a remit to cover its costs of operation from its sales of data and derived products, which has sometimes raised concerns about the mixing of public responsibilities with commercial imperatives. It employs 235 staff in the Phoenix Park and in six regional offices in Cork, Ennis, Kilkenny, Longford, Sligo and Tuam.A Brief History Ordnance Survey Ireland. OSI had sales of ‚Ç¨13.3 million in 2012. Products The most prominent consumer publications of OSI are the Dublin City and District Street Guide, an atlas of Dublin city, and the Complete Road Atlas of Ireland which it publishes in co-operation with Land and Property Services Northern Ireland (formerly the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland). The board also publishes (jointly with OSNI) a series of 1:50000 maps of the entire island known as the Discovery SeriesDiscovery Series Ordnance Survey Ireland and a series of 1:25000 maps of places of interest (such as the Aran Islands and Killarney national park) and the Geology of Ireland.Special Interest Maps Ordnance Survey Ireland History Mountjoy House, the headquarters of Ordnance Survey Ireland, in the Phoenix Park, Dublin Thomas Colby, the long-serving Director- General of the Ordnance Survey in Great Britain, was the first to suggest that the Ordnance Survey be used to map Ireland. A highly detailed survey of the whole of Ireland would be extremely useful for the British government, both as a key element in the process of levying local taxes based on land valuations and for military planning. In 1824, a committee was established under the direction of Thomas Spring Rice, MP for Limerick, to oversee the foundation of an Irish Ordnance Survey.Rachel Hewitt, 'Ensign of Empire', Map Of A Nation: A Biography Of The Ordnance Survey (Granta Books, 7 Jul 2011) Spring Rice believed in the importance of Irish involvement in the mapping process, but was overruled by the Duke of Wellington, who did not believe Irish surveyors were qualified for the task. Instead, the Irish Ordnance Survey was initially staffed entirely by members of the British Army. From 1825‚Äì46, teams of surveyors led by officers of the Royal Engineers, and men from the ranks of the Royal Sappers and Miners, traversed Ireland, creating a unique record of a landscape undergoing rapid transformation. The resulting maps (primarily at 6‚Ä≥ scale, with greater detail for urban areas, to an extreme extent in Dublin) portrayed the country in a degree of detail never attempted before, and when the survey of the whole country was completed in 1846, it was a world first. Both the maps and surveying were executed to a high degree of engineering excellence available at the time using triangulation and with the help of tools developed for the project, most notably the strong \\"limelight\\". The concrete triangulation posts built on the summits of many Irish mountains can still be seen to this day. The Royal Engineer officers in charge of the operation were Thomas Colby and Lieutenant Thomas Larcom. They were assisted by George Petrie, who headed the Survey's Topographical Department which employed the likes of John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry in scholarly research into placenames. Captain J.E. Portlock compiled extensive information on agricultural produce and natural history, particularly geology. Despite the exclusion of Irish surveyors, this mapping scheme provided numerous opportunities for employment to Irish people, who worked as skilled or semi- skilled fieldwork labourers, and as clerks in the subsidiary Memoir project that was designed to illustrate and complement the maps by providing data on the social and productive worth of the country. The total cost of the Irish Survey was ¬£860,000 (adjusted for inflation, equivalent to approximately ¬£100,000,000 in 2018). The original survey was later revisited and revised maps issued on a number of occasions. All of these historical maps (at least up to 1922) are in the public domain and while the originals can be hard to find, they can be freely reproduced. =From 1922= The British Ordnance Survey ceased to map Ireland just before the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 (the Partition of Ireland having already taken place in May 1921 upon the creation of Northern Ireland). The new Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland (OSNI) officially came into existence on 1 January 1922, while the new Ordnance Survey of Ireland (OSI) came into being slightly later, on 1 April 1922. The OSI was initially part of the Irish Army under the Department of Defence. All staff employed were military personnel until the 1970s, when the first civilian employees were recruited. In more recent times, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland replaced traditional ground surveying with mapping based primarily on aerial photography. It has also worked with the postal service, An Post, to gather and structure geographic data. Cultural depiction The national survey carried out between 1825 and 1846 is the focus of the 1981 play Translations by Brian Friel.

He was a pioneer of tropical medicine, pharmacognosy and ethnobotany, working mainly in Goa, then a Portuguese overseas territory. Garcia de Orta used an experimental approach to the identification and use of herbal medicines rather than the traditional approach of using received knowledge. His magnum opus was a book on the simples (herbs used singly) and drugs published in 1563 Col√≥quios dos simples e drogas da India, the earliest treatise on the medicinal and economic plants of India. Carolus Clusius translated it into Latin which was widely used as a standard reference text on medicinal plants. Garcia de Orta died before the Inquisition began in Goa but in 1569 his sister was burnt at the stake for being a secret Jew and based on her confession his remains were later exhumed and burnt along with an effigy. Memorials recognizing his contributions have been built both in Portugal and India.  Life  Col√≥quios (1563) Garcia de Orta was born in Castelo de Vide, probably in 1501, the son of Fern√£o (Isaac) da Orta, a merchant, and Leonor Gomes. He had three sisters, Violante, Catarina and Isabel. Their parents were Spanish Jews from Valencia de Alc√°ntara who had taken refuge, as many others did, in Portugal at the time of the great expulsion of the Spanish Jews by the Reyes Catolicos Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain in 1492. Forcibly converted to Christianity in 1497, they were pejoratively classed as Crist√£os Novos (New Christians) and marranos (\\"swine\\"). Some of these refugees maintained their Jewish faith secretly. A friendly neighbour at Castelo de Vide was the nobleman Dom Fern√£o de Sousa, Lord of Labruja, who may have influenced the idea for Garcia's father to send him to University. Dom Fern√£o's son Martim Afonso de Sousa would become a key figure in later life. Garcia studied medicine, arts and philosophy at the Universities of Alcal√° de Henares and Salamanca in Spain. He graduated and returned to Portugal in 1525, two years after his father's death. He practiced medicine first in his home town and from 1526 onwards in Lisbon, where he gained a lecturership at the university in 1532. He also became royal physician to John III of Portugal. Perhaps fearing the increasing power of the Portuguese Inquisition, and fortunately evading the ban on emigration of New Christians, he sailed for Portuguese India leaving Tagus in March 1534 as Chief Physician aboard the fleet of Martim Afonso de Sousa, later to be named Governor. He reached Goa in September. He travelled with Sousa on various campaigns, then, in 1538, settled at Goa, where he soon had a prominent medical practice. He was physician to Burhan Nizam Shah I of the Nizam Shahi dynasty of Ahmadnagar, and concurrently to several successive Portuguese Viceroys and governors of Goa. While Garcia de Orta was physician of the Sultan and teacher of Portuguese of his son, the Prince, he met and dined several times with the high ranking cavalry general of the Sultan, Firangi Khan. Garcia de Orta reports that the cavalry commander violated sometimes religious directives, eating pork and drinking wine in these private dinners. Firangi Khan had converted to Islam for apparently material reasons and had a very important role in the court of the Sultanate, but subsidized charities to Miseric√≥rdias in the relationship he had with the Portuguese empire (despite serving an intermittent enemy Muslim state) and, according to Orta, \\"urged other Christians to never abdicate their principles.\\" He even projected return to his home city in his country (already secretly pardoned by the viceroy Afonso de Noronha). Firangi Khan was not his title (and name, which literally means \\"foreigner Khan\\") of origin. His name was Sancho Pires, a formerly gunner (bombardeiro), Portuguese, and natural of Matosinhos. He died in battle in India. The King of Portugal through the Viceroy Dom Pedro Mascarenhas granted a lifelong lease (on payment of a quit-rent) to Garcia da Orta for the Ilha da Boa Vida (\\"the Island of the Good Life\\") which became a part of Bombay. This was probably somewhere between September 1554 and June 1555. The only condition of the lease was that he had to improve the place. He had a manor house with a large garden. He probably maintained an excellent library here. This manor stood not far from where the Town Hall of Bombay was built. Garcia probably let out the house to Simao Toscano. At the time of Bombay's transfer to the English, the manor was occupied by Dona Ignez de Miranda, widow of Dom Rodrigo de Monsanto. It was in this house that the treaty by which Bombay was transferred to the English was signed by Humphrey Cooke on February 18, 1665. Garcia describes the people around Bassein and their traditions in his book. Contrary to some early biographical accounts, Garcia de Orta married a wealthy cousin, Brianda de Solis, in 1543; the marriage was unhappy, but the couple had two daughters. In 1549 his mother and two of his sisters, who had been imprisoned as Jews in Lisbon, managed to join him in Goa. According to a confession by his brother-in-law after his death, Garcia de Orta privately continued to assert that \\"the Law of Moses was the true law\\";Inquisition records quoted in Silva Carvalho (1934):74, 159. in other words, he, probably in common with others in his family, remained a Jewish believer. In 1565 an inquisitorial court was opened in Goa. Active persecution against Jews, secret Jews, Hindus and New Christians began. Garcia himself died in 1568, apparently without having suffered seriously from this persecution, but his sister Catarina was arrested as a Jew in the same year and was burned at the stake for Judaism in Goa on October 25, 1569. Garcia himself was posthumously convicted of Judaism. His remains were exhumed and burned along with an effigy in an auto da f√© on December 4, 1580. They were among 342 New Christians accused of crypto-Judaism of whom 68 were executed between 1561 and 1623. His books were most likely burnt as well, possibly a reason why no copy of his book exists in Goa.Carvalho (1934):pp. 72-84; R√©vah, 1960. The fate of his daughters is not known. During his lifetime, Orta's family members, including his mother and sisters were arrested and interrogated briefly in Portugal but they were probably protected by his friend and patron, Martim Afonso de Sousa, who was Governor-General of Portuguese India from 1542 to 1545.  Work  Cover of Clusius' 1574 Latin translation. Garcia de Orta's busy practice evidently prevented him from travelling much beyond the west coast of India, but in the busy market and trading hub of Goa he met spice merchants, traders and physicians from many parts of southern Asia and the Indian Ocean coasts. He was confident in Portuguese, Spanish, Hebrew, Latin, Greek and Arabic (he did not know Sanskrit); his work shows that he gathered considerable knowledge from traditional medicine practitioners from several regions of India. Correspondents and agents sent him seeds and plants; he also traded in spices, drugs and precious stones. He evidently kept a laboratory and botanical garden. De Orta was influenced by Yunnani medicine as well as Ayurveda, although quoting Galen, al-Rhazi and Ibn-Sina more often. He tended to use European approaches in medicine and only when they failed did he make use of local methods. His remarkable knowledge of Eastern spices and drugs is revealed in his only known work, Col√≥quios dos simples e drogas he cousas medicinais da √çndia (\\"Conversations on the simples, drugs and medicinal substances of India\\"), the first edition of which was published at Goa in 1563. This book deals with a series of substances, many of them unknown or the subject of confusion and misinformation in Europe at this period. For instance, prior to his publication, tamarind was thought to come from a palm tree. He also noted many details on plants and their propagation. He was the first European to describe the symptoms of several Asiatic tropical diseases, notably cholera; he performed an autopsy on a cholera victim, the first recorded autopsy in India. Garcia de Orta reveals in his writings an unusual independence in face of the usually revered texts of ancient authorities, Greek, Latin and Arabic. The Coloquios has 59 chapters and it was written in the style of a dialogue between da Orta and a traditional doctor, Ruano. Using a dialogue form was a common literary practice when dealing with the tensions between established and new forms of knowledge. Orta's work questions assumptions made in the past with alternative hypotheses to the ideas from Ibn-Sina and Averroes. His scientific method has been suggested to be a combination of empiricism and hypothesism. Da Orta critiqued the work of Leonhart Fuchs. Through his character he commented that Fuchs \\"...knew little of physic, and still less of things to save his soul, being a heretic condemned for Lutheranism. His books were put in the condemned catalogue\\" and \\"though medicine is not the science of the Christian religion, still I abhor the author\\". In one place he points out that the Portuguese traders took little interest in acquiring knowledge: The printing press was introduced into Goa in 1556. The printer for Garcia is thought to have been Jo√£o de Endem who began with Joao Quinquenio de Campania and continued after him. The rare first edition was full of typographical errors and was only the fifth European book ever printed in Goa and among the first few from India. The errata, probably the longest in printing history, ran to twenty pages and end with a statement that the list was probably incomplete. The English translation by Clements Markham included illustrations of some of the Indian plants by Crist√≥v√£o da Costa. Markham considered da Costa's work published in Spanish in 1578, Tractado de las drogas y medicinas de las Indias orientales (\\"Treatise of the drugs and medicines of the East Indies\\") to be largely based on that of de Orta but some others have pointed out significant differences. Garcia's travels to Portuguese Ceylon (Jaffna) on campaigns with Martim allowed him to study Sri Lankan medicinal plants. Among the descriptions from here are plants used in the treatment of snakebite. Some of the information is based on folklore, such as the plants that were supposedly eaten by mongoose after being bitten by cobras. Orta also described plants of forensic importance such as the use of Datura used by thieves and robbers to poison their victims. The preface of the book includes a verse by his friend the poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, now considered as Portugal's national poet. Luis de Cam√µes had been worked briefly in Portuguese Macau before returning to Goa in 1561. In his poem Os Lus√≠adas, Cam√µes plays on the word \\"Orta\\" which refers to his friend as well as mean \\"garden\\". The book was dedicated to Dom Francisco Coutinho, Count of Redondo, Viceroy of Goa from 1561 to 1564, and to his friend Martim de Sousa. In the preface he pointed out that he could well have written the book in Latin but chose Portuguese so that the traders and other locals could make use of it. Garcia de Orta's work was accidentally discovered by Clusius in early 1564 and he translated it into Latin, while also changing it from a dialogue to an epitomized form, and this was widely read across Europe and underwent several editions.  Books  Statue of Garcia de Orta by Martins Correia at the Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Lisbon The first edition of Garcia de Orta's book was in Portuguese and published from Goa in 1563 and had 217 pages. Only about six copies were thought to exist according to Valentine Ball in 1890. A second version was published in Lisbon in 1872. An abridged Latin version was produced by Carolus Clusius in 1567 with subsequent editions in 1574, 1579, 1582, 1584, 1593, 1595 and 1605/6. A translation of the Latin version into Italian was produced by Annibal de Briganti in 1576, followed by other editions in 1582, 1589 and 1616. A Spanish version of the Tractado of Cristobal A'Costa which included Clusius's abridgement and A'Costas's personal observation was published in 1578 from Burgos. * Coloquios dos Simples e Drogas da India.

(), known as BMPS or just MPS, is an Italian bank. Tracing its history to a mount of piety founded in 1472 () and founded in its present form in 1624 (), it is the world's oldest or second oldest bank, depending on the definition, and the fourth largest Italian commercial and retail bank. In 1995 the bank, then known as Monte dei Paschi di Siena, was transformed from a statutory corporation to a limited company called Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (Banca MPS). The Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena was created to continue the charitable functions of the bank and to be, until the bailout in 2013, its largest single shareholder. Today Banca MPS has approximately 2,000 branches, 26,000 employees and 5.1 million customers in Italy, as well as branches and businesses abroad. A subsidiary, MPS Capital Services, handles corporate and investment banking. According to a research by Mediobanca and a press release by Banco BPM, Banco BPM overtook BMPS as the third largest commercial banking group in Italy in terms of total assets on 31 December 2016, after Banco BPM's formal formation on 1 January 2017. In 2016‚Äì17, BMPS was struggling to avoid a collapse, and was bailed out again by the Italian government in July 2017. On 5 October 2018, Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced the sale of its Belgian subsidiary, Banca Monte Paschi Belgio (BMPB) to a company participated by funds managed by Warburg Pincus. The sale price was set at ‚Ç¨42 million, subject to an adjustment mechanism. History Monte dei Paschi di Siena Headquarter's Main Entrance, Palazzo Salimbeni, Siena Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena traces its history to a mount of piety (monte di piet√†) founded by order of the Magistrature of the Republic of Siena on 4 March 1472, when its statute was approved. It is therefore often regarded as being the oldest bank in the world in continuous operation. The basis of its foundation is the Statuto dei Paschi, written in 1419, a law that regulated all activities related to agriculture and pastoralism in Maremma. Its current form dates from 1624, when Siena was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and Grand Duke Ferdinando II granted to depositors of Monte, in their warranty, the income of the state- owned pastures of Maremma (the so-called \\"Paschi\\" which gave the bank its name). The bank consolidated and increased its banking activity during the 17th and 18th centuries. With the unification of Italy, the bank expanded its business throughout the Italian peninsula, initiating new activities, including mortgage loans, the first experience in Italy. MPS was also involved in the bail-out of Cassa di Risparmio di Prato, becoming the major shareholder. In 1995, a decree of the Ministry of the Treasury of the Italian Republic dated 8 August 1995, gave rise to two institutions: Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A. and Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a non-profit organization with the statutory purpose of providing assistance, charity and social utility in the fields of education, science, health and art, especially with reference to the city and the province of Siena. On 25 June 1999, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena was listed successfully on the Italian Stock Exchange. =Expansion (2000‚Äì2006)= Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena in city of Pisa After its debut on the Italian Stock Exchange, the bank began an intense phase of commercial and operational expansion. The bank acquired some regional banks: Banca Agricola Mantovana and Banca del Salento, while subsidiary Banca Toscana was absorbed. In 2003, the controlling interests (79%) of Cassa di Risparmio di Prato was sold to Banca Popolare di Vicenza in March 2003 for ‚Ç¨411.2 million. The bank had also started a process to reinforce the structures of production in strategic market segments through the development of product companies: * Consum.it in the sector of consumer credit * MPS Leasing and Factoring in the parabanking sector * MPS Finance in investment banking * MP Asset Management SGR in managed savings * MPS Bsersonale in financial promotion * MPS Banca per l'Impresa in credit for businesses and corporate finance services At the same time, the bank upgraded its commercial productivity, with the aim of improving the level of assistance and consultancy to investors and businesses, and updated its activities in private banking and in private pension plans. At the conclusion of this plan of expansion, the bank implemented a vast program of opening new branches of the Group, with more than 2,000 branches. In order to finance this expansion model, the bank entered into some derivatives that were hidden: operations Santorini in 2002 and Alexandria in 2006.\\"doppio-flop-derivati\\" (in Italian), Ilsole24ore 24 January 2013. =Antonveneta acquisition (2006‚Äì2008)= On 8 November 2007, Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced that it had reached an agreement with Banco Santander to buy Banca Antonveneta for ‚Ç¨9 billion excluding the subsidiary Interbanca that is owned by the Spanish bank. Antonveneta is the bank that after the Bancopoli scandal was acquired by ABN AMRO and was supposed to go to Banco Santander after the purchase of the Dutch bank by the consortium of RBS, Santander, Fortis. From February 2007 to June 2008 Banca MPS sold all the shares (27.839%) in Finsoe, an intermediate holding company of Unipol Group, for ‚Ç¨584.8 million. In 2008, Quadrifoglio Vita, a joint venture insurance company of Unipol and Banca Agricola Mantovana, was acquired by AXA from Unipol via Banca MPS, Banca Agricola Mantovana was also absorbed into Banca MPS. Banca MPS also acquired regional bank Cassa di Risparmio di Biella e Vercelli from Intesa Sanpaolo in December 2007 for about ‚Ç¨399 million. =Global financial crisis (2008‚Äì2012)= Monte dei Paschi di Siena Group global locations in 2008 In the wake of rising yields and declining valuations on Italian government debt in the European sovereign-debt crisis, MPS lost over $2 billion in the first half of 2012, had to recapitalize, and faced restructuring or worse. The majority owner until the recapitalization, the Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena, long resisted issuing new capital which would dilute its holding. In September 2012, even after the dilution, the bank \\"appear[ed] poised\\" also to give the national government a greater ownership stake in return for more capital.Birnbaum, Michael, \\"In Italy, world‚Äôs oldest bank faces uncertain future\\", Washington Post, 1 September 2012. Retrieved 2 September 2012. In December 2012, Cassa di Risparmio di Biella e Vercelli was sold to Cassa di Risparmio di Asti for about ‚Ç¨205.5 million. =Hidden losses and Bank of Italy bailout (2013)= In 2009, the Santorini and Alessandria operations began creating huge losses. In order to hide them in the bank's financial statements, the top management, including Giuseppe Mussari, the bank president, chose to enter into derivative contracts with Deutsche Bank and Nomura. This arrangement eventually led to prison sentences for 13 bank executives. Estimates of the losses accumulated by the Santorini and Alessandria operations in the period leading up to the derivative contracts range from ‚Ç¨500 to ‚Ç¨750 million.\\"ombre-derivati-monte- titolo\\" (in Italian), Ilsole24ore, 24 January 2013.

Retrieved 26 January 2013. The firm sparked fresh controversy in 2013 when it was accused of misleading Italy's market regulator in October 2012, shortly before it received a 4.1-billion euro ($5.47 billion) state bailout. On 29 December 2013, Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena rejected plans for issuing ‚Ç¨3 billion worth of new shares, delaying the raising of capital until at least May 2014 and increasing the risk of nationalization. In November 2019, after a three- year trial, 13 former bank executives received prison sentences. The Monte dei Paschi ex-chairman and CEO received seven years each; two senior executives five and four years. Three bankers from Deutsche Bank received five years and two from Nomura received five and three years. They had conspired to hide Monte dei Pasche's losses of ‚Ç¨2bn between 2008 and 2012 by using complicated derivative contracts. Deutsche Bank and Nomura were fined ‚Ç¨160m; Monte dei Pasche had paid ‚Ç¨10.6m after a plea bargain in 2016.\\"The men from Monte\\", Private Eye, no. 1509, p 41, 15 November 2019 =2014‚Äìpresent= In March 2014, BlackRock declared a 5.748 percent stake in the bank (as the bank was still a constituent of stock market indices at that time, such as the FTSE MIB, fund managers held stakes in their index tracking funds, and were required to disclose stakes of 5% or higher). In July, the capital increase was completed, of which the banking foundation had just owned 2.500% shares. In October, the bank failed the ECB's stress test of major European banks, (first Comprehensive Assessment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism) and was given two weeks to prepare a plan to raise ‚Ç¨2.11 billion in capital. Despite issuing ‚Ç¨5 billion in shares just four months earlier, the ECB declared the bank unable to withstand a financial catastrophe. Shares proceeded to drop 22%.\\"clock-ticks-for-banca-monte-dei-paschi\\", online.wsj.com In November, 2014, the bank reported a loss of ‚Ç¨1.1497 billion in the 3rd quarter of the year.\\"Nearly $1 billion loss for 3rd quarter\\", New York Times, 12 November 2014. Eventually in 2014 financial year, the bank had a net loss of ‚Ç¨5.3429 billion, resulting in the capital increase to be vaporized. The Tier 1 capital ratio of the bank was 8.7% as at 31 December 2014. On 6 July 2015, following the Greek bailout referendum, trading in Monte dei Paschi shares was suspended after they fell 5.7%. Eventually Banca MPS achieved a net profit of ‚Ç¨388 million in 2015. but mainly due to the effect of the restatement as a CDS derivative of the Alexandria transaction. The CET1 capital ratio of the bank was 12%, mainly due to another capital increase during the year, which the European Central Bank required Banca MPS to have a minimum of 10.75% from 31 December 2016 onward, or 10.2% in the transitional period. Moreover, both the gross (34%) and net non-performing loan to total loan ratio (22%) were still higher than the Italian average (18.1% in gross and 10.8% in net at December 2015) and the Italian average itself was higher than the European Union average. On 21 January 2016 MPS securitized ‚Ç¨1.6 billion performing lease receivables portfolio for a value of ‚Ç¨1.4173 billion. The bank repurchased ‚Ç¨656 million of the securities (tranches B to D) and sold ‚Ç¨761.3 million of the securities to the market (tranche A). In April 2016 German Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret commented that many Greek and Italian banks were zombie banks that were kept for political reasons. He urged that European Central Bank should deal with banks with high level of non-performing loans. However, he did not state specifically if BMPS was one of the zombie banks or not. On 23 June a gross value of ‚Ç¨290 million bad loan portfolio was disposed of without recourse to Kruk Group. On 4 July the bank confirmed that a request of reducing non-performing loans from European Central Bank was received. In 2015 the bank had ‚Ç¨46.9 billion NPLs in gross and ‚Ç¨24.2 billion in net. The bank targeted to reduce the gross NPLs to total loans ratio to 20% in 2018. However, this was still higher than the Italian average at 31 December 2015. On 29 July 2016, 2016 European Union bank stress test was announced. Among the 51 banks in the test, BMPS was the only bank that CET1 ratio (in full Basel III basis) was forecast as negative in the adverse scenario in 2018. If setting CET1 Ratio and Total Capital Ratio (fully loaded basis) targets at 8% and 11.5% respectively even in the adverse scenario in 2018, it would mean the bank would have a capital shortfall of ‚Ç¨8.8 billion (core tier 1, additional tier 1 and tier 2 capitals combined), according to European Central Bank publication on 29 December 2016. On the same day, the plan to recapitalize the bank for ‚Ç¨5 billion was announced; the bank also planned to securitize the entire bad loan portfolio for a target of ‚Ç¨9.2 billion, which had a net book value of ‚Ç¨10.2 billion as at 31 March 2016. The junior tranche would be allocated to the shareholders of the bank (for a proposed ‚Ç¨1.6 billion); the mezzanine tranche would be sold to Atlante for ‚Ç¨1.6 billion (revised to purchase junior mezzanine tranche for ‚Ç¨1.526 billion in December 2016); the senior tranches would be sold to the market with some of them being eligible to state guarantee (Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze) for ‚Ç¨6 billion. It was expected to reduce the gross NPLs ratio to 17.8%, on par with Italian average but still higher than many European peers. In December 2016, the disposal plan was modified: a senior mezzanine tranche (for ‚Ç¨1.171 billion) was added‚Äîto be underwritten by the bank itself. In September 2016, CEO Fabrizio Viola and chairman Massimo Tononi resigned. They were replaced by Marco Morelli and Alessandro Falciai, respectively. On 28 November 2016, every 100 BMPS shares were converted into one (1) new BMPS share and, on 2 December 2016, AXA and BMPS announced a renewal of their partnership bancassurance‚Äîan agreement intended to prevail until 2027. In December 2016, BMPS successfully made debt-to-equity swap for part of their subordinated debt and Tier 1 capital instrument, for a maximum price of ‚Ç¨24.9 per new share (on top of ‚Ç¨5 billion new shares issue). In mid-December, BMPS reopened the offer for the swap, which reached approx. ‚Ç¨2.451 billion. However, due to the failure to issue ‚Ç¨5 billion new shares, the swap offer and disposal of NPLs were voided. Although J.P. Morgan, Mediobanca, Banco Santander, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs had signed a pre-underwriting agreement with BMPS in July. No banks and no anchor investor entered into contracts with BMPS. At 01:20am, on 23 December 2016, the midnight after the failed recapitalisation, BMPS requested a precautionary recapitalisation by the Italian Government in order to bail out the bank by excising Article 32(4) of EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (The EU- wide banking resolution law, which restricted state aid to a mean of last resort). On 20 December the Italian Government had already raised ‚Ç¨20 billion to set up a save-savings () fund in order to subscribe a possible recapitalisation of UniCredit, BMPS, Banca Popolare di Vicenza, Veneto Banca and Banca Carige, as well as banks that need recapitalisation in the near future. It was reported that the subordinate bond would be mandatorily converted to shares by the resolution authority of Italy (which is Bank of Italy) as a \\"bail-in\\". However, the bank had requested a Tier 2 subordinate capital instrument \\"Fresh 2008\\" excluded from such bail-in, as many investors were retail investors. On 25 January 2017 BMPS issued bonds with ‚Ç¨7 billion face value. The bonds would mature from 1 to 3 years, with the state guarantee from the aforementioned government fund. The bank said the bond would be sold to the market or used as a collateral in borrowing process. On 3 February 2017 BMPS sold its card business to Istituto Centrale delle Banche Popolari Italiane (ICBPI) for ‚Ç¨520 million. Other leading banks of Italy, such as Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit had already sold their division in 2016. On 9 February 2017 BMPS announced their 2016 financial results subject to the approval of general shareholders' meeting. The bank 2016 revenue, net interest income and pre-provision profit were decreased, compared to 2015. Combined with the write-down and provisions for NPLs, the net loss of the year was ‚Ç¨3.380 billion. The CET1 ratio was reaching the legal minimal threshold of 8.0% (below ECB requirement in individual basis on the bank for 10.75%) On 1 June 2017 European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager agreed in-principle for the state aid of the bank. On 5 July, the industrial plan of the bank was approved, which the bank would be re-capitalized for ‚Ç¨8.1 billion, but only ‚Ç¨3.9 billion would be underwritten by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (excluding additional shares that would be buyback from retail bondholders by the government), with the rest were the \\"bail-in\\" of bondholders, mandatorily converted the bond of the bank to shares. On 29 July, the bank announced that the issue price of the new shares to the government was ‚Ç¨6.49, with ‚Ç¨8.65 for debt-to-equity shares.

However, this collection is not usually open to the public. The most recent publicly known acquisition of art, a gold-plated panel by Segna di Bonaventura, cost the bank nearly one million Euro. It is also internationally known as the primary sponsor of Italian basketball club Mens Sana Basket of Siena, currently in Lega A and a regular participant in the Euroleague. In 2010, the bank was funding the expansion of a small airport in the heart of the Tuscan countryside, Siena‚ÄìAmpugnano Airport, to become an international airport. Both international and local groups had raised objections to this expansion on the grounds it would damage the natural beauty of the area, the environment and the attraction of the countryside to tourism. Eventually, Aeroporto di Siena S.p.A., the company incorporated for the project, was liquidated . Until the euro-crisis, profits from the bank financed the Palio di Siena, Siena's historic-building renovations and \\"biotech programs\\" intended to turn the Tuscan plain into a research hub. Nearly all that money ‚Äì $150 million a year, on average, from 1996 to 2010 ‚Äì has \\"evaporated\\" since 2010. According to the annual report of the banking foundation, which acted as both the largest shareholders of the bank and the charity organization for Tuscan area, the foundation suffered a sharp decrease in revenue from the bank in 2009, which dropped from ‚Ç¨340 million to just ‚Ç¨62.5 million, thus affecting the endowment to other organizations. Along with other loss related and not related to the bank since 2010, the foundation had to suspend all the endowment to other organizations.

It is located from the center of Paris, in its western suburbs. As the site where many of the French Masters (including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, and Auguste Renoir) painted country scenes along the Seine, the village today hosts a series of six historical placards, known as the \\"Impressionists Walk,\\" at locations from which the noted painters depicted the scenes of Bougival. Bougival is also noted as the site of the Machine de Marly, a sprawling, complicated hydraulic pumping device that began supplying the massive quantity of water required by the fountains at Palace of Versailles in the late 17th century. Considered one of the foremost engineering accomplishments of its era, the cacophonous, breakdown-prone apparatus comprised fourteen waterwheels (approximately 38 feet in diameter) driven by the current of the Seine -- in turn powering more than 250 pumps, delivering water up a 500-foot vertical rise through a series of pumping stations, holding tanks, reservoirs, pipes and mechanical linkages. In use until 1817, the machine was subsequently updated, replaced with another pumping building in 1858 and finally replaced by an electrical generator in 1963. The building itself remained until 1968. Remnants are visible today at the riverbank. In Bougival, Georges Bizet composed the opera Carmen at his home at Rue Ivan Tourguenievf on the Seine and noted Russian novelist and playwright Ivan Turgenev built a dacha, Les Fr√™nes. A local monument commemorates the Montgolfier brothers, pioneers of flight, and the commune hosts the annual Festival of Bougival et des Coteaux de Seine. History In the 19th century, Bougival emerged as a fashionable suburb of Paris. Pauline Viardot had a villa there, as did her paramour Ivan Turgenev, who died in the town in 1883. Bougival was also known as the \\"Cradle of Impressionism\\" during the Belle √âpoque. Painters Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Sisley among others painted the light, sky, and water of this area. Alexandre Dumas, fils set parts of his novel The Lady of the Camellias in Bougival. The Junior division of the British School of Paris (formerly the English School of Paris) was located in Bougival up until 2008. Prior to the English School, it was a Catholic all-girls school called Marymount in the 1960s. It was reported that the Germans occupied the estate during World War II, along with the nuns that lived there, due to the estate's vantage point of the Seine River.

They were designed by Ralph Erskine and constructed in the 1970s. The wall is just part of the estate, which in total covers . Design and construction The Wall, along with the low rise dwellings built to its south, replaced Victorian slum terraced housing. There were nearly 1200 houses on the site at Byker. They had been condemned as unfit for human habitation in 1953, and demolition began in 1966. The new housing block was designed by Ralph Erskine assisted by Vernon Gracie. Design began in 1968 and construction took place between 1969 and 1982. The architects opened an office on site to develop communication and trust between the existing residents. Existing buildings were to be demolished as the new accommodation was built. The new high-rise block was designed to shield the site from an intended motorway (which eventually was never built). Construction materials for Byker Wall were relatively cheap, concrete, brick and timber. Surfaces were treated with bright colours, while brick bandings were used on the 'Wall' to indicate floor levels. Its Functionalist Romantic styling with textured, complex facades, colourful brick, wood and plastic panels, attention to context, and relatively low-rise construction represented a major break with the Brutalist high-rise architectural orthodoxy of the time.Egelius, Mats (1980) Byker redevelopment, Byker area of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, 1969-82; architect: Ralph Erskine. Global architecture 1980, n.55, whole issue Following completion, fewer than 20% of the original local residents were housed at Byker Wall. Refurbishment Refurbishment of the whole estate was commenced in partnership with Your Homes Newcastle (YHN), the social housing arm of Newcastle City Council. The work was undertaken by Mansell, a division of Balfour Beatty. The work involved careful reinstatement of original features and colour schemes, using modernised materials where possible, while retaining the look and feel of the 1970s design scheme. For example, a new coloured aluminium window frame was designed to allow for improved security and insulation, without compromising the visual impact of the buildings. The most recent phase of this was completed in June 2008. A bid for PFI funding from the Homes and Communities Agency (to the value of ¬£80 million) was sought in June 2009 to fund the project, which was estimated to cost ¬£210 million, but was rejected as it did not meet the criteria; subsequent negotiations with the Department for Communities and Local Government led to the creation of the Byker Community Trust in 2012. A two-year refurbishment programme with a budget of ¬£26 million began in April 2014. New roofs, doors and windows will be installed and the estate will be repainted in line with the original colour scheme. In February 2019 local company JDDK were appointed to undertake further upgrades to the estate on a ¬£4 million contract.https://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/erskines-byker-wall-estate-set- for-4m-upgrade/5097635.article Byker Community Trust The Byker Community Trust (‚ÄòBCT‚Äô) was incorporated in September 2011 under the Industrial and Provident Society Act 1965 with charitable objectives.

In 2003 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced a proposal to award the Byker estate, of which the Wall forms a part, a Grade II listed rating as an example of outstanding architecture. In January 2007, the Estate became a grade II* listed building (grade two star).

It runs 670 km east from Owendo port station in Libreville to Franceville via numerous stations, the main ones being Ndjol√©, Lop√©, Boou√©, Lastoursville and Moanda.  History  A railway was first planned in 1885. Investigations into the line were conducted in 1968, funding was agreed in 1973, and construction began the following year. The first section, from Owendo to Ndjol√©, opened in 1978, with the remaining sections opening in stages until December 1986. Costs were well over budget and almost bankrupted the country. The Trans-Gabon Railroad is overall adjacent the Ogooue River until Ndjol√©. Most important constructions are the Juckville Tunnel, the viaduct over the Abanga swamp, and the bridge over the confluence between the Ogooue and the Ivindo Rivers. The line to Franceville was completed in 1987. Originally intended to reach Makokou and carry iron ore, its route was changed for political reasons, namely to keep within national borders manganese ore traffic from COMILOG that went on the COMILOG Cableway via the Republic of Congo. When the railway reached the manganese mine at Moanda, the Cableway was closed. The railway was privatised in 1999. Plans regularly surface proposing an extension to Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo. =Construction and specifications = Because the line was built well into the era of earthmoving machinery, the need to choose a narrow gauge to save costs was no longer important. However the choice of standard gauge () took advantage of off the shelf equipment. It was constructed by a consortium of Impregilo, Astaldi, Philipp Holzmann, Constructions Et Entreprises Industrielles and Entreprise De Construction Franco-Africaine.Trans-Gabon Railway Following the injection of sterling from the then P.M Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative government, the discovery of uranium helped to secure British interest in the project. Many UK expatriates took the place of French workers and the building of the railway progressed rapidly from this point. Circa May 1983 CCI Eurotrag (a consortium of British, Italian and German interests) took over funding. British firms involved included Wimpey International, who seconded staff to Taylor Woodrow. The initial building of 182kms from Owendo to Ndjole took over 10 years to complete. The remaining 400+kms took only 5 years. =Recent history= In 2003 Hughes Network Systems (see Hughes Communications) installed a satellite based telephony system into all the railway stations of the railway. In June 2006 a new line for iron ore from Belinga to port was announced. It is unclear if it will use part of the existing line. The track will be standard gauge.China given monopoly to work Gabon's untapped iron ore resources This line was supposed to open in 2012, but in 2014 completion is still awaited. Two EMD JT42CWR locomotives shipped September 2011. A further 4 locomotives and 10 passenger coaches were also ordered. On 18 May 2019 three workers were killed in an accident on the line. Network There are no links with the adjacent states of Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, or the Republic of the Congo. The railway is important for transporting timber and uranium in addition to being the only important public transport route in the nation.

It is the simplest and smallest ketone. It is a colourless, highly volatile and flammable liquid with a characteristic pungent odour. Acetone is miscible with water and serves as an important organic solvent in its own right, in industry, home, and laboratory. About 6.7 million tonnes were produced worldwide in 2010, mainly for use as a solvent and production of methyl methacrylate and bisphenol A.Acetone, World Petrochemicals report, January 2010fStylianos Sifniades, Alan B. Levy, \\"Acetone\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. It is a common building block in organic chemistry. Familiar household uses of acetone are as the active ingredient in nail polish remover and as paint thinner. It has volatile organic compound (VOC) exempt status in the United States. Acetone is produced and disposed of in the human body through normal metabolic processes. It is normally present in blood and urine. People with diabetes produce it in larger amounts. Reproductive toxicity tests show that it has low potential to cause reproductive problems. Ketogenic diets that increase ketone bodies (acetone, Œ≤-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid) in the blood are used to counter epileptic attacks in infants and children who suffer from refractory epilepsy. History Acetone was first produced by Andreas Libavius in 1606 by distillation of Lead(II) acetate. From p. 123: \\"QUINTA ESSENTIA PLUMBI.

Johann Josef Loschmidt had presented the structure of acetone in 1861,Loschmidt, J.

During World War I, Chaim Weizmann developed the process for industrial production of acetone (Weizmann Process).Chaim Weizmann. chemistryexplained.com Production In 2010, the worldwide production capacity for acetone was estimated at 6.7 million tonnes per year. With 1.56 million tonnes per year, the United States had the highest production capacity, followed by Taiwan and mainland China. The largest producer of acetone is INEOS Phenol, owning 17% of the world's capacity, with also significant capacity (7‚Äì8%) by Mitsui, Sunoco and Shell in 2010. INEOS Phenol also owns the world's largest production site (420,000 tonnes/annum) in Beveren (Belgium).

Retrieved on 2012-11-26. =Current method= Acetone is produced directly or indirectly from propylene. Approximately 83% of acetone is produced via the cumene process; as a result, acetone production is tied to phenol production. In the cumene process, benzene is alkylated with propylene to produce cumene, which is oxidized by air to produce phenol and acetone: :Overview of the cumene process Other processes involve the direct oxidation of propylene (Wacker-Hoechst process), or the hydration of propylene to give 2-propanol, which is oxidized (dehydrogenated) to acetone. =Older methods= Previously, acetone was produced by the dry distillation of acetates, for example calcium acetate in ketonic decarboxylation. : Ca(CH3COO)2 ‚Üí CaO(s) \\\\+ CO2(g) \\\\+ (CH3)2CO (v) After that time, during World War I, acetone was produced using acetone- butanol-ethanol fermentation with Clostridium acetobutylicum bacteria, which was developed by Chaim Weizmann (later the first president of Israel) in order to help the British war effort, in the preparation of Cordite. This acetone- butanol-ethanol fermentation was eventually abandoned when newer methods with better yields were found. Chemical properties =Keto/enol tautomerism= Like most ketones, acetone exhibits the keto‚Äìenol tautomerism in which the nominal keto structure of acetone itself is in equilibrium with the enol isomer (prop-1-en-2-ol). In acetone vapor at ambient temperature, only 2.4% of the molecules are in the enol form. Yet the enol form is chemically important in some chemical reactions. :300px =Aldol condensation= In the presence of suitable catalysts, two acetone molecules also combine to form the compound diacetone alcohol , which on dehydration gives mesityl oxide . This product can further combine with another acetone molecule, with loss of another molecule of water, yielding phorone and other compounds. =Polymerisation= One might expect acetone to also form polymers and (possibly cyclic) oligomers of two types. In one type, units could be acetone molecules linked by ether bridges derived by from the opening of the double bond, to give a polyketal- like (PKA) chain [‚Äì‚Äì]n. The other type could be obtained through repeated aldol condensation, with one molecule of water removed at each step, yielding a poly(methylacetylene) (PMA) chain [‚Äì‚Äì]n. PKA type The conversion of acetone to a polyketal (PKA) would be analogous to the formation of paraformaldehyde from formol, and of trithioacetone from thioacetone. In 1960, Kargin, Kabanov and others observed that the thermodynamics of this process is unfavourable for liquid acetone, so that it (unlike thioacetone and formol) is not expected to polymerise spontaneously, even with catalysts. However, they observed that the thermodynamics became favourable for crystalline solid acetone at the melting point (‚àí96 ¬∞C). They claimed to have obtained such a polymer (a white elastic solid, soluble in acetone, stable for several hours at room temperature) by depositing vapor of acetone, with some magnesium as a catalyst, onto a very cold surface.V. A. Kargin, V. A. Kabanov, V. P. Zubov, I. M. Papisov (1960): \\"Polymerisation of acetone\\". Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, volume 134, issue 5, pages 1098‚Äì1099. In 1962, Wasaburo Kawai reported the synthesis of a similar product, from liquid acetone cooled to ‚àí70 to ‚àí78 ¬∞C, using n-butyl lithium or triethylaluminium as catalysts. He claimed that the infrared absorption spectrum showed the presence of linkages but no groups. However, conflicting results were obtained later by other investigators. Structure of possible acetone polymer PMA type The PMA type polymers of acetone would be equivalent to the product of polymerisation of propyne, except for a keto end group. Biochemistry =Biosynthesis= Small amounts of acetone are produced in the body by the decarboxylation of ketone bodies. Certain dietary patterns, including prolonged fasting and high-fat low- carbohydrate dieting, can produce ketosis, in which acetone is formed in body tissue. Certain health conditions, such as alcoholism and diabetes, can produce ketoacidosis, uncontrollable ketosis that leads to a sharp, and potentially fatal, increase in the acidity of the blood. Since it is a byproduct of fermentation, acetone is a byproduct of the distillery industry. Acetone can be produced from the oxidation of ingested isopropanol, or from the spontaneous/enzymatic breakdown of acetoacetate (a ketone body) in ketotic individuals. =Metabolism= Although some biochemistry textbooks and current research publications indicate that acetone cannot be metabolized, there is evidence to the contrary. It can then be metabolized either by CYP2E1 via methylglyoxal to D-lactate and pyruvate, and ultimately glucose/energy, or by a different pathway via propylene glycol to pyruvate, lactate, acetate (usable for energy) and propionaldehyde. Uses =Industrial= About a third of the world's acetone is used as a solvent, and a quarter is consumed as acetone cyanohydrin, a precursor to methyl methacrylate. Solvent Acetone is a good solvent for many plastics and some synthetic fibers. It is used for thinning polyester resin, cleaning tools used with it, and dissolving two-part epoxies and superglue before they harden. It is used as one of the volatile components of some paints and varnishes. As a heavy-duty degreaser, it is useful in the preparation of metal prior to painting or soldering, and to remove rosin flux after soldering (to prevent adhesion of dirt and electrical leakage and perhaps corrosion or for cosmetic reasons), although it attacks many electronic components (for example polystyrene capacitors) so it is unsuitable for cleaning many circuit boards. Acetylene carrier Although itself flammable, acetone is used extensively as a solvent for the safe transportation and storage of acetylene, which cannot be safely pressurized as a pure compound. Vessels containing a porous material are first filled with acetone followed by acetylene, which dissolves into the acetone. One litre of acetone can dissolve around 250 litres of acetylene at a pressure of 10 bar.Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) ‚Äì Safety Hazard Information ‚Äì Special Hazards of Acetylene .

It begins with the initial conversion of acetone to acetone cyanohydrin: :(CH3)2CO + HCN ‚Üí (CH3)2C(OH)CN In a subsequent step, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to the unsaturated amide, which is esterified: :(CH3)2C(OH)CN + CH3OH ‚Üí CH2=(CH3)CCO2CH3 \\\\+ NH3 The third major use of acetone (about 20%) is synthesizing bisphenol A. Bisphenol A is a component of many polymers such as polycarbonates, polyurethanes, and epoxy resins. The synthesis involves the condensation of acetone with phenol: :(CH3)2CO + 2 C6H5OH ‚Üí (CH3)2C(C6H4OH)2 \\\\+ H2O Many millions of kilograms of acetone are consumed in the production of the solvents methyl isobutyl alcohol and methyl isobutyl ketone. These products arise via an initial aldol condensation to give diacetone alcohol. :2 (CH3)2CO ‚Üí (CH3)2C(OH)CH2C(O)CH3 Condensation with acetylene gives 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol, precursor to synthetic terpenes and terpenoids. =Laboratory= Chemical research In the laboratory, acetone is used as a polar, aprotic solvent in a variety of organic reactions, such as SN2 reactions. The use of acetone solvent is critical for the Jones oxidation. It does not form an azeotrope with water (see azeotrope tables).What is an Azeotrope?. Solvent‚Äîrecycling.com. Retrieved on 2012-11-26. It is a common solvent for rinsing laboratory glassware because of its low cost and volatility. Despite its common use as a supposed drying agent, it is not effective except by bulk displacement and dilution. Acetone can be cooled with dry ice to ‚àí78 ¬∞C without freezing; acetone/dry ice baths are commonly used to conduct reactions at low temperatures. Acetone is fluorescent under ultraviolet light, and its vapor can be used as a fluorescent tracer in fluid flow experiments. Acetone is used to precipitate proteins. Alternatives for protein precipitation are trichloroacetic acid or ethanol. Cleaning Low-grade acetone is also commonly used in academic laboratory settings as a glassware rinsing agent for removing residue and solids before a final wash. Acetone leaves a small amount of residue on a surface when dried that is harmful to surface samples. Low-temperature bath A mixture of acetone and dry ice is a popular cooling bath that maintains a temperature of ‚àí78 ¬∞C as long as there is some dry ice left. Histology Acetone is used in the field of pathology to find lymph nodes in fatty tissues for tumor staging (such as looking for lymph nodes in the fat surrounding the intestines). This helps dissolve the fat, and hardens the nodes, making finding them easier. Acetone also used for destaining microscope slides of certain stains. Lewis base properties Acetone is a weak Lewis base that forms adducts with soft acids like I2 and hard acids like phenol. Acetone also forms complexes with divalent metals. Acetone is a weak Lewis base. =Medical= Drug solvent and excipient Acetone is used as a solvent by the pharmaceutical industry and as a denaturant in denatured alcohol. Acetone is also present as an excipient in some pharmaceutical drugs.Inactive Ingredient Search for Approved Drug Products, FDA/Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Skin defatting Dermatologists use acetone with alcohol for acne treatments to chemically peel dry skin. Common agents used today for chemical peeling are salicylic acid, glycolic acid, 30% salicylic acid in ethanol, and trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Prior to chemexfoliation, the skin is cleaned and excess fat removed in a process called defatting. Acetone, Septisol, or a combination of these agents is commonly used in this process. Anticonvulsant Acetone has been shown to have anticonvulsant effects in animal models of epilepsy, in the absence of toxicity, when administered in millimolar concentrations. It has been hypothesized that the high-fat low- carbohydrate ketogenic diet used clinically to control drug-resistant epilepsy in children works by elevating acetone in the brain. Because of their higher energy requirements, children have higher acetone production than most adults ‚Äì and the younger the child, the higher the expected production. This indicates that children are not uniquely susceptible to acetone exposure. External exposures are small compared to the exposures associated with the ketogenic diet. =Domestic and other niche uses= Acetone is often the primary component in cleaning agents such as nail polish and superglue removers. It will attack some plastics, however. Make-up artists use acetone to remove skin adhesive from the netting of wigs and mustaches by immersing the item in an acetone bath, then removing the softened glue residue with a stiff brush. Acetone is often used for vapor polishing of printing artifacts on 3D-printed models printed with ABS plastic. The technique, called acetone vapor bath smoothing, involves placing the printed part in a sealed chamber containing a small amount of acetone, and heating to around 80 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes. This creates a vapor of acetone in the container. The acetone condenses evenly all over the part, causing the surface to soften and liquefy. Surface tension then smooths the semi-liquid plastic. When the part is removed from the chamber, the acetone component evaporates leaving a glassy-smooth part free of striation, patterning, and visible layer edges, common features in untreated 3D printed parts.\\"Quality Finish 3D Prints with Acetone\\". instructables.com Safety =Flammability= The most hazardous property of acetone is its extreme flammability. Acetone burns with yellow bright flames. At temperatures greater than acetone's flash point of , air mixtures of between 2.5% and 12.8% acetone, by volume, may explode or cause a flash fire. Vapors can flow along surfaces to distant ignition sources and flash back. Static discharge may also ignite acetone vapors, though acetone has a very high ignition initiation energy point and therefore accidental ignition is rare. Even pouring or spraying acetone over red-glowing coal will not ignite it, due to the high concentration of vapour and the cooling effect of evaporation of the liquid.Acetone MSDS.

Also, industrial acetone is likely to contain a small amount of water which also inhibits ignition. =Acetone peroxide= When oxidized, acetone forms acetone peroxide as a byproduct, which is a highly unstable, primary high explosive compound. It may be formed accidentally, e.g. when waste hydrogen peroxide is poured into waste solvent containing acetone. Due to its instability, it is rarely used, despite its simple chemical synthesis. =Toxicity= Acetone has been studied extensively and is believed to exhibit only slight toxicity in normal use. There is no strong evidence of chronic health effects if basic precautions are followed.Basic Information on Acetone. Ccohs.ca (1999-02-19). Retrieved on 2012-11-26. It is generally recognized to have low acute and chronic toxicity if ingested and/or inhaled. Acetone is not currently regarded as a carcinogen, a mutagenic chemical nor a concern for chronic neurotoxicity effects. Acetone can be found as an ingredient in a variety of consumer products ranging from cosmetics to processed and unprocessed foods. Acetone has been rated as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substance when present in beverages, baked foods, desserts, and preserves at concentrations ranging from 5 to 8 mg/L. Acetone is however an irritant, causing mild skin irritation and moderate to severe eye irritation. At high vapor concentrations, it may depress the central nervous system like many other solvents. Acute toxicity for mice by ingestion (LD50) is 3 g/kg, and by inhalation (LC50) is 44 g/m3 over 4 hours.Safety (MSDS) data for propanone . sciencelab.com/msds. Retrieved on 2018-03-19 =EPA Classification= In 1995, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed acetone from the list of \\"toxic chemicals\\" maintained under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA). In making that decision, EPA conducted an extensive review of the available toxicity data on acetone and found that acetone \\"exhibits acute toxicity only at levels that greatly exceed releases and resultant exposures\\", and further that acetone \\"exhibits low toxicity in chronic studies\\". * Genotoxicity. Acetone has been tested in more than two dozen in vitro and in vivo assays. These studies indicate that acetone is not genotoxic. * Carcinogenicity. EPA in 1995 concluded, \\"There is currently no evidence to suggest a concern for carcinogenicity\\". (EPCRA Review, described in Section 3.3). NTP scientists have recommended against chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity testing of acetone because \\"the prechronic studies only demonstrated a very mild toxic response at very high doses in rodents\\". * Neurotoxicity and Developmental Neurotoxicity. The neurotoxic potential of both acetone and isopropanol, the metabolic precursor of acetone, have been extensively studied. These studies demonstrate that although exposure to high doses of acetone may cause transient central nervous system effects, acetone is not a neurotoxicant. A guideline developmental neurotoxicity study has been conducted with isopropanol, and no developmental neurotoxic effects were identified, even at the highest dose tested. (SIAR, pp. 1, 25, 31). * Environmental. When the EPA exempted acetone from regulation as a volatile organic compound (VOC) in 1995, EPA stated that this exemption would \\"contribute to the achievement of several important environmental goals and would support EPA's pollution prevention efforts\\". 60 Fed. Reg. 31,634 (June 16, 1995). 60 Fed. Reg. 31,634 (June 16, 1995). EPA noted that acetone could be used as a substitute for several compounds that are listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAP) under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. Environmental effects Although acetone occurs naturally in the environment in plants, trees, volcanic gases, forest fires, and as a product of the breakdown of body fat,Acetone, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ToxFAQs, 1995 the majority of the acetone released into the environment is of industrial origin. Acetone evaporates rapidly, even from water and soil. Once in the atmosphere, it has a 22-day half-life and is degraded by UV light via photolysis (primarily into methane and ethane.) Consumption by microorganisms contributes to the dissipation of acetone in soil, animals, or waterways. The LD50 of acetone for fish is 8.3 g/L of water (or about 1%) over 96 hours, and its environmental half-life in water is about 1 to 10 days. Acetone may pose a significant risk of oxygen depletion in aquatic systems due to the microbial consumption. Extraterrestrial occurrence On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the Philae lander on comet 67P surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate, and propionaldehyde.

State laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia and of the U.S. territories) vary considerably, and are independent of existing federal firearms laws, although they are sometimes broader or more limited in scope than the federal laws. State level laws vary significantly in their form, content, and level of restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.Liptak, Adam (June 28, 2010). \\"Justices Extend Firearm Rights in 5-to-4 Ruling\\", New York Times. Retrieved February 21, 2015. Firearm owners are subject to the firearm laws of the state they are in, and not exclusively their state of residence. Reciprocity between states exists in certain situations, such as with regard to concealed carry permits. These are recognized on a state-by-state basis. For example, Idaho recognizes an Oregon permit, but Oregon does not recognize an Idaho permit. Florida issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms, but others license only the concealed carry of firearms. Some states do not recognize out-of-state permits to carry a firearm at all, so it is important to understand the laws of each state when traveling with a handgun. In many cases, state firearms laws can be considerably less restrictive than federal firearms laws. This does not confer any de jure immunity against prosecution for violations of the federal laws. However, state and local police departments are not legally obligated to enforce federal gun law as per the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Printz v. United States. Common subjects of state laws Firearm related matters that are often regulated by state or local laws include the following: *Some states and localities require that a person obtain a license or permit in order to purchase or possess firearms. *Some states and localities require that individual firearms be registered with the police or with another law enforcement agency. *All states allow some form of concealed carry, the carrying of a concealed firearm in public. *Many states allow some form of open carry, the carrying of an unconcealed firearm in public on one's person or in a vehicle. *Some states have state preemption for some or all gun laws, which means that only the state can legally regulate firearms. In other states, local governments can pass their own gun laws more restrictive than those of the state. *Some states and localities place additional restrictions on certain semi-automatic firearms that they have defined as assault weapons, or on magazines that can hold more than a certain number of rounds of ammunition. *NFA weapons are weapons that are heavily restricted at a federal level by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986. These include automatic firearms (such as machine guns), short-barreled shotguns, and short-barreled rifles. Some states and localities place additional restrictions on such weapons. *Some states have enacted castle doctrine or stand-your-ground laws, which provide a legal basis for individuals to use deadly force in self-defense in certain situations, without a duty to flee or retreat if possible. *In some states, peaceable journey laws give additional leeway for the possession of firearms by travelers who are passing through to another destination. *Some states require a background check of the buyer when a firearm is sold by a private party. (Federal law requires background checks for sales by licensed gun dealers, and for any interstate sales.) *Some states have enacted red flag laws that enable a judge to issue an order to temporarily confiscate the firearms of a person who presents an imminent threat to others or to themselves.

He played as a midfielder but could also play as a defender between 1980 and 1997 notably for Portsmouth, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United. Webb also played for Reading, Swindon Town, Grimsby Town, Aldershot Town and Hong Kong side Instant-Dict.  Club career  =Reading= Webb joined Reading on leaving Little Heath School in 1979 and made his first-team debut in February 1980 at the age of 16. He became the youngest ever scorer for the Berkshire side when he found the net in a Third Division match at the beginning of the 1980-81 season. =Portsmouth= In July 1982 he transferred to Portsmouth for ¬£87,500. At Fratton Park he was a regular first-team player and helped them win promotion to the Second Division (as Third Division champions) in his first season, and in his third season they came close to reaching the First Division. He scored a total of 34 league goals in three seasons at Fratton Park. =Nottingham Forest= In June 1985, Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough paid Portsmouth ¬£250,000 for Webb, which took him into the First Division for the first time. At Forest he developed into a leading midfielder with a strong goalscoring record. During his time at the City Ground, he won the League Cup in 1989 (scoring in the final against Luton) and became a regular member of the England national team from 1987. Webb was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the Hillsborough disaster during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi- final against Liverpool in April 1989. His goalscoring record at Forest exceeded that of many strikers at the time. He managed 14 league goals in both of his first two seasons at the club, in 1986‚Äì87 from just 32 games. This included a hat-trick against Chelsea in September 1986 that sent him to the top of the League's scoring charts. He scored 13 times in the 1987‚Äì88 league campaign, though his goalscoring totally was lower in 1988‚Äì89 (six goals from 30 games) it did nothing to diminish his reputation as a first class midfielder. He scored for Forest against Luton Town in the 1989 Football League Cup Final which they went on to win. =Manchester United= In July 1989 he joined Manchester United. The transfer fee of ¬£1.5 million was determined by a transfer tribunal (Forest manager Brian Clough, reluctant for Webb to leave, offered to pay this to keep him). Webb scored on his league debut on 19 August 1989, when they achieved a 4‚Äì1 home win over defending league champions Arsenal on the opening day of the 1989‚Äì90 season. He joined United at a time when they were entering their fourth season under the management of Alex Ferguson, but had yet to win a major trophy under him in spite of heavy spending on new players ‚Äì with Webb arriving around the same time as Danny Wallace, Mike Phelan and Gary Pallister. After just a few games at United, Webb ruptured his achilles tendon while playing a match for England against Sweden in September 1989. Webb made his comeback for United as a substitute against Southampton on 24 March 1990, and made his first start since the injury the following Saturday, at home to Coventry City. Despite positive early indications - Reuters called him the \\"most influential player on the pitch\\" during a September 1990 clash with Luton Town \\\\- he never fully regained his pre-injury form, suffering from weight problems and other injuries. Webb was still a precise passer of the ball and was included in the England 1990 World Cup squad, having return to action during the second half of the 1989‚Äì90 season. He also helped Manchester United win the FA Cup in 1990, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, and Football League Cup in 1992. In the 1990 FA Cup final, he memorably hit a clinical 50-yard pass to Lee Martin who subsequently scored the winning goal in the FA Cup Final replay. He played in 31 out of 42 First Division games for Manchester United in 1991‚Äì92, but missed the final few games of the season due to a rift with manager Alex Ferguson ‚Äì some fans even blamed United's failure to win the league title that season on Webb. He famously dawdled off the pitch after being subbed in a 2-1 home defeat to Forest during the season's final stages. He was also faced with stiff competition for a place in the centre or on the right of midfield - as well as Bryan Robson and three midfielders who had joined United in 1989, he was now faced with competition from Soviet winger Andrei Kanchelskis. Webb only played one game for United in the new FA Premier League, and after months of media reports that he would be on his way out of Old Trafford, he finally left three months into the 1992-93 season. =Return to Forest= After three years with Manchester United, he returned to Nottingham Forest for ¬£800,000 on 23 November 1992. His second spell at Forest was unsuccessful, as he could not win a regular first-team place because of the emergence of other players like Steve Stone and Lars Bohinen. He made just nine league appearances in 1992‚Äì93 as Forest were relegated, but when manager Brian Clough retired and was succeeded by Frank Clark, he had more first team opportunities, playing 21 league games and scoring three goals as Forest were promoted back to the Premier League as Division One runners-up. Webb never played league football for Forest again after the 1994 promotion, though he remained contracted to the club for another two years. He had a spell on loan back at Reading in the 1995‚Äì96 season before finally leaving Forest for good in the summer of 1996. =Late playing career= He signed for Grimsby Town before leaving shortly after the start of the 1996-97 season, ending his professional career at the age of 33. He then joined non-league Aldershot Town where he made 36 appearances and scored 6 goals in the Isthmian League, before joining Weymouth as player-coach in 1997. In a 2005 vote to compile the Royals' best-ever eleven, Webb was voted on the team in central midfield.  International career  = Football League XI = After excelling in his first two seasons of top flight football with Nottingham Forest, Webb earned recognition from England manager Bobby Robson, who selected him in the Football League XI for an exhibition match against a Rest of the World XI, on 8 August 1987. The match was in recognition of the League's centenary. Webb started the game, and was replaced by Osvaldo Ardiles. Webb was praised by The Glasgow Herald, who stated \\"the performance of Webb was outstanding\\", adding that he \\"frequently showed a sweet combination of close control and confidence\\" and predicting full England honours in the offing. = England = Robson gave Webb his full international d√©but, against West Germany on 9 September 1987 at the age of 24, becoming the 1,000th player to be capped by England. His first goal came against Turkey on 14 October that year, in an 8‚Äì0 victory at Wembley in a Euro 88 qualifier. He appeared in two of England's group games at Euro 88 (which all ended in defeat), but his next international appearance ‚Äì against Denmark in a friendly on 14 September 1988 ‚Äì he scored the only goal in the game at Wembley. On 3 June 1989, he scored the third international goal of his career with a 3‚Äì0 World Cup qualifier victory over Poland, again at Wembley. On 24 April 1990 Webb made his first appearance with the England B team, playing in the 2‚Äì0 win over the Czechoslovakia B team at Roker Park. Despite missing the bulk of the 1989‚Äì90 season at Manchester United with injury, he was included in England's 1990 World Cup squad and made his solitary appearance of the competition in the third place playoff defeat by Italy. Before the year was out he would become the first player to be sent off whilst on England duty in three years when he saw red for the England B team in a match against the full Algeria team. On 12 May 1992, he scored what would be his final goal for England in a 1‚Äì0 friendly win over Hungary in Budapest. He would make four more international appearances for England, the last coming on 17 June 1992 when England lost 2‚Äì1 to hosts Sweden in their final Euro 92 group game. Webb was capped 26 times in five years for the England team, and scored 4 goals.  Management career  After having to give up playing football, from June to December 1997 he was player-coach of Southern League Southern Division side Weymouth, but quit after just 70 days. His next spell in management with non- league Reading Town in 2001 was also short-lived.  After football  After Webb left Reading, he could occasionally be found selling programmes at Reading's Madejski Stadium. He became a postman and was featured in the Observer Sport Supplement in a \\"Where Are They Now?\\" feature and is currently working for a transport company. He is also a regular guest on Talksport. He also worked with The Score Television Network in Canada as their English football correspondent for their \\"Sportsworld\\" and \\"Footy Show\\" programs. He was on every Sunday, giving his opinion on the happenings of the Premier League and the world of football.  Personal life  Webb's ex-wife Shelley Webb became a TV presenter, becoming a real footballers' wives interviewee, and then wrote the book called Footballers' Wives. The couple have two sons, Luke and Josh, who both play football; Luke was most recently with Hereford United before being released, and Josh was with Walton and Hersham. Luke previously played with Arsenal Under-18s and Josh with Reading's youth teams.

The neighborhood is along Baltimore's outer harbor in the southeastern section of the city, roughly two miles east of Baltimore's downtown district and next to or near the neighborhoods of Patterson Park, Fell's Point, Highlandtown, and Brewers Hill. Canton is considered one of Baltimore's trendiest and vibrant neighborhoods, known for its family-friendly community, urban lifestyle and hot spot for the social scene. The inclusive neighborhood continues to see rapid growth as more development opportunities come into the area. Since the late 1990s, the neighborhood has undergone significant gentrification and has been ranked the 16th most-gentrified zip code in the nation from 2000‚Äì2016. History In 1785, Irish merchant John O'Donnell settled in Baltimore and began trading with merchants in the Chinese port of Guangzhou, then called Canton by English speakers. When O'Donnell purchased land, he named his plantation Canton. In the late 18th century, O'Donnell's land was sold off by his son Columbus O‚ÄôDonnell, William Patterson and Peter Cooper, and was developed by the Canton Company for the waterfront industry and blue-collar housing. A major feature of early Canton was Major David Stodder's shipyard, located at Harris Creek, with the most famous vessel being built the USS Constellation. During the early 19th century, European immigrants settled in the area. Welsh immigrants, primarily workers from South Wales, began settling in Baltimore in large numbers beginning in the 1820s. Welsh and Irish migrant workers composed a large portion of Baltimore's working class during the early and mid-1800s. In 1850, a large community of copper workers from Wales settled in the neighborhood. These workers established a Presbyterian church in 1865, located on Toone Street in Canton. Subsequent groups of immigrants have included Germans, Poles and Ukrainians. In the 2000s, as industry moved out, new housing and marinas have been developed along the waterfront and gentrification of the existing housing has occurred further inland. Boundaries Canton is bounded by Patterson Park and Eastern Ave to the north, Chester Street to the west, the waterfront to the south, and Conkling Street to the east. The streets are laid out in a uniform north to south and east to west directions, with the major exception of Boston Street, which runs along the Patapsco River waterfront. Transportation Canton is conveniently situated with easy access to Interstate 95, Interstate 895 and Boston Street and Eastern Avenues, which provide major surface routes to downtown Baltimore. Two high-frequency MTA bus lines (Gold and Navy) service Canton for direct access to the central business district and Penn Station. The south waterfront area provides a water taxi link to Locust Point. Bus transportation to New York City and Washington, D.C. is available with frequent service at a nearby Eastern Bus stop on Ponca Street. Landmarks Many of the structures are included in the Canton Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Canton's traditional center is O'Donnell Square, a small park bordered on the north and south by O'Donnell Street, to the east by South Potomac Street, and to the west by Linwood Avenue. O'Donnell Square is home to a number of lively bars and restaurants, gift shops, salons and other small businesses, as well as residences. Canton is also immediately adjacent to Patterson Park, a popular nearby attraction for local residents. In the 2000s, developments have added focus areas to the neighborhood, including the Canton Waterfront Park and Maryland Korean War Memorial, the rehabilitated American Can Company building, the Du Burns Soccer Arena, two marinas, a public boat launch, and new bars and restaurants. The Canton Dog Park, the first off-leash dog park in Baltimore, has been open for dog lovers since 2002. The neighborhood is home to the many food and wine festivals, Light Night Canton, Baltimore's annual Ukrainian-American festival, summer concert series, and is a popular destination to view Baltimore Harbor July 4th fireworks. A premier shopping complex, The Shops at Canton Crossing, anchored by Target and Nordstrom Rack, has been serving local residents since 2013. Notable churches in the area include the St. Casimir (Roman Catholic) Church, built c. 1926, the St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church, and the (Episcopal) Church on the Square. Enoch Pratt Free Library branch Canton‚Äôs branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimore‚Äôs first and in operation since 1866, is centrally located on O‚ÄôDonnell Square. A moored trash interceptor, the female-gendered Professor Trash Wheel (with appropriate googly eyes) can be found off the Boston Street Pier Park since December 2016. Housing stock Most houses in Canton are turn-of-the-20th-century two- to three-story rowhouses. Some homes closer to the waterfront date from the Civil War and many are well-preserved despite their age. New townhouses have recently been built at O'Donnell Square and throughout the neighborhood, replacing some of the previous stock. There are also luxury waterfront apartments and condominiums in recently rehabilitated industrial buildings. According to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance, the median price of homes sold in 2016 was $286,500, an increase from $231,000 in 2011. Demographics Based on data derived from the census of 2010 and 2014 ACS 5-year estimate, there were 11,398 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Canton was 90.8% White, 3.9% African American, 0.1% Native American, 2.3% Asian, 1.0% from other races, and 2.0% from two or more races. The median household income in 2016 was $103,282, the 2nd highest of all Baltimore neighborhoods, behind Roland Park. 88.1% of the working-age population is employed, 3.0% is unemployed, both rates highest and lowest, respectively, among all Baltimore neighborhoods.

It is a time to catch up, sip a cold beer and enjoy the cool of the evening. Instead of the roar of traffic, you are serenaded by the melodies of southern Gabon‚Äôs singing celebrity Annie-Flore Batchielillys, or at least a chorus of ardent local fans. Oysters are part of Mayesien life. Each dry season (June to September) salt water floods in from the ocean, turning the lagoon near Mayumba clear and salty. This has two exciting effects. First, the clear sea water cleans the oyster beds near the lagoon mouth, making this wonderful seafood deliciously palatable. Secondly, the greater water visibility permits locals to dive for oysters and take them back for sale at Mayumba‚Äôs market. Oysters are purchased alive or already cooked ‚Äòkebab‚Äô style. Visitors can even try their hand at diving for an oyster (the usual depth of the water is only 3 meters (10 feet)) after which the diving party retires to the beach front where the oysters are grilled in their shells on open fires. Mayumba is home to a very relaxed pace of life, but for those with energy to spare after a hard morning of tanning, swimming or sampling the local seafood, there are several good walks to be had in and around the town, with excellent views of the lagoon and the ocean. The seashore itself draws walkers like a magnet, and the wild coast to the immediate south of the town offers hiking limited only by your own stamina. Return home through the savannah for the chance to catch a glimpse of a rare bird or a sitatunga antelope.  Climate  Mayumba has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Aw).

ONE was founded in 2004 by Bobby Shriver and Bono along with a coalition of 11 non-profit humanitarian and advocacy organizations; those organizations included DATA, CARE, World Vision, Oxfam America, and Bread for the World. Funding was provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2007, ONE announced that it would be merging with DATA.  Overview  ONE advocates for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and for policies that benefit those who live in conditions of extreme poverty around the globe. ONE supports a broad variety of international development issues, including the fight against treatable and preventable diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; access to clean water and expanded access to energy; lessening corruption and improving transparency standards and government accountability to citizens; making trade fairer; providing basic education for all; and increasing international affairs budgets.  History  ONE was founded by Irish musician Bono and American attorney Bobby Shriver, along with 11 organizations: Bread for the World, CARE, DATA, International Medical Corps, International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps, Oxfam America, Plan USA, Save the Children U.S., World Concern, and World Vision. The name ONE was inspired by the belief that one voice, coming together with many others ‚Äî the political left and right, business leaders, activists, faith leaders and students ‚Äî can change the world for the better. = 2004‚Äì2010 = The official ONE launch rally was held on May 16, 2004, at Liberty Mall in Philadelphia, United States. Approximately 2,000 people attended, including Bono, Dikembe Mutombo, Michael W. Smith, Richard Stearns (president of World Vision), and David Beckmann (president of Bread for the World).

Lane\\"ONE Campaign and DATA to Merge\\" Press release from Data.org, October 27, 2007. until his departure in early 2011 to join the Obama administration. Former editor of Time magazine, CEO Michael Elliott, led ONE from 2011 until early 2016, and was ONE's Senior Strategic Advisor until his passing in July 2016. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the organization launched a campaign called ONE Vote '08. The campaign was co-chaired by former U.S. Senate majority leaders Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Bill Frist (R-TN). Since 2009, ONE has run a series of ONE Vote campaigns around national elections, including ONE VOTE 2010 in the United Kingdom, ONE Vote 2012 in both France, and ONE Vote 2012 and ONE Vote '16 in the United States.

In 2014, ONE's \\"Trillion Dollar Scandal\\" report was released. It suggested that $1 trillion leaves developing countries each year through various forms of corrupt activity. Since the release of the report, more than 50,000 people have signed a petition asking world leaders to sign up to the \\"Fair Play Standard\\" \\\\- a set of measures that would help promote transparency and reduce money flowing outwards as a result of corrupt activity. = 2015‚Äìpresent = In 2015, ONE collected signatures for an open letter addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa, respectively, in order to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that would establish new development goals for the generation. The following people signed the open letter: Ali Hewson, Angelique Kidjo, Beyonc√©, Charlize Theron, Christy Turlington, Danai Gurira, Helene Gayle, Lady Gaga, Lauren Bush, Mabel van Oranje, Dr. Maria Furtwangler, Meryl Streep, Michele Sullivan (president of the Caterpillar Foundation, director of Corporate Social Innovation), Naisula Lesuuda (senator, Kenya), Rita Wilson, Rosamund Pike, Sarah Silverman, Sheryl Sandberg, and Yvonne Chaka Chaka. In March 2015, ONE launched a report titled \\"Poverty is Sexist\\", which details the ways in which women and girls are most seriously affected by poverty. The promotion of this report included the release of the song and accompanying video ‚ÄòStrong Girl‚Äô which featured leading female musicians from seven African countries including Kenya's Victoria Kimani, South Africa's Judith Sephuma and Mozambique's Gambela, alongside Nigerian actress Omotola Jalade Ekeinde. It was nominated for ‚ÄòBest African Collaboration‚Äô in the All Africa Music Awards. The \\"Poverty is Sexist\\" campaign also encouraged women around the world to pose for a '#Strengthie' ‚Äì a selfie in the pose of Rosie the Riveter, face of the famous \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster ‚Äì and post it online in support of girls and women. Teenage activist and ONE campaign associate Malala Yousafzai posted a #strengthie from the Malala Campaign Twitter to show her support. On World AIDS Day, December 1, 2015, ONE and RED hosted a night of music at Carnegie Hall in New York to celebrate the 15 million people on life-saving anti-retroviral drugs compared to 700,000 in 2000, and to encourage the world to keep its focus on eradicating HIV/AIDS and other preventable diseases by 2030 as one of the Sustainable Development Goals. The event, which also marked ONE's 10 year anniversary, was hosted by The Daily Show‚Äôs Trevor Noah and featured performances from Miley Cyrus, Hozier, Jessie J, Bono and The Edge. During 2015, ONE worked with partners at Action/2015 and Project Everyone to promote the new Global Goals for Sustainable Development around the world so citizens can hold leaders to account in delivering them by 2030. On International Women's Day 2016, ONE relaunched their Poverty is Sexist campaign, featuring an updated report including new figures, such as the fact that in 2016 half a billion women still cannot read and that girls account for 74% of all new HIV infections among adolescents across Africa. It also lists the 20 worst countries to be a girl, based on a number of factors including the number of years a girl attends school, the proportion of women who have a paid job relative to men and the likelihood of a woman dying during childbirth. On International Women's Day 2017, ONE released a report that stated 130 million girls are currently out of school. It claims the number of girls missing out on receiving an education amounts to a crisis that must be urgently addressed. The campaign involved an open letter signed by several high-profile celebrity activists; including Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey, Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, Elton John, Colin Farrell, Mary J. Blige and Shonda Rhimes. The letter was addressed to world leaders, asking them to put women and girls at the top of the development agenda in order to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 as per the Sustainable Development Goals. It also asks for better data on females across the globe, to make sure the world can track the improvements being delivered to them. In March 2017, Gayle Smith was named president and CEO of the ONE Campaign.

ONE does not ask for public donations, stating: \\"We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.\\" ONE works with volunteer campaigners in different markets to raise awareness and lobby governments to fight extreme poverty and preventable disease. ONE Youth Ambassadors are selected yearly from Ireland, the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy to support its grassroots mobilization and advocacy goals across Europe. ONE Champions work to advance ONE's goals in Africa through lobby meetings, campaigning, and awareness raising. In the United States and Canada, ONE field organizers coordinate campaigning efforts, lobby members of Congress and Parliament, and host community awareness events. On college campuses across the U.S., ONE Campus chapters are run by students who mobilize their peers to participate in ONE's advocacy campaigns. ONE Campus chapters aim to teach students about extreme poverty and encourages members to campaign for lifesaving investments and US development policies. Legislation In the United States, ONE announced its support for the Electrify Africa Act of 2013 (H.R. 2548; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the President to establish a multiyear strategy to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa develop an appropriate mix of power solutions to provide sufficient electricity access to people living in rural and urban areas in order to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth. ONE Campaign said that \\"this legislation is a bold vision for U.S. engagement in the energy sector in Africa.\\" On February 8, 2016, the Electrify Africa Act was signed into law by President Obama. ONE Campaign members helped achieve this result by hosting events, signing and delivering petitions (360,000 names collected and delivered across all US states) and tweeting their support to politicians. Senator Chris Coons thanked ONE members for their support in helping raise the profile of the bill. ONE has worked with Publish What You Pay and a coalition of other non-government organisations around the Cardin- Lugar Amendment and the passing of extractives transparency laws in the United States and Europe. In 2014, over 22,000 UK-based ONE members wrote to their MPs in support of investing 0.7 of Gross National Income to international aid. In June, Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore used his Private Member's Bill to enshrine the law, making the UK the first G7 country to meet the UN spending target.  Controversy  ONE has been criticized for its response to a book by African economist Dambisa Moyo, Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa, which was published in January 2009. Moyo accused ONE of mischaracterizing her views. She says that she is against only government aid, not \\"their kind of aid\\". In June 2009 Dambisa Moyo told former U.S. presidential Republican speech writer Peter Robinson during a Hoover Institute sponsored Uncommon Knowledge interview that \\"the harshest thing that has happened [in terms of responses to her 2009 book Dead Aid], Bono's and Bob Geldof's organization, called ONE, who I had tried to have a number of meetings with before the book came out, about what the theses of the book were, launched a very vitriolic attack against me. To the point that they were calling organizations ahead of my meetings and media appointments and sent a letter to African NGOs claiming, basically, painting me as a genocidal maniac trying to kill African babies. In other words, trying to get Africans to be against me. To me, that was not really fostering dialogue.\\"\\"Africa with Dambisa Moyo\\" . Peter Robinson. Hoover Institute. June 12, 2009.

A majority of low-and-middle- income consumers rely on the quick access and cheap service of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in developing countries. A video clip of a vendor making churros in Colombia Today, people may purchase street food for a number of reasons, such as convenience, to get flavourful food for a reasonable price in a sociable setting, to try ethnic cuisines, or for nostalgia. Rising concerns of street food includes health hazards and sanitation issues, illegal usage of public or private areas, social and ethical problems, and traffic congestion. History Satay street vendor in Java, Dutch East Indies, c. 1870, using pikulan or carrying baskets using a rod The presence of street food vendors in New York City throughout much of its history, such as these circa 1906, are credited with helping support the city's rapid growth. Small fried fish were a street food in ancient Greece; however, Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low regard. Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was discovered during the excavation of Pompeii. Street food was widely consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes did not have ovens or hearths. Here, chickpea soup with bread and grain paste were common meals. In ancient China, street food generally catered to the poor, though wealthy residents would send servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their homes. A traveling Florentine reported in the late 14th century that in Cairo, people brought picnic cloths made of rawhide to spread on the streets and sit on while they ate their meals of lamb kebabs, rice, and fritters that they had purchased from street vendors. In Renaissance Turkey, many crossroads had vendors selling \\"fragrant bites of hot meat\\", including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted. In 1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and standardize street food. Aztec marketplaces had vendors who sold beverages such as atolli (\\"a gruel made from maize dough\\"), almost 50 types of tamales (with ingredients that ranged from the meat of turkey, rabbit, gopher, frog and fish to fruits, eggs and maize flowers), as well as insects and stews. Spanish colonization brought European food stocks like wheat, sugarcane and livestock to Peru, but most commoners continued to primarily eat their traditional diets. Imports were only accepted at the margins of their diet, for example, grilled beef hearts sold by street vendors. Some of Lima's 19th- century street vendors such as \\"Erasmo, the 'negro' sango vendor\\" and Na Aguedita are still remembered today. During the American Colonial period, \\"street vendors sold oysters, roasted corn ears, fruit, and sweets at low prices to all classes.\\" Oysters, in particular, were a cheap and popular street food until around 1910 when overfishing and pollution caused prices to rise. Street vendors in New York City faced a lot of opposition. After previous restrictions had limited their operating hours, street food vendors were completely banned in New York City by 1707. Many women of African descent made their living selling street foods in America in the 18th and 19th centuries, with products ranging from fruit, cakes, and nuts in Savannah, to coffee, biscuits, pralines, and other sweets in New Orleans. Cracker Jack started as one of many street food exhibits at the Columbian Exposition. In the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold gingerbread-nuts, cream mixed with corn, as well as bacon and other meat fried on top of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside. French fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a street food in Paris in the 1840s. Street foods in Victorian London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns, and jellied eels. Mumbai, India has more than a half a million of street food vendors. A whole street taken up by street food vendors during the Yasothon Rocket Festival in Thailand Street food culture in China was first developed in the Tang Dynasty and continued to evolve over millennia. Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary tourism. Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced the concept of a street food culture to other countries. The street food culture of Southeast Asia was established by coolie workers imported from China during the late 19th century. Ramen, originally brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants about 100 years ago, began as a street food for laborers and students. However, it soon became a \\"national dish\\" and even acquired regional variations. In Thailand, street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of Thailand. It did not become popular among native Thai people until the early-1960s when, due to urban population growth and rising incomes, it had \\"displaced home-cooking.\\" About 76% of urban residents in Thailand regularly visit street food vendors. The rise of the country's tourism industry has also contributed to the popularity of Thai street food. Thailand's 103,000 street food vendors alone generated 270 billion baht in revenues in 2017. Suvit Maesincee, Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, expects the Thai street food segment to grow by six to seven percent annually from 2020 forward. Multiple studies showed that contamination of food that street food vendors sell is at the same level as the contamination at restaurants. Street vendors of Bangkok today feed 40% of population of that city. In Indonesia ‚Äî especially Java, travelling food and drink vendor has a long history, as they were described in temples bas reliefs dated from 9th century, as well as mentioned in 14th century inscription as a line of work. In Indonesia, street food is sold from carts and bicycles.During colonial Dutch East Indies period circa 19th century, several street food were developed and documented, including satay and dawet (cendol) street vendors. The current proliferation of Indonesia's vigorous street food culture is contributed by the massive urbanization in recent decades that has opened opportunities in food service sectors. This took place in the country's rapidly expanding urban agglomerations, especially in Greater Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya. Some cultures consider rude walking on the street while eating. Around the world Porilainen, a Finnish burger- like sandwich Food carts lining a street in Jakarta, Indonesia, selling street foods Street food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly between regions and cultures. For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being \\"fresh and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area\\" and \\"draw[ing] heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime\\", while street food of Thailand is \\"fiery\\" and \\"pungent with shrimp paste ... and fish sauce.\\" New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, but New York street food also includes everything from \\"spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles\\" Falafel is very popular in the Middle East as fast food. Vendors sell it on the street concers is most popular in countries like Israel, Egypt, and Syria. Falafel is also the national dish of Israel. Falafel is a deep-fried ball or patty that is made from chickpeas or fava beans and spices. It is a favorite among vegetarians. Jamaican Jerk Chicken is a traditional dish served in the Caribbean Islands. The original marinade demands authentic Caribbean ingredients such as scotch bonnet peppers, allspice berries and sometimes, wood from laurel trees.Grilled bread with jam served with sweetened milk in Bangkok Street food in Thailand offers various selection of ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks sold by hawkers or vendors at food stalls or food carts on the street side. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best places for street food. Popular street offerings includes pad thai (stir fried rice noodle), som tam (green papaya salad), sour tom yum soup, various selection of Thai curries, to sticky rice mango Indonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese, and Dutch influences. Indonesian street food often tastes rather strong and spicy. A lot of street food in Indonesia are fried, such as local gorengan (fritters), also nasi goreng and ayam goreng, while bakso meatball soup, skewered chicken satay and gado-gado vegetable salad served in peanut sauce are also popular. Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every place has its own specialties to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes are Vada pav, Misal pav, Chole bhature, Parathas, Bhel Puri, Sev Puri, Gol Gappa, Aloo tikki, Kebabs, Tandoori chicken, Samosa, Kachori, rolls, Idli, pohe, Bread omelette, Egg bhurji, Pav bhaji, pulaw, kachchhi dabeli, Pakora, bhutta, barf gola, cold coffee, lassi, badam shake, Kulfi, and Falooda. In Hindi speaking regions of India, street food is popularly known as nukkadwala food (\\"corner\\" food). In South India, foods like Mirchi Bajji, Punugulu, Chitti Garelu/Mini Vada,Chicken Pakodi, Mokkajonna (Corn roasted on coal) are famous street foods along with breakfast items like Idli, Vada, Dosa, Poori, Bonda etc. While some vendors streamline the recipes of popular dishes to sell them on the street, several restaurants have taken their inspiration from the vibrant street food of India. Street food in Hyderabad, Telangana, India In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of \\"plate lunch\\" (rice, macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the bento of the Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers. In Denmark, sausage wagons allow passersby to purchase sausages and hot dogs. In Egypt, a food sold commonly on the street is ful, a slow-cooked fava bean dish. Mexican street food is known as \\"antojitos\\" (translated as \\"little cravings\\") which include several varieties of tacos, such as tacos al pastor, huaraches and other maize based foods There is a stigma in Japan that is against eating on the move. However, during special occasions such as festivals, the streets of Tokyo are filled with vendors that serve food such as odango, sashimi, oyster, and octopus. Cultural and economic aspects Street vendor of snack foods in Nepal Because of differences in culture, social stratification and history, the ways in which family street vendor enterprises are traditionally created and run vary in different areas of the world. Often, women's success in the street food market depends on trends of gender equality. This is evidenced in Bangladesh, where few women are street vendors. However, in Nigeria and Thailand, women dominate the street food trade. Doreen Fernandez says that Filipino cultural attitudes towards meals is one \\"cultural factor operating in the street food phenomenon\\" in the Philippines because eating \\"food out in the open, in the market or street or field\\" is \\"not at odds with the meal indoors or at home\\" where \\"there is no special room for dining\\". Other cultural phenomenon that affect the street food market depend on the cultural implications of walking down the street. In some cultures, this is considered to be rude, such as Japanese or Swahili cultures. Despite not being allowed for adults, it is culturally acceptable for children to do. In India, Henrike Donner wrote about a \\"marked distinction between food that could be eaten outside, especially by women,\\" and the food prepared and eaten at home, with some non-Indian food being too \\"strange\\" or tied too closely to non-vegetarian preparation methods to be made at home. In Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce economic benefits beyond their families. Because street food vendors purchase local fresh foods, urban gardens and small-scale farms in the area have expanded. In the United States, street food vendors are credited with supporting New York City's rapid growth by supplying meals for the city's merchants and workers. Proprietors of street food in the United States have had a goal of upward mobility, moving from selling on the street to their own shops. However, in Mexico, an increase in street vendors has been seen as a sign of deteriorating economic conditions in which food vending is the only employment opportunity that unskilled labor who have migrated from rural areas to urban areas are able to find. In 2002, Coca-Cola reported that China, India, and Nigeria were some of its fastest-growing markets: markets where the company's expansion efforts included training and equipping mobile street vendors to sell its products. The libertarian Reason magazine states that in US, cities, food trucks are subject to regulations designed to prevent them from competing with bricks and mortar restaurants. For example, in Chicago, a regulation prevents food trucks \\"...from selling food within 200 feet of brick-and-mortar restaurants and, hence, prohibit them from operating throughout the city's downtown area\\", which critics have called an \\"anti- competitive\\" rule for food truck operators. Since 1984, Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco is home of one of the most diverse street food fair. In addition to much leather, and people in various states of dress and undress, the event features an outdoor food court serving a variety of street food. For $10 or more donations visitors get $2 discount for each drink purchased at the fair. In 2018, the street photographer Michael Rababy documented on his book, Folsom Street Food Court, the world infamous street food festival Folsom Street Fair. Netflix has also featured the street foods of the world through its popular tv series Street Food, with the first volume focusing on Asia, and second volume on Latin America. Health and safety As early as the 14th century, government officials oversaw street food vendor activities. With the increasing pace of globalization and tourism, the safety of street food has become one of the major concerns of public health, and a focus for governments and scientists to raise public awareness. However, despite concerns about contamination at street food vendors, the incidence of such is low, with studies showing rates comparable to restaurants. In 2002, a sampling of 511 street foods in Ghana by the World Health Organization showed that most had microbial counts within the accepted limits, and a different sampling of 15 street foods in Calcutta showed that they were \\"nutritionally well balanced\\", providing roughly 200 kcal (Cal) of energy per rupee of cost. In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency has provided comprehensive guidance of food safety for the vendors, traders and retailers of the street food sector since 2000. Other effective ways of enhancing the safety of street foods include: mystery shopping programs, training, rewarding programs to vendors, regulatory governing and membership management programs, and technical testing programs. Despite knowledge of the risk factors, actual harm to consumers‚Äô health is yet to be fully proven and understood. Due to difficulties in tracking cases and the lack of disease-reporting systems, follow-up studies proving actual connections between street food consumption and food-borne diseases are still very few. Little attention has been devoted to consumers and their eating habits, behaviors and awareness. The fact that social and geographical origins largely determine consumers‚Äô physiological adaptation and reaction to foods‚Äîwhether contaminated or not‚Äîis neglected in the literature.MARRAS S.R. (2014). \\"Comparative Analysis of Legislative Approaches to Street Food in South American Metropolises.\\" In Cardoso R., Companion M., Marras S. (eds.). Street Food. Culture, Economy, Health and Governance. London & NY: Routledge. Pp.15‚Äì45. In the late 1990s, the United Nations and other organizations began to recognize that street vendors had been an underused method of delivering fortified foods to populations, and in 2007, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization recommended considering methods of adding nutrients and supplements to street foods that are commonly consumed by the particular culture. New policies and regulations are made all the time to make sure each vendor is selling safe and healthy food to the rest of society. Street food is worldwide and the amount of different kinds of food trucks is never ending. Most street food vendors do not provide many healthy options on their menu, about 70% of vendors said they only have one item that is considered to be healthy on the entire menu. In some cities one may see one or more food trucks parked on every street. There are many varieties of trucks such as burgers, falafel, sandwiches, pizza, smoothies, and many more.

History The school was established in 1920, as part of the drive for improved education which arose out of the March 1st Movement. Its founder was Cha Mirisa (Ï∞®ÎØ∏Î¶¨ÏÇ¨, 1880-1955), an educator and leader of the Joseon Women's Education Society. At the time it was known as the Geunhwa Academy. Because the name Geunhwa (Í∑ºÌôî, ÊßøËä±) refers to the Korean national flower, it was changed to \\"Duksung\\" under pressure from Japanese authorities in 1938. Duksung was officially founded as a college, on the site of the Unhyeongung palace, in 1950. During this same year, on May, 17 Duksung Woman's Junior College was established. As well as, the opening of a department of Korean literature and a department of domestic science. Dr. Song Geum-seon took the office as the 1st president of the school. It became a four-year college in 1952. In 1984, the main campus was moved to its present location in Dobong-gu. The college became a university in 1987. =Founder: Ms. Cha Mirisa= 1880(Gojong 17) - 1955, a feminist and educator. Ms. Cha Mirisa (1880-1955), who was a devout Roman Catholic, organized 'Joseon Society for Women's Education' in 1920 with a view to providing educational opportunities to the women in Korea, lending a small chapel on 19 April of the year to start to run a night class to teach women. In October 1921, she established \\"Geunhwa Women's School\\" with the contributions collected from some lectures, assuming the office as a schoolmistress. She held lectures, musical concerts, plays, and bazaars to raise funds to maintain the school with no support from the Joseon Government-general or foreign missionaries. In February 1934, she established a foundation named Geunhwa School, inaugurated as a chief director. She expanded and developed further \\"Geunhwa Woman's School\\" into \\"Geunhwa Woman's Vocational School.\\" After this, due to the insistence of the Japanese imperialists that Geunhwa represents Korea's national flower of an althea, the name of the school was changed to \\"Duksung School.\\" As the nation restored its independency in 1945, she established a higher educational institution for woman - Duksung Woman's Junior College (presently Duksung Woman's University). Ms. Cha Mirisa was conferred posthumous honors as a Meritorious Person for National Independence (the Order of Merit for National Foundation, National Medal) in 2002, the year of 57th anniversary of the restoration of national independency. =School history= * Establishment of the school and development against suppressions from the Japanese Imperialists (1920-1944) * 1920.

Begun in March 1949, the unarmed prototype, 50-577, first flew on 22 December 1949, piloted by North American test pilot George Welch and was the first U.S. Air Force night fighter design with only a single crewman and a single engine, a J47-GE-17 with afterburner rated at static thrust. Gun armament was eliminated in favor of a retractable under-fuselage tray carrying 24 unguided Mk. 4 rockets, then considered a more effective weapon against enemy bombers than a barrage of cannon fire. A second prototype, 50-578, was also built, but the YF-95 nomenclature was short-lived as the design was subsequently redesignated YF-86D. Rocket tray The fuselage was wider and the airframe length increased to , with a clamshell canopy, enlarged tail surfaces and AN/APG-36 all-weather radar fitted in a radome in the nose, above the intake. Later models of the F-86D received an uprated J-47-GE-33 engine rated at (from the F-86D-45 production blocks onward). A total of 2,504 D-models were built. Operational history On 18 November 1952, F-86D 51-2945 set a speed record of . Captain J. Slade Nash flew over a three km (1.8 mi.) course at the Salton Sea in southern California at a height of only . Another F-86D broke this world record on 16 July 1953, when Lieutenant Colonel William F. Barns, flying F-86D 51-6145 in the same path of the previous flight, achieved .

It was transformed in 2011 with a $1.2 million landscape renovation designed by South Florida landscape architect Raymond Jungles. The new landscape showcases native Florida plants and trees including bromeliads, palms, cycad, orchids and many others. There is a Japanese garden, native garden and bio-swale, and water gardens including ponds, fountains, and a wetland with mangrove and pond apple trees. The renovation also expanded the Great Lawn area for corporate and social events, established a plant nursery and event plaza, and enhanced the night-time lights, entrance gate, and pathways. The Garden offers free admission and is open Tuesday to Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. History In 1962, the City of Miami Beach created the \\"Garden Center\\" on a vacant site opposite the Miami Beach Convention Center built in 1957. Operated then as a City park, the Garden was situated on the historic Collins Canal, an integral part of the beginnings of Miami Beach. In the early 1900s pioneer John S. Collins dug the canal to transport mangoes and avocados, then called alligator pears by boat to the Port of Miami from groves along what is now Pinetree Drive. In the 1920s pioneer Carl Fisher developed Lincoln Road, luxury hotels such as the Flamingo and the Nautilus with polo fields and golf courses. The Garden site was originally a golf course. By 1922 Miami Beach boasted the largest avocado and mango groves in the world, but Miami's agricultural roots wouldn't last much longer, sacrificed for the tourist trade. Tourism has long been a driving force in Miami Beach, but the City also experienced the impact of economic recessions, World Wars, and destructive hurricanes. The Garden had sadly deteriorated before the Art Deco renaissance of the 1980s and after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. A group of residents approached the City in 1996 to create the Miami Beach Garden Conservancy as a non-profit organization with a mission to restore the Garden. Today's Miami Beach Botanical Garden is a public/private partnership, owned by the City of Miami Beach. The Garden has again become a dynamic venue for arts and cultural programming, environmental education and cultural tourism.Florida Federation of Garden Clubs, Inc. Mission The mission of the Miami Beach Botanical Garden is to promote environmental enjoyment, stewardship and sustainability through education, the arts, and interaction with the natural world. Our garden is a unique, subtropical oasis of beauty and tranquility within an urban setting‚Äîa community resource that refreshes, inspires and engages our visitors.Miami Beach Botanical Garden Miami Beach Garden Club The Miami Beach Garden Club is a non-profit organization affiliated with the Florida Federations of Garden Clubs. The organization promotes the cultivation of plants and flowers within the community through projects that focus on: beautification of Miami Beach; mentoring and sponsoring student programs both locally and statewide; and support of the Miami Beach Botanical Garden. The Miami Beach Garden club also works with local Girl Scouts and school children at multiple local schools by continuing to expand their knowledge through monthly programs.http://miamibeachgardenclub.com/ Japanese Garden One of the main features of the Miami Beach Botanical Garden is its Japanese Garden. This tranquil corner of the garden is defined by a red lacquered bridge spanning a quiet pond dotted with water lilies. Stone lanterns stand among the plantings based on the principles of Feng shui, where specific orientation and placing of certain elements helps to capture the energy and spirit of nature. Significant plantings here include the red powder puff shrub (Calliandra haematocephala), golden trumpet tree (Tabebuia caribea), and various types of tropical bamboo. Water Features Water is a focal point in all areas of the garden. According to the garden's landscape architect Raymond Jungles, the element of water is significant because it \\"brings the sky into the garden, animates the space, reflects the landscape, and cools the areas directly around the buildings. Water magnifies the garden's sense of scale.\\" Outside the offices is a refurbished fountain designed by Morris Lapidus. Beyond the fountain is the main pond with a cascading oolite fountain and flowering water lilies. The adjoining wetland contains red mangroves, pond apple trees (Annona glabra), and rush grasses. During the day you can see dragonflies, koi, and if you're lucky, one very shy turtle roaming the waters. Edible Garden The edible garden remains a reliable source of sustenance and natural beauty. It was made possible in part by the local chapter of Les Dames d'Escoffier: an international organization of women in the field of food, drink and gastronomy. This tropical edible garden contains pineapples (Ananas comosus), pomegranates (Punica granatum), coffee (Coffea arabica), and even raspberries. Often, the staff harvests fresh food and herbs from the garden to supplement workshops, mixers and other events.

He has been called the Father of Chinese Physics.  Early life and education  Wu was born in Panyu, Guangzhou (Canton) in the last years of the Qing dynasty. In 1929 he took his undergraduate degree at Nankai University in Tianjin (Tientsin). He moved to the United States for graduate schooling and obtained a Doctor of Philosophy Degree from the University of Michigan in 1933.  Career  Wu returned to China (then Republic of China) after receiving his doctorate degree, and between 1934 and 1949 he taught at various institutions there, including Peking University in Beijing, and National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming. In 1949, the year of the defeat of the Nationalists by the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Wu moved to Canada. There he headed the Theoretical Physics Division of the National Research Council until 1963. In the 1960s, he was Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University at Buffalo. After 1962, he held various positions in Taiwan (Republic of China), including the President of the Academia Sinica (1983‚Äì1994). He continued lecturing into his 90s and died on March 4, 2000. Wu's PhD dissertation dealt with theoretical predictions of the chemical properties of the yet undiscovered transuranic elements of the actinide series, which includes such well known elements as plutonium and americium. Later in his career, he worked on solid-state physics, molecular physics, statistical physics and other areas of theoretical physics. He was known as a teacher as much as a theoretician. His many illustrious students include Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, co-winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957. Wu wrote several books, best known of which are the monograph Vibrational Spectra and Structure of Polyatomic Molecules (1939) and the graduate level textbooks Quantum Mechanics (1986) and (as co-author) Relativistic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields (1991).

This is closely related to the fluctuation and interplay of the two polar energies, yin and yang and its cycle appeared in daily, yearly, and cosmically. 129,600 calendar years make up one Cosmic year and it was discovered by Shao Yung.  Daily cycle  The creative cycle can be seen in the passing of one day. At night, yin is at its strongest. The moon, darkness, stillness, and quietness all have yin nature. Night is a time of rest. When the sun, which has yang nature, rises, it is a time of birth. People tend to follow this flow of energy by sleeping at night and waking up in the morning. As the sun rises, yang becomes stronger and people tend to become more active. The afternoon is a time of growth. Eventually, yang reaches its highest peak, and from that point on, yin starts to regain its influence, and human activity starts to wind down. For many people, the evening is a time of relaxation and entertainment. This is the harvest in which they enjoy what they have worked for. Finally, yin becomes very dominant and things tend to return to the night time state of rest.  Yearly cycle  This process can also be seen in the cycle of one year. Heat is a manifestation of yang, and when the temperature rises in spring, sprouts break through the surface of the ground, dead yellow grass is replaced with new green grass, and new leaves appear on the trees. Spring is a time of birth. As summer approaches, yang continues to rise as yin diminishes. Things grow more rapidly and vegetation becomes lush. Summer is a time of growth. By the time autumn comes, yin has started to regain its influence. Autumn is a time of harvest when things come to fruition, and during autumn, as yin becomes more and more dominant, things return to the winter state of rest. Year after year this cycle repeats.  Cosmic cycle  According to Jeung San Do's teachings, the universe follows the cycle of birth-growth- harvest-rest (ÁîüÈï∑ÊÆÆËóè) or spring-summer-autumn-winter. This cycle, called the Cosmic Year, repeats every 129,600 calendar years, a number calculated by Chinese scholar Shao Yung. At the beginning and end of each cycle, the universe is in a yin state of dormancy called the cosmic winter. On our planet, this manifests as an ice age. As the yang energy regains its influence, the cosmic winter changes to spring and new life and a new human species appear on the earth. We call the current stage of humanity homo sapiens sapiens. The time of cosmic spring and summer is one of growth and diversity during which many cultures and civilizations develop. It is also a time of conflict. Cosmic autumn is a time of returning to oneness, a time in which humanity harvests its diverse experiences and accomplishments to create a global civilization of harmony. At any stage of the cosmic year, the position of the Earth's axis demonstrates the concurrent relationship between yin and yang. It is generally accepted that in the history of our planet there have been periodic changes in the Earth's poles, magnetism, and orbit.  Sudden change  What is left to debate is whether these changes occur gradually or suddenly. If we examine changes in nature during a calendric year, it becomes obvious that change occurs both suddenly and gradually. An example of this is the cherry blossom, which blooms in March. Gradually, over the course of a few months buds grow on the cherry tree, but suddenly, within a day or so, all of the flowers bloom at once. Finally, with just one strong wind or a heavy rain all of the blossoms fall.  Cosmic cycles in other traditions  In anthroposophy, based on teachings by Rudolf Steiner, a cosmic year represents the Platonic year, a period of 25,920 years. This is the time required for the Sun's position at spring equinox to traverse the complete zodiac. So each zodiacal sign covers about 2160 years. The year 747 BCE marked the transition from Taurus to Aries and since 1453, the spring equinoctial sun is in Pisces. This cosmic cycle has a considerable influence on humanity in both physical and spiritual respects. For instance, the Aries period covered the Greek/Roman culture period ranging from the foundation of Rome (753 BCE) to the fall of Byzantium (1453), whereas the Taurus period marked the Egyptian/Chaldaean era. Another example is human breathing rhythm: an average of 18 cycles per minute represents 18 x 60 x 24 = 25,920 cycles per day. The number of daily sleep-wake-cycles of the conscious mind in an average human lifetime of 72 years adds up to the same platonic figure. Shao Yung's cosmic year represents exactly five platonic years (5x25,920=129,600). Vedic scriptures delineate a cosmic cycle of creation and destruction marked by 4 Yugas. There is considerable debate on the duration of one Yuga, varying from 1200 to 432,000 or millions years. Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri estimates the duration of two total cycles (an descending and an ascending part) to comprise 24000 years. According to Vamadeva David Frawley the Yuga cycle relates to the precession of the equinoxes, thus suggesting a relationship with the platonic year. In the interpretations of these and other vedic scholars, modern times (1700‚Äì1900) have witnessed the end of the dark Iron Age (Kali Yuga), a notion supported by Rudolf Steiner.

Historically, the area was populated by gatherer-hunter-fishermen autochthons scattered in small villages around the Ndogo Lagoon and the Yenzi Lake. With the discovery in 1967 of a major oil field by Shell in the area, the town boomed and immigration of workers from various other parts of the country resulted in the population today of about 8000 people. Though production from the Gamba field is now only a fraction of what it once was, Gamba remains an important and strategic oil hub, being one of only two oil terminals in Gabon (the other one being Cape Lopez. Most people live in the heart of the town, divided into five blocks called ‚ÄúPlaines‚Äù, while most senior Shell staff live in Yenzi, half a dozen miles away from the heart of the city near the airport and the oil terminal. Balumbu people are known to be the autochthons of the region, even though the Punu and Fang people are now possibly the majority ethnic groups present. The name Gamba stands for fog in Vili, probably because of the foggy weather during the dry season. Gamba attracts many tourists from all over the world because of its remarkable biodiversity, and the proximity of Sette Cama and the Loango National Park. As a result of all that activity, life in Gamba is very expensive, and the ongoing economic crisis makes things more difficult for residents.

In the latter he categorized the Los Angeles experience into four ecological models (Surfurbia, Foothills, The Plains of Id, and Autopia) and explored the distinct architectural cultures of each. A frequent visitor to the United States from the early 1960s, he relocated there in 1976. Early life and education He was born in Norwich, England to Percy Banham, a gas engineer, and Violet Frances Maud Reyner. He was educated at Norwich School and gained an engineering scholarship with the Bristol Aeroplane Company, where he spent much of the Second World War. In Norwich he gave art lectures, wrote reviews for the local paper and was involved with the Maddermarket Theatre. In 1949 Banham entered the Courtauld Institute of Art in London where he studied under Anthony Blunt, Sigfried Giedion and Nikolaus Pevsner. Pevsner, who was his doctoral supervisor, invited Banham to study the history of modern architecture, following his own work Pioneers of the Modern Movement (1936). Career In 1952 Banham began working for the Architectural Review, having previously written regular exhibition reviews for ArtReview, then titled Art News and Review. Banham also had connections with the Independent Group, the 1956 This Is Tomorrow art exhibition ‚Äì considered by many to the birth of pop art ‚Äì and the thinking of the Smithsons and of James Stirling, on the 'New Brutalism', which he documented in his 1966 book The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic? But before this in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, he cut across mentor Pevsner's main theories, linking modernism to build structures in which the 'functionalism' was actually subject to formal structures. Later, he wrote a Guide to Modern Architecture (1962, later titled Age of the Masters, a Personal View of Modern Architecture). Banham predicted a \\"second age\\" of the machine and mass consumption. The Architecture of Well-Tempered Environment (1969) follows Giedion's Mechanization Takes Command (1948), putting the development of technologies such as electricity and air conditioning ahead of the classic account of structures. In the 1960s, Cedric Price, Peter Cook, and the Archigram group also found this to be an absorbing arena of thought. Green thinking (Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies) and then the oil shock of 1973 affected him. The 'postmodern' was for him uneasy, and he evolved into the conscience of postwar British architecture. He broke with utopian and technical formalism. Scenes in America Deserta (1982) talks of open spaces and his anticipation of a 'modern' future. In A Concrete Atlantis: U.S. Industrial Building and European Modern Architecture, 1900‚Äì1925 (1986) Banham demonstrates the influence of American grain elevators and \\"Daylight\\" factories on the Bauhaus and other modernist projects in Europe. =Teaching= As a professor, Banham taught at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London and the State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo from 1976 to 1980SUNY, School of Architecture and Planning, and through the 1980s at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He had been appointed the Sheldon H. Solow Professor of the History of Architecture at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University shortly before his death, but he never taught there. Awards and tributes He was featured in the short documentary Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles; in his book on Los Angeles, Banham said that he learned to drive so he could read the city in the original. In 1988 he was awarded the Sir Misha Black award and was added to the College of Medallists. Criticism In 2003, Nigel Whiteley published a critical biography of Banham, Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future, in which he gives an in-depth overview of Banham's work and ideas.

Great Opening ÈñãÈó¢ Jeungism calls a sudden change in culture, human and nature, Gaebyeok. Both syllables, gae (Èñã) and byuk (Èó¢), mean \\"to open.\\" The word comes from the Sino-Korean phrase cheon-ji-gae-byeok (Â§©Âú∞ÈñãÈó¢), which means \\"heaven opens and earth opens.\\" Cycle of gaebyeok Throughout a Cosmic Year there are major gaebyeoks and minor gaebyeoks. Every Cosmic Month (10,800 years) there is a minor gaebyeok accompanied by a minor but sudden shift of the Earth's axis. Every Cosmic Season (20,000-50,000 years) there is a major gaebyeok with a more dramatic shift in the Earth's axis. Gaebyeok can also mean a dramatic change within a person, such as a transformation in one's physical condition or a sudden spiritual awakening. Or gaebyeok can refer to a transformation in society. Critical moment According to Jeungism, humanity is now living near the end of the Cosmic Summer. The Cosmic Summer and Spring have been a time of growth, diversity, and conflict, but autumn will be a time of maturity, returning to oneness, and harmony. For this to happen, the Autumn Gaebyeok must take place on three levels: * Transformation of nature * Transformation of society * Transformation of each human being Pole shift The gaebyeok of nature will happen as automatically as the changing of seasons within a year, but the transformation of individuals and society is in the hands of humankind. Soon, the Earth's axis will shift perfectly upright, demonstrating the perfect balance between yin and yang in autumn, and the Earth's orbit around the sun will change to 360 degrees. These conditions will create a milder climate for the entire world. The time of equal yin and yang is a time of maturity and harmony. The Autumn Gaebyeok provides an opportunity for humanity to change along with nature and reach a harmonious and spiritually awakened existence. Obviously, a shifting of the Earth's axis will be a worldwide natural disaster, unprecedented in our written history. Global epidemic But, according to Jeung San Do, the world will be faced with an even greater challenge: global epidemic disease. With the supposed eradication of smallpox in the 1960s, we naively thought that humanity had conquered infectious disease, but in the last thirty years, one or two new infectious diseases have appeared each year, and old diseases have mutated, making them more and more difficult to treat. The potential for a catastrophic global disease already exists. Why global epidemic disease? The origin of the global disease is the accumulated suffering of humans. Because of the dominance of yang over yin in the cosmic spring and summer, conflict has been the mode of development. Humans have struggled to overcome nature and each other. Men have oppressed women, some races have oppressed others, and heaven has dominated earth. So many people have suffered and harbored inside them deep bitterness and grief. The energy of this bitterness and grief has accumulated and compounded over time and has turned into lethal energy. At the time of the Autumn Gaebyeok, this energy will be released as a global epidemic. Overcoming this outbreak of disease will be the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced and will be a catalyst for global unity. Jeungism calls this Euitong (ÈÜ´Áµ±), which means \\"to heal and unite.\\" The future Jeungic teachings are a combination of harsh realities and gentle love and concern. We are living at the end of the Cosmic Summer, a time marked by war, disease, and inequality, and we will soon be faced with tragedies on a global scale. But, the conflict and suffering of the Cosmic Summer is not without meaning and purpose. Spring exists for summer; summer exists for autumn. Overcoming conflict and suffering within one's life is a process of maturing for the individual. Overcoming the conflict and suffering of the Cosmic Spring and Summer is a process of maturing for humankind. The Cosmic Autumn is a time of peace, harmony, and enlightenment, the ultimate freedom from ignorance. We can already see the seeds of the autumn civilization, such as concern for the environment, the movement for equality between men and women, advances leading to greater longevity and quality of life and the movement for basic human rights for all people. In autumn the efforts of humanity come to fruition.

It lies on a peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gabon Estuary, across which boats sail to Libreville. It also lies near the Pongara National Park. Wildlife =Leatherback turtles= Point Denis is a major breeding ground for the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). Between 1 800 and 2 000 nests are laid annually on its beaches. Recent studies by Dr Sharon Deem, formerly of the Wildlife Conservation Society, note that the worldwide turtle population is being threatened by man's activities.Battle of the Beaches, Dr Sharon Deem, Africa Geographic magazine, February 2009 One such activity is the development of Point Denis. Turtles find their way to the sea by using the light from the moon shimmering off the water as a reference. Man-made artificial lights at night disorientate the female turtles during laying season as well as the hatchlings trying to find their way to the water. As a result, many turtles head off in the wrong direction and can die from starvation and dehydration.Artificial Lights as a Significant Cause of Morbidity of Leatherback Sea Turtles in Pongara National Park, Gabon, Sharon L. Deem et al. Marine Turtle Newsletter No. 116, 2007 Nests are also destroyed by visitors who drive vehicles, mainly quad bikes, on the beaches. Another problem is the pollution from the nearby town of Libreville. Turtles often mistake plastic bags in the water for jellyfish, their principal food source, and die if they ingest them. Nevertheless, there is a growing environmental movement in Gabon, protection of the turtles being one of their priorities. =Other species= Wildebeest are found in the area, as well as a diverse population of monkeys, birds, snakes and other reptiles.

The club was struggling with a debt of ¬£2,670 at the time. Davies was born in Tutbury, Staffordshire, the fifth of nine children of David Davies, a Welsh engineer from Mold, Flintshire, and Susannah Nield Davies, from Bunbury, Cheshire. He grew up in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester.1871 England Census1881 England Census1911 England CensusManchester, England, Marriages and Banns, 1754-1930 (Cathedral) He did not come from a wealthy family and initially worked as an estate agent and innkeeper.Barnes et al. (2001), p. 22. He first moved into the brewing business in the late 1890s as a director of John Henry Lees brewery in Moss Side (formed in 1897). By the beginning of the next century, he was chairman of the Walker and Homfray Brewery, and in 1904 he also became chairman of the Manchester Brewery Company, which owned many public houses in Manchester and Salford. Walker and Homfray took control of the Manchester Brewery and several other companies in 1912. Davies also gained control of Stockport-based Daniel Clifton & Company, which owned around 50 pubs and off-licences. In 1920, he founded the Moss Side Brewery Company and the Palatine Bottling Company.Richardson (1984), pp. 14‚Äì15. Before his involvement in football, he had become independently rich and had also married into another wealthy family. His wife Amy (n√©e Caterall) was the niece and ward of sugar merchant Sir Henry Tate. Davies and his wife became known as philanthropists and were noted for their support of other sports in the Manchester area. There is a popular story attached to how he came to take over Newton Heath. According to the story, the club captain Harry Stafford's dog (a St Bernard named Major) wandered away from the player at the club fund-raising bazaar at St James's Hall, Manchester in February 1901. Major was found by Davies, who returned him to Stafford. Davies asked if he could buy the dog, but instead ended up donating to the club. As a gesture of thanks, Stafford allowed him to keep the dog.Barnes et al. (2001), p. 19Excerpt from \\"The Title: The Story of the First Division\\" in The Guardian In March 1902, at a meeting in the New Islington Hall, Stafford announced to Newton Heath supporters that he, Davies and three other local businessmen had agreed to invest ¬£200 each in the club in order to save it after a winding-up order had been issued two months earlier.Kelly (1994), pp. 21‚Äì22. Under Davies's stewardship, the club changed its name to Manchester United FC and switched colours from white and navy to the now- famous red, white and black. Their Bank Street ground was upgraded to accommodate more supporters, and Ernest Mangnall was appointed secretary a year later. Players such as Alex Bell, Harry Moger, Charlie Roberts, George Wall and Charlie Sagar were brought into the club, and by 1906 United had been promoted to the First Division. They won the league in 1908 and the FA Cup in 1909 before Davies funded the move to a new ground at Old Trafford in 1910. A further league championship was won in 1911, but the ageing players, the loss of Mangnall to cross-town rivals Manchester City and the outbreak of the First World War brought an end to the club's first period of success on the pitch.Blundell (2006), p. 243.

Wun(Âéü) means \\"origin\\" or \\"primitive\\" and Shi(Âßã) means \\"beginning\\" or \\"start\\". Ban(Âèç) means \\"reverse\\" or \\"opposite\\" and Bon(Êú¨) means \\"origin\\" or \\"base\\". Its literal meaning is that returning to the origin.  How Unsibanbon appears in our daily life?  Before understanding Unsibanbon further, it is recommended that you understand both Cosmic year and Gaebyeok because Unsibanbon can be explained in more detail in the context of Cosmic year. The one constant in the universe is change, and at the time of the Autumn Gaebyeok, the direction of that change is returning to the origin. In our lives we often have the desire to return to our origins whether it means returning home after a long journey, discovering our ethnic and cultural roots, seeking the original purpose of our lives, or returning to the origin of life through meditation. The practice of returning to the origin is discovering who we truly are. It can also entail solving a problem at its root.  Why Unsibanbon is important?  According to the eastern philosophy, everything is changing and it has its own cycle. It is not difficult to find a cycle. Even our planet earth has its own cycle. Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. This cycle is divided with four different seasons, but the principle below is always yin and yang. When yang (positive energy) reaches its end, it must return to its origin. Just like a cannonball shot to the sky directly, it goes up to the sky and at a certain point, it returns to the ground. This action of return at the turning point is called Geukjeukban (ÂÖãÂçΩÂèç). As it is explained above, earth's four seasons can be contained in yin and yang. Spring and summer represent yang (positive energy) and autumn and winter represents yin (negative energy). When summer reaches its end (end of positive energy), just like a cannonball reaches its turning point, it returns to its origin from its farther-reached-end. This principle is important because Unsibanbon is happening regardless we acknowledge it or not. Also, it is important to accept and do our action with Unsibanbon this time of our life because it is natural like a shot cannonball returning to the ground from the sky. For this reason, many people meditate to be back to their origin.

Hae (Ëß£) means \\"release\\" or \\"solve\\" and wun (ÊÄ®) means \\"grudge\\" or \\"grief\\". Therefore, a literal meaning of haewun is resolution of bitterness and grief. Teachings of Haewun Throughout the ages, humans have suffered in the context of mutual conflict, and after death they have entered the spirit world, bearing bitterness and grief. Their bitterness and grief has accumulated over time and has turned into lethal energy. Not all people truly satisfied with their lives and live without bitterness and grief. Because of this bitterness and grief, people suffer and eventually they have grudge feeling toward each other. Therefore, more conflict and more lethal energy generated. This lethal energy is the destructive force behind misfortune and disaster. No one in the world ever tried to resolve the bitterness and grief, except Jeung San Sangjenim. Many sages, saints, and holymen attempted to resolve the bitterness and grief, but unable to accomplish this work. Resolving the bitterness and grief of spirits was a central focus of the spiritual work of Jeung San Sangjenim. Those who practice Jeung San Do are encouraged to refrain from harboring grudges or feelings of enmity and to avoid causing bitterness within others. Quotes from the Dojeon :The bitterness and grief of one person is enough to block the flow of qi in heaven and earth. :Dojeon 2:52:1 :Reflect on your own shortcomings first, and do not harbor feelings of enmity.

It is also one of the most important manganese mining towns in the world, under the auspices of the Compagnie Mini√®re de l'Ogoou√© (COMILOG), which began mining in 1957. Moanda has a population of around 39,298 inhabitants (2010 est.) World Gazetteer and is the second largest city in the Haut Ogoou√© Region, after Franceville. It is also a border town, lying 100 km away from the border with the Republic of Congo. History Moanda was originally a village lying on the swampy banks of the Miosso River. The discovery and exploitation of manganese in the nearby Bangombe Plateau from 1953 led to the emergence of the city. In 1977 Moanda had an estimated 230 million tons of manganese, some one-fifth of the world's deposits. In 1959, the 75 km COMILOG Cableway to the railway at Mbinda in the Republic of Congo was constructed to export the manganese, but it was eventually closed in 1986 when the Trans-Gabon Railway was completed. The city further grew during the 1990s owing to an influx of refugees from then war-torn Republic of Congo. Geography and climate Moanda lies on several adjacent plateaus lying between the higher and larger Bangombe plateau in the north, and the Miosso swamp in the south. Rocky formations Mount Boundinga and Mount Moanda lie further south. The climate is equatorial, with an alternation of thunderstorms and hot temperatures between January and March, and cool temperatures from July to September. Divisions Moanda is divided into three areas. The first area is built on the main plateau and its slopes and includes the commercial centre and populous districts Ankoula, Montagne Sainte and Fumier. The second area includes the most populous districts Alliance, Rio and L'Oasis. The third area is on the easternmost plateau and includes Lekolo and Leyima. Another plateau is home to Rigobert Landji High School, the largest high school in the city. Other districts include the Third Zone in the southwest, and the Mukaba District, on the slopes of the Bangombe Plateau. Economy Rhodochrosite from a Moanda mine On 24 April 1953 a joint corporation was established to mine a deposit estimated at 50 million tons of manganese ore in Gabon owned by the Bureau of Mines of Overseas France (21%), Eastern Tjbangi Mining Company (15%), Soci√©t√© Mokta El Hadid (15%) and the U.S. Steel (49%). A railway had first to be built to the coast, so full production was not expected until at least 1960. The Compagnie mini√®re de l'Ogoou√© (Comilog) had initial capital of CFA 150 million. The first ore was shipped from Moanda on 2 October 1962. Moanda is now one of the largest manganese mining centres in the world. The operating company, COMILOG, exports an average 3.5 million tons of manganese a year. This makes Gabon one of the three largest manganese exporters in the world. The manganese so far is exploited on the Bangombe Plateau (42 km¬≤).

His work was a reaction against French-influenced modernismo which, as an expression of a purely Mexican subject matter and emotional experience, is unique. He achieved great fame in his native land, to the point of being considered Mexico's national poet .  Biography  = Formative years = L√≥pez Velarde was born in el Marecito, Tepetongo near Jerez de Garc√≠a Salinas, Zacatecas. He was the first of nine children of Jos√© Guadalupe L√≥pez Velarde, a lawyer from Jalisco, and Trinidad Berumen Llamas, who came from a local landowning family. Jos√©, after an unsuccessful law career, had founded a Catholic school in Jerez. In 1900, Ram√≥n was sent to a seminary in Zacatecas, where he remained for two years; later, when his family moved, he transferred to a seminary in Aguascalientes. In 1905 he abandoned the seminary in favor of a career in the law. During his years in the seminary, Velarde had spent his holidays in Jerez. During one of these trips, he met Josefa de los R√≠os, a distant relative eight years his senior, who made a deep impression on him. The earliest poem ascribed to Velarde, \\"Fuensanta\\" (1905) is believed to have been inspired by her. In 1906 he collaborated on the literary review Bohemio, published in Aguascalientes by some of his friends, under the pseudonym of \\"Ricardo Wencer Olivares\\". The Bohemio group sided with Manuel Caballero, a Catholic Integralist opposed to literary modernism, during the controversy surrounding the 1907 reappearance of the polemical Revista Azul. However, their intervention had no appreciable effect on Mexican literary culture. In January 1908 Velarde began his law studies at the University of San Luis Potos√≠. Soon after, his father died, leaving the family, which had returned to Jerez, in a desperate financial situation. Thanks to the support of his maternal uncles, Velarde was able to continue his studies. He continued to collaborate on various publications in Aguascalientes (El Observador, El Debate, Nosotros) and later in Guadalajara (El Regional, Pluma y L√°piz). Bohemia had ceased to exist by 1907. In San Luis Potos√≠ Velarde read modernist poetry, especially that of Amado Nervo, to whom he will refer as \\"our greatest poet\\",PAZ, OCTAVIO, \\"El camino de la pasi√≥n: L√≥pez Velarde\\", M√©xico, Seix Barral, 2001. and Andr√©s Gonz√°lez Blanco. This radically changed his aesthetic sensibilities, transforming him into a fervent defender of modernism. In 1910 he began to write what would later become La sangre devota. = The Revolution = During the years of the Mexican Revolution, L√≥pez Velarde openly supported the political reforms of Francisco Madero, whom he met personally in 1910. In 1911 he received his law degree and became a judge in the small town of Venado. However, he left his position at the end of the year and traveled to Mexico City, hoping that Madero, the new president of the republic, might offer him a position in his government. Madero made no such offer, perhaps because of Velarde's militant Catholicism. Eduardo J. Correa, his old mentor, hired him in 1912 to collaborate on La Naci√≥n, a monthly Catholic journal in Mexico City. Velarde wrote poems, reviews, and political commentary about Mexico's new state of affairs. He attacked, among others, Emiliano Zapata. He left the journal soon after the revolt of February 9, 1913, which brought Victoriano Huerta to power. Trying to escape the political turmoil of Mexico City, he returned to San Luis Potos√≠. He began his courtship of Mar√≠a de Nevares, which he would continue for the rest of his life, unsuccessfully. At the beginning of 1914 he settled permanently in Mexico City. In the middle of 1915 the rise to power of Venustiano Carranza began a period of relative tranquility. Mexican poetry was currently dominated by the postmodernism of Enrique Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez, for whom Velarde had little admiration. He preferred the work of Jos√© Juan Tablada, who was also his good friend. During this period he was also interested in the work of the Argentine modernist Leopoldo Lugones, who left a decisive influence on Velarde's later work. = Nostalgia = In 1915 L√≥pez Velarde began to write more personal poems, marked by their nostalgia for his native Jerez (to which he would never return), and for his first love, \\"Fuensanta\\". In 1916 he published his first book, La sangre devota (The Pious Blood), which he dedicated to \\"the spirits\\" of the Mexican poets Manuel Guti√©rrez N√°jera and Manuel Jos√© Oth√≥n, and was well received by the Mexican literary community. The book ‚Äì and even its title ‚Äì concerned the Catholic liturgy, which was associated with the idealized world of the author's childhood in Jerez, and identified as the only refuge from his turbulent city life. The poem \\"Viaje al terru√±o\\" is fundamentally an attempt to evoke a return to childhood. Nevertheless, this nostalgia is not free of a certain ironic distance, as in the poem \\"Ten√≠as un rebozo de seda...\\" he remembers himself as a \\"seminarian, without Baudelaire, without rhyme, and without a sense of smell\\". In 1917, Josefa de los R√≠os, the inspiration for \\"Fuensanta\\", died. Velarde began to work on his next book, Zozobra (Sinking), which would not be published for another two years. Between March and July of that year he collaborated with Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez on the review Pegaso. Despite receiving increasing criticism for his Catholicism and provincialism, Velarde's literary prestige also began to rise. = Zozobra = In 1919 Velarde published Zozobra, considered by the majority of critics to be his major work. It was heavily ironic and drew both from his provincial upbringing and his recent experiences in the city. The influence of Lugones was evident in the book's tendency to avoid common settings, the employment of vocabulary then considered unpoetical, of unusual adjectives and unexpected metaphors, the use of word games, the frequency of proparoxytones, and the humorous use of rhyme. In this sense, the work also resembled that of the Uruguayan poet Julio Herrera y Reissig. Zozobra consists of forty poems arranged cyclically, begun by the line \\"Hoy como nunca\\" (\\"Today as never\\"), saying goodbye to Fuensanta and Jerez, and ending with the poem \\"Humildemente\\" (\\"Humbly\\"), which marks a symbolic return to his origins. Zozobra was strongly criticized by Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez. In 1920 the revolt of Alvaro Obreg√≥n brought an end to the government of Carranza, which for Velarde had been a period of stability and great productivity. But after a brief period of unrest in Velarde's life, Jos√© Vasconcelos was named minister of education, and promised a cultural renovation of the country. Velarde wrote for two journals promoted by Vasconcelos, M√©xico Moderno and El Maestro. In the latter, Velarde published one of his best-known essays, \\"Novedad de la Patria\\", where he expounded on the ideas of his earlier poems. Also appearing in El Maestro was \\"La suave patria\\", which would cement Velarde's reputation as Mexico's national poet. Velarde died on June 19, 1921, soon after turning thirty-three. His death was officially attributed to pneumonia, although it was speculated that syphilis might have been to blame. He left behind an unfinished book, El son del coraz√≥n (\\"The sound of the heart\\"), which would not be published until 1932.  His influence  After his death, at Vasconcelos' quiet urging, L√≥pez Velarde was given great honors, and held up as the national poet. His work, especially \\"La suave patria\\", was presented as the ultimate expression of post-revolutionary Mexican culture. This official appropriation did not preclude others from championing his work. The poets known as the Contempor√°neos saw Velarde, together with Tablada, as the beginning of modern Mexican poetry. Xavier Villaurrutia, in particular, insisted on the centrality of Velarde in the history of Mexican poetry, and compared him to Charles Baudelaire. The first complete study of Velarde was made by American author Allen W. Phillips in 1961. This formed the basis for a subsequent study by Octavio Paz, included in his book Cuadrivio (1963), in which he argued the modernity of L√≥pez Velarde, comparing him to Jules Laforgue, Leopoldo Lugones and Julio Herrera. Other critics, such as Gabriel Zaid, centered their analysis on Velarde's formative years and his strong Catholicism. On 1989, on Velarde's one hundredth birthday, Mexican author Guillermo Sheridan published a new biography of the poet, titled Un coraz√≥n adicto: la vida de Ram√≥n L√≥pez Velarde, which remains the most complete biography of Velarde to date. Velarde's oeuvre marks a moment of transition between modernism and the avant- garde. His work was marked by a novel approach to poetic language. At the same time, it was framed by duality, whether it be the Mexican struggle between rural traditions and the new culture of the cities, or his own struggle between asceticism and pagan sensuality. Despite his importance, he remains virtually unknown outside his own country.

During the Great Patriotic War he survived the Siege of Leningrad. His father, mother and other relatives died in it. In 1942 the then-eleven-year-old was transported from besieged Leningrad along the Road of Life. He stayed in the village of Greblo in the Novgorod region. In 1944 he returned to Leningrad and studied in the Leningrad Secondary Art School. From 1951 to 1957 he studied art at the I. Repin Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture under the direction of Professor Boris Ioganson. In 1956, he married Nina Vinogradova-Benois. He painted the image of Nina in many of his works. Nina Aleksandrovna was a descendant of the Benois family, a familiar name in art history. Her uncle was the artistic director of the La Scala Opera for 30 years. On 24 May 1986, Nina Vinogradova-Benois committed suicide, just a few days before the opening of the exhibition of her husband in Manege. Their children, Ivan and Vera, have both become artists. Glazunov's success at the International Competition of Young Artists in Prague prompted the opening of his first single exhibition in Moscow in 1957. Soon after in the 1960s, he traveled to Italy for the first time to paint the portraits of many famous actors and actress, including Gina Lollobrigida and Anita Ekberg. He also painted portraits of many political leaders, including Indira Gandhi, Leonid Brezhnev, Urho Kekkonen, Yury Luzhkov and Andrei Gromyko. In 1978, Glazunov started teaching in the Moscow University of Art. In 1987 he founded the Russian Academy of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture.

Biography =Early life= The son of a successful uniform manufacturer, Gibson was born in Salford but brought up in central Manchester with his younger brother, John, and their sister, Florence, who died at a very early age. Tragedy befell the family again when Gibson was 14, as both his parents contracted fatal illnesses and the children went to live with their paternal grandparents. The grandparents died soon after, and the children were taken in by their uncle, their mother's only brother, William Fell. Fell was himself a successful businessman, like the boys' father, and had become a famous corn merchant on the outskirts of the city. Gibson began working with Fell in the corn business, immersing himself in all aspects of the company, but excelling in sales. =Into the clothing industry= Just after the start of the 20th century, after 15 years working for his uncle, Gibson decided to set up his own company. The textiles industry in and around Manchester was booming at the time, so Gibson followed his father into the uniform business, and since his father's name was still fairly well known in the city, he quickly built up a portfolio of contacts. The business grew steadily for several years, before the outbreak of the First World War earned Gibson his first major contract; the company began manufacturing uniforms for the British Armed Forces on a daily basis. This deal forged Gibson's reputation and by the end of the war he had become a well-respected entrepreneur. However, the end of the war also meant that the company was now selling less uniforms and needed a new source of revenue. Not content with anything small-scale, Gibson approached the city corporations with an offer to provide uniforms for the tram drivers and conductors, selling the idea that they would be proud to wear such a uniform. The idea proved a success, and Gibson was able to diversify into other fields outside clothing. Nevertheless, he continued to concentrate on the uniform business and, in 1924, he entered into a partnership with Messrs F. Jones and R. H. H. Briggs, forming Briggs, Jones and Gibson. They relocated the business to larger premises on Lostock Street, near Oldham Road in Collyhurst, and the combined talents of the three men meant further expansion, both in Manchester and in other cities. However, in 1926, Jones died, putting the business under pressure. For reasons thought to be related to his age, Briggs also decided to sell his share in the business, and Gibson took sole control of the company. This coincided with the onset of the Great Depression, which meant a massive downturn in trade. Gibson's interests in other fields meant that the business was able to survive the Depression. =Manchester United= A Salfordian by birth, Gibson was living in Old Trafford in 1911 and was aware of his 'local' football team, who had just moved into their new stadium in the district, although whether he was an active supporter at this time is not known. Unlike the wealthy Gibson, Manchester United F.C. was being affected greatly by the Great Depression around the start of the 1930s. Their previous owner, John Henry Davies had died in 1927 after 25 years at the club. They had won the FA Cup and two league titles during the first 10 years of his chairmanship and by the time of Davies' death they were developing a reputation as a \\"yo-yo\\" club who regularly moved between the First and Second Divisions and their future was under threat by large debts. Gibson injected around ¬£40,000 more funds into the team during the Great Depression, though they continued to wander between the First and Second Divisions without looking like serious contenders for either the league title or the FA Cup. When Old Trafford was wrecked by German air raids on 11 March 1941, he also funded the rebuilding of the stadium, which was completed in 1949, and started the United Youth Academy that produced the great Busby Babes side of the mid-to-late 1950s. At the end of the Second World War, he appointed Matt Busby as manager, but only lived to see Busby bring one major trophy back to Old Trafford ‚Äì the 1948 FA Cup ‚Äì as he died in 1951, a year before they won their first top division title since 1911. He did not live to see the revolution of the Busby Babes later in the decade. References 1877 births 1951 deaths People from Salford Manchester United F.C. directors and chairmen ","title":"James W.

John Wesley believed that imparted righteousness worked in tandem with imputed righteousness. Imputed righteousness is the righteousness of Jesus credited to the Christian, enabling the Christian to be justified; imparted righteousness is what God does in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit after justification, working in the Christian to enable and empower the process of sanctification (and, in Wesleyan thought, Christian perfection). Scriptural support * Jeremiah 31:33-34 \\"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‚ÄòKnow the Lord,‚Äô for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.‚Äù\\" (ESV) * 2 Corinthians 3:18 \\"And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.\\" (ESV) John Wesley * Sermon #4: \\"Scriptural Christianity\\" * Sermon #14: \\"The Repentance of Believers\\" * Sermon #17: \\"The Circumcision of the Heart\\" * Sermon #20: \\"The Lord Our Righteousness\\" * Sermon #45: \\"The New Birth\\" Hymnody & other sources Charles Wesley believed in imparted righteousness. This comes through in the Wesleyan hymnody such as his famous hymn \\"And can it be\\". The last verse reads: No condemnation now I dread; Jesus, and all in Him, is mine ! Alive in Him, my living Head, And clothed in righteousness divine, Bold I approach the eternal throne, And claim the crown, through Christ my own. Clothed in righteousness divine. Ephesians 6:14 [TNIV] says \\"Stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place....\\" Protestant distinctive in imparted righteousness Preachers and theologians from various Protestant traditions (not only Wesleyan) use the term \\"imparted righteousness\\" to identify the righteous principle imparted by God to believers when He regenerates them. Believers thereby become \\"partakers of the divine nature\\" (cf. 2 Peter 1:4). It is this principle of righteousness imparted to men in regeneration which is ever in conflict with the old Adamic nature. Protestants, however, maintain the distinction between the \\"imputed righteousness\\" of Christ which is the basis for justification and the \\"imparted righteousness\\" which is the basis for subsequent sanctification. It is somewhat problematic for some Christians (notably Calvinists) to call the doctrine \\"imparted righteousness,\\" for that which is imparted is a righteous principle into man's nature, not righteousness per se. Care must be taken in using the term imparted righteousness because it is sometimes confused with and sometimes intentionally used to refer to the Roman Catholic doctrine of infused righteousness, which in Catholicism is the basis for justification.  The case against both Imputed and Imparted Righteousness  This section is a precis of N. T. Wright's work in \\"What Saint Paul Really Said\\".N. T. Wright, What Saint Paul really said Eerdmans, 1997. N. T. Wright, who is one of the best-known advocates of the New Perspective on Paul, explains that although the \\"righteousness of God\\" and \\"righteousness from God\\" have been confused and conflated in the past, they are distinct concepts. He relates the court-room metaphor, pointing out that there are three parties in the Hebrew court - two parties in disagreement and one judge (there is no \\"Prosecuting Attorney\\"). The judge decides the outcome of the dispute between the parties, declaring one to be correct and the other incorrect. The one who is declared \\"correct\\" in court is called \\"righteous\\" in the matter that was judged. The \\"righteousness of God\\", referring to God's (the judge's) faithfulness to the covenant relationship, can be neither imputed nor imparted to anybody but refers only to His role as judge. \\"Righteousness from God\\" is roughly equivalent to \\"vindication\\", meaning that God is pronouncing that particular party to be correct/vindicated/righteous/acquitted in their dispute with the other party. The dispute in question in Christian theology is between those of faith (in God's promises: the covenant, the Messiah), and \\"the wicked\\", meaning everybody opposed to those of faith. Paul was positing that the people of such faith are vindicated when Messiah returns, being declared \\"righteous\\" (or in other words, vindicated for their stance), which is exactly the meaning of the Biblical term \\"justified\\" in N. T. Wright's view. This means that we do not \\"receive\\" the righteousness of God (or as often expressed, \\"of Jesus\\") as in the classical Evangelical vernacular, nor is it \\"infused\\" as stated in the classical Roman Catholic vernacular. The \\"righteousness of God\\" remains His alone, and our \\"righteousness from God\\" means that we are found to be \\"of\\" the people of God. Paul's argument is that it has always been so, but what has changed is that the Messiah, in Jesus of Nazareth, has now appeared. An important verse to note is 2 Cor 5:21, \\"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\\" (ESV), which has traditionally been interpreted to mean that the Christian has, in some way, become righteous (by impartation or imputation), in exchange for Jesus' sinlessness. In fact, N. T. Wright says, Paul is speaking here of the apostles, and pointing out that in their role as apostles, their activity is effectively God's righteousness (covenant faithfulness) in action (\\"we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God\\" - vv 20-21). This meaning is natural when taken in context from verse 11 through 21.

Two years later he joined Cork Athletic as player-manager before eventually retiring after a season with Highland League Elgin City in 1957. Delaney has the distinction of having won the Scottish Cup with Celtic in 1937, the English FA Cup with Manchester United in 1948, and the Irish Cup with Derry City in 1954. He also came close to a fourth different national trophy in the Republic of Ireland, earning a FAI Cup runners-up medal with Cork Athletic in 1956. =International= Delaney won 15 caps for Scotland and scored 6 goals. He also represented the Scottish League XI six times.

C. S. Schiller, was a German-British philosopher. Born in Altona, Holstein (at that time member of the German Confederation, but under Danish administration), Schiller studied at the University of Oxford, later was a professor there, after being invited back after a brief time at Cornell University. Later in his life he taught at the University of Southern California. In his lifetime he was well known as a philosopher; after his death his work was largely forgotten. Schiller's philosophy was very similar to and often aligned with the pragmatism of William James, although Schiller referred to it as \\"humanism\\". He argued vigorously against both logical positivism and associated philosophers (for example, Bertrand Russell) as well as absolute idealism (such as F. H. Bradley). Schiller was an early supporter of evolution and a founding member of the English Eugenics Society.  Life  Born in 1864, one of three brothers and the son of Ferdinand Schiller (a Calcutta merchant), Schiller's family home was in Switzerland. Schiller grew up in Rugby. He was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, and graduated in the first class of Literae Humaniores, winning later the Taylorian scholarship for German in 1887. Schiller's first book, Riddles of the Sphinx (1891), was an immediate success despite his use of a pseudonym because of his fears concerning how the book would be received. Between the years 1893 and 1897 he was an instructor in philosophy at Cornell University. In 1897 he returned to Oxford and became fellow and tutor of Corpus Christi for more than thirty years. Schiller was president of the Aristotelian Society in 1921, and was for many years treasurer of the Mind Association. In 1926 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 1929 he was appointed visiting professor in the University of Southern California, and spent half of each year in the United States and half in England. Schiller died in Los Angeles either 6, 7 or 9 August 1937 after a long and lingering illness.\\"Obituary: Prof. F.C.S. Schiller\\" Nature 140, 454‚Äì455 (11 September 1937), link.\\"Notes: Dr. F.C.S. Schiller (1864‚Äì1937)\\" Mind, Vol. 47, No. 185, Jan 1938. Schiller was a founding member of the English Eugenics Society and published three books on the subject; Tantalus or the Future of Man (1924), Eugenics and Politics (1926), and Social Decay and Eugenic Reform (1932).\\"F.C.S. Schiller\\" in American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia, 2008, edited by John Lachs and Robert Talisse.  Philosophy  In 1891, F.C.S. Schiller made his first contribution to philosophy anonymously. Schiller feared that in his time of high naturalism, the metaphysical speculations of his Riddles of the Sphinx were likely to hurt his professional prospects (p. xi, Riddles). However, Schiller's fear of reprisal from his anti-metaphysical colleagues should not suggest that Schiller was a friend of metaphysics. Like his fellow pragmatists across the ocean, Schiller was attempting to stake out an intermediate position between both the spartan landscape of naturalism and the speculative excesses of the metaphysics of his time. In Riddles Schiller both, ::(1) accuses naturalism (which he also sometimes calls \\"pseudometaphysics\\" or \\"positivism\\") of ignoring the fact that metaphysics is required to justify our natural description of the world, and ::(2) accuses \\"abstract metaphysics\\" of losing sight of the world we actually live in and constructing grand, disconnected imaginary worlds. The result, Schiller contends, is that naturalism cannot make sense of the \\"higher\\" aspects of our world (freewill, consciousness, God, purpose, universals), while abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the \\"lower\\" aspects of our world (the imperfect, change, physicality). In each case we are unable to guide our moral and epistemological \\"lower\\" lives to the achievement of life's \\"higher\\" ends, ultimately leading to scepticism on both fronts. For knowledge and morality to be possible, both the world's lower and higher elements must be real; e.g. we need universals (a higher) to make knowledge of particulars (a lower) possible. This would lead Schiller to argue for what he at the time called a \\"concrete metaphysics\\", but would later call \\"humanism\\". Shortly after publishing Riddles of the Sphinx, Schiller became acquainted with the work of pragmatist philosopher William James and this changed the course of his career. For a time, Schiller's work became focused on extending and developing James' pragmatism (under Schiller's preferred title, \\"humanism\\"). Schiller even revised his earlier work Riddles of the Sphinx to make the nascent pragmatism implicit in that work more explicit. In one of Schiller's most prominent works during this phase of his career, \\"Axioms as Postulates\\" (1903), Schiller extended James' will to believe doctrine to show how it could be used to justify not only an acceptance of God, but also our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more. Towards the end of his career, Schiller's pragmatism began to take on a character more distinct from the pragmatism of William James. Schiller's focus became his opposition to formal logic. To understand Schiller's opposition to formal logic, consider the following inference: ::(1) All salt is soluble in water; ::(2) Cerebos is not soluble in water; ::(3) Therefore, Cerebos is not a salt. From the formal characteristics of this inference alone (All As are Bs; c is not a B; Therefore, c is not an A), formal logic would judge this to be a valid inference. Schiller, however, refused to evaluate the validity of this inference merely on its formal characteristics. Schiller argued that unless we look to the contextual fact regarding what specific problem first prompted this inference to actually occur, we can not determine whether the inference was successful (i.e. pragmatically successful). In the case of this inference, since \\"Cerebos is 'salt' for culinary, but not for chemical purposes\\",Schiller, F.C.S. (1930) page 276 without knowing whether the purpose for this piece of reasoning was culinary or chemical we cannot determine whether this is valid or not. In another example, Schiller discusses the truth of formal mathematics \\"1+1=2\\" and points out that this equation does not hold if one is discussing drops of water. Schiller's attack on formal logic and formal mathematics never gained much attention from philosophers, however it does share some weak similarities to the contextualist view in contemporary epistemology as well as the views of ordinary language philosophers. = Opposition to naturalism and metaphysics = In Riddles, Schiller gives historical examples of the dangers of abstract metaphysics in the philosophies of Plato, Zeno, and Hegel, portraying Hegel as the worst offender: \\"Hegelianism never anywhere gets within sight of a fact, or within touch of reality. And the reason is simple: you cannot, without paying the penalty, substitute abstractions for realities; the thought-symbol cannot do duty for the thing symbolized\\".Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) Riddles of the Sphinx, p. 160 Schiller argued that the flaw in Hegel's system, as with all systems of abstract metaphysics, is that the world it constructs always proves to be unhelpful in guiding our imperfect, changing, particular, and physical lives to the achievement of the \\"higher\\" universal Ideals and Ends. For example, Schiller argues that the reality of time and change is intrinsically opposed to the very modus operandi of all systems of abstract metaphysics. He says that the possibility to change is a precondition of any moral action (or action generally), and so any system of abstract metaphysics is bound to lead us into a moral scepticism. The problem lies in the aim of abstract metaphysics for \\"interpreting the world in terms of conceptions, which should be true not here and now, but \\"eternally\\" and independently of Time and Change.\\" The result is that metaphysics must use conceptions that have the \\"time-aspect of Reality\\" abstracted away. Of course, \\"[o]nce abstracted from,\\" While abstract metaphysics provides us with a world of beauty and purpose and various other \\"highers\\", it condemns other key aspects of the world we live in as imaginary. The world of abstract metaphysics has no place for imperfect moral agents who (1) strive to learn about the world and then (2) act upon the world to change it for the better. Consequently, abstract metaphysics condemns us as illusionary, and declares our place in the world as unimportant and purposeless. Where abstractions take priority, our concrete lives collapse into scepticism and pessimism. He also makes a case against the alternative naturalist method, saying that this too results in an epistemological and moral scepticism. Schiller looks to show this method's inadequacy at moving from the cold, lifeless lower world of atoms to the higher world of ethics, meanings, and minds. As with abstract metaphysics, Schiller attacks naturalism on many fronts: (1) the naturalist method is unable to reduce universals to particulars, (2) the naturalist method is unable to reduce freewill to determinist movements, (3) the naturalist method is unable to reduce emergent properties like consciousness to brain activity, (4) the naturalist method is unable to reduce God into a pantheism, and so on. Just as the abstract method cannot find a place for the lower elements of our world inside the higher, the naturalist method cannot find a place for the higher elements of our world inside the lower. In a reversal of abstract metaphysics, naturalism denies the reality of the higher elements to save the lower. Schiller uses the term \\"pseudo-metaphysical\\" here instead of naturalism‚Äîas he sometimes does‚Äîbecause he is accusing these naturalist philosophers of trying to solve metaphysical problems while sticking to the non-metaphysical \\"lower\\" aspects of the world (i.e. without engaging in real metaphysics): To show that the world's higher elements do not reduce to the lower is not yet to show that naturalism must condemn the world's higher elements as illusionary. A second component to Schiller's attack is showing that naturalism cannot escape its inability to reduce the higher to the lower by asserting that these higher elements evolve from the lower. However, Schiller does not see naturalism as any more capable of explaining the evolution of the higher from the lower than it is capable of reducing the higher to the lower. While evolution does begin with something lower that in turn evolves into something higher, the problem for naturalism is that whatever the starting point for evolution is, it must first be something with the potential to evolve into a higher. For example, the world cannot come into existence from nothing because the potential or \\"germ\\" of the world is not \\"in\\" nothing (nothing has no potential, it has nothing; after all, it is nothing). Likewise, biological evolution cannot begin from inanimate matter, because the potential for life is not \\"in\\" inanimate matter. The following passage shows Schiller applying the same sort of reasoning to the evolution of consciousness: > Taken as the type of the pseudo-metaphysical method, which explains the > higher by the lower ... it does not explain the genesis of consciousness out > of unconscious matter, because we cannot, or do not, attribute potential > consciousness to matter. ... the theory of Evolution derives the [end > result] from its germ, i.e., from that which was, what it became, > potentially. Unable to either reduce or explain the evolution of the higher elements of our world, naturalism is left to explain away the higher elements as mere illusions. In doing this, naturalism condemns us to a scepticism in the both epistemology and ethics. It is worth noting, that while Schiller's work has been largely neglected since his death, Schiller's arguments against a naturalistic account of evolution have been recently cited by advocates of intelligent design to establish the existence of a longer history for the view due to legal concerns in the United States (See: Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District). = Humanist alternative to metaphysics and naturalism = Schiller argued that both abstract metaphysics and naturalism portray man as holding an intolerable position in the world. He proposed a method that not only recognises the lower world we interact with, but takes into account the higher world of purposes, ideals and abstractions. Schiller: > We require, then, a method which combines the excellencies of both the > pseudo-metaphysical and the abstract metaphysical, if philosophy is to be > possible at all.Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 164 Schiller was demanding a course correction in field of metaphysics, putting it at the service of science. For example, to explain the creation of the world out of nothing, or to explain the emergence or evolution of the \\"higher\\" parts of the world, Schiller introduces a divine being who might generate the end (i.e. Final Cause) which gives nothingness, lifelessness, and unconscious matter the purpose (and thus potential) of evolving into higher forms: > And thus, so far from dispensing with the need for a Divine First Cause, the > theory of evolution, if only we have the faith in science to carry it to its > conclusion, and the courage to interpret it, proves irrefragably that no > evolution was possible without a pre-existent Deity, and a Deity, moreover, > transcendent, non-material and non-phenomenal. ... [T]he world process is > the working out of an anterior purpose or idea in the divine > consciousness.Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 198 This re-introduction of teleology (which Schiller sometimes calls a re- anthropomorphizing of the world) is what Schiller says the naturalist has become afraid to do. Schiller's method of concrete metaphysics (i.e. his humanism) allows for an appeal to metaphysics when science demands it. However: Schiller finally reveals what this \\"End\\" is which \\"all things tend\\": > If our speculations have not entirely missed their mark, the world-process > will come to an end when all the spirits whom it is designed to harmonise > [by its Divine Creator] have been united in a perfect society.Schiller, > F.C.S. (1891) p. 436 Now, while by today's philosophic standards Schiller's speculations would be considered wildly metaphysical and disconnected from the sciences, compared with the metaphysicians of his day (Hegel, McTaggart, etc.), Schiller saw himself as radically scientific. Schiller gave his philosophy a number of labels during his career. Early on he used the names \\"Concrete Metaphysics\\" and \\"Anthropomorphism\\", while later in life tending towards \\"Pragmatism\\" and particularly \\"Humanism\\". = The Will to Believe = Schiller also developed a method of philosophy intended to mix elements of both naturalism and abstract metaphysics in a way that allows us to avoid the twin scepticisms each method collapses into when followed on its own. However, Schiller does not assume that this is enough to justify his humanism over the other two methods. He accepts the possibility that both scepticism and pessimism are true. To justify his attempt to occupy the middle ground between naturalism and abstract metaphysics, Schiller makes a move that anticipates James' The Will to Believe: > And in action especially we are often forced to act upon slight > possibilities. Hence, if it can be shown that our solution is a possible > answer, and the only possible alternative to pessimism, to a complete > despair of life, it would deserve acceptance, even though it were but a bare > possibility.Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 5 Schiller contends that in light of the other methods' failure to provide humans with a role and place in the universe, we ought avoid the adoption of these methods. By the end of Riddles, Schiller offers his method of humanism as the only possible method that results in a world where we can navigate our lower existence to the achievement of our higher purpose. He asserts that it is the method we ought to adopt regardless of the evidence against it (\\"even though it were but a bare possibility\\"). While Schiller's will to believe is a central theme of Riddle of the Sphinx (appearing mainly in the introduction and conclusion of his text), in 1891 the doctrine held a limited role in Schiller's philosophy. In Riddles, Schiller only employs his version of the will to believe doctrine when he is faced with overcoming sceptic and pessimistic methods of philosophy. In 1897, William James published his essay \\"The Will to Believe\\" and this influenced Schiller to drastically expanded his application of the doctrine. For a 1903 volume titled Personal Idealism, Schiller contributed a widely read essay titled \\"Axioms as Postulates\\" in which he sets out to justify the \\"axioms of logic\\" as postulates adopted on the basis of the will to believe doctrine. In this essay Schiller extends the will to believe doctrine to be the basis of our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more. He notes that we postulate that nature is uniform because we need nature to be uniform: > [O]ut of the hurly-burly of events in time and space [we] extract[ ] > changeless formulas whose chaste abstraction soars above all reference to > any 'where' or 'when,' and thereby renders them blank cheques to be filled > up at our pleasure with any figures of the sort. The only question is‚ÄîWill > Nature honour the cheque? Audentes Natura juvat‚Äîlet us take our life in our > hands and try! If we fail, our blood will be on our own hands (or, more > probably, in some one else's stomach), but though we fail, we are in no > worse case than those who dared not postulate ... Our assumption, therefore, > is at least a methodological necessity; it may turn out to be (or be near) a > fundamental fact in nature [an axiom].Schiller, F.C.S. (1903) \\"Axioms as > Postulates\\", p. 111 Schiller stresses that doctrines like the uniformity of nature must first be postulated on the basis of need (not evidence) and only then \\"justified by the evidence of their practical working.\\" He attacks both empiricists like John Stuart Mill, who try to conclude that nature is uniform from previous experience, as well as Kantians who conclude that nature is uniform from the preconditions on our understanding. Schiller argues that preconditions are not conclusions, but demands made on our experience that may or may not work. On this success hinges our continued acceptance of the postulate and its eventual promotion to axiom status. In \\"Axioms and Postulates\\" Schiller vindicates the postulation by its success in practice, marking an important shift from Riddles of a Sphinx. In Riddles, Schiller is concerned with the vague aim of connecting the \\"higher\\" to the \\"lower\\" so he can avoid scepticism, but by 1903 he has clarified the connection he sees between these two elements. The \\"higher\\" abstract elements are connected to the lower because they are our inventions for dealing with the lower; their truth depends on their success as tools. Schiller dates the entry of this element into his thinking in his 1892 essay \\"Reality and 'Idealism'\\" (a mere year after his 1891 Riddles). The shift in Schiller's thinking continues in his next published work, The Metaphysics of the Time-Process (1895): The abstractions of metaphysics, then, exist as explanations of the concrete facts of life, and not the latter as illustrations of the former ... Science [along with humanism] does not refuse to interpret the symbols with which it operates; on the contrary, it is only their applicability to the concrete facts originally abstracted from that is held to justify their use and to establish their 'truth.'Schiller, F.C.S. (1895) \\"The Metaphysics of the Time-Process\\"; also reprinted on pages 102‚Äì103 of Humanism (1903) Schiller's accusations against the metaphysician in Riddles now appear in a more pragmatic light. His objection is similar to one we might make against a worker who constructs a flat-head screwdriver to help him build a home, and who then accuses a screw of unreality when he comes upon a Phillips-screw that his flat-head screwdriver won't fit. In his works after Riddles, Schiller's attack takes the form of reminding the abstract metaphysician that abstractions are meant as tools for dealing with the \\"lower\\" world of particulars and physicality, and that after constructing abstractions we cannot simply drop the un-abstracted world out of our account. The un-abstracted world is the entire reason for making abstractions in the first place. We did not abstract to reach the unchanging and eternal truths; we abstract to construct an imperfect and rough tool for dealing with life in our particular and concrete world. It is the working of the higher in \\"making predictions about the future behavior of things for the purpose of shaping the future behavior of things for the purpose of shaping our own conduct accordingly\\" that justifies the higher.Schiller, F.C.S. (1903) Humanism p. 104 > To assert this methodological character of eternal truths is not, of course, > to deny their validity ... To say that we assume the truth of abstraction > because we wish to attain certain ends, is to subordinate theoretic 'truth' > to a teleological implication; to say that, the assumption once made, its > truth is 'proved' by its practical working ... For the question of the > 'practical' working of a truth will always ultimately be found to resolve > itself into the question whether we can live by it.Schiller, F.C.S. (1903) > Humanism p. 105 A few lines down from this passage Schiller adds the following footnote in a 1903 reprint of the essay: \\"All this seems a very fairly definite anticipation of modern pragmatism.\\" Indeed, it resembles the pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's pragmatism was still very different from both that of William James and that of Charles Sanders Peirce. = Opposition to logic = As early as 1891 Schiller had independently reached a doctrine very similar to William James' Will to Believe. As early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern with meaning was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down the timeless, perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore, examining their formal features instead of their function in an actual situation is to make the same mistake the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves. Both Schiller's theory of truth and meaning (i.e. Schiller's pragmatism) derive their justification from an examination of thought from what he calls his humanist viewpoint (his new name for concrete metaphysics). He informs us that to answer \\"what precisely is meant by having a meaning\\" will require us to \\"raise the prior question of why we think at all.\\".Schiller, F.C.S. (1930) p.51 A question Schiller of course looks to evolution to provide. Schiller provides a detailed defence of his pragmatist theories of truth and meaning in a chapter titled \\"The Biologic of Judgment\\" in Logic for Use (1929). The account Schiller lays out in many ways resembles some of what Peirce asserts in his \\"The Fixation of Belief\\" (1877) essay: This passage of Schiller was worth quoting at length because of the insight this chapter offers into Schiller's philosophy. In the passage, Schiller makes the claim that thought only occurs when our unthinking habits prove themselves inadequate for handling a particular situation. Schiller's stressing of the genesis of limited occurrences of thought sets Schiller up for his account of meaning and truth. Schiller asserts that when a person utters a statement in a situation they are doing so for a specific purpose: to solve the problem that habit could not handle alone. The meaning of such a statement is whatever contribution it makes to accomplishing the purpose of this particular occurrence of thought. The truth of the statement will be if it helps accomplishes that purpose. No utterance or thought can be given a meaning or a truth valuation outside the context of one of these particular occurrences of thought. This account of Schiller's is a much more extreme view than even James took. At first glance, Schiller appears very similar to James. However, Schiller's more stringent requirement that meaningful statements have consequences \\"to some one for some purpose\\" makes Schiller's position more extreme than James'. For Schiller, it is not a sufficient condition for meaningfulness that a statement entail experiential consequences (as it is for both Peirce and James). Schiller requires that the consequences of a statement make the statement relevant to some particular person's goals at a specific moment in time if it is to be meaningful. Therefore, it is not simply enough that the statement \\"diamonds are hard\\" and the statement \\"diamonds are soft\\" entail different experiential consequences, it is also required that the experiential difference makes a difference to someone's purposes. Only then, and only to that person, do the two statements state something different. If the experiential difference between hard and soft diamonds did not connect up with my purpose for entering into thought, the two statements would possess the same meaning. For example, if I were to randomly blurt out \\"diamonds are hard\\" and then \\"diamonds are soft\\" to everyone in a coffee shop one day, my words would mean nothing. Words can only mean something if they are stated with a specific purpose. Consequently, Schiller rejects the idea that statements can have meaning or truth when they are looked upon in the abstract, away from a particular context. \\"Diamonds are hard\\" only possesses meaning when stated (or believed) at some specific situation, by some specific person, uttered (or believed) for some specific aim. It is the consequences the statement holds for that person's purposes which constitute its meaning, and its usefulness in accomplishing that person's purposes that constitutes the statement's truth or falsity. After all, when we look at the sentence \\"diamonds are hard\\" in a particular situation we may find it actually has nothing to say about diamonds. A speaker may very well be using the sentence as a joke, as a codephrase, or even simply as an example of a sentence with 15 letters. Which the sentence really means cannot be determined without the specific purpose a person might be using the statement for in a specific context. In an article titled \\"Pragmatism and Pseudo-pragmatism\\" Schiller defends his pragmatism against a particular counterexample in a way that sheds considerable light on his pragmatism: > The impossibility of answering truly the question whether the 100th (or > 10,000th) decimal in the evaluation of Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly > illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from > actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until > the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather > will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some > purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the > calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no > 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has > really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, > not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is > possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a > desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is > practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, > because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference > whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, > say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is > a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question > become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. > Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual > context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until > the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context > Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the > 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist > theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th > decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set > himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most > useful, truth, and‚Äîtriumphantly refute his own contention!Schiller, F.C.S. > (1906) \\"Pragmatism and Pseudo-pragmatism\\", p. 384 We might recognise this claim as the sort of absurdity many philosophers try to read into the pragmatism of William James. James, however, would not agree that the meaning of \\"the 100th decimal of Pi is 9\\" and \\"the 100th decimal of Pi is 6\\" mean the same thing until someone has a reason to care about any possible difference. Schiller, in constast, does mean to say this. James and Schiller both treat truth as something that happens to a statement, and so James would agree that it only becomes true that the 100th decimal of Pi is 9 when someone in fact believes that statement and it leads them to their goals, but nowhere does James imply that meaning is something that happens to a statement. That is a unique element of Schiller's pragmatism. = Humanist theory of meaning and truth = While Schiller felt greatly indebted to the pragmatism of William James, Schiller was outright hostile to the pragmatism of C.S. Peirce. Both Schiller and James struggled with what Peirce intended with his pragmatism, and both were often baffled by Peirce's insistent rebuffing of what they both saw as the natural elaboration of the pragmatist cornerstone he himself first laid down. On the basis of his misunderstandings, Schiller complains that for Peirce to merely say \\"'truths should have practical consequences'\\" is to be \\"very vague, and hints at no reason for the curious connexion it asserts.\\" Schiller goes on to denigrate Peirce's principle as nothing more than a simple truism \\"which hardly deserves a permanent place and name in philosophic usage\\". After all, Schiller points out, \\"[i]t is hard ... to see why even the extremest intellectualism should deny that the difference between the truth and the falsehood of an assertion must show itself in some visible way.\\"Schiller, F.C.S. (1905) p. 236 With Peirce's attempts to restrict the use of pragmatism set aside, Schiller unpacks the term \\"consequences\\" to provide what he considers as a more substantial restatement of Peirce's pragmatism: > For to say that a [statement] has consequences and that what has none is > meaningless, must surely mean that it has a bearing upon some human > interest; they must be consequences to some one for some purpose. Schiller believes his pragmatism to be more developed because of its attention to the fact that the \\"consequences\\" which make up the meaning and truth of a statement, must always be consequences for someone's particular purposes at some particular time. Continuing his condemnation of the abstract, Schiller contends that the meaning of a concept is not the consequences of some abstract proposition, but what consequences an actual thinker hopes its use will bring about in an actual situation. The meaning of a thought is what consequences one means to bring about when they employ the thought. To Schiller, this is what a more sophisticated pragmatist understands by the term meaning. If we are to understand the pragmatic theory of meaning in Schiller's way, he is right to claim that James' theory of truth is a mere corollary of the pragmatist theory of meaning: > But now, we may ask, how are these 'consequences' to test the 'truth' > claimed by the assertion? Only by satisfying or thwarting that purpose, by > forwarding or baffling that interest. If they do the one, the assertion is > 'good' and pro tanto 'true' ; if they do the other, 'bad' and 'false'. Its > 'consequences,' therefore, when investigated, always turn out to involve the > 'practical' predicates 'good ' or 'bad,' and to contain a reference to ' > practice' in the sense in which we have used that term. So soon as therefore > we go beyond an abstract statement of the narrower pragmatism, and ask what > in the concrete, and in actual knowing, 'having consequences ' may mean, we > develop inevitably the fullblown pragmatism in the wider sense.Schiller, > F.C.S. (1905) pages 236‚Äì237 Given Schiller's view that the meaning of a thought amounts to the consequences one means to bring about by the thought, Schiller further concluded that the truth of a thought depends on whether it actually brings about the consequences one intended. For example, if while following a cooking recipe that called for salt I were to think to myself, \\"Cerebos is salt\\", my thought will be true if it consequently leads me to add Cerebos and produce a dish with the intended taste. However, if while working in a chemistry lab to produce a certain mixture I were to think to myself, \\"Cerebos is salt\\", my thought would both have a different meaning than before (since my intent now differs) and be false (since Cerebos is only equivalent to salt for culinary purposes). According to Schiller, the question of what a thought like \\"Cerebos is salt\\" means or whether it is true can only be answered if the specific circumstances with which the thought arose are taken into consideration. While there is some similarity here between Schiller's view of meaning and the later ordinary language philosophers, Schiller's account ties meaning and truth more closely to individuals and their intent with a specific use rather than whole linguistic communities.

Beginnings Erastus Bigelow was born in West Boylston, Massachusetts. He was the son of a cotton weaver, and it was his parents' desire that he should become a physician, but, his father's business not being successful, he was unable to continue his studies, and so turned his attention to inventing. He showed an inventive genius at the early age of 14, when he invented a machine to manufacture piping cord, for which he received $100. Before he had reached the age of 18, he had devised a handloom for suspender webbing. His work on Stenography, a short manual on shorthand writing, was written and published about this time. In 1838, he invented a power loom for weaving knotted counterpanes, and later a power loom to weave coach lace and took his brother, Horatio, in with him. Carpets In 1839 he contracted to produce a power-loom capable of weaving two-ply ingrain carpets, such as had been hitherto woven exclusively by the handloom, which only produced eight yards a day. With his first loom he succeeded in obtaining ten or twelve yards daily, which he increased by improvements until a product of twenty-five yards was regularly obtained. Afterward he invented a power loom for weaving \\"Brussels\\" (i.e. pictorial tapestry) and velvet tapestry carpets, his most important invention, which attracted much attention at the World's Fair in London in 1851. The town of Clinton, Massachusetts, owed its growth and manufacturing importance to him, as it contained the coach-lace works, the Lancaster Quilt Company, and the Bigelow Carpet Company, all of which were direct results of his inventive ability. The carpet loom made his name widely known.Biography of Erastus Bigelow Bigelow and his brother Horatio are credited with founding the town of Clinton, which was originally part of the town of Lancaster. Bigelow was elected a member of the Boston Historical Society in April 1864, and in 1869 presented to that society six large volumes entitled Inventions of Erastus Brigham Bigelow patented in England from 1837 to 1868 in which were gathered the printed specifications of eighteen patents granted to him in England. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1866. In 1862 Bigelow formulated a scheme of uniform taxation for the United States by means of stamps, and he published The Tariff Question, considered in regard to the Policy of England and the Interests of the United States (Boston, 1863). Legacy and descendants Bigelow founded the Bigelow Mechanics Institute in 1846, which is today known as the Bigelow Free Public Library located in Clinton, Massachusetts.Bigelow Free Public Library He was also an original incorporator of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded in 1861. Bigelow's only child, Helen Bigelow Merriman, became an artist and art collector and one of the founders of the Worcester Art Museum, and his grandson Roger Merriman became a noted historian.\\"Merriman Family Papers\\".

The Ur-Quan are introduced in Star Control as an intelligent race of giant predatory caterpillars, and the leader of a hierarchy of battle thralls. Their story is developed much further in the sequel, with a traumatic past leading them to fiercely seek their own security. The Ur-Quan's military doctrine becomes a subject of intense internal conflict, leading to a civil war. In Star Control 3, developed by a different team, they ally with the player against a different antagonist and their role is scaled back. The Ur-Quan's role in Star Control II has earned acclaim among the best game villains of all time. Besides their menacing and threatening persona, they are praised for their surprising depth and humanity.  Background  alt=The Ur-Quan are an alien race of giant predatory caterpillars. Their biological origins are similar to solitary predators such as the praying mantis, who are naturally limited in their social behaviors. As the Ur-Quan evolved, they were able to master their fierce territorial and hunting instincts, and build a co- operative spacefaring civilization. Prior to the events of the games, the Ur- Quan were discovered by an evil psychic race called the Dnyarri, who enslaved the Ur-Quan and compelled them to dominate the rest of known space. Using genetic engineering, the Dnyarri separated the original brown Ur-Quan into two sub-species. The green Ur-Quan became the Dnyarri's favored administrators and researchers, and the black Ur-Quan became their designated soldiers. Much later, the Ur-Quan led a successful slave revolt. They discovered they could break the Dnyarri's psychic compulsion by torturing themselves, giving them enough time to kill and eventually exterminate their Dnyarri oppressors. The Ur-Quan vowed they would never again be slaves, and began to conquer all other intelligent life in the galaxy. The green Ur-Quan were renamed the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za in honor of the Ur-Quan scientist who freed them all. The Kzer-Za moved forward with the 'Path of Now and Forever', a policy of security through enslaving all non-Ur-Quan sentient life, controlling them as either battle thralls, or forever imprisoning them on their home worlds under impenetrable force-fields. The Black Ur-Quan, renamed the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah after their new leader, felt that they could only be safe with the utter annihilation of all non-Ur-Quan life, an ideology they called the 'Eternal Doctrine'. The differing doctrines of the two fiercely territorial species escalated into a civil war. After devastating losses, the Kzer-Za eventually triumphed through the discovery of an enormous ancient battleship created by a lost alien civilization called the Precursors. By the time of the games, the Ur-Quan form a Hierarchy of enslaved races, and travel the galaxy enforcing their doctrine of security through slavery. Star Control II begins following the war from the first game, after the victorious Ur-Quan enslave humanity and their allies. At the climax of Star Control II, the Ur-Quan are defeated when a bomb destroys their ancient Precursor battleship. At the start of Star Control 3, the Ur- Quan join an alliance with the player, but are ultimately undermined by another civil war with the Kohr-Ah.  Concept and creation  GDC 2015 Creators Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford first conceived of the Ur-Quan for the original Star Control. Reiche and Ford began with paper illustrations, which led them to implement ships with special abilities, with each character concept inspired by each ship's unique look-and-feel. Reiche describes their character creation process, \\"I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them. I hold little conversations with them. 'What do you guys do?' And they tell me.\\" One of the large ships had the ability to launch fighters, which led the designers to a creative conclusion - these aliens seemed to have command over others, and they would be an ancient race that plays the role of the main antagonist. Reiche and Ford felt that the word \\"Ur-\\" had ancient connotations, and liked the sound of \\"Quan\\", and thus the Ur-Quan were created. The first Star Control's story was mainly written in the instruction manual, describing the Ur-Quan as founders of an evil Hierarchy, a \\"rigid union of the ancient Ur-Quan slavers and their minions\\". Reiche and Ford wrote the Ur-Quan's motivations for galactic dominance as their desire for slaves. Reiche had previously created a mantis-inspired race called the Thri-Kreen for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, and the mantis continued to inspire the creation of Star Control's insectoid species. When Reiche saw a National Geographic image of a predatory caterpillar dangling over its prey, this became the basis for the Ur-Quan's appearance. The origins of Star Control II were motivated by the designers' interest in expanding on the first game's story. As they began writing the new game, Reiche and Ford used the first game's characters to tell simple visual stories about their fictional conflicts. Their intention was to develop aliens who were exaggerations of human flaws, personalities, and cultures. The Ur-Quan were already understood as a race of slavers in Star Control, so the writers developed their motivation by imagining them as former slaves themselves. Reiche attempted to humanize the Ur-Quan, based on his own \\"relationships with people who had experienced significant childhood abuse and how those traumas produced distinctly odd behaviors in adults. [The Ur-Quan's] doctrines were the overtly crazy but internally reasonable responses to their treatment by the Dnyarri, and the pain they had to endure to win their freedom from slavery.\\" The team describes this writing process as imagining justifications for past creative decisions, building logically on details about the Ur-Quan's history, artwork, and game abilities. The Ur-Quan theme music for Star Control II was created by fantasy artist Erol Otus, who first composed the song on a synthesizer before it was re-sampled and exported to MOD file format. The 3DO version of Star Control II features the voice of Larry Zee for the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za, and David Bryce for the Ur-Quan Kohr Ah.  Reception  The Ur-Quan have been described by gaming publications among the best science fiction races ever created. Game Historian Rusel DeMaria claims that the Ur-Quan are \\"one of the all-time villainous races in the history of computer games\\". Praising the complexity of the Ur-Quan, Rock, Paper, Shotgun explains that \\"part of Star Control II is slowly learning that the Ur-Quan aren't actually as bad as they seem\\", and proclaims the Ur-Quan a \\"galactic threat better than basically any science fiction role-playing video game that came after\\". GameSpot ranked the Ur-Quan as the best computer game villain in 1999, explaining how their \\"masochistic and truly sad history makes the Ur- Quan one of the very best villains. Even now, we are hard-pressed to find a race of adversaries as complex and three-dimensional as the Ur-Quan.\\" This mirrored their reader-voted awards, where fans chose the Ur-Quan as the 4th greatest game villains ever. The Ur-Quan remain an iconic part of what made Star Control a success. AllGame describes Star Control II as a masterpiece, while declaring that \\"nothing compares to the horrible plight of the Ur-Quan, ostensibly the major villains in the game. By the time you learn about the millennia of enslavement and mind-control they've had to endure in the past, not to mention the self-inflicted excruciating torments they underwent to gain freedom, the Ur-Quan become more sympathetic than most of the friendly-but- fluttery allies populating your own fleet. This is a rare and praiseworthy design achievement.\\" BioWare co-founder Ray Muzyka credits Star Control as an influence on Mass Effect, leading journalists to note the similarities between the games' villains, \\"as Sovereign's words -- and voice -- echo those of the Ur-Quan almost line for line\\". GameSpot mentions the Ur-Quan for their role in one of the best video game endings, and GameSpot readers frequently praised the Ur-Quan for their role in one of the greatest game settings of all time. The Ur-Quan have also been celebrated for their music and sound design. Hardcore Gaming describes how the unique style of each song \\"works to the game‚Äôs benefit, because, again, they give each race their own personality\\", particularly the Ur-Quan's \\"low and foreboding\\" theme. This similarly led GameSpot to rank the Star Control II soundtrack as the second greatest of all time, as \\"these themes were as diverse as the aliens' appearances. Your Green Ur-Quan masters had a commanding, pounding beat, while their more sinister brothers, the Black Ur-Quan, had a more menacing and subtle theme.\\" Retro Gamer applauds the voice acting and dialog for the Ur-Quan, including the \\"absolute dread caused by hearing in-depth explanations of what it's like to wear a 'pain excruciator'\\". Star Control 3 was developed and written by a different team. Hardcore Gaming 101 lamented the Ur-Quan's new allied role in the third game, explaining that \\"as menacing as the Ur-Quan were in Star Control II, and how cool it is that they're on your side in this game, they barely do anything here.\\" Game magazine Pelit made a similar criticism, that the third game was left lacking a threat as memorable as the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah.

He was known for defining a style of Haitian compas music he called kompa mamba, and for the sometimes bawdy innuendo used in his songs. During his career, he was one of Haiti's most prominent musicians, and found much success in West Africa as well. Early years As a young man, he received a classical music education and worked as a cabinetmaker before becoming a professional football player. It was from football, playing defense for the Port-au-Prince club Aigles Noirs, that he acquired his nickname, \\"Coup√© Clou√©\\" or \\"cut and nailed\\". He began performing on guitar in 1951, and in 1957 he formed the band Trio Crystal, which he later renamed Trio Select, along with another guitar player and a maraca player. Their first album, one of the dozens Henry released during his career, was released in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s the group expanded from its original three, and renamed itself Ensemble Select. That decade also saw an increase in his use of racy spoken preaching and storytelling in addition to singing during songs; this became one of his trademarks. In 1978 Coup√© Clou√© toured extensively in Africa, greatly increasing his international prominence. His popularity in West Africa was especially boosted by similarities between the rhythms and sounds of Henry's music an African soukous music. It was there that Henry earned the nickname, Roi Coup√© (or \\"King Coup√©\\"). During the 1980s and early 1990s, Henry continued to perform and record prolifically. Henry died of diabetes in January 1998, having only retired from performing the previous month. He was mourned in Port-au-Prince by a day-long outdoor funeral celebration, attended by thousands of people, including the interim Minister of Culture.

The serial was first broadcast in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 24 February to 31 March 1973. It was the last serial to feature Roger Delgado in the role of the Master. The serial is set on the Earth, the Moon, Draconia, and the home planet of the Ogrons in the 26th century. In the serial, the Daleks employ the Master to provoke a war between the humans and the Draconians' galactic empires. Plot As the Earth cargo ship C982 moves through hyperspace, it narrowly avoids a collision with the TARDIS. As the Third Doctor determines that they are in the 26th century, Jo sees a ship come alongside. Before her eyes, the ship shimmers, changing shape, turning into a Draconian Galaxy-class battlecruiser. The two pilots, Stewart and Hardy, send out a distress signal and prepare for battle. When Hardy goes to get weapons, he meets the Doctor, but sees him and Jo as Draconians. Hardy escorts them at gunpoint to the ship. On Earth, the President and the Draconian ambassador (who is also the Emperor's son) accuse each other of attacking the other's ships and violating the frontier established by treaty between the two empires. General Williams reports to the President that a mission to rescue C982 is being prepared. Williams's hostility against the Draconians is well known ‚Äî it was his actions that started the original war between the two sides and the Prince believes Williams wants war again, a war the Prince warns the President that will see Earth destroyed. News of the attack spreads and anti-Draconian riots break out on Earth, with the opposition calling for the government to take action. Locked up in C982's hold, the Doctor deduces that the strange sound was some kind of sonic hypnosis device that caused Hardy to hallucinate and see what he most feared. As the enemy boarding party burns its way through the airlocks, Hardy gets the Doctor and Jo to use as hostages, but when the airlock door bursts open, the boarders are not Draconians, but Ogrons. The Ogrons' energy weapons stun the two pilots and the Doctor. They then tie Jo up, taking the ship's cargo and the TARDIS as they leave. When the Doctor revives and releases Jo, she tells him what the Ogrons did, and wonders if they are working for the Daleks, as they were when she first met them. The Doctor points out, however, that the Ogrons are mercenaries. When the rescue party arrives, Hardy and Stewart have stopped hallucinating, but with their memories garbled, accuse the Doctor and Jo of being Draconian spies... The two travellers get locked up again as C982 heads back to Earth. General Williams believes they are human agents planted by the Draconians to sabotage any war effort by Earth. He brings the two travellers to confront the Draconian Prince, but the Doctor denies working for the Draconians. He tries to convince the President that a third party is trying to provoke the two empires into war. However, as he can provide no reason why someone would want to, Williams orders the Doctor and Jo be taken away and vows he will get the truth out of them. In the Draconian embassy, the Prince arranges to help Jo and the Doctor \\"escape\\" so that they can be questioned. When the two are escorted from their cell to be brought to the President, a Draconian squad attacks, taking the Doctor prisoner. When Jo tries to get more guards to help, she is arrested instead. The Draconians question the Doctor, believing that he is involved in a plot with Williams to provoke a new war. The Doctor manages to escape the embassy, but is recaptured in the compound by Earth troops. Once back in the cell with Jo, however, she hears the same sound as on C982. Outside, the Ogrons raid the prison, being seen as Draconians thanks to the hypnosound. They break into the Doctor's cell and order him to go with them. The second escape goes no better than the first: the Doctor is recaptured yet again and the Ogrons disappear. This second \\"rescue attempt\\" cements Williams' suspicions, making him demand that the President give him the authority to strike first against the Draconians. The President agrees to break off diplomatic relations but will not go further without conclusive proof. Williams places the Doctor under a mind probe, but it indicates the Doctor is telling the truth. Refusing to believe it, Williams orders increased power, but eventually the probe overloads. The President orders that the Doctor be sent to the Lunar Penal Colony where political prisoners are exiled for life, while Jo remains on Earth. Williams and the President receive records from the Dominion government of Sirius IV, an Earth colony planet that has achieved a degree of autonomy from Earth. The records \\"prove\\" the Doctor and Jo are citizens of Sirius IV as well as career criminals. A commissioner from the Dominion has arrived to claim jurisdiction ‚Äî who is in actuality the Doctor's old enemy, the Master. On the Moon, the Doctor meets Professor Dale of the Peace Party, who shows him around. The Doctor tries to get Dale to trust him and include him in his plans for escape. On Earth, Jo of course recognises the Master immediately, and surmises correctly that he was behind the Ogron attacks. The Master found out about the Doctor and Jo's presence when the Ogrons brought him the TARDIS. Given the unsavoury choice of going with the Master or staying in her cell, Jo agrees to go with him to fetch the Doctor. Despite his fantastic story, Dale believes the Doctor. The peace with the Draconians lasted many years, but suddenly devolved into senseless acts of hostility. The Doctor's story would explain a great deal. Dale outlines the escape plan: Cross, one of the overseers, will leave two spacesuits near an airlock, and they will walk across the lunar surface to steal a spaceship. Dale offers to take the Doctor back to Earth where he can tell his story to Dale's contacts in the press and government. However, once inside the airlock, they find oxygen tanks for the suits are empty. Cross has double-crossed them, and the room is depressurising. At the last moment, the Master arrives and restores the room's atmosphere. The Master obtains custody of the Doctor, and gets the Doctor to come along quietly by revealing that he has Jo. Reunited with Jo in a cell in the Master's ship, the Doctor wonders why he is still alive. The Master explains that his employers are very interested in the Doctor. The Master sets the automatic controls for the Ogron homeworld. Under the cover of telling Jo stories of his life, the Doctor uses a hidden steel wire to file his way through the hinges of the cell. While Jo blocks the security camera and natters on, pretending to continue their conversation, the Doctor sneaks out. Donning a spacesuit, the Doctor exits the ship and makes his way to the flight deck. The Master puts Jo in an airlock, threatening to eject her into space if the Doctor does not surrender, but the Doctor takes him by surprise. As the two face off, they do not notice a Draconian battlecruiser approaching. It docks, and enters the airlock where Jo is located. The Draconian captain informs them that, as all diplomatic relations with Earth have been severed, violating Draconian space is punishable by death. The Doctor says he has vital evidence for the Emperor and asks to speak to him. The captain decides to lock up all three of them and take them back to Draconia. However, the Master secretly activates a device whose signal is picked up by the Ogrons. As the ship arrives on Draconia, the Prince is speaking with his father, asking him for permission to strike first at Earth. The Emperor, like the President, is hesitant, as he knows such a war could bring down both empires. The Doctor, Jo and the Master are presented to the Emperor and the Doctor gives the ritual greeting, \\"My life at your command.\\" The Prince is incensed that the Doctor has the temerity to address the Emperor like a Draconian noble, but the Doctor says that he is a noble of Draconia ‚Äî the title was given him by the 15th Emperor, five centuries before when he aided Draconia against a plague from outer space. The Doctor accuses the Master of trying to instigate a war between Earth and Draconia using Ogrons and the hypnosound device. As the Emperor considers this, a courtier announces that an Earth spaceship has arrived. Jo hears the sound of the sonic device, and realises it is the Ogrons. They burst in, guns blazing, and retreat with the Master, leaving several dead Draconians in their wake. One Ogron has been knocked out by the Doctor, and as the effects of the hypnosound fade, the Emperor sees the \\"Earthman\\" before him transform into its true form. He then realises the Doctor is speaking the truth. The Emperor determines that the Ogron must be shown to the Earth authorities, but as a Draconian ship would be shot down, the Prince, the Doctor and Jo will take the Master's police ship. As they cross the frontier into Earth space, they spot another ship following them. However, by the time they identify it as the Ogron ship, it has already launched its missiles. As the Doctor takes evasive action, the captive Ogron breaks out of its cell, overpowering its Draconian guard. It enters the flight deck and in the struggle cuts the ship's speed. The Prince and the Doctor subdue the Ogron, but the Master's ship catches up and a party boards the police ship. A firefight breaks out on the flight deck, just as an Earth battlecruiser shows up. The Master recalls the boarding party, who take Jo captive along with rescuing the Ogron prisoner, and their ship zips away. The Earth battlercruiser places the Doctor's ship under arrest. Without the Ogron, the President is not convinced. The Doctor suggests an expedition to the Ogron homeworld, but Williams thinks it is a Draconian trick to divide Earth's forces. The Prince expects such a response from Williams -- after all, he started the first war. Williams protests, but the Prince reveals what is in the Draconian court records. Twenty years before, the Draconians sent a battlecruiser to meet the Earth Empire on a diplomatic mission. When the Draconian ship did not answer the Earth ship's hails, Williams gave the order to attack, believing that the Draconian ship was about to attack his damaged vessel. The battlecruiser was unarmed, its missile banks empty, and the reason it did not answer was because its communications systems were destroyed in a neutron storm, the same storm that had damaged Williams's ship. Williams is shaken by the Prince's revelation and apologises for the wrong he had done to the Draconians. Williams now intends to lead the expedition to the Ogron planet himself. The Master brings Jo to a bunker on the Ogron homeworld, where he shows her the TARDIS, which he plans to use as bait for the Doctor in addition to Jo herself. He tries to hypnotise Jo, first with his own powers and then with the hypnosound. However, Jo's mind is strong enough to resist, and the Master orders her to be taken away. An Ogron reports that one of their ships found and attacked two Earth cargo ships, destroying one. The Master is delighted, as this means that war is not far off, and indeed, demands for war from Earth are at a fever pitch. Williams prepares his personal scout ship, with the Doctor and the Prince accompanying and heads at maximum speed to the coordinates the Doctor took from the Master's ship. Jo manages to dig her way into the next, unlocked cell and sneak further into the bunker as Williams's ship enters orbit. She pockets the hypnosound, then finds a pad with the coordinates of the planet and bunker on it and transmits a distress signal with the information. The Master shows up, revealing that the signal was muted, and the only person who could have picked it up was the Doctor, whose ship he detected in orbit around the planet. When the Doctor comes, the trap will be sprung. Williams's crew lands the scout nearby, not knowing the Ogrons have set up an ambush. The Ogrons open fire on the landing party, but are frightened away by an orange, slug-like lizard they call the Eater. The Master is furious, and warns the Ogrons that their masters are coming, which makes them even more terrified than they were of the monster. Williams's party hears the roar of a spaceship landing, and when they look up on the ridge, they see the Master... accompanied by several Daleks, who exterminate Williams's men before they can even fire. The Daleks want to exterminate the Doctor immediately, but the Master proposes that the Doctor be placed in his hands, to be allowed to see the galaxy and Earth in ruins before they kill him. The Gold Dalek agrees, and leaves for its ship, to go and prepare the Dalek army on another planet. Answering the Prince's question, the Doctor explains that the Daleks want a war between Earth and Draconia so both empires will destroy each other, and then the Daleks can pick up the pieces. The Doctor modifies the stolen hypnosound, making the Ogron guard see him as the Gold Dalek, and in fear, it unlocks the gate to the cell. The Doctor tells Williams and the Prince to get the word back to their respective governments and mount a joint expedition against the base on the Ogron planet. The Doctor and Jo find their way to the TARDIS, but are surrounded by the Ogrons and the Master, who trains a blaster on the Doctor. The Doctor activates the hypnosound, panicking the Ogrons. One knocks the Master's arm, making him fire, the shot grazing the Doctor's head. The Master and the Ogrons scatter. The Doctor, barely conscious, asks Jo to help him into the TARDIS. He staggers over to the console, dematerialising the ship then pressing his palms to the telepathic circuits. He is sending a message to the Time Lords. Production The titles for Frontier in Space were prepared, like Carnival of Monsters, with a new arrangement of the theme music performed by Paddy Kingsland on a synthesiser. Known as the \\"Delaware\\" arrangement (the BBC Radiophonic Workshop was based on Delaware Road in west London), it proved unpopular with BBC executives, so the original Delia Derbyshire theme was restored, although an early edit of episode 5 still contains the \\"Delaware\\" music and was used for the VHS release. The 3 Daleks which appear in the final episode were the same props which had been used in Day of the Daleks. The final sequence in the Master's headquarters was intended to contain the giant Ogron-eating monster, but director Paul Bernard did not like the costume and omitted it, leaving the scene with just frightened Ogrons running away from something unseen. Producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks felt the sequence lacked impact and a new ending was filmed in the TARDIS as part of the first production block of the following story, Planet of the Daleks. Frontier in Space was Paul Bernard's last Doctor Who work. Jon Pertwee considered the Draconians to be his favourite monster as the rubber and latex masks used allowed the actors playing them to employ a full range of facial expressions. Recalling the production of this story he noted that filming near the Haywood Gallery at the South Bank was made difficult due to a number of \\"homeless people and drunks\\" lying around the area. According to Pertwee, Paul Bernard asked the stuntmen and actors who were on location in costume as Ogrons to ask these people to move to allow filming to proceed. When the wiping of episodes ended in 1978 it was discovered that episodes 1, 2, 3 & 6 had only survived as black and white telerecordings for overseas sales. In the mid-1980s PAL copies were returned from broadcasters in Australia. =Cast notes= This would be the last appearance of Roger Delgado as the Master, his final scene being the confusion outside the TARDIS with his shooting the Doctor, perhaps accidentally, then disappearing with the panicking Ogrons. Roger Delgado was killed in a car crash in Turkey less than three months after this episode's UK broadcast. John Woodnutt had previously played Hibbert in Spearhead from Space (1970) and would later play the dual roles of Broton and the Duke of Forgill in Terror of the Zygons (1975) as well as Seron in The Keeper of Traken (1981). Luan Peters had previously appeared in The Macra Terror (1967) under her stage name Karol Keyes. Caroline Hunt previously appeared in The Reign of Terror (1964). Louis Mahoney later appeared as Ponti in Planet of Evil (1975) and as Billy Shipton in Blink (2007). Harold Goldblatt had previously appeared with Jon Pertwee in a 1938 radio production in Belfast entitled Lillibullero, which was one of Pertwee's earliest radio performances. A caption slide from the end credits of Episode One was reused accidentally for Episode Two. This resulted in Lawrence Davison (Draconian First Secretary) and Timothy Craven (Cell Guard) not being credited on-screen, though they were billed in Radio Times, and Louis Mahoney (Newscaster) and Roy Pattison (Draconian Space Pilot) - both of whom appeared only in Episode One - being repeated. Broadcast and reception According to the BBC's Audience Research Report, Frontier in Space was well received by viewers at the time of broadcast. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \\"Worthy, very well directed and designed to the hilt with a solid costuming policy for both empires. However, it's obviously padded in parts.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that the story worked \\"brilliantly\\", with the production design \\"[putting] the whole thing on a suitably grand scale\\". In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five and recalled that it was \\"surprising and exciting\\" on first viewing, though in retrospect it seemed to be \\"a lumbering wannabe-epic with screeds of padding, duff cliffhangers and endless scenes of the Doctor and Jo banged up\\". He praised the Draconians and Ogrons, but felt that \\"the fact that the heroes spend perhaps two-thirds of the story locked up is tiresome and cannot be overlooked\\". DVD Talk's John Sinnott noted that the story was \\"talky\\" and had a lot of padding, but that it got \\"much better\\" when the Master was revealed. In the book Doctor Who: The Episode Guide, Mark Campbell awarded it four out of ten, describing it as \\"an overlong and uninteresting space opera‚Äîa genre Doctor Who has never done well. Delgado's exit is particularly badly handled.\\" Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Hulke, was published by Target Books in September 1976 under the title Doctor Who and the Space War. This was the last time Target would give a novelisation a substantially different title than that of the serial on which it was based. The novel abandons the cliffhanger ending of the televised program and has the Doctor simply leaving the Master on the Ogron world to pursue the Daleks. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Geoffrey Beevers was released on CD in February 2008 by BBC Audiobooks. =Home media= The story was released on VHS in August 1995. Episode 5 uses the \\"Delaware\\" music mentioned above. The final episode of this story was also issued on The Pertwee Years VHS release, along with the final episodes of both Inferno (1970) and The D√¶mons (1971). The serial was released on DVD on 5 October 2009 as part of the box set \\"Dalek War\\", alongside Planet of the Daleks. It was released on Blu-ray as part of \\"The Collection - Season 10\\" boxed set in July 2019.

1844January 28, 1911) was an early feminist American author and intellectual who challenged traditional Christian beliefs of the afterlife, challenged women's traditional roles in marriage and family, and advocated clothing reform for women. In 1868, three years after the Civil War ended, she published The Gates Ajar, which depicted the afterlife as a place replete with the comforts of domestic life and where families would be reunited‚Äîalong with family pets‚Äîthrough eternity. In her 40s, Phelps broke convention again when she married a man 17 years her junior. Later in life she urged women to burn their corsets. Her later writing focused on feminine ideals and women's financial dependence on men in marriage. She was the first woman to present a lecture series at Boston University. During her lifetime she was the author of 57 volumes of fiction, poetry and essays. In all of these works, she challenged the prevailing view that woman's place and fulfilment resided in the home. Instead, Phelps' work depicted women as succeeding in nontraditional careers as physicians, ministers, and artists. Near the end of her life, Phelps became very active in the animal rights movement. Her novel, Trixy, published in 1904, was constructed around the topic of vivisection and the effect this kind of training had on doctors. The book became a standard polemic against experimentation on animals.  Early life  Elizabeth (August 31, 1844January 28, 1911) was born in Boston, Massachusetts to American Congregational minister Austin Phelps and Elizabeth Wooster Stuart Phelps (1815‚Äì1852). Her baptismal name was Mary Gray Phelps, after a close friend of her mother's. Her mother wrote the Kitty Brown series of books for girls under the pen name H. Trusta. Her brother, Moses Stuart Phelps, was born in 1849. Her mother was the eldest daughter of Moses Stuart, the eminent president of Andover Theological Seminary. Her mother was intermittentantly ill for most of her adult life and died of brain fever shortly after the birth of their third child, Amos, on November 20, 1852, Then eight years old, Mary Gray asked to be renamed in honor of her mother. Her father Austin Phelps was a widely respected Congregational minister and educator. He was pastor of the Pine Street Congregational Church until 1848, when he accepted a position as the Chair of Rhetoric at Andover Theological Seminary. He met Elizabeth Phelps that same year and they were married in the fall. The family moved to Boston and in 1869 he became President of the Andover Theological Seminary, where he served in that role for 10 years. His writings became standard textbooks for Christian theological education and remain in print today. Two years after her mother' death, Elizabeth's father married her mother's sister, Mary Stuart. She was also a writer but died of tuberculosis only 18 months later. Less than six months later her father married Mary Ann Johnson, the sister to a minister, and they had two sons, Francis Johnson (1860) and Edward Johnson (1863). Phelps received an upper class education, attending the Abbot Academy and Mrs. Edwards' School for Young Ladies. She had a gift for telling stories as a child. One source noted, \\"She spun amazing yarns for the children she played with... and her schoolmates of the time a little farther on talk with vivid interest of the stories she used to improvise for their entertainment. At thirteen, she had a story published in Youth's Companion and other stories appeared in Sunday School publications.  Writing  In most of her writings she used her mother's name \\"Elizabeth Stuart Phelps\\" as a pseudonym, both before and after her marriage in 1888 to Herbert Dickinson Ward, a journalist seventeen years younger. She also used the pseudonym Mary Adams. She gained recognition early in life from prominent literary figures including Thomas Wentworth Higginson and John Greenleaf Whittier. At age 19 she sent a Civil War story titled \\"A Sacrifice Consumed\\" to Harper's Magazine. The magazine editor warmly received her contribution and sent her a generous payment along with a note asking her to write for them again. In 1864 Harpers published her first adult fiction. She then began writing her first books for children which became known as the \\"Tiny series\\". She followed these with the four-volume Gypsy Brenton series, which was later recognized as her best-known juvenile writing. She also published two books that depicted the realistic adventures of a four-year-old boy named Trotty, The Trotty Book (1870) and Trotty's Wedding Tour, and Story- book (1873). Her story \\"The Tenth of January\\" appeared in The Atlantic Monthly in March 1868. It was about the death of scores of girls in the Pemberton Mill collapse and fire in Lawrence, Massachusetts on January 10, 1860.Shelton, Pamela L. Feminist Writers. St. James Press, 1996: 382. = Spiritualist novels = Ward, circa 1910 Ward wrote three Spiritualist novels. The first, The Gates Ajar, became her most famous. It took her two years to write. She wrote later that after she spent more than two years revising it, \\"I could have said it by heart.\\" The book was finally published after the end of the Civil War. In it, she writes about a girl named Mary Cabot, whose brother was killed during the Civil War. The grief-stricken girl becomes convinced that she and her brother will be reunited in an afterlife in which people retain their physical shapes and personalities. The book became very popular, in part from its positive portrayal of death shortly after the Civil War, during which more than 400,000 individuals lost their lives. It also received a great deal of criticism for the way Phelps depicted heaven as less a place to greet God than to be reunited with loved ones. It rejected the traditional Calvinist view of Heaven. The controversy only stimulated sales, and within a few weeks after its release, her publisher sent her a payment for $600 (about $ in today's dollars) and a note, ‚ÄúYour book is moving grandly. It has already reached a sale of 4,000 copies.‚Äù Over 100,000 copies were sold in the United States and England and it was translated and reprinted at least four other languages. She received thousands of letters in response to the first book. She wrote two more books on the same topic, Between the Gates and Beyond the Gates. She then wrote a novella about animal rights titled Loveliness. Phelps said she wrote The Gates Ajar to comfort a generation of women who were devastated by the losses of their loved ones following the Civil War and who found no comfort in traditional religion. Phelps' vision of heaven made the book a run-away best seller. She later built on the success of the first Gates book with a series of other books that featured the word \\"Gates\\" in their titles and which continued to reinforce her views of the afterlife as a place with gardens, comfortable front porches, and finely built houses. The Gates Ajar inspired works by other authors in the following decades, such as Mark Twain's parody \\"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven\\" and Louis H. Pendleton's Wedding Garment: A Tale of the Afterlife. The final novel in the Gates series was also adapted into a stage play in 1901 titled Within the Gates.Phelps, E. S. (2014).

Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. = Advocate for social reform = While writing these and other popular stories, she became an advocate through her lectures and other work for social reform, temperance, and the women's emancipation. She was also involved in clothing reform for women, and in 1874 urged them to burn their corsets. A key influence on her writings on women's rights, especially her beliefs regarding marriage, were the works of John Stuart Mill, such as Mill's 1869 essay The Subjection of Women. Though Phelps was an avid writer on reform issues, she was not actively involved with women's rights organizations or other reform groups of the time. The progressive deterioration of her health from the 1870s onward kept her contributions mostly literary in nature rather than public. In 1877 she published a novel, The Story of Avis, that was ahead of its time. The work focuses on many of the early feminist issues of her era. In it she portrayed a woman's struggle to balance her married life and associated domestic responsibilities with her passion to become a painter. The protagonist is an independent, extraordinary woman in her time who initially decides her goals will not be constrained by marriage and financial dependence on a husband, although she eventually ends up marrying anyhow. She may have been reflecting her mother's life when she described the impossibility of pursuing both her artistic ambitions and adhering to her domestic responsibilities. Elizabeth's novel was largely influenced by Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh. Phelps's unfavorable depiction of men's and women's roles in marriage was controversial. In 1876 Phelps became the first woman to present a lecture series at Boston University. Her presentations were titled \\"Representative Modern Fiction\\" and they analyzed the works of George Eliot.[(1884). Our famous women: An authorized record of the lives and deeds of distinguished American women of our times ... Hartford, Conn.: A. D. Worthington & co.. https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015025877658;view=1up;seq=598] Social advocacy was also incorporated in Phelp's various children's literature publications as she did not attempt to conceal the inequities of the era's class structure. In stories such as \\"Bobbit's Hotel\\", \\"One Way to Get An Education\\", and \\"Mary Elizabeth\\", Phelps directly illustrates the impact of poverty on children. In \\"Bobbit's Hotel\\", the title character dies in an effort to shelter two young orphans. \\"Mary Elizabeth\\" depicts a young homeless girl's choices between theft and begging as a means of survival. \\"One Way to Get An Education\\" depicts a child laborer's desire for a better life than mill work and subsequent decision to self-injure in order to attain an education.Christensen, S. (2012). Elizabeth Stuart Phelps: Trauma and children's literature in the nineteenth century. Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature, 50(1), 75-77. doi:10.1353/bkb.2012.0014 = Later work = Elizabeth Stuart Phelps and her husband co-authored two Biblical romances in 1890 and 1891. Her autobiography, Chapters from a Life was published in 1896 after being serialized in McClure's. She also wrote a large number of essays for Harper's Magazine. Phelps continued to write short stories and novels into the twentieth century. Her novel Trixy (1904) focused on antivivisection, a cause she supported later in life. Writer, feminist, and animal rights advocate Carol J. Adams describes the novel as \\"important and timely.\\" Her last work, Comrades (1911) was published posthumously. Phelps died January 28, 1911, in Newton Center, Massachusetts.Johnson, Deidre (2002). \\"Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward\\". Archived from the original on 2011-05-20.

He was headmaster of Uppingham School (1853‚Äì1887) and founded the Headmasters' Conference in 1869. Life Thring was born at Alford, Somerset, the son of the rector, the Rev John Gale Dalton Thring and Sarah n√©e Jenkyns. He was brother of Theodore Thring (1816-1891), Henry, Lord Thring, a noted jurist and Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury, hymn writer Godfrey Thring, and John Charles Thring, a master at Uppingham School and deviser of the Simplest Game rules for football; he also had two sisters.Family tree in Wells Cathedral: Its Monumental Inscriptions and Heraldry by Jewers Arthur John The family is commemorated in the Church of All Saints, Alford by carved choir seats in the chancel and two memorial windows. Thring was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, where he obtained a Fellowship in 1844. He was ordained in the Church of England in 1846 and served in various curacies until in 1853 he began his true life work by an appointment to the headmastership of Uppingham School. Thring is Uppingham's best-known headmaster, remaining in the post until 1887. He raised the school to a high state of efficiency, and stamped it with the qualities of his own strong personality, as did Thomas Arnold at Rugby. He made many innovative changes to the school's curriculum which were later adopted in other English schools. During his headship the school was forced to move temporarily to Borth in Wales after an outbreak of typhoid ravaged the student body. In 1869, Edward Thring formed the Headmasters' Conference after inviting thirty-seven of his fellow headmasters to meet at his house to consider establishing such an annual meeting. He was an original thinker and writer on education and various educational works.  Thring's methods  Thring was the headmaster of Uppingham between 1853 and 1887; here he turned a poor provincial grammar school of 25 boys into a top public school within ten years. Thring insisted on confining the school to around 300 boys to maintain a small, \\"tight-knit\\" Christian community. Thring believed that every boy was good for something. His early experience teaching Gloucester National elementary schools had convinced him that \\"to teach the slow and ignorant with success is the only test of proficiency and intellectual power.\\" In addition to being a believer in teaching the classics, Thring broadened the overall curriculum at Uppingham by ensuring that the moral, aesthetic, and physical aspects meet the needs of the students. Although Uppingham was a huge achievement in itself, Thring's achievements extended beyond Uppingham as he was co-founder of the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) and he produced his Theory and Practice of Teaching.Hogg, Gordon. \\"The Educational World of Edward Thring/The Rise of the Modern Educational System (Book).\\" Victorian Studies 32.4 (1989): 592. Literary Reference Center Plus. Web. Oct. 3, 2012. Education for the lower classes Thring applied his then liberalism, now it's daughter libertarianism, to the problem of education for those unable to pay fees: > You cannot break the laws of nature which have made the work and powers of > men vary in value. This is what I mean when I ask why should I maintain my > neighbour's illegitimate child ?

Malaysiakini claims that its site now receives over 2.3 million page-views per day on desktop and mobile. Alexa ranked malaysiakini.com as the 13th most popular web site in Malaysia (first in term of online news portal) in 2015.Malaysiakini overtakes Star online rankings In 2013, Malaysiakini's parent company launched two sites - business portal KiniBizKiniBiz official website and internet TV news site KiniTV.KiniTV official website Unlike most news sources in Malaysia, Malaysiakini remains free from government regulation. Its political stand is disputed, as it claims to be pro government but the public and mainstream media have acknowledged it as being pro- opposition. Founding Malaysiakini was founded by Premesh Chandran and Steven Gan in November 1999. Frustrated with constraints on his previous reporting for The Sun, Gan decided to use the Multimedia Super Corridor pledge to create a space for uncensored journalism. The site began with a staff of five journalists and a starting budget of $100,000. Gan served as its editor- in-chief. For its first story, Malaysiakini posted a report on 20 November criticising the practices of Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia's largest-circulation Chinese-language newspaper. Sin Chew Daily had doctored a photograph of Malaysia's ruling party to remove Anwar Ibrahim, who had recently been imprisoned for corruption. According to BBC News, the Malaysiakini report led to \\"worldwide infamy\\" for Sin Chew Daily, and the newspaper later issued a public apology. In April 2001, Malaysiakini made news again when it discovered and reported the secret detention of 10 political activists. Content The Malaysiakini website is updated daily, except for certain public holidays. Its news coverage concentrates mainly on local events, with a strong emphasis on items related to Malaysian politics. Malaysiakini also publishes columns, blogs and features that offer diverse viewpoints, both on local and international issues. Malaysiakini claims to practice an editorial policy that is consistently supportive of justice, human rights, democracy, freedom of speech and good governance. Malaysiakini publishes its readers' opinions in its letters section. The letters section has generated active participation from readers of all races and religions and of various ideological backgrounds, creating an open arena of public debate unseen in Malaysia since the 1960s. Among other common topics are taboo subjects such as migrant workers, AIDS, Islam and racial quota systems. Malaysiakini claims to avoid exercising excessive editorial control on the letters section, as it attempts to foster a spirit of reasoned discussion. Funding In September 2012, Malaysiakini was admitted to receiving grants from National Endowment for Democracy and other organisations. Premesh Chandran, the CEO of Malaysiakini said that Malaysiakini is \\"transparent about such partnerships\\". The foreign grants \\"form a small part of Malaysiakini's budget\\". He also said that Malaysiakini is 70% owned by its co-founders and staff. He claimed that despite receiving grants from international donors, the editorial independence was not compromised. He said about the matter in a statement in response to media reports following controversy over funding provided by National Endowment for Democracy to human rights group such as SUARAM and a host of other organisations, including Malaysiakini. Malaysiakini's former editor YL Chong claimed that George Soros indirectly funded the online news portal and that the online news portal refused to allow this fact to be known and that the former editor resigned in protest. Malaysiankini, of course, refuted these allegations.http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Rencana/20120923/re_03/BISIK- BISIK-Malaysiakini Print version Malaysiakini applied in 2010 for a license to circulate the newspaper in print, which was rejected by the Home Ministry. It successfully appealed in the High Court and the High Court judged that Malaysiakini was to be issued a publication permit. The Home Ministry appealed the High Court decision in the Court of Appeal. The appeal was dismissed. Legally victorious, the newspaper requested the Home Ministry again for a permit. However, the application was rejected again. Awards and recognition In 2001, Malaysiakini won a Free Media Pioneer award from the International Press Institute. Gan himself won a 2000 International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". In July 2001, Businessweek named him one of the \\"Stars of Asia\\" in the category \\"Opinion Shapers\\" for his work with the website. In 2014, it received Social Media Award during Worldwide Bloggers and Social Media Award 2014 in Kuala Lumpur. Controversy Malaysiakini has attracted its fair share of controversy. In March 2001, police in the Malaysian state of Selangor lodged a report against the website for quoting comments questioning the official death toll from racial rioting in the city of Petaling Jaya. In July of the same year, a university student leader filed a report claiming that a letter published on Malaysiakini bearing his name was not written by him. However, the most serious incident occurred on 20 January 2003 when Malaysiakini was raided by the Malaysian police. Four servers and 15 personal computers from its office worth RM150,000 (US$39,500) were seized during the raid. The police raid was instigated after the right-wing cadres in UMNO Youth, an arm of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), complained that a letter written by \\"Petrof\\", a reader, and published on Malaysiakini's website was seditious. In its police report, UMNO Youth claimed that the letter had questioned the special rights and privileges of the Bumiputras that are enshrined in the Constitution. Additionally, UMNO Youth claimed that the letter also contained false allegations that the Malaysian government was unfair to other ethnic races in the country. The seizure of the hardware temporarily silenced Malaysiakini, though it eventually resumed its normal operations. On 1 April 2005, Malaysiakini published a fake news report alleging that four unnamed senior government officials were being charged for corruption. The report turned out to be an April Fool's joke, albeit published with the intention of casting the spotlight on official corruption, a problem still rife in Malaysia. These caused quite a stir in Malaysia with the government ordering a probe on the news organisation. In May 2007, the news portal was sued for defamation by then Chief Minister of Sarawak, Abdul Taib Mahmud in the Kuala Lumpur High Court, an apology, unspecified amount of damages and injunction against Malaysiakini and Gan, for 12 articles between 6 April and 3 May that year. The suit was retracted in January 2012 after the news portal made an apology in public court for publishing unverified news. On 10 April 2015, the news portal published an article in which it claimed that Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) president, Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang supported Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). PAS President Office refuted these allegations a day later as \\"misleading\\". See also * Malaysia Today * The Malaysian Insider * Zulkiflee Anwar Haque References Literature * Chin, James (2003).

He was ambassador to the Netherlands and Spain, and distinguished himself by his opposition to Guizot. Drouyn de Lhuys served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1848 to 1849 in the first government of Odilon Barrot. In Barrot's second government, he was replaced by Alexis de Tocqueville, and was appointed ambassador to Great Britain. He returned briefly as foreign minister for a few days in January 1851, and then returned permanently in the summer of 1852, becoming the first foreign minister of the Second Empire. He resigned his post in 1855, during the Crimean War, when the peace preliminaries he had agreed to in consultation with the British and Austrians at Vienna were rejected by Napoleon III. Drouyn de Lhuys returned to power 7 years later, in 1862, when foreign minister √âdouard Thouvenel resigned over differences with Napoleon on Italian affairs. Drouyn was thus foreign minister in the lead-up to the Austro-Prussian War. He commented that, \\"the Emperor has immense desires and limited abilities. He wants to do extraordinary things but is only capable of extravagances.\\" In the aftermath of that war, which was disastrous to French interests in Europe, Drouyn resigned and withdrew into private life.

The original , is rendered by most English Bible translations, e.g. Douay-Rheims Bible and King James Version, as \\"behold the man\\". The scene has been widely depicted in Christian art.  Artistic subject  Andrea Mantegna, 1500 A scene of the Ecce Homo is a standard component of cycles illustrating the Passion and Life of Christ in art. It follows the Flagellation of Christ, the Crowning with thorns and the Mocking of Christ, the last two often being combined: The usual depiction shows Pilate and Christ, the mocking crowd and parts of the city of Jerusalem. But, from the 15th century, devotional pictures began to portray Jesus alone, in half or full figure with a purple robe, loincloth, crown of thorns and torture wounds, especially on his head. Similar subjects but with the wounds of the crucifixion visible (Nail wounds on the limbs, spear wounds on the sides), are termed a Man of Sorrow(s) (also Misericordia). If the instruments of the Passion are present, it may be called an Arma Christi. If Christ is sitting down (usually supporting himself with his hand on his thigh), it may be referred to it as Christ at rest or Pensive Christ. It is not always possible to distinguish these subjects.  Eastern Christianity  Œôœπ Œßœπ Œå ŒùŒ•ŒúŒ¶ŒäŒüœπ The first depictions of the ecce homo scene in the arts appear in the 9th and 10th centuries in the Syrian-Byzantine culture of the Antiochian Greek Christians. Eastern Orthodox tradition generally refers to this type of icon by a different title: ‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥ (). It derives from the words in , by which Jesus Christ reveals himself, in his Parable of the Ten Virgins according to the Gospel of Matthew, as the bearer of the most high joy. The icon presents the bridegroom as a suffering Christ, mocked and humiliated by Pontius Pilate's soldiers before his crucifixion. The daily Midnight Office summons the faithful to be ready at all times for the day of the Dread Judgement, which will come unexpectedly like \\"a bridegroom in the night\\". On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the first three days of Passion Week, the last week before Pascha, consecrated to the commemoration of the last days of the earthly life of the Saviour, is chanted the troparion \\"Behold the Bridegroom Cometh at Midnight\\" (). A Passion Play, presented in Moscow (27 March 2007) and in Rome (29 March 2007), recalls the words, with which \\"in Holy Scriptures Christ describes Himself as a bridegroom\\":  Western Christianity  Ecce Homo by Titian, between c. 1570 and c. 1576 Depictions of Western Christianity in the Middle Ages, e.g. the Egbert Codex and the Codex Aureus Epternacensis, seem to depict the ecce homo scene (and are usually interpreted as such), but more often than not only show the Crowning of thorns and the Mocking of Christ, which precede the actual ecce homo scene in the Bible. The independent image only developed around 1400, probably in Burgundy, but then rapidly became extremely popular, especially in Northern Europe. Ecce Homo and Mater Dolorosa Diptych, c. 1491‚Äì1520. Aelbrecht Bouts The motif found increasing currency as the Passion became a central theme in Western piety in the 15th and 16th centuries. The ecce homo theme was included not only in the passion plays of medieval theatre, but also in cycles of illustrations of the story of the Passion, as in the Great Passion of Albrecht D√ºrer or the ' of Martin Schongauer. The scene was (especially in France) often depicted as a sculpture or group of sculptures; even altarpieces and other paintings with the motif were produced (e.g. by Hieronymus Bosch or Hans Holbein). Like the passion plays, the visual depictions of the ecce homo scene, it has been argued, often, and increasingly, portray the people of Jerusalem in a highly critical light, bordering perhaps on antisemitic caricatures. Equally, this style of art has been read as a kind of simplistic externalisation of the inner hatred of the angry crowd towards Jesus, not necessarily implying any racial judgment. The motif of the lone figure of a suffering Christ who seems to be staring directly at the observer, enabling him/her to personally identify with the events of the Passion, arose in the late Middle Ages. At the same time similar motifs of the Man of Sorrow and Christ at rest increased in importance. The subject was used repeatedly in later so-called old master prints (e.g. by Jacques Callot and Rembrandt), in the paintings of the Renaissance and the Baroque, as well as in Baroque sculptures. Hieronymus Bosch painted his first Ecce Homo during the 1470s.Kr√©n & Marx. He returned to the subject in 1490 to paint in a characteristically Netherlandish style, with deep perspective and a surreal ghostly image of praying monks in the lower left-hand corner. In 1498, Albrecht D√ºrer depicted the suffering of Christ in the Ecce Homo of his Great Passion in unusually close relation with his self- portrait, leading to a reinterpretation of the motif as a metaphor for the suffering of the artist. James Ensor used the ecce homo motif in his ironic painting Christ and the Critics (1891), in which he portrayed himself as Christ. Antonio Ciseri's 1871 Ecce Homo portrayal presents a semi-photographic view of a balcony seen from behind the central figures of a scourged Christ and Pilate (whose face is not visible). The crowd forms a distant mass, almost without individuality, and much of the detailed focus is on the normally secondary figures of Pilate's aides, guards, secretary and wife. Ecce Homo by Mih√°ly Munk√°csy 1896. One of the more famous modern versions of the Ecce Homo motif was that by the Polish artist Adam Chmielowski, who went on to found, as Brother Albert, the Albertine Brothers () and, a year later, the Albertine Sisters (), eventually becoming proclaimed a saint on 12 November 1989 by Pope John Paul II, the author of ', a play about Chmielowski, written between 1944‚Äì1950, when the future Pontiff and later himself a saint was a young priest. (146 cm x 96.5 cm, unsigned, painted between 1879 and 1881), was significant in Chmielowski's life, as it is in Act 1 of Wojty≈Ça's play. Pope John Paul II is said to have kept a copy of this painting in his apartment at the Vatican. The original can be viewed in the Ecce Homo Sanctuary of the Albertine Sisters in Krak√≥w.. It was painted at a time when the painter was going through an inner struggle, trying to decide whether to remain an artist, or to give up painting to pursue the calling to minister to the poor. Especially in the 19th and 20th centuries, the meaning of ecce homo motif has been extended to the portrayal of suffering and the degradation of humans through violence and war. Notable 20th-century depictions are George Grosz's (1922‚Äì1923) and Lovis Corinth's Ecce Homo (1925). The 84 drawings and 16 watercolors of Grosz criticize the socio-political conditions of the Weimar Republic. Corinth shows, from the perspective of the crowd, Jesus, a soldier, and Pilate dressed as a physician. Following the Holocaust of World War II, Otto Dix portrayed himself, in Ecce Homo with self-likeness behind barbed wire (1948), as the suffering Christ in a concentration camp.

AIMS was a standards-based assessment aligned with the Arizona Academic Content Standards. In November 2014, the Arizona State Board of Education voted to replace AIMS with a new test called AzMERIT. (Arizona's Measurement of Educational Readiness to Inform Teaching)http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2014/11/03/arizona- board-votes-new-test-replace-aims/18419021/ Test contents The content of AIMS varied by grade level, but it usually featured three reading and mathematics sections, as well as a writing portion, where students were assigned to write an essay based on a prompt given to them. For some grade levels, the test included a science portion in lieu of a writing section. High School Graduation To graduate from an Arizona public high school, a student had to meet the AIMS High School Graduation Requirement. The most common way to meet this requirement was to pass the writing, reading, and mathematics content areas of the AIMS HS test. High school students had multiple opportunities to take and pass these content areas. For students who did not pass all three required content areas of the AIMS HS test, there were alternative methods for meeting the AIMS High School Graduation requirement. This requirement was dropped after the test was replaced by the AzMERIT test. AIMS scholarships Additionally, starting with the class of 2006, high- school students in Arizona who exceeded all three standards in reading, writing, and math may have been eligible for a scholarship to any of the three public state universities if they also met certain other criteria. Students must have completed all 16 core competency courses (4 units English, 4 units Math, 3 units Lab Science, 2 units Social Science, 2 units Foreign Language, and 1 unit Fine Arts) by graduation with a B or better in each course. Students must have also met at least one of the following academic requirements: A cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher on an unweighted 4.0 scale, or rank in the top 5% of their graduating class. If a student did not exceed standards on all three tests, they may have still qualified for a scholarship if they exceeded standards on two of the AIMS sections and met standards on the other section. Additionally, they would have either needed to receive at least a score of 3 on two Advanced Placement tests or at least a score of 4 on two International Baccalaureate exams. Qualified students would receive a full state university tuition waiver valid for one year following graduation from high school. The scholarship was renewable for four years based upon university-determined criteria. The actual dollar amount of the scholarship varied based upon the tuition charged by the state university in which they enrolled. On September 23, 2010, the Arizona Board of Regents voted 9-1 to cut AIMS scholarships to just 25% of freshman year tuition, stating that the scholarship was too easy to earn.http://azstarnet.com/news/local/education/college/article_c5facfdb-13a0-5f0a-b205-f45f5bfc3307.html Students also hade to have an ACT score of at least 28 or an SAT-1 score of at least 1300 (i.e. the reading and mathematics scores must have been at least 1300).

In ancient times, Sabaeans inhabited Ma'rib, the capital city of the Kingdom of Saba' in modern- day Yemen. Their lands were irrigated by the Ma'rib Dam, which is thought by some to have been one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world because of its size. When the dam collapsed for the third time in the 1st century CE, much of the Azd tribe left Marib and dispersed. Azd branches In the 3rd century CE the Azd branched into four sub-branches, each led by one of the sons of Amr bin Muzaikiyya. =Imran Bin Amr= Imran bin Amr and the bulk of the tribe went to Oman, where they established the Azdi presence in Eastern Arabia. Later they invaded Karaman and Shiraz in Southern Persia, and these came to be known as \\"Azd Daba\\". Another branch headed west back to Yemen, and a group went further west all the way to Tihamah on the Red Sea. This group was to become known as \\"Azd Uman\\" after the emergence of Islam. =Jafna bin Amr= Jafna bin Amr and his family headed for Syria, where he settled and initiated the kingdom of the Ghassanids. They were so named after a spring of water where they stopped on their way to Syria. This branch was to produce: * The Ghassanid dynasty in Syria * A Roman Emperor (Philip the Arab, a Ghassanid Arab from Syria, who ruled 244‚Äì249 CE) * A Byzantine dynasty (the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian, also known as the Syrian, ruled 717-741 CE) =Thalabah bin Amr= Thalabah bin Amr left his tribe Al-Azd for the Hijaz and dwelt between Thalabiyah and Dhi Qar. When he gained strength, he headed for Yathrib, where he stayed. Of his seed are the great Aws and Khazraj, sons of Haritha bin Thalabah. These were to be the Muslim Ansar and were to produce the last Arab dynasty in Spain (the Nasrids). =Haritha bin Amr= Haritha bin Amr led a branch of the Azd Qahtani tribes. He wandered with his tribe in the Hijaz until they came to the Tihamah. He had three sons Adi, Afsa and Lahi. Adiy was the father of Bariq, Lahi the father of Khuza'a and Afsa, the father of Aslam.

The shortage of water prompted them to relocate to Al-Bahah in the Arabian Peninsula. Today members of the Zahran tribe can be found all over the Middle East and beyond. According to Arab scholars, the dialect used by the Hejazi tribes, the Zahran and the Ghamid, is the closest to classical Arabic. Azd 'Uman The Azd 'Uman were the dominant Arab tribe in the eastern realms of the Caliphate and were the driving force in the conquest of Fars, Makran and Sindh.Wink pg 51-52;\\"It is not accident that, among the Arabs, the Tribe of the Azd 'Uman were instrumental in the conquest of Fars, Makran and Sind, and that for some time they became the dominant Arab tribe in the eastern caliphate.\\" They were the chief merchant group of Oman and Al-Ubulla, who organized a trading diaspora with settlements of Persianized Arabians on the coasts of Kirman and Makran, extending into Sindh since the days of Ardashir. They were strongly involved in the western trade with India and with the expansion of the Muslim conquests they began to consolidate their commercial and political authority on the eastern frontier. During the early years of the Muslim conquests the Azdi ports of Bahrain and Oman were staging grounds for Muslim naval fleets headed to Fars and Hind. From 637 CE the conquests of Fars and Makran were dominated by the Azdi and allied tribes from Oman. Between 665 CE and 683 CE the Azdi 'Uman became especially prominent due in Basra on account of favors from Ziyad ibn Abihi, the Governor of Muawiya I, and his son Ubaidullah. When a member of their tribe Abu Said Al- Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra became governor their influence and wealth increased as he extended Muslim conquests to Makran and Sindh, where so many other Azdi were settled. After his death in 702, though, they lost their grip on power with the rise of Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf as governor of Iraq. Al-Hajjaj pursued a systematic policy of breaking Umayyad power, as a result of which the Azdi also suffered.

The major feature of the park is Bear Creek Canyon and its generous sandstone outcroppings. Activities in the park include canoeing, rock climbing, fishing, and hiking. The park sits at Milepost 304 of Natchez Trace Parkway, a scenic road operated by the National Park Service commemorating the historical Natchez Trace. Geography The park pays tribute to Tishomingo County's remarkable geography of massive rock formations, found here and in the immediately surrounding areas and nowhere else in Mississippi. The cliffs, valleys and abundant outcroppings of carboniferous sandstone and limestone represent the southwestern extremity of the Southern Appalachian Plateau. The boulders and towering cliffs of Hartselle Sandstone, together with the outcrops of Bangor Limestone and the creek which carves through it all, compose \\"some of the most picturesque and rugged scenery in the state.\\" Indigenous history The park is named for one of the last great Chickasaw leaders, Chief Tishu Miko, born not far from here in Lee County, Mississippi, around 1735. Modern Chickasaw occasionally make pilgrimage to the park to visit the areas where the famous Chief fished and hunted. Chief Tishomingo (the modern form of his name) served a brilliant career in the US Military, distinguishing himself in such actions as the Battle of Fallen Timbers, the Red Stick Rebellion and the War of 1812. His influence became powerful and extended into Washington, DC. He was a principal signatory to a number of important treaties, including the Treaty of Pontotoc in 1832 (negotiated at great length with Andrew Jackson but never ratified by the Senate). His most momentous and perhaps most difficult signature was put to the 1837 Treaty of Doaksville, which he affirmed only under heavy political pressure. This document, in large part a lease agreement with the Choctaw Nation, incidentally compelled the removal of the last Chickasaw from this area to the Indian Territory in Oklahoma. It is believed that, in May 1838, Chief Tishomingo succumbed to smallpox at the advanced age of 104, near Little Rock on the Trail of Tears. His burial site is unknown. The park's importance to Native American history extends even beyond the historical Chickasaw Nation, as archaeological excavations confirm the presence of Paleo Indians in the area now encompassed by the park as early as 7000 B.C. The ancient tribes were able to produce excellent tools from the high-quality chert and limestone that was available here, and ceramic pottery from clay dug from the hills. The park's swinging bridge Park history The park was among those constructed in Mississippi by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. CCC Company 3497 began work creating the park in April 1935; the park opened to the public in May 1939. Many of the original facilities are extant, including several buildings, trails, picnic tables, campgrounds, cabins and a fishing pond used by the CCC workers themselves. The rustic quality of the CCC structures resulted from the use of native materials, their original designs, and the craftsmanship of the builders. While most of the facilities in Mississippi were built of wood, Tishomingo and Wall Doxey state parks feature substantial use of stone construction. Attractions Outcroppings Trail Tishomingo State Park offers visitors seven hiking trails that range in length from ¬æ to 3 miles and in difficulty from easy to moderate. The trails feature scenic natural springs, waterfalls, rocky creeks and streams, cliffs, rock walls and huge outcrops. The terrain suggests mountains, and indeed this is a part of the Appalachian range, but the hills here are no higher than about 660 feet. Rock climbing, which requires a helmet and a free permit (available at the park office), is a popular activity on the trails, particularly at the formation known as Jean's Overhang. Bear Creek is encountered at a number of points by the trail system, and can itself be explored by canoe on one of the float trips offered here. Three popular disc golf courses are available, and an Olympic-sized outdoor swimming pool is open during late spring and summer. The park provides a number of lodging options including 15 primitive campsites, two primitive Scout campsites, 62 developed RV campsites, which offer water and electricity, and seven furnished cabins. The park's Nature Center, which re-opened in 2016, offers displays of Tishomingo county heritage, nature, art, animals, arrowheads and memorabilia from the Civilian Conservation Corps.

Overview Laviolette Bridge is the only bridge that spans the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City; therefore, it provides an important connection between the North and South shores of the river. The bridge, an impressive structure with elegant aesthetics, has become a major landmark of Trois-Rivi√®res and the Mauricie region. Approximately 40,000 vehicles cross the bridge each day. History Popular demand for a bridge had existed since the late 19th century. The construction of Laviolette Bridge did not start until 1964. On September 8, 1965, an explosion led to the bursting of a caisson because of water pressure, causing the death of twelve workers. The bridge was inaugurated on December 20, 1967 by Fernand Lafontaine, the ministre de la voirie (minister of highways) of the government of Daniel Johnson, Sr. It thus replaced the former ferry system in place. The name honours the founder of Trois-Rivi√®res, the Sieur de Laviolette. In 2005, the Ministry of Transport of Qu√©bec began a three-year major renovation project, which caused major traffic jams throughout the summer of 2005, when the middle of the bridge was repaired. In 2006, the northern end was redone, followed by the southern end in 2007.

The city was part of the Klaipƒóda Region and ethnographic Lithuania Minor. ≈†ilutƒó was the interwar capital of ≈†ilutƒó County and is currently the capital of ≈†ilutƒó District Municipality. Name ≈†ilutƒó's origin dates to an inn (Krug, locally karƒçema) catering to travelers and their horses which was located halfway between Memel (Klaipƒóda) and Tilsit (Til≈æƒó). The German name of Heydekrug referred to a Krug (an archaic word for inn) in the Heide (heathland). The inn was known for being in the region where most people spoke the Memelland-Samogitian dialect ≈†ilokarƒçema. History A famous fish market was opened in ≈†ilutƒó almost 500 years ago, when Georg Tallat purchased the inn together with the land and fishing rights in 1511. The town was a gathering place for peasants from nearby Samogitia and Curonian and Prussian fishermen from Rusnƒó, , Nida, and . Next to the inn a church of Werden (Verdainƒó) was built in 1550. Heydekrug often sought city rights, but was opposed by Memel and Tilsit in 1721 and 1725. In 1722 Heydekrug became a district center and in 1818 the capital of Landkreis Heydekrug. The settlement was amalgamated with the villages of Werden (Verdainƒó), Szibben (≈Ωibai), and Cynthionischken (Cintjoni≈°kiai) in 1910, although it still did not receive city rights. Following World War I, the town became part of Lithuania when it acquired the Klaipƒóda Region in 1923. Post office of ≈†ilutƒó (1905) Living home The town was reclaimed by Nazi Germany in 1939 when it reacquired the Memel Territory. In 1941 the town finally received city rights. During World War II, the Stalag Luft VI prisoner-of-war camp was located near Heydekrug; it was the northernmost POW camp within the confines of the German Reich. There remain many old buildings in ≈†ilutƒó: an old post office (1905), a fire station (1911), a court building and prison (1848), a bridge across the Sziesze (≈†y≈°a) (1914), an estate of H. Scheu (1818), an old market square, a harbor, railway station and a bridge (1875), and the Vyd≈´nas gymnasium. Economy The town, which is a regional center, has a well-developed infrastructure. There is an amateur theatre, a museum, three churches, a few hotels, and many caf√©s, restaurants, and bars. There are large industrial enterprises in ≈†ilutƒó as well: ≈†ilutƒós Rambynas (1842), producing butter and cheese, is one of the oldest factories in the area; ≈†ilutƒós Baldai (1890); and ≈†ilutƒós Durpƒós (1882) which exports approximately 50,000 m3 of peat. Newly founded enterprises are also prospering: ≈†ilutƒós Girnos (combined fodder); ≈Ωibai; Grabupƒóliai (meat processing); and EKSA, a subsidiary of the alcohol producer Stumbras.

The palace is located on a leafy, riverside sprawl of hills on the banks of the Brunei River, a few kilometres southwest of Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei's capital city. The palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It is considered to be the world's largest private residence in terms of floor area, earning it the title of \\"world's largest residential palace\\". Design and construction The name \\"Istana Nurul Iman\\" is taken from Malay Istana and Arabic Nur-ol Imaan and means Palace of the Light of Faith. It was designed by Filipino Visayan architect Leandro V. Locsin, who utilized the architectural motif of golden domes and vaulted roofs to echo Brunei's Islamic and Malay influences. The interior of the palace was designed by Khuan Chew, Design Principal of KCA International, whose other works include the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. Construction was handled by Ayala Abbott and Butters, a UK construction firm, and completed in 1984 at a total cost of around US$1.4 billion. World's largest palace The title of the \\"world's largest palace\\" is difficult to ascertain, and controversial, as different countries use their own unique standard to claim that their palace is the largest. Using various definitions, a number of palaces are claimed to be the world‚Äôs largest: Istana Nurul Iman, Buckingham Palace, Quirinal Palace, Royal Palace of Madrid, Stockholm Palace, The Forbidden City, The Palace of Versailles, The Royal Palace of Caserta, The Winter Palace, The Louvre Palace, Prague Castle, The Grand Palace and The Palace of the Parliament. To be considered for the Guinness World Record, the palace must have been intended for use as a royal residence, and only the combined area of the palace‚Äôs indoor floors (a measurement commonly known as floorspace) is considered. As measured by these standards, Guinness World Records currently considers Istana Nurul Iman to hold the title as the \\"world's largest residential palace.\\" Upon completion, Istana Nurul Iman became the largest residential palace in the world and the largest single-family residence ever built.Guinness World Records The palace contains 1,788 rooms, which includes 257 bathrooms, a banquet hall that can be expanded to accommodate up to 5,000 guests, a mosque accommodating 1,500 people.Bartholomew, James. The Richest Man in the World, Penguin Books Ltd; New Ed edition (22 February 1990). , The palace also includes a 110-car garage, an air conditioned stable for the Sultan's 200 polo ponies, and five swimming pools. In total, Istana Nurul Iman contains 2,152,782 square feet (200,000 m¬≤) of floorspace. Istana Nurul Iman has 564 chandeliers, 51,000 light bulbs, 44 stairwells and 18 elevators. Functions The Sultan takes his official audiences at the palace. The palace is also used for all the state functions of the government of Brunei. In addition, the palace houses the prime minister's office, and serves as the seat of the Brunei government. In addition to audience and state rooms, there is a throne chamber used for various formal occasions such as the proclamation of the crown prince and the annual birthday investiture. However, in keeping with its primary use as the Sultan‚Äôs personal residence, the palace is the home to Sultan‚Äôs 7000 cars in 110 separate garages, which include 365 Ferraris, 275 Lamborghinis, 258 Aston Martins, 172 Bugattis, 230 Porsches, 350 Bentleys, 600 Rolls Royces, 440 Mercedes Benzes, 265 Audis, 237 BMWs, 225 Jaguars and 183 Land Rovers, most of which are custom-made. Accessibility The palace is not open to the public except on the annual Islamic celebration of Hari Raya Aidilfitri (the festival at the end of the Muslim fasting month) when the palace receives about 110,000 visitors over a three-day period where the guests receive gifts of food as well as green packets containing money for young children. The palace is also open to Muslims during 10 days of the Ramadhan period for Tadarus and Tarawih prayer gathering.

James began DJing in New Jersey, in the mid-1980s. His pseudonym, the 45 King, came from his ability to make beats using obscure 45 RPM records. Career The 45 King first gained fame with his breakbeat track \\"The 900 Number\\" in 1987. The song featured a looping of a baritone sax solo from Marva Whitney's \\"Unwind Yourself\\" (1968). The 45 King signed with Tuff City Records that year and was given a production deal. \\"The 900 Number\\" remains his signature work, having been resampled by many artists. He was also featured on the 1989-Hustlers Convention album on the UK label Music of Life, which is considered by many to be hip-hop's first-ever live album. Using his popularity from the previous release, the 45 King was able to help the other members of his crew, dubbed the Flavor Unit, which included many well-known hip-hop acts including Chill Rob G, Lakim Shabazz, Apache, and Queen Latifah. The 45 King's big break came when Queen Latifah signed with Tommy Boy Records in 1989 and released the album All Hail the Queen. The 45 King did extensive production on this album, and it is considered by critics to be among his best production work. Over the next few years, many other Flavor Unit members also signed with Tommy Boy, and the 45 King frequently contributed to their albums with his productions. In November 1989, the re-release of \\"The King is Here\\" / \\"The 900 Number\\" peaked at #60 in the UK Singles Chart, his only appearance in a UK chart. In the early 1990s, drug addiction took its toll on the 45 King's career, which caused him to lose a production deal that he signed with Warner Bros. Records. Around this time the 45 King released multiple series of breakbeat records (the Lost Breakbeat series, the Breakapalooza series, etc.) and remixed Madonna's Top-10 single \\"Keep It Together\\", but he stayed mainly with his breakbeat record franchises. In July 1990, Manchester-born DJ Chad Jackson sampled \\"The 900 Number\\" on his single \\"Hear the Drummer (Get Wicked)\\", which reached #3 in the UK Singles Chart. A remixed version was also a minor UK hit in 2007. Jackson was apparently unaware that the song had itself been sampled from the original \\"Unwind Yourself\\", as he credited himself, and King, as co- writers of the song. In 1996, Washington, D.C.-based go-go artist DJ Kool had a hit with the song \\"Let Me Clear My Throat\\". It was a call-and-response vocals over a chopped half of the \\"900 Number\\" beat. DJ Kool did not just sample the track: he also acknowledged the 45 King as the song's originator, and the 45 King remixed the track for Kool. In 1998, the 45 King produced \\"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\\" for Jay-Z. The song was a hit that featured a looped chorus from the original cast album of the Broadway musical Annie. Jay-Z also did an interview when he spoke about how important the 45 King has been to hip hop music and considers him a true pioneer of the business. In 2000, he produced the platinum-certified track \\"Stan\\" for Eminem.

Career =Club career= The current Northern Ireland Under-19 coach, originally from West Belfast, began his football career as a goalkeeper with little-known Down and Connor League side team St. Agnes', before moving on to play as an outfield player for works team Post Office Social Club. After barely six months, he was on the move again, this time joining Amateur League side Cromac Albion, where his blossoming talent was spotted by then Larne boss Brian Halliday. Donaghy's rapid rise in the game continued when, after just 20 matches with the Inver Park club, he was transferred to Luton Town in June 1978 for a fee of ¬£20 000. He spent 10 years at Luton Town, overseeing the most successful era of their history to date. He collected a Second Division title winner's medal in 1982, enabling him to experience First Division football for the first time yet. He helped Luton retain their First Division status, and was a key part of the team that finished a club record high of seventh in the 1986‚Äì87 season. In 1987‚Äì88, he helped Luton win their first major trophy as they achieved a shock 3‚Äì2 win over Arsenal in the 1988 Football League Cup Final. In October 1988, Donaghy departed from Kenilworth Road in a ¬£650,000 move to his boyhood heroes Manchester United. It was at the time a big risk for Alex Ferguson to pay out a large sum of money for a 31-year-old, but Donaghy repaid the United manager's faith in him with some consistent performances in not only his favoured central defensive position but also as a full-back. Immediately after joining United, Donaghy was the club's first-choice left-back for the 1988‚Äì89 season, missing only the League Cup game for which he was cup-tied. However, his opportunities were limited in the 1989‚Äì90 season, and he was unable to make even the substitutes bench for the 1990 FA Cup Final triumph over Crystal Palace. However, he did make the substitutes bench for the European Cup Winners' Cup triumph in 1990‚Äì91. United were First Division runners-up in 1991‚Äì92 and won their first-ever League Cup, but Donaghy's first-team chances continued to be restricted and he was also left out of the side that beat Nottingham Forest in the League Cup final. His next move was in August 1992 when, just a month short of his 35th birthday, Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield paid ¬£100,000 for his services. Donaghy helped Chelsea finish 11th in the inaugural Premier League season and helped them reach the FA Cup final in 1993‚Äì94, although he did not make the squad for the team that lost 4‚Äì0 to Double-winners Manchester United. At the end of that season, Donaghy announced his retirement from club football. He made his final appearance for Northern Ireland against Mexico in Miami in June 1994, three months before his 37th birthday. Shortly after his playing career ended, Donaghy returned to the province with his family and after a brief spell as manager at Newry Town, he had stints as a coach with Cliftonville and as a Youth Development Officer back on his home patch with Donegal Celtic. In 2000, he was appointed to his present position as coach for the Northern Ireland Under-19 team. His son Ciaran currently plays for Carrick Rangers. =International career= The first of his 91 caps came in May 1980 at Windsor Park in the 1‚Äì0 Home International Championship victory over Scotland. He further enhanced his reputation during the 1982 and 1986 World Cup finals. In the former tournament, he played in four of Northern Ireland's five games. He was sent off after 60 minutes of the famous 1‚Äì0 win over Spain in Valencia, for the offence of shoving Spain's Jos√© Antonio Camacho, but returned for Northern Ireland's final match, the 4‚Äì1 defeat by France in Madrid.

Like many of the other trilobite orders, Corynexochida contains many species with widespread characteristics. The middle region of the cephalon (the glabella) is typically elongate, with the sides often spreading forward (pestle-shaped). Some species have glabellae that are effaced, meaning they are smooth and show little detail. The glabellar furrows (when not effaced) typically have a splayed arrangement. In most species, the hind pair on either side of the cephalon become spines that point sharply backwards, and the spinose tips of the anterior pairs of thoracic segments tend to become more and more forward directed toward the pygidium. The eyes are typically large. Pygidia are typically large, competing in size with the cephalon in some species. The tips of the thoracic segments of many Corynexochida species are spine-like (though in some species they are flush with the sides and smooth). The thorax can have 2-12 segments (rarely more), but they more typically have 7-8. References * Order Corynexochida - a site about the eight orders of trilobites.

Basic process The basic process of wayfinding involves four stages: # Orientation is the attempt to determine one's location, in relation to objects that may be nearby and the desired destination. # Route decision is the selection of a course of direction to the destination. # Route monitoring is checking to make sure that the selected route is heading towards the destination. # Destination recognition is when the destination is recognized.Lidwell, William, Kritina Holden and Jill Butler. Universal Principles of Design. (Rockport Publishers, Beverly, MA, 2010) p. 260. Historical Historically, wayfinding refers to the techniques used by travelers over land and sea to find relatively unmarked and often mislabeled routes. These include but are not limited to dead reckoning, map and compass, astronomical positioning and, more recently, global positioning. Wayfinding can also refer to the traditional navigation method used by indigenous peoples of Polynesia.Polynesian Voyaging Society (2009) The ancient Polynesians and Pacific Islanders mastered the methods of wayfinding to explore and settle on the islands of the Pacific, many using devices such as the Marshall Islands stick chart. With these skills, some of them were even able to navigate the ocean as well as they could navigate their own land. Despite the dangers of being out at sea for a long time, wayfinding was a way of life.Daniel Lin, \\"Hokulea: The Art of Wayfinding (Interview with a Master Navigator),\\" National Geographic website, 3 March 2014, retrieved on 29 October 2014. Today, The Polynesian Voyaging Society tries-out the traditional Polynesian ways of navigation. In October 2014, the crew of the Hokule ªa arrived on another island in Tonga. Modern usage of the term Recently, wayfinding has been used in the context of architecture to refer to the user experience of orientation and choosing a path within the built environment. Kevin A. Lynch used the term (originally \\"way-finding\\") for his 1960 book The Image of the City, where he defined way-finding as \\"a consistent use and organization of definite sensory cues from the external environment.\\" In 1984 environmental psychologist Romedi Passini published the full-length \\"Wayfinding in Architecture\\" and expanded the concept to include the use of signage and other graphic communication, visual clues in the built environment, audible communication, tactile elements, including provisions for special-needs users. The wayfinding concept was further expanded in a further book by renowned Canadian graphic designer Paul Arthur, and Romedi Passini, published in 1992, \\"Wayfinding: People, Signs and Architecture.\\" The book serves as a veritable wayfinding bible of descriptions, illustrations, and lists, all set into a practical context of how people use both signs and other wayfinding cues to find their way in complex environments. There is an extensive bibliography, including information on exiting information and how effective it has been during emergencies such as fires in public places.Originally published 1992, McGraw Hill, reissued in a limited commemorative edition in 2002 by SEGD. Wayfinding also refers to the set of architectural or design elements that aid orientation. Today, the term wayshowing, coined by Per Mollerup,Per Mollerup, Wayshowing, A Guide to Environmental Signage (Lars Muller Publisher) is used to cover the act of assisting way finding.Per Mollerup, Wayshowing>Wayfinding: Basic & Interactive (BIS Publishers) describes the difference between wayshowing and way finding, and codifies the nine wayfinding strategies we all use when navigating in unknown territories. However, there is some debate over the importance of using the term wayshowing, some argue that it merely adds confusion to a discipline that is already highly misunderstood. In 2010 AHA Press Published \\"WAYFINDING FOR HEALTHCARE Best Practices for Today's Facilities\\", written by Randy R. Cooper. The book takes a comprehensive view of Wayfinding specifically for those in search of medical care.AHA Press, Health Forum Inc., An American Hospital Association Company ‚Äì Chicago Whilst wayfinding applies to cross disciplinary practices including architecture, art and design, signage design, psychology, environmental studies, one of the most recent definitions by Paul Symonds et al. defines wayfinding as \\"The cognitive, social and corporeal process and experience of locating, following or discovering a route through and to a given space\\". Wayfinding is an embodied and sociocultural activity in addition to being a cognitive process in that wayfinding takes place almost exclusively in social environments with, around and past other people and influenced by stakeholders who manage and control the routes through which we try to find our way. The route is often one we might take for pleasure, such as to see a scenic highway, or one we take as a physical challenge such as trying to find the way through a series of caves showing our behavioural biases. Wayfinding is a complex practice that very often involves several techniques such as people-asking (asking people for directions) and crowd following and is thus a practice that combines psychological and sociocultural processes. In addition to the built environment, the concept of wayfinding has also recently been applied to the concept of career development and an individual's attempt to create meaning within the context of career identity. This was addressed in late August, 2017 in the NPR podcast You 2.0: How Silicon Valley Can Help You Get Unstuck. The wayfinding concept is also similar to information architecture, as both use information-seeking behaviour in information environments. Tate, a UX designer, pointed out in his blogpost the language used when interacting with computers is thought of spatially, like ‚Äúbrowsing the web, surfing the net, going home, etc‚Äù. He focuses on showing how Lynch‚Äôs model can be applied to information environments, which are places users go ‚Äúto satisfy an information need‚Äù. He shows how berrypicking is very much about wayfinding, as when people go from A to B they pick up new pieces of information along the way, to confirm they are moving in the right direction.  Wayfinding Theory  In Lynch's The Image of the City, he created a model of cities as a framework on which to build wayfinding systems. The 5 elements are what he found people use to orient themselves with a mental map. They are: * Paths - the roads used to move around * Edges - roads which define the boundaries and breaks in continuity * Districts - areas which share similar characteristics * Nodes - strong intersection points of roads like squares or junctions * Landmarks - easily identifiable entities which are used for point-referencing, usually physical objects Expanding on Mollerup's nine wayfinding strategies mentioned above, they are: * Track following: to rely on directional signs on the road * Route following: to follow the rules given, such as a pre-planned route before the journey started * Educated seeking: to use past experiences to draw logical conclusions on where to go * Inference: to apply norms and expectations of where things are * Screening: to systematically search the area for a helpful clue, though there may well not be any * Aiming: to find a perceptible target and move in that specific direction * Map reading: to use portable or stationary maps and help the user locate themselves * Compassing: to navigate oneself with a figurative compass, such as the location of the sun or a landmark * Social navigation: to follow the crowd and learn from other people‚Äôs actions Going further with the cognitive process, understanding it helps to build a better wayfinding system as designers learn how people navigate their way around and how to use those elements. Chris Girling uses a cyclical model to explain how our decisions and actions change as we move. ‚ÄúOur brains are constantly sensing information, co-ordinating movement, remembering the environment and planning next steps‚Äù. The model shows how our perception can influence what information we seek out, such as some signage being too small to read or even too high up. Once we find the information we want, we make a decision which will depend on previous experiences. Finally we move, during which we look for more information to confirm that we made the right decision for our journey. The cognitive load of this will vary from person to person, as some will know the journey well while it is new to others. This understanding helps designers develop empathy for the user, as they research and test various wayfinding systems adapted to each context. Wayfinding in architecture, signage and urban planning Passengers walk past signs at Newark Airport. Large facilities with high tourist volumes may invest significantly in wayfinding and signage programs. Modern wayfinding has begun to incorporate research on why people get lost, how they react to signage and how these systems can be improved. =Urban planning= An example of an urban wayfinding scheme is the Legible London Wayfinding system. Nashville, Tennessee has introduced a live music wayfinding plan. Posted outside each live music venue is a guitar pick reading Live Music Venue. =Indoor wayfinding= Indoor wayfinding in public buildings such as hospitals is commonly aided by kiosks, Raven, A., Laberge, J., Ganton, J. & Johnson, M., Wayfinding in a Hospital: Electronic Kiosks Point the Way, UX Magazine 14.3, September 2014. indoor maps, and building directories. Such spaces that involve areas outside the normal vocabulary of visitors show the need for a common set of language-independent symbols. Offering indoor maps for handheld mobile devices is becoming common, as are digital information kiosk systems. thumb Other frequent wayfinding aids are the use of color coding and signage clustering -- used to order the information into a hierarchy and prevent the issue of information overload. A number of recent airport terminals include ceiling designs and flooring patterns that encourage passengers to move along the required directional flow.Menno Hubregtse, Wayfinding, Consumption, and Air Terminal Design (London: Routledge, 2020). Some terminals include artworks as landmarks for orientation. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) represented a milestone in helping to make spaces universally accessible and improving wayfinding for users. =Signage= Signage is the most visual part of wayfinding. A good wayfinding system needs well designed signage, but it also has to be well placed and to match the user‚Äôs language. There are four types of signs most commonly used which help navigate users and give them appropriate information. They are: * Informational: These provide useful information on the place where the users are, such as free wifi, opening hours, etc. * Directional: As the name indicates, these direct users with arrows saying which way to go for whichever purpose. These most often at junctions when the user must make a decision about the route. * Identification:To help users recognise where they currently are, identification signs can be placed at the entrances of buildings, parks, etc. They symbolise the arrival to a destination. * Regulatory: These let people know what they can and cannot do in a given area and are most frequently phrased negatively with the aim of creating a safe environment. Examples include ‚Äúno smoking‚Äù or ‚Äúrestricted area‚Äù.

It is located in the Ghost Town section of the park, south of the main entrance. It is the tallest and longest wooden coaster on the West Coast of the United States. Ghostrider Entrance History The ride was formerly manufactured by the defunct Custom Coasters International. Construction on the attraction proceeded so quickly that the coaster was completed and opened nearly six months ahead of schedule. In August 1999, an unsecured piece of wood from the track was lifted by a passing train and thrown into another car that was passing below.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1999-aug-26-me-3967-story.html#:~:text=Three%20hours%20after%20the%20mishap,70%20feet%20above%20the%20ground.&text;=That's%20what%20makes%20the%20Knott's,to%20the%20experts%2C%20he%20said. Five people sustained minor injuries and the attraction was temporarily closed for inspection and retrofitting of the track. On August 20, 2015, it was announced that GhostRider would be refurbished and restored for Ghost Town's 75th anniversary. The refurbishment, conducted by Great Coasters International, began on September 8, 2015, and was completed in June 2016.https://www.knotts.com/rides/Roller-Coasters-1-5-12-35/GhostRider The refurbishment saw the replacement and re-profiling of most of the track, the removal of the mid-course brake run and the replacement of the PTC trains with GCI's Millennium Flyer trains. Ride experience =Queue= Riders approach the ride near the entrance to Ghost Town. The queue begins in a mining tunnel and leads into the mine-themed queue house. After a wait in both levels of the queue, riders board one of the three GCI Millennium Flyer trains of the ride. The trains themselves are colored gold, silver, and copper similar to the precious mining metals. The tunnel entrance was once part of the Pan for Gold attraction. As of May 2016, Pan for Gold has returned to its former location and the queue for GhostRider now snakes around it. =Layout= There is a small initial descent into a ravine, which is followed by a gradual sweep to the right. Trains then pass through the transfer track and climb the lift hill. At the top, riders descend a drop, turning left and rising up over an airtime hill before making a sweeping left-hand turnaround. After the turnaround, riders descend another drop, and rise up a gradual right-hand climb, before descending into the structure of the lift hill, and rising up into the ride's midway turnaround. The turnaround starts the second half of the ride. Diving off a straight section which was where midcourse brakes used to be, riders descend a steep drop, making a left-hand turn, rising over an airtime hill, before making a right-hand turnaround underneath the turnaround in the first half. After rising over another airtime hill, the trains enter a 450-degree downward helix to the right, before rising over a final hill and hitting the final brake run. The ride follows an L-shaped double out and back pattern. Most of the attraction resides on the parking lot near the marketplace. The ride crosses over Grand Avenue four times, road connecting southbound Beach Boulevard to the parking lots. The first two in the first half and last two in the second half. The initial drop was covered with a ‚Äúscream shed‚Äù shortly after opening with a metal overhang after nearby residents complained of excessive noise. At night, orange rope lights light up the handrails of the ride. =Trains= Over the sixteen years of GhostRider's operation, the trains have gone through several different design updates. The PTC trains were originally delivered, Copper was a dark brown, Silver was a flat gray, and Gold was a light brown. All trains sported the standard \\"Knott's\\" logo on the front of the train. Later on, ride logos were added and a metallic sheen added onto Gold and Copper trains. Lastly, the third update added airbrush effects on the sides of the individual cars along with a customized \\"Knott's GhostRider\\" logo on the front. Also Copper was repainted to a more metallic orange/copper. Although the ride has three trains, only two are in use at any time. The third train is usually being maintained and will be switched out with one of the other trains during the duration of the year. Each train is gets a maintenance overhaul during the year. After the 2016 refurbishment, the trains were replaced with Great Coasters International's Millennium Flyer trains. As of November 2019, only the Gold and Silver trains are operating, while Copper is under maintenance.

There are large efforts being made to make innovative mobile ICT services work. Examples of these services include mobile tourist guides and shopping guides for consumers. As an emerging trend, technology and service providers combine their expertise and resources to design these services. This incorporates designing several models: the Value network, a Value proposition, a Revenue model and a Technological architecture. Economic value Together contributors need to create a business model that forms the blueprint of the cooperating network of organisations intends to create economic value from technological innovation. Therefore, it is useful to define the different relevant issues: Customer Value of services, Organizational arrangements, Technological architecture, and possible financial arrangements. A business model is: # An architecture for the product, service and information flows, including a description of the various business actors and their roles. # A description of the potential benefits for the various business actors. # A description of the sources of revenues. Collaboration engineering To facilitate the collaboration between the contributors, the methods can be used to act as a guideline for successful innovation during the pre-product phase. Most methods are based on the innovation prototyping method (3), which emphasizes on the balance between different viewpoints. Concepts =Organizational arrangements= The relative large amount of contributing organisations in innovative ICT services has been the cause of important changes that took place in the value chain of these services. Traditionally, one company would perform all necessary activities that make the service work. Nowadays, this is often divided between specialized contributors. This invokes the creation of and ad hoc value net, which replaces the more traditional value chain. In this value web there is less hierarchy and it is more adaptable to changes in roles or contributors. There are also no restrictions on the flow of data between the value net, instead it can flow in all directions all the time. The following definition of a value net can be found in the book \\"Value Nets: Breaking the Supply Chain to unlock hidden profits\\", by David Bovet and Joseph Martha, John Wiley & Sons, Inc, 2000: A value net is a business design that uses digital supply chains to achieve both superior customer satisfaction and company profitability. It is a fast, flexible system that is aligned with and driven by new customer choice mechanisms. A value net is not what the term supply chain conjures up. It is no longer just about supply, but it is also about creating value for customers, the company and its suppliers. The value net differs from the traditional value chain in the sense that it is not a sequential, rigid chain. Instead, it is a dynamic, high performance network of customer/supplier partnerships and information flows. =Customer value of services= The Value Proposition model is used to represent the value of the service from the perspective of the end-user (Customer, Consumer). This model is often surprisingly complex for the design of mobile ICT services. This is because the characteristics are very different from physical products. The SHIP-acronym can be used to define four important characteristics of mobile ICT services (3): # Simultaneously produced and consumed. This mean that the end-user is part of the production of content, and that the producer is also present during the transaction. # Heterogeneous. This means that there is a (almost) unique instance of the service made for each end-user. # Intangible. Although the service is intangible, they are often coupled to physical products. # Perishable. The value of the service disappears after consumption by the end-user. A value proposition model incorporates the consequences of these characteristics into the development process. This model can be in the form of a textual/graphic model, or even a demonstration version of the proposed service. The composition of the Value Proposition forces the designers to think about different important characteristics of mobile ICT services, the FBBM method addresses the following issues in this context 10: # Context in which the service will operate, e.g., in a ‚Äòshopping mall‚Äô, or at the ‚Äòoffice‚Äô. # The proposed target group, e.g., ‚Äòmuseum visitors‚Äô, or ‚Äòtravelling business people‚Äô. # Added value in comparison of existing services, ‚Äòeasier to use‚Äô, or ‚Äògives more information‚Äô. # Estimation of its use, e.g., ‚Äòhow often will consumers use it?‚Äô, and ‚Äòwhat does it mean to the user?‚Äô. The information about service- characteristics that are gathered in this part of the Method is usually sketched in use-cases diagrams. This illustrates the part how the proposed services would interact with the end-user. =Financial arrangements= A Revenue model is used to identify all cash flows concerning the service. These are all costs and revenues that are the result of economic activities. Therefore, the value of each activity must be measured (or approximated) using performance indicators. In the model, the cash flows can be described qualitative at first (high, medium, low) and more in detail at later stages of the development process. The model uses lines representing in- and outgoing cash flows between the value activities and the actors drawn the model. The meta-model consists of the financial arrangements, which describe the costs and the revenues of a service, using performance indicators. =Technological architecture= The Technological Architecture model is used to give an overview of the technical functions, and infrastructure needed to provide the service. For example, the way information is stored, or content is generated and broadcast. Although will be a high-level view of the technological architecture, it can be passed to technical developers who add more detail at a later stage of the development the ICT service. Technique =The meta model= After exploring possible or desired Customer value of services model, Organizational arrangements model, financial arrangements Model and Technological Architecture model, are finalized. This means that they take on their concrete form by actual companies and organizations. This means that the contributing organizations have to fill-in their positions in the value net and decide and negotiate the various design choices for the models. A good mobile business development method should have a metadata model can be similar to the meta models below. The outcome, in the form of a business model can be used to communicate an innovative ICT project outline to investors/participants. It describes the proposed value chain in great detail, because it consists of an overview of the sub models (Customer Value of services, Organisational arrangements, Financial arrangements and Technological architecture) that are balanced. In the total scope of the development of an innovative IT service, a business plan is very helpful in the decision process within the organisations of the participants. =Situational method engineering= Methods can be designed with the use of Situational method engineering. Situational method engineering can be described as the creation of an ad hoc method from fragments (method fragments) from known methods. This enables the creation of development methods to be me suitable for any development situation. In case of mobile business development, there are methods available for specific parts of the business model design process and ICT development. Situational method engineering can be used to combine these methods into one unified method that adopts the characteristics of mobile ICT services. The method fragments frequently used in mobile development are (6): #Quality Function Deployment ‚Äî Quality function deployment (QFD) is a structured methodology that incorporates mathematical tools used to identify and quantify customers' requirements and translates them into key critical parameters. For a complete description of the QFD method, see this page in Wikipedia. #Brainstorm Techniques ‚Äî The FBBM method uses some brainstorm techniques known for a long time in application development. They are used in development sessions. #Financial Analysis ‚Äî The methods incorporated in financial analysis are targeted at calculating the prospects of a firm. By including financial analysis methods in a method, business can calculate important factors like the consumer-price of their services and their Return on Investment (ROI) beforehand. Examples =Shopping mall= Shop owners in all large shopping mall have a plan to enrich the shopping experience in their mall. They want to develop a wireless application to be used on smart phones or on PDAs, which will be made available for rent at the entrance. The application will have an informative and an entertainment component. This way, the shop owners hope that they will create added value for their customers and improve their competitiveness. Because there are many contributors to the development of the application (shop owners, (wireless) network provider, hardware provider), the business model is very complex in this case. The contributors have composed their interpretation of the Value Proposition, the Value Network, the Revenue model and the Technological architecture in a first quick scan. At several more sessions during the pre-product development stage, these work models were compared and balanced. This process then was repeated until all contributors are satisfied with the resulting business model. The end result is a thought through, and working innovative application that is slowly starting to generate more sales for the participants. =Museum= The museum of modern arts has become inspired by other museums to use modern technology to guide its visitors through the museum. It plans to develop a wireless application that runs on museum owned pda's that are lent out to visitors at the entrance. The application uses gps to determine the position of the visitor and streaming video and audio to take on the role as museum guide. The museum board has demanded the creation of a solid business model. The business model will be the basis for future decisions about the project and to explain the project to the museums donators. The museum has found a partner for its project, a wireless Internet provider (WISP) will provide the network and hardware for the application. The WISP can use the museum for promotional activities in return. Together they have composed their interpretation of the Value Proposition, the Value Network, the Revenue model and the Technological architecture in a first quick scan. At several more sessions during the pre- product development stage, these work models were compared and balanced. This process then was repeated until both contributors are satisfied with the resulting business model. The end result is a rich media application that is beneficial to the visitors experience and a clear display of wireless capability for future clients of the WISP.

The film rights were acquired by director Michael Crichton, and the movie was produced by Martin Erlichmann for Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. The cast includes Genevi√®ve Bujold, Michael Douglas, Elizabeth Ashley, Richard Widmark, and Rip Torn. Among the actors in smaller roles are Tom Selleck, Lois Chiles, and Ed Harris. The story was adapted again into a two- part television miniseries broadcast September 2012 on A&E; television network. Plot Dr. Susan Wheeler is a surgical resident at Boston Memorial Hospital. Susan is devastated when a patient, Nancy Greenly, who happens to be her best friend, is pronounced brain-dead and comatose there after a routine suction D & C (Dilation and Curettage) abortion and its concomitant general anesthetic. Her suspicions are aroused when another young and otherwise healthy patient, Sean Murphy, also falls comatose during knee surgery for a recent sports injury. Susan finds that over the previous year an unusual number of other fit, young people have suffered the same fate. She discovers three similarities among the cases: they all took place in the same operating room, all patients were tissue-typed and all the comatose bodies were moved to a remote facility called the Jefferson Institute. She offends Chief of Anesthesiology, Dr. George - a powerful figure in the hospital whose wife is also an heiress - by asking to review the relevant case patient charts. Increasingly isolated and under mounting pressure from superiors and colleagues, she wonders whether she can even trust her own boyfriend, Dr. Mark Bellows. She also visits the morgue where a postmortem examination is being performed on Nancy, who had since died. The pathologists are puzzled, and this leads to speculation on how to commit the perfect murder, to which one of the pathologists suggests carbon monoxide poisoning. Susan is called into the office of Chief of Surgery, Dr. George Harris, owing to her trouble with Dr. George, and is given a weekend off to recuperate from the loss of her friend. She and Mark travel to the seaside and spend a relaxing weekend together. Driving back to Boston they see a sign for the Jefferson Institute. Following an access road, a mysterious, imposing and unmarked concrete building reveals itself. Susan wants both of them to go inside, but Mark declines, allowing her to go alone while he waits in the car. After pressing the buzzer at the entrance, she is greeted by Nurse Emerson. Susan announces herself as Dr. Susan Wheeler, and asks if she can enter, but is informed that the facility is closed, but that the next tour for physicians is Tuesday morning. Returning to join the tour, Susan finds what is apparently an advanced, low-cost care facility for comatose patients. However, while investigating the large areas of the building that were left unvisited, she discovers that the institute is a front for black-market organ sales, where the patients' organs are sold to the highest bidder. Boston Memorial purposely induce comas in select patients whose organs match those of potential buyers. The patients are rendered brain- dead via covert carbon monoxide poisoning through a line that leads from a tank in the basement to one OR--number 8--the valve for which is controlled by a radio signal. While she investigates the Jefferson Institute, Susan is caught on surveillance cameras. She manages to escape security atop the roof of an ambulance leaving to transport harvested organs to Logan Airport. Susan thinks that Dr. George is the mastermind of the scheme, and rushes to her supervisor, Dr. Harris, with whom she has been confiding, and explains what she has discovered. Dr. Harris offers her a drugged drink which begins to incapacitate Susan while also causing severe abdominal pain that mimics appendicitis. As she loses consciousness, Dr. Harris phones in an emergency from his office and offers to perform the appendectomy on Susan himself. As they are preparing for surgery, Dr. Harris is informed that his preferred operating room is not available. His vehement insistence upon using room eight arouses the suspicions of Mark, who finds the gas tank and line to room eight ‚Äì disconnecting it before the carbon monoxide can permanently injure Susan. Susan awakens after surgery, much to Dr. Harris' surprise, and is wheeled out of the operating room holding Mark's hand. A defeated Dr. Harris is left back in operating room eight, while two police officers wait outside to arrest him.

They met when Crichton was doing post-doctoral work in biology at La Jolla's Salk Institute and Cook was a Navy physician stationed at San Diego. Crichton described the film as like a \\"Western... if the doctors are the bad guys they are also the good guys.\\" Crichton says that even though the lead in the book was a female the studio talked about getting Paul Newman to play it, but he fought it. \\"If a man had done the movie, it would be a much more conventional thing.\\" Filming started June 20, 1977. Shooting took place at Boston City Hospital and the University of Southern California's dissection room. The mysterious, Brutalist-style building that served as the film's \\"Jefferson Institute\\" was at the time of filming a regional headquarters of Xerox Corporation located in Lexington, Massachusetts. It currently serves as head office of Stride Rite, an American children's footwear company. Michael Douglas called the film \\"the first time I've been offered a project with a good story laid out well, a good cast, and a good director.\\" The film cost $4.1 million but this was off-set by a pre- sale to TV worth $3 million. Reception Coma was a box-office success, earning $50 million US (about $185 million in 2016 U.S. dollars). It was well received by critics and audiences. The film holds an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 26 reviews.

The hulls of the Avenger-class ships are constructed of wood with an external coat of fiberglass. Guardian was laid down on 8 May 1985 by Peterson Builders, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin; launched on 20 June 1987; and commissioned on 16 December 1989. In 2010, she became the first mine countermeasures vessel in the Seventh Fleet modified for a mixed- sex crew, with separate head facilities. On 17 January 2013, Guardian ran aground on Tubbataha Reef, in a protected area of the Philippines in the middle of the Sulu Sea. The vessel was turned and pushed further onto the reef by wave action. Unable to be recovered, the vessel was decommissioned and struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 15 February 2013. After removal of fuel and useful equipment, and after the upper superstructure was cut and lifted off of the minehunter, the wooden hull was sequentially chainsawed into four sections and lifted off of the reef by the dynamic positioning crane vessel MV Jascon 25.Jascon 25 - DP3 Pipelay Construction vessel, 4 page PDF The bow section was cut and removed by crane on 26 March 2013. It was originally planned to cut the hull into three pieces, but the stern section had to be cut in half again. The last stern section was removed by crane from Tubbataha Reef on 30 March 2013. History In late November 2007, USS Guardian and sister minesweeper sought refueling and refuge from an approaching storm in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour, but were denied entry without explanation by the People's Republic of China. Both ships were eventually refueled at sea and returned safely to their homeports in Japan. In February 2010, USS Guardian became the first mine countermeasures vessel in the Seventh Fleet to receive the Women-at-Sea modification, which was intended to allow the small vessel to accommodate a mixed-sex crew. The modification added no additional sleeping space, but did provide for separate head facilities for female crew members. However, with the exception of a very few officers, all mine countermeasures vessels in the Seventh Fleet were still manned by all-male crews at that time. =January 2013 grounding= USS Guardian was pushed further aground onto Tubbataha Reef by wave action, as shown on 29 January 2013. U.S. Navy-contracted Malaysian tug Vos Apollo removed 15,000 gallons of fuel from Guardian on 24‚Äì25 January 2013, and filled her tanks with seawater. Guardian on 12 March 2013 after superstructure decks were removed, with hull to be salvaged in cut sections by crane vessel MV Jascon 25 A cut-off section of Guardians hull removed from the reef by US Navy-contracted crane vessel MV Jascon 25 on 26 March 2013 On 17 January 2013, following a port call and fuel stop in Subic, Guardian proceeded across the Sulu Sea, and entered the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park. At 2:25 am she ran aground on Tubbataha Reef, about south east of Palawan in the Philippines. About 90 minutes after the grounding, she was seen on park radar at approximately 04:00 hours local time. At the time of the accident, the ship was travelling from Subic Bay in the Philippines to Indonesia. The extent of any damage to the reef was unknown, but there was no evidence of fuel leaks. Philippines officials estimate the damage to the reef at 1,000 square meters. The second night aground the ship shifted and began taking heavy persistent seas to her port side. DC2 Jeff Macatangay and MN3 Pekarcik navigated a tangle of machinery and pipes in the ship's bilge while it filled with water to construct shoring on the keel, greatly slowing flooding and bought the ship four hours of available power and communications. They were awarded the Navy and Marine Corps medal for their actions in the dynamic-hazardous environment. The next day, 18 January 2013, the U.S. Navy evacuated all 79 crew members from the minesweeper to the USNS Bowditch and MV C Champion. In recognition of his actions in evacuating the sailors aboard Guardian, Petty Officer Travis Kirckof, a mineman aboard USS Guardian and one of the two assigned Search and Rescue (SAR) swimmers, was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal on 11 April 2014. Petty Officer Kirckof joined by Petty Officer Nick Martin and Matthew Pekarcik stayed in the shark-infested water for almost five hours to assist his shipmates in the evacuation to the nearby reef, saving at least two lives. On 19 January 2013, an assessment team deployed to plan and execute the vessel's extraction. On 20 January 2013, Navy Times reported the ship was taking on water in multiple places and experiencing a slight list to port. Originally, only the bow section of Guardian rested on the reef, but wave action pushed the entire vessel onto the reef, from the edge. The guided missile destroyer , the oceanographic survey ship and the rescue and salvage ship arrived in the area to help in the intended extraction, as well as tugboats and Philippine navy and coast guard vessels. It was intended for Guardian to be removed from the area by crane ships from Singapore, then be placed on a barge or other ship, since the ship was too damaged to be towed due to multiple hull penetrations. During the time the cranes traveled from Singapore to the Philippines, preparations were made for the lift. 15,000 gallons of fuel were transferred from the tanks in Guardian to other ships, then refilled with seawater to keep the vessel stable. Dry food stores and the personal effects of Guardians crew were removed as well. Salvage workers reinforced the wood-and-fiberglass hull of the minesweeper with Kevlar lines to mitigate stresses from waves hitting the vessel. Then, salvage workers from Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit One and Smit Salvage chopped the superstructure and wooden hull of the ship into chunks. On 29 January 2013, the United States Navy announced the ship would be cut into three sections on the reef prior to removal, resulting in the total loss of the $227 million vessel. USS Guardian was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 February 2013. On 27 February 2013, salvage workers disassemble Guardian, a process estimated to take a month. The bridge deck was removed on 4 March 2013. On 30 March 2013, the stern section of the ship was lifted off the reef, completing the removal process. In February 2013, Guardian was replaced with in the 7th Fleet, with the crew of Warrior returning to San Diego, and the crew of Guardian taking over Warrior. On 8 April 2013, the U.S. Navy turned over digital navigation charts and other evidence and documents and data of Guardian to the Philippine Maritime Casualty Investigating Team (MCIT) and responded to \\"Technical and Substantive\\" queries. The MCIT will conduct an independent investigation and make recommendations about avoid such incidents in the future. On 26 July 2013 it was reported that a chart produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency was inaccurate by up to . This chart was used by the crew of the Guardian, and played a significant role in the grounding. However, significant errors by the crew and commanding officers were also reported, including that they should have noted the inaccuracies in comparison to other charts.http://breakingdefense.com/2013/07/26/untold-tale- behind-uss-guardian-reef-grounding-flawed-nga-map-data/ Original estimates were that of reef was damaged but a survey done after removal, by the World Wide Fund for Nature‚ÄìPhilippines and the Tubbataha Management Office, measured the damage area at . On January 20, 2015, the United States government paid to the Philippine government a total of 87 million Philippine pesos, or US$1.97 million ‚Äì 59 million Philippine pesos for the damage and another 29 million pesos to reimburse services provided by the Philippine Coast Guard. The U.S. federal government apologized for the incident and relieved four officers: LCDR Mark Rice, Commanding Officer; LT Daniel Tyler, Executive Officer; the Lieutenant (j.g.) who was Officer of the Deck; and a QMC who was Assistant Navigator and Quartermaster of the Watch at the time of the mishap. \\"The initial investigation findings clearly indicate that (the four) at the time of the grounding did not adhere to standard US Navy navigation procedures,\\" the Manila Bulletin quoted the U.S. Navy as saying. The U.S. government has acknowledged that the grounding was entirely preventable and caused by human error and a failure of leadership to provide adequate oversight and direction in planning and executing the Navigation Plan. = Chart error = The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) admitted that the coastal scale Digital Nautical Chart (DNC) supplied to USS Guardian was flawed due to human error on the part of the NGA. This mislocated the Tubbataha Reef by east- southeast of its location. NGA was aware of this error in 2011, and modified a smaller scale electronic chart. NGA failed to publish a correction for the larger scale chart the USS Guardian was using before the navigation officer ran the ship aground. However, the Navy continues to conceal their reasons for USS Guardian transiting these restricted waters in the first place.

It is down the line from . It is on the Alton Line, part of the National Rail network, with train services and station facilities provided by South Western Railway. It has the three-letter code AHT. The station's National Location Code (NLC) is 5623. History The London and South Western Railway opened the station in 1870. It became part of the Southern Railway in the 1923 Grouping. The station then passed to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. Network SouthEast operated and served the station after British Rail Sectorised itself in 1982. South West Trains has operated and served the station since the Privatisation of British Railways in 1996. Services Train destinations are normally , , , and . Trains are usually routed to via with three services in the morning peak scheduled to go the longer slower route via (included as part of the normal Aldershot to service) and two returning via this route in the evening.GB eNRT 2015-16 Edition, Tables 149 & 155 The typical off-peak service (Monday to Saturday) from the station is: * 2 trains per hour to London Waterloo, * 2 trains per hour to Alton, * 2 trains per hour to Guildford, * 2 trains per hour to Ascot (Berkshire) *2 trains per hour to Farnham. Ticket machines ticket vending machine. There are 2 new TicketXpress ticket vending machines which now reside outside the entrance to the booking hall, making them accessible when the station booking hall is closed. They are available at all times, except when remotely disabled when there is no service, such as at Christmas. These new machines sell tickets to many stations in Great Britain and accept major credit and debit cards. The QuickFare self-service ticket machine (removed October 2006) accepted coins and banknotes and issued tickets to a variety of local destinations, as well as issuing tickets for the station car park. Discounts were available for holders of most Railcards. QuickFare ticket machines were used by British Rail and the Train Companies for many years, providing easy access to tickets at unstaffed stations and at times when ticket offices were closed. The QuickFare ticket machine at Aldershot station was inside the booking hall on platform one. The place where it once stood is now occupied by the \\"scu\\" (the control centre that operates the new gateline). Rolling stock Services are mainly run using a four, eight or twelve car Class 450 and 2 cycles can be carried per train. Class 444 Desiro five-car units are seen from time to time. Up to 2005, ex-British Rail slam-door EMUs were used on the Alton Line, many of which were berthed at the carriage sidings south of Farnham station. The carriage shed at Farnham was built in 1937 around the time that the line was electrified. The most commonly operated EMUs in recent years were Class 411, Class 421 and Class 423 units. These trains were withdrawn in 2005, except for a very few that were transferred to the Lymington Branch. Platforms Aldershot railway station, showing (from left to right) platforms 3, 2 and 1 The station has three platforms. The station entrance and ticket office is by Platform 1. Tracks by Platforms 2 and 3 are signalled for bi-directional operation. Platforms 2 and 3 are reached by way of the original subway and a more recent covered footbridge. Lifts are incorporated into the footbridge for disabled access. Local Features As trains approach Farnham to the south, the mileage suddenly jumps to a higher one. This is because mileages between the site of Farnham Junction (by the electric substation just before the A31 flyover bridge) and (the end of the line that formerly continued to Winchester) are reckoned from via and the now closed line via and . The line from Waterloo via and Aldershot was built significantly later than that via and .

May played Premier League football for Blackburn Rovers and Manchester United where he collected numerous trophies in a nine-year spell at Old Trafford. He went on to play in the Football League for Huddersfield Town and Burnley before finishing his career with non-League club Bacup Borough.

Phil Jones is a perfect player for Manchester United Manchester Evening News, 15 June 2011 as he was apparently unhappy at Blackburn in his final months due to the breakdown in contract negotiations. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson had been searching for a defender to add to the squad, and specifically needed an Englishman who would not be affected by the restrictions on foreign players in European competition that were in place at the time. He was also thinking about the future, as centre-back and captain Steve Bruce was in his 34th year and Gary Pallister was approaching 30.May's days When Saturday Comes, October 2003 Injuries to first-choice right-back Paul Parker meant that May was often used as a right-back in his first season, and rarely played in his preferred centre-back position due to the strong partnership of Bruce and Pallister. As May underperformed, by the end of the season, Gary Neville had emerged to become the new first-choice right-back, while Parker was rarely used the following season and then left the club. Manchester United finished the season in second place in the Premier League, losing out to May's old club Blackburn Rovers. May finally managed to establish himself in the team towards the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season as an understudy for Bruce, who was struggling with a hamstring injury, and scored the first goal in the final match of the season against Middlesbrough. The 3‚Äì0 victory clinched the title for Manchester United. He was also in the starting line-up for the 1996 FA Cup Final victory over Liverpool, while Bruce was not even selected as a substitute.FA Cup flashback BBC Sport, 16 February 2006 Bruce departed to Birmingham City soon after, and May became a regular starter in the 1996‚Äì97 season, making over 40 appearances and often being paired with Gary Pallister, although a third centre-back, new signing Ronny Johnsen, had been signed in the summer of 1996 and was a regular in the first team. His contributions were important as United retained the league title and also reached the semi-final of the Champions League after a 4‚Äì0 victory over Porto in the quarter-final, in which May scored the first goal. His form meant that he received a late call-up to the England national team for a friendly against Mexico, but he never actually won an international cap. The purchases of Henning Berg and Jaap Stam as well as the emergence of Wes Brown limited his chances further during the late 1990s and he saw very little action with the first team. However, towards the end of the treble-winning 1998‚Äì99 season, May enjoyed a brief comeback as Ferguson rotated his squad to cope with the mounting fixture congestion and United were challenging for the league title, FA Cup and European Cup. He was also named in the starting line-up for the 1999 FA Cup FinalFA Cup 1999 Manchester United F.C., 6 November 2011 as Stam was being rested for the Champions League Final against Bayern Munich.

In his first appearance for the Terriers, however, he picked up an injury and had to return for treatment to Old Trafford, where he remained for another three years, but often sidelined by injury and playing mainly in the reserve team. May's last four seasons with United saw him make only 12 appearances in total for the club. Due to his lack of appearances, May collected only two Premier League winner's medals, despite being a squad member for six winning campaigns.

Metro do Porto S.A. was founded in 1993, and the first line of the system opened in 2002.Webb, Mary (ed.) (2009). Jane's Urban Transport Systems 2009‚Äì2010, p. 277. Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): Jane's Information Group. . The network has 6 lines and reaches seven municipalities within the metropolitan Porto area: Porto, Gondomar, Maia, Matosinhos, P√≥voa de Varzim, Vila do Conde and Vila Nova de Gaia. It currently has a total of 82 operational stations across of double track commercial line. Most of the system is at ground level or elevated, but of the network is underground. The system is run by ViaPORTO. History Porto Metro train. Line A (blue line) between Senhor de Matosinhos and Trindade in central Porto was the first Porto Metro line to open, in 2002. The line was extended in 2004 to Est√°dio do Drag√£o, in time for the Euro 2004 Football championship. On April 14, 2005, Line B (red line) opened. The Casa da M√∫sica concert hall (which has a station on the combined ABCEF line) opened on the same day. Lines A and B are the last legacy of a line which once went from Trindade to Famalic√£o, originally narrow gauge, opened in 1875, completed in 1881 and switched to metre gauge in 1930. (The stretch from Varzim to Famalic√£o is now a bicycle trail.) Line C (green line) opened on July 30, 2005, reaching the centre of Maia. An extension to ISMAI opened in March 2006. Line C uses a stretch formerly part of the Guimar√£es line which joined the current line at Lousado. Line D (yellow line) proved the most problematic to excavate and opened in 2005. The line runs from Jo√£o de Deus and Vila Nova de Gaia in the south before crossing the River Douro and passing through central Porto en route to S√£o Jo√£o Hospital in the north. The S√£o Jo√£o Hospital and IPO stations were not brought into service until April 2006 due to safety concerns. In October 2011, it was extended to Santo Ov√≠dio. Line E (violet line) opened on May 27, 2006, connecting the Airport Francisco S√° Carneiro and Campanh√£. Several weeks later, the line was extended until Est√°dio do Drag√£o. An end-to-end journey takes 33 minutes, with trains departing every 20 minutes. Line F (orange line) opened on January 2, 2011, connecting the Porto city centre to the Gondomar region in the east, this line runs between Senhora da Hora and F√¢nzeres. Lines A, B, C, E & F follow the same course within the City of Porto (between Est√°dio do Drag√£o and Senhora da Hora). The transfer point between Line ABCEF and Line D is at Trindade in central Porto; from Trindade to Senhora da Hora, the right of way recycles the original Porto- Varzim-Famalic√£o/Maia-Trofa-Guimar√£es trunk line.  Costs and financial results  On board a Porto Metro train An Andante ticket being validated As of 2007, the total cost of Porto Metro mass transit public transport system stands on 3,500 million euros - over 1% of Portugal's GDP. The first phase of the project alone, which was led by the mayors of several Grande Porto (Greater Porto) municipalities including Valentim Loureiro as a chairman of the state-owned company, was 140% more expensive than initially planned which means a slippage of over 1,500 million euros. The Porto Metro state-owned company has reported losses every year, reaching a record loss of 122 million euros in 2006.Gestores do Metro do Porto recebem ‚Ç¨650 mil de pr√©mios, Expresso newspaper, 18 February 2006, accessed March 2007 (in Portuguese)Metro do Porto fechou exerc√≠cio com resultado negativo de 122 milh√µes de euros , Di√°rio Econ√≥mico website, 7 March 2007, accessed March 2007 (in Portuguese)  Trains  The Metro uses modern Eurotram low-floor, articulated trams. New Flexity Swift LRVs are used on line B, Bx and occasionally line C since 2008, and can reach 100 km/h (62.5 mph). They also have more seats, and can, in common with most modern light rail systems, recover 30% of the total of consumed energy during braking. The majority of services run with two LRVs coupled together. The Eurotram consists of four main compartments, two in each carriage linked by short corridors, and also features an articulation between the two carriages. They have a capacity of 80 seated and 134 standing passengers. Tickets The system uses the \\"Andante\\" ticketing system. Machines in stations issue and can recharge Andante Azul - blue \\"Occasional\\" tickets, while Andante Gold is a credit-card style \\"Gold\\" tickets (which bear a scanned photograph of the holder) that can be purchased in Lojas Andante (Andante Shops). Tickets can also be topped up at Multibanco ATM terminals. The Porto Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system. Tickets must be validated before travel by scanning them in front of the yellow machines located in stations. A validated occasional ticket allows for unlimited travel within a specified time period, currently 1 hour for the minimum 2-zone ticket, and longer as the number of valid zones increases. The gold passes allow unlimited travel within a pre-defined area, and are available in \\"anytime\\" or cheaper \\"10/16\\" (off- peak) versions. There is also a daily ticket, known as Andante 24 that allows the user to make unlimited trips within a given day in the zones chosen. For example, a Z3 (3-zone) ticket is valid for 3 zones in any direction of travel from the first validated zone. So, to cover all of the Metro, except the northernmost part of Line B (zones VCD3 and PV_VC), a Z4 ticket is needed, provided it is validated in zone PRT1. There are no faregates within the Metro; instead, groups of fare inspectors randomly check tickets with hand- held scanners. The current penalty for travelling without a validated ticket is ‚Ç¨120. The metro uses the same zoning system as the majority of public transport providers in the Porto metropolitan area, which is divided by counties, and further divided into numbered sub-zones (for example, VCD3 is the third area of the Vila do Conde county). The PRT1 zone in central Porto is effectively the area contained within the VCI (Via Cintura Interna) inner ring-road, while zones PRT2 and PRT3 are the areas between the VCI and the Estrada da Circunvala√ß√£o outer ring-road. The Andante system is being rolled out across the entire Porto public transit network. STCP bus routes and some other bus routes currently accept Andante and the intention is for the entire bus, metro and suburban train network to become integrated. The same ticket cannot be used on downtown Porto trams and the cable car (Funicular dos Guindais). The Andante Azul that tourists typically use are not valid, though the Andante Gold loaded with monthly tickets may be accepted. Network { class=wikitable - !colspan=6 - !colspan=2 Line ! Length !

It has 23 stations. The line was opened between Trindade and Senhor de Matosinhos on 7 December 2002, by then Prime Minister Barroso. Until the end of 2002 travel was free of charge to allow users to familiarize themselves with the new light rail line. On June 5, 2004, on the occasion of the Euro 2004 European Football Championship, the section between Trindade and Est√°dio do Drag√£o was opened. Trains run every 10 minutes between 07:00 and 20:00 between Senhor de Matosinhos and Est√°dio do Drag√£o, with some trips extended to F√¢nzeres on Line F. Between 6:00 and 7:00 and after 20:00 the frequency is 15 minutes. After 21:00 trains only run between Senhor de Matosinhos and Trindade.

The line reuses, for almost its entire length, the route of the old P√≥voa Line, which connected Trindade to P√≥voa de Varzim. Line B was Porto Metro's second line to open. Initially the line only ran between Est√°dio do Drag√£o and Senhora da Hora, thus sharing the route with Line A. On March 13, 2005, an extension was opened between Senhora da Hora and Pedras Rubras. On March 18, 2006, after successive delays, the final section to P√≥voa de Varzim was officially inaugurated. The line has two types of services between P√≥voa de Varzim and Est√°dio do Drag√£o: regular, which stops at all stations; and the Bx express, which only stops only at Portas Fronhas, Vila do Conde, Varziela, Mindelo and Pedras Rubras, between P√≥voa de Varzim and Senhora da Hora. From early summer 2011 the express service was expanded to operate daily. In July 2016, Porto Metro announced that an additional infill station, Modivas Norte, will be added at The Style Outlet. The work is financed 50% by the mall management and will cost a total of ‚Ç¨1.2 million. Although no extensions are planned, consideration was given to use the abandoned Famalic√£o branch to reach Barreiros, near Avenida 25 de Abril, via Mour√µes. Beyond P√≥voa de Varzim the right-of-way has been converted into a cycle path in order to preserve the branch. = Line C = ;ISMAI ‚Äì Campanh√£ *Travel time: 41 minutes *Headway: 15 minutes File:Maia 4 (Portugal).jpgLine C near the Forum Maia station File:Oporto - Metro Aliados - 20110424 160847.jpgAliados station entrance = Line D = ;Santo Ov√≠dio ‚Äì Hospital S√£o Jo√£o :Travel time: 25 minutes :Minimum headway: 5 / 10 minutes File:Porto - Metro.jpgTrain crossing Dom Lu√≠s I Bridge File:Esta√ß√£o trindade Metro do Porto.jpgLine D platform at Trindade Station File:Ipostation.jpgIPO Station = Line E = ;Aeroporto ‚Äì Trindade :Travel time: 35 minutes :Headway: 30 minutes = Line F = ;Senhora da Hora ‚Äì F√¢nzeres :Travel time: 39 minutes :Headway: 15 minutes  Funicular dos Guindais  thumb Car of the funicular.

Life He was born in a tenement at 140 McDonald RoadEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1912 off Leith Walk in northern Edinburgh on 13 April 1913 the son of Rachel Swan and Magnus Donaldson. He was of Shetland descent. Donaldson attended Broughton Elementary School (adjacent to his home) and then the Royal High School of Edinburgh (1921‚Äì31), before being awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Edinburgh. He also supplemented his income by undertaking some tutoring. After graduating in 1935 with a first- class Honours Degree in History (MA), he gained his PhD in 1938 at the Institute of Historical Research in London, where he also won the David Berry Prize from the Royal Historical Society. Donaldson also has a DLitt degree. After working as an archivist at the General Register Office for Scotland 1938-1947, he was appointed to a lectureship in Scottish History at the University of Edinburgh, largely through the offices of William Croft Dickinson. This marked the beginning of Donaldson's 32-year academic career at the University. He served as a Reader from 1955, before succeeding Dickinson as Professor of Scottish History and Palaeography in 1963, which he held until his retirement in 1979. During his academic career, Professor Donaldson wrote or co-wrote over thirty books, and numerous articles and addresses. He also served at various times as President of the Scottish Ecclesiological Society, the Scottish Church History Society, the Scottish History Society, the Scottish Record Society, the Scottish Records Association, and the Stair Society. In 1978 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Norman Gash, Geoffrey Barrow, Sir Fraser Noble, and John Cameron, Lord Cameron. He was also an Honorary Vice-President of the Royal Historical Society, and in 1992 he received the St Olav's Medal from the King of Norway. When Professor Donaldson retired, he was appointed Historiographer Royal in Scotland. He could talk about any character in Scottish history as if he knew them personally. It was his love of the sea and ships, born from his childhood in Shetland, that took him to Dysart in Fife in his retirement, where he lived in a 17th-century Pan Ha' apartment. \\"I cannot pass my old age without the sight of the sea and ships,\\" he said. He died in Windygates in Fife on 16 March 1993. He never married and left no family.

The group was formed in 1982 by Aaron Cometbus, founder of the seminal punk rock zine Cometbus, and future Operation Ivy vocalist Jesse Michaels. They grew out of the East Bay scene, centered on 924 Gilman Street, and had an important influence on later East Bay bands such as Operation Ivy, Green Day and punk rock in general. History =Establishment (1982-1986)= Crimpshrine originally formed in 1982 under the name S.A.G. with Aaron Cometbus playing guitar and Jesse Michaels (later of Operation Ivy) on vocals, both 13 years old.Sleep, What's That? liner notes. Retrieved 2014-08-23 They quickly added friend Jeff Ott, then 12, on drums initially but switched to guitar soon after and Cometbus took over drums. Regarding Ott's guitar skills, Michaels described him as \\"twenty times better than us\\", as he initially tried to play guitar but \\"didn't know any chords, so I played with my thumb.\\" According to Elliot, the band had a \\"serious lack of equipment\\", as they had one drum and only 3 strings on the guitar. Michaels was kicked out of the band in 1984, which he said was for \\"smoking too much pot\\", and Ott and Cometbus changed the band's name to Crimpshrine. According to Ott, the name came from a nickname for a girl they knew who had \\"bleached-blond, burned, crimped hair.\\" The group initially wanted a female singer, but couldn't find one so Ott took over on vocals in late 1984 and they then went through various different line-ups during 1985. Ott began experimenting with playing synthesizer and piano, a man named Isaac joined on violin and Tim Armstrong (then known as Lint) played bass for a brief period. Pete Rypins joined as the group's bassist in October 1986 and, according to Cometbus, they \\"started to get out of Jeff's basement and play some parties and shows.\\" =Active years (1987-1989)= After Rypins joined, they played shows sporadically during its early years, with vocalist Ott living on the streets of Berkeley for a time.\\"Crimpshrine,\\" Maximum Rocknroll, whole no. 63 (Aug. 1988). In February 1987, the group recorded their first demo tape, which received enough circulation that Maximumrocknroll asked the band to record songs for the magazine's upcoming compilation Turn It Around!, to which the band agreed and recorded \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Rearranged\\" in August. Shortly after, they went to Dangerous Rhythm in Oakland, California to record songs for their debut EP with producer/engineer Kevin Army. David Hayes, co-founder of Lookout Records, was impressed with the band and offered to release the tracks recorded at Dangerous Rhythm. The group agreed and their debut EP Sleep, What's That? was released in January 1988. Idon Bryant, a friend of the band's, joined on second guitar soon after and they went to Dancing Dog Studios in Emeryville, California to record their debut album in April.Lame Gig Contest liner notes. Retrieved 2014-08-23 Although the recordings were turned down by Lookout, the band added tracks from previous sessions and released Lame Gig Contest in Germany on the label Musical Tragedies. Crimpshrine then embarked on their only United States tour in September 1988. The tour was a contentious one, with Idon Bryant and Pete Rypins abruptly leaving the band in Gainesville, Florida and heading home.Al Kowalewski, \\"Crimpshrine,\\" Flipside, whole no. 57 (Fall 1988), pp. 59-60. Stuck in Florida without a bassist, friends Ben Weasel and John Jughead of Screeching Weasel drove out from Chicago to help them out and the former played bass with the band for two shows. A bit later when Screeching Weasel was without a drummer, Cometbus played drums with them for two shows around Chicago. Paul Curran was then courted to join Crimpshrine on bass, so he and his brother Jack drove out in a Ford Pinto and finished the tour with the band.Quit Talkin' Claude... liner notes. Retrieved 2014-08-24 After the tour in January 1989, they went to Dancing Dog Studios again and recorded what would end up being their final release, the Quit Talkin' Claude... EP. =Break-up and legacy= The group broke up in May 1989 shortly after the release of the Quit Talkin' Claude... EP. Cometbus went on to perform in Pinhead Gunpowder among many other bands, Ott went on to front Fifteen, Curran joined Monsula and Rypins became the bassist for Tilt and later The Tantrums. In recent years, the band has been regarded as influential by many of their peers, including Operation Ivy, Green Day, Jawbreaker, among others. A tribute album to both Crimpshrine and Fifteen, called Can You Spare a Dime?, was released in 1998 by Microcosm Publishing. Crimpshrine is featured in the 2017 documentary Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk. Although closely associated with the Gilman Street Project, Cometbus was quick to note in a 1988 interview with Flipside magazine that they were not a direct product of Gilman, having been established as a band years before the launch of the club. \\"We helped them as much as they helped us because we are a part of it just as much,\\" Cometbus said.

He climbed with Joe Brown and Chris Bonington on many new routes, and was considered the technical equal of both. Early life Born and brought up in a two-up two-down house in Salford, Lancashire, Whillans began hiking on the Pennine moors while still at Broughton modern school; climbing was the next step for an adventurous young boy. Career Whillans was an apprentice plumber when he started his climbing career with Joe Brown in 1951. Whillans met Brown while climbing at the Roaches in Staffordshire. When Brown's climbing partner failed to follow him up a new route, Whillans asked if he could try‚Äîand subsequently led the second pitch of Brown's new route, which became known as \\"Matinee\\". From rock climbing he expanded into mountaineering with trips to the Alps where ascents included the \\"Bonatti Pillar\\" of the Dru and the first ascent with Chris Bonington, Jan D≈Çugosz and Ian Clough of the Central Pillar of Freney on Mont Blanc. In 1962 with Bonington he made the first ascent of the Central Torres del Paine, Patagonia and with Dougal Haston, he made the first ascent of the south face of Annapurna in Bonington's 1970 expedition. Whillans was attributed with safety and mountain awareness, as evidenced by his retreat from the Eiger North Face on several occasions because of bad weather or rockfall. He had few climbing accidents although there were several near misses, such as when a fixed rope on the Central Torres del Paine snapped and he managed to put his weight on the holds with split-second timing before retying the rope. =Personality= Whillans was well regarded for his capacity to deliver a cracking one-liner off the cuff. One example which encapsulates his wry humour concerns him encountering a team of‚Äîto his mind‚Äîpoorly equipped Japanese mountaineers attempting the north face of the Eiger. \\"You going up?\\" Whillans asked them. \\"Yes! Yes!\\" came the reply. Pause, then Whillans: \\"You may be going a lot higher than you think.\\" Whillans participated in the 1971 International Expedition and 1972 European Everest Expedition, each attempting to climb Mount Everest's southwest face. The latter expedition was plagued with personality conflicts and the withdrawal of many climbers. While in camp, some other climbers overheard news that England had lost a football match to Germany. \\"It seems we have beaten you at your national sport\\", said a German. After a pause Whillans replied, \\"Aye, and we've beaten you at yours...twice.\\" Another incident occurred one night in an alpine hut when two climbers were engaged in a whispered conversation disturbing the sleep of other climbers, one of whom was Whillans. Eventually he demanded that they shut up; there was a brief pause before one of the youths aggressively refused to be quiet, remarking into the darkness \\"Who do you think you are?\\" The gruff reply of \\"Whillans\\" was followed by complete silence. However, Whillans's biographer Jim Perrin suggests many of these stories are myths. Whillans liked to emphasise his working class credentials, and on lecture tours, enjoyed telling the story of being stormbound in a tent high in the Himalayas with Dougal Haston who had finished reading The Lord of the Rings and passed him the book. Whillans read a few pages and remarked: \\"I'm not reading that crap, it's full of fooking fairies\\"! Whillans was a heavy drinker, which harmed his career after the expedition to Annapurna and may have contributed to his early death. Although he was only 5' 4\\" tall, he had a reputation as a brawler and stories of his prowess circulated. He designed mountaineering equipment, including the \\"Whillans Harness\\", once described as designed to safely transport beer-guts to great height, and the \\"Whillans-box\\" expedition tent. Death He died at the age of 52 of a heart attack and was the subject of a biography titled The Villain by the author‚Äìclimber Jim Perrin in 2005. Legacy The British Mountaineering Council maintain a climbing hut near the Roaches in memory of Whillans.

Large, brainy, and athletic, she has an assertive personality and a forceful voice. She plays every kind of sport, and Bertie suspects she may have boxed for her university.Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 100.

He partnered with George Grant Elmslie, and briefly with George Feick. The firm of Purcell & Elmslie produced designs for buildings in twenty-two states, Australia, and China. The firm had offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Portland, Oregon. Early life and education Purcell was born in Wilmette, Illinois on July 2, 1880. His parents, Charles A. and Anna Cora Purcell lived first with William Cunningham and Catherine Garns Gray, Anna's parents, in Oak Park, Illinois. Although the Purcells eventually moved into their own home, except for brief periods the young boy remained with his grandparents over the next five years. In 1886, William Gray Purcell began living permanently with them at his own request. His father was an important grain trader, and his grandfather was editor of The Interior, and a writer of national repute. For many summers, W. C. Gray had taken fishing vacations on the peninsula of upper Michigan. In 1885, however, he was saddened to realize the extent to which the environment had been despoiled by destructive logging and mining practices. In 1886 Gray arranged the purchase of three square miles of land surrounding an island on a lake in northern Wisconsin, in co-ownership with the recently widowed Nettie Fowler McCormick, also of Chicago. Every following summer from 1887 until his death in 1901, Gray brought his family, friends, and associates to Island Lake Camp, as the isolated forest enclave came to be called. During this time Purcell became skilled as a photographer, his hobby made possible by the newly available commercial outfits which supplied camera, photographic plates, processing chemicals and printing papers in one package. Purcell received his first camera from W. C. Gray in 1888, a Kodak model given to The Interior office just before public release of the product. When Purcell was fifteen, Frank Lloyd Wright built his Oak Park studio on the same block where Charles A. Purcell lived, not far from the Grays. In Chicago, where Purcell went frequently to visit his grandfather at The Interior offices, the work of Louis Sullivan continued to impress the young architect-to-be. His mind was already made up to pursue the study of the building arts in college and, following his graduation from Oak Park High School in 1899, he entered the School of Architecture at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. Career After graduation from Cornell in 1903, Purcell returned to Oak Park, Illinois. Purcell considered applying to Frank Lloyd Wright for a position in his architectural practice. Instead, Purcell took a clerking position with Ezra E. Roberts, a stable and prosperous architect of whom Charles A. Purcell thought well. During a dinner party in Oak Park, Purcell met George Grant Elmslie, then the chief draftsman for Louis Sullivan. The two men liked one another immediately, not least because of their shared interest in progressive architecture. When Purcell complained of his situation with Roberts, Elmslie offered to secure Purcell a position in the Sullivan office. However, there was not a great deal of work to be done in the office. Purcell spent five months there, from August to December 1903. In 1904, Purcell ventured to the West Coast by way of an extended journey through the southwestern United States. He eventually arrived at Los Angeles and applied for work at the office of Myron Hunt, but there was no opening. On the recommendation of those with whom he interviewed, Purcell left southern California for San Francisco. Hired by John Galen Howard, Purcell became clerk of the works for the construction of California Hall, being built on the University of California campus at Berkeley. In 1905 Purcell moved farther up the coast to Seattle, Washington, where he worked for several months in the office of A. Warren Gould. Purcell's father, who was afraid of the effects of the region's weather on the health of his son, offered to send him on a year- long tour of Europe. Accepting the offer, Purcell contacted his former classmate, George Feick, Jr., and two men agreed to meet in New York. In April, 1906 Purcell and Feick were greeted upon their landing at Naples, Italy, by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. After visiting Florence and Venice, they traveled across Greece to Constantinople and by June had returned to western Europe. Purcell was keen to seek out the best contemporary design and, remembering a suggestion made by Elmslie he stopped in Holland to visit the architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage. Berlage received him warmly and the two established a long-lasting friendship. Purcell was also successful in his efforts to reach Scandinavia, where he met progressive architects Ferdinand Boberg and M. Nyrop. These contacts added to his growing desire to commence his own work and shortly after returning to the United States, Purcell moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to open an office in partnership with George Feick, Jr. The architectural practice most widely known as Purcell & Elmslie consisted of three partnerships. The first, Purcell & Feick, was formed in 1907. George Elmslie was an informal influence in the work of Purcell & Feick. During the last months of 1909 Louis Sullivan could no longer pay George Elmslie because of declining business fortunes, and Elmslie was forced to find a more reliable situation. By 1910 Elmslie had left the Sullivan office and moved to Minneapolis as a full partner in Purcell, Feick & Elmslie. George Elmslie brought important business contacts that resulted in a growing number of commissions from former Sullivan clients. George Feick followed leads for projects in his hometown and handled small buildings for friends and acquaintances. Purcell continued to develop productive friendships with men who lived in small towns throughout the Midwest, which created a network of sympathizers who kept the firm advised of potential jobs. Over the course of the partnership, Purcell & Elmslie became one of the most commissioned firms among the Prairie School architects, second only to Frank Lloyd Wright. During these years of success, personal events brought substantial changes to the lives of both Purcell and Elmslie. Profoundly affected by the death of his wife in 1912, Elmslie left Minneapolis in March 1913 and returned to Chicago where he opened a second Purcell, Feick & Elmslie office. George Feick did not completely share the intense dedication of Purcell and Elmslie to the new architecture, and in 1913 left Minneapolis to rejoin his father's business in Sandusky, Ohio. After the Woodbury County Courthouse was completed in 1918, the business of the firm entered a decline. Purcell requested the dissolution of the Purcell & Elmslie partnership in 1921. Purcell moved to Portland, Oregon in November 1919 to join his cousin, Charles H. Purcell, in a bridge building company called the Pacific States Engineering Corporation (PSEC). After the dissolution of the firm of Purcell & Elmslie, Purcell marketed standardized plans through a variety of service firm names. The Pacific States Engineering Corporation (PSEC) houses were a mainstay of Purcell's architectural practice during the 1920s. Purcell also became involved with the Architect's Small House Service Bureau (ASHSB,) and associated himself with other area architects in numerous residential designs in and around the Portland area. He also became increasingly active in professional, civic, and arts organizations. In 1925 Purcell met James Van Evera Bailey, a young architect who was an integral participant in both the design and construction process for four houses built during the Portland years. The largest and final major commission that Purcell received was the Third Church of Christ Scientist, in Portland, completed in 1926. Throughout the decade, Purcell had felt a progressive decline in his physical well being and, finally seeking medical attention in 1930, was diagnosed as having advanced tuberculosis. He closed his architectural practice and moved to a sanatorium in Banning, California. Following successful lung surgery, Purcell retired to an estate in the foothills of Southern California, near Pasadena. He continued to develop and support the cause of American architecture for another thirty years, mostly through publishing many essays, consulting with architectural historians, and other writings. Purcell turned to writing and began an articulation of his views on art and architecture that continued prolifically until his death. Two projects were of special importance to him. From the late 1930s to the mid 1950s, he developed a series of unpublished essays called \\"The Parabiographies\\" that were commission-by-commission accounts of experiences during his architectural practice. These pages, together with many manuscripts discussing Sullivan and the \\"function and form\\" thesis, were sent for reading to George Elmslie who often added his own annotations. From 1940 to 1955, Purcell was principal contributing editor to an architectural journal, Northwest Architect, to which he contributed more than sixty articles. During 1962-1963, Purcell had an architectural apprentice who would go on to become a significant American organic architect, Arthur Dyson. Dyson spent nearly a year in the Taliesin Fellowship prior to the death of Frank Lloyd Wright in 1959, before going to work for notable organic architect Bruce Goff, who gave Dyson a copy of a catalog from an exhibition about Purcell and Elmslie that took place in Minneapolis. Dyson sought out Purcell as a mentor. The two men spent their time together reviewing the records of Purcell and Elmslie and discussing the nature of architectural design. After his death on April 11, 1965, he was buried in the Forest Home Cemetery, Forest Park, Illinois.Prairie Styles Works Purcell's second house, originally named \\"Lake Place\\" There are two houses built by William Gray Purcell for his personal residence in Minneapolis. The second was built in 1913 and called \\"Lake Place\\" by the Purcell family. Known now as the Edna S. Purcell House, the house is maintained by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. His \\"Maryhill\\" in Edina, Minnesota, is interesting because of the documentation of how it was created. It was designed by Purcell in correspondence with the future owners, Paul and Mary Carson, and the 600 pieces of their correspondence are in the University of Minnesota's Architectural Archives. Not all of Purcell's work fits in the \\"Prairie School\\" category. Several of his houses in Portland's West Hills show how he adapted his ideas to fit a more urban setting. A feature shared by one of those houses and Maryhill is a sleeping loft, but the Portland example also features a wooden carving of Nils on his goose flying out over the living room. In the 1920s, Purcell moved to the Pacific Northwest where he designed a number of \\"cotswald\\" style homes. In 1922, Purcell designed the Louis and Elizabeth Woerner House in the Alameda District of Portland's Eastside. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2004. Hayes, Matthew J. - Nomination Form, Louis and Elizabeth Woerner House, Portland Oregon. Retrieved June 30, 2013. In the 1930s Purcell moved to Pasadena, California. In Pasadena, Purcell first built Moderne work. His only known surviving Moderne building is his own vacation home in Palm Springs. Purcell after WW2 seems to have fully embraced modernism and some five homes designed by him from 1945-1965 survive in Pasadena in various levels of modification. The William Gary Purcell papers were donated by the estate to the Northwest Architectural Archives 1965. The collection contains drawings, including plans, elevations and sections, for much of the firm's work, together with renderings, sketches, photographs and correspondence. Letters, photographs and books from Purcell's maternal grandfather (William Cunningham Gray, 1830-1901) form part of the collection. Also present in the papers are manuscripts, typescripts, and clippings. Achievements and publications Purcell was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1963. Purcell is the author of the 1967 book, St. Croix Trail Country: Recollections of Wisconsin, a memoir of his youth spent in the Wisconsin lake country.

For example, the implementation of bureaucracies in government is a kind of rationalization, as is the construction of high-efficiency living spaces in architecture and urban planning. A potential reason as to why rationalization of a culture may take place in the modern era is the process of globalization. Countries are becoming increasingly interlinked, and with the rise of technology, it is easier for countries to influence each other through social networking, the media and politics. An example of rationalization in place would be the case of witch doctors in certain parts of Africa. Whilst many locals view them as an important part of their culture and traditions, development initiatives and aid workers have tried to rationalize the practice in order to educate the local people in modern medicine and practice (Giddens, 2013). Many sociologists, critical theorists and contemporary philosophers have argued that rationalization, falsely assumed as progress, has had a negative and dehumanizing effect on society, moving modernity away from the central tenets of Enlightenment.Habermas, J√ºrgen, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity, Polity Press (1985), , p. 2 The founders of sociology had critical reaction to rationalization: Capitalism Rationalization formed a central concept in the foundation of classical sociology, particularly with respect to the emphasis the discipline placed ‚Äì by contrast with anthropology ‚Äì on the nature of modern Western societies. The term was presented by the profoundly influential German antipositivist Max Weber, though its themes bear parallel with the critiques of modernity set forth by a number of scholars. A rejection of dialectism and sociocultural evolution informs the concept. Weber demonstrated rationalization in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which the aims of certain Protestant Theologies, particularly Calvinism, are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain as a way of dealing with their 'salvation anxiety'. The rational consequences of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with its religious roots, and so the latter were eventually discarded. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classifications of authority. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization.Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition Weber believed that a move towards rational-legal authority was inevitable. In charismatic authority, the death of a leader effectively ends the power of that authority, and only through a rationalized and bureaucratic base can this authority be passed on. Traditional authorities in rationalized societies also tend to develop a rational-legal base to better ensure a stable accession. (See also: Tripartite classification of authority) Whereas in traditional societies such as feudalism governing is managed under the traditional leadership of, for example, a queen or tribal chief, modern societies operate under rational-legal systems. For example, democratic systems attempt to remedy qualitative concerns (such as racial discrimination) with rationalized, quantitative means (for example, civil rights legislation). Weber described the eventual effects of rationalization in his Economy and Society as leading to a \\"polar night of icy darkness\\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in an \\"iron cage\\" (or \\"steel- hard casing\\") of rule-based, rational control. J√ºrgen Habermas has argued that understanding rationalization properly requires going beyond Weber's notion of rationalization. It requires distinguishing between instrumental rationality, which involves calculation and efficiency (in other words, reducing all relationships to those of means and ends), and communicative rationality, which involves expanding the scope of mutual understanding in communication, the ability to expand this understanding through reflective discourse about communication, and making social and political life subject to this expanded understanding. =The Holocaust, modernity and ambivalence= The railway line leading to the death camp at Auschwitz II (Birkenau). For Zygmunt Bauman, rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be closely associated with the events of the Holocaust. In Modernity and Ambivalence, Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar. Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled and ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is constantly threatening. Bauman's most famous book, Modernity and the Holocaust, is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of these kinds of fears. Drawing upon Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno's books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman argues that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he says, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorization of different species, and the tendency to view rule-following as morally good all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass. For this reason, Bauman argues that modern societies have not fully taken on board the lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed ‚Äì to use Bauman's metaphor ‚Äì like a picture hanging on a wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' par excellence in Europe;Modernity and the Holocaust, p. 53. the Final Solution was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher Giorgio Agamben, contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today. =Adorno and Horkheimer's definition of \\"enlightenment\\"= In their analysis of contemporary western society, Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944, revised 1947), Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer developed a wide and pessimistic concept of enlightenment. In their analysis, enlightenment had its dark side: while trying to abolish superstition and myths by 'foundationalist' philosophy, it ignored its own 'mythical' basis. Its strivings towards totality and certainty led to an increasing instrumentalization of reason. In their view, the enlightenment itself should be enlightened and not posed as a 'myth-free' view of the world. For Marxist philosophy in general, rationalization is closely associated with the concept of \\"commodity fetishism\\", for the reason that not only are products designed to fulfill certain tasks, but employees are hired to fulfill specific tasks as well. Consumption The sign at a McDonald's 'drive-thru'. The \\"over 99 billion served\\" statement illustrates Ritzer's idea of calculability. Modern food consumption typifies the process of rationalization. Where food preparation in traditional societies is more laborious and technically inefficient, modern society has strived towards speed and precision in its delivery. Fast-food restaurants, designed to maximise profit, have strived toward total efficiency since their conception, and continue to do so. A strict level of efficiency has been accomplished in several ways, including stricter control of its workers' actions, the replacement of more complicated systems with simpler, less time-consuming ones, simple numbered systems of value meals and the addition of drive-through windows. Rationalization is also observable in the replacement of more traditional stores, which may offer subjective advantages to consumers, such as what sociologists consider a less regulated, more natural environment, with modern stores offering the objective advantage of lower prices to consumers. The case of Wal-Mart is one strong example demonstrating this transition. While Wal-Marts have attracted considerable criticism for effectively displacing more traditional stores, these subjective social-value concerns have held minimal effectiveness in limiting expansion of the enterprise, particularly in more rationalized nations, due to the preferences of the public for lower prices over the advantages sociologists claim for more traditional stores.Boaz, David. (November 8, 1996). \\"Chrysler, Microsoft, and Industrial Policy .\\" Cato Institute. Retrieved on August 17, 2006. The sociologist George Ritzer has used the term McDonaldization to refer, not just to the actions of the fast food restaurant, but to the general process of rationalization. Ritzer distinguishes four primary components of McDonaldization: * Efficiency ‚Äì the optimal method for accomplishing a task; the fastest method to get from point A to point B. Efficiency in McDonaldization means that every aspect of the organization is geared toward the minimization of time. * Calculability ‚Äì goals are quantifiable (i.e., sales, money) rather than subjective (i.e., taste, labour). McDonaldization developed the notion that quantity equals quality, and that a large amount of product delivered to the customer in a short amount of time is the same as a high quality product. \\"They run their organization in such a way that a person can walk into any McDonald's and receive the same sandwiches prepared in precisely the same way. This results in a highly rational system that specifies every action and leaves nothing to chance\\". * Predictability ‚Äì standardized and uniform services. \\"Predictability\\" means that no matter where a person goes, they will receive the same service and receive the same product at every interaction with the corporation. This also applies to the workers in those organizations; their tasks are highly repetitive and predictable routines. * Control ‚Äì standardized and uniform employees, replacement of human by non-human technologies. Commercialization As capitalism itself is a rationalized economic policy, so is the process of commercialization it utilizes in order to increase sales. Most holidays, for instance, were created out of a religious context or in celebration of some past event. However, in rationalized societies these traditional values are increasingly diminished and the aim shifts from the qualitative aim of a meaningful celebration to the more quantitative aim of increasing sales. In the United States, for example, most major holidays now are represented by rationalized, secularized figures which serve as a corporate totem. In more traditional environments, gifts are more often hand-crafted works which hold some symbolic meaning. This qualitative value of gifts diminishes in rationalized societies, where individuals often offer hints or speak directly about what present they are interested in receiving. In these societies, the value of a gift is more likely to be weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism). Further objects of rationalization =Human body= One rational tendency is towards increasing the efficiency and output of the human body. Several means can be employed in reaching this end, including trends towards regular exercise, dieting, increased hygiene, drugs, and an emphasis on optimal nutrition. As well as increasing lifespans, these allow for stronger, leaner, more optimized bodies for quickly performing tasks.See Michel Foucault's The History of Sexuality (subtitle: The Care of the Self, vol. 3), which identifies this rationalization as emerging from capitalist ideologies vis √† vis control of workers (i.e., in this case, specifically, their bodies) for the rigors of commerce and the marketplace. Another aspect of this is maintaining a certain level of physical attraction. Processes such as the combing of hair, use of a fragrance, having an appropriate haircut, and wearing certain clothes receive calculated use, that of giving off a certain impression to other individuals. In these cases, we see how rationalization does produce meaning and is not just simply a way to speed things up, i.e., a fat person is said to have poor self-control and discipline and thus you can now make personal judgments about them. Another trend is in the bureaucratization of processes that formerly might have been done through the home. This includes the use of hospitals for childbirth and the use of doctors to identify symptoms of an illness and to prescribe treatment. =Education= Rationalized education tends to focus less on subjects based around the use of critical discourse (for instance, religion) and more on matters of a calculated importance (such as business administration). This is reflected also in the move towards standardized and multiple choice testing, which measures students on the basis of numbered answers and against a uniform standard.

William Robertson (U.S. Army) and Lt. Alexander Silvashko (Red Army) stand facing one another with hands clasped and arms around each other's shoulders. In the background are two flags and a poster. Elbe Day, April 25, 1945, is the day Soviet and American troops met at the Elbe River, near Torgau in Germany, marking an important step toward the end of World War II in Europe. This contact between the Soviets, advancing from the East, and the Americans, advancing from the West, meant that the two powers had effectively cut Germany in two. Elbe Day has never been an official holiday in any country, but in the years after 1945 the memory of this friendly encounter gained new significance in the context of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. History The first contact between American and Soviet patrols occurred near Strehla, after First Lieutenant Albert Kotzebue, an American soldier, crossed the River Elbe in a boat with three men of an intelligence and reconnaissance platoon. On the east bank they met forward elements of a Soviet Guards rifle regiment of the First Ukrainian Front, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Gordeyev. The same day, another patrol under Second Lieutenant William Robertson with Frank Huff, James McDonnell and Paul Staub met a Soviet patrol commanded by Lieutenant Alexander Silvashko on the destroyed Elbe bridge of Torgau.Time Magazine On April 26, the commander of the 69th Infantry Division of the First Army, Emil F. Reinhardt, and the commander of the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army, Vladimir Rusakov, met at Torgau, southwest of Berlin. Arrangements were made for the formal \\"Handshake of Torgau\\" between Robertson and Silvashko in front of photographers the following day, April 27. The Soviet, American, and British governments released simultaneous statements that evening in London, Moscow, and Washington, reaffirming the determination of the three Allied powers to complete the destruction of the Third Reich. Commemorations Nikolay Makarov with Admiral Mike Mullen and Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak at Arlington National Cemetery during the Elbe Day commemorations in 2010. At the 2015 commemoration of Elbe Day, Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak bows his head after laying a wreath at the Spirit of the Elbe marker in Arlington National Cemetery. Monuments at Torgau, Lorenzkirch, and Bad Liebenwerda commemorate the first encounters between U.S. and Soviet troops on Elbe Day. In the United States, a \\"Spirit of the Elbe\\" plaque at Arlington National Cemetery commemorates the day. In 1949 the Soviet film studio Mosfilm commemorated Elbe Day in the black-and-white film Encounter at the Elbe. During the Cold War the meeting of the two armies was often recalled as a symbol of peace and friendship between the people of the two antagonistic superpowers. For example, in 1961 the popular Russian song \\"Do the Russians Want War?\\" evoked the memory of American and Soviet soldiers embracing at the Elbe River. Joseph Polowsky, an American soldier who met Soviet troops on Elbe Day, was deeply affected by the experience and devoted much of his life to opposing war. He commemorated Elbe Day each year in his hometown of Chicago and unsuccessfully petitioned the United Nations to make April 25 a \\"World Day of Peace.\\" His remains are buried in a cemetery in Torgau. American singer-songwriter Fred Small commemorated Joseph Polowsky and Elbe Day in his song \\"At The Elbe\\". In 1988 a plaque titled \\"Der Geist der Elbe\\" (\\"Spirit of the Elbe\\") was mounted on a stone near Torgau at the site of the encounter between troops of the U.S. 69th Infantry and the Soviet Guards. In 1995 the Russian Federation issued a three-ruble coin commemorating the 50th anniversary of Elbe Day. By 2010, the 65th anniversary of the event, Elbe Day events in Torgau were held annually on the weekend closest to April 25, attracting tourists to the city. Also in 2010, the U.S. and Russian presidents for the first time issued a joint statement on April 25 commemorating Elbe Day and the \\"spirit of the Elbe\\". The meeting at the Elbe is represented in the war strategy game R.U.S.E., released in 2010 and 2011 and based loosely on World War II events.

He began his career with Manchester United and was one of the \\"Busby Babes\\" who survived the Munich air disaster of 1958. Although he sustained severe injuries, he recovered and continued to play league football for Newcastle United, Lincoln City and Mansfield Town. He then went on to play non-league football until his retirement.  Early life  Scanlon (front row, third from left) in a Manchester United team photo in 1957 Born in Hulme, Manchester, Scanlon was a nephew of former Manchester United winger Charlie Mitten. He attended St Wilfred's School in Hulme. His talent for football was noticed early on, and he was selected to play for the Manchester Boys side. He joined the Manchester United groundstaff in 1950, before signing a professional contract in December 1952.  Manchester United  Scanlon made his way through the Manchester United youth system, winning two FA Youth Cups in 1953 and 1954 before making his first-team debut against Arsenal on 20 November 1954. Scanlon was involved in two league title wins ‚Äì in 1956 and 1957 ‚Äì but he failed to make enough appearances to earn a winners' medal on either occasion, with David Pegg being United's regular left winger during this time. Scanlon was occasionally used as a right winger, which was the regular position of Johnny Berry. On 5 February 1958, Scanlon started on the left wing in United's European Cup quarter-final second leg away to Red Star Belgrade; for five of the players who started the game, it was to be their last ever match for the club. The next day, on the return journey to Manchester, the team's plane crashed while attempting to take off from Munich airport, in an incident that later became known as the Munich air disaster. The crash claimed the lives of 23 of the plane's 44 passengers and crew, so Scanlon was relatively fortunate to escape with just a fractured skull, a broken leg and kidney damage. His injuries put him out of action for the rest of the season. He made a full recovery and was back in action at the start of the following season, going on to appear in every game that season, scoring 16 goals in the process.  Later career  Scanlon was sold to Newcastle United for ¬£18,000 in November 1960, but his time on Tyneside was not a success and he then dropped down to a lower level to play for Lincoln City in February 1962. He was on the move again just over a year later, joining Mansfield Town in April 1963, just in time to participate in the club's celebrations at being promoted to the Third Division. Mansfield narrowly missed out on promotion to the Second Division two years later, finishing third in Division Three, but they dropped to 19th the following season and Scanlon took the opportunity to drop out of league football. He joined Belper Town in 1966, and retired not long afterwards.  Later years and death  After he retired from football, Scanlon returned to the Manchester area and worked in a succession of jobs outside football, including working as a security guard at a Colgate-Palmolive factory near Old Trafford, and being a docker in Salford.https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester- news/survivors-anger-over-munich-crash-1016003 In 2006, he complained about inaccuracies in a recent BBC documentary about the Munich air disaster :: see Munich air disaster#Dramatisations. On 13 May 2007, Scanlon presented the Premier League trophy to Manchester United along with former teammate Bill Foulkes. He attended United's victorious European Cup final appearance in May 2008 in Moscow, being flown to the game in Russia on a private jet hired by United along with fellow Munich survivors Sir Bobby Charlton and Harry Gregg. Bill Foulkes, the other remaining survivor, attended the game as well. Scanlon was admitted to the Salford Royal hospital in the Hope area of Pendleton, Salford with kidney problems and pneumonia on 21 October 2009. He was in intensive care for more than a month, before dying on 22 December 2009, at the age of 74. His funeral was held on 13 January 2010, and more than 300 people attended the service at All Souls' Church in Weaste, including fellow Munich survivors Bobby Charlton, Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes, and former Manchester United players Denis Law and Nobby Stiles.

footballer. He graduated from Manchester United's youth system and played for the club on 117 occasions, winning two league titles, before his career was cut short due to injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster. He was also capped 12 times at senior level by Northern Ireland. He was the younger brother of Danny Blanchflower, the captain of the Tottenham Hotspur side that dominated English football in the early 1960s.  Career  = Manchester United = Blanchflower (back row, second from left) in a Manchester United team photo in 1957 Blanchflower's first appearance in a professional game was for Manchester United on 24 November 1951 against Liverpool, away at Anfield. He became a regular first team player in the 1953‚Äì54 season, when he played in 27 out of 42 league games and scored 13 goals as an inside-forward. He helped the club win the league title in 1956 and again in 1957. Nicknamed \\"Twiggy\\" by his teammates, he was renowned for his versatility. He began his career as a left-half before the emergence of Duncan Edwards in this position, when he switched to the forward positions, but the Manchester United manager Matt Busby recognised his intelligent positioning sense and aerial power and chose to play him at centre-half by the 1955‚Äì56 season, with John Doherty and Billy Whelan now competing for his former position, although he faced fierce competition for the solitary centre- half place due to the presence of Mark Jones. He covered in goal in the 1957 FA Cup Final while Ray Wood received treatment for an injury suffered in a collision with Peter McParland, who scored both of Aston Villa's goals as United lost 2‚Äì1. Blanchflower also played in some of United's first European Cup fixtures. He scored 27 goals during his time at the club, most of them during his time as a forward. = Munich air disaster = On 6 February 1958, the Manchester United team that had travelled to Belgrade for the second leg of a European cup tie had their chartered plane stop in Munich to refuel. Weather conditions caused the plane to crash when the pilot attempted to take- off from Munich airport and 23 of the 44 people on board were killed. Blanchflower was severely injured, suffering from a fractured pelvis and arms and legs, and crushed kidneys, and his right arm was nearly severed. He was in hospital for two months and was read the last rites in the early days (despite his Protestant upbringing), but survived.Obituary in The Independent (UK) He tried to return to football, but never made a full recovery. Doctors advised him not to return to football because of fears he would damage his kidney and, a year later, Blanchflower retired from football. The Munich air disaster meant that he had played his last game of football when still only 24 years old, having earned 12 caps for Northern Ireland, played well over 100 times for Manchester United and won two league championship medals.  Personal life  The callous attitude of Manchester United towards Blanchflower after injury forced the end of his playing career was revealed by journalist David Conn in a 2000 article in The Independent: He and Jean were married in 1956. He eventually pursued studies in finance and began a career as an accountant. He later became an after-dinner speaker and was a regular on the after-dinner circuits until his death from cancer on 2 September 1998. He was 65 years old, and just two weeks before he died he had attended the Munich air disaster testimonial match at Old Trafford. He was survived by his three children; Krista, Senior (born 1958), Laurie (born 1961) and Andrew (born 1963),RTBot: Jackie Blanchflower obituary as well as his wife Jean, who died in 2002 after a long illness. He outlived his older brother Danny, who died in December 1993.

Career Born in Berkeley, California, Cometbus started writing fanzines in 1981 with Jesse Michaels (later of Operation Ivy and Common Rider) and started his own after Michaels moved to Pennsylvania in October 1981. He became an active participant in the Gilman Street Project and was a founding member of Crimpshrine, a highly influential East Bay punk rock band which also featured Jeff Ott.Profile , Punknews.org; accessed August 17, 2015. In a September 2016 interview Cometbus described how his personal life is not necessarily reflected in his zines stating, \\"Growing up, I was just really, really restless. I felt cooped up. Every band interview I did was about being on the road. When I finally got to cut loose, I went on three tours in two years, then had the band drop me off in the first city where I could find a room. So I‚Äôd made it out, but then came the news: my mom had cancer. I spent the next fifteen years going back and forth‚Äîcaretaking first her and then my dad when they were doing badly, and when they were in remission, I‚Äôd get as far away as I could. When both were dead, I moved to New York, where I‚Äôve lived ever since. That‚Äôs my life, in a nutshell. Which answers your earlier question about how much the fanzine reflected my personal life. Not so much.\\" After the demise of Crimpshrine, Cometbus formed Pinhead Gunpowder with a handful of people from the East Bay punk scene, including Sarah Kirsch (later replaced by Jason White), Bill Schneider and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day.Profile , SFBG.com; accessed July 17, 2015. He toured as a roadie with Green Day for many years and played drums for a few shows after the departure of John Kiffmeyer, he was replaced by another temporary drummer Dave \\"E.C.\\" Henwood and before Tre Cool joined. He has played in a multitude of short-lived bands that generally release just a seven-inch or two before breaking up (see Band history). He is a co-owner of a used bookstore in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, called Book Thug Nation and a used bookstore in Bushwick called \\"Human Relations\\" Cometbus zine Cometbus is most famous for publishing the zine Cometbus, which he began in Berkeley, California in 1981. Cometbus has self- published the usually-handwritten zine ever since, despite a few breaks. The name Cometbus was coined by Gregg Turkington during the early days of the magazine when the name changed from issue to issue. Cometbus consisted of band interviews, personal diaries, artwork, and observations on the punk subculture in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. The zine captured a slice of life in Oakland and Berkeley from the late 1980s through the 1990s. From 2004-06, Cometbus took a hiatus from writing Cometbus to pursue publishing his writing through other channels. Cometbus came out of retirement in 2006 with the release of Cometbus #50, the 25th anniversary issue of the magazine. Originally planned as a letters only issue, it features band interviews (for the first time since issue #24), short stories, and book store reviews. Cometbus #51, The Loneliness of the Electric Menorah, was released in September 2008. It chronicles the history of Moe's Books and other longtime businesses on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California. Cometbus #52, The Spirit of St-Louis, Or, How to Break Your Own Heart, A Tragedy in 24 Parts, was released in 2009. Cometbus says in his blurb: \\"It all starts with the story I've told so many times it's turned stale and tired from overuse. There I was, dropped off in a city far from home. I didn't know a soul or have a hope, and so on...\\" Both issue #52 of Cometbus and the novel I Wish There Was Something That I Could Quit are rumored to be about his stay and relationships in Pensacola, Florida. Cometbus #53 features contributions from Maddalena Poletta and a cover by Eisner Award winner Nate Powell. Released in 2009, it features a lengthy piece on art, comics, and the early days of punk in NYC in the mid-1970s that is largely derived from an in-depth interview Cometbus conducted with John Holstrom, the co-founder of the legendary Punk Magazine. Cometbus #54, In China with Green Day?, released in February 2011, is about Cometbus' and Green Day's tour of Asia in 2010. Cometbus #55, Pen Pals, was released in February 2013. Cometbus #56, A Bestiary of Booksellers details the NYC used book trade.

The extremely limited print runs of the zine have been somewhat ameliorated over the years by a number of collections. Despite Everything: A Cometbus Omnibus (Last Gasp Publishing 2002, ) a 608-page compendium of selections from 43 early Cometbus issues which are long out of print and often difficult to find. Double Duce (Last Gasp Publishing 2003; ) a novel based on life in a punk house called Double Duce that collects material from issues 32, 35, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, and 45. Add Toner (Last Gasp Publishing 2011, ) compiles issues 44, 45, 46, 46 1/2, 47 & 48 in full, along with a collection of stories entitled \\"8 out of 10 days\\" . Other writing In addition to writing for his own zine, Cometbus has contributed stories to several other zines such as Absolutely Zippo, Maximumrocknroll, and Tales of Blarg, occasionally writing under the pseudonym Skrub. His work is easily recognizable by his distinctive, block-lettered handwritten script. His handwriting also appears in the liner notes of early Green Day albums and Jawbreaker's Etc. compilation. A novel titled I Wish There Was Something That I Could Quit, was published on March 15, 2006. This novel was loosely based on his experiences in Pensacola during the start of the Iraq War and is arguably his most political work. He released a few smaller collections of short stories, Mixed Reviews and Chicago Stories (self published, 2004), a small collection about Chicago originally published in \\"Cometbus\\" issues 35, 37, 38, 41, and 45. Cometbus also released a book of poetry entitled \\"Last Supper\\" in 2014 through ARP Books. Two collections have been translated into French, including En d√©pit de tout (1997). A French version of Cometbus issue 54, titled \\"En Chine avec Green Day\\", has also been published by Editions Chat Chuffit in 2013.

A painting by Peter Nicolai Arbo Hlod or Hl√∂d was the illegitimate son of Heidrek, the king of the Geats, in Norse mythology. He appears in the Hervarar saga and probably also as Hlith in Widsith, line 115, together with his father Hei√∞rekr (Heathoric), half-brother Angantyr (Incgentheow), and his mother Sifka (Sifeca). Claiming his inheritance Hl√∂d had grown up with his grandfather Humli, the king of the Huns, and he was both handsome and valiant. As soon as he was born he was given weapons and horses, as was the custom of the time. When Hl√∂d heard that his father Heidrek was dead and that his half- brother Angantyr had been proclaimed king of the Goths, his grandfather Humli said that Hlod had to go to Arheimar and demand his rightful inheritance. Hl√∂d arrived to Arheimar with many Hunnish warriors. He found a man outside of the hall and asked him to go inside and tell Angantyr that his brother wished to see him. When King Angantyr learnt of who was waiting outside for him, he cast down his knife, took his mailcoat, his white shield in one hand and Tyrfing in the other. Then he asked Hl√∂d to come in and drink with them in honour of their dead father. However, Hl√∂d answered that he had not come to feast, he wanted half of everything that Angantyr had inherited from their father: cow and calf, handmills, tools and weapons, treasures, slaves, bondmaids, sons and daughters, Myrkvi√∞r, the grave, the carved stone beside Dniepr, Heidrek's armour, lands, liegemen and rings. Angantyr refused to share with Hl√∂d and said that he had no right to inherit, but in recompense Hl√∂d would get lances, wealth, cattle, a thousand thralls, a thousand horses and a thousand armoured bondsmen. Before leaving all of them would receive riches and a maid. Hl√∂d would get his measure in silver and gold, and he would be given a whole third of the land of the Goths to rule. However, Gizur Grytingalidi, the aged king of the Geats, who was visiting in order to bid farewell to his dead foster-son Heidrek, thought that Angantyr was too generous. Gizur stated that Hl√∂d was only a bastard and the son of a slave-girl, and should not receive so princely a gift. Offended by being called a bastard and a slave-girl's son, Hl√∂d returned to the Huns and to Humli. He told Humli that Angantyr had refused to share the kingdom with him, and when Humli insisted he also said that he had been called the son of a slave. Mustering the Horde Humli decided that they muster all the might of the Huns and attack the Goths. As soon as spring arrived they gathered an army so vast, that the steppes were depleted of men of fighting age. Every man who could carry arms down to twelve-year-olds, and every horse from two years of age and older. All in all the Huns mustered a horde of 343,200 mounted warriors. The Death of Hervor, Hl√∂d's sister When the horde was gathered they rode through Myrkvi√∞r which separated Reidgotaland from the land of the Huns. As the horde came out of the forest they arrived at a populous country of flat plains. On the plains there was a fortress with a strong garrison commanded by Hervor, the sister of Angantyr and Hl√∂d, together with Ormar, her foster-father. One morning as the sun was rising above the steppes, Hervor stood on a watchtower and saw a great cloudstorm rising southwards over the forest. It hid the sun for a long time. Suddenly, she saw under the cloud a mass of gold. There were gilded helmets, shields and corselets and she realized that it was the horde which had arrived. Hervor asked the trumpeter to blow a summons to gather the forces. Then she told Ormar to ride and meet the Huns and challenge them to do battle in front of the southern gate. Ormar rode to the Goths and told them that they would do battle outside the southern gate. Outside that gate, there was a mighty battle, and since the horde was much larger, the Goths fell and finally Hervor was slain. When Ormar saw her die he retreated together with all those who were faint of heart. He rode day and night to reach king Angantyr in Arheimar. The Goths prepare As the Huns pillaged and burnt far and wide in Reidgotaland, Ormar arrived at Arheimar and related that the marches were burning at the hands of the Huns and that his sister was dead. Angantyr's lips were drawn back and said that his brother had not treated Hervor like a sister, and then he watched his small company and stated that the more men one needs the less one has. Gizur, the aged King of the Geats, said that he would fight for Angantyr and he would ask for no recompense. Heidrek had instated a law that if an army invaded a land and the king of that country marked a field with hazel poles, the marauding army would stop pillaging until there had been battle inside the poles. The old Gizur armed himself with good weapons and leapt on his horse like a young man. Then he asked where Angantyr desired to meet the Huns. Angantyr answered that he wished to meet them on the plains of the Danube below the Hills of Ash, where the Goths had oft been victorious. :B√Ω√∞ ek y√∞r at Dylgju :ok √° D√∫nhei√∞i :orrostu undir :Jassarfj√∂llum; :hr√¶ s√© y√∞r :at h√°i hverjum, :ok l√°ti sv√° √ì√∞inn flein flj√∫ga, :sem ek fyrir m√¶li Gizur rode so close to the Huns that they could hear him and shouted that Odin was angry with them and that they were doomed. Hlod cried that they should seize Gizur, but Humli said that lone heralds must not be hurt. Gizur called out that the Goths were afraid of neither the Huns nor their bows, and then he hastened to Angantyr to report about the size of the horde. Angantyr sent messengers to every part of the land to summon every able-bodied man. He then marched to the Danube with his great army and met the great army of the Huns. The great battle They fought for eight days. No one could count the fallen but still no captains had been slain. Day and night the armies clashed around Angantyr, and the fight grew more and more bitter. The Huns became more and more ferocious as they knew that they would not survive a defeat. The Goths, on the other hand, were fighting for their freedom and for the land where they were born. When the eighth day ended, the Goths pushed forward breaking the Hunnic lines. The Huns lost their courage as they saw Angantyr ride through the lines slashing and cutting men and horses with Tyrfing. Angantyr and Hlod met and Hlod fell, as well as Humli. The Huns fled but the Goths pursued them and filled the rivers with bodies so that they choked and this caused a flood which filled the valleys with dead men and horses. Angantyr searched among the slain and finally found his brother. He stated that cruel is the doom of the Norns when brother slays brother. :B√∂lvat er okkr, br√≥√∞ir, :bani em ek √æinn or√∞inn, :√æat mun √¶ uppi, :illr er d√≥mr norna.

It can persist across generations, and when applied to developing countries, is also known as a development trap. Families trapped in the cycle of poverty, have either limited or no resources. There are many disadvantages that collectively work in a circular process making it virtually impossible for individuals to break the cycle.Marger (2008). Examples of these disadvantages working in a circular process would be: economic decline, low personal income, no funds for school, which leads to lack of education. The lack of education results in unemployment and lastly low national productivity. Social Inequality: Patterns and Processes. McGraw Hill publishing. 4th edition. This occurs when poor people do not have the resources necessary to get out of poverty, such as financial capital, education, or connections. In other words, impoverished individuals do not have access to economic and social resources as a result of their poverty. This lack may increase their poverty. This could mean that the poor remain poor throughout their lives.Hutchinson Encyclopedia, Cycle of poverty Ruby K. Payne, author of A Framework for Understanding Poverty, distinguishes between situational poverty, which can generally be traced to a specific incident within the lifetimes of the person or family members in poverty, and generational poverty, which is a cycle that passes from generation to generation, and goes on to argue that generational poverty has its own distinct culture and belief patterns.Payne, R. (2005). A framework for understanding poverty (4th edition). Highland, TX: aha! Process, Inc. Measures of social mobility examine how frequently poor people become wealthier, and how often children are wealthier or achieve higher income than their parents. Causes of the cycle =Chronic general poverty= Poverty can be created or sustained for large numbers of people through general economic conditions, which tend to be self-sustaining. Metrics for these conditions include: * Low gross domestic product or overall low productivity, failing to produce enough wealth for the population as a whole to escape poverty * High unemployment, creating poverty for the unemployed and putting downward pressure on wages * High income inequality, creating poverty by allocating wealth unevenly * Low social mobility, perpetuating poverty for a given person or family There are also various poverty metrics that directly indicate its extent, generally involving income, wealth, or both. It can be measured on an absolute scale (which might put almost an entire country's population below the poverty line) or in a relative way, identifying people who are poor compared to others in the same country. Countries with chronically low levels of economic development fail to provide opportunities for many individuals to leave poverty. These may be caused by: * Problems with the means of production: ** Lack of or poor quality infrastructure ** Widespread lack of skills needed for employment (including literacy) or high-wage employment ** Lack of equipment and automation that would boost productivity * Economic mismanagement, such as regulatory failure * Widespread corruption * Inability of the government to guarantee stable market conditions, including physical security and enforceable property rights * High burden of disease * Barriers to international trade, possibly including international sanctions =Non- circular causes of poverty= Generally poor economic conditions can also be due to temporary causes, which might not result in a \\"cycle of poverty\\" if the economy recovers thereafter. Temporary economic problems can be caused by: * Recession (for which there are many causes) and the lower-activity portion of the business cycle * Climate change * Disasters ** War, whether through direct destruction or general funding burden ** Natural disasters, including storms, drought, and earthquakes ** Epidemics ** Famine ** Anthropogenic disasters, including accidents A one-time event, whether affecting the economy in general or personal in nature, can push a given person or family into poverty, after which they enter the \\"cycle of poverty\\" which is difficult to escape. Examples of personal events that can have a negative economic impact include: * The loss of a job or failure of a family-owned business * A health issue, which can result in lost wages, a permanent disability, or medical debt in countries without free universal health care * The death of a family member * An unplanned pregnancy * Short-term financial mismanagement of personal savings or debt * A breakup or divorce, if alimony does not compensate for the loss of one partner's income * A foreclosure or eviction * An automobile collision or other loss of a vehicle needed to get to work * Commission of a crime that results in a criminal record and difficulty obtaining work * Incarceration that results in loss of economic assets and social networks =Factors maintaining personal poverty= Once poor, people can experience difficulty escaping poverty because many things that would allow them to do so require money they don't have, such as: * Education and retraining with new skills * Child care which would enable a single parent or second parent to work or take classes * Transportation to a distant job * Migration to an area with better economic opportunities * Starting a new business, which might require market research, technical assistance, and startup funding * Obtaining land for subsistence farming * Cure a health condition that prevents work, including diseases of poverty which don't affect people outside of the \\"cycle of poverty\\" According to the United States Census, in 2012 people aged 18‚Äì64 living in poverty in the country gave the reason they did not work, by Why the Poor Don't Work, According to the Poor * 31% - Ill or disabled * 26% - Home or family reasons * 21% - School or other * 13% - Cannot find work * 8% - Retired early Some activities can also cost poor people more than wealthier people: * Rent ‚Äì If unable to afford the first month's rent and security deposit for a typical apartment lease, people sometimes must live in a hotel or motel at a higher daily rate.Nickel and Dimed * Food ** If unable to afford an apartment with a refrigerator, kitchen, and stove, people may need to spend more on prepared meals than if they could cook for themselves and store leftovers. ** Buying in bulk (large quantities) is usually cheaper than buying small quantities in multiple transactions, but poor people are less likely to have cash on hand to finance a large purchase of food needed for the more distant future. Poor people are less able to afford delivery or automobile transport of quantities too large to carry on public transit or bicycle. ** People who live in food deserts without access to fast transportation may buy more expensive food from nearby convenience stores, and have more difficulty transporting perishable goods. * Banking ‚Äì People who cannot maintain a minimum daily balance in a savings account are often charged fees by the bank, whereas people with larger amounts of wealth can earn interest on savings and substantial returns from investments. Unbanked people must use higher-cost alternative financial services, such as check-cashing services for payroll and money orders for transferring to other people. People who have had previous credit problems, such as overdrafting an account, may not be eligible to open a checking or savings account. Major reasons for not opening a bank account include not trusting banks, being concerned about not making a payment due to a bank error or delay, not understanding how banks work, and not having enough money to qualify for a free account.A Place Called Jubilee * Debt ‚Äì People who have no net savings sometimes have to use high- interest credit cards or other loans to pay for emergency expenses or even daily needs. Interest must be paid on debt, and a lower credit score (which can result from a low income) typically results in a higher interest rate, such as for a subprime mortgage. Payday loans can have an extremely high interest rate, and other forms of debt not typically used by high-income consumers include refund anticipation loans, car title loans, and pawnshops. * Overdue payments ‚Äì People who cannot afford to pay all of their bills on time, or who accidentally make a late payment due to waiting until the last possible day can incur late fees not affecting people who can simple schedule automatic payments from savings. * Furniture ‚Äì If unable to afford a piece of furniture, a rent-to-own agreement can make it available without having savings, but at a higher long-term cost. * Transportation ‚Äì If unable to afford a car, taking public transportation can take longer, effectively an increased cost in the form of lost time. Many poor people must live further away from work in order to find housing they can afford. * Health care ‚Äì Though most industrialized countries have free universal health care, in the United States and many developing countries, people with little savings often postpone expensive medical treatment as long as possible. This can cause a relatively small medical condition to become a serious condition that costs more to treat, and possibly causing lost wages due to missed hourly work. (Though poor people may have lower overall personal medical expenses simply because illnesses and medical conditions go untreated, and on average life span is shorter.) Higher- income workers typically have medical insurance which prevents them from experiencing excessive costs and often provides free preventive care for example this reason. In addition to personal savings they can use, higher- income workers are also more likely to be salaried and get sick time that prevents them from losing wages while seeking treatment. Because no skills or experience are required, some people in poverty make money by volunteering for medical studies or donating blood plasma.One Day, Two Dollars * Government benefits may require paperwork or attendance at mandatory classes that a job wouldn't, effectively an increased cost in the form of lost time per unit of money taken in. Government policy, government funding, and access to financial services can play a large role in preventing one-time events from pushing people into poverty, and in overcoming barriers to escaping poverty. People who cannot work due to a disability often rely on government assistance, family members, or charities, but may also have personal savings. Many governments have programs to support the elderly, given that many have not saved enough money to last throughout their planned retirement, and that many will experience health problems that prevent them from working. Inability to work can present an insurmountable barrier to exiting poverty if external assistance is insufficient. = Internal and external factors sustaining poverty = Amongst the most popular characterizations of the ongoing experience of poverty are that (1) it is systemic or institutionalized or (2) a person is misguided by emotional challenges driven by historical experiences or (3) a person is affected by a mental disability, or a combination of all three reasons (Bertrand, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2004).  Systemic factors  Donald Curtis (2006), a researcher at the School of Public Policy in the United Kingdom, identified that governments regard the welfare system as an enabling task. Curtis (2006) maintained, however, that the system lacks cohesiveness, and is not designed to be an empowerment tool. For example, outside parties are funded to manage the effort without much oversight creating a disconnected system, for which no one leads (Curtis, 2006). The result is mismanagement of budget without forwarding progress, and those that remain in the poverty loophole are accused of draining the system (Curtis, 2006).  Emotional factors ‚Äì bias  Jill Suttie (2018),Suttie, J. (2017, January 31). How Adults Communicate Bias to Children. Retrieved June 20, 2019, from https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_adults_communicate_bias_to_children wrote that implicit bias, which can be transferred nonverbally to children with no more than a look or a gesture, and as such is a learned behavior. Critical thinking skills can ward off implicit bias, but without education and practice, habitual thoughts can cloud judgment and poorly affect future decisions.  Decision-making  A Dartmouth College (2016)Dartmouth College. (2016, April 26). Bias in how we learn and make decisions. Retrieved June 21, 2019, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160426115455.htm study reported that probabilistic decision-making follows prior-based knowledge of failure in similar situations. Rather than choose success, people respond as if the failure has already taken place. Those that have experienced intergenerational poverty are most susceptible to this kind of learned behavior (Wagmiller & Adelman, 2009).Wagmiller, R. L., & Adelman, R. M. (2009, November 30). NCCP  Childhood and Intergenerational Poverty. Retrieved June 21, 2019, from http://www.nccp.org/publications/pub_909.html  Intergenerational  Professors of Sociology Wagmiller and Adelman (2009) asserted that roughly 35‚Äì46% of people who have experienced hardship in young and middle adulthood also experienced moderate to severe poverty in poverty in childhood. As of 2018, 7.5 million people experienced poverty in California alone (Downs, 2018).  Medical factors ‚Äì mental illnesses  In a qualitative study, Rudnick et al., (2014), studied people living in poverty with mental illness and determined that participants felt that wellness care, nutrition, housing, and jobs were severely lacking. Respondents asserted that the most significant problem was access to quality services; bureaucratic systems appear to be devoid of logic and treatment by providers were often unaccommodating and uncooperative (Rudnick et al., 2014).  Summary  The thread of these examples is a general lack of critical thinking employed by those designing systems, providing care, or experiencing setbacks. Perhaps, future systems can include leadership with an emphasis on critical thinking. Government agencies can work towards accountability of design and cohesiveness and between agencies. Training for healthcare providers can consist of ways to identify and eliminate bias. Counseling can be of help for those experiencing poverty to reverse negative thought patterns brought on by a repetitive pattern of negative probabilistic thinking. =Choices and culture= Personal choices and cultural influences can also make it difficult to escape poverty, such as: * Choosing not to pursue education and skills that could be used to obtain a high-paying job * A culture that disvalues education * Low expectations for academic and economic success can be a self-fulfilling prophecy * Belief that one is self-limited and destined to remain trapped in poverty * Belief that one is a victim and powerless to break free from poverty =Discrimination and concentration= Discrimination can make it more difficult to access government programs, to find work, and to access resources and social networks that could help. For a variety of reasons, it is more difficult to escape poverty in areas of concentrated poverty, where poor people may be forced to live by economic circumstance. Racial segregation can represent a combination of both discrimination and concentration. =Generational poverty= Generational poverty is poverty that is inherited across generations. This can happen because: * Poor parents who know what their children need to succeed academically or economically cannot afford to provide that, such as tuition, books, tutoring, after-school programs, health care, transportation to school, safe housing, clothing, or adequate nutrition. * Parents who are outside social networks that would be useful for economic advancement cannot introduce those children into those networks. * Poor parents may pressure older children to drop out of school and work, for immediate wages at the expense of education that could provide higher long-term wages. * Parents who have themselves not attended secondary education, may not realize the advantages of attendance, and may not know when or how to apply. * Poorly educated parents might not know how to nurture the cognitive development of their children, and might be less able to provide educational assistance like help with homework. * Parents who have made poor personal decisions may be bad role models for success, for example normalizing financial mismanagement or substance abuse. * Child abuse creates a number of physical and psychological problems that increase the probability of growing up poor, and the vast majority of abusive parents were themselves abused as children. = Early childhood adversity and basic needs stressors contributing to the cycle of generational poverty = *The stress of early childhood adversities, including basic need stressors and, at times, abuse and neglect are major causes of generational poverty. Studies have shown that the trauma of child abuse manifests negatively in adult life in overall health and even in employment status. Abuse and neglect are potential adversities facing those in poverty, the adversity that is shared among all below the poverty line is the daily stress over basic needs. \\"The stress of meeting basic needs takes all precedent in the family, and children learn that the only way to survive is to focus on getting basic needs met\\". Every member of a household in poverty lives the struggle of basic needs stressors and is impacted by it. The ability to secure and pay for childcare is another contributing factor to the problems those in poverty have with finding and keeping a job. These stressors are not just unpleasant, they are catastrophic to a body's health and development. Exposure to chronic stress can induce changes in the architecture of different regions of the developing brain (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus), which can impact a range of important functions, such as regulating the stress response, attention, memory, planning, and learning new skills, and also contribute to dysregulation of inflammatory response systems that can lead to a chronic ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù effect on multiple organ systems. Chronic stress is detrimental to our health and has even been proven to harm memory and organs, including the brain. Working memory, defined as a human's capacity to store information in the brain for immediate use, is known to be shorter for children raised in poverty versus those raised in even a middle-class environment. This proves that from the earliest of years suffering through basic needs stressors, children have to work harder to learn and absorb information. Family background A 2002 research paper titled \\"The Changing Effect of Family Background on the Incomes of American Adults\\" analyzed changes in the determinants of family income between 1961 and 1999, focusing on the effect of parental education, occupational rank, income, marital status, family size, region of residence, race, and ethnicity. The paper (1) outlines a simple framework for thinking about how family background affects children's family and income, (2) summarizes previous research on trends in intergenerational inheritance in the United States, (3) describes the data used as a basis for the research which it describes, (4) discusses trends in inequality among parents, (5) describes how the effects of parental inequality changed between 1961 and 1999, (6) contrasts effects at the top and bottom of the distribution, and (7) discusses whether intergenerational correlations of zero would be desirable. The paper concludes by posing the question of whether reducing the intergenerational correlation is an efficient strategy for reducing poverty or inequality. Because improving the skills of disadvantaged children seems relatively easy, it is an attractive strategy. However, judging by American experience since the 1960s, improving the skills of disadvantaged children has proved difficult. As a result, the paper suggests, there are probably cheaper and easier ways to reduce poverty and inequality, such as supplementing the wages of the poor or changing immigration policy so that it drives down the relative wages of skilled rather than unskilled workers. These alternative strategies would not reduce intergenerational correlations, but they would reduce the economic gap between children who started life with all the disadvantages instead of all the advantages. Another paper, titled Do poor children become poor adults?, which was originally presented at a 2004 symposium on the future of children from disadvantaged families in France, and was later included in a 2006 collection of papers related to the theme of the dynamics of inequality and poverty, discusses generational income mobility in North America and Europe. The paper opens by observing that in the United States almost one half of children born to low income parents become low income adults, four in ten in the United Kingdom, and one-third in Canada. The paper goes on to observe that rich children also tend to become rich adults‚Äîfour in ten in the U.S. and the U.K., and as many as one-third in Canada. The paper argues, however, that money is not the only or even the most important factor influencing intergenerational income mobility. The rewards to higher skilled and/or higher educated individuals in the labor market and the opportunities for children to obtain the required skills and credentials are two important factors. Reaching the conclusion that income transfers to lower income individuals may be important to children in the here and now, but they should not be counted on to strongly promote generational mobility. The paper recommends that governments focus on investments in children to ensure that they have the skills and opportunities to succeed in the labor market, and observes that though this has historically meant promoting access to higher and higher levels of education, it is becoming increasingly important that attention be paid to preschool and early childhood education. =Lack of jobs due to deindustrialization= Sociologist William Julius Wilson has said that the economic restructuring of changes from manufacturing to a service-based economy has led to a high percentage of joblessness in the inner-cities and with it a loss of skills and inability to find jobs. This \\"mismatch\\" of skills to jobs available is said to be the main driver of poverty. =Effects of modern education= Research shows that schools with students that perform lower than the norm are also those hiring least-qualified teachers as a result of new teachers generally working in the area that they grew up in. This leads to certain schools not producing many students that go on to college. Students from these schools that go on to be college graduates are not as skilled as they would be if they had gone to a school with higher-qualified instructors. This leads to education perpetuating a cycle of poverty. People that choose to work in the schools close to them do not adequately supply the school with enough teachers. The schools must then outsource their teachers from other areas. Susanna Loeb from the School of Education at Stanford did a study and found that teachers who are brought in from the suburbs are 10 times more likely to transfer out of the school after their initial year. The fact that the teachers from the suburbs leave appears to be an influential factor for schools hiring more teachers from that area. The lack of adequate education for children is part of what allows for the cycle of poverty to continue. The problem undergoing this is the lack of updating the knowledge of the staff. Schools have continued to conduct professional development the same way they have for decades. =Culture of poverty= Another theory for the perpetual cycle of poverty is that poor people have their own culture with a different set of values and beliefs that keep them trapped within that cycle generation to generation. This theory has been explored by Ruby K. Payne in her book A Framework for Understanding Poverty. In this book she explains how a social class system in the United States exists, where there is a wealthy upper class, a middle class, and the working poor class. These classes each have their own set of rules and values, which differ from each other. To understand the culture of poverty, Payne describes how these rules affect the poor and tend to keep them trapped in this continual cycle. Time is treated differently by the poor; they generally do not plan ahead but simply live in the moment, which keeps them from saving money that could help their children escape poverty. Payne emphasizes how important it is when working with the poor to understand their unique cultural differences so that one does not get frustrated but instead tries to work with them on their ideologies and help them to understand how they can help themselves and their children escape the cycle. One aspect of generational poverty is a learned helplessness that is passed from parents to children, a mentality that there is no way for one to get out of poverty and so in order to make the best of the situation one must enjoy what one can when one can. This leads to such habits as spending money immediately, often on unnecessary goods such as alcohol and cigarettes, thus teaching their children to do the same and trapping them in poverty. Another important point Payne makes is that leaving poverty is not as simple as acquiring money and moving into a higher class but also includes giving up certain relationships in exchange for achievement. A student's peers can have an influence on the child's level of achievement. Coming from a low-income household a child could be teased or expected to fall short academically. This can cause a student to feel discouraged and hold back when it comes to getting involved more with their education because they are scared to be teased if they fail. This helps to explain why the culture of poverty tends endure from generation to generation as most of the relationships the poor have are within that class.Payne, Ruby K. Framework for understanding poverty. Highlands, Tex: Aha! Process, 2005. The \\"culture of poverty\\" theory has been debated and critiqued by many people including Eleanor Burke Leacock (and others) in her book The Culture of Poverty: A Critique.Leacock, Eleanor B. (Ed.) The Culture of Poverty: A Critique. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1971. Leacock claims that people who use the term, \\"culture of poverty\\" only \\"contribute to the distorted characterizations of the poor.\\" In addition, Michael Hannan in an essayDugan, Dennis J., Leahy, William H. Perspectives on Poverty. New York: Praeger, 1973. argues that the \\"culture of poverty\\" is \\"essentially untestable.\\" This is due to many things including the highly subjective nature of poverty and issues concerning the universal act of classifying only some impoverished people as trapped in the culture. = Life shocks = 2004 research in New Zealand produced a report that showed that \\"life shocks\\" can be endured only to a limited extent, after which people are much more likely to be tipped into hardship. The researchers found very little differences in living standards for people who have endured up to 7 negative events in their lifetime. People who had 8 or more life shocks were dramatically more likely to live in poverty than those who had 0 to 7 life shocks. A few of the life shocks studied were: * Marriage (or similar) break-ups (divorce) * Forced sale of house * Unexpected and substantial drop in income * Eviction * Bankruptcy * Substantial financial loss * Redundancy (being laid off from a job) * Becoming a single parent * 3 months or more unemployed * Major damage to home * House burgled * Victim of violence * Incarceration * A non-custodial sentence (community service, or fines, but not imprisonment) * Illness lasting three weeks or more * Major injury or health problem * Unplanned pregnancy and birth of a child The study focused on just a few possible life shocks, but many others are likely as traumatic or more so. Chronic PTSD, complex PTSD, and depression sufferers could have innumerable causes for their mental illness, including those studied above. The study is subject to some criticism. =Tracking in education= History in the United States has shown that Americans saw education as the way to end the perpetual cycle of poverty. In the present, children from low to middle income households are at a disadvantage. They are twice as likely to be held back and more likely not to graduate from high school. Recent studies have shown that the cause for the disparity among academic achievement results from the school's structure where some students succeed from an added advantage and others fail as a result of lacking that advantage. Educational institutions with a learning disparity are causing education to be a sustaining factor for the cycle of poverty. One prominent example of this type of school structures is tracking, which is predominantly used to help organize a classroom so the variability of academic ability in classes is decreased. Students are tracked based on their ability level, generally based on a standardized test after which they are given different course requirements. Some people believe that tracking \\"enhances academic achievement and improves the self-concept of students by permitting them to progress at their own pace.\\" The negative side is that studies have shown that tracking decreases students' opportunity to learn. Tracking also has a disproportionate number of Latinos and African Americans that have low socioeconomic status in the lower learning tracks. Tracking separates social classes putting the poor and minority children in lower tracks where they receive second-rate education, and the students that are better off are placed in upper tracks where they have many opportunities for success. Studies have found that in addition to the higher tracks having more extensive curriculum, there is also a disparity among the teachers and instructional resources provided. There appears to be a race/class bias which results in intelligent children not receiving the skills or opportunities needed for success or social/economic mobility, thus continuing the cycle of poverty. There is an overall perception that American education is failing and research has done nothing to counter this statement, but instead has revealed the reality and severity of the issue of the existence of tracking and other structures that cause the cycle of poverty to continue. Theories and strategies for breaking the cycle Shiva Kumar ‚Äì The importance of MDGs in redefining what are the poverty drivers = General approaches = While many governmental officials are still trying to solve poverty, many states and localities are making an effort to break the cycle. Mayor Bloomberg of New York City has been advocating a plan where parents are paid up to $5,000 a year for meeting certain goals that will better their lives. This policy was modeled after a Mexican initiative that aims to help poor families make better decisions that will help them in the long-term and break cycle of poverty and dependence that have been known to last for generations. In addition, many states also have been making an attempt to help break the cycle. For example, a bill has been proposed in the California Assembly that \\"would establish an advisory Childhood Poverty Council to develop a plan to reduce child poverty in the state by half by 2017 and eliminate it by 2027\\".Billitteri, Thomas. \\"States and Localities. CQ Researcher 17.31 (2007): 738‚Äì39. Even when the plan has poverty reduction as the goal, a rise in child poverty might be the reality for many states as it was in Connecticut. States are attempting to not only decrease the number of people in the cycle of poverty, but to also adjust the stringent work requirements that resulted from Congress's welfare reform. The tougher work restrictions have upset many poverty advocates that believe the new regulations prevent individuals that are vulnerable or that lack skills from preparing for work. California Democratic Representative McDermott believes as a result of this and other effects of the new limitations, it has been harder for individuals to escape a life of poverty. In his book Children in Jeopardy: Can We Break the Cycle, Irving B. Harris discusses ways in which children can be helped to begin breaking the cycle of poverty. He stresses the importance of starting early and teaching children the importance of education from a very young age as well as making sure these children get the same educational opportunities as students who are richer. Family values such as nurturing children and encouraging them to do well in school need to be promoted as well as a non-authoritarian approach to parenting. Harris also discusses the importance of discouraging teenage pregnancy and finding ways in which to decrease this phenomenon so that when children are born they are planned and wanted and thus have a better chance at breaking the cycle of poverty.Harris, Irving B. Children in jeopardy can we break the cycle of poverty? New Haven: Yale Child Study Center, Distributed by Yale UP, 1996. It has been suggested by researchers like Lane Kenworthy that increasing welfare benefits and extending them to non-working families can help reduce poverty as other nations that have done so have had better results. The Harlem Children's Zone is working to end generational poverty within a 100-block section of Harlem using an approach that provides educational support and services for children and their families from birth through college. This approach has been recognized as a model by the Obama administration's anti-poverty program. = Two-generation poverty alleviation approach = A two-generation poverty alleviation approach focuses on the education, health and social services, and opportunities that parents and children desperately need to lift their families from the depths of the bondage of poverty to a stable and healthy state mentally, physically, and financially. A two-generation approach is a holistic plan for poverty alleviation and \\"is needed to help low-income parents and children improve their situation\\". Using a two-generation approach, parents are taught additional career skills, provided leadership training, and given access to job opportunities with higher wages. Children are given access to better educational programs, free preschool, free childcare, and the supplies they'll need to be successful in school. The family unit receives counseling for the current stressors of poverty as well as childhood trauma. All members of the household are given access to full healthcare benefits, food services at home and in school, and financial relief for their bills, clothing, and transportation in the short-term to relieve the basic needs stressors that prevent the family from taking the time to learn and grow. The preschool program Head Start believes that the only system that works for a preschool is one where the child as a whole is considered, which includes their health and their parents' ability to succeed. The two- generation poverty alleviation approach sees each member relieved of the basic needs stressors that plague their minds, ensures that they are physically and mentally healthy, provides them the opportunities to learn the skills needed for higher wage jobs, and gives them access to higher wage jobs without discrimination. Effects on children Children are most at the mercy of the cycle of poverty. Because a child is dependent on his or her guardian(s), if a child's guardian is in poverty, then they will be also. It is almost impossible for a child to pull him or herself out of the cycle due to age, lack of experience, lack of a job, etc. Because children are at such a young and impressionable age, the scars they gain from experiencing poverty early in life inevitably carry on into their adult life. \\"Childhood lays the foundations for adult abilities, interests, and motivation.\\" Therefore, if they learn certain poverty-related behaviors in childhood, the behaviors are more likely to perpetuate. Studies have shown that household structure sometimes has a connection to childhood poverty. Most studies on the subject also show that the children that are in poverty tend to come from single- parent households (most often matriarchal). In 1997, nearly 8.5 million (57%) poor children in the US came from single-parent households. With the rate of divorce increasing and the number of children born out of wedlock increasing, the number of children that are born into or fall into single-parent households is also increasing. However, this does not mean that the child/children will be impoverished because of it. According to Ashworth, Hill, & Walker (2004), both urban and rural poor children are more likely to be isolated from the nonpoor in schools, neighborhoods, and their communities. Human nature is to have relationships with others but when a child is isolated due to their socioeconomic status, it's hard to overcome that when the status doesn't improve. Therefore, poor children also have more tense relationships which sometimes results in abnormal behavior, acting out, or other unexplained behaviors. There have been programs developed to specifically address the needs of poor children. Francis Marion University's Center of Excellence to Prepare Teachers of Children of Poverty has a number of initiatives devoted to equipping teachers to be more effective in raising the achievement of children of poverty. Located in South Carolina, the Center provides direct teacher training as well as facilitates research in the area of poverty and scholastic achievement. A resource that is out there to try and help communities undergoing poverty are places like Head Start. Head Start is a program for low income families that provides early childhood education as well as parent involvement. Results show that attending these programs increases children's academic outcomes. The problem is that in high poverty areas this is supposed to be a helpful resource, but they start to hold lower quality due to lack of funds to keep places updated. Oftentimes the communities in which impoverished children grow up in are crime ridden areas, examples of these areas are Harlem and the Bronx. These areas have effects on children as they are often exposed to crime and maltreatment at a young age, which is proven to reduce a child's ability to learn by up to 5%.Walsh, Nancy. \\"Child Abuse Affects Teen Learning.\\" MedPage Today. MedPage Today, 06 Dec. 2010. Web. 24 Nov. 2012. Oftentimes these youth get caught up in the crime that goes on all around them, this involvement only worsens the effects of the cycle as they are often incarcerated or killed in many types of gang violence.Sandoval, Edgar, Bob Kappstatter, and Rocco Parascandola. Developing world In the developing world, many factors can contribute to a poverty trap, including: limited access to credit and capital markets, extreme environmental degradation (which depletes agricultural production potential), corrupt governance, capital flight, poor education systems, disease ecology, lack of public health care, war and poor infrastructure.Bonds, M.H., D.C. Keenan, P. Rohani, and J. D. Sachs. 2010. \\"Poverty trap formed by the ecology of infectious diseases,\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 277:1185‚Äì92. Jeffrey Sachs, in his book The End of Poverty, discusses the poverty trap and prescribes a set of policy initiatives intended to end the trap. He recommends that aid agencies behave as venture capitalists funding start-up companies. Venture capitalists, once they choose to invest in a venture, do not give only half or a third of the amount they feel the venture needs in order to become profitable; if they did, their money would be wasted. If all goes as planned, the venture will eventually become profitable and the venture capitalist will experience an adequate rate of return on investment. Likewise, Sachs proposes, developed countries cannot give only a fraction of what is needed in aid and expect to reverse the poverty trap in Africa. Just like any other start-up, developing nations absolutely must receive the amount of aid necessary (and promised at the G-8 Summit in 2005Collier, Paul et al. \\"Flight Capital as a Portfolio Choice. \\" Development Research Group, World Bank.) for them to begin to reverse the poverty trap. The problem is that unlike start-ups, which simply go bankrupt if they fail to receive funding, in Africa people continue to die at a high rate due in large part to lack of sufficient aid. Sachs points out that the extreme poor lack six major kinds of capital: human capital, business capital, infrastructure, natural capital, public institutional capital, and knowledge capital.Sachs, Jeffrey D. The End of Poverty. Penguin Books, 2006. p. 244 He then details the poverty trap: > The poor start with a very low level of capital per person, and then find > themselves trapped in poverty because the ratio of capital per person > actually falls from generation to generation. The amount of capital per > person declines when the population is growing faster than capital is being > accumulated ... The question for growth in per capita income is whether the > net capital accumulation is large enough to keep up with population growth. Sachs argues that sufficient foreign aid can make up for the lack of capital in poor countries, maintaining that, \\"If the foreign assistance is substantial enough, and lasts long enough, the capital stock rises sufficiently to lift households above subsistence.\\" Sachs believes the public sector should focus mainly on investments in human capital (health, education, nutrition), infrastructure (roads, power, water and sanitation, environmental conservation), natural capital (conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems), public institutional capital (a well-run public administration, judicial system, police force), and parts of knowledge capital (scientific research for health, energy, agriculture, climate, ecology).Sachs, Jeffrey D. The End of Poverty. Penguin Books, 2006. p. 252 Sachs leaves business capital investments to the private sector, which he claims would more efficiently use funding to develop the profitable enterprises necessary to sustain growth. In this sense, Sachs views public institutions as useful in providing the public goods necessary to begin the Rostovian take-off model, but maintains that private goods are more efficiently produced and distributed by private enterprise.Sachs, Jeffrey D. The End of Poverty. Penguin Books, 2006. p. (?) This is a widespread view in neoclassical economics. Several other forms of poverty traps are discussed in the literature,Paul Collier, The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It, Oxford University Press, 2007; Stephen C. Smith, Ending Global Poverty, Palgrave Macmillan 2005; Partha Dasgupta, An Inquiry into Well-being and Destitution, Oxford UP, 1995. including nations being landlocked with bad neighbors; a vicious cycle of violent conflict; subsistence traps in which farmers wait for middlemen before they specialize but middlemen wait for a region to specialize first; working capital traps in which petty sellers have inventories too sparse to earn enough money to get a bigger inventory; low skill traps in which workers wait for jobs using special skill but firms wait for workers to get such skills; nutritional traps in which individuals are too malnourished to work, yet too poor to afford sustainable food; and behavioral traps in which individuals cannot differentiate between temptation and non- temptation goods, and therefore cannot invest in the non-temptation goods which could help them begin to escape poverty.

Berry joined Manchester United from Birmingham City in 1951. Despite his diminutive stature, he was a natural right winger with technique and pace. Career Berry (front row, far left) in a Manchester United team photo in 1957 Berry was born in Aldershot in Hampshire, the son of Mary (n√©e O'Connor) and Reginald Berry, a Sergeant in the Royal Horse Artillery; he lived with his family on Crimea Road. As a boy, he played football for St Joseph's School in Aldershot and Aldershot YMCA, and on leaving school he worked as a projectionist for a local cinema. He tried to sign for Aldershot F.C. but was told he was too short. During service with the Royal Artillery in the Second World War, he was brought to the attention of Birmingham City and signed as a professional at St Andrews in 1944. In 1951, Matt Busby paid Birmingham City ¬£25,000 to bring Berry to Manchester United.Obituary for Johnny Berry - The Independent 23 September 1994 Berry played 277 matches for Manchester United, scoring 44 goals along the way, including helping Manchester United win three league titles. He played regularly for the first six seasons, before losing his place in the starting XI to youngster Kenny Morgans. Injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster brought his footballing career to an end at the age of 31. When he woke up he was totally unaware of the plane crash, his injuries having caused mild amnesia. A month after he regained consciousness, he found out about the crash from seeing a newspaper. He spent two months in hospital with a fractured skull, a broken jaw, a broken elbow, a broken pelvis, and a broken leg. All of his teeth had to be removed while treating his jaw injuries. He only found out which of his teammates had been killed some time after he returned to England. When still in hospital, he would complain to manager Matt Busby that his teammate Tommy Taylor was a poor friend for not visiting him, unaware that Taylor had been killed. Doctors treating Berry felt that he was not well enough to be told that any of his colleagues had died at the time. Berry was also capped four times by England while playing for Manchester United, his chances of regular international action inevitably restricted by the form of Stanley Matthews and Tom Finney on the wing. His first job after retiring from football was with Massey Ferguson at Trafford Park, but in 1960 he was asked to leave the Manchester United-owned house to accommodate new signing Maurice Setters, and he left the Manchester area to return to Aldershot. He later ran a sports business with his younger brother Peter in Cove, a village near Aldershot, until the 1980s. Peter was also a professional footballer, most notably with Crystal Palace. They also ran the sports shop Berry Brothers at Queensmead in Farnbororugh. Johnny Berry spent the final years of his working life as a storeman in a local television warehouse.

The term(s) are used in contrast to Shiry≈ç, which refers to the spirit of those who are already deceased. Summary The popular belief that the human spirit (or soul) can escape from the body has been around since early times, with eyewitness accounts and experiences (hauntings, possessions, out-of-body experience) reported in anecdotal and fictional writings. of the living are said to inflict upon the subject or subjects of their vengeance by means of transforming into their ikiry≈ç form. It is believed that if a sufficient grudge is held, all or part of the perpetrator's soul leaves the body, appearing in front of the victim to harm or curse them, a concept not so dissimilar from the evil eye. The ikiry≈ç has even made its way into Buddhist scriptures, where they are described as \\"living spirits\\" who, if angered, might bring about curses, even just before their death. Possession is another means by which the Ikiry≈ç are commonly believed to be capable of inflicting harm, the possessed person thought to be unaware of this process. However, according to mythology, the ikiry≈ç does not necessarily act out of spite or vengefulness, and stories are told of the ikiry≈ç who bears no grudge, or poses no real threat. In recorded examples, the spirit sometimes takes possession of another person's body for motives other than vengeance, such as love and infatuation (for example the Matsut≈çya ghost below). A person's ikiry≈ç may also leave the body (often very shortly before death) to manifest its presence around loved ones, friends and/or acquaintances. Classical literature In classical literature, The Tale of Genji (ca. 1000) describes the \\"well known\\" episode of the ikisudama (the more archaic term for ikiry≈ç) that emerged from Genji's lover Lady Rokujo, and tormented Genji's pregnant wife Aoi no Ue, resulting in her death after childbirth. This spirit is also portrayed in Aoi no Ue, the Noh play adaptation of the same story. After her death, Lady Rokujo became an onry≈ç and went on to torment those who would later become Genji's consorts, Murasaki and . In the Heian period, a human soul leaving a body and drifting away is described by the old verb \\"akugaru\\" meaning \\"departure\\". In The Tale of Genji, the mentally troubled Kashiwagi fears that his soul may be found wandering (akugaru), and requests that last rites are performed on his body to stop his soul from escaping if this should happen. and by Murakami.Another example of this term occurs in the verse by the poet Izumi Shikibu which depicts the author's soul as a wandering firefly: \\"While I am rapt in thought, / The fireflies of the marsh would seem to be / My soul, caught up and wandering / Forth out of me.\\" (Gosh≈´i Wakash≈´, Tale 20). Konjaku Monogatarish≈´ contains the tale of \\"How the Ikiryo Spirit of Omi Province Came and Killed a Man of the Capital.\\" In the tale, a commoner encounters a noblewoman and guides her to the house of a certain in the capital. Little did the guide know that he was guiding the ikiry≈ç of a woman to her neglecting husband. Upon reaching the house the lady vanishes, though the gates remain shut. Wailing noises are heard inside the house. The following morning, the guide learns that the master of the house had complained the ikiry≈ç of his former wife was present and causing him illness, shortly after which he died. The guide later seeks out the lady's house in ≈åmi Province. There a woman speaks to him through blinds, acknowledging the man's services that day, and showers him with gifts of silk cloth.: subchapter The ikiry≈ç can also possess the object of its infatuation, who is neither rival nor enemy. The \\"Matsut≈çya y≈´rei\\",The tale is recorded in the essay collection, a tale allegedly based on events that occurred during Ky≈çh≈ç 14 or 15 (1729‚Äì30), a Kyoto merchant named had a teenaged son named Matsunosuke possessed by the spirit of two women who loved him, and who tormented the boy's conscience. On occasion, he would be suspended in mid-air, engaging in conversation as if the girls were present before his eyes, the ikiry≈ç's words being spoken through the boy's lips. Finally the family sought help from a renowned priest named Z≈çkai. The priest successfully exorcised the boy and cured his condition, but rumors had already spread regarding the incident. \\"Onna no M≈çnen Mayoiaruku Koto\\" (Â•≥„ÅÆÂ¶ÑÂøµËø∑„Å≤Ê≠©„Åè‰∫ã) from the \\"Sorori Monogatari\\" (ÊõæÂëÇÂà©Áâ©Ë™û) The horror story (kaidan) collection (published Kanbun 3, or 1663) includes a tale of a woman whose ikiry≈ç assumed the shape of her severed head.cf. the y≈çkai monster known as nukekubi. One night, a man traveling towards Kyoto arrives at place called Sawaya in Kita- no-sh≈ç, Echizen Province (now Fukui City), where he mistakedly thinks he saw a chicken fly from the base of a nearby stone tower on to the road. The imagined chicken turns out to be (or has transformed into) a lively severed head of a woman. When the face grins at him, he attacks with a sword, and chases it to a home in the capital of the province. Inside the house, the housewife awakes from a nightmare being chased by a man brandishing a blade. The wandering head was, according to the title, the woman's , or her wayward thoughts and obsessions. The woman later turns Buddhist nun to repent for her sins.Original source story title is Folk legends =Regional near-death spirits= Sightings of ikiry≈ç belonging to those whose deaths are imminent have been recorded from all over Japan. Stories abound of spirits that materialize (or otherwise manifest their presence) to someone dear to them, such as immediate family. The recipient of the visit experiencing a metaphysical foreshadowing of this person's death, before any tangible news of bereavement arrives. Many of the local terms for the ikiry≈ç were collected by Kunio Yanagita and his school of folklorists.While terms such as tobi-damashi or omokage, Akita, or shininb≈ç are used in the Ishikawa Prefecture in isolated cases, these terms are not frequently used anywhere elsewhere. In the tradition of the Nishitsugaru District, Aomori Prefecture, the souls of the person/s on the brink of death are called amabito, and believed to depart from the body and walk around, sometimes making noises like that of the door sliding open. According to Yanagita, is the equivalent term to the Senboku District, Akita region. Yanagita defines this as the ability of certain persons to traverse the world in their Ikir»≥o form. Such individuals are purported to have voluntary control of this ability, in contrast to those who are only temporarily capable of tapping into such a state as a precursor to their death. In the Kazuno District in Akita Prefecture, a soul that pays visit to acquaintances is called an , and assumes the form of a living human, that is to say, it has feet and make pitter-patter noises, unlike the stereotypical Japanese ghost that have no legs or feet. Yanagita in T≈çno monogatari sh≈´i reported that in the T≈çno Region, Iwate Prefecture, \\"the thoughts of the dead or the living coalesce into a walking shape, and appear to the human eye as an illusion is termed an omaku in this region.\\" An example being a beautiful girl aged 16 or 17, critically ill with a case of (Typhoid fever or a similar disease). She was seen wandering around the construction site of the K≈çganji temple rebuild project in , the days before her death., citing Yanagita, T≈çno Monogatari In Kashima District, Ishikawa on the Noto Peninsula, a folklorist recorded belief in the , said to appear 2 or 3 days before someone's death, which was seen passing through on its visits to danna-dera (The family temple, also called bodaiji). The temple was believed to be the soul's final resting grounds, where one finds a place amongst their ancestors., cited by Soul flames There are cases where the wandering ikiry≈ç appear as a floating \\"soul flame\\", known in Japan as the hitodama or hidama.A hidama, the Japanese equivalent to the will-o'-the-wisp (or generically \\"atmospheric ghost lights\\") However, a \\"soul flame\\" from a person who is near death is not considered unusual, with the traditional conception among Japanese being that the soul escapes the body within a short phase (several days) either before or after death. Therefore, pre-death soul flames may not be treated as cases of ikiry≈ç in works on the subject of ghosts, but filed under chapters on the hitodama phenomenon.) describes cases of floating balloon-like objects of yellow color (iridescent colored, according to Konno) an omen of death. The locals in the Shimokita District, Aomori refer to the object as , the same term in common usage by locals in Komena hamlet, in the town of ≈åhata. On the day after a sighting of one heading towards the mountains (Mount Osore) on April 2, 1963, a boy died in the hospital from injuries he sustained falling off a bridge while double-riding a bicycle. One case of a near-death hitodama deemed 'suitable for discussion' under the topic of ikiry≈ç by a folklorist closely resembled the aforementioned tale of the woman's head in the \\"Sorori Monogatari\\", namely, that the subject who witnessed the soul's apparition pursued it ruthlessly, until he discovered the owner of the soul, who claimed to have seen the entire experience of being chased during a dream. The subject worked at the town office of T≈çno, Iwate, and one night, he reported seeing an hidama emerge from a stable and into the house's entrance where it was 'flying around'. He claimed to have chased it with a broom, and trapped it beneath a washbasin. A while after, he was rushed out to see his sick uncle on the brink of death, but he made sure to release the fireball from its trapping. He soon learned that his uncle had only just died, but his uncle came back to life again, enough so to accuse the nephew of chasing him with a broom and capturing him.), citing T≈çno monogatari Similarly, the folklore archives of Umedoi, Mie Prefecture (now part of Inabe) tells a tale about a band of men who, late in the night, spotted and chased a fireball into a sake warehouse, waking a maid who was asleep inside.

He worked with Louis Sullivan and later with William Gray Purcell as a partner in the firm Purcell & Elmslie. Career Elmslie began his apprenticeship in the office of William LeBaron Jenney, who originated the steel frame skeleton used in modern building construction. In 1887, Elmslie joined Frank Lloyd Wright and George Maher in the office of Joseph Lyman Silsbee, a Western New York based architect who had moved to Chicago. After Wright left to go to work for Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan in 1887, he recommended Elmslie to Sullivan. In 1888, Elsmlie joined Wright at Adler & Sullivan, which led to a 20-year association between Elmslie and Sullivan. Wright and Elmslie shared an office next to Sullivan's. Elmslie was Sullivan‚Äôs chief draftsman and ornamental designer. He detailed the ornamentation for Sullivan‚Äôs Wainwright Building in St. Louis, the Schlesinger & Mayer Department store in Chicago and the National Farmers Bank in Owatonna, Minnesota. =Purcell & Elmslie= The architectural practice most widely known as Purcell & Elmslie consisted of three partnerships. The first, Purcell & Feick, was created at Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1907 between Purcell and his Cornell School of Architecture classmate, George Feick, Jr. George Elmslie and Purcell had been friends since 1903, when Purcell worked for a short while in the office of Louis Sullivan, and Elmslie was an informal influence in the work of Purcell & Feick. In 1909, Elmslie joined the office in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the name of the firm changed to Purcell, Feick, & Elmslie in 1910. Feick left the partnership in 1912, and the name of the practice became Purcell & Elmslie until being dissolved in 1921. Over the course of the partnership, Purcell & Elmslie became one of the most commissioned firms among the Prairie School architects, second only to Frank Lloyd Wright. Following the dissolution of his partnership with Purcell, Elmslie worked occasionally with various other architects, including Lawrence A. Fournier, William S. Hutton, Hermann V. von Holst, William Eugene Drummond, and William L. Steele, and produced a number of banks, train stations, commercial, and institutional buildings during the 1920s and 1930s. In private practice Elmslie concentrated primarily on commercial designs. As his commission work decreased, he sought work with William S. Hutton and helped him with the design of the Washington Irving, the Oliver Morton and the Thomas Edison Schools in Hammond, Indiana, and also the design of Thornton Township High School in Calumet City, Illinois. Elmslie was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1947. Gallery File:OwatonnaBank.JPGNational Farmers Bank in Owatonna, Minnesota (1908) File:Harold-c-bradley-house.jpgHarold C.

The apparent reason for this was due to his immigration status in 1885, when he joined his father John Elmslie in Chicago from his native Scotland. Had Elmslie divulged his true age, he would have been ineligible to enter the United States as a dependent family member. Elmslie died on April 23, 1952 and is interred at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.

Born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, Quixall started his career with Sheffield Wednesday, signing as an amateur in 1948 and turning professional in 1950. He made his debut in February 1951 as a 17-year-old centre forward and went on to play almost 250 League games, scoring 66 League and Cup goals with the Owls. He was in his prime with Sheffield Wednesday, and gained much media attention, becoming the Golden Boy of British football. Quixall joined Manchester United in September 1958 for a then British record fee of ¬£45,000, one of Matt Busby's key recruits in building a new team in the aftermath of the Munich air disaster, which had killed eight players and ended the careers of two others on 6 February that year. After seven games without a win for United, Quixall eventually helped the team go on a run of only two losses in 23 matches to end the season as runners-up in the First Division. Quixall's only medal with the club was the 1963 FA Cup. Altogether, he scored 56 goals in 184 games for the Red Devils. Along with Johnny Giles and David Herd, he was dropped after Everton thrashed United 4‚Äì0 in the 1963 FA Charity Shield. He rarely featured in the 1963‚Äì64 season, last appearing for United on Boxing Day 1963. He left the club at the end of the season, moving to Oldham Athletic for ¬£7,000, spending two years at Boundary Park before finishing his professional career at Stockport County in 1967. Quixall was capped five times for England in 1954 and 1955.

It is one of the two major connections between Montreal and Quebec City, the other being Autoroute 20 on the south shore of the St. Lawrence. Autoroute 40 is currently long. Between the Ontario‚ÄìQuebec boundary and the interchange with Autoroute 25, the route is signed as part of the Trans-Canada Highway.  Route description  The western terminus of Autoroute 40 is located at the Ontario‚ÄìQuebec border, where it continues as Highway 417 towards Ottawa; the eastern terminus is in Boischatel, where it transitions into Route 138 at the end of the freeway. The portion of Autoroute 40 from the Ontario border to Autoroute 25 is part of the Trans-Canada Highway. The Metropolitan Autoroute portion in Montreal is the busiest highway in Quebec, the busiest section of the Trans-Canada Highway, as well as the second busiest highway section overall in Canada after Highway 401 in Toronto.  History  leftTwo sections of Autoroute 40 were not part of the original plans: The original intention was to bypass Trois-Rivi√®res to the north (the existing A-40 through downtown would have been Autoroute 755 and the concurrency with Autoroute 55 would have been simply A-55). In addition, a different route was originally planned around Sainte-Foy (now in the west end of Quebec City) south of Jean Lesage International Airport (the existing segment of Autoroute 40 between St-Augustin and Autoroute 73 would have been the western end of Autoroute 440, thus explaining the exit numbering starting at 12). While the right-of-ways of both bypasses still exist and may still be developed in the future as congestion increases, there are no immediate plans to renew construction. Some discussion of eastward extensions of A-40 into the Charlevoix region and beyond have taken place, most likely to Route 360 in Beaupr√© or even as far as Route 362 in La Malbaie since tourism in the region is increasing; however, that appears unlikely in the short term. A stretch of the highway in Pointe-Claire, from roughly St. John's Boulevard, near Fairview Pointe-Claire Shopping Centre, to the turnaround loop, Senneville Road was used during the 1976 Summer Olympics for the men's road team time trial cycling race.1976 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. pp. 156-8. left In 1997, the highway (apart from the portion served by the Metropolitan Autoroute) was renamed Autoroute F√©lix-Leclerc after the late Quebec artist and political activist F√©lix Leclerc. Prior to 1997, Autoroute 40 east of Montreal had four different names, the first section was named Autoroute de la Rive-Nord (North Shore Autoroute) between Montr√©al and Saint-Augustin-de- Desmaures (km 87 to 196, 209 to 296). A segment in Trois-Rivi√®res east of Autoroute 55 that was named Autoroute de Francheville (Francheville Autoroute) (km 196 to 207). Between Saint-Augustin and Autoroute 73 in Quebec City (km 296 to 307) it was called Autoroute Charest. Finally, between the junction of Autoroute 73 and Autoroute 573 and its eastern end at Route 138 it was known as Autoroute de la Capitale, a name that is still commonly used by Quebec City residents.

Definition  Recall that a subset of a TVS is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.  Characterizations  * A separable Fr√©chet space is a Montel space if and only if each weak-* convergent sequence in its continuous dual converges is strongly convergent.  Sufficient conditions  * A closed vector subspace of a semi-Montel space is again a semi-Montel space. * The locally convex direct sum of any family of semi-Montel spaces is again a semi-Montel space. * The inverse limit of an inverse system consisting of semi-Montel spaces is again a semi-Montel space. * The Cartesian product of any family of semi-Montel spaces (resp. Montel spaces) is again a semi-Montel space (resp. a Montel space). * The strong dual of a Montel space is Montel. * A barrelled quasi-complete nuclear space is a Montel space. * Every product and locally convex direct sum of a family of Montel spaces is a Montel space. * The strict inductive limit of a sequence of Montel spaces is a Montel space. * In contrast, closed subspaces and separated quotients of Montel spaces are in general not even reflexive. * Every Fr√©chet Schwartz space is a Montel space.  Properties  * No infinite-dimensional Banach space is a Montel space, * This is because a Banach space cannot satisfy the Heine‚ÄìBorel property: the closed unit ball is closed and bounded, but not compact. * Montel spaces are paracompact and normal. * Semi-Montel spaces are quasi-complete. * Semi-Montel spaces are semi-reflexive and Montel spaces are reflexive. * Fr√©chet Montel spaces are separable and have a bornological strong dual. * A metrizable Montel space is separable.  Examples  In classical complex analysis, Montel's theorem asserts that the space of holomorphic functions on an open connected subset of the complex numbers has this property. Many Montel spaces of contemporary interest arise as spaces of test functions for a space of distributions. The space of smooth functions on an open set Œ© in is a Montel space equipped with the topology induced by the family of seminorms :\\\\f\\\\_{K,n} = \\\\sup_{\\\\alpha\\\\le n}\\\\sup_{x\\\\in K}\\\\left\\\\partial^\\\\alpha f(x)\\\\right for and ranges over compact subsets of Œ©, and Œ± is a multi-index.

The company operates two business units and holds a 50% interest in a major joint venture with INEOS, called INEOS NOVA. Company history In 1954, the Alberta legislature under Ernest Manning passed the Alberta Gas Trunk Line Company Act, creating the Alberta Gas Trunk Line Company (AGTL) Crown Corporation, with a monopoly on natural gas transportation (pipelines) within the province. Construction began in 1956 and gas began flowing in 1957. In the 1970s, AGTL expanded into the chemicals industry. The company was privatized in 1961 and was renamed NOVA Corporation in 1980, and by 1989 was considered a \\"petrochemical and pipeline giant.\\" In the 1980s, NOVA had controlling ownership of Calgary-based Husky Oil. NOVA sold the last of its stake in Husky in 1991. In 1998, NOVA Corporation split in two, with its pipeline business (with $11 billion in annual sales) merging with TransCanada Pipelines and its chemicals business ($2.4 billion sales) becoming a publicly traded company, NOVA Chemicals. NOVA Chemicals history. Retrieved online 2011-09-28 Shortly after the split, then-CEO Jeffrey Lipton moved NOVA Chemicals' head office from Calgary to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While this move was made in order to be closer to US customers, the benefits of the move never materialized. It was also seen as a snub to the province of Alberta, as Premier Ed Stelmach refused to grant NOVA Chemicals a bailout in 2009 due to the financial meltdown and recession, as well as the company's heavy debt load. On July 6, 2009, the International Petroleum Investment Company (since 2016 IPIC merged with Mubadala), which is wholly owned by the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, completed the 100% purchase of NOVA Chemicals, and transferred its place of incorporation to the Province of New Brunswick. In the United States, NOVA Chemicals has focused recent expansion in the Gulf Coast area. This includes acquiring an olefins plant that produces roughly 1.95 billion pounds of ethylene annually in Geismar, Louisiana, which was purchased from Williams Partners.

The hulls of the Avenger-class ships are constructed of wood with an external coat of fiberglass. Patriot was laid down on 31 March 1987 by Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin; launched on 15 May 1990; and commissioned on 13 December 1991 in Charleston, South Carolina. Commander Michael J. O'Moore, a native of Brooklyn, New York, was the commissioning Commanding Officer. Patriot was originally homeported at NS Charleston until 1993, when she transferred to NS Ingleside, Texas.  History  In 1994 Patriot was called to serve in the Pacific, and since then has served as one of four forward-deployed MCMs in 7th Fleet's Amphibious Ready Group. Patriot is operationally assigned to MCMDiv 11, CTF 76, ComSeventhFlt, CinCPacFlt, and USCinCPac. Her administrative chain of command is CoMCMDiv 11, CoMCMRon 1, CoMineWarCom (NAS Corpus Christi, TX) recently merged with Naval Anti- Submarine Warfare Command into NMAWC (Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command), and ComNavSurfLant. Although Patriot was permanently assigned to Sasebo, Japan, her crew served on a rotational basis from Ingleside, Texas. Each rotation lasted approximately 6 months. In 1996 the crew assignments were changed to permanent overseas assignments. Patriot and her sister ship Guardian were scheduled for a port visit to Hong Kong in the first week of August 1997. As preparations were completed, the Navy hierarchy realized that it would be the first US Navy port visit to the island after the handover to PRC control on 01 July 1997. Plans were quickly completed for USS Blue Ridge (LCC 19) to lead the port visit, and hold receptions for military and diplomatic dignitaries. Patriot and Guardian accompanied the flagship pierside.https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/10/2002112785/-1/-1/1/AH199711.pdf In March 2003 the major event was TSTA3/FEP. This Tailored Ship's Training Availability (TSTA3)/ Final Exercise Problem (FEP) initially designed to be a training assist visit to assess readiness, was turned into a graded scenario to prove her battle readiness. This advanced stage of training is designed to improve ships operations and give Patriot an opportunity to prove she is ready to perform her primary and secondary missions with utmost efficiency and skill. Patriot executed her deployment phase during the 2003 calendar year. Along with conducting MINEX, she participated in Exercise Foal Eagle 2003, a combined naval exercise with the Republic of Korea. Patriot successfully accomplished 100 percent mine-warfare tasking during the integrated exercise. Patriot conducted a WESTPAC Deployment during the months of May and June conducting port visits in Okinawa, Fukuoka, JA, Pusan, ROK, Inchon, ROK, and Kagoshima, JA. Patriot also took part in the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War with a port visit to Pusan, South Korea. Patriot routinely participates in a combined Mine Warfare training exercises with the Japanese Maritime Self- Defense Force as part of an annual MINEX and EODEX. MINEX/EODEX is a joint mine countermeasures (MCM) exercise designed to foster US Navy and Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) interoperability through the use of the MCM Triad, surface MCM (SMCM) air MCM (AMCM) and Explosive Ordnance disposal (EOD) teams. In 2005, Patriot conducted a Selected Maintenance Availability during which the ship was refitted with the most recent equipment upgrades and shipboard alterations. The maintenance period allowed the ship to re-train personnel and in preparations for the ship's Basic Training Phase and Interdeployment Training Cycle. On 16 February 2007, Patriot was awarded the 2006 Battle \\"E\\" award. In late November 2007, Patriot and sister minesweeper sought refueling and refuge from an approaching storm in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour, but were denied entry without explanation by the People's Republic of China. Both ships were eventually refueled at sea and returned safely to their home ports in Japan. In June 2011, six crew members were given nonjudicial punishment and recommended for discharge from the Navy. The discipline was the result of a hazing incident which took place during the preceding Memorial Day weekend.Fuentes, Gidget, \\"6 mine ship sailors get NJP in hazing incident\\", Military Times, 3 June 2011.

He promoted the expansion of Santa Cruz as a beach resort city. The seaside resort he established in 1904 remains today as the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Life Fred Swanton was born April 11, 1862 in Brooklyn, New York. His father was Albion Paris Swanton (1826‚Äì1911) who traveled to California in 1864, and was then followed by his wife Emily (Parshley) Swanton with Fred in 1866. After living briefly in Pescadero, California they settled in Santa Cruz, California in 1867. Swanton attended public schools and then graduated from Heald Business College in 1881. Swanton House Hotel in 1886 He worked as a bookkeeper at various lumber companies in California until 1883, when he and his mother traveled east to visit relatives. He returned with the patent license for the telephone, which he sold through most of California. On December 25, 1884 he married Stanley Hall in Santa Cruz. He operated a hotel called the Swanton House with his father and ran Knight's Opera House theater. The hotel was the tallest building in the city when it was built. It burned down on May 30, 1887, and he started a livery business called Bonner Stables, and then a store called the Palace of Pharmacy, and briefly owned a billboard business. In October 1889 he sold those businesses, and with Dr. H. H. Clark started the first electric company in the area. He developed the Santa Cruz Electric Railway which ran cars from the beach to Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz-Capitola Railroad to the new resort of Capitola, California to the south. In 1900 he invested in the Klondike Gold Rush, but by then the profits had been made. He also dabbled in oil fields and a chromite mine. \\"Coney Island of the west\\" Since 1865 the first of several bath houses operated on the Santa Cruz beach, and in 1868 a small boardwalk was built. Swanton envisioned developing the area into a resort similar to Atlantic City, New Jersey or Coney Island near his native Brooklyn. In October 1903 he held a meeting at the courthouse and predicted shares in his enterprise would return up to 25%. On October 29, 1903 the Santa Cruz Beach, Cottage, and Tent City Corporation was formed, and over US$100,000 was raised. Swanson was Director-General (although personally invested only $250). He traveled throughout the state selling shares, eventually raising $1.5million. Existing bath houses were purchased with stock shares, and a tent city was constructed on land leased from the Southern Pacific Railway. In April 1904 the city granted an exclusive franchise for the beach to the company. Although some residents protested because the city had paid for many improvements such as extending roads, mayor David C. Clark (supported by Swanton in his election campaign) broke a tie in the city council to award the contract. The 1904 Neptune Casino with horses and an electric trolley In the summer of 1904 the Neptune Casino (named after one of the original bath houses) was built, designed by architect Edward L. Van Cleeck. The Casino had a style similar to the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, England (the New Brighton State Beach lies a few miles to the south). The two story building with of beach front, was painted bright colors, and included dining rooms, a ballroom, and theater. A third floor rotunda was used as an observatory with views of the ocean. A \\"pleasure pier\\" long built over intake pipes for the baths (called the Plunge) was lit by electric lights. An opening ceremony was held June 11, 1904. After a profitable first year, the pier was extended in 1905, and Swanton planned further expansion. The Neptune Casino survived the April 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but burned down on June 22, 1906 from a kitchen fire. A large tent was erected and the Republican Party of California held their convention there in the summer. Swanton sold his electric company and trolley business to free up capital, and again raised more money to rebuild. Architect William Henry Weeks was hired to design an even larger complex which opened by June 15, 1907. In 1908, the first \\"thrill ride\\" opened, a miniature railway designed by LaMarcus Adna Thompson. In 1911, a carousel commissioned from Charles I. D. Looff was installed with an 1894 band organ from Andreas Ruth & Sohn. Swanton developed the Casa Del Rey Hotel across the street from the Casino in 1911. By 1912, a business downturn caused by the Panic of 1910‚Äì1911 wiped out the original stockholders. For the third time Swanton convinced investors to raise funds for the enterprise. By 1915 the Santa Cruz Seaside Company took over with Swanton again becoming an investor. Show business and politics Swanton tried to convince Hollywood movie producers to film in Santa Cruz. The silent film A Romance of the Redwoods was filmed in the area by Cecil B. DeMille. Edward Ferguson and W.D. Dalton (under the name \\"Fer Dal\\") and Theodore Wharton established studios briefly, but interest waned during World War I. In 1914 Swanton acted as agent of actress ZaSu Pitts, and staged a benefit performance at the Opera House to finance the start of her film career. He became so well known the city was sometimes called Swanticruz or Swanta Cruz. He became president of the Combined Amusement Company to build exhibits for the amusement park called the Zone at the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco. In 1924 he obtained the Miss America franchise for the state and started the Miss California beauty pageant, which was held in Santa Cruz until 1985. The first \\"Miss Santa Cruz\\", Fay Lanphier won the first two contests and became Miss America in 1925. Swanton was elected mayor of Santa Cruz on July 4, 1927, and was reelected for two more terms until 1933, when Roy Hammond took the office. Prohibition reduced profits, and the Neptune Casino had its name changed to \\"Cocoanut Grove\\". Business declined and his plans for real estate development fell through during the Great Depression. Death Swanton died September 3, 1940, almost bankrupt. He was described as a cross between P. T. Barnum and California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge, or the \\"P. T. Barnum of Santa Cruz\\". Legacy The resort is still owned by the private Santa Cruz Seaside Company. The amusement park is known as the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, which is a California Historical Landmark. and National Historic Landmark. The community of Swanton and Swanton Road, to the north of Santa Cruz were named after him, site of the Swanton Pacific Ranch where his hydro-electric power generators were built. The site of his failed subdivision (at his namesake Swanton Boulevard, ) is now Natural Bridges State Beach, originally called Swanton Beach State Park.

The band's line-up consists of Roddy Woomble (lead vocals), Rod Jones (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Newton (drums), Andrew Mitchell (bass), and Luciano Rossi (keyboards). To date, Idlewild have released nine full-length studio albums. Initially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. However, it developed over time from an edgy and angular sound (as heard in their early material‚Äîonce described by the NME as \\"the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\\") to a sweeping, melodic rock sound as displayed on The Remote Part and Warnings/Promises. In 2010, the band entered an indefinite hiatus, but reunited in late 2013 to record their seventh album, Everything Ever Written, released in 2015. This was followed by Interview Music in 2019. History =Beginnings (1995‚Äì1996)= Idlewild, named after the quiet meeting place in Anne of Green Gables, formed in December 1995 in Edinburgh, Scotland when a 19-year-old Roddy Woomble met drummer Colin Newton at a party. The two discovered that they had much in common, including similar musical interests and record collections. By the end of the night, they had discussed forming a band together. On the same night, the two were introduced to guitarist Rod Jones and the three kept in contact afterwards, meeting up to listen to music. Soon, the trio began writing songs together, and, in need of a bassist, they brought Phil Scanlon into the fold, due to the fact that he owned a bass guitar. Idlewild played their first show on 16 January 1996, at the Subway Club in Edinburgh to a crowd of thirty friends, which led to many more shows around Edinburgh throughout the course of the year. In May 1996 the band, now with over twenty songs written, entered Split Level Studios to record. The tape of these recordings earned the band many bookings at various venues around Scotland, including Glasgow. Local publications that heard the tape reviewed it favourably. Phil Scanlon decided to leave the band in February 1997 to concentrate on his studies. Since leaving Idlewild, he has become a highly successful chemical engineer and currently resides outside San Francisco. Woomble asked Bob Fairfoull to replace the departing bassist. Fairfoull had been present at every Idlewild show since the middle of 1996, and had impressed the others with his spoken-word, solo acoustic shows as well as his performances with Edinburgh band, Pussy Hoover. Fairfoull's debut with the band took place on 28 February at Glasgow bar, Nice N' Sleazy's. =Captain and Hope is Important (1997‚Äì1998)= The band's debut single \\"Queen of the Troubled Teens\\" was released on 17 March 1997, and built upon the chaotic reputation of their shows. Along with 'Self Healer', 'Satan Polaroid' and 'A Film for the Future', the song was included in a live session on Jeff Cooper's show 'XS' (now Radio2XS) on Sheffield's Hallam FM. It was also supported by BBC Radio Scotland DJ Peter Easton, and influential Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq. Lamacq was particularly impressed with the track \\"Self Healer\\" and asked, on the air, that if anyone knew anything about the band, they should contact him. In the summer of 1997, Idlewild played their first London shows which were attended by the likes of Lamacq, and representatives from Deceptive Records. Reviews at this time, in the pages of NME and Melody Maker compared their live gigs to \\"a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\\". The band were soon asked to record a single for Fierce Panda and to record an EP/mini-album with Deceptive Records. In October 1997, the band spent six days with producer Paul Tipler in South London. The result was Captain, which the band describes as \\"an innocent, frank nugget of noise pop magic\\". After the release of the \\"Chandelier\\" single, the band signed a deal with Food Records/EMI in December. Following the record deal, the members quit their respective jobs or university courses. 1998 marked the year where the public became actively aware of Idlewild, who kicked off the year with their first UK tour, supporting the band Midget. The release of Captain, on 18 January, received positive reviews in the NME, Melody Maker and Kerrang!. In February the band re-entered the studio, again with Paul Tipler, to record their first full-length album for Food Records. Two singles were released before the album's release, \\"A Film for the Future\\" (compared to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by one journalist) and \\"Everyone Says You're So Fragile\\". Both singles helped to expand the band's growing fanbase alongside notable appearances at summer festivals. October marked the arrival of their debut album Hope Is Important which the band now describes as \\"a confused, skewered, noisy, sad pop record\\". Further singles from the album included, \\"I'm a Message\\" and fan favourite, \\"When I Argue I See Shapes\\". Tours supporting Ash, Placebo and Manic Street Preachers followed the release. =100 Broken Windows (1999‚Äì2001)= Idlewild eventually returned to Edinburgh in 1999 to begin writing new songs, and contacted engineer Bob Weston, from Chicago, who recorded six songs with them in London. These songs held a more aggressive, emptier sound than those previously, and the band were pleased with the results; however, they remained unsure of their direction. During the summer, Idlewild were invited to play at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, a momentous day for Scottish history. Scotland is where the band would remain for a while, letting the surrounding environment influence their songwriting and letting the songs represent the band as they were. Hitting a stride, the band returned to the studio with producer Dave Eringa and recorded \\"Little Discourage\\" and \\"Roseability\\" in their first session. Very happy with the results, the band continued to record what would become their second full- length album, 100 Broken Windows. The song \\"Little Discourage\\" was released in September and brought Idlewild a larger fan-base and much more radio play. Hope Is Important was released in America, and to support it, the band performed a small number of tour dates on the East Coast. The remainder of the year was spent mixing the new album in Glasgow. In March the following year, the band released \\"Actually it's Darkness\\" and embarked on their biggest UK tour to date. Jeremy Mills joined the band on tour, playing guitar and keyboards. Their sound had now evolved from simplistic punk-rock to a more mature sound resembling R.E.M., Echo & the Bunnymen, and The Smiths. 100 Broken Windows reached silver status in the UK and the band went on tour in Europe and North America. Further singles released from the album included \\"These Wooden Ideas\\" and \\"Roseability\\". As 2001 began, the band re-entered the studio, this time with producer Stephen Street, to record songs written in the last half of 2000. While happy with the results the band put their next album aside to tour America. American music magazine Spin named 100 Broken Windows the \\"number one album you didn't hear in 2000\\" and the album received other rave reviews in the American press on its release in April. Whilst touring the album in America, Allan Stewart replaced Jeremy Mills as touring guitarist. Readers of The Skinny magazine in Scotland would retrospectively vote 100 Broken Windows 'The Scottish Album of the Decade' in December 2009. =The Remote Part (2002‚Äì2003)= Idlewild eventually moved up to the highlands of Scotland and began the writing and demoing process of what would become The Remote Part. Both Allan and Jeremy joined the band in a cottage in Inchnadamph, Sutherland. Woomble began a friendship with Scottish Makar (poet laureate) Edwin Morgan who would eventually end up on the song \\"Scottish Fiction,\\" the album's closing track. The remainder of the year was spent recording and mixing the album in various locations with producer Dave Eringa. This period marked the band's longest absence from performing. The first single from the album, \\"You Held the World in Your Arms\\", became 'A-listed' on Radio One and entered the UK Singles Chart at number nine, marking the band's biggest hit to date. A UK tour followed with Ikara Colt supporting and a second single, \\"American English\\", was released. On release, The Remote Part entered the album charts at number three, and was considered a record of considerable depth, as well as one of the most melodic records of the year. The album went gold in the UK and a third single, \\"Live in a Hiding Place\\", was released as the band embarked upon a four-month European tour in September, which included supporting dates with Coldplay. On 30 September 2002, Idlewild took to the stage in Cologne with their guitar tech Alex Grant playing bass instead of Bob Fairfoull, with Roddy Woomble commenting during the show that Fairfoull had left the band. On 3 October, Idlewild officially announced the departure of Fairfoull due to ‚Äúpersonal problems‚Äù. Fairfoull had become increasingly distant from the band over the past year, often being absent during the recording of The Remote Part, and his drinking habits were having a negative impact on his bass playing. Things came to a head with Fairfoull in an argument after a show in Amsterdam, with Woomble later commenting that dismissing Fairfoull ‚Äúwas the best thing that could have happened to the band,‚Äù and that ‚Äúit meant we all finally agreed on how we were going to move forward.‚Äù The band and Fairfoull remained friends, with Fairfoull going on to play bass with Edinburgh-based band Degrassi and Paper Beats Rock. In the immediate aftermath of Fairfoull's departure, Idlewild fulfilled their tour dates for the rest of the year with Grant on bass. On 20 November, Idlewild unveiled Gavin Fox of the Irish band Turn as their new bassist, with touring guitarist Allan Stewart also becoming a permanent member of the band. Fairfoull approved of being replaced as Idlewild bassist by his good friend Fox, though he also added, \\"It felt a bit like if you left your wife, and a week later she started shagging your brother. But I realised there‚Äôs no point being bitter, they‚Äôve got to continue as a band.\\" 2002 was Idlewild's most successful year, with The Remote Part entering many 'Best of the Year' lists. With Fox and Stewart officially in the band, Idlewild spent January of the following year writing songs and practising in an old lighthouse outside Edinburgh. A final single from The Remote Part, \\"A Modern Way of Letting Go\\", introduced the new line-up to the UK via several television appearances and another short tour of Britain and Ireland. The Remote Part received its US release in March 2003 and the band embarked upon a cross-continent, nine-week headline tour playing their biggest US shows in New York City and Los Angeles. The band then returned to America in May at the request of Pearl Jam, who asked the band to open one leg of their Riot Act world tour. These were the biggest venues Idlewild had played in, and they found friends in Pearl Jam, even playing with them onstage on the final night in Chicago. Subsequently, in June 2007 Pearl Jam requested Idlewild to support them for a one-off date at Wembley Arena. =Warnings/Promises (2004‚Äì2005)= As 2004 began, Idlewild spent the first four months of the year writing and demoing new songs up in the Scottish Highlands, and in Roddy's flat in London. The band chose to work with American producer Tony Hoffer and flew out to Los Angeles and spent the next three months recording and mixing the new songs. This marked the first time Idlewild had recorded an album all in one go. The band finished up the record in October 2004 in New York with mixer Michael Brauer. Roddy rented a room on the Lower East Side and stayed there for the remainder of the year, listening to the album they'd just made. 2004 became the first in the band's existence devoted almost entirely to writing and recording an album. At the end of this year they titled it Warnings/Promises. 2005 began with a series of acoustic shows around the UK. The first single from Warnings/Promises, entitled \\"Love Steals Us from Loneliness\\", appeared in February and became Idlewild's fourth Top 20 single. The album followed two weeks later and debuted within the UK Top Ten. Warnings/Promises received mainly positive reviews; however, some critics and fans disliked the band's direction with this album. In the UK, the band embarked upon an extensive UK tour, changing the setlist every night and revisiting songs from each of their albums. In the summer, Idlewild played a number of festivals and opened shows for U2, R.E.M. and the Pixies. In November, the band announced that they had parted ways with their record company Parlophone after fulfilling their contractual obligation over eight years, leaving them without a record deal. However, despite rumours that they were breaking up, the band claimed that they were looking forward to the future. The year ended with a Christmas show at Barrowlands, a famed Glasgow venue and the band's \\"spiritual home\\". After this gig, Gavin Fox left the band, with Woomble citing Fox's reluctance to be in a touring rock band and eagerness to stay home in Ireland where he would write songs and sing for his own band, Curse of Cain. Fox was replaced by former Astrid bassist Gareth Russell. =Make Another World (2006‚Äì2007)= Idlewild performing at The Outsider festival in Aviemore, 23 June 2007 In July 2006, Roddy Woomble released an album of folk music under his own name titled My Secret is My Silence. Woomble's solo material was written alongside Rod Jones, friend Michael Angus and folksinger Karine Polwart, and produced by folk musician John McCusker. Roddy toured the album in July and August. Jones meanwhile worked on an album with Inara George called George Is Jones The band spent many months writing new material, which was recorded with 100 Broken Windows and The Remote Part producer Dave Eringa in their rehearsal room. In July 2006, it was announced Idlewild would sign to 1960s label Sequel, which was reactivated by music group Sanctuary. The album Make Another World was released on 5 March 2007. \\"If It Takes You Home\\" was the first single released from it and was available as a download and 7\\" single. \\"No Emotion\\" was the second single released; it went to No. 36 in the UK Top 40 chart. \\"A Ghost in the Arcade\\" was the next single, released on 18 June, though only as an internet-downloadable track and not available on physical CD. At the 19 March 2007 Aberdeen concert on the Make Another World UK Tour, Woomble announced the show was being filmed for a live DVD release (included with the special edition of the band's greatest hits album Scottish Fiction - Best of 1997-2007). The band played a twenty-three song setlist which included a considerable number of songs from earlier albums such as Hope is Important. It was at this gig that the video for \\"A Ghost in the Arcade\\" was filmed. During their 16 May gig in The Liquid Room, Edinburgh, Woomble announced an Idlewild 'Greatest Hits' compilation would be released later in the year at the request of former label Parlophone. Scottish Fiction - Best of 1997-2007 was released on 1 October 2007 by Parlophone and is a 17 track 'best of' compilation featuring career highlights, and includes the aforementioned DVD. A second compilation album was also released on 29 October. A Distant History - Rarities 1997-2007 included the band's early singles as well as many B-sides and was available only through download stores. =Post Electric Blues and hiatus (2008‚Äì2010)= The band continued to play more gigs while working on their next album. Meanwhile, Woomble started writing a column for Scottish newspaper The Sunday Herald and released an album with Kris Drever and John McCusker, entitled Before the Ruin, in September 2008. In December 2008 the band played five shows at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, playing each of their studio albums in full. Roddy Woomble noted that the band were \\"going to try to play every track [they'd] ever written ‚Äì including B-sides ‚Äì which has to be more than 100 songs.\\" In February 2009, they announced that they would be staging a similar residency at Dingwalls in Camden, London. A new song, \\"City Hall\\", appeared in a setlist, and the band entered the studio in January 2009. On his online diary, Roddy Woomble noted that he had: \\"been trying to work on lyrics for the new Idlewild record. At the moment it has the possibility of being about anything, so I've been trying to narrow that down a bit. I've been re- reading Jack Kerouac's novels and following this US election, and keeping up with all the new US groups, so maybe it'll take on a Stars and stripes theme. It'll probably end up being about mountains and Islands though.\\" On 21 November the band sent an email to fans on the mailing list offering them a chance to preorder the new album (along with \\"exclusive packaging & including at least one bonus track\\") to be \\"shipped within weeks of completion\\". All fans who bought the album this way would also have their name appear in the CD booklet and on a roll call on the band's official website. On 9 May 2009, Roddy confirmed in his online diary that the new album would be entitled Post Electric Blues. The album was performed in full on 19 May. Initial emails indicated a release date to fans who had pre-ordered the album of mid-April, but the album was eventually mailed out on 10 June 2009. Fans who pre-ordered the album were also allowed to download their choice of live tracks that the band had recorded at the King Tut's series of shows. The album was officially released in October, preceded by the single \\"Readers & Writers\\". In April 2010, Woomble announced that the band would enter a hiatus following the band's tour in support of Post Electric Blues. However this comment only referred to the writing and recording of new material as Woomble later suggested. Idlewild announced their first American tour since 2005 and a short UK tour in support of the EMI re-release of 100 Broken Windows. During the UK shows (as well as a New York and Los Angeles show) the album was to be played in its entirety. However, due to an injury to Rod Jones, the American dates were cancelled. The 100 Broken Windows reissue was released on 8 November 2010 and featured a second disc of B-Sides and unreleased material. =Renewed activity and Everything Ever Written (2013‚Äì2018)= In September 2013, rumours of a reunion began as the band posted a photo on their official Facebook page with the caption \\"What's going on here...?\\" Woomble, Jones and Newton were tagged in the photo of a recording/rehearsal studio. On 5 November, Woomble confirmed that the band were in the process of writing a new album, stating: \\"I have been getting asked about this a lot recently, and it is no secret that Idlewild are making a new album (There are some photographs of a recent writing session in a Hebridean cabin up on the Idlewild facebook page) it is being written and recorded slowly and intermittently, and I have no idea when it‚Äôll be done. Not for a while. I‚Äôm just enjoying the process. It is always great to work with Rod and Colin, we have been making up songs together since 1995 ‚Äì not far off 20 years! Gareth and Allan have not been involved much so far due to both their other touring commitments, but they will be in time, as will others.\\" In January 2014 the band started recording their next studio effort and had two 'live' dates, one at Musicport. Through his blog Roddy Woomble revealed that Gareth Russell had left the band back in 2013 and multi- instrumentalist Luciano Rossi had joined the band. The band announced the release of their upcoming seventh studio album Everything Ever Written on 3 November 2014 on the BBC 6 Music Steve Lamacq show, debuting the new single \\"Collect Yourself\\". In addition to Woomble, Jones and Newton, the album also included contributions from new members Rossi and bassist Andrew Mitchell of The Hazey Janes. = The Remote Part 15th anniversary shows (2017-2018) = On 16 October 2017, Idlewild announced they would be marking the 15th anniversary of The Remote Part by playing the album in full at two Christmas shows at the O2 ABC in Glasgow on 19 and 20 December. After tickets for the Glasgow dates immediately sold out, the band added another show at KOKO in London. The second Glasgow show was also notable for surprise guest appearances by former Idlewild members Allan Stewart and Bob Fairfoull. Idlewild would then spend 2018 by working on a new album, though they did play another The Remote Part anniversary show in Edinburgh with Fairfoull once again appearing as a special guest. = Interview Music (2019‚Äìpresent) = In February 2019 mailing list recipients received notification of a new Idlewild album to pre-order on multiple formats as well as a tour of the UK in the Spring. The new album, Interview Music, was released on 5 April. The band also welcomed back Allan Stewart on second guitar for their live shows, with his involvement enabling them to play more different styles. Solo work Jones released his debut solo album, A Sentimental Education, in 2009. In 2010, Jones founded The Fruit Tree Foundation, alongside Emma Pollock (The Delgados), in order to raise awareness of mental health problems. Jones released his second solo album, A Generation Innocence, in August 2012; however, while writing for the second album, Jones encountered a hurdle at the halfway mark, as he discovered that he was not satisfied with any of the material that he had written thus far. In 2011, Jones explained, \\"I was a bit fed up with the whole folk music thing ‚Äì I mean every man and his dog was doing the faux folk thing\\"‚ÄîJones then proceeded to learn the drums and eventually formed the band, The Birthday Suit, to record the material that he had created in the period following the drumming diversion. In late 2011, Jones formed The Birthday Suit and described the band as \\"essentially a solo project ... It's an ever-changing bistro of musicians.\\" The band released its debut album, The Eleventh Hour, in October 2011. The Birthday Suit's second studio album, A Conversation Well Rehearsed was released on 3 December 2012. The album was listed in 19th place in the Clean Slate Music website's \\"Top 21 Albums of 2012\\" list, although the website wrote that the second album \\"doesn't carry the punch\\" of the band's debut album. In 2006, Woomble worked with several musicians including Kate Rusby, his wife Ailidh Lennon, songwriter Karine Polwart (to whom he presented the Horizon Award at the BBC Folk Awards 2005, and with whom he performed at Celtic Connections) and Idlewild guitarist Rod Jones on his debut solo album My Secret is My Silence, produced by John McCusker. The album was released in July 2006, and Woomble toured the United Kingdom in support of the album's release. My Secret is my Silence reached number one in the UK Folk Charts, and a year later, on 10 July 2007, My Secret is my Silence was released in the United States on 7‚Äì10 Music. Woomble's follow-up album, Before the Ruin, written and recorded with Kris Drever and John McCusker, was released on 15 September 2008 through Navigator Records. In March 2011, Woomble released his second solo album, The Impossible Song & Other Songs.

Acoustic sounds (bandone√≥n, piano, guitar, cello, and even the Chinese stringed instrument, the erhu) are more predominant than in Tanghetto's debut album Emigrante (Electrotango).

They, along with the Byrds, Carters, Washingtons, Harrisons and others, were at the core of Virginia's aristocracy for centuries. First Families of Virginia (FFV) were those families in Colonial Virginia who were socially prominent and wealthy, but not necessarily the earliest settlers.Tyler, Lyon Gardiner, ed. (April 1915). \\"The F. F. V.'s of Virginia\\". William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine. Richmond, Virginia: Whittet & Shepperson. page 277. They descended from English colonists who primarily settled at Jamestown, Williamsburg, The Northern Neck and along the James River and other navigable waters in Virginia during the 17th century. These elite families generally married within their social class for many generations and, as a result, most surnames of First Families date to the colonial period. The American Revolution cut ties with Britain but not with its social traditions. While some First Family members were loyal to Britain, others were Whigs who not only supported, but led the Revolution. Most First Families remained in Virginia, where they flourished as tobacco planters, and from the sale of slaves to the cotton states to the south. Indeed, many younger sons were relocated into the cotton belt to start their own plantations. The Civil War devastated the Virginia economy, and emancipated all the slaves without compensation. Planters and small farmers both were economically hurt, but in general the First Families, albeit poorer than before, maintained social and political leadership. Marshall Fishwick says that by the 1950s, \\"the old-time aristocracy [had] not given up, or sunk into decadence as Southern novelists suggest.\\" They adopted modern agricultural technology and co-opted rich \\"Yankees\\" into their upper-class, rural horse- estate society. English heritage, second sons Rosewell, painted by Charles Bridges. The Rosewell plantation was called one of the finest homes in colonial America and built of brick imported from England. English colonists who formed the FFV emigrated to the new Colony of Virginia. Their migration took place from the settlement of Jamestown through the English Civil War and English Interregnum period (1642‚Äì1660). Some royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized Charles II as King following the execution of Charles I in 1649, Charles II reputedly called Virginia his \\"Old Dominion\\" ‚Äì a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early supposedly aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \\"distressed Cavaliers\\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Some Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. FFVs often refer to Virginia as \\"Cavalier Country\\". These men were offered land or other rewards by King Charles II, but most who had settled in Virginia stayed in Virginia. Many such early settlers in Virginia were so called \\"Second Sons\\". Primogeniture favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Second or third sons went out to the colonies to make their fortune, or entered the military and the clergy. Tidewater Virginia evolved as a society descended from second or third sons of English gentry who inherited land grants or land in Virginia. They formed part of what became the southern elite in America. In some cases, longstanding ties among families of the English gentry were carried to the new colony, where they were reinforced by marriage and other relations. For instance, there were ancestral ties between the Spencer family of Bedfordshire and the Washington family; a Spencer secured the land grant later purchased by the Washingtons, where they built their Mount Vernon home. These sorts of ties were common in the early colony, as families shuttled back and forth between England and Virginia, maintaining their connections with the mother country and with each other. A thin network of increasingly interrelated families made up the planter elite and held power in colonial Virginia. \\"As early as 1660 every seat on the ruling Council of Virginia was held by members of five interrelated families,\\" writes British historian John Keegan, \\"and as late as 1775 every council member was descended from one of the 1660 councillors.\\" The ties among Virginia families were based on marriage. In a pre-Revolutionary War economy dependent on the production of tobacco as a commodity crop, the ownership of the best land was tightly controlled. It often passed between families of corresponding social rank. The Virginia economy was based on slave labor as the colony became a slave society. The landed gentry could keep tight rein on political power, which passed in somewhat orderly fashion from family to family. (In the more modern mercantile economy of the north, social mobility became more prominent. The power of the elite was muted by newcomers who gained wealth in the market economy.) Pocahontas  Simon de Passe Pocahontas (1595‚Äì1617), a Native American, was the daughter of Chief Powhatan, founder of the Powhatan Confederacy. According to Mattaponi and Patawomeck tradition, Pocahontas was previously married to a Patawomeck weroance, Kocoum, who was murdered by Englishmen when Samuel Argall abducted her on April 13, 1613. Educated among the English of Virginia and converted to Christianity during her captivity in Henricus, Pocahontas married colonist John Rolfe at a church in Jamestown on April 5, 1614. Rolfe had become prominent and wealthy as the first to successfully develop an export cash crop for the colony with new varieties of tobacco. Their only child, Thomas Rolfe, was born on January 30, 1615. He married and had a family: his descendants married into other elite families. Pocahontas was much celebrated in London where she was welcomed with great ceremony at the Royal Court. She died young but became legendary as the first Indian from Virginia to become Christian, marry an Englishman, and have a known child from such a marriage. (There were no doubt mixed-race children born to lower-class colonists and Algonquian women, although they may have been neither married nor Christian.) She became an important symbol of friendly Native American-English relations of the Jamestown colony. By virtue of many fictional accounts, her marriage was romanticized and became part of the mythology of early American history.Camilla Townsend, Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma (2007)F. W. Gleach, Powhatan's world and colonial Virginia (1997) Organizing the FFV In 1887, following the Reconstruction era after the Civil War, Virginia Governor Wyndham Robertson wrote the first history of Pocahontas and her descendants, delineating the ancestry of FFV families including the Bollings, Clements, Whittles, Blands, Skipwiths, Flemings, Catletts, Gays, Jordans, Randolphs, Tazewells, and many others. Wyndham Robertson, Pocahontas, alias Matoaka, and Her Descendants, Richmond VA: J. W. Randolph & English, 1887 Excluded from this history were 'natural children', mixed-race descendants of unions with slaves. Families often used surnames as given names, as in the \\"Johns\\" of Johns Hopkins University. A mother's maiden name might be used as a \\"middle name\\", to document that part of the person's ancestry. For example, Lt. Col. Powhatan Bolling Whittle of the 38th Virginia Infantry, Confederate States Army was an uncle of Matoaka Whittle Sims.Lt. Col. Powhattan Bolling Whittle, Victorian Villa: Sims-Mitchell history In 1907, the Jamestown Exposition was held near Norfolk to celebrate the tricentennial of the arrival of the first English colonists and the founding of Jamestown. Preservation Virginia, formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was founded in Williamsburg in 1889 to memorialize Virginia history. In the 20th century, Preservation Virginia emphasized patriotism by highlighting the Founding Fathers that hailed from Virginia.

Much of the drill done today is either ceremonial, or implemented as a core part of training in the Armed Forces. Military discipline is enhanced by drill, as it requires instant obedience to commands and synchronized completion of said commands with the others in the unit. Drill proved useful when marching formations of soldiers cross-country. For example, officers could form men from an eight-wide route march formation to a two-wide formation for passing through gates and other narrow passages, without losing time or cohesion. Drill was used to efficiently maneuver formations around and through obstacles. Drill was often used as a forerunner to great battles; during them it justified itself. It was also utilized after battles, where quick restoration of the corporate unity of an element was required. Drill in antiquity Nicholas I of Russia was nicknamed a drill-master on account of his devotion to mindless drill Vegetius composed his treatise on the Roman Empire's military, De Re Militari, at some point between 378 and 390 CE during the reign of Valentinian II in the Western Roman Empire. This work consists of three separate, yet related books, the first establishing methods of training and selecting new recruits, the second and third books a continuation of the first, describing in detail training and discipline matters as they pertained not only to the troops, but also to the leadership in times of training and battle, as well as positing an argument for reforms in the army. Within these books can be found a detailed guide for drill of the army. Among these drills, the military step describes how initial training should consist of \\"constant practice of marching quick and together. Nor is anything of more consequence either on the march or in the line than that they should keep their ranks with the greatest exactness. For troops who march in an irregular and disorderly manner are always in great danger of being defeated. They should march with the common military step twenty miles in five summer-hours, and with the full step, which is quicker, twenty-four miles in the same number of hours. If they exceed this pace, they no longer march but run, and no certain rate can be assigned.\\" De Re Militari, Book I: The Selection and Training of New Levies History of drill Drill became less common after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the resultant disappearance of professional armies from Western Europe. In the Middle Ages the individualist nature of Knightly combat, focusing on individual skills and heroism, coupled with the ad-hoc nature of the supporting levies meant that there was no place for mass subordination of troops through Drill. The rise of the mercenary during the renaissance led to some level of military professionalisation: this led to co- ordinated and practiced military units such as the Swiss mercenaries but standardisation was still lacking. The mass use of firearms in the later 16th Century led to the resurgence of what was considered at the time \\"Roman-Style Drill\\". This movement was pioneered by Maurice of Nassau.Howard, The Mask of Command, p. 170 Intended to enable his soldiers to efficiently handle their firearms, it describes forty-two movements from taking up the weapon to firing. As armies became full-time and more professionalised over the course of the 17th Century it became a natural progression for drill to expand its remit from weapons handling to the manoeuvre and forming of bodies of troops. The most notable figure of the early 17th Century was Gustavus Adolphus, who fielded one of the largest standing armies of the Thirty Years' War before his death in battle. What would today be known strictly as foot drill emerged over the course of the 17th Century. This period is known as the Pike and Shot period, where muskets and arquebus without bayonets were defended from infantry and cavalry by blocks of pikemen. The requirement for quick and accurate movement of these large bodies of troops in order to outmanoeuvre their opponents on the tactical level led to the introduction of standardised movements and commands. These were the first versions of foot drill, intended to allow a group of disparate individuals to form one organised body of men, moving singlemindedly with united purpose. Additionally, in the confusion of battle it was found that the clear and concise nature of drill commands allowed the individual soldier to cope with the psychological stresses of battle. The apogee of this style of warfare is arguably the English Civil War, as the last major war using these methods before the introduction of the bayonet created \\"The Queen of Battles\\": the Line Infantry. Line infantry won or lost on the rigidity of their foot drill. In the later 17th century that drill evolved into a tool for the complete subordination of the individual. The Prussians demanded automatonic levels of drill competence. Constant and heavy drilling would change a man from a civilian to a soldier, obedient to commands reflexively. This instituted both disciple and subordination. In a period when private soldiers were recruited from what was considered the basest social class, it was considered particularly important to \\"break the man\\" into service. For all this harshness, desertion remained commonplace. In battle, drill was a force multiplier. With the muskets of the era having short ranges owing to the nature of their ammunition and the reluctance of men to kill one another at short range,Grossman, On Killing it was necessary for battalions to form up as broad lines 2 to 4 ranks deep at distances averaging 25 yards (approx 20 m). In such conditions, particularly when one considers the nightmarish nature of the ubiquitous cannonade and the buildup of smoke from musket discharge, drill allowed the soldier to withdraw into himself and react to commands. There are anecdotal reports of soldiers in this almost trance-like state reaching out to try and catch cannonballs at the end of their arcs, with unpleasant results. The psychological boost which being part of an effectively faceless mass and surrendering one's fate to that of the corporate group provided enabled men to stand in the face of the enemy that bit longer than their foes. As such, the better the drill, the better ‚Äì in theory ‚Äì the soldiers. These elements were found to be particularly powerful in colonial theatres by most European states, where massed drill and the discipline that imbued allowed small expeditionary forces to repeatedly defeat larger indigenous forces. Additionally, greater drill equated to greater manoeuvrability. When troops were thoroughly drilled they could move confidently at speed without their formations ‚Äì carefully proscribed in order to maximise the use of their weapons ‚Äì breaking up, particularly over rough ground. When formations broke up precious time would have to be spent reforming them in the face of the enemy: additionally, loose formations breed confusion. The difference between a body of troops and a disorganised crowd is a narrow one. As such, when faced with musketry, cavalry or cannonade a loose formation would be more prone to succumbing to panic and rout. Proficiency in drill further enabled the creativity of generals. Troops who are new to drill are unconfident and tend to panic or become confused when new commands are introduced. Troops who do many drills can more easily be taught new formations, building off the base of experience previously garnered. In a period when all war was foot drill, this could obviously prove an advantage. As an example, the British used an unorthodox two rank line during the later 18th and early-to-mid 19th Centuries as a force multiplier. In the Peninsular Campaign they were able to adapt this formation from strictly linear to a shallow crescent. Coordinating even a minor formation change for roughly 200 men was considered an impressive feat. Drill was exported to the rest of the world on the back of Colonial victories, with most Imperial nations training local armed forces in European-style drill. One famous example of this trend were the Indian Sepoys of the British Empire. As weapons gained in range and accuracy, foot drill became less and less important in battle. Advances as formed lines and columns were still attempted - they worked during the Crimean War but were becoming dangerously obsolete by the time of the Franco-Prussian War. The last widespread use of formed infantry in the attack, particularly in columns, was in the first few weeks of the First World War. =Origins of modern drill in the U.S. Military= Baron von Steuben United States military drill originated in 1778, as part of a training program implemented by Baron Friedrich von Steuben to improve the discipline and organisation of soldiers serving in the Continental Army. The following year Baron von Steuben, by then a Major General and the Inspector General of the Continental Army, wrote the Army's first field manual, \\"The Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States\\", which has come to be more commonly known as the \\"Blue Book\\". The methods of drill that von Steuben initiated remained largely unchanged between their inception and the time of the American Civil War. One major change to come about since that time is that troops now march at a cadence of 120 steps per minute, instead of the original 76 steps per minute at the time of the American Revolution. The stated aim of drill is to \\"enable a commander or noncommissioned officer to move his unit from one place to another in an orderly manner; to aid in disciplinary training by instilling habits of precision and response to the leader‚Äôs orders; and to provide for the development of all soldiers in the practice of commanding troops.\\" US Army FM 3-21.5 Drill and Ceremonies Between branches of the military, as well as between the military forces of various countries, the methods of drill will vary. In the United States Armed Forces, the basis of drill procedures can be traced to von Steuben's \\"Blue Book\\". Drill in the modern day Drill rehearsals for female soldiers participating in the 2011 Republic Day Parade. Drill today is used as a teaching tool for instilling discipline into new recruits in armies the world over, although style and diligence varies from nation to nation. Some of the most famous drill in the world remains that of the Guards Division. Drill is most commonly seen at ceremonial and public functions and has evolved into something of an art-form. Many nations have dedicated Drill Teams, although the Guards Division, faithful to the history of Foot Drill, remain full service combat infantry.

Knowlton (November 22, 1740 ‚Äì September 16, 1776) was an American patriot who served in the French and Indian War and was a colonel during the American Revolution. Knowlton is considered America's first Intelligence professional, and his unit, Knowlton's Rangers, gathered intelligence during the early Revolutionary War. Knowlton was killed in action at the Battle of Harlem Heights. Early life and education Knowlton was born into a military family on November 22, 1740 in West Boxford, Massachusetts. When he was eight, his family relocated to a farm in Ashford, Connecticut (current property of the June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation). In 1755, at fifteen, Knowlton served in the French and Indian War with his older brother Daniel. He enlisted in Captain John Durkee's company, and is known to have joined Daniel on scouting missions into enemy territory. He later served in Captain John Slapp's 8th Company, where he served with Throope Chapman. He served during six campaigns in the war and was promoted to lieutenant in 1760. He also fought in Israel Putnam's company against the Spanish during the British expedition against Cuba in 1762. By August 1762, Knowlton had returned home and married Anna Keyes. He and his wife raised nine children. At the age of thirty-three, Knowlton was appointed a Selectman of Ashford, Connecticut.Connecticut Sons of the American Revolution: Journal, 2010  Battle of Bunker Hill  On April 18, 1775, General Thomas Gage dispatched a contingent of British troops to Lexington and Concord, about fifteen miles from Boston, Massachusetts. This action led to the outbreak of hostilities that became the American Revolution. On learning of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the militias of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire communities mobilized their members. Thomas Knowlton joined his militia, the Ashford Company, which became part of the 5th Connecticut Regiment, along with the men from Windham, Mansfield and Coventry, Connecticut. Knowlton was chosen unanimously as captain and led 200 men into Massachusetts. His force consisted of farmers, without uniforms, primarily armed with shotguns.Baker, 2014, pp.78-79 Knowlton was ordered to Charlestown to join Colonel William Prescott. Knowlton's troops were sent by Colonel Prescott to oppose the advancing British grenadiers, and took their posts on the side of Breed's hill. Knowlton was in command of a 200 men work party. His men dismantled another fence further back and its rails to strengthen the existing fence, the space between with new-mown grass which formed an effective breastwork. There they held their ground until the general retreat, and were among those providing cover as the troops retreated. Only three men from Knowlton's company died in the battle.Moran, 1985 In 1776, Knowlton was sent by General Washington during the Siege of Boston to burn any remaining buildings at the base of Bunker Hill, with orders to capture any British troops guarding the location. Knowlton accomplished his mission without firing a shot or losing a single man.Connecticut Sons of the American Revolution, 2010 Years later, Colonel Aaron Burr said: \\"I had a full account of the Battle from Knowlton's own lips, and I believe if the chief command had been entrusted to him, the issue would have proved more fortunate. It was impossible to promote such a man too rapidly.\\" In June 1775, for his bravery at Bunker Hill, Knowlton was promoted by Congress to major. One of his men later remembered that Knowlton was very courageous, never crying, Go on, boys! but always, Come on, boys!.Rose, 2007, p. 16 On January 8, 1776, he led a troop in a successful incursion into Charlestown to burn housing used by British officers. Knowlton's Rangers Thomas Knowlton statue (Enoch Smith Woods, sculptor) at Connecticut State Capitol On August 12, 1776, General of the Army George Washington promoted Knowlton to lieutenant colonel. He was ordered to select a group of men from Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts to carry out reconnaissance missions. America's first official spies, \\"Knowlton's Rangers\\" were also the first organized American elite troops.Military History, 2016 The American spy, Captain Nathan Hale, was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton. The date \\"1776\\" on the modern U.S. Army's intelligence service seal refers to the formation of Knowlton's Rangers.Baker, 2014, p. 82 On September 16, 1776, a company of rangers led by Knowlton was scouting in advance of Washington's army at the Battle of Harlem Heights. While reconnoitering the British outposts they were engaged by elements of the light infantry brigade commanded by Major General Alexander Leslie. They managed a successful retreat and later mounted a counter-attack with the support of riflemen led by Major Andrew Leitch of Virginia. General Washington ordered the units to fall on the enemy's rear, while a feint in front engaged the British troops‚Äô attention. Knowlton's force turned prematurely and made contact with the right flank of the British instead, losing the element of surprise. In the face of heavy fire from the British, Knowlton rallied his troops to carry on the attack. Both American commanding officers fell mortally wounded in front of their men. Knowlton's loss was lamented by Washington in his general orders for September 17, 1776 with the statement \\"The gallant and brave Col Knowlton, ... would have been an Honor to any Country, having fallen yesterday, while gloriously fighting ...for his country \\".  Knowlton Award  In 1995 the Military Intelligence Corps Association established the LTC Thomas W. Knowlton Award. The Knowlton Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to the promotion of Army Military Intelligence in ways that stand out in the eyes of the recipients, their superiors, subordinates and peers. These individuals must also demonstrate the highest standards of integrity and moral character, display an outstanding degree of professional competence, and serve the MI Corps with distinction. An August 1, 2012 posthumous recipient of the Knowlton Award was Marian Rejewski, the mathematician-cryptologist at the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau who in late 1932 reconstructed the German military Enigma cipher machine. Marian Rejewski's posthumous Knowlton Award was accepted at his home town, Bydgoszcz, Poland, on September 4, 2012 by his mathematician daughter, Janina Sylwestrzak.\\"Najwy≈ºsze odznaczenie ameryka≈Ñskiego wywiadu za z≈Çamanie kod√≥w Enigmy\\" (\\"Highest American Intelligence Award for Breaking Enigma Ciphers\\"), Gwiazda Polarna (The Pole Star), vol. 103, no. 20 (September 22, 2012), p. 6.

Despite its name, the station is not close to the river Tisza; it was named after the company that built it. History Miskolc's need for connection with other cities by railway lines arose in the 1830s. Plans were made to expand the Szolnok‚ÄìDebrecen railway line towards Ny√≠regyh√°za and Miskolc, but due to the political situations of the time ‚Äì there was a revolution against Habsburg rule in 1848‚Äì49 ‚Äì construction was delayed until 1857. Disagreements between the railway constructing company and the local government of the city hindered work. The local government wanted the station to be built at the end of Sz√©chenyi Street, the main street of Miskolc, approximately where the Szinvapark shopping mall stands today, and said the area that the constructing company appointed (and where the station was eventually built) was too far from the city ‚Äì at that time it was indeed about 2,5 kilometres away and the cost of transporting goods from the city to the station was too high for local merchants. Because of the disagreement the local government didn't support the building of the railway lines, and on May 24, 1859 the newly built station was opened without any opening ceremony. The station was simply called \\"Miskolc Railway Station\\" then; it got its current name in 1959. In 1860 Miskolc was connected by railway to Ko≈°ice (then called Kassa, it was the other leading city of Northern Hungary and in many ways a rival of Miskolc), in 1870 the Miskolc-Pest line was ready, and in 1871 the G√∂m√∂r line was built. On June 2, 1944 the US Air Force bombed the station as a part of Operation Frantic Joe. Many bombs fell on the city centre instead, claiming 206 lives (420 were wounded). The building Main entrance of Tiszai Station The station building that stands today was designed by Ferenc Pfaff and was built in 1901 in eclectic style. It is a listed historic building and was restored recently, in 1999. It was modernized in 2003. During the construction of the building important archaeological findings were made, indicating a Celtic presence in the area. Kand√≥ K√°lm√°n square The square where the station stands is one of the most important traffic hubs of Miskolc. Both of the Miskolc tram lines and several bus lines (1, 1A, 101, 17, 21, 23, 31) of MVK ZRt. have their terminus here.

Beban won the 1967 Heisman Trophy, narrowly beating out O.J. Simpson, and the Maxwell Award while playing quarterback for the UCLA Bruins. He played professional football for two seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Washington Redskins. Beban was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988. Early life The son of an Italian-born mother and a first-generation Croatian-American father,Croatian Chronicle Network 35 Pacific Northwest Croatian Athletes Beban graduated from Sequoia High School in Redwood City, California. College career Beban, known as \\"The Great One\\", excelled in both academics and athletics, majoring in European history while quarterbacking the Bruins across three straight winning seasons. As a quarterback at the University of California, Los Angeles, he was named to the all-conference team three times, and led the Bruins to a 24‚Äì5‚Äì2 record. His school record for total offense lasted for 15 years. As a sophomore, he threw two touchdown passes in the last four minutes to rally the Bruins over their crosstown arch-rival, USC, 20‚Äì16.UCLA Athletics: 1964-1965 UCLA.eduL.A.'s greatest moments 100 greatest #35 1965: Bruin sophomore Gary Beban heaves fourth-quarter touchdown passes to Dick Witcher and Kurt Altenberg to stun USC and Heisman Trophy winner Mike Garrett, 20-16. In the 1966 Rose Bowl, Beban scored both UCLA's touchdowns in the Bruins' 14‚Äì12 victory over 1 ranked Michigan State. In his senior year, Beban played in the 1967 USC vs. UCLA football game, widely regarded as one of the best college football games of all time. The game pitted No. 4 AP (No. 2 UPI) ranked USC, and their Heisman Trophy candidate running back O. J. Simpson, against the No. 1 ranked Bruins and Beban‚Äîalso a Heisman Trophy candidate‚Äîwith both the AAWU and national championships on the line. Badly injured with torn rib cartilage and in great pain, he still threw for over 300 yards and two touchdown passes to lead the Bruins in scoring. Although USC eventually won the game 21‚Äì20 on a blocked PAT, and went on to the Rose Bowl, Beban would go on to win the Heisman Trophy. Both Beban and Simpson were featured on the cover of the November 20 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine.USC VS.

Sports Illustrated, November 20, 1967, Volume 27, Issue 21 Commenting on Beban's heroic effort playing through injury, famed L.A. Times columnist Jim Murray wrote that if \\"Gary Beban wins the Heisman Trophy, they ought to fill it with aspirin\\". In addition to winning the Heisman, Beban was unanimously named to the All-America Team,1975 UCLA Media Guide, UCLA Athletic News Bureau, 1975 won the Maxwell Award, and was awarded the Washington Touchdown Club Trophy and the W. J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast. He was also named a National Football Foundation Scholar-Athlete and received the Dolly Cohen award, given to the player best combining academic and football achievement. UCLA became the first school to have a player of the year winner in both basketball and football in the same year, with Beban winning the Heisman Trophy and Lew Alcindor winning the U.S. Basketball Writers Association player of the year award in 1968. For one week in November 1967, UCLA had the No. 1 ranked football and men's basketball teams, with the chance of landing national championships in both sports. UCLA did ultimately garner the 1968 basketball championship. Beban was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1991. He is a charter member of the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame, and the Bruins retired his No. 16 jersey. Although the UCLA football program has turned out a high proportion of successful professional players through the years, Beban remains the only Bruin to win the Heisman. Professional career After graduating from UCLA, Beban was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the second round (30th overall) of the 1968 NFL/AFL draft. He was the third quarterback taken, after Greg Landry and Eldridge Dickey, ahead of Mike Livingston and Ken Stabler. His draft rights were traded to the Washington Redskins on June 14, 1968, after failing to agree to terms on a contract with the Rams, in exchange for a first-round draft pick in 1969 (the Rams used the pick, tenth overall, to select split end Jim Seymour). Beban signed a reported three-year contract worth $200,000 three days later. He played for the Redskins in 1968 and 1969, under new head coach Vince Lombardi. But, sitting behind veteran quarterback and future Hall of Famer Sonny Jurgensen, Beban was given little game time, and the professional stardom portended by his college career was not forthcoming. Released from the Redskins on September 8, 1970, Beban signed with the Denver Broncos after the 1970 season, but was waived on August 5, 1971, and retired from professional football immediately. Later life In 1971, Beban joined the Los Angeles office of CB Richard Ellis, a global real estate services company. Beginning in 1975, he worked to establish offices in the Chicago area. He was named president and general manager of the company in 1985, and in 1998 became senior executive managing director of the company's Global Corporate Services unit. For several years in the 1970s, he also provided unique color commentary for UCLA football telecasts. In 2009, UCLA scheduled a special \\"Throwback Jersey\\" day in Beban's honor for the UCLA- Washington homecoming game at the Rose Bowl, where the team dressed in the powder-blue and white shoulder-stripe jerseys with pure gold helmets (without decals) of UCLA's 1965‚Äì66‚Äì67 seasons, uniforms first devised by the coach Red Sanders for his teams of the 1950s, including the 1954 National Championship team. Fans were able to purchase Beban's number 16 jersey to wear en masse that day.

It is reported within surface weather observations and METAR code either in meters or statute miles, depending upon the country. Visibility affects all forms of traffic: roads, sailing and aviation. Meteorological visibility refers to transparency of air: in dark, meteorological visibility is still the same as in daylight for the same air. Definition Airplane flying into clouds on descent for landing ICAO Annex 3 Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation contains the following definitions and note: :a) the greatest distance at which a black object of suitable dimensions, situated near the ground, can be seen and recognized when observed against a bright background; :b) the greatest distance at which lights of 1,000 candelas can be seen and identified against an unlit background. :Note.‚Äî The two distances have different values in air of a given extinction coefficient, and the latter b) varies with the background illumination. The former a) is represented by the meteorological optical range (MOR). Annex 3 also defines Runway Visual Range (RVR) as: :The range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centre line of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centre line. Foggy morning road On clear days, Tel Aviv's skyline is visible from the Carmel mountains, 80 km north In extremely clean air in Arctic or mountainous areas, the visibility can be up to 240 km (150 miles) where there are large markers such as mountains or high ridges. However, visibility is often reduced somewhat by air pollution and high humidity. Various weather stations report this as haze (dry) or mist (moist). Fog and smoke can reduce visibility to near zero, making driving extremely dangerous. The same can happen in a sandstorm in and near desert areas, or with forest fires. Heavy rain (such as from a thunderstorm) not only causes low visibility, but the inability to brake quickly due to hydroplaning. Blizzards and ground blizzards (blowing snow) are also defined in part by low visibility. Derivation To define visibility the case of a perfectly black object being viewed against a perfectly white background is examined. The visual contrast, CV(x), at a distance x from the black object is defined as the relative difference between the light intensity of the background and the object :C_\\\\text{V}(x) = \\\\frac{F_\\\\text{B}(x) - F(x)}{F_\\\\text{B}(x)} where FB(x) and F(x) are the intensities of the background and the object, respectively. Because the object is assumed to be perfectly black, it must absorb all of the light incident on it. Thus when x=0 (at the object), F(0) = 0 and CV(0) = 1. Between the object and the observer, F(x) is affected by additional light that is scattered into the observer's line of sight and the absorption of light by gases and particles. Light scattered by particles outside of a particular beam may ultimately contribute to the irradiance at the target, a phenomenon known as multiple scattering. Unlike absorbed light, scattered light is not lost from a system. Rather, it can change directions and contribute to other directions. It is only lost from the original beam traveling in one particular direction. The multiple scattering's contribution to the irradiance at x is modified by the individual particle scattering coefficient, the number concentration of particles, and the depth of the beam. The intensity change dF is the result of these effects over a distance dx. Because dx is a measure of the amount of suspended gases and particles, the fraction of F that is diminished is assumed to be proportional to the distance, dx. The fractional reduction in F is :dF = -b_\\\\text{ext} F dx where bext is the attenuation coefficient. The scattering of background light into the observer's line of sight can increase F over the distance dx. This increase is defined as b' FB(x) dx, where b' is a constant. The overall change in intensity is expressed as :dF(x) = \\\\left[b' F_\\\\text{B}(x) - b_\\\\text{ext} F(x)\\\\right] dx Since FB represents the background intensity, it is independent of x by definition. Therefore, :dF_\\\\text{B}(x) = 0 = \\\\left[b' F_\\\\text{B}(x) - b_\\\\text{ext} F_\\\\text{B}(x)\\\\right] dx It is clear from this expression that b' must be equal to bext. Thus, the visual contrast, CV(x), obeys the Beer‚ÄìLambert law :\\\\frac{dC_\\\\text{V}(x)}{dx} = - b_\\\\text{ext} C_\\\\text{V}(x) which means that the contrast decreases exponentially with the distance from the object: :C_\\\\text{V}(x) = \\\\exp(- b_\\\\text{ext} x) Lab experiments have determined that contrast ratios between 0.018 and 0.03 are perceptible under typical daylight viewing conditions. Usually, a contrast ratio of 2% (CV = 0.02) is used to calculate visual range. Plugging this value into the above equation and solving for x produces the following visual range expression (the Koschmieder equation): :x_\\\\text{V} = \\\\frac{3.912}{b_\\\\text{ext}} with xV in units of length. At sea level, the Rayleigh atmosphere has an extinction coefficient of approximately 13.2 √ó 10‚àí6 m‚àí1 at a wavelength of 520 nm. This means that in the cleanest possible atmosphere, visibility is limited to about 296 km. Visibility perception depends on several physical and visual factors. A realistic definition should consider the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is highly sensitive to spatial frequencies, and then to use the Fourier transform and the contrast sensitivity function of the HVS to assess visibility. Fog, mist, haze, and freezing drizzle The international definition of fog is a visibility of less than ; mist is a visibility of between and and haze from to . Fog and mist are generally assumed to be composed principally of water droplets, haze and smoke can be of smaller particle size. This has implications for sensors such as thermal imagers (TI/FLIR) operating in the far-IR at wavelengths of about 10 Œºm, which are better able to penetrate haze and some smokes because their particle size is smaller than the wavelength; the IR radiation is therefore not significantly deflected or absorbed by the particles. With fog, occasional freezing drizzle and snow can occur. This usually occurs when temperatures are below . These conditions are hazardous due to ice formation, which can be deadly, particularly so because of the low visibility, which usually accompanies these conditions at under 1000 yards. The combination of low visibility and ice formation can lead to accidents on roadways. These cold weather events are caused largely by low-lying stratus clouds. Very low visibility Visibility of less than is usually reported as zero. In these conditions, roads may be closed, or automatic warning lights and signs may be activated to warn drivers. These have been put in place in certain areas that are subject to repeatedly low visibility, particularly after traffic collisions or pile-ups involving multiple vehicles. Low visibility warnings In addition, an advisory is often issued by a government weather agency for low visibility, such as a dense fog advisory from the U.S. National Weather Service. These generally advise motorists to avoid travel until the fog dissipates or other conditions improve. Airport travel is also often delayed by low visibility, sometimes causing long waits due to approach visibility minimums and the difficulty of safely moving aircraft on the ground in low visibility. Visibility and air pollution A visibility reduction is probably the most apparent symptom of air pollution. Visibility degradation is caused by the absorption and scattering of light by particles and gases in the atmosphere. Absorption of electromagnetic radiation by gases and particles is sometimes the cause of discolorations in the atmosphere but usually does not contribute very significantly to visibility degradation. Scattering by particulates impairs visibility much more readily. Visibility is reduced by significant scattering from particles between an observer and a distant object. The particles scatter light from the sun and the rest of the sky through the line of sight of the observer, thereby decreasing the contrast between the object and the background sky. Particles that are the most effective at reducing visibility (per unit aerosol mass) have diameters in the range of 0.1-1.0 ¬µm. The effect of air molecules on visibility is minor for short visual ranges but must be taken into account for ranges above 30 km.

The Dojeon has been translated into eight languages, including Korean, English, Japanese, German, Spanish, French, Russian and Chinese. Background Over one hundred years ago, Sangjenim (God the Father) was the first in all of Eastern and Western history to proclaim and fully describe the Later Heaven Gaebyeok. The precept of Gaebyeok applies to heaven and earth and to the realms of humanity and spirits, and it answers the mysteries of nature, explains the secrets of civilization, and resolves the limitations of Eastern and Western religions and philosophies. After Sangjenim‚Äôs ascension to heaven, the truth of gaebyeok was widely disseminated by the successor of His Dao lineage and authority, Taemonim (God the Mother). The original Dojeon was published in Korean on October 25, 1992 for the 122nd commemoration of Sangjenim‚Äôs birth, and it entailed twenty years of extensive research and fieldwork by Jeung San Do practitioners as they compiled the written and oral testimonies of Sangjenim‚Äôs and Taemonim‚Äôs disciples, the disciples‚Äô descendants, and the disciples‚Äô students. The publication of the 2003 revised edition took an additional eleven years of effort involving further research and extensive review of old and new testimonials to verify and discover dates, sites, events, and people related to Sangjenim‚Äôs and Taemonim‚Äôs works of renewing heaven and earth. The foreign-language translations of the Dojeon are based mostly on the 1992 Korean edition. Thus, the Dojeon represents thirty years of dedication by many people; it is the culmination of Jeung San Do‚Äôs culture. Content :Those aware of the flow of the world have the qi of life. :Those ignorant of the flow of the world have the qi of death. :Dojeon 5:259:20 Arranged in eleven chapters, the Dojeon spans Sangjenim‚Äôs and Taemonim‚Äôs lives, their work, their disciples, the principle upon which the universe evolves, the ultimate destiny of humanity, the existence of spirits, meditation, the times we live in, the coming civilization, and much more. Through the Dojeon, the reader can begin the process of understanding Jeung San Do‚Äôs Eight Teachings: * Sangjenim (The supreme God) * Cosmology (the way of universe, Cosmic year) * Humanity * Spirits and Meditation (Tae Eul Ju meditation) * The work of renewing heaven and earth (Human history) Â§©Âú∞ÂÖ¨‰∫ã * Autumn Gaebyeok and Salvation * The Subu (Tao Lineage and Authority) * The Ilggun (Workers) of work under heaven The Dojeon records the true path that will allow the people of the world to survive the Later Heaven Gaebyeok and enter the new civilization of immortality. This makes the Dojeon history‚Äôs greatest gift-a sacred text of life, not filled with words of despair and tears, but with a radiant and vivid vision of joy and hope for a future that transcends the limitations of modern civilization. But to appreciate the Dojeon‚Äôs sacred truth, one must first understand Sangjenim and Taemonim.

Nurikabe was apparently invented and named by Nikoli; other names (and attempts at localization) for the puzzle include Cell Structure and Islands in the Stream.  Rules  The puzzle is played on a typically rectangular grid of cells, some of which contain numbers. Cells are initially of unknown color, but can only be black or white. Two same-color cells are considered \\"connected\\" if they are adjacent vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. Connected white cells form \\"islands\\", while connected black cells form the \\"sea\\". The challenge is to paint each cell black or white, subject to the following rules: # Each numbered cell is an island cell, the number in it is the number of cells in that island. # Each island must contain exactly one numbered cell. # There must be only one sea, which is not allowed to contain \\"pools\\", i.e. 2√ó2 areas of black cells. Human solvers typically dot the non-numbered cells they've determined to be certain to belong to an island. Like most other pure- logic puzzles, a unique solution is expected, and a grid containing random numbers is highly unlikely to provide a uniquely solvable Nurikabe puzzle. History Nurikabe was first developed by \\"renin („Çå„Éº„Å´„Çì),\\" whose pen name is the Japanese pronunciation of \\"Lenin\\" and whose autonym can be read as such, in the 33rd issue of (Puzzle Communication) Nikoli at March 1991. It soon created a sensation, and has appeared in all issues of that publication from the 38th to the present. As of 2005, seven books consisting entirely of Nurikabe puzzles have been published by Nikoli. (This paragraph mainly depends on \\"Nikoli complete works of interesting-puzzles(„Éã„Ç≥„É™ „Ç™„É¢„É≠„Éë„Ç∫„É´Â§ßÂÖ®ÈõÜ).\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20060707011243/http://www.nikoli.co.jp/storage/addition/omopadaizen/) Solution methods Solution to the example puzzle given above No blind guessing should be required to solve a Nurikabe puzzle. Rather, a series of simple procedures and rules can be developed and followed, assuming the solver is sufficiently observant to find where to apply them. The greatest mistake made by beginning solvers is to concentrate solely on determining black or white and not the other; most Nurikabe puzzles require going back and forth. Marking white cells may force other cells to be black lest a section of black be isolated, and vice versa. (Those familiar with Go can think of undetermined cells next to various regions as \\"liberties\\" and apply \\"atari\\" logic to determine how they must grow.) =Basic strategy= A Nurikabe puzzle being solved by a human. Dots represent the cells that are known to be white. * Since two islands may only touch at corners, cells between two partial islands (numbers and adjacent white cells that don't total their numbers yet) must be black. This is often a way to start a Nurikabe puzzle, by marking cells adjacent to two or more numbers as black. * Once an island is \\"complete\\"--that is, it has all the white cells its number requires--all cells that share a side with it must be black. Obviously, any cells marked with '1' at the outset are complete islands unto themselves, and can be isolated with black at the beginning. * Whenever three black cells form an \\"elbow\\"--an L-shape--the cell in the bend (diagonally in from the corner of the L) must be white. (The alternative is a \\"pool\\", for lack of a better term.) * All black cells must eventually be connected. If there is a black region with only one possible way to connect to the rest of the board, the sole connecting pathway must be black. ** Corollary: there cannot be a continuous path, using either vertical, horizontal or diagonal steps, of white cells from one cell lying on the edge of the board to a different cell like that, that encloses some black cells inside, because otherwise, the black cells won't be connected. * All white cells must eventually be part of exactly one island. If there is a white region that does not contain a number, and there is only one possible way for it to connect to a numbered white region, the sole connecting pathway must be white. * Some puzzles will require the location of \\"unreachables\\"--cells that cannot be connected to any number, being either too far away from all of them or blocked by other numbers. Such cells must be black. Often, these cells will have only one route of connection to other black cells or will form an elbow whose required white cell (see previous bullet) can only reach one number, allowing further progress. =Advanced strategy= An example of the third advanced strategy The cell diagonally between the two islands has to be black. * If there is a square consisting of two black cells and two unknown cells, at least one of the two unknown cells must remain white according to the rules. Thus, if one of those two unknown cells (call it 'A') can only be connected to a numbered square by way of the other one (call it 'B'), then B must necessarily be white (and A may or may not be white). * If an island of size N already has N-1 white cells identified, and there are only two remaining cells to choose from, and those two cells touch at their corners, then the cell between those two that is on the far side of the island must be black. * If a square must be white and only two islands can connect to it and have no unidentified cells left after connecting, then if the islands connect at a 90 degree angle (ex: One island can connect to the top side and the other to the right side) the cell inside the angle (The one touching the top-left corner of the white square in the previous example) must be black to avoid connecting the 2 islands. * Undetermined cells adjacent to a straight row (or a straight column) of black cells can be tested for being black, because if they are black it will form two elbows, and there will be two adjacent white cells which need to be reachable from the islands. If they can not be fulfilled within the constraints, it means the cell that was probed for blackness must be white.  Computational Complexity  It is NP-complete to solve Nurikabe, even when the involved numbers are 1 and 2 only. Further, consider these two rules of Nurikabe: # Black cells form a connected area # Black cells cannot form 2 √ó 2 squares, Either one can be ignored, giving a total of three variants. As it turns out, they are all NP-complete. Related Puzzles Example of a 7x8 Mochikoro puzzle.Solution to the previous puzzle. The binary determination puzzles LITS and Mochikoro, also published by Nikoli, are similar to Nurikabe and employ similar solution methods. The binary determination puzzle Atsumari is similar to Nurikabe but based upon a hexagonal tiling rather than a square tiling. Mochikoro is a variant of the Nurikabe puzzle: # Each numbered cell belongs to a white area, the number indicates how many cells belong to the white area. Some white areas may not include a numbered cell. # All white areas must be diagonally connected. # The black cell must not cover an area of 2x2 cells or larger.

Stutz, guitarist Johnny Sughrue and drummer Terry Casper had known each other since high school and had been playing music together as a trio. Peggy Hambright, who was Stutz's and Sughrue‚Äôs roommate at the time, joined the band, contributing keyboards, violin and vocals.Cumberland Avenue Revisited: Four Decades of Music From Knoxville. Edited by Jack Renfro. Cardinal Publishing (2003) The Judybats played locally to large audiences before signing to Sire Records in 1990. The band took their name from a song written by a friend of theirs, which contained the line \\"punch me with a judybat,\\" a punning allusion to Punch and Judy shows. The official form of the band's name was never entirely clear ‚Äî although the band was credited as \\"The Judybats\\" on the cover of their first album, Native Son, all of their subsequent albums listed the band's name as just \\"Judybats,\\" or sometimes \\"JudyBats,\\" although several CD singles from the later albums retained the word \\"The.\\" Sire Records era The band's first major release was a cover of The 13th Floor Elevators' \\"She Lives (In a Time of Her Own),\\" which appeared on Sire's Roky Erickson tribute album, Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye, in 1990. The song also appeared on the band's debut album, Native Son, released the following year, and the accompanying tour saw the band opening for the likes of R.E.M. on May 9, 1991 at the Georgia Theatre in Athens, GA. Casper subsequently left the band and was temporarily replaced by session drummer Kevin Jarvis on their second album, Down in the Shacks Where the Satellite Dishes Grow, in 1992. Following that album, Hambright and Stutz both left the band, and were replaced by Paul Noe on bass and David Jenkins on drums. The revised lineup released the band's most commercially successful album, Pain Makes You Beautiful, in 1993, and had successful singles on college radio and adult album alternative stations with \\"Being Simple,\\" \\"All Day Afternoon\\" and \\"Incredible Bittersweet.\\" The lineup remained stable for the band's fourth album, 1994's Full-Empty. Heiskell had intended the album to be produced by Mitchell Froom and even sent him a demo tape of new songs, but was told by the Judybats' manager that attempts to reach Froom had been fruitless. Instead, the band opted to work with producer Paul Mahern, both because \\"he was cheap\\" and \\"was also supposed to have some kind of indie cachet at that time.\\" While recording Full-Empty, Heiskell eventually received a phone call from Froom, who said he liked the songs and expressed interest in working with the band, only to be told they were already working with Mahern. The band promoted the album by appearing on Late Night With Conan O'Brien on October 4, 1994, performing \\"Sorry Counts.\\" In an interview with The Advocate the following month, Heiskell acknowledged that he was gay\\"'Bats Man: Jeff Heiskell, lead singer of the Judybats, comes out from behind his lyrics\\". The Advocate, November 15, 1994., but otherwise rarely discussed his sexuality with the press, choosing to write about it only indirectly in his songs until his solo career. Full-Empty fared poorly on the charts and the band broke up soon afterward. In a 2008 interview with Popdose, Jeff Heiskell claimed that his dissolution of the band was attributable to several factors, with the last tour being \\"a nightmare of panic attacks and depression.\\" Heiskell had been writing a screenplay about his experiences as a teenager that rendered him \\"an emotional wreck for nearly two years.\\" Moreover, Heiskell alleged that band members Paul Noe and David Jenkins had attempted to convince him to break up the Judybats and form a new band with them. Heiskell explained, \\"By the time the tour ended I weighed 157 pounds ‚Äì I‚Äôm nearly six feet tall ‚Äì and could scarcely go out during the day for fear of having a bout of serious anxiety.\\" Additionally, Warner Bros. decided to cull their roster of artists, which saw the Judybats losing their contract. \\"The idea of running about playing shows for schmucks in an attempt to get signed again made me break out in a sweat just thinking about it. And I was convinced that my life had become nothing more than trying to write the next college radio jingle of the week.\\" Post- Sire era Heiskell, Noe and Jenkins, along with guitarist Reed Pendleton, pursued a new musical direction under the name Doubters Club, an informal reconfiguration of the Judybats. They released the album Fleur de Lisa independently in 1996, after being dropped from a development deal with Sire Records.\\"No Doubt: Rising from the pretty pop ashes of the Judybats, the Doubters Club is ready to flex some musical muscle\\". Metro Pulse, July 25, 1996. Heiskell later claimed that, following the release of the album, \\"Dave and Paul moved off to Nashville, hiding from me the fact that they had started another band on the side, taking all of the equipment with them.\\" After the Doubters Club dissolved, Heiskell seriously considered quitting the music industry, while Pendleton encouraged Jeff to stay the course. Reed's effect- layered guitar riffs paired well with Heiskell's lyrics, and soon a series of weekend songwriting sessions led to Heiskell and Pendleton creating new songs, including \\"Break My Heart,\\" \\"Shine,\\" \\"You're Too Much,\\" \\"Full Forward Angel,\\" \\"Always,\\" \\"Love Will Out\\" and \\"California.\\" Moving forward, Heiskell and Pendleton formed the band Shoho, Jeff's nickname for local \\"scenesters\\" that often attended the band's shows. The lineup consisted of Heiskell on vocals and Pendleton on guitar, joined by local bassist Rob Bell and a set of twin brothers: guitarist/fiddle player Doug Hairrell and drummer Mike Hairrell. Early band sessions were held in a remote log cabin south of Knoxville, where the new lineup developed a guitar-heavy sound with Brit-Pop influences. Upon the insistence of new manager SuperFrank, the band settled on resurrecting the name Judybats for the project. This incarnation of the band issued one album, Judybats '00, in 2000, and released a cover of Paul McCartney's \\"Love in Song\\" for the 2001 McCartney tribute album Listen to What the Man Said. \\"Break My Heart\\" was also included in Oxford American's annual Southern Music issue. In 2005, another configuration of Judybats performed at the Halsted Market Days Festival in Chicago. In 2011, the Judybats '00 track \\"California\\" appeared on the compilation album Kat Vox: Celebrating 20 Years of Timmi-Kat Records. Post-Judybats Jeff Heiskell has since released five solo albums, under the name Heiskell: Soundtrack for an Aneurism (2007), Clip-On Nose Ring (2008), Arriving (2015), Emotional Terrorism (2017) and Songs in the Key of H (2019). Emotional Terrorism was accompanied by two videos, for the songs \\"Still Life With Broken Heart\\" and \\"I Want More Life.\\" Conceived by Heiskell himself, both were guided by videographer Douglas Stuart McDaniel\\"Rockin' Out Interview: The Judybats' Jeff Heiskell\\". Spinner, June 27, 2008., with intern Tyler Ju√°rez Dippel shooting the footage for \\"Still Life With Broken Heart.\\" \\"I did not feel comfortable carrying on the Judybats name with my being the only member\\", Heiskell explained in 2008. \\"I didn‚Äôt really feel that comfortable with it when the ‚Äô00 record was released, either. A millionaire control freak backed that project financially, so I felt that I had to follow his lead. I follow no one's lead now.\\" In 2016, Heiskell performed several Judybats songs at Waynestock, a benefit concert for Girls Rock Camp Knoxville. In 1992, former keyboardist Peggy Hambright founded Magpies Bakery in Knoxville, Tennessee, and was owner until 2018, when she passed the business onto her niece, Elizabeth. In the fall of 2015, former bassist Tim Stutz released music via Bandcamp, under the name Because of Robots (stylized as \\"because of robots\\").

Aurela was a charter airline based in Vilnius, Lithuania. It operated charter services for several tour operators in the Baltic states. Its main base was Vilnius International Airport.Flight International, 27 March 2007  History  The airline was established and started operations in 1996 as a joint-stock air company using a Tupolev Tu-134A. In 1995 Aurela Airlines became the first private aviation company in Lithuania. In 1996 the company acquired a VIP configured aircraft, a TU-134A for charter flights. In 2001 an eight-seater business class plane, Hawker HS-125-700, was purchased for VIP flights. Further demand on the market for chartered flights allowed the Company to take a loan on a newer and more economical YAK-42D containing 120 seats. In 2003 as the number of charter flights increased, the Company rented out another YAK-42D. In 2004 one YAK-42D was replaced with a more advanced and higher volume Boeing 737-300. The first flight of this plane coincided with Lithuania's membership in the European Community. Aurela was also used by Valdas Adamkus, the President of Lithuania. In 2004-2005 the President was taken to Kiev during the Orange Revolution and to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II. In 2005 as soon as the EU had tightened its position in respects to the use of Russian aircraft, the company updated its fleet by acquiring western manufactured planes. In December, upon expiration of the rent agreement, the remaining YAK-42D was returned to the lessor. In July 2006 a second Boeing 737-300 was rented out. In December the Company's shareholders purchased a brand new nine-seater plane, a Hawker 850XP for VIP charter flights. That same year the key client for chartered flights had become Novaturas Travel Company. In spring 2009 Aurela announced plans to expand its aircraft fleet by acquiring a Boeing 767-200. Aurela have signed a three-year contract with Thomas Cook airlines to provide them with Boeing 757-200 aircraft for summer months at its UK bases, and provides a charter service for Small Planet Airlines to Samos island and Limnos. In 2012, Aurela began to operate several routes for Monarch Airlines due to Monarch opening new routes and not having sufficient fleet. Routes such as Birmingham to M√°laga. Monarch ceased their partnership with Aurela in September 2012 due to extensive delays, customer complaints and an Aurela aircraft skidding off the runway at Birmingham Airport. On 18 February 2013, the decision was taken by the Lithuanian CAA to suspend the licence of Aurela.Aurela License Suspended  Services  The core activities were: * Regular charter Flights - one of the key operational activities by Aurela was travel agencies chartered flights to different resorts in Europe, Asia and Africa. * Individual charter Flights - Aurela Airlines organizes individual or so-called exclusive charter flights. * ACMI Lease - Aurela provided aircraft with all maintenance and crew including engineers to a lessee. In 2006 Aurela had a successful cooperation with Estonian Air. One of the aircraft was leased to the Estonian company for three and a half months.

He was capped 18 times for England. Career =Manchester United= Greenhoff was born in Barnsley, and as a youngster played for Yorkshire Schoolboys. He joined Manchester United as a youth player in August 1968, and made his first-team debut against Ipswich Town on 8 September 1973. He helped Manchester United win the 1977 FA Cup, by which time he had developed a partnership with Martin Buchan in central defence. He was very versatile, starting his career as a midfielder and finishing it as a centre back of international class. Greenhoff scored 17 goals in his Manchester United career and played 271 games between 1973 and 1979. His brother, Jimmy, also played for Manchester United. Greenhoff was brought to Manchester United as one of the last of the Busby Babes, scouted by Joe Armstrong - his childhood affinity with United, due to Barnsley born Tommy Taylor starring, played a huge role in persuading him to join the European Champions despite interest from the more local club Rotherham United, managed by Tommy Docherty. A succession of injuries prevented him from making his debut as a teenager until Docherty took over at Old Trafford. Upon greeting Greenhoff, Tommy exclaimed, \\"I've got you at last. The long way round, but I've got you at last.\\" Following his debut at Portman Road, Greenhoff was essentially an ever- present, one of the most vital components of Docherty's exciting young team. Despite relegation in the 1973/74 season, Greenhoff's performances had been one of the few plusses, causing him to be named the Supporters Player of the Season. Though used more often in midfield, Greenhoff was more comfortable playing at centre half - due to his talent on the ball and willingness to work hard for the team, he ended up being played in every position for the United first team - including in goal, when Alex Stepney was injured in a game at Birmingham City. Eventually Greenhoff was moved back into his preferred centre half position - by accident, according to Docherty, as his team were chasing a goal in a cup tie - and the modern United centre half was born. Disappointment in the 1976 FA Cup Final, where the image of a tearful Greenhoff being consoled by his manager became an iconic one, was followed by the best season of the player's career in 1976‚Äì77. A man of the match performance against Ajax in the UEFA Cup came in a strong start to the season, where he also became a regular at the heart of the defence in the England national team. In the 1977 FA Cup Final, it is commonly agreed that Greenhoff was the man of the match. =Leeds United= Greenhoff left for Leeds United in 1979 for ¬£350,000, which at the time was a record transfer for anyone leaving Manchester United. He was given a free transfer when Leeds were relegated in 1982. During his time with Leeds there had been concerns expressed about his weight. He returned to the game as player-coach at Rochdale after his brother had been appointed player- manager in 1983. He left the club when Jimmy was sacked in March 1984 but stayed in the area. International career He won 18 caps for England, and appeared once for England B. Greenhoff played four times for the England under 23 team, scoring once and made his debut for England on 8 May 1976 in a 1‚Äì0 win at Ninian Park, Cardiff against Wales. His last game came on 31 May 1980 in a friendly against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney. Non- League football Following his retirement from the professional game, Brian coached semi-professionally at a local level and was also able to dedicate some time to his other sporting love, cricket, at a semi-professional level for Norden. His match-winning exploits in a local rivalry game against Heywood made the local press. Retirement After his retirement altogether from playing sports, Greenhoff was regularly seen in the media giving his thoughts on Manchester United. In 2012, he released his autobiography, \\"GREENHOFF!\\" with the title dedicated to the chant that was given to him by the Stretford End. Death On 22 May 2013, Greenhoff died at his home in Rochdale, England.

It consists of one or more integrators, connected in some feedback configuration. The most common implementation sums the input signal with its integral and its double integral.  Kerwin-Huelsman-Newcomb (KHN) Biquad Filter Example  The example given below can produce simultaneous lowpass, highpass and bandpass outputs from a single input. This is a second-order (biquad) filter. Its derivation comes from rearranging a high-pass filter's transfer function, which is the ratio of two quadratic functions. The rearrangement reveals that one signal is the sum of integrated copies of another. That is, the rearrangement reveals a state variable filter structure. By using different states as outputs, different kinds of filters can be produced. In more general state variable filter examples, additional filter orders are possible with more integrators (i.e., more states). Schematic for a state variable filter The signal input is marked Vin; the LP, HP and BP outputs give the lowpass, highpass and bandpass filtered signals respectively.The Bifet Design Manual, Texas Instruments, 1980Introduction to Operational Amplifier Theory and Applications, Wiate, Huelsman & Korn, McGraw Hill,1975 For simplicity, we set: R_{f1} = R_{f2} C_1 = C_2 R_1=R_2 Then: F_0 = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi R_{f1}C_1} Q = \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{R_4}{R_q}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2+\\\\frac{R_1}{R_g}}\\\\right) The pass-band gain for the LP and HP outputs is given by: A_{HP} = A_{LP} = \\\\frac{R_1}{R_G} It can be seen that the frequency of operation and the Q factor can be varied independently. This and the ability to switch between different filter responses make the state-variable filter widely used in analogue synthesizers. Values for a resonance frequency of 1 kHz are Rf1 = Rf2 = 10k, C1 = C2 = 15nF and R1 = R2 = 10k Applications State variable filters are frequently used for modifying frequency response in audio signal processing. At low Q settings they are often used in parametric equaliser circuits, and at high or variable Q settings to create resonant filter modules in analog synthesizers. For manual control of frequency, R1 and R2 in the section above may be replaced by a dual potentiometer; and for voltage control, the devices U2 and U3 may be replaced by voltage controlled amplifiers or operational transconductance amplifiers.

He is best known for his career with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), where he was an ECW Triple Crown Champion. He is also known for innovating the notable three- quarter facelock jawbreaker, which he called Whipper-Snapper and was later used by Stone Cold Steve Austin, who popularized the move by the name Stone Cold Stunner by using his right arm instead of Mikey Whipwreck's left. Whipwreck is a former world champion, winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship once. He also became a two-time World Television Champion and a three-time World Tag Team Champion in ECW. Watson began his professional wrestling career in ECW in 1994 and received the push of an underdog, who quickly captured the Television Championship, his first title in the company. He would later form an on-and-off partnership with Cactus Jack, with whom he held the World Tag Team Championship twice between 1994 and 1996. A year later, Whipwreck captured the World Heavyweight Championship at age 22 and became the youngest ECW World Heavyweight Champion. He would compete as a mid- carder in the company before leaving in 1998 but returned to the company in late 1999 after a short stint with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Shortly after his return, Whipwreck aligned with The Sinister Minister and formed a tag team with Yoshihiro Tajiri called The Unholy Alliance and won his third World Tag Team Championship with Tajiri. The team existed until ECW's closure in 2001. Since October 28, 2018, Whipwreck along with Jerry Lynn and Mike Freland, started and co-hosts a podcast named Front Row Material Professional wrestling career =Eastern / Extreme Championship Wrestling=  Training and debut (1993-1994)  Before becoming a professional wrestler, Watson joined Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) as a part of their ring crew, who would usually work for free as long as they could have fun in the ring themselves before and after shows had finished. Joey Styles suggested to ECW booker Paul Heyman to check him after watching Watson practice a variety of aerial maneuvers before a live show began. He was hired in ECW after being asked by Heyman to wrestle in the company. Watson was trained by future tag team partner Mick Foley and made his debut under the ring name Mikey Whipwreck on the February 1, 1994 episode of NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling, where he teamed with Keith Shearer in a tag team match against Kevin Sullivan and The Tazmaniac. Whipwreck continued to make appearances as an enhancement talent for the next three months on Eastern Championship Wrestling.  Championship reigns (1994-1996)  On the May 17 episode of Eastern Championship Wrestling, Whipwreck defeated The Pitbull to win the World Television Championship, his first title in ECW. Whipwreck was heavily pushed upon his debut as a fan favorite underdog character. He made his first televised title defense against Kevin Sullivan on the May 24 episode of Eastern Championship Wrestling, where Whipwreck won by disqualification. He made a successful title defense against 911 by disqualification at When Worlds Collide. Whipwreck soon entered a feud with Jason after Jason interfered in Whipwreck's title defenses against Rockin' Rebel at Hostile City Showdown and Chad Austin at Heat Wave and assaulted him during his matches. Whipwreck dropped the World Television Championship to Jason in a no disqualification match at the Hardcore Heaven event on August 13 when The Pitbulls attacked Whipwreck. Two weeks later, at the NWA World Title Tournament, Whipwreck substituted for Terry Funk and won the World Tag Team Championship with Cactus Jack by defeating The Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock). The duo held the titles until November to Remember, where they lost the titles back to Public Enemy. Whipwreck closed the year with a win over Don E. Allen at Holiday Hell in December. He was named the Rookie of the Year by Wrestling Observer Newsletter in 1994. Whipwreck continued his rivalry with Jason in early 1995 and formed a tag team with Hack Meyers. Whipwreck and Meyers lost to Jason and Paul Lauria in a tag team match at Return of the Funker on February 25. The duo soon began a feud with Raven's Nest after Whipwreck defeated Stevie Richards at Hostile City Showdown. Whipwreck joined forces with Raven's Nest rival Tommy Dreamer to take on Raven and Stevie Richards in a tag team match at Enter Sandman, which Whipwreck's team lost. Whipwreck began to ascend the ranks, while also expanding his moveset in the meantime. He received his first major main event push on the August 1 episode of Hardcore TV when he won a battle royal by lastly eliminating Marty Jannetty to become the #1 contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. Later that night, he was unsuccessful in his title shot against The Sandman. Whipwreck began feuding with Sandman over the title. He defeated Sandman in a Singapore cane match at Wrestlepalooza. At Gangstas Paradise, Whipwreck teamed with Public Enemy against Sandman, New Jack and 2 Cold Scorpio in a Gangstas Paradise match, which Whipwreck's team won. On the October 31 episode of Hardcore TV, Whipwreck defeated Sandman in a ladder match to win the World Heavyweight Championship, becoming the youngest world champion in professional wrestling history and a Triple Crown Champion in ECW. Whipwreck successfully defended the title against Steve Austin at November to Remember. At December to Dismember on December 9, Whipwreck defended the title against Sandman and Austin in a three-way dance, where Whipwreck was the first to be eliminated by Austin. Sandman won the title. Watson continued his championship success at the Holiday Hell Tour on December 29, when he defeated 2 Cold Scorpio in a Winner Takes All match to win Scorpio's World Television Championship and the World Tag Team Championship (which Scorpio held with Sandman), with assistance by former tag team partner Cactus Jack, who delivered a double underhook DDT to Scorpio and put Whipwreck on top of him for the pinfall. Whipwreck was dissatisfied with the title win but Jack chose himself as Whipwreck's other half of the World Tag Team Champions. Whipwreck lost the World Television Championship back to Scorpio at House Party on January 5, 1996, after interference by Raven. Whipwreck and Cactus were unable to maintain a successful partnership due to Cactus's dirty tactics. The duo dropped the World Tag Team Championship to The Eliminators (Perry Saturn and John Kronus) in February 1996 at Big Apple Blizzard Blast. After the match, Cactus turned on Whipwreck with the aid of Raven and Whipwreck began feuding with Cactus. At CyberSlam, Whipwreck cost Cactus, a match against Shane Douglas, setting a match between the former tag team partners at Big Ass Extreme Bash, which would turn out to be Cactus' farewell match in the company. Whipwreck was defeated following several chair shots and a piledriver.  Various feuds (1996-1998)  At CyberSlam, Whipwreck began a new angle with Taz by picking up a fight with him after Taz continued to assault his defeated opponent Joel Hartgood after the match, but Whipwreck was taken down with a Tazmission. Whipwreck lost to Taz in a series of matches including one at Big Ass Extreme Bash on March 8. At Heat Wave, Whipwreck attempted to regain the ECW World Tag Team Championship from The Eliminators with Sabu as his partner but failed to win the titles. He captured the European Wrestling Association (EWA) European Junior Heavyweight Championship on August 2 by defeating The Dirt Bike Kid and appeared with the belt on ECW television until losing it to Sabu at London, England in December. Whipwreck appeared on the February 24, 1997 episode of Monday Night Raw, emanating from ECW's home arena Manhattan Center where he lost to Taz as part of an angle between ECW and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He took a hiatus from ECW for the next few months until returning to television on the May 29 episode of Hardcore TV, where he and Spike Dudley lost to Big Dick Dudley and D-Von Dudley. Whipwreck and Dudley began teaming together and got involved in a feud with PG-13. Whipwreck and Dudley lost to PG-13 at the Orgy of Violence event but defeated PG-13 and Whipwreck's longtime rival Jason in a handicap match at July's Heat Wave pay-per-view. Whipwreck was next placed in a rivalry with the undefeated newcomer Justin Credible, who was being managed by Jason. Whipwreck faced Credible in a match at November to Remember, which Whipwreck won by pinning him after a Whipper- Snapper, ending Credible's televised winning streak. Whipwreck disappeared from television and returned at the Living Dangerously pay-per-view on March 1, 1998, where he helped Tommy Dreamer in beating Credible. Whipwreck lost to Credible in a rematch at May's Wrestlepalooza. He competed against Rob Van Dam for the ECW World Television Championship at It Ain't Seinfeld, where the match ended in a no contest after Sabu interfered and attacked Van Dam. Whipwreck would then compete against Sabu in a series of matches throughout the year. His last rivalry in the company was against Jerry Lynn. He defeated Lynn in the opening match of UltraClash on September 19. His last televised match in ECW was a loss to Lynn on the December 17 episode of Hardcore TV. =World Championship Wrestling (1999)= Watson left ECW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in late 1998. He made his surprise WCW debut at the Uncensored pay-per-view in March 1999, unsuccessfully challenging Billy Kidman for the Cruiserweight Championship. He made only three more pay-per- view appearances. He would lose to Scotty Riggs at Spring Stampede and Van Hammer at The Great American Bash. His final WCW pay-per-view match was a Junkyard Invitational at Bash at the Beach. He left WCW after several months, disillusioned by his lack of a push. While in WCW, he generally wrestled in the cruiserweight division or competed against fellow ECW alumni in the hardcore division, which made him have second thoughts about staying in WCW. His last match was a draw against Chase Tatum on the August 23 episode of Monday Nitro. =Return to ECW= Singles competition (1999-2000) Watson returned to the ECW in October 1999, making his televised return to the company on the October 31 episode of Hardcore TV. He was brought back to the company by Lou E. Dangerously and faced Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship but lost. Whipwreck unsuccessfully challenged Rob Van Dam for the World Television Championship on the December 26 Hardcore TV. In 2000, Whipwreck faced C.W. Anderson in a losing effort at Guilty as Charged.  The Unholy Alliance (2000-2001)  Whipwreck competed as a mid-carder, aligning himself with The Sinister Minister, during which his character was changed from a lovable loser to a mad-pyromaniac. During this time, he began competing against lighter wrestlers in the cruiserweight division. He competed in elimination matches at May's Hardcore Heaven and July's Heat Wave pay-per- views. During this time, he frequently feuded with Little Guido and joined forces with Yoshihiro Tajiri. Whipwreck and Tajiri formed a tag team called The Unholy Alliance. The duo entered a tag team tournament for the vacant ECW World Tag Team Championship. They defeated Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke) in the quarter-final round, EZ Money and Julio Dinero in the semi-final round and the teams of Jerry Lynn and Tommy Dreamer and Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger in the final round, a three-way dance to win the vacant titles. Unholy Alliance dropped the belts to Full Blooded Italians on the September 8 episode of ECW on TNN. Unholy Alliance unsuccessfully challenged The FBI for the tag titles at Anarchy Rulz. The duo got another opportunity for the titles at November to Remember, where Whipwreck was injured in the match and was replaced by Super Crazy. This marked the beginning of a brief alliance between Super Crazy and Unholy Alliance, which ended after the trio lost to Hot Commodity (EZ Money, Julio Dinero and Chris Hamrick) in a six-man tag team match on the November 19 episode of Hardcore TV. Unholy Alliance turned on Crazy when Whipwreck helped Tajiri in defeating Crazy in a match by delivering a Whipper-Snapper to Crazy, allowing Tajiri to get the win. The duo became villains in the process. Unholy Alliance began feuding with Crazy and the duo defeated Crazy and his partner Kid Kash in a tag team match at Massacre on 34th Street. Unholy Alliance defeated Crazy and Kash and Full Blooded Italians in a three-way dance at ECW's final pay-per- view Guilty as Charged on January 7, 2001. Unholy Alliance won the match. This was his final match as the company folded down due to bankruptcy after holding its final event on January 13. =Independent circuit and retirement (2001‚Äì2015)= In early 2001, Whipwreck announced his intention to retire in May 2002 if he was not hired by the World Wrestling Federation or BRC in the interim, expressing an interest in pursuing a career in pyrotechnics. By June 11 he had decided to retire by September of that year, as his wrestling style had begun resulting in a number of nagging injuries, including two herniated discs, damaged knees, a damaged right shoulder and a jaw cracked to the point of not even being able to eat hard food. In tribute to Whipwreck, Border City Wrestling hosted \\"The Mikey Whipwreck Retirement Bash\\" on August 29, 2001 at the Cicciaro Club in Windsor, Ontario and featured a number of prominent ECW performers, such as Tommy Dreamer and Sabu. Whipwreck wrestled his American retirement match on October 20, 2001, defeating Little Guido. Whipwreck broke his retirement before long, returning in 2003. He wrestled in several different promotions, such as Ring of Honor, where he would often team with or against some of the wrestlers he has trained. He also made a one-time appearance in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he teamed with The Sandman at one of TNA's weekly pay-per-views against The Gathering (CM Punk and Julio Dinero) in a losing effort. He later appeared at Hardcore Homecoming, ECW reunion tour organized by fellow ECW alum Shane Douglas, in mid-2005. On the Extreme Reunion portion of the tour, he teamed with Chris Chetti to defeat Simon Diamond and C.W. Anderson on June 10. Two days later at the first-ever ECW One Night Stand, Whipwreck, Yoshihiro Tajiri and The Sinister Minister reunited for one night only as Whipwreck and The Minister stood in Tajiri's corner during his three-way dance against Little Guido and Super Crazy. During April 2006, Whipwreck worked as an agent for Liberty States Wrestling. At the second ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view on June 11, 2006, Whipwreck was seen on camera celebrating with other ECW wrestlers after Rob Van Dam won the WWE Championship. On February 21, 2008, in his final New England wrestling appearance, Whipwreck was set to team with The Blue Meanie to challenge for the NECW Tag Team Championship at New England Championship Wrestling's Genesis 8 event in Quincy, Massachusetts, but due to car troubles Whipwreck was unable to attend the event, causing The Blue Meanie to pick a replacement. On September 11, 2010, Whipwreck and Syther defeated Big Time Rush (Tony Burma and Ryan Rush) to win the New York Wrestling Connection Tag Team Championship. On May 24, 2012, Whipwreck made his debut for his former partner, Tajiri's new Wrestling New Classic (WNC) promotion in Tokyo. He teamed with Tajiri in a tag team hardcore match, where they defeated Jado & Gedo. Two days later, Whipwreck and Tajiri defeated Yo-Hey and Yusuke Kodama in another tag team hardcore match in Osaka. Whipwreck's tour of WNC concluded on May 27, when he, Tajiri and Kana were defeated in a six-person main event by Akira, Dave Finlay and Syuri. Whipwreck returned to WNC on August 30, when he, Kana and Tajiri were defeated in a Barbed Wire Board Deathmatch by Akira, StarBuck and Syuri, with Akira pinning Whipwreck for the win. Whipwreck, Kana and Tajiri were also defeated in a rematch the following day in Osaka. On September 1, in the third and final Barbed Wire Board Deathmatch between the two teams, Whipwreck pinned StarBuck to win the match for his team. On March 12, 2015, Watson announced his intention to \\"let Mikey Whipwreck fade into the past\\".http://www.pwinsider.com/article/92246/saying-goodbye-to-mikey- whipwreck.html?p=1 On September 14, 2015, it was announced that Mikey Whipwreck would be a playable character in the WWE 2K16 video game.

The Tibetan Leonardo, 2012, https://www.lionsroar.com/the-tibetan-leonardo/Ringu Tulku, The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet 2007 He was one of the most prominent Tibetan Buddhists of the 19th century and he is credited as one of the founders of the Rim√© movement (non- sectarian), compiling what is known as the \\"Five Great Treasuries\\".Jamgon Kongtrul, Kalu Rinpoche translation group, The Treasury of Knowledge: Book One: Myriad Worlds, Translators' Introduction. He achieved great renown as a scholar and writer, especially among the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages and composed over 90 volumes of Buddhist writing, including his magnum opus, The Treasury of Knowledge. Overview Kongtr√ºl was born in Rongyab (rong rgyab), Kham, then part of the Derge Kingdom.Alexander Gardner, \\"Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye,\\" Treasury of Lives, accessed May 18, 2018, http://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Jamgon-Kongtrul-Lodro-Taye/4358. He was first tonsured at a Bon monastery, and then at 20 became a monk at Shechen, a major Nyingma monastery in the region, later moving on to the Kagyu Palpung monastery in 1833 under the Ninth Tai Situ, Pema Nyinje Wangpo (1775-1853). He studied many fields at Palpung, including Buddhist philosophy, tantra, medicine, architecture, poetics and Sanskrit. By thirty he had received teachings and empowerments from more than sixty masters from the different schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Kongtr√ºl studied and practiced mainly in the Kagyu and Nyingma traditions, including Mahamudra and Dzogchen, but also studied and taught Jonang Kalachakra. He also went on tour with the fourteenth Karmapa and taught him Sanskrit. He became an influential figure in Kham and eastern Tibet, in matters of religion as well as in secular administration and diplomacy. He was influential in saving Palpung monastery when an army from the Tibetan government of Central Tibet occupied Kham in 1865. Kongtr√ºl was affected by the political and inter-religious conflict going on in Tibet during his life and worked together with other influential figures, mainly Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820‚Äì1892) and also with the Nyingma treasure revealer Chogyur Lingpa (1829‚Äì1870) and Ju Mipham Gyatso (1846‚Äì1912). Kongtr√ºl and his colleages worked together to compile, exchange and revive the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings.Schaik, Sam van. Tibet: A History. Yale University Press 2011, page 165-9. This movement came to be named Rim√© (Ris med), ‚Äúnonsectarian,‚Äù or ‚Äúimpartial,‚Äù because it held that there was value in all Buddhist traditions, and all were worthy of study and preservation. According to Sam van Schaik, without this collecting and printing of rare works, the later suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final.Schaik, Sam van. Tibet: A History. Yale University Press 2011, page 169. Jamgon Kongtr√ºl's personal hermitage was Kunzang Dechen Osel Ling (kun bzang bde chen 'od gsal gling), \\"the Garden of Auspicious Bliss and Clear Light\\", and was built on a rocky outcrop above Palpung monastery. It became an important center for the practice of three year retreats. This is also where he composed most of his major works. Kongtr√ºl's works, especially his 10 volume The Treasury of Knowledge. has been very influential, especially in the Kagyu and Nyingma schools.  Philosophy  Besides promoting a general inclusiveness and non- sectarian attitude towards all the different Buddhist lineages and schools, Kongtr√ºl was known to promote a shentong view of emptiness as the highest view. His view of Prasangika Madhyamaka is outlined in the following verse from the Treasury of Knowledge: > Conceptual imputations are abandoned; all things are merely designations. > Compounded phenomena are deceptive; nirvana is not deceptive. > The root of samsara is clinging to true existence, which generates the > obscuration of the afflictive emotions. > Since the first three yanas have the same way of seeing reality, there is > only one path of seeing. > All phenomena dissolve such that ones enlightenment only appears for the > perception of others.Ringu Tulku, The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul > the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet 2007, p 211 According to Kongtr√ºl, the difference between prasangika and svatantrika Madhyamaka is: > These schools differ in the way the ultimate view is generated in one's > being. There is no difference in what they assert the ultimate nature to be. > All the great scholars who are unbiased say that both of these schools are > authentic Madhyamaka.Ringu Tulku, The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul > the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet 2007, p 197. Kongtr√ºl also held that \\"Shentong Madhyamaka\\" was a valid form of Madhyamaka, which was also based on the Buddha nature teachings of the third turning and Nagarjuna's \\"Collection of Praises\\".Ringu Tulku, The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet 2007, p 214. For him, this Shentong Madhyamaka is the view which holds that the Ultimate truth, the \\"primordial wisdom nature, the dharmata\\": > always exists in its own nature and never changes, so it is never empty of > its own nature and it is there all the time.Ringu Tulku, The Ri-me > Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of > Tibet 2007, p 219. However, he makes it clear that \\"The Shentong view is free of the fault of saying that the ultimate is an entity.\\"Ringu Tulku, The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet 2007, p 223. Furthermore, Kongtr√ºl states: > The ultimate truth is the primordial wisdom of emptiness free of > elaborations. Primordial wisdom is there in its very nature and is present > within the impure, mistaken consciousness. Even while consciousness is > temporarily stained, it remains in the wisdom nature. The defilements are > separable and can be abandoned because they are not the true nature. > Therefore, the ultimate truth is also free of the two extremes of nihilism > and eternalism. Since emptiness is truly established, then the extreme of > nihilism is avoided; and since all phenomena and concepts of subject-object > grasping do not truly exist, then the extreme of eternalism is avoided. Finally, on the difference between Rangtong and Shentong, Kongtr√ºl writes in the Treasury of Knowledge: > For both Rangtong and Shentong the relative level is empty, and in > meditation, all fabricated extremes have ceased. However, they differ in > their terminology about whether dharmata is there or not there in post- > meditation, and in the ultimate analysis, whether primordial wisdom is truly > established or not. Shentong says that if the ultimate truth had no > established nature and was a mere absolute negation, then it would be a > vacuous nothingness. Instead, the ultimate is nondual, self-aware primordial > wisdom. Shentong presents a profound view which joins the sutras and > tantras.Ringu Tulku, The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A > Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet 2007, p 226. Works by Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl Lodr√∂ Thay√© The main corpus of Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl Lodr√∂ Thaye vast scholarly activities (comprising more than ninety volumes of works in all) is known as the Great Treasuries: *The Treasury of Encyclopedic Knowledge ('), summarizing the entire sutric and tantric paths. *The Treasury of Precious Instructions ('), a compendium of empowerments and oral instructions of what he formulated as the \\"Eight Great Chariots\\" of the instruction lineages in Tibet. *The Treasury of Kagy√º Mantras ('), a compendium of rituals, empowerments and oral instructions for the Yangdak, Vajrakilaya and Yamantaka deities of the Nyingma kama tradition, and the tantra cycles from the Sarma lineages of Marpa and Ngok. *The Treasury of Precious Termas ('), a massive compilation of termas. *The Uncommon Treasury ('), which contains Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl Lodr√∂ Thaye's own profound terma revelations. *The Treasury of Extensive Teachings ('), which includes various related works, such as praises and advice, as well as compositions on medicine, science and so on. =The Treasury of Knowledge= Jamgon Kongtrul's (1813‚Äì1899) 'The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge' () consists of ten books or sections and is itself a commentary on the root verses 'The Encompassment of All Knowledge' () which is also the work of Jamgon Kongtrul.Kongtrul Lodro Taye (author, compiler); Kalu Rinpoche Translation Group (translators) (1995, 2003).

(restricted circulation) Tulkus There have been several recognized tulkus (incarnations) of Lodro Thaye. =The Second Jamgon Kongtrul (1902‚Äì1952)= The biography of Khakyab Dorje, 15th Karmapa Lama mentions he had a vision in which he saw 25 simultaneous emanations of the master Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl. Preeminent among these was Kars√© Kongtr√ºl (, 1904‚Äì10 May 1952). Kars√© Kongtr√ºl was born as the son of the 15th Karmapa: Kars√© means \\"son of the Karmapa\\". His formal religious name was as Jamyang Khyents√© √ñzer (). Kars√© Kongtr√ºl was identified and enthroned by his father at age twelve in 1902, in Samdrub Choling at the monastery of Dowolung Tsurphu. Kars√© Kongtr√ºl resided at Tsadra Rinchen Drak, the seat of his predecessor in eastern Tibet. He received the full education and lineage transmission from the Karmapa. Among his other teachers were Surmang Trungpa Ch√∂kyi Nyinche, the 10th Trungpa tulku. He attained realization of the ultimate lineage, was one of the most renowned Mahamudra masters and transmitted the innermost teachings to Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa. On many occasions he gave teachings, empowerments, and reading transmissions from the old and new traditions, such as the Treasury of Precious Termas (Rinchen Terdz√∂), and he rebuilt the retreat center of Tsandra Rinchen Drak, his residence at Palpung Monastery. Kars√© Kongtr√ºl died on 10 May 1952 at the age of 49. 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche =3rd Jamgon Kongtrul (1954‚Äì1992)= The 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul, Karma Lodr√∂ Ch√∂kyi Senge,Rigpa Wiki: Jamg√∂n Kongtrul Rinpoche - Rigpa Wiki a tulku of Khyentse √ñzer, was born on 1 October 1954. He fled to India in 1959 in the aftermath of the 1959 Tibetan uprising and grew up at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim under the care of Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa. Following the Karmapa's death, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul was actively involved in the search for the Karmapa‚Äôs successor. On 26 April 1992, a mysterious accidentEnlightened Heart, \\"Tibet's Kagyu Buddhists face a leadership battle\\", 24 March 1999, [describes a possible car cyber attack similar to Michael Hastings' accident], https://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/15/64/Tibet-s-Kagyu-Buddhists-face-a- leadership-battle/ occurred in Darjeeling District, India, with Jamgon Kongtrul as a passenger, when a new BMW veered off the road into a tree, ejecting the engine far away from its motor mount. The accident coincided with the discovery of the 16th Karmapa's prediction letter, but before the search could be completed. Tai Situ Rinpoche, previously working with Jamgon Kongtrul on the search committee, afterwards led the search efforts that found and recognized Ogyen Trinley Dorje five weeks after the accident. =4th Jamgon Kongtrul (1995 to present)= Recognition by 17th Karmapa, Orgyen Trinley Dorje- The 4th Jamgon Kongtrul, Lodro Choyki Nyima Tenpey Dronme, was born in the wood pig year in Central Tibet on the 26th of November 1995. His birth was prophesied by The Seventeenth Karmapa, √ñgyen Trinley Dorje, who also recognised, confirmed the authenticity of his incarnation, and proclaimed it to the world. The prophecy, the search, and the recognition of the Fourth Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche are told in the book E MA HO! published by the Jamgon Kongtrul Labrang and can be obtained from Pullahari Monastery and viewed on www.jamgonkongtrul.org. He spent time between Kagyu Tekchen Ling and Pullahari Monastery, the monastic seats in India and Nepal founded by the Third Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche. Jamgon Kongtrul Labrang gave his studies, training, and the receiving transmissions from the Lineage Masters. Annually, he also attended the Kagyu Monlam in Bodhgaya, India, led by the Seventeenth Gyalwa Karmapa, and led the Kagyu Monlam in Kathmandu, Nepal. On April 14 2016, the Jamgon Yangsi left Pullahari monastery and his monastic vows, stating he wanted to pursue his 'dream of becoming a doctor'. The 4th Jamgon Kongtrul Mingyur Drakpa Senge was born on 17 December, 1995 in Nepal. The day before he was born, the late Chogye Trichen Rinpoche said in front of many Lamas and Tulkus: ‚ÄúLike prophesied ... today Jamgon Rinpoche arrived.‚Äù In 1996, when the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje, arrived in Bodhgaya, when he met the young Jamgon Rinpoche for the first time. Yangsi Rinpoche despite his young age was able to spontaneously pick up some rice and toss it into the air as a mandala offering, Straight away he exclaimed: ‚ÄúThis is the Jamgon Yangsi (Reincarnation) indeed!‚Äù He then issued a recognition letter and gave him a name Karma Migyur Drakpa Senge Trinley Kunkhyab Palzangpo. In 1998, when the Dalai Lama was visiting Bodhgaya, the Yangsi Rinpoche had a private audience with him, where they showed him the recognition letter and the 14th Dalai Lama performed the hair cutting ceremony for the 4th Jamgon Yangsi. In 2000, Drubwang Pema Norbu (Penor Rinpoche), was invited to the Karma Monastery in Bodhgaya, and he performed the vast and profound enthronement ceremony of 4th Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, again reconfirmed Jamgon Yangsi as reincarnation of the great Jamgon Kongtrul. =Other tulkus of Jamg√∂n Kongtrul Lodr√∂ Thaye= In addition to Karsey Kongtrul Khyents√© √ñzer (1904‚Äì1953) (the principal incarnation), there were four other reincarnations of the first Jamgon Kongtrul: Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, Dzogchen Kongtrul Rinpoche, and Shechen Kongtrul Rinpoche. Kalu Rinpoche, also recognized post-facto as the incarnation of Lodr√∂ Thaye's activity, was never enthroned as such. According to the 15th Karmapa, there were 25 simultaneous reincarnations.

It is located at the western edge of the Pur√©pecha highlands, just to the east of the Tierra Caliente region. Since the colonial period, it has been an important city economically due its location. The city was conquered by the Spanish in 1522, when the last Pur√©pecha ruler fled the P√°tzcuaro area to here. The modern city was laid out in 1534 by Friar Juan de San Miguel. It played an important role in the War of Independence, and was the capital of Michoac√°n during the French Intervention. Today it is the center of Mexico's avocado growing region, with most of the crop distributed from here nationally and internationally. The city View of the city from the Cerro de la Charanda. With a population of over 264,000. The city is the second most populous and the second in economic importance in the state of Michoac√°n. The city is located at the western edge of the Pur√©pecha highlands of the state at 1,620 meters above sea level. The city's center has colonial architecture which contain Plateresque and Moorish elements. There are six historic neighborhoods of the city: San Miguel, San Pedro, San Francisco, Santa Maria Magdalena, San Juan Bautista and Santo Santiago, all of which have colonial- era chapels in their centers. Each of these neighborhoods have their own festival: San Jos√© on March 19, El Vergel on the third Friday in June, San Juan Quemado on June 24, San Pedro on June 29, La Magdalena on July 22, Santo Santiago on July 25, San Miguel on September 29, San Francisco de Asis on October 4. The patron saints‚Äô days of these neighborhoods are celebrated with colorful dances such as Los Negritos. Uruapan Plaza The center of the city is marked by the very large and very long Plaza de Martires de Uruapan. Facing this plaza are two commercial portals as well as some of the city's most important landmarks. On the north side, there is the La Huat√°pera Museum, officially called the Museo de los Cuatro Pueblos Indios. Huat√°pera is a Pur√©pecha word, meaning ‚Äúmeeting place,‚Äù and according to tradition, it was built over a pre Hispanic platform, obtaining its social importance from this. Originally the site was a hospital called Hospital Real de la Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n established by Juan de San Miguel in 1533, the first of its kind in the Americas. It functioned not only to heal the sick but also as a center for evangelism and to organize workers by trade.It has a chapel called Santo Entierro, with fine stonework in cantera in Plateresque style. Above the chapel's arch, there is a niche which contains a sculpture of either Francis of Assisi or Juan de San Miguel flanked by the coats of arms of the Franciscans and the Spanish crown. The interior is restored and contains images of angels playing musical instruments and important people from the history of the Catholic Church. The rest of the complex shows Moorish influence and houses a collection of handcrafts from the various indigenous communities of the state. Just to the east of Huat√°pera is the Immaculate Concepci√≥n church, which was built in the late 20th century. It has a cantera portal finished in the 1970s but no cupola nor bell tower. The Casa de Cultura (Cultural Center) is located on the western side of Huat√°pera. It was built in 1992 over what was the Franciscan monastery established by Juan de San Miguel. The original church of this monastery is now the parish church for the city. Built in 1533, it maintains its 16th century Plateresque portal, and the interior of the church has a crucifix that dates from the 18th century. The paintings on the triangular spaces just under the cupola represent salvation and the miracle of the Mass, done by Mohamed Socidel. Behind this line of monuments is a market called the Mercado de Antojitos, whose stalls are dedicated to the sale of prepared traditional foods such as carnitas, barbacoas, quesadillas and the like. The western side of the city is home to the Barranca del Cupatitzio National Park, the second most-visited national park in Mexico. Despite being almost completely surrounded by the city, the park contains trees hundreds of years old, springs, streams, canals and walking paths. The park focuses on the conservation of the ravine which forms the headwaters of the Cupatitzio River, which is fed by various springs and streams starting with the ‚ÄúRodilla del Diablo‚Äù (Devil's Knee) . According to local myth, Juan de San Miguel forced the Devil to bow before the Cross, with the Devil's knee making an indentation in the rock from which the first spring emerges. The land was private until the 1930s when the federal government bought it to create the park. The ravine has various waterfalls such as La Yerbabuena and El Golgota, bridges and fountains that take advantage of natural water supply. There is also a mural called Er√©dira by local artist Manuel P√©rez Coronado, but it is almost completely deteriorated. The San Pedro Factory is a still-operational textile factory built in the late 19th century, when the city was at its industrial peak. Construction of the mill began in 1886, originally to work with cotton but later expanded to other fibers, such as linen and silk. The factory is still in operation but not to the same capacity as in the past. The current owners maintain the more handcrafted feel of the products making bedspreads, tablecloths, napkins and more. Part of the complex is now used for cultural and other events. The city is home to the narrowest house in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Located at 50-C Carrillo Puerto, it measures 1.40 by 7.70 meters. The Palm Sunday Handcraft Market is held during Holy Week with the most important day being Palm Sunday, after which it is named. It covered the city large main square and attracts over a thousand artisans who sell. In addition to traditional observances for Day of the Dead, the city has sponsored the Festival de Velas on the same days, where candles are arranged and lit to form figures at the Martires de Uruapan and Morelos plazas as well as on adjoining streets. There an Avocado Festival from mid November to mid December which consists of exhibitions and cultural events. The city's cuisine is influenced not only by the various ethnic groups in the area but also migration from other parts of Michoacan. Typical dishes include corundas, churipo (a beef and vegetable stew), mutton barbacoa, carnitas, quesadillas with squash flowers, flour tamales, various flavors of sweet and spicy atole, hot chocolate, uchepos, sweet potatoes and plantains cooked in various ways and more. The municipality The city of the Uruapan is the seat of a municipality and serves as the local government for surrounding communities that extend over 954.17km2. Outside of the Uruapan proper, the main communities are Capacuaro, Angahuan, San, Caltzontzin, Jucutacato, Santa, Corupo and Nuevo, all of which are dedicated to agriculture and/or forestry. The municipality borders those of Charapan, Paracho, Nahuatzen, Tingambato, Ziracuaretiro, Taretan, Gabriel Zamora, Nuevo Parangaricutiro, Perib√°n and Los Reyes. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, a syndic, and 12 representatives called regidors. The municipality has a population of over 315,000, of which 18,020 speak an indigenous language, mostly Pur√©pecha. Traditional music is mostly influenced by the Pur√©pecha culture with pirecuas and sons, as well as those played by wind instruments. The El Sabino Zoocriadero is home to various exotic species. It is 17 km outside the city in an area that has a warmer climate. Its main attraction is its crocodiles but it also has lions, badgers, deer, ostriches and turtles. Socioeconomics Since the colonial period, the area has been an agricultural center growing bananas, chicozapote, mamey, limes, oranges, lemons, avocados and more. Today, the city is the second most important economically in the state of Michoac√°n, with a very low level of socioeconomic marginalization. About 12.5% live in extreme poverty, with thirteen communities with about 350 who are extremely marginalized from social services. The city is surrounded by avocado and macadamia orchards. It is located in the most productive regions in Mexico for avocado. It is called the world capital of avocado not because of the production in the municipality but because it is home of six packing companies to which the region sends its avocados for distribution. From here, avocados are shipped all over Mexico and exported to the United States, Central America, Europe and Japan. In 2000, the city made the Guinness Book of World Records creating the largest batch of guacamole, making 1,288 kilograms of the dip, from one ton of fresh avocados. Native to Australia, macadamias have been grown in the Uruapan area since the late 20th century. The city makes a number of products from the nut such as nuts flavored with garlic, chili peppers, soy sauce or salt. They are also made into brittle, cookies, candies and oil. Since the colonial period, the city has been a center of the production of maque, an indigenous form of lacquer, used to wooden items such as plates, platters, boxes, chests and dried gourds. Other handcrafts produced here include masks, papel picado, and textiles. Geography and environment The municipality has a humid subtropical climate (Cwa in the K√∂ppen climate classification) with very wet summers, dry winters and lush forests. It is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and mountainous. Principal peaks include Charanda, La Cruz, Jical√°n and Magdalena. The climate is between temperate and tropical, with most rain falling in the summer. Average annual rainfall is 1,759.3 mm and average annual temperatures are between 8 and 37.5 C. The flora is mostly mixed forest, with pine, oak and deciduous tropical rainforest. Logging includes pine, oak and oyamel fir. Areas without trees mostly consist of scrub of various kinds. Notable fauna includes coyote, skunks, deer, foxes, cacomixtle, hares, opossums, ducks and other birds. The municipality contains numerous small rivers that belongs to the Tepalcatepec basin. The main river is the Cupatitzio. Other important bodies of water include the Caltzontzin Reservoir (also known as the Santa Barbara or Santa Catarina) and waterfalls such as Salto Escondido, Cupatitzio and La Tzar√°racua. The La Tzararacua Ecotourism Center is located 10 km south of the city proper, centered on a 40-meter high waterfall of the same name. Next to this is the Tzararcuita (Little Tzararacua), at 16 meters high. History =Designation= The name comes from the Pur√©pecha word uruapani which means plants that flower and fruit at the same time or those which are always giving fruit. The coat of arms was designed by Luis Valencia Madrigal and represents the history of the area since the pre Hispanic period as well as its natural resources. =Pre Hispanic history= Uruapan was a pre-Hispanic settlement, inhabited primarily by Pur√©pechas. Much of the history is unknown with numerous unexcavated archeological sites. The oldest document about the area is the Lienzo de Jucutacato, found in the community of Jical√°n. It is known that the area was conquered in 1400 by an alliance of the lords of P√°tzcuaro, Tzintzuntzan and Ihuatzio. =Colonial era= When the Spanish invaded the Pur√©pecha Empire, the last ruler fled to Uruapan, leading the Spanish here in 1522. For this reason the Spanish arrived here in 1522. In 1524, the area became an encomienda under Francisco de Villegas and evangelized by the Franciscans. Franciscan friar Juan de San Miguel is considered the founder of the modern city, tracing it out in 1534 into nine neighborhoods, each with its own chapel and patron saint, and assigned who would live in each one. In 1540 the area became an Indian Republic. During the colonial period, the city was a strategic location, especially for commerce, between the Pur√©pecha highlands and the Tierra Caliente leading down to the coast. In 1577 a plague decimated the population. By 1754, the parish of Uruapan consisted of the city of Uruapan, three towns (San Francisco Xical√°n, San Francisco Jucutacato and San Lorenzo) along with two ranches Tiamba and San Marcos along with the Carasa Hacienda. The population was a mix of Pur√©pecha, European, African and mixed races peoples. In 1766, the population revolted against efforts by the Spanish to recruit the population into military service. This was followed by repression and punishment of various persons by execution in 1767, both for the resistance of the prior year and protests against the expulsion of the Jesuits. From 1795 to 1798, insurgent Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos lived here. During the war, the city served as a refuge various times for insurgents, include local Jos√© Mar√≠a Izazaga. =19th century= In 1806, an earthquake destroyed the hospital, and in 1817, the city was burned. Uruapan officially became a municipality in 1831. For its role in the War of Independence, it was named a Ciudad del Progreso (City of Progress) in 1858. In 1842, the city supported the rule of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Because of the French Intervention, the Uruapan was the temporary capital of Michoacan from 1863 to 1867. In 1864, French troops entered and subdued the city. In 1865, General Jos√© Mar√≠a Arteaga, head of the Republican Army and four other officers were executed by firing squad, and are known as the Martyrs of Uruapan. In 1866 the Republicans tried to liberate the city from the French at the Battle of Magdalena but were defeated. The first textile factory was set up in the city in 1874, and the first local newspaper, El Precursor Uruapense was founded in 1880. The first railroad line reached the city in 1899, and a trolley line was built between the rail station and the main plaza in 1900. =20th and 21st centuries= In 1910, a fire destroyed several factories in the city. The city was attacked several times during the Mexican Revolution, the most notable of which were led by Joaqu√≠n Amaro. In the 1930s, efforts to redistribute agricultural land began. In 1947, the Tepalcatepec Commission was created which modernized the area's economy as well as infrastructure. Since the late 20th century, the city has had problems with organized crime, along with much of the rest of the state. Two criminal organizations, Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana, have fought for control here, because of its geographic location among drug routes. In 2014, the city was taken over briefly by the Grupos de Autodefensa Comunitaria or \\"autodefensas\\", an armed civilian movement trying to counter the power of the cartels, unsupported by the local and state government. In August 2019, 19 people were murdered by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.

History  The tower, 175 metres (581 ft) tall , was built in 1934-1935 using spare materials from the construction of the first Little Belt Bridge and opened on 29 May 1935. The tower quickly became a symbol and source of pride of both Odense and the entire island of Funen. Visitors said they could see the entire island from its observation platforms. If this statement is true, it was possible to see more than away. Construction of the tower took 30 tons of steel, 2,700 tons of concrete, and half a million kroner, a considerable amount of money at the time. The tower had two platforms. The first, located 70 metres (230 ft) above ground, was a restaurant featuring a great star-shaped room with low, broad windows, a buffet, and seats for 160 guests. Its roof was decorated with a great compass card with a map of Odense in the centre, surrounded by directions to all towns on the island. Each town was indicated by its direction, name, and coat of arms. A second platform was located 140 metres (460 ft) above ground, with an even greater view. From here, a spiral staircase offered access to the Conch Bar (), the name inspired by the staircase. Tables were located with one on each step of the staircase. The tower's kitchen was suspended beneath the restaurant on the first platform and considered to be very modern. The tower was a popular tourist attraction and in 1935 alone, it attracted more than 213,000 visitors, including many foreigners. It was also a favourite playground for model airplane enthusiasts. The Odin Tower was blown up on 06:15 AM on 14 December 1944 by a group of Danish Nazi saboteurs called the Peter group under the leadership of Henning E. Br√∏ndum, in a so-called act of Schalburgtage. The tower collapsed completely and was damaged beyond repair. It took two months to remove the scrap metal and almost ten years to remove the concrete. On 29 May 2004, the 69th anniversary of the inauguration of the original tower, students of the Odense Technical College (Odense Tekniske Gymnasium) erected a replica of the destroyed tower on its original site.

He also sponsored measures creating a prostate cancer education and research program and encouraging more individuals to enter the nursing profession by giving them an income tax deduction for up to three years. In response to escalating violence at youth sporting events nationwide, Coniglio pushed for a bill allowing municipalities and boards of education to establish athletic codes of conduct for behavior at sporting events. Violators of these codes of conduct can be ejected from games and required to participate in anger management programs before being allowed to return. Coniglio was a prime sponsor of New Jersey's \\"Do Not Call\\" list legislation, one of the strongest telemarketing restricting measure in the nation.

Gaines' eighth novel, published in 1993. While it is a fictional work, it is loosely based on the true story of Willie Francis, a young black man sentenced to death by the electric chair twice in Louisiana, in 1945 and 1947. Plot summary The story begins with the murder of Mr. Grope by two black men. An innocent bystander named Jefferson is charged with and convicted of the murder. He is sentenced to death. In his trial, Jefferson's attorney explains to the jury \\"What justice would there be to take his life? Justice, gentlemen? Why, I would as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this.\\" That statement causes Jefferson to believe that he is indeed a hog, not a man. Jefferson's godmother Miss Emma Glenn, and Tante (Aunt) Lou, the aunt of the local schoolteacher, ask Lou's nephew Grant Wiggins to turn Jefferson from a \\"hog\\" to a \\"man.\\" However, they must first get permission from Sheriff Sam Guidry, who is racist. To accomplish that, they successfully ask Sheriff Guidry's brother-in-law Henri Pichot for assistance. When Grant is not there, Miss Emma, Tante Lou, and Reverend Ambrose also visit Jefferson. Over the course of the novel, Grant and Jefferson form a close friendship. Unusual for the time, Grant also forms a friendship with Deputy Paul Bonin. In early February, it is announced that Jefferson will be executed on April 8. Around then, Reverend Ambrose becomes concerned that Grant, an agnostic, is not teaching Jefferson about God and thus begins visiting him regularly. The conflict reaches a head when Grant buys Jefferson a radio, which the seniors in the black community, or \\"quarter,\\" see as sinful. The novel ends with Jefferson's execution and, much to Grant's surprise, a visit from Paul in which he tells Grant that \\"Jefferson was the strongest man in that crowded room\\" when he was executed. Point of view The reader is given a unique outlook on the status of African Americans in the South after World War II and before the Civil Rights Movement. We see a Jim Crow South through the eyes of a formally educated African American teacher who often feels helpless and alienated from his own country. In \\"A Lesson Before Dying,\\" Grant is the only educated black man in the area and the only member of the black community who might be considered capable of becoming free of overt oppression. Nevertheless, his life and career choices are severely limited and he must refer to white male authority figures as \\"Sir.\\" Because of this, he yearns to leave his disheartening situation. Grant feels that he is cornered by myriad forces: his aunt's incessant wants, pressure to conform to a fundamentalist religion that he does not believe, the children's need for a teacher, and the community's need for leadership. Summed up, Grant can leave and could make a good life for himself if he does, but he doesn't because he feels trapped. Setting =Time period= This book can be dated based on close reading from chapter 12 when the book mentions Jackie Robinson. The quote \\"All three stood talking baseball. Jackie Robinson had just finished his second year with the Brooklyn Dodgers,\\" tells us all that we need to know to date this book. The book takes place in early October 1948. =Plantation= > \\"All there was to see were old white weather-houses, with smoke rising out > of the chimneys and drifting across the corrugated tin roofs overlooking the > yard toward the field, where some of the cane had been cut.

The school that he teaches in is the same place in which the town gathers on Sunday morning for praise and worship. Grant is continually challenged with the fact that he is an outsider in his place of work; he does not attend church with the rest of his settlement. Throughout the entire novel, this school is seen as a place of discrimination. Segregated schools provide another example of racial persecution. Despite Grant's personal atheism, much of the black culture and community focus on religion. This occasionally annoys Grant. =Bayonne= > \\"Bayonne was a small town of about six thousand.

It is especially used by Grant, Jefferson and Reverend Ambrose. The aim of constructive lying is mainly to spare others from pain by keeping the truth from them. When Jefferson talks to Grant with the help of constructive lying this expresses his hopelessness. Another intention of him is to build distance. Another instance of constructive lying can be found between Grant and Miss Emma. Grant deliberately avoids the conversation with Miss Emma to think of a suitable lie first. Furthermore, he cleverly steers the conversation in another direction. During his conversation with Miss Emma after his visit to Jefferson, Grant lies and tries to present Jefferson in a good light. When Grant visits Jefferson, he is displeased because he does not eat the food of his godmother Miss Emma. Knowing that Miss Emma is being in a bad health condition Grant decides not to tell Miss Emma about this incident and rather lie by telling her what she wishes to hear about her godson. These lies can be seen as constructive since they aim to prevent Miss Emma from getting hurt. However, later on, Miss Emma realizes that Grant lied to her because when she visited Jefferson, the picture Grant painted of him did not match reality. Therefore, in retrospective, the constructive lie created more pain than the truth. Grant uses constructive lying to present himself better and thus meet the expectations of others. Finally, Reverend Ambrose appeals to Grant that constructive lying is necessary. He refers to Aunt Lou and lists what she \\"accepted\\" earlier for Grant. = Religion, Cynicism and Hope =  Community and Religion  The church has a great impact on the community. It is not only to integrate a person to be a complete part of the group, but also to define someone's worth. The belief in God strengthens the members of the community and helps them cope with the adversities of life. In addition an early part of the children's life is strongly influenced by religious education in school.  Central Conflict: Grant, Reverend and Jefferson  Even though the teacher Grant Wiggins is not religious, he struggles with the question of what to believe in. His absence at the church on Sundays is not only an act of rebellion, but it also shows an ongoing process of reflection. In the following, it becomes clear that Grant's belief in God and his urge to remain truthful are strongly related to the belief in existence. His sources of hope are the loving relationships within this life. Still, he detects too much injustice and hopelessness to agree with the idea of a universally applicable God. Grant feels trapped by the unjust system of racial discrimination. Therefore, he develops some cynical manners: Instead of seeing the spark of potential, he observes the predetermined future of his students. Still the reader watches Grant grow and realizes that he does teach Jefferson a lot about human dignity and hope that can be found in earthly existence. Reverend Ambrose, in contrast, is described as a simple and devoted believer and embodies a very important member of the quarter. Ambrose finds his hope and drive in religion. Therefore, he is capable to bear not only personal issues but to stand by others in their pain. While this makes him a consistent character, he also stands out due to his lack of criticism against the earthly circumstances. In addition to that, the reverend presents a black-and-white mindset regarding anything opposing his beliefs. Those two opposing characters both influence the young prisoner strongly. While Grant explains earthly concepts of dignity, hope and pride to the living Jefferson, the reverend donates the religious hope for the executed one. The young man manages to combine a strong belief in his worth with confidence in whatever might come. In consequence Jefferson ‚Äútakes the cross‚Äù. =Women and Femininity= Main Feminine Roles Tante Lou Tante Lou is a large black woman in her early to mid-70s. She cared for Grant Wiggins when his parents left him and brought him up as a child. That strengthens her image of a maternal figure. Her best friend is Miss Emma Glenn, the godmother of Jefferson. The two women dress respectfully and try to resist and overcome racism in Bayonne County. Tante Lou finds freedom for her soul in her deeply religious faith in God and the church. Being linked up with this fact, her family is very important to her and her dignity and pride are where she gets her power and motivation from. Although she often says hard, cold words to Grant she loves him like her son and does not want to lose him to another woman. That is why she is very cool towards Vivian (Grant's girlfriend). Tante Lou plays a major role in motivating and guiding Grant. She is the one who demands Grant speaking with the Pichots in order to gain visitation rights at the prison and always wants him to help Jefferson. Therefore, Tante Lou can be seen as a positive force in Grant's life and the community. Tante Lou can be made responsible for Grant's development because she always claims him for being true to himself, knowing that failure to do so would ruin him. She is a powerful and strong woman who is very self-confident. She cannot be influenced very well what makes her a difficult dialogue partner. But in the end, Tante Lou is very important for Grant and his attitude towards Jefferson. Without Tante Lou, the novel would miss one of the most important side protagonists. Miss Emma Glenn Miss Emma is a black woman in her mid-70s. She has grey hair, which is comped up and pinned on top. She is of average height but weighs nearly 200 pounds. Moreover, she has a close relationship with Tante Lou, who supports Miss Emma's plans to ask Mr Pichot's brother-in-law, the sheriff, if Grant is allowed to visit Jefferson in jail. In her past, she worked as a cook for Mr Pichot's family. Miss Emma is a deeply religious, churchgoing woman who wants her godson Jefferson to die like a man, which is why she asks Grant to visit him in jail. She presents herself as determined for achieving her aim. She hopes to get Mr Pichot's help and pursues her goal persistent. Thanks to her stubbornness, Miss Emma gets Mr Pichot's promise that he will try to help her. In public, Miss Emma hides her feelings which you can tell from her behaviour in the courtroom. She seems to be absent-minded and just stares in front of her as if she was ‚Äûa great stone ‚Äú. One can say that Miss Emma is a controlled, strong- willed and dignified woman who pursues her aims with persistence. Vivian Baptiste Vivian Baptiste is Grant's girlfriend. She has children and is still married to another man but they are in the divorcing progress. She is not as outspoken and overbearing as Miss Emma and Tante Lou but Vivian is definitely a strong black woman. In many instances, her strength emphasizes Grant's weakness. She has defied her family by marrying a dark-skinned black man, even though her action causes her to be ostracized from her family. Although she loves Grant she does not hesitate to point out his shortcomings, tactfully, without challenging his male ego. Vivian is a lady, refusing to let Grant take advantage of her. After nursing his wounds following his barroom brawl, she gives him an ultimatum: Unless he is willing to show her some consideration, she will leave him. Vivian is a mother, teacher, and lover and is totally aware of her responsibilities. For Vivian being a teacher indicts to be a leader and role model. Vivian takes an active role in trying to change the status quo. Her goal is to instil hope in her students for a brighter future and a life outside the limited plantation community. She does this by building their self-esteem and helping them become contributing members of the community, Edna Guidry Edna Guidry is the sheriff's wife. She is an extremely kind woman with a deep heart and ability to sympathize people. Actually, this woman is one of the rare characters in the book that can deeply and sincerely sympathize with black people. Being a wife of the sheriff, Edna makes all she can to better the position of Jefferson and let his people visiting him. The woman is not able to do much, but it is clear how crossed she is with the situation. One can notice how this situation touches her heart. It is important to mention that Edna sympathizes not only Jefferson. She is also crossed with the condition of the widow Grope. The woman does not take the one side protecting someone's rights. She just empathizes to those who are crossed and look broken. She is ready to hug Madame Grope, and at the same time, she sincerely asks Gran to say Miss Emma how sorry she is about Jefferson. Both sides have their pains and Edna is compassionate with all of them. Throughout the story Edna's addiction to drinks is noticeable. It is not accurately told but one can easily notice the hint on this condition. Occupation \\\\- Miss Emma: cooked at the Pichot house \\\\- Tante Lou: maid at the Pichot house \\\\- Vivian: teacher at a black catholic school in Bayonne \\\\- Edna Guidry: housewife \\\\- Shirley: waitress at Rainbow Club They do not own leading roles in politics or community. Vivian is the only one who visited a university, the only one who experienced a further education. Due to their position in the community, they are not really capable of influencing the court. The Role of Women The women in this novel are the moving roles. Without them the whole plot would not be happening because of their activity and them taking action. It is clear that Jefferson would have died like a ‚Äúhog‚Äù if it was not for Tante Lou and Ms Emma. The feminine characters like Vivian are mainly responsible for the outcome of the situation. She convinces Grant to stay in Bayonne which allows Jefferson a death in dignity. Tante Lou and Emma Glenn treat Grant and Jefferson like their maternal children and care selflessly for their family members. Thanks to Edna Guidry sympathizing with the other women it is possible for them to visit Jefferson. Ms Emma is the first black woman having tea in the house of the white sheriff which conducts that gender, for woman, creates bridges across the racial segregation. The Feminine is desired to keep their communities stable. Emma, Lou and Vivian sacrifice their happiness for other's sake. Women seem more endeavoured to help others than men in this novel. How Does the Author Portray Women? Grant states: ‚ÄúA hero is someone who does something for other people. He does something that other men don¬¥t and can¬¥t do. He is different from other men. He is above other men. No matter who those other men are, the hero, no matter who he is, is above them.‚Äù These examples of feminine behaviour named above fit this definition of heroism. Gaines portrays them as strong people with a mind of their own. They do everything to help and support their beloved ones and take care of things. Besides that, they suffer under the conditions in their community and the racial segregation but even in this state, they keep their heads held up high. Gains presents women as an important part of the family and community who hold everything together but at the same time experience e a lot of pain and hard work. = Education = The theme of education is omnipresent throughout the novel especially through the role of the narrator Grant Wiggins ‚Äì the teacher of the local elementary school. He is assigned by the ‚Äúwhite folks around here‚Äù to teach the basics of knowledge like reading, writing and math in the heavily underfunded all-black school, the church serves as a classroom. His teaching methods are, as was probably normal at that time, very strict and brutal. After receiving higher education in university, he returned to his home community. Now seeing no progress in the future chances of his students, he feels frustrated and wonders about the relevance of the education since his students are likely to work like their families on plantations captured in the cycle of poverty and racism. He believes that Jefferson alone can break this circle by showing everyone that change is possible. (Despite attending university Grant himself is captured in the cycle and unsatisfied with his life. Education is also depicted as a root for frustration for another reason. In contrast to this academic education, Gaines continues the theme in Grant's task to teach Jefferson morality. Jefferson is a young man that was sentenced to death for a crime that he hadn't committed. During the process, the defence argued Jefferson was a hog that couldn't be judged like a man. Grant Wiggins has the task to morally transform his former student from a hog into a man. In that task, he is rivalled by reverend Ambrose, who thinks only the church can save Jefferson's Soul. The student-teacher relationship shifts from frontal teaching to an exchange between Grant and Jefferson. Facing the difficult task of teaching morality, Grant is reliant on Jefferson's own will. During the process, he discovers bit by bit how Jefferson opens himself to him and by that how he can reach him, and how to teach him to be a man. = The inescapable path = The term \\"inescapable path‚Äú and its meaning is quite illustrative for the novel. The main character Jefferson is trapped in his hopeless situation due to his sentence to the death penalty. Moreover, he can not withdraw from the encounters he has with the other main character Grant Wiggins, which also leaves the circumstances as inescapable. Grant Wiggins finds himself as well in an ineluctable position, where he would rather leave the town of Bayonne, but is constantly reminded of his commitments, regarding his students, his aunt and his partner Vivian. Furthermore, Grant sees society‚Äôs issues with racism as fairly graved when he realizes that corporately nothing progressed over the time being when he went to university: > \\"I had not come through that back door once since leaving for the > university, ten years ago.‚Äú Grant feels like that apartheid is still the trigger for the social scissors in their society. An example therefore is the vicious circle in which the male African-American men are said not to be able to protect their wives because of slavery. By moving from the south and with that escaping this accusation, they are said to act driven by weakness. As a result, we have a so-called vicious circle. That puts Grant in a rift. Either he resists the expectations of the white population and defends his \\"race‚Äú by staying or he fulfills his dream by moving but simultaneously satisfying them in their image of the Afro-American stereotype. Summarizing now the term ‚ÄûThe inescapable path‚Äú is very much relatable with the novel. Not only the already obvious indication such as Jefferson's situation but also other subliminal characteristics of the book describe that topic very well. Title The title of this novel is imperative in understanding one of the major themes. The entire book focuses on Grant's attempts to teach Jefferson a lesson. In order for Grant to be able to show Jefferson how to ‚Äòbecome a man,‚Äô he must himself understand the meaning. Symbolically, the butterfly towards the end of the novel is proof that both of these men have succeeded in their goals. > ‚ÄúI probably would not have noticed it at all had not a butterfly, a yellow > butterfly with dark spots like ink dots on its wings, not lit there. What > had brought it there? ‚Ä¶I watched it fly over the ditch and down into the > quarter, I watched it until I could not see it anymore. Yes, I told myself. > It is finally over.‚Äù At this point Grant realizes that Jefferson really did learn a ‚Äòlesson before dying.‚Äô When he says ‚ÄúIt is finally over,‚Äù he is not only referring to Jefferson's life, but also that his cowardly nature is ‚Äúfinally over.‚Äù He has once and for all taken a stand for what he believes in. This insures that he, too, has benefited from this entire experience. Jefferson's life was sacrificed in order for the white people in the community to gain a better understanding of the value of the black members of society.

It was first settled by the Germans in the 19th century.  History  Russian biologist Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai was probably the first European to visit the area. In 1871 he stayed at Astrolabe Bay south of present-day Madang for 15 months. He had a good relationship with the local communities before leaving, suffering from malaria. In April 1884 an expedition by the German New Guinea Company led by Otto Finsch and Eduard Dallmann arrived and named the landing point \\"Friedrich Wilhelmshafen\\"; however, they felt that the area was unsuitable for a settlement. A subsequent survey in 1888 mentioned good soil conditions that would make a coffee plantation possible. In the summer of 1891 a station was built and by September 1892 was the seat of the provincial administration; however, the Imperial Government Commissioner remained at Stephansort, some 23 kilometers away due to concerns about malaria. The name of \\"Madang\\" was used by Papuan natives who had accompanied the German administrators after their home island and only became the official name of the settlement towards the end of the German administration. Although the settlement was expanded from 1893-1894 with warehouses, a sawmill, hospital and other facilities, (including an ox- drawn railway to Stephansort) various ventures, such as the coffee plantations and atap palm processing proved economically ruinous, due to malaria and inclement climate. From 1895 and 1896 several German warships were stationed here for a survey of surrounding waters, during which time a total of 295 men came down with malaria. In 1899 the capital of the New Guinea Company was transferred to Herbertsh√∂he on the island of New Pomerania (now New Britain). Following World War I, the area was turned over to Australia as part of the League of Nations mandated Territory of New Guinea. The Imperial Japanese Army captured Madang without a fight during World War II in 1942. In September 1943, Australian forces launched a sustained campaign to retake the Finisterre Range and Madang. The town was captured on April 24, 1944, but during the fighting and occupation it was virtually destroyed and had to be rebuilt afterwards.  NGO presence in Madang  Madang is viewed by many in the country as being safer and more pleasant for expatriates than the larger cities of Lae and Port Moresby. Because of this, some NGOs have chosen Madang as the location of their main offices in country. CUSO (a Canadian NGO) and VSO (a British NGO) both have their headquarters in Madang. Save the Children, WWF, and World Vision are also present with branch offices in Madang. As a consequence Madang has a larger number of expatriates working and living in the town than its small population would suggest.  Transport   Climate   Education  Madang is the home of Divine Word University.  Products  Industry and farming are growing constantly in importance, especially for export. There are the widespread coconut palm plantations on the coast and cardamum is grown in Madang. The Kulili plantation is the second largest of Kar Kar Island's twelve plantations with its more than a thousand coconut palms and cocoa trees. 70% of the cocoa and 50% of the copra produced in Madang province comes from Kar Kar. In Madang province 173 regional languages are spoken, some of them being extremely different from the others.

It lies mainly along the A3057 road running north from Romsey towards Stockbridge, and shares a boundary with the village of Michelmersh. It has a population of approximately 400.  History  The name \\"Timsbury\\" is derived from the Old English timber + byrig (dative of burh), meaning 'timber fort or manor'.Mills, A.D: A Dictionary of English Place-Names, page 330. Oxford University Press, 1991. Timsbury has grown from a traditional village centred on the Manor House (now split into many dwellings) and the Church of St Andrew. Although there may have been a Saxon church, the current Grade II listed building dates from around the early 15th century and was badly damaged by fire on 9 March 2014. Historically, Edmund Sharp and his wife Alice moved from the county of Berkshire to Timsbury towards the end of the seventeenth century. A direct descendant of Edmund Sharp was Richard Sharp (politician), once hailed as possibly being the most popular man in Georgian London.see Clayden, P. W. : The Early Life of Samuel Rogers Smith, Elder & Co. 1887. An interesting anecdote has survived concerning one of Edmund's sons, Richard, who, born in 1665 gained a reputation as an accomplished wrestler and ‚Äòcudgeller‚Äô in the area. Even in those days cudgelling was a very old custom and especially popular in the West of England where great pride was attached to skills which were often handed from father to son. It was a fast and furious activity conducted brutally using a short club and the expression ‚Äòto break a head‚Äô was associated with the cudgeller's sport since the victor was he who first drew blood from a gash to the head. The story recorded by his grandson and clearly cherished by later generations underlines the extent of Richard's physical prowess, > While he lived at Romsey he of a summer‚Äôs day rode up to Timsbury, where he > lived, where he had been brought up and where when young he had been so fond > of wrestling. It so happened that a stage was erected and sitting on his > horse he stayed long enough to see a man throw two or three men who had > mounted the stage against him, till all were intimidated from entering the > list; the conqueror ‚Ä¶. triumphed on the stage with so much arrogance that my > grandfather was tempted to humble him; therefore he got off his horse, > mounted the stage, threw the boaster on his back and having humbled the > boaster he immediately took horse and left them.Knapman, D. - Conversation > Sharp - The Biography of a London Gentleman, Richard Sharp (1759-1835), in > Letters, Prose and Verse. [Private Publication, 2004]p.1 British Library. In time the Sharp family became well established in the Romsey area and during the 18th and 19th centuries many of them held important positions as merchants or influential citizens of Romsey. A brass floor plate in Romsey Abbey commemorates many of them. Cartoonist Norman Thelwell made his home in the village, in a remodeled farmhouse with a trout pond, described in his 1978 book A Plank Bridge by a Pool.  Village Life  In modern Timsbury, the local amenities include a garden centre with cafe, a pub called \\"The Malthouse\\", a car sales garage, a fishery, St Andrew's Church of England church, a Jehovah Witness's Kingdom Hall, a recycling site, the Hunts Farm Sports Ground, and a pre-school. The ladies of Timsbury were bequeathed a hall which was used by the Women's Institute (WI), however, following a decline in local WI membership the hall was sold to the village band. Many local facilities are shared within the civil parish of Michelmersh and Timsbury due to their close proximity, including the Jubilee (village) Hall and the sports pavilion. The villages share a common village design statement to guide development in the area. The local telephone exchange is located in nearby Braishfield, with most telephone numbers in the village 01794 368XXX. The parish publishes a bi-monthly newsletter distributed free to households in the parish.

The agency ceased to exist separately on 1 April 2008 when it became part of Land and Property Services, an executive agency of the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel, along with the Rate Collection Agency, the Valuation and Lands Agency, and the Land Registry. Description It was an Executive Agency within the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the Northern Ireland Executive. The Ordnance Surveys of Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland share a common heritage: the British Ordnance Survey (OS) ceased to map Ireland just before the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 (the Partition of Ireland having already taken place in May 1921 with the creation of Northern Ireland). The new Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland (OSNI) officially came into existence on 1 January 1922, while the new Ordnance Survey of Ireland (OSI) came into being slightly later, on 1 April 1922. Products The vast majority of OSNI's income came from the licensing of its digital mapping data, which, because of the long history of mapping in Ireland (see Ordnance Survey) is amongst the most detailed and comprehensive in the world. Digital products range from the Large Scale (1:1250 urban and 1:2500 rural) vector database, 1:10,000 raster mapping derived automatically from the L/S vector, 1:50,000 and 1:250,00 vectors, 1;10,000 orthophotography, 1:25,000 leisure maps, the 1:50,000 raster series, 1:250,000 Ireland North raster, street maps of the main conurbations, as well as paper derivatives of all the raster products. In 2005 OSNI began, with the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI), to digitise the complete set of historical maps dating back to the 1830s. (The earliest comprehensive and accurately surveyed large scale mapping in the world). These are being georectified to match modern mapping projections and are being annotated with points of interest from PRONI's archives. OSNI also maintained the UK's only common address database, Pointer, which cross matches and validates the address data from the Royal Mail, Valuation and Lands Agency, OSNI and local authorities, and georeferences each address, as well as giving it a unique identifier. This allows spatial interrogation by customers of the >800,000 addresses in NI using computerised Geographic Information Systems (GIS) combined with digital mapping and the customer's own data. Supporting the interconnectivity of Geographical Information (GI) for the benefit of the Northern Ireland economy, society and administration was OSNI's primary purpose. In support of this, OSNI also provides the secretariat for Mosaic, the GI strategy for Northern Ireland, which is the first such strategy to be implemented in the UK. In support of Mosaic, OSNI is currently (2006) building a GeoHub for the region, which will be able to host and connect to spatial data from multiple sources, permit a metadata (data about the data) search and, using thin client browser applications, via the Internet, permit multiple data layers to be interrogated, connected, analysed, licensed, downloaded, uploaded and updated. Starting in Spring 2006, OSNI's own full product range is available via a map-enabled e-commerce website at www.osni.gov.uk OSNI's surveying technology is based on both photogrammetry and ground survey using total station electronic theodolites in combination with pen (tablet) computers, so that the data is updated directly into the digital format. The photogrammetry (using flight-derived stereoimagery at high resolution) is also used to maintain height models of the topography (Digital Terrain Model or DTM). Computer software permits the draping of aerial photography and/or mapping over such models for the purposes of fly-through or drive-through 3D visualisations. OSNI's Geodesy section maintains the positional reference system to millimetre precision and OSNI's ground stations allow high accuracy use of the GPS system.

He broke into the first team at West Bromwich Albion under the management of Ron Atkinson in the late 1970s, when Albion were enjoying a strong run of form which saw them finish in the top five for all but one season between 1977 and 1981, and also reached a UEFA Cup quarter-final. Whilst a West Bromwich Albion player he played in a benefit match for Len Cantello, that saw a team of white players play against a team of black players. In the autumn of 1981, Moses was transferred from West Bromwich Albion to Manchester United for ¬£500,000, arriving at Old Trafford a month before Bryan Robson who went for a club record ¬£1.5 million. He made his United debut on 19 September 1981 against Swansea City. He scored his first goal for United in the same season, and in doing so became the first black player to score for the club. Moses was a key midfielder for United during the 1980s, but suffered a succession of serious injuries. He missed the FA Cup final triumphs of 1983 due to suspension and 1985 due to injury, and played his last game for the club in the 1987‚Äì88 season. He was on the verge of being capped for the England team in 1985 before an injury ruled him out of action, causing him to miss most of the 1985‚Äì86 season. He also faced competition from Norman Whiteside for a place in central midfield, after Whiteside was converted from a striker to a midfielder. Injuries had gradually forced him out of the team and he finally announced his retirement from playing in the 1988‚Äì89 season at the age of just 28. In 2000, Moses was working as a property dealer in Alkrington, Greater Manchester, and in his spare time, coaching the Manchester Warriors under-20 inline skating side, which had just won the GB Inline Hockey League and \\"every other trophy going\\".

It crosses the Charles River from the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston into the city of Cambridge via the Harvard Bridge, where it bisects the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, passes through Central Square, and curves around two sides of Harvard Yard at Harvard Square. After Harvard Square it turns sharply northward, passes Harvard Law School, then passes through Porter Square, where it bears northwestward. It continues through North Cambridge, Arlington, and Lexington, where it enters the Minuteman National Historical Park. =Extended route= The road, by the same name, continues northwest and west, through many different cities and towns. It largely parallels or joins Route 2 and Route 2A, all the way into central Massachusetts, with a few gaps at towns that have different names for the central road. For much of its length, Massachusetts Avenue is a center of commercial activity, especially through the larger towns. Apartments, shops, and restaurants fill both sides of it, and there is a lot of pedestrian traffic. A number of linear parks cut across various portions of Mass.

(These travels were on the Cambridge side of the Charles River; the Harvard Bridge was not constructed until the 1880s.) =Early names and evolution= Massachusetts Avenue was formed at the end of the nineteenth century from what were separate roads. In Boston the road was previously called East Chester Park south of Chester Square and West Chester Park to the north (Chester Square is in the South End and is now called Chester Park). Across the river in Cambridge the road follows part of what was once Front Street near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then follows the former Main Street to Harvard Square (Main Street originally ran between Kendall and Harvard Squares, and the part to the east of Central Square retains the original name). From Harvard Square to the Arlington line at Alewife Brook it follows what had been North Avenue since 1838, and prior to that the Road to Menotomy. In Arlington it follows the former Arlington Avenue, and in Lexington it follows the former Main Street south of the Battle Green and the former Monument Street north of the Battle Green.

The synagogue was designed by Ludwig F√∂rster and built between 1856 and 1862 in neo-Romanesque style. Its Kazinczy Street facade has a rose window and narrow Gothic windows. The synagogue has three aisles. The women's balcony is supported by slim iron pillars decorated with Gothic Revival and Neo-Byzantine elements. The painting of the walls feature ornamental Eastern design. When designing the synagogue, F√∂rster made some innovations: he had an organ built and the Torah reader's platform was put before the Ark, not in the centre of the synagogue. These innovations were rejected by the Orthodox majority of the city's Jews, and in the year following the opening of the synagogue a rabbinical assembly in S√°toralja√∫jhely excommunicated the rabbi of Miskolc. The Jewish citizens of Miskolc decided to remove the organ from the synagogue and put the platform in the centre, in accord with tradition. This event led to a split in the Jewish community, and the local Hasidim (\\"Sefardim\\") separated from the rest, building a small place of worship in K√∂lcsey street, which no longer survives. Another synagogue built in 1817, in P√°l√≥czy Street, was demolished in 1963.

Illegal ventures such as loansharking might also be included. The poverty industry makes roughly US$33 billion a year in the United States. In 2010, elected American federal officials received more than $1.5 million in campaign contributions from poverty-industry donors. In poorer countries, the poverty industry exploits the bottom of the pyramid and its extent can at times be used as a litmus test to assess the effectiveness of philanthropic poverty- alleviation initiatives. In some cases, the poverty industry directly takes advantage of philanthropic poverty-alleviation initiatives (e.g. formal, government-supported microfinance). For example, some moneylenders misrepresent themselves as formal microfinance initiatives or obtain loans from formal microfinance initiatives through deception.

Its ruins are located north of the modern town Tekirova in the Kemer district of Antalya Province in Turkey. It lies between the Bey Mountains and the forests of Olympos National Park, south of the tourist town of Kemer and on the 57th kilometre of the Antalya‚ÄìKumluca highway. Phaselis and other ancient towns around the shore can also be accessed from the sea by daily yacht tours.  History  The town was set up by the Rhodians in 700 BC. Because of its location on an isthmus separating two harbours, it became the most important harbour city of eastern Lycia and an important centre of commerce between Greece, Asia, Egypt, and Phoenicia, although it did not belong to the Lycian League. The city was captured by Persians after they conquered Asia Minor. Cimon, in 468 BC, attacked the city and it was enrolled in the Delian Confederacy.Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Cimon, 12 Later it was captured by Alexander the Great. After the death of Alexander, the city remained in Egyptian hands from 209 BC to 197 BC, under the dynasty of Ptolemaios, and with the conclusion of the Apamea treaty, was handed over to the Rhodian Peraia, together with the other cities of Lycia. From 190 BC to 160 BC it remained under Rhodeian hegemony, but after 160 BC it was absorbed into the Lycian confederacy under Roman rule. Phaselis, like Olympos, was under constant threat from pirates in the 1st century BC, and the city was even taken over by the pirate Zekenites for a period until his defeat in 77 or 76 BC by the Romans under Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus. In 42 BC Brutus had the city linked to Rome. In the 3rd century AD, the harbor fell under the threat of pirates once again. So it began to lose importance, suffering further losses at the hands of Arab ships, until totally impoverished in the 11th century. When the Seljuqs began to concentrate on Alanya and Antalya as ports, Phaselis ceased to be a port of any note. There was a temple of Athene at Phaselis, where the lance of Achilles was exhibited. It was the birthplace of the poet and orator Theodectes. It was also renowned for its roses, from which the essence was extracted. from the Catholic Encyclopedia.  Bishopric  Phaselis became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Mira, the capital of the Roman province of Lycia. Its bishop Fronto took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451. His successor, Aristodemus, was one of the signatories of the letter that in 458 the bishops of Lycia sent to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian concerning the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. The bishop of the time of the Second Council of Nicaea (787) did not attend, and the acts were signed in his name by a deacon called Ioannes.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 985-986Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 450Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 450 No longer a residential bishopric, Phaselis is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 893  Notable People  * Lacritus, a Greek sophist * Critolaus, a Greek Peripatetic philosopher * Theodectes, a Greek rhetorician and tragic poet Phaselis today Phaselis has three harbours: the 'Northern Harbour', the 'Battle Harbour' and the 'Protected (Sun) Harbour', of which the last is the most important today. A 24-metre-wide ancient street runs through the middle of the city. The 'Hadrian Waterway Gate' is on the southern part of the street. There are ruins of shops and stores on the sides of the street and near these are ruins of public places such as Roman baths, agoras and theatres. These structures are dated to the 2nd century BC.

The fulminate ion, , is a pseudohalic ion because its charge and reactivity are similar to those of the halogens. Due to the instability of the ion, fulminate salts are friction-sensitive explosives. The best known is mercury(II) fulminate, which has been used as a primary explosive in detonators. Fulminates can be formed from metals, such as silver and mercury, dissolved in nitric acid and reacted with ethanol. The weak single nitrogen-oxygen bond is responsible for their instability. Nitrogen very easily forms a stable triple bond to another nitrogen atom, forming nitrogen gas.  Historical notes  Fulminates were discovered by Edward Charles Howard in 1800. The use of fulminates for firearms was first demonstrated by a Scottish minister, A. J. Forsyth, who patented his scent-bottle lock in 1807; this was a small container filled with fulminate of mercury.Alexander Forsyth in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Joshua Shaw determined how to encapsulate them in metal to form a percussion cap, but did not patent his invention until 1822.

Her appearance in the short softcore film Sex is My Business led to her meeting with magazine publisher David Sullivan, who promoted her widely as a model, and featured her in the softcore comedy Come Play With Me, which ran for a record-breaking four years at the same cinema. However, in her later years she faced depression and pressure from frequent police raids on her sex shop. After a downward spiral of drug addiction, shoplifting and debt, she died at home of an overdose of medications and vodka. She was 33. Millington has been described as one of the \\"two hottest British sex film stars of the seventies\\", the other being Fiona Richmond. Early life Quilter was born out of wedlock, and grew up without her father, John William G. Klein (1899-1973), initially in Willesden and later in Mid Holmwood near Dorking. She was bullied at school due to being born illegitimately, and suffered from low self-esteem throughout her childhood and teenage years. She left school at 15 and in 1964 she married Robert Maxted, and lived in Dorking. She had to nurse her terminally ill mother for more than ten years, and began her porn career to pay for her care. She had decided that she wanted to be a fashion model but at 4 feet 11 inches she was not tall enough. Instead she became a glamour model in the late 1960s. Career Soon after becoming a glamour model, she met the glamour photographer and pornographer John Jesnor Lindsay, who offered to photograph her for softcore magazines. She became one of his most popular models and began appearing in 8 mm hardcore porn loops which sold well in Europe. One of her first films was Miss Bohrloch in 1970. Miss Bohrloch won the Golden Phallus Award at the Wet Dream Festival held in November 1970 in Amsterdam. Maxted starred in around twenty short hardcore films for John Lindsay, although only five (Miss Bohrloch, Oral Connection, Betrayed, Oh Nurse and Special Assignment) have so far resurfaced. She then returned to modelling for British pornographic magazines such as Knave and Men Only. She also appeared in softcore short films by Russell Gay (Response, 1974), Mountain Films (Love Games, Wild Lovers) and Harrison Marks (Sex is My Business, c. 1974). Sex is My Business was shot late on a Saturday night at a sex shop on London's Coventry Street. The storyline concerns a powerful aphrodisiac being dropped by a customer, the potency of which renders the shop's staff and customers sex crazy. Maxted, dressed in a short see-through dress, is the film's main focus of attention, playing a member of staff who drags a customer into the back room for some multi-position sex, thoughtfully turning on the shop's CCTV camera so others can watch. Sex is My Business was considered something of a lost film until a Super 8 mm film print of the film was located and privately transferred to DVD in 2008. The film subsequently made its internet debut on 26 July 2008 at the (now defunct) site ZDD Visual Explosion. In 2010 Sex is My Business was included as a special feature on the DVD re-release of Come Play With Me. In February 1974, Maureen O‚ÄôMalley, her co-star in Sex is My Business introduced her to adult magazine publisher David Sullivan. Although she was still married, the pair became lovers. He rebranded her as Mary Millington. In her first appearance in Sullivan's Whitehouse magazine, he claimed that she was the bisexual nymphomaniac sister of the magazine's editor Doreen Millington, and so gave Mary her new stage name. She became well-known thanks to her appearances in Sullivan's porn magazines such as Whitehouse and Private. She soon became the most popular model in any of Sullivan's magazines. In November 1977 magistrates acquitted her and Sullivan following prosecution under the Obscene Publications Acts. She had a small part in Sullivan's 1977 softcore sex comedy Come Play with Me, alongside Alfie Bass and Irene Handl. Although critically panned, the film was highly successful, running continuously for four years at one London cinema. It then became one of the first British films to sell in large numbers on the new VHS format. This was followed by a larger role in The Playbirds (1978), in which she was cast as a policewoman working undercover as a nude model. Although her lack of acting training was evident, The Playbirds was a commercial success. Like Come Play with Me it was extensively trailed in Sullivan's magazines. She made many public appearances at this time, promoting her films in regional cinemas, opening shops and restaurants, and raising money for the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. At the height of her fame she was also working behind the counter in Sullivan's sex shops, mainly in the Whitehouse shop in Norbury. She continued working as a call girl, which she had done since her early modelling days. She then made a cameo appearance in Confessions from the David Galaxy Affair (1979), which was a flop, and Queen of the Blues (1979). She appeared in other sex movies such as Eskimo Nell (1975), Intimate Games (1976) and Derek Ford's What's Up Superdoc! (1978). Millington's final appearance was in the Sex Pistols film Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, directed by Julien Temple, which was released theatrically in March 1980. However, neither she nor her punk rock co-star Sid Vicious lived to see the completion of the movie. Liz Fraser, one of her co-stars in the film, remembered \\"I was next to this girl called Mary Millington, and she and I had a great chat together‚Ä¶. and then we went into the pub for a lunch during the filming of that and someone said 'she‚Äôs a porn star' and I said 'I don‚Äôt understand what do you mean' and he said 'porn, p-o- r-n' and he said 'she‚Äôs naked and she does everything in all these films' but she was lovely and so I met my first porn star\\". One of Millington's most outrageous moments was being photographed topless outside 10 Downing Street. Millington, while posing for an innocuous picture with a policeman outside Number Ten, decided to unzip her top, exposing her breasts for the photograph, much to the surprise of those present, including fellow Come Play With Me actress Suzy Mandel, Whitehouse photographer George Richardson (who took the picture anyway) and the policeman in question (who tried to confiscate the film). According to Simon Sheridan's biography of Millington, \\"For this stunt Mary was conditionally discharged and bound over to keep the peace\\". Millington's film Come Play With Me still stands as one of the longest-running films in British movie history, and ran continuously at the Moulin Cinema in London's West End from 1977 to 1981. In a publicity stunt for the second anniversary of the film's opening, both Suzy Mandel and Millington posed in lingerie on the Moulin cinema's marquee.Suzy Mandel and Mary Millington pictured April 1979 In 1978 she was approached to appear in a hardcore porn film called Love is Beautiful, to have been directed by Gerard Damiano. However, despite Millington and Damiano being pictured together at that year's Cannes Film Festival, the movie (meant to have been produced by David Grant‚Äôs Oppidan Films) never materialized. Potential co-stars may have included Harry Reems, Gloria Brittain and Lisa Taylor. That same year she turned 33, and found herself being replaced by younger models in Sullivan's magazines. In March 1978 she ceased to work in Sullivan's Whitehouse sex shop in Norbury and opened her own in Tooting called Mary Millington's International Sex Centre. She began to spend more time working in her own sex shop, selling illegal material. The shop was raided by the police on numerous occasions, and she claimed the police threatened her and forced her to pay protection money. In the past she had publicly criticised police raids on sex shops and published the addresses and telephone numbers of Scotland Yard, the Director of Public Prosecutions and Members of Parliament in her magazines. Last years and death Millington had always been prone to neurosis and depression, which was exacerbated by her cocaine habit. Her mother's death in 1976 also affected her deeply, and her behaviour became unpredictable, which led to her breaking up with Sullivan. Her life had begun a downward spiral into drug use and depression following the raids on her shop. A few months prior to her death, she had received a large tax bill which she was unable to pay. Her kleptomania became more pronounced in the last year of her life, with arrests for shoplifting in June 1979, and again for stealing a necklace the day before her death. Millington committed suicide at age 33, by an overdose of tricyclic antidepressant anafranil, paracetamol and alcohol at her home in Walton-on- the-Hill, Surrey. Her husband found her dead in her bed on 19 August 1979. She left four suicide notes which were found near her body. In one of them she had written, \\"The police have framed me yet again. They frighten me so much. I can't face the thought of prison... The Nazi tax man has finished me as well.\\" In another note, to her solicitor Michael Kaye (partly published in Private magazine no 59), Millington wrote \\"the police have killed me with their threats‚Ä¶the police have made my life a misery with frame ups. The tax man has hounded me so much- I will be made bankrupt, he mustn't get anything of his ¬£200,000 demands. He is a religious maniac.\\" In another note, to David Sullivan, she wrote: \\"please print in your magazines how much I want porn to be legalised, but the police have beaten me\\". Millington was a member of the National Campaign for the Reform of the Obscene Publications Acts (NCROPA) and encouraged her readers to demand the abolition of the Acts. After her death, NCROPA founder David Webb wrote \\"Mary was a dear, kind person and we much admired her courage in standing up to the bigotry and repression which still so pervades the establishment of this country. She obviously had tremendous pressures put on her as a result and there is no doubt in my mind that these must have contributed to this tragedy.\\" She was buried at St Mary Magdalene Church, in South Holmwood, Surrey marked by a grey granite tombstone which bears her married name. She is buried in the same grave as her mother, Joan Quilter, who died in 1976. Legacy Millington has been described as one of the \\"two hottest British sex film stars of the seventies\\", the other being Fiona Richmond. David Sullivan described her as \\"the only really uninhibited, natural sex symbol that Britain ever produced and who believed in what she did\\". Between 1975 and 1982 there was always at least one of Millington's films playing in London's West End. A posthumous exploitation film about her life was released in London in October 1980, entitled Mary Millington's True Blue Confessions. In 1996, Channel Four screened a tribute to her entitled Sex and Fame: The Mary Millington Story, featuring an interview with David Sullivan. Twenty years after her death, the author and film historian Simon Sheridan put Millington's life into context in the biography Come Play with Me: The Life and Films of Mary Millington. Further information about her career can be found in Sheridan's follow-up book Keeping the British End Up: Four Decades of Saucy Cinema, the fourth edition of which was published in April 2011. In 2004 Millington's prominence was recognized by her inclusion in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, edited by Colin Matthew and Brian Harrison. Her entry was written by Richard Davenport-Hines. In 2008 an exhibition of the work of the late glamour photographer Fred Grierson was held in London, which included several little-seen pictures of Millington taken by Grierson at June Palmer's Strobe Studios in the early 1970s. In 2009, Millington was referenced in an episode of EastEnders (broadcast Thursday 18/06/09) when Aunt Sal (Anna Karen), after hearing Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Janus) had been caught in a compromising position on the Queen Vic's floor, greeted Ronnie with \\"ooh, here she is, Mary Millington herself\\". In late 2009, an 8 mm copy of one of her early John Lindsay short films Special Assignment resurfaced. Unseen since the early 1970s, it was subsequently transferred to DVD. Two years later in 2011, Wild Lovers, another 8 mm film starring Millington, was also traced and transferred from 8 mm to DVD. A nightclub in Liverpool is named after her. She is commemorated in a blue plaque on the site of the former Moulin Cinema in Great Windmill Street, Soho for her appearance in Come Play with Me. The film ran there continuously for 201 weeks, from April 1977 to March 1981, and is listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the longest-running British film. However, the validity of this record and the blue plaque has been called into question by film historian Allen Eyles who says that Come Play with Me ran for 165 weeks and that Britain's longest running film was South Pacific which ran for four years and twenty-two weeks. Respectable ‚Äì The Mary Millington Story (2015) A feature-length documentary chronicling Millington's life, entitled Respectable ‚Äì The Mary Millington Story, was partly-shot and produced at Pinewood Studios in 2015. Written, directed and produced by Mary Millington's biographer, Simon Sheridan, the film mixes archive footage, previously unseen photographs and interviews with Millington's family, friends and co-stars, including David Sullivan, Pat Astley, Dudley Sutton, Linzi Drew and Flanagan. The film received its world premiere at London's Regent Street Cinema on 7 April 2016. A DVD of the film was released in the UK on 2 May 2016. Filmography * Miss Bohrloch (short, 1970) * Oh, Nurse!

He is best known for his role as the cowboy Trampas during the entire run from 1962 to 1971 of the series The Virginian, loosely based on the Owen Wister novel. Background McClure was born in Glendale, California. His English mother, Clara Elsie (n√©e Barker; 1907‚Äì1997), had moved to the United States in 1915, when her widowed mother married an American, Frank S Artman. Clara Barker was naturalized as an American citizen in 1918, and married Irish-American Donald Reed McClure (1904‚Äì1965) in 1929. Donald and Clara were parents to Donald Reed McClure Jr. (1931‚Äì2003) and then Doug. The widowed Clara married former mayor of Beverly Hills Frank Clapp in 1971. Career McClure's acting career included such films as The Enemy Below, The Unforgiven and Because They're Young, then he landed the role of Trampas on The Virginian, a role that would make him famous. He also starred: * As C.R. (Christopher Robin) Grover in the sci-fi/detective series Search (1972‚Äì1973), in which he rotated the lead with Hugh O'Brian and Anthony Franciosa as a high-tech PROBE agent. * As Cash Conover, casino owner, co-starring with William Shatner, in the one-season series The Barbary Coast (1975‚Äì1976). McClure replaced Dennis Cole who played the role of Conover in the show's pilot. * As Mayor Kyle Applegate on the fantasy sitcom Out of This World (1987‚Äì1991). McClure had a minor role in 1957 as an Army officer in \\"California Gold Rush in Reverse\\" on the anthology series Death Valley Days. The episode is a dramatization of the race in 1848 between the Army and the Navy to be the first to deliver gold nuggets from California to Washington, D.C. In 1958 and 1959, McClure appeared in three episodes of the series 26 Men, stories of the Arizona Rangers.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), p. 113 McClure as Trampas in NBC's The Virginian McClure was in the third episode \\"Mr. Denton on Doomsday\\" of CBS's The Twilight Zone. In 1962, he was cast as Trampas on NBC's The Virginian. His co-stars throughout the series were James Drury, Roberta Shore, Lee J. Cobb, Randy Boone, Gary Clarke, Clu Gulager, Diane Roter, Charles Bickford, Sara Lane, Tim Matheson, Jeanette Nolan and John McIntire. In 1965, he appeared in Shenandoah, a movie directed by Andrew V. McLaglen and starring James Stewart, Glenn Corbett, Patrick Wayne, Katharine Ross and Rosemary Forsyth. After The Virginian ended in 1971, McClure was slated to co-star with Bette Davis on a series about a parolee assisting a judge, played by Davis, by doing detective work. The pilot, produced and written by the team of Richard Levinson and William Link, failed to generate interest in the series and was released as a TV movie titled The Judge and Jake Wyler. McClure made another attempt at a television series during the 1972‚Äì1973 season by co-starring on SEARCH as a hi-tech investigator, rotating with Anthony Franciosa and Hugh O'Brian, and again in 1975‚Äì1976 in The Barbary Coast, co-starring William Shatner (with whom he'd starred in The Virginian episode \\"The Claim\\"). He shifted to low- budget science fiction movies such as At the Earth's Core, The Land That Time Forgot and The People That Time Forgot, all three based on the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. In 1967, he played the Errol Flynn role in a remake of Against All Flags titled The King's Pirate. He was cast in the lead in three adventures: The Longest Hundred Miles, The Birdmen, and State of Division (also known as Death Race). In the 1970s and 1980s, McClure appeared in commercials for Hamms Beer.Doug McClure Played Trampas and commercial Dick Kleiner syndicated column, Ocala Star-Banner, Oct 29, 1982. McClure also appeared as the blonde slave to Jamie Farr's character in the sequel Cannonball Run II (1984). He also had a cameo role as a poker player in the 1994 remake of Maverick. In 1994, McClure was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television at 7065 Hollywood Blvd. It was unveiled in what was his final public appearance.  Death  Doug McClure's gravestone Doug McClure's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame On February 5, 1995, McClure died at age 59 from lung cancer in Sherman Oaks, California. He is interred at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica, California. McClure was married to his fifth wife at the time of his death. McClure was divorced four times, including twice while he was performing on The Virginian. He was also survived by his two children, actress Tan√© (from his first marriage) and Valerie (from his fourth marriage).  In popular culture  The character of Troy McClure on The Simpsons was modeled after McClure and fellow actor Troy Donahue. Mike Reiss, executive producer of The Simpsons, said that Doug McClure's daughter informed him that Doug was a big fan of The Simpsons. She said that while watching an episode Doug saw the character Troy McClure on the show and said \\"Are they making fun of me?\\" Doug said he thought the parody was funny, and his daughters would call him Troy McClure behind his back as a joke.The Simpsons, Season 2 DVD, Episode: \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\" In the episode of Red Dwarf titled \\"Backwards\\", Rimmer and Kryten landed on Earth. When Rimmer asked Holly what the time period was, his question was \\"Do we expect to see a herd of flesh-eating dinosaurs feeding off the bones of Doug McClure?\\" McClure is referenced in the Red Dwarf episode \\"Legion\\" in an apology from Kryten to Lister about the evening movie: \\"I'm sorry sir, it is another Doug McClure. Please, don't hit me.\\" Filmography William Bendix, Lynn Bari, and McClure in Overland Trail (1960) Sebastian Cabot, Carolyn Craig, and McClure in Checkmate (1962) =Film= * Friendly Persuasion (1956) ‚Äì Soldier (uncredited) * The Enemy Below (1957) ‚Äì Ens.

As indicated by the name, bid whist adds a bidding element to the game that is not present in classic whist. It is generally accepted that the game of bridge came from the game of whist. Bid whist, along with spades, remains popular particularly in U.S. military culture and a tradition in African- American cultureDictionary of American regional English, vol. 2 p. 229, Frederic Gomes Cassidy - Belknap Press and Harvard University Press with probable roots in the period of slavery in the United States.The Everything Card Games Book: A Complete Guide to Over 50 Games, p. 93, Nikki Katz - Adams Media  The game  The general play of bid whist is similar to that of whist, with four notable exceptions. In whist, the trump suit for a given hand is determined at random by the last card dealt, whereas in bid whist, the trump suit (or whether there will even be a trump suit) for a given hand is determined by the outcome of the bidding process. Secondly, whether a trick is won by the higher-ranking card of the winning suit, or by the lower-ranking card of that suit is also determined by the outcome of the bidding process. Thirdly, whether the ace is the highest-ranking card of the suit or the lowest-ranking card can change from hand to hand, depending on whether higher- ranking cards or lower-ranking cards win in that hand. And lastly, the scoring of the game is handled differently. =Card ranking= Uptown Trumps: Big joker, little joker, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 Non-trump: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 Downtown Trumps: Big joker, little joker, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K Non-trump: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K = Kitty = In most variations, a 'kitty' of four, five, or six cards is dealt separately from the cards delivered to each player. If no jokers are being used, the kitty will consist of four cards. If one joker is being used, the kitty will consist of five cards. And if two jokers are being used, the kitty will consist of six cards. = Bidding process = In bid whist, after all of the cards have been dealt, but prior to the beginning of game play, each player may submit a bid. If a player chooses not to bid, the player may pass. Just as with the game play, the bidding starts with the player to the dealer's left and proceeds clockwise to each player in turn, ending with the dealer. In order to bid, a player must make a bid that is 'better' (see below) than the best bid made by a previous player for the current hand. Unlike bridge, no deals are passed. If the first three players pass, the dealer (the last player) must make a bid. Most games set a minimum bid of at least four, though \\"officially\\" three is the minimum bid. A player's bid consists of a declaration of the minimum number of books (over the required 6 books) that will be taken (turned) by that player and their partner, followed by an indication either that the player wishes there to be no trump suit for the current hand, or of whether the player wishes for higher-ranking or for lower-ranking cards to be victorious in the current hand. In determining what makes a bid 'better' than a previous bid, the initial consideration is the number of books being declared. Bidding a higher number of books than the current bid is always sufficient for making a better bid. Bidding a lower number of books can never be sufficient. If a player wishes to bid the same number of books as the current, the next consideration is whether the current bid indicated there would be no trump suit. If not, and the current bid indicates that there will be a trump suit, then the player now bidding may better the current bid by claiming the same number of books but now bidding that there will be no trump suit. If the current bid already indicates there will be no trump suit, that bid may only be bettered by indicating a higher number of books. In some variations, a bid which indicates that there will be a trump suit, and that higher-ranking cards will win, can also be bettered by bidding the same number of books and indicating that there will be a trump suit and that lower-ranking cards will win. In other variations, however, a bid for higher-ranking cards and a bid for lower- ranking cards, each with the same number of books, are considered equal bids. A no trump bid can be made without an over bid and can be a high(uptown)or a low(downtown) bid. A no trump bid takes out a trump bid. At the end of the bidding process, the player who has made the best bid is deemed to have won the bid. The winning bidder's indication regarding either having no trump suit, or the ranking of cards is granted for the duration of the hand. That player and their partner are now committed to taking at least the number of books indicated in the bid. The opposing player and their partner are committed to 'setting' the bidding team by preventing the bidding team from succeeding in taking the number of books to which they are committed. If the winning bid indicated a desire for no trump suit, then prior to the beginning of game play, the winning bidder must now indicate whether high-ranking or low-ranking cards will be victorious during that hand. Conversely, if the winning bid indicated whether high- or low-ranking cards would win during this hand, the winning bidder must now declare a trump suit for this hand. In high- winning hands, an ace serves as the highest card of its suit (better than a king). In low-ranking hands, an ace serves as the lowest card of its suit (under the 2). After making this final declaration, the player receives into their hand the cards from the kitty (if one was used), and the player then discards an equal number of cards from their hand. In some variations, the cards of the kitty are overturned (sported) to be visible to all players prior to the winning bidder taking those cards into their hand. In other variations, the kitty is not sported, and only the winning bidder sees what cards they are. The most commonly played variation is to sport the kitty when there is a trump suit, and not sport when there is no trump suit. If there is a trump suit in the upcoming hand, and if jokers are being used, the jokers become the best cards of the trump suit (better than the ace) regardless of whether high- ranking cards or low-ranking cards are the winners. If there is no trump suit, the jokers are worthless. = Play = The objective of the play is to win tricks. A trick consists of four cards, one from the hand of each player, in rotation, the first card played to a trick generally being called the lead. A player is required to follow suit to the card led, if possible. Failure to follow suit when a player has a card of the suit played is called a renege (see Renege below). If the player cannot follow suit, he may play any card. Some people play that if the hand is a no trump hand and a player has a joker in his hand, he must throw off the joker the first time a suit is played and the player does not have a card of the suit played. Other players play that if the hand is a no-trump hand, players who have a joker must turn in the joker for one of the discarded cards in the kitty. Many people do not like to play the latter way, because it gives an indication of what suit the bid-taker has discarded. For trump bids, it is generally preferred to cut a suit with a trump card when the player cannot follow the suit controlled by the opponents. The highest bidder always plays the first lead card in the game. After this play, the player who won the trick leads off to the player seated at his left. The play continues in this way until all twelve tricks have been played. When a trick is completed, i.e., four cards played, a member of the side which won the trick takes the four cards, turns them face down, and places them in front of him in a row. It is customary for one player to take in all the tricks won by his side. The tricks should be kept separated from one another so that any previous trick can be referred to, if necessary. A player may turn and look back at the last trick until he or his partner has led or played to the next player. After that, he may not look at any previous tricks, unless a renege is called. = Strategy = Bid whist is a game of skills and strategy. While you cannot audibly tell your partner what you want him to play (this is called talking across the board), there are many non-verbal cues that partners give each other during play. It is very common for a player to indicate to his partner in what suit he has a winner other than trump. This is usually done by the player playing a card from a strong suit in his hand when he is out of the trump suit. For example, trumps are hearts and it's an uptown (high cards win) hand. A player has strong diamonds, e.g., an ace, king, queen. When that player runs out of hearts, the next time hearts are played, he will throw off a low diamond. This typically tells his partner he has some help for him in diamonds. Skilled players typically pull trumps. This means they start off playing the trump suit and \\"pulls\\" all the trumps from the opponents. Once trumps are pulled from the opponents, the bidding player will begin playing his offsuit. A player will not continue to play trumps when the opponents are out of trumps, saving his trumps to cut another suit that is played. Not pulling trumps can lead to a team being set. For example: trumps are spades and the bid is uptown, high cards winning. An opposing player has one spade, a three of spades, and no diamonds. The bidding player has an ace, king and queen of diamonds. Instead of pulling trumps from his opponents, the player plays his ace of diamonds. The opposing player with no diamonds and (for this hand) a lousy trump, will cut the ace of diamonds and take the trick. The bidding player should have first pulled trumps and then played his offsuit, the diamonds. Similarly, if the bidding player's partner takes a trick, he will give the lead back to his partner by leading back trumps, giving control back to his partner. If the partner began playing what he thinks are winning cards, he runs the risk of one of the opposing players not having the suit played and cutting with a trump card. Also, by playing something other than his partner's trump, he opens up his partner's hand for the opposing team to see. That is, the opposing team will see what suit, other than trump, is in the bidding player's hand. The opposing team will then know what suit to keep for play when the trump suit is not played. = Renege = If a player fails to follow suit, e.g., clubs are led, player has a club, but plays a spade (or some other suit), the player has reneged. It is up to the opposing team to spot the renege and call it. If a renege is called, the player calling it must name the specific book where the renege occurred. If the player successfully calls the renege, the team reneging loses three tricks. If the player calls a renege and cannot identify the exact trick where the renege occurred, then the team calling the renege loses three tricks. = Scoring = Each team begins the game with a score of zero. At the end of each hand, the bidding team either wins points by making their bid or loses points by failing to take enough books to satisfy their bid (known as being set). The game ends when a team wins by achieving a cumulative score of seven or more, or loses by reaching a cumulative score of minus seven or worse. At the end of each hand, the books that the team that won the bid are counted. There are 13 altogether, corresponding to the 12 cards played by each player plus the kitty (if one is used), which counts as a book won by the bidder's team. Each book won above six counts toward the team's bid. In order to make their bid, the bidding team must take at least the number of books equal to six plus their bid. *If the bidding team makes their bid, they score one point for every book they took after the initial six. If they fail to take enough books for their bid, they score nothing for their books, and instead their bid is subtracted from their score. A team may win more than they bid, but may lose only what was bid. In either case, the opponents of the bidding team neither win nor lose any points. Note: If Team A won the bid with a 5 High they must take 11 tricks (Initial 6 plus their bid of 5) to make their bid. If they only take 10 books (the kitty and 9 other books) Team A would have failed their bid (also known as being set) and they would go back 5 points. On the other hand if Team A made 12 books (the kitty plus 11 other books) on our 5 bid, we will score a total of 6 points for that hand. *If a team takes all 13 tricks (initial 6 plus 7), this is commonly called a Boston. A team can make a Boston regardless of the number of tricks that are bid. *If a player bids 7, this is also called bidding a Boston. In this case, the bidding player is saying that the opposing team will not collect any tricks. *A no trump bid can sometimes score double (e.g. if you bid a four no trump and do not make the bid, it counts for eight points against your team. Conversely, if you make a four no trump bid, it counts as eight for your team). *Rather than counting the tricks won, most players keep track of the tricks taken by the opposing team (e.g., it takes four books to set a four, three books to set a five, two books to set a six, and so forth). *If a team wins a game by bidding a Boston, the total tally for the game counts as two wins. =Speeding up the game= Some people play that if you miss two bids (missing a bid being called a \\"felony\\" also called \\"lies\\") you lose. This usually happens at card parties when there are other pairs waiting to play. This may be to speed up the game, as people can go on for hours going up and down before achieving seven positive (winning) or negative points (losing). You can also speed up the game by \\"going out the back door\\" i.e. the losing bid(points) goes to the opponent. Say one team has bid successfully for a three and later the opposing team bids four and gets set, the team with three wins. When there are more than two pairs of players, you can choose to play 'Rise and Fly'. If one pair gets 'set', or doesn't make their bid, they must get up and let the next waiting pair sit and play. This is the most common practice when playing with more than 4 people. This is not done when keeping score. When the opponent reaches a score of seven or more, they have won. That's when the loser gets up, or 'rises'.  Cutthroat bid whist  Bid whist may also be played as an individual game. For most players, the standard 54-card deck with a 6-card kitty may be used. For a 5 player game, the kitty should be reduced to 4 cards. =Bidding= Bids may begin at any number, and indicate the number of books the player expects to take. This number is not the bid plus six, but is an exact number (a bid of 4 would require the individual to take at least 4 books). Since players do not need to communicate with a partner, there is no need to indicate uptown or downtown with their bid. Thus, the bids, from lowest to highest, are: 1, 1NT, 2, 2NT, 3, 3NT, etc. After all but one player has passed, the player with the highest bid then announces uptown or downtown plus the trump suit, if applicable, and takes the kitty. That player is then solely responsible to take at least the number of tricks bid. =Scoring= At the conclusion of the hand, each player, including the winner of the bid, scores 1 point, individually, for each trick taken. If the bid winner fails to make his bid, he scores zero points, and loses the amount of his bid. The first player to score 30 points, individually, is the winner.

Between the years 1863 and 1892, ten grammar schools were opened under the auspices of the Act. The first of these was Ipswich Grammar School, which opened in 1863. Brisbane Grammar School, 1874 (the school would later move to Gregory Terrace) History of the Act The Grammar Schools Act was the fourth bill of the first parliament of Queensland. Along with the Primary Schools Act (Qld) 1860, it aimed to bring Queensland under one general and comprehensive education system without prejudice. Toowoomba Grammar School, sketch prior to construction, 1875 In the early years of Australian education, denominational schools (particularly Anglican schools) had a large influence. These schools were criticised over a number of decades for proliferating a social divide, and providing poor and biased education. By the time of the first parliament of Queensland in 1860, there was a general feeling that any system of education established in Queensland should be free of denominationalism. The Act received little opposition in either House of Parliament ‚Äì revealing its popularity. It found the approval of the public in general, and even amongst sections of the Anglican community. The Act marked a departure from the education systems in place in Victoria and New South Wales, where schools were generally tied up with respective religious bodies or (in the case of schools such as Sydney Grammar School) being provided massive, ineffective endowments, with little effort required from the community. Brisbane Girls Grammar School, circa 1905 Townsville Grammar School, circa 1905 The main points of the Act are summarised below. Basically, the Act allowed for the establishment of a grammar school in any town where ¬£1000 could be raised locally. The Queensland Government then matched that figure. The Schools were to be administered by a seven-member Board of Trustees, of which four members were appointed by the Governor. The Act also made provision for public scholarships for students to attend university in Britain or the southern states of Australia. Ipswich Girls' Grammar School, 1894 The act was repealed in 1975 and replaced with the Grammar Schools Act 1975. Schools opened under the Act Rockhampton Girls Grammar School, circa 1895 There were ten grammar schools opened under the Act ‚Äì eight of which remain open today. In chronological order, they were: #Ipswich Grammar School for boys (1863) #Brisbane Grammar School for boys (1868) #Toowoomba Grammar School for boys (1875) #Brisbane Girls Grammar School (1875) #Rockhampton Grammar School initially for boys and girls, later only for boys (1881) #Maryborough Grammar School for boys (1881) #Maryborough Girls Grammar School (1883) #Townsville Grammar School for boys and girls (1888) #Ipswich Girls Grammar School (1892) #Rockhampton Girls Grammar School (1892) When it opened in 1881, Rockhampton Grammar School was co-educational. Only four years later, the Board of Trustees decided to exclude females from the School, leading to the construction of Rockhampton Girls Grammar School. The latter opened on 11 March 1892 ‚Äì one day after the official opening of Ipswich Girls Grammar School. (Females were readmitted to Rockhampton Grammar School in 1977 after a 92-year absence). In 1936, hit hard by the effects of the Great Depression, the Maryborough Grammar School and Maryborough Girls Grammar School were forced to close. They were subsequently taken over by the Department of Education, Queensland Government, and renamed the Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Boys and Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Girls. In 1974, these schools merged to become the Maryborough State High School. Main Points of the Act The main aspects of the Act were as follows: *That where ¬£1000 was raised by donation or subscription in any district for the purpose of establishing a Grammar School, then the Governor (with the advice of the Executive Council), if satisfied with the proposed School, paid to the Trustees \\"a sum not exceeding the amount raised\\". *That when fees to the amount of ¬£250 per annum were promised for a period of not less than three years, the Governor (with the advice of the Executive Council) shall pay out of the general revenue of the Colony ¬£500 to the credit of the Trustees, towards the upkeep of the School. * A body of seven persons, to be called the Trustees of the School, were to be elected. Four of those seven were to be nominated by the Governor (with the advice of the Executive Council), whilst the other three were to be elected by vote of subscribers of over ¬£5 to the funds of the School. *The Governor (with the advice of the Executive Council) was permitted to, in any one year, reserve 10% of the amount payable to a School to provide for scholarships to any British or Australian university. Such scholarships were awarded after public competitive examinations.

It originates from the east of Tapaste and flows north-west into the Straits of Florida. The river acts as a water supply for Havana. The final stretch divides the municipalities of Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n (Vedado district) and Playa (Miramar district). Part of the river valley forms the Almendares Park or Metropolitan Park of Havana (PMH), a few kilometers upstream from the ocean. Several industrial plants line the river banks (paper mills, gas production plants, breweries, food production plants, construction plants). One of the three major projects by the Havana authorities is to continue the rehabilitation of the PMH (the other two being the restoration of the Old Town and the depollution of the Havana Bay): monitor and control water pollution, reduce and rationalize industrial occupation, maintain the old trees and the vegetation in the park. The area is gradually becoming a green oasis with playground, a few restaurants and footpaths. The Almendares River, the main river flowing through the city of Havana, is the most contaminated river in the western hemisphere. It is dead, with no animal life History: The Cuban aborigines called it Casiguaguas, and the first colonizers named it La Chorrera, when it was discovered, until they changed it to Almendares in honor of the Bishop of Havana, Enrique Almendaris. The first aqueduct that was built for the city of Havana took its waters directly from the Almendares River, and it became known as \\"Zanja Real\\" -1545-. Over the years, this ditch began to be insufficient and stopped working, giving way to the project of Francisco de Albear y Lara, the largest Aqueduct in the city built in 1859 - 1897. La Zanja Real, remained a few years lending services. The undisciplined social and industrialists began to pour their sewage waters into it, causing the stoppage of the flow from the river and its change of direction, possibly turning this ditch into the First pronounced injection of sewage into Almendares! In the six years between 1824 - 1829 a lot of money was spent on the conservation and service of the Zanja Real. It was Mr. Conde Villanueva who promoted the conduction of the Fernando VII aqueduct, a work that considerably improved Havana's drinking water supply. There were few obstacles that this man encountered to be able to materialize the project and get the water from the river. In those years, due to the overflows of the Almendares, the use of the Fernando VII aqueduct was insufficient due to the continuous turbulence, many of the people of Havana knew of the flooding of the river (6 meters above the usual level -October 6, 1860-) by The quality of the water that reached Havana was due to the fact that the use of the filters was not enough to clean the liquid that the entire city needed and its pressure was insufficient. The difference in level with the long-awaited Vento Springs where the water was clean and transparent was approximately 13 feet below, which led to the subsequent diversion. According to Mr. Jos√© Luis Casaseca, it must be counted that the first canal built delivered 35 to 40,000 cubic meters per day, a quarter of which flowed the capacity shared with the Fernando VII aqueduct, 9 times greater than what the system filters yielded. Despite this, the qualities of the precious liquid were compared as it appears in one of the tables of the 1864 report to \\"start the project.\\" In 1865, after starting the catchment project, Albear describes in one of his notes: ‚ÄúHundreds of springs scattered over a large area on the margins, and even the very banks, and even within the same waters, of a mighty river ; all different in projection, in quantity, in elevation, in direction; whimsically joining or separating ... \\" After the North American intervention in Havana -1898- the engineers of the time began to fiddle with, what is known as the first attempt to divert the Almendares riverbed. A project that thanks to the good sense of Colonel Black (the person who ran the city in those years) ordered to verify and analyze with extreme caution. On December 24, 1907, Mr. Montoulieu, by appointment of Colonel Black, replaced the American Engineer Mr. Arthur S. Hobby B., former Head of water and sewage at the headquarters of the city of Havana. In 1908, Colonel Black honestly declared: \\"that he had doubts and fears about the origin of the springs\\" so he ordered to suspend the excavation works, the planned cuts in the rocky mountains (near the current Fontanar district) and the modification of the river channel at the site, as the nature, the characteristics of the place and the currents that originated the \\"Vento springs\\" are unknown. Urged by the composition of the waters of Havana from the Vento springs, product of the accentuated floods of the river (more than 6 meters above the usual level) and because these waters constitute a patrimony of the capital of Cuba, the work in 1912 for the \\"Theory of hydraulic plugging\\" by Eng. Enrique J. Montoulieu. Project that contemplated the construction of a ‚Äúwooden dam‚Äù that would balance the pressures of the precious liquid between the outcrops (springs) and the level of the river, thus avoiding pollution and the escape of pressure to its channel. In 1912 the first wooden and clay dam was built to maintain the level in the Vento Springs. The construction of the ‚ÄúWooden Dam‚Äù downstream of the ‚ÄúTaza de Vento‚Äù, the questioning of the project, plus the health situation of the city in those years (1912) spread the social problem in the press (Revista de la sociedad cubana engineers and the newspaper \\"El d√≠a\\"). In 1925, Eng. Juan Antonio Coscullela Barrio published an article entitled: \\"The Vento channel, what has not been done and should be done\\" where the nebulous issue of water use was discussed. It was not until 1926 that the necessary liquid retention modifications were approved through the ‚ÄúWooden Dam‚Äù and the water supply in the Albear Canal by Mr. Enrique J. Montoulieu. On December 15, 1927, the supply of water to the city was increased by 25 million gallons per day due to the arrival to the new \\"Small Cup\\" of the groundwater pumped from the \\"Aguada del Cura\\" aqueduct, a system that It introduced the mineral to the \\"Canal de Vento\\" conceived to withstand the current of water and not its pressure. Over the years, the walls of the ‚ÄúCanal de Vento‚Äù began to deform, increasing leaks, penetrating the roots of the trees through the cracks, which began to hinder the movement of the liquid and its maintenance. A deterioration that, if not overcome in 1949, with the new 66-purged pipe placed on the bridge that crosses the river would have caused its destruction. Later, in the 1940s - 1950s, the consumption of the precious liquid became more pronounced, due to the growth of the city and it was necessary to build a new dam -1949- by Eng. Abel Fern√°ndez Sim√≥n with a mechanism that would guarantee the control of the fluid , discarding the previous wood and mud dam that had been used since 1926 to maintain recharge levels (infiltration of the water table) in the extraction zone -Vento Cup- built in 1835 and with this the flow level was maintained, the balance and sprouting of the springs in the region. In 1949, the concrete ‚ÄúNew Dam‚Äù was built with a solid structure of ramps, aprons and strainers that would prevent the clogging of the gates that would control the river levels in floods, guaranteeing the balance of the system necessary to keep the current in the river, the quality of the water in the aqueduct and the maintenance of the entire area. It was not until the execution of the ‚ÄúEj√©rcito Rebelde‚Äù reservoir (1974) on the ‚ÄúRoca de Vento‚Äù that the Almendares (La Chorrera) began to lose its natural strength (downstream) due to the cut off of its current, when ‚Äútrying to collect water \\"In a\\" curtain 2,331 kilometers long and 29.10 m high \\"-data from the National Institute of Hydraulic Resources- which causes, according to the current behavior and the analysis of the aforementioned investigation, that water infiltrates the\\" Rock de Vento ‚Äù(areas distinguished on maps) towards the water table due to the pressure of the liquid produced by the construction of the reservoir in the place and the evaporation of the water into the atmosphere. In his work ‚ÄúTowards a Culture of Nature‚Äù (1998), Antonio N√∫√±ez Jim√©nez declares: ‚ÄúMan cannot renounce to carry out those works that he believes are necessary for his progress, but he must also understand his enormous inability to foresee the evils that they engender against itself by carrying them out. An example: the Rebelde Army dam on the Almendares River was built to provide more water for agriculture, but it has never been filled, because much of it infiltrates into the limestone subsoil, an advantage, because it hydraulically enriches the water table, but then An unforeseen evil occurred: the Almendares stopped flowing from the Lenin Park downstream with sufficient force for the permanence of the current, which resulted in the stagnation of its waters, its greater contamination and rotting. It happened to its waters what happened to a sanitary service that does not discharge its excrement. A faithful and probative picture of what Federico Engels expressed about Nature taking revenge every time Man tries to modify it to a great extent ‚Äù. The situation of the river in recent years is incomparable in the late 1940s, when the Casiguagua dam was built. In 2011, the water barely exceeded the same in a few moments (only when it rained heavily). In February 2012, the precious liquid is withdrawn from its edge, stagnating the water in the entire section between this place and the ‚ÄúPuente de Calabazar‚Äù. Current necessary to maintain the ecosystem (trees and animals), a liquid that infiltrates little by little in the layers of the earth, to the point of completely drying the river in many sections. In recent years, some media have disclosed the state of the Vento springs, I quote: \\"As a consequence, for the third time in more than 70 years, the springs that feed the small bowl of the Vento canal were exhausted, and it is the first occasion that this conduit, the lowest part of the Almendares- Vento basin, reaches such depressed levels. This, together with the Ariguanabo, is providing three times less water, than the norm with even more unfavorable forecasts \\"... The lawyer Antonio de Ch√°ves, finished forming the project of Juan de Rojas on bringing to this population water from this Almendares river, vividly representing to the Audiencia, the Council of the Indies and the King of Spain the need for it to be executed.1 It was strongly used throughout the colonial, republican and revolutionary period, concentrating large industries, until in the years of the 1990s, it was decided to start a program for its environmental rehabilitation, which has managed to reduce the pollution levels of the river and reforest its basin.

English has initiated and participated in illegal public art campaigns since the early 1980s and for this is often referred to as the 'Godfather of Street Art'. Ron English street art activities are the subject matter and covered extensively in the Pedro Carvajal documentary titled Popaganda. Culture jamming is one aspect of English's work. Although never an official member, Ron several times joined with the Billboard Liberation Front, which practices culture jamming by altering billboards by changing key words to radically alter the message, often to an anti-corporate message. Frequent targets of English's work include Joe Camel, McDonald's, and Mickey Mouse. English intends his culture jamming technique to inspire people to question consumer capitalism. English does this by using his over emphasized, grotesque, and to some, offensive, characters to intrigue the consumer, luring them in to reveal the truth behind the product. Later English focused on another form of advertising: product packaging. He recreates several different kinds of packaging (cereal boxes, milk cartons, cigarette packs, etc.), to reveal truth in advertising. After designing the packaging English and his Team POPaganda infiltrate different retailers around the country and \\"shop gift\\". Some of English's product packaging designs include, \\"Cap'n Corn Starch\\", \\"Duncan High Hash Brownies\\" and \\"Camel Kool's\\" THC Enriched Tobacco Cigarettes. English has created murals a locations throughout the world. Fine art English is a fine art painter specializing in oils. He received his bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. After receiving his MFA from The University of Texas he moved to New York City and apprenticed with several artists, beginning to sell his own work. His style is characterized by extreme photo realism, use of secondary color and appropriation of pop imagery. Frequent themes are revisiting and reworking childhood with adult skill as well as examining the darker meanings behind garish pop surface imagery. English also uses historical imagery as a template to explore universal issues. He has frequently reworked images of The Last Supper, Starry Night, and Picasso's Guernica.\\"Death and the Eternal Forever\\" Korero Press, 2014 English has appropriated many well known images and characters from pop culture, reworking them into his own images. These include a reworking of Charlie Brown into his \\"Grin\\" character and one of his famous \\"MC Supersized\\" based on the idea that Ronald McDonald ate his own product. Another image of the idealized American female is that of Marilyn Monroe with Mickey Mouse breasts. In 1980, English exhibited \\"Grade School Guernica\\", one of his versions of Picasso's Guernica, at the Station Museum of Contemporary Art in Houston. The painting depicts the scene acted out by his children viewed from the point of view of the bomber airplane.

Its creation was based on the Law 1164 from June 1927, which was passed in order to Turkefy the population. The Erzincan province was included in this area. The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars, G√ºm√º≈ühane, Erzincan and Aƒürƒ±. It was governed by an Inspector General seated in the city of Erzurum. In January 1936, a Fourth Inspectorate-General was established, under which authority the province was transferred. The fourth UM included the provinces of Erzincan, Tunceli, Elazƒ±ƒü and the areas which would become the province of Bing√∂l. The Fourth UM was governed by a Governor Commander. Most of the employees in the municipalities were to be from the military and the Governor Commander had the authority to evacuate whole villages and resettle them in other areas.

The Crowd in History. A Study of Popular Disturbances in France and England, 1730‚Äì1848. New York: Wiley & Sons. Biography Born in Oslo, the son of Jens Essendrop Rude, a Norwegian engineer, and Amy Geraldine Elliot, an English woman educated in Germany, Rud√© spent his early years in Norway. After World War I, his family moved to England, where he was educated at Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Cambridge. A specialist in modern languages, he taught at Stowe and St. Paul's schools. After completing university, Rud√© took a trip to the Soviet Union with friends. When he returned he was a \\"committed Communist and anti-Fascist\\", despite his family‚Äôs fairly conservative political views. In 1935 Rud√© joined the British Communist Party. Communism awoke in Rud√© an interest in history in which he pursued during the 1930s and 1940s attending London University part-time. During this time he taught at the preparatory schools of Stowe and St Paul‚Äôs. When the war broke out he joined the London Fire Service where he extinguished fires caused by German bombs. He received his doctorate at the University of London in 1950 for a thesis on crowd action during the French Revolution. He taught modern languages in English secondary schools while publishing. His first book, The Crowd in the French Revolution, soon became a classic. Rud√© was actively involved with the Communist party, an affiliation which caused him many hardships during his life. In 1949, he was relieved of his duties at St Paul‚Äôs for the activities of the political party which he was affiliated with. He accepted teaching positions at Sir Walter St John's Grammar School for Boys and later at Holloway Comprehensive School. Rud√©, making his new academic focus history, and with very little to back his research in Paris of revolutionary France, became a leading British historian of the French Revolution. Rud√© contributed to the \\"history from below\\" view of history, which is history from the view of the oppressed. He focused especially on those who participated in the riots and rebellions. He is credited by Eric Hobsbawm as having been the only member of the Historians' Group of the English Communist Party to write 18th-century history, exploring the chronological \\"no-man's land between the Group's two most flourishing sections\\".Eric Hobsbawm, 'The Historian's Group of the Communist Party' in Rebels and their Causes (Southampton: Humanities Press, 1979). After writing an article about rioters during the French Revolution, he was awarded the esteemed Alexander Prize by the Royal Historical Society in 1956. Rud√© wrote and was featured in a number of journals and created a scholarly name for himself under the wing of his mentor, Georges Lefebvre. Hobsbawm alleged that Rud√©'s thesis advisor, (Alfred Cobban, a political conservative), blocked any chances Rud√© may have had at getting an appointment at a University, but Friguglietti says there is no evidence of that. Feeling shunned in Britain, Rud√© began looking to opportunities abroad. In 1959, he was appointed senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide, in the home town of his wife Doreen. He took the opportunity of his time in Australia to research 19th-century British and Irish political prisoners transported to Australia as convicts. This later resulted in a major work, Protest and Punishment: The Story of Social and Political Protesters Transported to Australia, 1788‚Äì1868. Rud√©, like most prominent communists in Australia, was put under surveillance by the government's domestic security agency, ASIO. However, they found little of interest to record. One agent noted: \\"history books of which he is the author and reports of his class work at schools in England all show that he is objective in his approach to his teaching subject and has not let his own personal politics intrude in any way\\". Rud√© accepted an offer of a foundation chair of history, at the new University of Stirling, in Scotland, during 1967. However, he fell out with the university administration and returned to Adelaide in 1969, this time as professor of history at Flinders University. In 1970, Rud√© moved to Montreal, where he taught at George Williams University (later Concordia University) until he retired in 1987. He founded the Inter- University Center for European Studies. Rud√© was also a visiting professor at the University of Tokyo, Columbia University in New York and the college of William and Mary in Virginia. While he was at Concordia, he also taught in the Graduate Programme of Social and Political Thought at York University, Toronto. Rud√© suffered deteriorating health after the early 1970s and had a brain tumour removed in 1983. After retiring, he returned to England, eventually dying in hospital at Battle on 8 January 1993. His widow Doreen placed his ashes in the garden behind their home in Rye. A tall, handsome and athletic man, he always retained the manners of an English gentleman as well as his left-wing sympathies. Works George Rud√©‚Äôs historical work focused primarily on the French Revolution and crowd behaviour in France and Great Britain, during the 18th and 19th centuries. Rud√© utilizes the method of reporting and analyzing history from the \\"bottom up,\\" focusing on the people, not the leaders and elites. Rud√©‚Äôs most notable works include The Crowd in the French Revolution, The Crowd in History, Revolutionary Europe: 1783‚Äì1815, Ideology and Popular Protest, Paris and London in the Eighteenth Century, Debate on Europe: 1815‚Äì1850 and Captain Swing: A Social History of the great English Agricultural Uprising of 1830 (co-authored with Eric Hobsbawm). One of Rud√©‚Äôs most influential works is The Crowd in History, focusing on 18th- and 19th-century dissidents and revolutionaries in France and Great Britain.George Rud√©, The Crowd in History, A study of Popular Disturbances in France and England, 1730 ‚Äì 1848 (Serif, London, 2005). Rud√© analyzes the impact and importance of various uprisings between 1730 and 1848. He identifies grain shortages in France and industrialisation in Britain as the two recurring catalysts for disturbance. In this work Rud√© employs a clear and precise prose style, beginning with specific examples of disturbances in Part 1, and moving on in Part 2 to \\"a critical analysis of the crowd in its various manifestations\\".The Crowd in History, p. 15. In his introduction Rud√© expresses a hope that other historians will be inspired by his new bottom-up approach to write crowd-centric histories of other eras. He made no secret of his sympathy for the underdog, and this history offers a robust defence of popular uprisings in this period. In The Crowd in the French Revolution, Rud√© examines the historically neglected crowd of the French Revolution. He explains that the Revolution was not only political but more importantly a social upheaval in which the common Frenchmen played a tremendous role in the course and outcome of the Revolution. Most significantly, Rud√© analyzes the French crowds in great depth to understand their composition and force on history. Rud√© wrote a broad survey Revolutionary Europe: 1783-1815 in traditional fashion. In is he portrays France and Europe before, during and after the French Revolution. He examines the significance of the Revolution in context to the rest of the European world. The broader focus of this work was a shift from his crowd studies, which would resume in his later works. Rud√©‚Äôs Paris and London in the 18th Century explains the popular protests and revolts of Paris and London during the 18th century. Rud√© compares and contrasts the time, place, social, political and economic factors of Paris and London. He examines the pre-industrial stages and the turbulent events that occurred in both European capitals. While this work is not predominately a history from the \\"bottom up,\\" Rud√© does incorporate the impact of each class in Paris and London during the 18th-century events. In Ideology and Popular Protest, Rud√© defines the theory behind the ideology of protest beginning with its origins in Marx and Engels. He explains his theory of ideology through various situations in pre-industrial Europe. Rud√© also utilizes his explained ideology in the event of the English protests of the 18th and early 19th century and the development of the English industrial society, and closing with the possible implications of industry on society. Rud√©, in Debate on Europe: 1815-1850, attempts to utilize the views and interpretations of other historians to argue the significant period of the first half of the 19th century. He examines the rise of national powers, the impacts of the Industrial Revolution, differences of political opinions and the various revolutions throughout Europe during this period. In addition, Rud√© inserts his own argument based on the impressive and extraordinary change in Europe during this era as well as inferring at what point this change began. Captain Swing: A Social History of the great English Agricultural Uprising of 1830 is a prime example of George Rud√©‚Äôs focus on history \\"from below\\" and the examination of common people. In Captain Swing, Rud√© examines the people of the 1830 agricultural uprising and the impacts of these events. The entire focus of this work is on the crowd and their history, revealing a historical interpretation of history from the \\"bottom up.\\" Influence George Rud√©‚Äôs influence was his emphasis and development of \\"history from below\\". Following the new Annales School of thought, Rud√© strove to cast off the idea that history was only about nation-states and the men who ruled them. Accompanying Rud√© in this shift was the ‚Äònew left‚Äô, which according to Mark Gilderhus these liberal historians, \\"showed the feasibility of doing history while incorporating attitudes and viewpoints other than those associated with white male elites\\". Though Rud√© was not part of this movement directly, he was firmly inside their ideas and helped to promote them. He believed, along with the ‚Äònew left‚Äô that it was the neglected people who could be used to reshape the face of history. The historian James Friguglietti comments that Rud√©‚Äôs work, \\"displayed sympathy for the lower classes, whether laborers or convicted criminals\\". By focusing on lower classes Rud√© hoped to create a new understanding of histories major events. Rud√©‚Äôs communist ties shaped his way of perceiving history and opened him up to the idea of looking at the history of protesters. Revolutions were transforming events, and Rud√© sought to bring light to why someone would join in such an endeavor. Marxist theory believes that everyone‚Äôs primary motives for acting are always linked with their material need. Using this frame of reference Rud√© places it on the people of the French Revolution and created specific faces in the crowds. He sought to dismantle the myth that the crowd in the revolution is seen as a great evil mass of people bent on destruction of order. As Rud√© paints it, \\"those who took to the streets were ordinary, sober citizens, not half-crazed animals, not criminals\\". By taking such a view the history of the French revolution was transformed. Common people were suddenly being taken as important historical actors in their own context. In the decades that Rud√© was writing, his new way of looking at history fit well into the social scene. It was the age of liberation, as the oppressive systems that segregated classes, genders, and races were being torn down. People were in need of a new history that included all aspects of society. Writing \\"history from below\\", brought in those forgotten yet not unimportant members of history into the narrative. Rud√© did this by showing the common people in the revolutions and protests as key players who actively sought to change history. By focusing on such groups, historians have, \\"inspired new debates over the roles of class, gender, and race in accounting for human divisions and inequalities.\\" In helping bring a voice to prisoners and protesters, George Rud√© contributed significantly to the study of history. Rud√© is not without his detractors. From the start, his Marxist view of history made teaching in Great Britain very difficult at the height of Cold War fervour and brought him severe criticism. The main criticism that continues on after his death was that after developing his initial thesis of the crowd in history, he continued using that model in every case to prove his point. Some of Rud√©‚Äôs work became less highly regarded after the collapse of the USSR, but, overall, his contributions to social history and the understanding of protests greatly enhanced how historians look at the past and its actors.

It occurs in Southern Africa in Zimbabwe and southern and eastern South Africa. This species is found in coastal and mountain grassland, often near water. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Cape longclaw in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected from the Cape of Good Hope. He used the French name L'alouette du Cap de Bonne Esp√©rance and the Latin Alauda Capitis Bonae Spei. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Cape longclaw. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Alauda capensis and cited Brisson's work. The specific name capensis denotes the Cape of Good Hope. The species is now placed in the genus Macronyx that was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1827 with the Cape longclaw as the type species. There are two subspecies. Description The Cape longclaw is a 19‚Äì20 cm long. The adult male has a grey head with a buff supercilium and a streaked blackish back. It has a bright orange gorget, black breast band and otherwise yellow underparts. The female is duller, having a yellow throat and much weaker breast band. The juvenile has a dirty yellow throat, indistinct breast band, and yellowish white underparts. The Cape longclaw is usually found in pairs throughout the year. It feeds on the ground on insects and some seeds. The song is a musical cheewit cheewit, the contact call is tsweet, and there is also a mewling alarm call. Typically not found in larger groups than two, a breeding pair or more often singly. Another behavioural characteristic is the tendency of birds to stand on top of stones, anthills or large grass clumps. While doing so birds stand upright with their breast extended. This species has a striking resemblance to the unrelated icterid meadowlarks, grassland birds of the Americas. This is presumably due to convergent evolution.

The war arose from the long-running dispute between the Hutu and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population. A 1959‚Äì1962 revolution had replaced the Tutsi monarchy with a Hutu-led republic, forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. A group of these refugees in Uganda founded the RPF which, under the leadership of Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, became a battle- ready army by the late 1980s. The war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda, advancing into the country. They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Kagame, who had been in the United States during the invasion, returned to take command. He withdrew troops to the Virunga Mountains for several months before attacking again. The RPF began a guerrilla war, which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A series of protests forced Rwandan President Juv√©nal Habyarimana to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties. Despite disruption and killings by Hutu Power, a group of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993, the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the Arusha Accords in August 1993. An uneasy peace followed, during which the terms of the accords were gradually implemented. RPF troops were deployed to a compound in Kigali and the peace-keeping United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) was sent to the country. But the Hutu Power movement was steadily gaining influence and planned a \\"final solution\\" to exterminate the Tutsi. This plan was put into action following the assassination of President Habyarimana on 6April 1994. Over the course of about a hundred days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the Rwandan genocide. The RPF quickly resumed the civil war. They captured territory steadily, encircling cities and cutting off supply routes. By mid-June they had surrounded the capital, Kigali, and on 4July they seized it. The war ended later that month when the RPF captured the last territory held by the interim government, forcing the government and genocidaires into Zaire. The victorious RPF assumed control of the country, with Paul Kagame as de facto leader. Kagame served as vice president from 1994 and as president from 2000. The RPF began a programme of rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of the country, bringing genocide perpetrators to trial, and promoting reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. In 1996 the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched an offensive against refugee camps in Zaire, home to exiled leaders of the former regime and millions of Hutu refugees. This action started the First Congo War, which removed long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. As of 2020, Kagame and the RPF remain the dominant political force in Rwanda. Background =Pre-independence Rwanda and origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa= A reconstruction of the alt=Photograph of King's palace in Nyanza, Rwanda depicting main entrance, front and conical roof The earliest inhabitants of what is now Rwanda were the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter- gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, Bantu groups migrated into the region and began to clear forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their land and moved to the slopes of mountains. Historians have several theories regarding the Bantu migrations. One theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, and the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly originating from the Horn of Africa. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory the Hutu and Tutsi are a later class, rather than a racial, distinction. The population coalesced, first into clans (ubwoko) and into around eight kingdoms by 1700. The Kingdom of Rwanda, ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became dominant from the mid-eighteenth century, expanding through conquest and assimilation. It achieved its greatest extent under the reign of Kigeli Rwabugiri in 1853‚Äì1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. These included uburetwa, a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them, and ubuhake, under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service. Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi were assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, and Germany established a presence in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the King. German policy was to rule through the Rwandan monarchy, enabling colonisation with fewer European troops. The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior. The Rwandan King welcomed the Germans, and used their military strength to reinforce his rule and expand the kingdom. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgian administration, in conjunction with Catholic clerics, modernised the local economy. They also increased taxes and imposed forced labour on the population. Tutsi supremacy remained, reinforced by Belgian support of two monarchies, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards classifying each individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. It had previously been possible for wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, but the identity cards prevented further movement between the groups. =Revolution, exile of Tutsi, and the Hutu republic= After 1945, a Hutu counter-elite developed, demanding the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu. The Tutsi leadership responded by trying to negotiate a speedy independence on their terms but found that the Belgians no longer supported them. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church, with prominent conservative figures in the early Rwandan church replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these, a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu. In November 1959, the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief in an assault by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the Rwandan Revolution. The King and Tutsi politicians launched a counter- attack in an attempt to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians, but were thwarted by Belgian Colonel Guy Logiest, who was brought in by the colonial Governor. Logiest re-established law and order and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite. He replaced many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and effectively forced King KigeliV into exile. Hutu army officer Juv√©nal Habyarimana (pictured) became President of Rwanda after a 1973 coup. Logiest and Hutu leader Gr√©goire Kayibanda declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961 and it became independent in 1962. More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda by 1964 to escape the Hutu purges, mostly to the neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. Many of the Tutsi exiles lived as refugees in their host countries, and sought to return to Rwanda. Some supported the new Rwandan Government, but others formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda, the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963. These groups were known in Kinyarwanda as the inyenzi (cockroaches). Historians do not know the origin of this termit is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting that they generally attacked at night. The inyenzi label resurfaced in the 1990s as a highly derogatory term for the Tutsi, used by Hutu hardliners to dehumanise them. The inyenzi attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them. The last significant attack was made in desperation from Burundi in December 1963 but failed due to bad planning and lack of equipment. The government responded to this attack with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda. Kayibanda presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy. In 1973 Hutu army officer Juv√©nal Habyarimana toppled Kayibanda in a coup. He founded the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party in 1975, and promulgated a new constitution following a 1978 referendum, making the country a one-party state in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND. Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence. A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to foreign aid receipts. The family of first lady Agathe Habyarimana, known as the akazu, were the principal winners in this fight. The family had a more respected lineage than that of the President, having ruled one of the independent states near Gisenyi in the nineteenth century. Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west. The akazu exploited this to their advantage, and Habyarimana was increasingly unable to rule without them. The economic situation forced Habyarimana to greatly reduce the national budget, which led to civil unrest. On the advice of French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand, Habyarimana declared a commitment to multi-party politics but took no action to bring this about. Student protests followed and by late 1990 the country was in crisis. =Formation of the RPF and preparation for war= The organisation which became the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) was founded in 1979 in Uganda. It was initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU). It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan President Milton Obote. Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, Idi Amin, including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame had joined Yoweri Museveni's rebel Front for National Salvation (FRONASA). Museveni fought alongside Obote to defeat Amin in 1979 but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the 1980 general election. With Rwigyema and Kagame he formed a new rebel army, the National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the Ugandan Bush War. President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to Nairobi in Kenya. In 1982, with the authority of Obote, local district councils in the Ankole region issued notices requiring refugees to be evicted from their homes and settled in camps. These evictions were violently implemented by Ankole youth militia. Many displaced Rwandans attempted to cross the border to Rwanda, but the Habyarimana regime confined them to isolated camps and closed the border to prevent further migration. Faced with the threat of statelessness, many more Tutsi refugees in Uganda chose to join Museveni's NRA. Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni with Ronald Reagan at the White House in October 1987 In 1986 the NRA captured Kampala with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, with the goal of allowing the refugees to return home. As well as fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988 a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, Kagame assuming the vice presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice president but resented the loss of the leadership. Bayingana and his supporters attempted to start the war with an invasion in late 1989 without the support of Rwigyema, but this was quickly repelled by the Rwandan Army. Rwandan President Habyarimana was aware of the increasing number of Tutsi exiles in the Ugandan Army and made representations to President Museveni on the matter. At the same time many native Ugandans and Baganda officers in the NRA began criticising Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions. He therefore demoted Kagame and Rwigyema in 1989. They remained de facto senior officers but the change in official status, and the possibility that they might lose access to the resources of the Ugandan military, caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. In 1990 a dispute in south- western Uganda between Ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land, many of whom were Rwandans, led to a wider debate on indigeneity and eventually to the explicit labeling of all Rwandan refugees as non-citizens. Realising the precariousness of their own positions, the opportunity afforded by both the renewed drive of refugees to leave Uganda, and the instability on the Rwandan domestic scene, Rwigyema and Kagame decided in mid-1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately. It is likely President Museveni knew of the planned invasion but did not explicitly support it. In mid-1990 Museveni ordered Rwigyema to attend an officer training course at the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth in the United States, and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior Rwandans in the army. This may have been a tactic to reduce the threat of an RPF invasion of Rwanda. After two days of discussion Rwigyema persuaded Museveni that following years of army duty he needed a break and was allowed to remain in Uganda. Museveni then ordered Kagame to attend instead. The RPF leadership allowed him to go, to avoid suspicion, even though it meant his missing the beginning of the war. Course of the war =1990 invasion and death of Rwigyema= On 1 October 1990 fifty RPF rebels deserted their Ugandan Army posts and crossed the border from Uganda into Rwanda, killing a Rwandan customs guard at the Kagitumba border post and forcing others to flee. They were followed by hundreds more rebels, dressed in the uniforms of the Ugandan national army and carrying stolen Ugandan weaponry, including machine guns, autocannons, mortars, and Soviet BM-21 multiple rocket launchers. According to RPF estimates, around 2,500 of the Ugandan Army's 4,000 Rwandan soldiers took part in the invasion, accompanied by 800 civilians, including medical staff and messengers. Both President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Habyarimana of Rwanda were in New York City attending the United Nations World Summit for Children. In the first few days of fighting, the RPF advanced south to Gabiro. Their Rwandan Armed Forces opponents, fighting for Habyarimana's government, were numerically superior, with 5,200 soldiers, and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by France, but the RPF benefited from the element of surprise. The Ugandan government set up roadblocks across the west of Uganda, to prevent further desertions and to block the rebels from returning to Uganda. On 2 October the RPF leader Fred Rwigyema was shot in the head and killed. The exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death are disputed; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian G√©rard Prunier in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book Africa's World War, Prunier says Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible. The argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, Stephen Nduguta, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother Salim Saleh to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana's and Bunyenyezi's arrests and eventual executions. When news of the RPF offensive broke, Habyarimana requested assistance from France in fighting the invasion. The French president's son, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, was head of the government's Africa Cell and promised to send troops. On the night of 4October, gunfire was heard in Kigali in a mysterious attack, which was attributed to RPF commandos. The attack was most likely staged by the Rwandan authorities, seeking to convince the French the regime was in imminent danger. As a result, 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, twice as many as initially pledged. The French operation was code-named Noro√Æt and its official purpose was to protect French nationals. In reality the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and Kigali International Airport. Belgium and Zaire also sent troops to Kigali in early October. The Belgian troops were deployed primarily to defend the country's citizens living in Rwanda but after a few days it became clear they were not in danger. Instead, the deployment created a political controversy as news reached Brussels of arbitrary arrests and massacres by the Habyarimana regime and its failure to deal with the underlying causes of the war. Faced with a growing domestic dispute over the issue, and with no obvious prospect of achieving peace, the Belgian government withdrew its troops by the beginning of November. Belgium provided no further military support to the Habyarimana government. Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko's contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP). Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF, but their discipline was poor. The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes, prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival. With French assistance, and benefiting from the loss of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the Rwandan Army enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF and pushed the rebels all the way back to the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda and others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. Habyarimana accused the Ugandan Government of supplying the RPF, establishing a \\"rear command\\" for the group in Kampala, and \\"flagging off\\" the invasion. The Rwandan Government announced on 30 October that the war was over. The Rwandan Government used the attack on Kigali on 4October as the pretext for the arbitrary arrest of more than 8,000 mostly Tutsi political opponents. Tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion; Radio Rwanda aired incitement to ethnic hatred and a pogrom was organised on 11 October in the Kibilira commune of Gisenyi Province, killing 383 Tutsi. It was the first time in nearly twenty years that massacres against Tutsi were perpetrated, as anti- Tutsi violence under the Habyarimana regime had been only low level up to that point. =Kagame's reorganisation of the RPF= alt=Photograph of a lake with one of the Virunga Mountains behind, partially in cloud Paul Kagame was still in the United States at the time of the outbreak of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth. He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion. At the end of September Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began. The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war. When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops. He flew through London and Addis Ababa to Entebbe Airport, where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service; the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass. Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October. The RPF were in disarray by the time Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low. He later described his arrival as one of the worst experiences of his life; the troops lacked organisation following Rwigyema's death and were demoralised after their losses in the war. Kagame was well known to the RPF troops, many of whom had fought with him in the Ugandan Army, and they welcomed his arrival in the field. He spent the following weeks gathering intelligence with senior officers. By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting. He therefore withdrew most of the army from north-eastern Rwanda, moving them to the Virunga mountains, along the northwestern border. Kagame knew that the rugged terrain of the Virungas offered protection from attacks, even if the RPF's position was discovered. The march west took almost a week during which the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, with the permission of President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan Army. Meanwhile, some RPF soldiers remained as a decoy to carry out small- scale attacks on the Rwandan Army, who remained unaware of the Front's relocation. The reorientation towards guerrilla warfare began with a raid on a Rwandan customs post across the border from Katuna. Following the attack, the Rwandan Government accused Uganda of deliberately sheltering the RPF. The RPF's new tactics inflicted heavy casualties on the Rwandan Army, which reacted by shelling Ugandan territory. Ugandan civilians were killed and a significant amount of damage to property was incurred, and there were reports of Rwandan troops crossing the border to loot and abduct locals. Conditions in the Virungas were very harsh for the RPF. At an altitude of almost , there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the high-altitude cold climate. Kagame spent the next two months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations. Alexis Kanyarengwe, a Hutu colonel who had worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation. Another Hutu, Seth Sendashonga, became the RPF's liaison with Rwandan opposition parties. Most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi. Personnel numbers grew steadily, volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries. Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldier conduct. Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population. The RPF punished personnel who broke these rules, sometimes with beatings, while more serious offences such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death. The RPF carried out a major fundraising programme, spearheaded by Financial Commissioner Aloisia Inyumba in Kampala. They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world, as well as from businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government. The sums involved were not enormous but, with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability. It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of a surplus of weaponry at the end of the Cold War. It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan Army; according to G√©rard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and secretly passed weaponry to the RPF. Museveni likely knew of this but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community. Museveni later said that \\"faced with [a] fait accompli situation by our Rwandan brothers\\", Uganda went \\"to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have been good for Uganda's stability\\". Journalist Justus Muhanguzi Kampe reported that the taking of military equipment by deserted Tutsi members of the Ugandan Army meant the national arsenal \\"nearly got depleted\\"; he suspected the war \\"must have had a tremendous financial impact on the Ugandan government, especially Uganda's military budget\\", costing the country \\"trillions of shillings\\". =Attack on Ruhengeri, January 1991= The town of alt=Photograph of Ruhengeri, Rwanda, with buildings, a street, and people visible, and mountains in the background, partially in cloud After three months of regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to fight again. The target for the first attack was the northern city of Ruhengeri, south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north-west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed the population would become aware of the RPF's presence and Kagame hoped this would destabilise the government. During the night of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters descended from the mountains into hidden locations around the city, assisted by RPF sympathisers living in the area. They attacked on the morning of 23 January. The Rwandan forces were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion. The Rwandan Police and army succeeded in briefly repelling the invasion in areas around their stations, killing large numbers of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the Rwandan Army forces were assisted by French troops, as the French Government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, the defending forces were defeated and the RPF held the whole city. Most of the civilian population fled. One of the principal RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest. When he learnt of the invasion the warden, , telephoned the government in Kigali to request instructions. He spoke to Colonel Elie Sagatwa, one of the akazu, who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison to avoid escape and defections during the fighting. He also wanted to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF. Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him and repeated the order, having confirmed it with the president. Eventually, the RPF stormed the buildings and the prisoners were liberated. Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including Th√©oneste Lizinde, a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980. The RPF forces held Ruhengeri through the afternoon of 23 January, before withdrawing into the mountains for the night. The raid undermined the Rwandan Government's claims that the RPF had been ejected from the country and had been reduced to conducting guerrilla operations from Uganda. The government sent troops to the city the following day and a state of emergency was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area. The RPF raided the city almost every night for several months, fighting with Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at war for the first time since the October invasion. =Guerrilla war, 1991‚Äì1992= Following the action in Ruhengeri the RPF again began to wage guerrilla war. The Rwandan Army massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key positions and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains, but the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all-out assault. Paul Kagame's troops attacked the Rwandan Army forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure the diplomatic and psychological effect of the RPF's resurgence was not lost. Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place. This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war. The RPF made some territorial gains including capturing the border town of Gatuna. This was significant as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of Mombasa via the Northern Corridor, forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier Central Corridor. By late 1991 the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory near Mulindi, Byumba province. Many Hutu civilians in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of internally displaced persons in the country. The renewed warfare had two effects in Rwanda. The first was a resurgence of violence against Tutsi still in the country. Hutu activists killed up to 1,000 Tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials, starting with the slaughter of 30‚Äì60 Bagogwe Tutsi pastoralists near Kinigi and then moving south and west to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi. These attacks continued until June 1991, when the government introduced measures to allow potential victims to move to safer areas such as Kigali. The akazu also began a major propaganda campaign, broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade the Hutu population that the Tutsi were a separate and alien people, non-Christians seeking to re-establish the old Rwandan feudal monarchy with the final goal of enslaving the Hutu. This included the Hutu Ten Commandments, a set of \\"rules\\" published in the Kangura magazine, mandating Hutu supremacy in all aspects of Rwandan life. In response the RPF opened its own propaganda radio station, Radio Muhabura, which broadcast from Uganda into Rwanda. This was never hugely popular but gained listenership during 1992 and 1993. The second development was that President Habyarimana announced that he was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his most loyal ally France. Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Liberal Party (PL), but the one- party state law had remained in place. In mid-1991 Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change that saw a plethora of new parties come into existence. Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF, but these were quite ineffective and had no political influence. The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the akazu. Progress remained slow in 1991 and 1992. A cabinet set up in October 1991 contained almost no opposition, and the administrative hierarchy across the country recognised the authority of only Habyarimana's National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development party. Another one-party cabinet was announced in January 1992 which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, forcing Habyarimana to make real concessions. He announced his intention to negotiate with the RPF, and formed a multi-party cabinet in April. This was still dominated by Habyarimana's party, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and negotiated a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began peace negotiations in the Tanzanian city of Arusha. =Peace process, 1992‚Äì1993= The peace process was complicated by the fact that four distinct groups were involved, each with its own agenda. The Hutu hardliners, centred around the family of Agathe Habyarimana, were represented by the CDR as well as extremists within the president's own MRND party. The second group was the official opposition, which excluded the CDR. They had much more democratic and conciliatory aims but were also deeply suspicious of the RPF, whom they saw as trying to upset the \\"democratic\\" policy of Hutu rule established in the 1959 revolution. The third group was the RPF. Paul Kagame engaged with the peace process against the advice of some of his senior officers, in the knowledge that many of those on the other side of the table were hardliners who were not sincerely interested in negotiations. He feared that shunning the opportunity for peace would weaken the RPF politically and lose them international goodwill. Finally there was the group representing President Habyarimana himself, who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could. This meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution, but privately obstructing the process and trying to delay change to the status quo for as long as possible. Habyarimana recognised the danger posed to him by the radical Hutu faction and attempted in mid-1992 to remove them from senior army positions. This effort was only partially successful; akazu affiliates Augustin Ndindiliyimana and Th√©oneste Bagosora remained in influential posts, providing them with a link to power. The delegates at the negotiations in Arusha made some progress in the latter half of 1992, despite wrangling between Habyarimana and hardline members of his party that compromised the government officials' negotiating power. In August the parties agreed to a \\"pluralistic transitional government\\", which would include the RPF. The CDR and hardline faction of the MRND reacted violently to this. Feeling sidelined by the developing Arusha process, they began killing Tutsi civilians in the Kibuye area; 85 were killed, and 500 homes burnt. Historian G√©rard Prunier names late 1992 as the time when the idea of a genocidal \\"final solution\\" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first mooted. Hardliners were busy setting up parallel institutions within the official organs of state, including the army, from which they hoped to effect a move away from the more conciliatory tone adopted by Habyarimana and the moderate opposition. Their goal was to take over from Habyarimana's government as the perceived source of power in the country amongst the Hutu masses, to maintain the line that the RPF and Tutsi more generally were a threat to Hutu freedoms, and to find a way to thwart any agreement negotiated in Arusha. The situation deteriorated in early 1993 when the teams in Arusha signed a full power-sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF and other major opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until free and fair elections could be held. The agreement reflected the balance of power at the time; Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition, and the RPF all accepted it, but the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole north-west of Rwanda and lasted for six days; many houses were burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. =RPF offensive, February 1993= alt=Map showing the partition of Rwanda between government, RPF, and demilitarised zones Paul Kagame responded by pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six-month cease-fire. The RPF cited the CDR and MRND-hardliner violence as its reason for this, but according to foreign policy scholar Bruce D. Jones the offensive may actually have been intended primarily to increase the rebels' bargaining power at the peace talks. The next subject for the negotiations was the proportion of troops and officers to be allocated to each side in the new unified army. By demonstrating its military power in the field, through a successful offensive against the Rwandan Government forces, the RPF was able to secure an increased percentage of troops in the agreement. The RPF began its offensive on 8February, fighting southwards from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and 1991‚Äì1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met by weak resistance from the Rwandan Army forces. The likely reason was a significant deterioration in morale and military experience within the government forces. The impact of the long-running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc, had left the government struggling to pay its soldiers regularly. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one-year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians. The RPF advance continued unchecked in February, its forces moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition. They took Ruhengeri on the first day of fighting, and later the city of Byumba. Local Hutu civilians fled en masse from the areas the RPF were taking, most of them ending up in refugee camps on the outskirts of Kigali. The civilian cost of the offensive is unclear; according to Andr√© Guichaoua several thousand were killed, while Prunier labelled the RPF killing as \\"small-scale\\". This violence alienated the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties. When it became clear that the Rwandan Army was losing ground to the RPF, Habyarimana requested urgent assistance from France. Fearing that the RPF could soon be in a position to seize Kigali, the French immediately dispatched 150 troops to Rwanda, along with arms and ammunition, to bolster the Rwandan Army forces. A further 250 French soldiers were sent on 20 February. The arrival of French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards. By 20 February the RPF had advanced to within of the capital, Kigali, and many observers believed an assault on the city was imminent. The assault did not take place, and the RPF instead declared a cease-fire. Whether or not the RPF intended to advance on the capital is unknown. Kagame later said his aim at this point was to inflict as much damage as possible on Rwandan Army forces, capture their weapons, and gain ground slowly, but not to attack the capital or seek to end the war with an outright RPF victory. Kagame told journalist and author Stephen Kinzer such a victory would have ended international goodwill towards the RPF and led to charges that the war had simply been a bid to replace the Hutu state with a Tutsi one. The increased presence of French troops and the fierce loyalty of the Hutu population to the government meant an invasion of Kigali would not have been achieved with the same ease that the RPF had conquered the north. Fighting for the capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation. Several of Kagame's senior officers urged him to go for outright victory but he overruled them. By the end of the February war more than a million civilians, mostly Hutu, had left their homes in the country's largest exodus to date. =Arusha Accords and rise of Hutu Power, 1993‚Äì1994= The alt=Photograph showing the front entrance of the Arusha International Conference Centre The RPF cease-fire was followed by two days of negotiations in the Ugandan capital Kampala, attended by RPF leader Paul Kagame, and involving President Museveni and representatives of European nations. The Europeans insisted that RPF forces withdraw to the zone they had held before the February offensive. Kagame responded that he would agree to this only if the Rwandan army were forbidden from re-entering the newly conquered territory. Following a threat by Kagame to resume fighting and potentially take even more territory, the two sides reached a compromise deal. This entailed the RPF withdrawing to its pre-February territory, but also mandated the setting up of a demilitarised zone between the RPF area and the rest of the country. The deal was significant because it marked a formal concession by Habyarimana's regime of the northern zone to the rebels, recognising the RPF hold on that territory. There were many within the RPF senior command who felt Kagame had ceded too much, because the deal meant not only withdrawal to the pre-February boundaries, but also a promise not to encroach on the demilitarised zone. This therefore ended RPF ambitions of capturing more territory. Kagame used the authority he had accumulated through his successful leadership of the RPF to override these concerns, and the parties returned once more to the negotiating table in Arusha. Despite the agreement and ongoing negotiations President Habyarimana, supported by the French Government, spent the subsequent months forging a \\"common front\\" against the RPF. This included members of his own party and the CDR and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power-sharing coalition. At the same time other members of the same parties issued a statement, in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full. The hardline factions within the parties became known as Hutu Power, a movement which transcended party politics. Apart from the CDR there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement. Instead almost every party was split into \\"moderate\\" and \\"Power\\" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party. Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal. Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the Interahamwe, which was attached to the ruling party, and the CDR's Impuzamugambi. The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country. The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware the training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings. By June President Habyarimana had come to view Hutu Power, rather than the mainstream opposition, as the biggest threat to his leadership. This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion. According to Prunier this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process. The negotiation of troop numbers was protracted and difficult; twice the talks almost collapsed. The Rwandan Government wanted to allocate only 15% of the officer corps to the RPF, reflecting the proportion of Tutsi in the country, while the RPF was arguing for a 50/50 split. The RPF were in a superior position following their successful February campaign and were backed in their demands by Tanzania, which was chairing the talks. The government eventually agreed to their demands. As well as 50% of the officer corps, the RPF was allocated up to 40% of the non-command troops. The deal also mandated large- scale demobilisation; of the 35,000 Rwandan Army and 20,000 RPF soldiers at the time of the accords, only 19,000 would be drafted into the new national army. With all details agreed the Arusha Accords were finally signed on 4August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries. An uneasy peace was once again entered into, which would last until 7April of the following year. The agreement called for a United Nations peacekeeping force; this was titled the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), and was in place in Rwanda by October 1993 under the command of Canadian General Rom√©o Dallaire. Another stipulation of the agreement was that the RPF would station diplomats in Kigali at the Conseil national de d√©veloppement (CND), now known as the Chamber of Deputies, Rwanda's Parliament building. These men were protected by 600‚Äì1,000 RPF soldiers, who arrived in Kigali through UNAMIR's Operation Clean Corridor in December 1993. Meanwhile, the Hutu Power wings of the various parties were beginning plans for a genocide. The President of Burundi, Melchior Ndadaye, who had been elected in June as the country's first ever Hutu president, was assassinated by extremist Tutsi army officers in October 1993. The assassination reinforced the notion among Hutus that the Tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted. The CDR and the Power wings of the other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage. The idea of a \\"final solution\\", which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint, was now top of their agenda. An informant from the Interahamwe told UNAMIR officials a group of Hutu extremists were planning on disrupting the peace process and killing Tutsis in Kigali. =Military operations during the 1994 genocide= alt=Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994 The cease-fire ended abruptly on 6April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the new President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira. The pair were returning home from a regional summit in Dar es Salaam at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying the implementation of the Arusha accords. The attackers remain unknown. Prunier, in his book written shortly after the incident, concluded that it was most likely a coup carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Brugui√®re and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible. At the end of 2010 the Judges succeeding Brugui√®re ordered a more thorough scientific examination, which employed experts in ballistics and acoustics. This report seemed to reaffirm the initial theory that Hutu extremists assassinated Habyarimana. But the report did not lead the judges to drop the charges against the RPF suspects; this was finally done in 2018, due to lack of evidence. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours. A crisis committee was formed by the military, headed by Colonel Th√©oneste Bagosora, which refused to recognise Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana as leader, even though she was legally next in the line of political succession. UN commander General Dallaire labelled this a coup and insisted that Uwilingiyimana be placed in charge, but Bagosora refused. The Presidential Guard killed Uwilingiyimana and her husband during the night, along with ten Belgian UNAMIR soldiers charged with her protection and other prominent moderate politicians and journalists. The crisis committee appointed an interim government, still effectively controlled by Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, as well as some politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed. On 7 April, as the genocide started, RPF commander Paul Kagame warned the interim government and the United Nations peacekeepers that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day Rwandan Army forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. The RPF then crossed the demilitarised zone from their territory in the north and began an attack on three fronts, leaving their opponents unsure of their true intentions or whether an assault on Kigali was imminent. UNAMIR contingents in the demilitarised zone withdrew to their camps to avoid being caught in the fighting. Kagame refused to talk to the interim government, believing it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule and not committed to ending the genocide. Over the next few days the RPF moved steadily south through the eastern part of the country, capturing Gabiro and large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali. Their unit stationed in Kigali was isolated from the rest of their forces but a unit of young soldiers successfully crossed government-held territory to link up with them. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba at this stage but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF also allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF controlled areas. In April there were numerous attempts by the United Nations forces to establish a cease-fire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April the RPF secured the whole of the Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the Rwandan Army forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far north-west. As well as fighting the war Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and Rwandan Tutsi refugees who had been living in Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits. French soldiers in Kigali, August 1994 In late June 1994 France launched Op√©ration Turquoise, a UN-mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for displaced persons, refugees, and civilians in danger. From bases in the Zairian cities of Goma and Bukavu, the French entered south- western Rwanda and established the Turquoise zone, within the Cyangugu‚ÄìKibuye‚ÄìGikongoro triangle, an area occupying approximately a fifth of Rwanda. Radio France International estimates that Turquoise saved around 15,000 lives, but with the genocide coming to an end and the RPF's ascendancy, many Rwandans interpreted Turquoise as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF and their presence held up the RPF's advance in the south- west of the country. Op√©ration Turquoise remained in Rwanda until 21 August 1994. Having completed the encirclement of Kigali, the RPF spent the latter half of June fighting for the capital. The Rwandan Army forces had superior manpower and weapons, but the RPF steadily gained territory and conducted raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines. According to Dallaire, this success was due to Kagame's being a \\"master of psychological warfare\\"; he exploited the fact that the Rwandan Army were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali and exploited the government's loss of morale as it lost territory. The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan Army in Kigali on 4July and on 18 July took Gisenyi and the rest of the north-west, forcing the interim government into Zaire. This RPF victory ended the genocide as well as the civil war. At the end of July 1994 Kagame's forces held the whole of Rwanda except for the Turquoise zone in the south-west. The date of the fall of Kigali, 4July, was later designated Liberation Day by the RPF and is commemorated as a public holiday in Rwanda. The UN peacekeeping force, UNAMIR, was in Rwanda during the genocide, but its Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily. Efforts by General Dallaire to broker peace were unsuccessful, and most of UNAMIR's Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate. Its most significant contribution was to provide refuge for thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu at its headquarters in Amahoro Stadium, as well as other secure UN sites, and to assist with the evacuation of foreign nationals. The Belgian Government, which had been one of the largest troop contributors to UNAMIR, pulled out in mid-April following the deaths of its ten soldiers protecting Prime Minister Uwilingiliyimana. In mid-May the UN conceded that \\"acts of genocide may have been committed\\", and agreed to reinforcement. The new soldiers started arriving in June, and following the end of the genocide in July they stayed to maintain security and stability, until the termination of their mission in 1996. Fifteen UN soldiers were killed in Rwanda between April and July 1994, including the ten Belgians, three Ghanaians, an Uruguayan, and Senegalese Mbaye Diagne who risked his life repeatedly to save Rwandans. Aftermath alt=Overhead view of Kagame and Perry seated on leather seats with a large microphone visible and another army member in the background The victorious RPF assumed control of Rwanda following the genocide, and as of 2020 remain the dominant political force in the country. They formed a government loosely based on the Arusha Accords, but Habyarimana's party was outlawed and the RPF took over the government positions allocated to it in the accords. The military wing of the RPF was renamed as the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) and became the national army. Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of Vice President of Rwanda and Minister of Defence; Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF, was appointed president. Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs but Kagame remained commander-in-chief of the army and de facto ruler of the country. =Domestic situation= Rwanda's infrastructure and economy suffered greatly during the genocide. Many buildings were uninhabitable and the former regime had taken all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country. Human resources were severely depleted, with over of the population having fled or been killed. Outside of civilian deaths, 7,500 combatants had been killed. Many of the remainder were traumatised: most had lost relatives, witnessed killings, or participated in the genocide. The long-term effects of war rape included social isolation, sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies and babies, some women resorting to self- induced abortions. The army, led by Paul Kagame, maintained law and order while the government began the work of rebuilding the country's institutions and infrastructure. Non-governmental organisations began to move back into the country but the international community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime. Most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi-dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa. During the genocide and in the months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting the genocide. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda, who had lost family or friends and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. Human Rights Watch, as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings. In an interview with Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but said they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The killings gained international attention after the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed; the Rwandan Government claimed the death toll was 338. Paul Kagame took over the presidency from Pasteur Bizimungu in 2000 and began a large-scale national development drive, launching a programme to develop Rwanda as a middle income country by 2020. The country began developing strongly on key indicators, including the human development index, health care, and education. Annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged per year, the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45% between 2006 and 2011, and life expectancy rose from 46.6 years in 2000 to 64.3 years in 2018. A period of reconciliation began as well as the establishment of courts for trying genocide suspects. These included the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and Gacaca, a traditional village court system reintroduced to handle the large caseloads involved. =Refugee crisis, insurgency, and Congo wars= alt=View of refugee camp on foggy day, showing tents of various colours and the refugees Following the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were crowded and squalid and tens of thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including cholera and dysentery. They were set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began to rearm in a bid to return to power in Rwanda. By late 1996, Hutu militants from the camps were launching regular cross-border incursions and the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched a counter-offensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group in the Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The refugees fleeing further into Zaire were relentlessly pursued by the RPA under the cover of the AFDL rebellion, killing an estimated 232,000 people. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north-western provinces. By 1999 a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated. As well as dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning a war to remove Mobutu. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. The Rwandan and Ugandan governments supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. They controlled the whole country by May 1997. Mobutu fled into exile and the country was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998 and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the Second Congo War. This lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and severe damage. A 2010 United Nations report accused the Rwandan Patriotic Army of wide-scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity during the two Congo wars, charges denied by the Rwandan Government. In 2015 the Rwandan government paid reparations to Uganda for damage inflicted during the civil war to its border regions.

Pioneer was laid down by Peterson Builders, Inc., Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, on 5 June 1989. Mrs. Sally McGuire Tobin christened the ship on 25 August 1990. Construction and fitting out progressed on schedule and, on 14 August 1990, Lieutenant Commander Jerald Tyler Ballance, USNR, accepted Pioneer on behalf of the Navy from Mr. Ellsworth Peterson of Peterson Builders. Pioneer began her commissioned service on 1 September 1992 and, after completing initial crew training, sailed to her new homeport of NS Ingleside, Texas. Pioneer was formally commissioned on 7 December 1992, a tribute to the many U.S. servicemen who had served at Pearl Harbor. Service history In January 1993, Pioneer began an intense shakedown year filled with numerous evaluations, training periods, exercises, and inspections. These included the first major mine warfare exercise in the western Gulf of Mexico, two visits to the Magnetic Silencing Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, port visits to Port Canaveral and Port Everglades, Florida, an Operational Propulsion Plant Examination, Combat Systems Qualification and Testing in Panama City, Florida, mine sweeping performance trials, Final Contract Trials, and a Logistic Management Assessment. For the remainder of 1993 and throughout 1994, Pioneer continued her aggressive training cycle and conducted post-shakedown maintenance, repairs, and pre-deployment exercises. In February 1995, Pioneer set sail for Europe on her maiden cruise. During this deployment, Pioneer participated in Exercise Blue Harrier '95 and visited Bermuda, Portsmouth England, Aarhus Denmark, Kiel Germany, Russia, Azores, La Spezia Italy, and Cartagena, Spain, Palma de Mallorca and Benidorm Spain. During her visit to St. Petersburg, the Pioneer and her crew were greeted by hundreds of Russians; eager to see the Americans that had arrived to participate in the 50th Anniversary of V-E day. She returned to Ingleside in August and, after a well-deserved break, began her next training cycle. In January 1996, Pioneer joined , , and as a training ship for the Mine Force's Rotational Crews. For the next four years, the Navy's eight Mine Countermeasures Rotational Crews conducted their pre- deployment training in these Ingleside-based ships before completing a six- month deployment in the Persian Gulf in or . But by early 2000, the Navy no longer manned its forward-deployed MCM ships with rotational crews, and on 20 January 2000, the remaining members of MCM Rotational Crew BRAVO embarked in Pioneer--a ship they knew well--as her permanent crew. Pioneer now serves in Mine Countermeasures Squadron 1 (MCMRon 1), the squadron responsible for planning and overseeing the Navy's Mine Countermeasures operations in the Western Pacific. The crew moved aboard and quickly made the ship their home by resealing decks, painting, and generally taking ownership. Along with this came a plethora of repairs and upgrades, which increased Pioneers material readiness. Pioneer then completed a successful CART II and N43 visit and made its way to Panama City, Florida for a Squadron 1 exercise. En route to this exercise, LCDR Samuel Norton relieved CDR Clay Harris as Commanding Officer of Pioneer. The crew remained focussed and performed admirably during the Mine Warfare Exercise. Following a brief port visit to Tampa, Florida, the ship returned to Ingleside, Texas to complete preparations for another mine warfare exercise (GOMEX 2000). Pioneer participated in the exercise off the coast of Corpus Christi, Texas and the ship and crew's performance was outstanding. With precision and polish, they led the way for mine countermeasures. Members of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 3's Detachment 15 aided Pioneer in this task. Pioneer then prepared to make its first extended underway period with a permanent crew since 1995. On 12 September 2000 Pioneer set off for Beaumont, Texas for Navy Days, its first stop on an East Coast cruise. During this period Pioneer participated in Unified Spirit 2000, a multi-national exercise off the coast of North Carolina. Pioneer again identified and neutralized its fair share of mines, aided by members of Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic 8, a Canadian Explosive Ordnance Disposal dive team. The crew worked well with the divers, and claimed a few victories with its Mine Neutralization Vehicle, performing the first live activation of a Mission Package One cutter arm since USS Pioneer gained its permanent crew, bringing a moored mine safely to the surface and completing the neutralization and recovery. Pioneer then began her journey back to homeport, stopping again in NAB Little Creek, Virginia and briefly in Key West, Florida en route to Mobile, Alabama--the last stop before returning to Ingleside. In Mobile Pioneer was once again greeted by the warm southern hospitality for the members of the Mobile Navy League and the people of Mobile as a whole. Pioneer bid Mobile a fond farewell as she traveled to Ingleside, Texas returning on 15 December 2000. Following the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Pioneer was ordered out-to-sea as a part of Joint Task Force Katrina. During her underway time, Pioneer was tasked with conducting sonar sweeps and maritime safety checks of the shipping lanes off the coast of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. The ship and crew, MCM Crew Exultant, were awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for their work during the operation. The ship has since shifted her homeport to San Diego, California in 2009.

It was formerly known as Murray Bay. The development of tourism in this area is said to date back to 1760, when the Scottish feudal lords John Nairne and Malcolm Fraser began receiving visitors to the region at their estates. The Manoir Richelieu (currently serving as a hotel) and Casino de Charlevoix are both located in the neighbourhood and former municipality of Pointe-au-Pic. History In 1608, Samuel de Champlain visited the area. He could not find suitable anchorage for his ship in the bay and therefore named it Malle Baye (archaic French for \\"bad bay\\"), a name further justified when during low tide the bay dried up and his ships ran aground. In 1761, two Scottish officers of the British Army were attracted to the beauty of the place, and they each sought to obtain a concession. John Nairne (1731‚Äì1802) received the western shores of the Malbaie River, that he thereafter called the Seignory of Murray Bay that included the settlement of La Malbaie. Malcolm Fraser (1733‚Äì1815) was granted the eastern part that became the Seignory of Mount Murray. They also renamed the bay, the settlement, and river after James Murray (1721‚Äì1794), British General and successor of Wolfe. Although this name never received official approval, in the 18th and 19th centuries Murray Bay had become the internationally accepted toponym, but La Malbaie remained in local use. In 1774, the Parish of Saint-√âtienne was formed. In 1845, the place was first incorporated as the Municipality of La Malbaie, but it was abolished in 1847.La Malbaie, postcard, c. 1920 Murray Bay wharf, circa 1912 It was reestablished in 1855 as the Parish Municipality of Saint-√âtienne-de-Murray- Bay. In 1896, the village itself separated from the parish municipality and was incorporated as the Village Municipality of La Malbaie. Murray Bay is the site of the summer home of the Taft family, including U.S. President William Howard Taft. The residents of Murray Bay were very demonstrative in their affection for Taft, referring to him as \\"le petit juge,\\" lifting their caps to him as he drove by, and performing burlesque sketches during the winter months in which he was played by the largest villager. They burned a candle at the time of his death, and spat upon hearing of his betrayal by Theodore Roosevelt. In 1957, Saint-√âtienne-de-Murray-Bay was renamed to Saint-Etienne- de-la-Malbaie. A year later, the Village Municipality of La Malbaie changed status and became the Town of La Malbaie, that annexed the parish municipality in 1965. On February 15, 1995, the Town of La Malbaie and the Village Municipality of Pointe-au-Pic merged to form the Town of La Malbaie‚ÄìPointe-au- Pic. On December 1, 1999, the Municipalities of Rivi√®re-Malbaie and Saint- Fid√®le, the Village Municipality of Cap-√†-l'Aigle, the Parish Municipality of Sainte-Agn√®s, and the Town of La Malbaie‚ÄìPointe-au-Pic were amalgamated to form the new Town of La Malbaie. La Malbaie is the seat of the judicial district of Charlevoix.Territorial Division Act. Revised Statutes of Quebec D-11. In June 2018, La Malbaie hosted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and world leaders at the 44th G7 summit. Seismic hazard La Malbaie is located in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone, which is the most active seismic zone in Eastern Canada. La Malbaie is notable for having an extremely high seismic risk, although a significant earthquake has not occurred in the region recently.

They are sequels to the Game Boy Color game Robopon. Their simultaneous release is similar to how the Pok√©mon series of video games are released in pairs of games (such as Pok√©mon Red and Blue) to promote inter-connectivity between them. The games are a sequel to the earlier 2000 Game Boy Color game Robopon Sun. The Robopon bears much similarity to Nintendo's series of Pok√©mon games, and thus is often considered to be a Pok√©mon clone, but also bears similarity to the lesser known Super Nintendo Entertainment System game Robotrek, released by the Japanese game company Enix (now Square Enix). Story After the events of the first game, the now number one Legend of Porombo Island, Cody, sets out for new lands and new titles, but forgets his Robopon. Before he can turn back to retrieve them, his boat is wrecked in a storm, and he washes up on the continent of Majiko. He decides to become the Robopon champion of this land; however, in order to do this, he must obtain the one-of-a-kind XStones and challenge the rank-holders of Majiko. As he collects the XStones, however, he finds the towns of Majiko are troubled by events past and present, and he must travel between the world of 20 years ago and the present to make things right. Gameplay Within both versions of Robopon 2, Robopon can be created by finding different types of batteries and combining them (this process in known as \\"sparking\\"). Each different combination of batteries produces a different type of Robopon. Robopon 2 also builds upon the battle system of the first game by implementing four-on-four battles, allowing the player's whole party of Robopons to participate in one big battle. Subsequently, targeting certain enemies within battles becomes crucial. Another less drastic change from Robopon is the ability to change the colour of the player's Robopon.

The term Sixty Years' War is used by academic historians to provide a framework for viewing this era as a whole. David Skaggs defines the Sixty Years' War in six phases: # French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) Canadians view this war as the American theater of the Seven Years' War, whereas Americans view it as an isolated American conflict with no bearing on European conflicts. Some scholars interpret this war as part of a larger struggle between the Kingdoms of Great Britain and France; most historians view it as a conflict between the colonies of British America and those of New France, each supported by various Indian tribes with some assistance from the \\"mother country\\". Both sides sought control of the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region, known in New France as the \\"upper country\\" (the pays d'en haut). Indians of the pays d'en haut had longstanding trade relations with the French and generally fought alongside the French. The Iroquois Confederacy attempted to remain neutral in the conflict, except for the Mohawks who fought as British allies. British conquest of New France marked the end of French colonial power in the region and the establishment of British rule in Canada. # Pontiac's War (1763‚Äì1765) American Indian allies of the defeated French launched a war against the British due to dissatisfaction with their handling of tribal diplomacy, eventually leading to a negotiated truce. # Lord Dunmore's War (1774) The expansion of colonial Virginia into the Ohio Country sparked a war with Ohio Indians, primarily Shawnees and Mingos, forcing them to cede their hunting ground south of the Ohio River (Kentucky) to Virginia. # Western theater of the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783) The Royal Proclamation of 1763 prohibited American colonists from settling the lands acquired from France at the conclusion of the French and Indian War, but this caused resentment among the colonists and is often cited as one of the causes of the American Revolutionary War. The war spilled onto the frontier, with British commanders in Canada working with American Indian allies to provide a strategic diversion from the primary battles in the east. Many conflicts in this western theater would harden the animosity between the native nations and the United States, but with their losses in the war, Great Britain ceded the Old Northwest, home of many of Britain's Indian allies, to the United States without consulting their native allies. # Northwest Indian War (1785‚Äì1795) A large confederation of American Indians resisted American expansion into the Old Northwest. The United States won the Battle of Fallen Timbers after numerous defeats and gained control of most of Ohio. # War of 1812 (1812‚Äì1814) A number of American Indians under the leadership of Tecumseh continued to resist American hegemony and expansion in the Northwest, suffering a defeat in the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. The United States declared war on Great Britain in 1812, and the British once again turned to American Indians to provide manpower for their frontier war effort. This included the Battle of Fort Dearborn. The war between the United States and British Canada ended as a stalemate, establishing the Great Lakes as a permanent boundary between the two nations.

It provides significant transportation in the area. Origin Most of the streams that ultimately form the Apure originate in the Venezuelan highlands of the Cordillera de M√©rida and only some minor affluents of the Sarare River come from the Cordillera Oriental in the Colombian Andes, entering Venezuela at the confluence with the Oir√° River which has a very narrow and steep valley and forms the border between the two countries for . The Oir√° River starts in Venezuela and its thalweg forms that border for several kilometres downstream. The Uribante River is longer than the Sarare and flows from the T√°chira-M√©rida border, near the town of Pregonero. The Apure's drainage area thus includes the slopes of both the Colombian (less than 0.5 percent of its total area) and the Venezuelan Andes. Course Erosion at the left bank of the Apure river, near the small town of El Sam√°n (Apure State, Venezuela) From the point where the Uribante joins the Sarare, the Apure flows eastward across the Venezuelan llanos, into the Orinoco. The Apure flows primarily through Apure State including San Fernando before joining the Orinoco River via six braided river branches west of Cabruta, Gu√°rico State, across from Caicara, Bol√≠var State, at about . The Apure is long from the Uribante's starting point to the Orinoco.Church, George Earl (1901) \\"South America: An Outline of Its Physical Geography\\" The Geographical Journal 17(4): pp. 333-406, p. 363 It is navigable for about above the Orinoco, where it has a sluggish course across the llanos, despite rapids at about the mark. From the north, its principal tributaries are the Caparo, Portuguesa and Guarico. The Caucagua is its only major tributary from the south. Because of the flatness of the land its meanders and bayous to the south are mingled with those of the Arauca River creating an extensive area which is flooded annually. However, both rivers keep independent channels during dry season. Notes  References  *Acosta Saignes, Miguel. ¬øC√≥mo se descubri√≥ el r√≠o Apure?.

He was a Member of Parliament and co-leader of the Green Party. Norman resigned as an MP in October 2015 to work as Executive Director of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand.  Early life  Norman was born in Brisbane, Australia, and worked a number of unskilled roles after dropping out of medical school. As a student in Queensland, his first ever vote in 1986 was motivated by the desire to oust the Premier of Queensland at the time, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Whilst living in Australia, Norman was involved with the Democratic Socialist Party for several years, and contested the House of Representatives for the party at the 1990 federal election, placing fifth of five candidates in the seat of Griffith. Norman moved to New Zealand in 1997, saying this was to observe the red-green Alliance coalition. He wrote his political science PhD thesis on the Alliance, and was active within the party, editing its party newsletter.  Involvement in politics  In New Zealand Norman became involved in organic farming, and was active in the Auckland branch of the Green Party, helping to set up the Waiheke branch. Later, he worked as an assistant to Green MPs Sue Kedgley, N√°ndor T√°nczos and Keith Locke. He was a researcher for the party from 2002 to 2004 and was the national campaign manager prior to the 2005 election and the national Party Development Co-ordinator afterwards. Following the death of Rod Donald, Norman put his name forward as a contender for the male co-leader position. He won the position on 3 June 2006 at the annual meeting, beating Tanczos, David Clendon and former MP Mike Ward in an STV vote by delegates from electorates around the country. = Member of Parliament = In the 2002 election general election, Norman contested the Rimutaka electorate, where he placed fourth. He was ranked seventeenth on the Green Party list. In the 2005 election, he did not contest an electorate, but was ranked tenth on the Green Party list. On 27 June 2008 Norman was declared elected to parliament when Tanczos resigned after Ward and Catherine Delahunty, who were above Norman on the party list, agreed to stand aside. In the 2008 general election Norman stood in the Rongotai electorate against senior Labour Cabinet Minister Annette King. He placed third in the electorate, but was second on his party's list, and so was returned to parliament. Norman stood as the Green Party's candidate for the Mount Albert by-election in 2009, following the resignation of Prime Minister Helen Clark. Norman came third with 12.09% of the vote. In June 2010, Norman claimed he was assaulted by Chinese security staff when he protested against a visiting Chinese delegation of the Vice President Xi Jinping with a Tibetan snow lion flag. Norman lodged a complaint of assault with the New Zealand Police and the Speaker of the House, but police did not find enough evidence to substantiate his claims. = Retirement = In January 2015, shortly after the birth of his third child, Norman announced he would stand down as co- leader of the Green Party. However, he said he would remain as a Green MP for the foreseeable future. He named what he saw as his key political victories as co-leader as: forcing the Government to reverse its decision to allow mining on Schedule 4 conservation land, and leading a campaign and referendum against National's asset sales programme. Norman was succeeded by James Shaw as co- leader on 30 May 2015. On 11 September 2015, Norman announced that he would resign in October as an MP, and that he would also formally resign from the Green Party, prior to taking on the role of Executive Director of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand. This enabled the next person on the Green Party list, Marama Davidson, to become a member of parliament. In his valedictory speech in Parliament, he spoke about the loss of democracy in New Zealand, and said there were significant problems regarding access to official information.  Private life  Norman and his partner, Katya Paquin (sister of Anna Paquin), live with their two sons and a daughter in Hataitai. In 2012 when Norman and David Shearer shaved their heads for a cancer appeal, he revealed that he had had a melanoma mole removed from his forearm at age 15, leaving a 10 cm scar. In 2014, Norman was awarded a Bravo award by the New Zealand Skeptics for responding to Steffan Browning's comments on homeopathy stating, \\"stating that this was not something the Green Party would support as they take 'an evidence based approach.'\\"  References   External links  *Profile at the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand (archived) *Profile, NZ Parliament website *Russel Norman at the Greens' blog 1967 births Living people Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand MPs Leaders of political parties in New Zealand New Zealand bloggers Australian emigrants to New Zealand Politicians from Brisbane New Zealand list MPs Unsuccessful candidates in the 2002 New Zealand general election Unsuccessful candidates in the 2005 New Zealand general election Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives 21st-century New Zealand politicians ","title":"Russel Norman"},{"id":"1796714","text":"The People's Republic of China competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. 244 competitors, 117 men and 127 women, took part in 144 events in 23 sports.

Life  Maria of Antioch was the daughter of Constance of Antioch and her first husband Raymond of Poitiers. In 1160, Maria's stepfather Raynald of Ch√¢tillon was taken prisoner by Maj al-Dƒ´n, the ruler of Aleppo and an ally of N≈´r al-Dƒ´n. Her mother claimed the Principality of Antioch for herself, but the nobles supported her son, Maria's brother Bohemund III. King Baldwin III of Jerusalem set Bohemund III up as prince and appointed as regent the rich and worldly Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch and an old opponent of Raynald. Constance protested this decision in Constantinople at the court of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos, the nominal overlord of Antioch. =Empress= At the end of 1159, Manuel's wife Empress Eirene (originally named Bertha of Sulzbach) had died, and Manuel wanted to marry a princess from one of the Crusader states. John Kontostephanos, the chief dragoman (interpreter) Theophylact, and the akolouthos of the Varangian Guard Basil Kamateros were sent to Jerusalem to seek a new wife, and the two princesses Maria of Antioch and Melisende of Tripoli, a daughter of Count Raymond II of Tripoli by Hodierna of Jerusalem, were offered as candidates. Both were renowned for their beauty, but according to John Kinnamos Maria was the more beautiful of the two; the tall, blonde-haired princess clearly showed her Norman ancestry. King Baldwin III suggested Melisende, and her brother Count Raymond III of Tripoli set about gathering an enormous dowry, with gifts from Hodierna and from Melisende's namesake, her aunt Queen Melisende. The ambassadors were not satisfied and delayed the marriage for over a year; they had apparently heard rumours concerning Hodierna's infidelity and therefore Melisende's possible legitimacy. Instead, Manuel chose Maria. Count Raymond was insulted and in retaliation attacked Byzantine Cyprus. Meanwhile, an imperial embassy led by Alexios Bryennios Komnenos and the prefect of Constantinople, John Kamateros, came to Antioch to negotiate the marriage. Maria embarked from the port of St. Simeon for Constantinople in September 1161, and the marriage took place in Hagia Sophia on December 24. Three patriarchs performed the marriage: Luke Chrysoberges, Patriarch of Constantinople; Sophronios, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria, and Athanasios I, Greek Patriarch of Antioch. The marriage was celebrated with feasts, gifts to the church, and chariot races in the Hippodrome for the people. This strengthened the connection of Antioch to the Byzantine Empire. The marriage also strengthened the position of Maria's mother Constance, who now held the regency of Antioch. According to Niketas Choniates, Maria > \\"...was like unto the laughter-loving, golden Aphrodite, the white-armed and > ox-eyed Hera, the long-necked and beautiful ankled Laconian, whom the > ancients deified for their beauty, and all the rest of the beauties whose > good looks have been preserved in distinguished books and histories.\\" For several years, Maria was childless. In 1166 she had her first pregnancy, but miscarried a son, a fact which was considered a tragedy by the Emperor and the population.Garland, Lynda, & Stone, Andrew, \\"Maria of Antioch, Byzantine Empress\\", De Imperatoribus Romanis (external link) In 1169 Maria finally gave birth to a son, the future emperor Alexios II Komnenos. She played a role in the political and diplomatic life of Constantinople. French being her mother tongue, she was able to observe the double-dealing of the hypoboleus (court interpreter) Aaron Isaakios, who was quietly advising Westerners not to pay too much for the Emperor's favour. As a result, Manuel had Aaron blinded.Niketas Choniates, Histories p. 147 van Dieten. =Regency= After the death of Manuel in 1180, Maria officially became a nun with the name \\"Xene\\" (translated foreigner), but in reality she acted as regent for their son Alexios II. Despite being a nun she had many ambitious suitors, but she chose another Alexios, the pr≈çtosebastos and pr≈çtovestiarios, a nephew of Manuel and uncle of Maria Komnene, former queen of Jerusalem, as an advisor and lover, causing a scandal among the Greek population. As a Westerner who favoured the Italian merchants, Maria was opposed by the Greeks, and her regency was widely considered incompetent. The leaders of the opposition were her stepdaughter, the porphyrogenita Maria Komnene and her husband, the Caesar Renier of Montferrat, though himself a fellow Latin. The porphyrogenita Maria may have considered herself the rightful heir, as the elder child of Manuel; she was almost as old as her stepmother Maria. Maria and Renier gained the support of the Patriarch Theodosius I and used Hagia Sophia as a base of operations. Alexios had the patriarch arrested, leading to open warfare on the streets of Constantinople. = Execution = Manuel's cousin Andronikos Komnenos, who had been exiled during Manuel's reign, was invited back by the porphyrogenita Maria, and marched on Constantinople in 1182. He provoked the citizens into a massacre of the Latin inhabitants, mostly Venetian and Genoese merchants. After gaining control of the city, he had the Porphyrogenita and Renier poisoned, and then had Empress Maria arrested and imprisoned in the monastery of St. Diomedes or in a prison nearby. The empress tried to seek help from her brother-in-law King B√©la III of Hungary, to no avail. Andronikos had Alexios II sign the order for his mother's execution, and appointed his own son Manuel and the sebastos George to execute her, but they refused. Instead, according to Niketas, Maria was strangled by the hetaireiarches Constantine Tripsychos and the eunuch Pterygeonites, and buried in an unmarked grave on a nearby beach.Niketas Choniates, Histories pp. 267-269 van Dieten; cf. Eustathios of Thessalonica, Sack of Thessalonica. Presumably owing to the secrecy surrounding her death, alternative versions of her death circulated, such as that she was tied up in a sack and drowned.Roger of Howden, Annals 1180. Andronikos had himself crowned co-emperor, but Alexios II was soon murdered as well, and Andronikos took full control of the empire. Sometime later Andronikos also defaced or destroyed most images of Maria in Constantinople. Notes Sources *Lynda Garland, Byzantine Empresses: Woman and Power in Byzantium, AD 527-1204.

It is a common practice of drug addicts, suppliers to drug addicts, hypochondriacs or patients of factitious disorder and factitious disorder imposed on another. A doctor who, for a price, will write prescriptions without the formality of a medical exam or diagnosis is known as a \\"writer\\" or \\"writing doctor\\".  Description  A doctor shopper will visit multiple health care providers as a \\"new patient\\" or \\"visiting from out of town,\\" and will exaggerate or feign medical problems to obtain prescriptive medications or a wanted medical opinion, diagnosis or treatment with no specific material gain. = For prescription drugs = Frequently involved in prescription fraud are narcotics, stimulants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tranquilizers and other psychoactive substances manufactured for use in legitimate medical treatment. Law enforcement officers spend a significant amount of time investigating cases involving prescription fraud, many of which also involve insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid fraud. Prescription drug diversion occurs by faking, forging, or altering a prescription; obtaining bogus prescriptions from criminal medical practitioners; or buying drugs diverted from health care facilities by personnel. Pharmacy thefts are increasing throughout the United States to feed the growing demand for prescription drugs. The rising cost of prescription drugs has also enticed senior citizens to join in the diversion and to sell their prescriptions. Doctor shopping is a kind of malingering with the specific goal of procuring prescription drugs. Malingering is underdiagnosed, often because of the physician's fear of making false accusations. Covert surveillance has indicated that as many as 20% of pain clinic patients misrepresent the extent of their disability. The judgment of the morality of malingering is largely a matter of the observer and circumstances. Most people would regard the defraudment of an insurance company, by a false injury, as an antisocial act. In contrast, the malingering of a prisoner-of-war, who is attempting to manipulate his or her captors, would be seen by most compatriots as a skillful coping mechanism. Doctor shopping is associated with the ubiquitous medicalization of drug use, as an alternative to criminalization and legalization. = In hypochondriasis and factitious disorders = Some patients of hypochondria, factitious disorder and factitious disorder imposed on another will visit multiple health care providers to find a medical opinion, diagnosis or treatment that they feel the need to get, not specifically in search of prescription drugs, for no material benefit and even incurring in significant costs, debts or losses. This kind of doctor shopping lacks intention to commit malingering for material gain and is the result of such mental conditions.

She was the third ship named USS Hopkins and the third named for Esek Hopkins. Construction and commissioning Hopkins was launched 26 June 1920 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Sarah Babbitt, a descendant of Esek Hopkins; and commissioned 21 March 1921 at Philadelphia, Lieutenant Commander C. A. Bailey commanding. Service history After shakedown Hopkins arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, 31 May for battle practice training during the summer. In November, she was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 15 for tactical training with the Atlantic Fleet along the East Coast. Hopkins sailed from Hampton Roads 2 October 1922, and reached Constantinople 22 October for duty in Turkish waters. She protected American interests and cooperated with the relief mission in the Near East, ranging to Beirut, Jaffa, and Smyrna. She departed Constantinople 18 May 1923 for New York, arriving 12 June. For the next seven years, Hopkins operated out of New England ports in the summer, Charleston, South Carolina, in the winter, and the Caribbean Sea in the spring. During the spring of 1930, Hopkins participated in force battle practice with aircraft. On 3 February 1932, Hopkins was one of the two naval ships rendering medical aid to earthquake victims at Santiago, Cuba. She departed 5 February to join the Pacific Fleet at San Diego, California. She had escort duty for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's cruise to Canada in July 1936, then resumed training along the Western Seaboard. Hopkins returned to Norfolk, Virginia in April 1939, and performed Neutrality Patrol from September 1939 until sailing for San Diego 37 May, and from there to Pearl Harbor. She converted to a high-speed minesweeper (DMS-13) in the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. =World War II= When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Hopkins was at Johnston Island for war maneuvers, but immediately headed back to Hawaii. She continued patrol of the Hawaiian Sea Frontier, with a short break for overhaul in the States, until late summer 1942, when she joined the invasion fleet bound for Guadalcanal. As America's first offensive of the Pacific war began 7 August, Hopkins swept the transport area and covered the landings on Tulagi. During a heavy enemy air attack 9 August, she shot down two enemy planes, and in the following months, Hopkins escorted transports, swept mines, and carried badly needed supplies to Guadalcanal. Hopkins off Guadalcanal, 8 August 1942. Hopkins served as flagship for Admiral Richmond K. \\"Kelly\\" Turner as the Russell Islands were invaded 21 February 1943. During the action, she shot down a Japanese plane. Remaining in the southwest Pacific, she joined in the initial invasion of Rice Anchorage, New Georgia, 4 July, and of Bougainville 1 November. Convoy escort, antisubmarine patrol, and sweeping duties kept the destroyer busy until the Solomon Islands were secured. As the Navy moved farther across the Pacific in the island-hopping campaign, Hopkins arrived off Saipan 13 June 1944 to sweep the invasion approaches. She provided screen and fire support for the amphibious landings of 15 June 1944. She picked up 62 prisoners from sunken Japanese ships as well as rescuing a downed fighter pilot and a seaplane crew. A brief rest at Eniwetok was followed by a role in the capture of Guam. Hopkins reached that important Marianas island 14 July to participate in the preinvasion sweeping and bombardment. She also gave fire-support to the landings 16 July. Following overhaul at San Francisco, CA, Hopkins arrived in Leyte Gulf 27 December 1944 to prepare for the Lingayen landings. The minesweepers sailed 2 January 1945 to sweep Lingayen Gulf under attack from Japanese dive bombers and kamikazes. When her sister ship was hit and sank in 13 minutes the morning of 7 January, Hopkins rescued 94 survivors. Hopkins departed the Philippines 15 January 1945 for a brief rest at Eniwetok, then swept the transport areas and channels off Iwo Jima to prepare for invasion 19 February 1945. She remained on patrol off Iwo Jima, emerging from heavy air and shore fire unscathed. Departing Iwo Jima 6 March, Hopkins next headed into battle off Okinawa, the \\"last stepping stone to Japan.\\" While fighting off the constant raids and suicide attacks she shot down several Japanese planes. On 4 May 1945 she was struck a glancing blow by a burning kamikaze just before it plunged into the sea. There was one casualty during this attack. Coxswain Morris Dee Garrett was the only casualty on that day and was the only casualty from the USS Hopkins during World War II. On 7 June 1945, Hopkins steamed for overhaul at Leyte, Philippine Islands where she remained until cessation of hostilities. Hopkins then rendezvoused with units of the 3rd Fleet headed for Tokyo Bay. After two days of sweeping the entrances to Tokyo Bay, Hopkins anchored in sight of Mount Fuji 30 August 1945. Hopkins rode out two typhoons with winds raging to 125 knots before her departure from Tokyo Bay 10 October 1945 for the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Hopkins arrived in Norfolk 28 November and decommissioned there 21 December 1945. She was sold for scrapping 8 November 1946 to Heglo Sales Corporation, Hillsdale, New Jersey. Awards Hopkins was awarded two Navy Unit Commendations for heroism off Guadalcanal and in Lingayen Gulf. She also received 10 battle stars for her service in World War II. Hopkins is the most decorated member of the Clemson- class destroyers.

Slowly expanding, it became, in medieval times, a fief of the Clavesana marquis, who was a subject of the Republic of Genoa, to which Cervo had always been faithful. The present character of Cervo dates from these times: 16th-century towers and ramparts still protect the village. One of its main attractions is the fine baroque church of St. John the Baptist, overlooking the sea. The Romanesque Oratorio di Santa Caterina contain 18th-century frescoes. The medieval Clavesana stronghold hosts the Ethnographic Museum of Western Liguria and the Palazzo Viale-Citati. Inhabitants used to earn a living from coral fishing in the Corsican and Sardinian seas, in addition to growing olives and seafaring, but the modern economy of Cervo is based on tourism and agriculture. Cervo's connections with classical music date from to 1964, when the International Chamber Music Festival of Cervo was established by the Hungarian violinist Sandor Vegh.

It is thought that both the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles were written by the same author, and often argued that the two books were originally a single unified work. Both Luke and Acts were written in a refined Koine Greek, and the name \\"Œ∏ŒµœåœÜŒπŒªŒøœÇ\\" (\\"Theophilos\\"), as it appears therein, means friend of GodStrong's G2321 or (be)loved by God or loving GodBauer lexicon, 2nd edition, 1958, page 358 in the Greek language. No one knows the true identity of Theophilus and there are several conjectures and traditions around an identity. In English Theophilus is also written \\"Theophilos\\", both a common name and an honorary title among the learned (academic) Romans and Jews of the era. The life of Theophilus would coincide with the writing of Luke and the author of the Acts.  Theories about who Theophilus was  = Coptic view = Coptic tradition asserts that Theophilus was a person and not an honorary title. The Coptic Church claims that the person was a Jew of Alexandria. Similarly, John Wesley in his Notes on the New Testament recorded that Theophilus was \\"a person of eminent quality at Alexandria\\", which he understood to be the tradition 'of the ancients'.John Wesley, Notes on The Gospel According to St Luke, 1:3 = Roman Official = Others say that Theophilus was probably a Roman official of some sort, because Luke referred to him as kratistos, \\"Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒπœÉœÑŒµ\\" - optime in the Latin Vulgate translation - meaning \\"most excellent\\" (Luke 1:3), although in the parallel introduction to Acts he is simply referred to as 'O Theophilus'. = Honorary title = Honorary title (academia) tradition maintains that Theophilus was not a person. The word in Greek means \\"Friend of God\\" and thus both Luke and Acts were addressed to anyone who fits that description. In this tradition the author's targeted audience, as with all other canonical Gospels, were the learned (academic) but unnamed men and women of the era. Likewise the non- canonical Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of James are not addressed to any particular gender, or any specific person.Redford, Doug. \\"The Life and Ministry of Jesus: The Gospels, vol. 1.\\" Standard ReferenceLibrary: New Testament. Cincinnati, OH: Standard (2007), 15. = Paul's lawyer = Some believe that Theophilus could have been Paul's lawyer during his trial period in Rome.Mauck, 2001 To support this claim people appeal to the formal legalese present in the prologue to the Gospel such as \\"eye witnesses,\\" \\"account,\\" \\"carefully investigated,\\" \\"know the certainty of things which you have been instructed.\\" The conclusion of the Book of Acts ends with Paul still alive and under arrest awaiting trial, suggesting it was the intention of the author to update Theophilus on Paul's history to provide for an explanation of his travels and preaching and serve as evidence in support of his innocence under Roman law. Some also point to the parallel between the account of Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate narrated in Luke's Gospel with the account of Paul's trials before Roman judges in the Book of Acts. In total, Jesus was declared innocent 3 times by Pontius Pilate as was Paul before various judges. = Jewish priest = A growing beliefThe earliest known person to suggest that most excellent Theophilus was none other than the High Priest was Theodore Hase (1682-1731) who contributed an article in 1725 to the Bibliotheca Historico-Philogico-Theologica, referenced as the Bibliotheca Bremensissome in the Introduction to the New Testament by Johann David Michaelis tr. and augmented with notes by Herbert Marsh, although Hase proposed that Luke was written to Theophilus after his years as High Priest. Christian apologist and philosopher William Paley (1743-1805) accepted this identification in his Horae Paulinae. In recent years contributions are in David L. Allen, Lukan Authorship of Hebrews (2010); Richard H. Anderson, Who are Theophilus and Johanna? The Irony of the Intended Audience (2010); \\"Theophilus: A Proposal,\\" Evangelical Quarterly 69:3 (1997) 195-215; \\"The Cross and Atonement from Luke to Hebrews,\\" Evangelical Quarterly71:2 (1999), 127-149; \\"Luke and the Parable of the Wicked Tenants,\\" The Journal of Biblical Studies, January‚ÄìMarch 2001, Vol. 1, No. 1; \\"A la recherche de Theophile,\\" Dossiers d'Archeolgie, December 2002 ‚Äì January 2003; Josep Rius-Camps, Jenny Read-Heimerdinger, The message of Acts in Codex Bezae: a comparison with the Alexandrian tradition, Volume 4, (2009) 3-4 and prior volumes points to Theophilus ben Ananus, High Priest of the Temple in Jerusalem from 37 to 41. In this tradition Theophilus would have been both a kohen and a Sadducee. That would make him the son of Annas and brother-in-law of Caiaphas, raised in the Jewish Temple. Adherents claim that Luke's Gospel was targeted at Sadducee readers. This might explain a few features of Luke. He begins the story with an account of Zacharias the righteous priest who had a Temple vision of an angel (). Luke quickly moves to account Mary's purification (niddah), Jesus' Temple redemption (pidyon ha-ben) rituals (), and then to Jesus' pilgrimage to the Temple when he was twelve (), possibly implying his bar mitzvah. He makes no mention of Caiaphas' role in Jesus' crucifixion and emphasizes Jesus' literal resurrection (), including an ascension into heaven as a realm of spiritual existence (; Acts 1:1). Luke also seems to stress Jesus' arguments with the Sadducees on points like legal grounds for divorce, the existence of angels, spirits, and an afterlife (Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection of the dead). If this was the case then Luke is trying to use Jesus' rebuttals and teachings to break down Theophilus' Sadducean philosophy, maybe with the hope that Theophilus would use his influence to get the Sadducees to cease their persecution of the Christians. One could also look at Luke's Gospel as an allegorical (◊®÷∂◊û÷∂◊ñ remez) reference to Jesus as \\"the man called the Branch\\" prophesied in ; , who is the ultimate high priest foreshadowed by the Levitical priesthood. Most, if not all, of the commentaries on the Gospel of Luke say the \\"Question about the Resurrection\\" pericope presented in Lk. 20:27-40 is the only account in Luke of Jesus confronting the Sadducees. It is true that Luke only mentions the Sadducees by name once but it is not true that this pericope is the only one concerning the Sadducees. The Parables about the Good Samaritan, the Unjust Steward, the Rich Man and Lazarus and the Wicked Tenants are directed to the Sadducees who controlled the temple establishment. These parables are about unfaithful priests. They are the wicked sons of Eli.Anderson, Who are Theophilus and Johanna?: The Irony of the Intended Audience of the Gospel of Luke. All of the New Testament passages concerning alms and almsgiving, except one in Matthew, are in Luke-Acts. Therefore, these parables may be about alms, almsgiving and the proper use of the wealth controlled by the temple authorities. Luke's criticism focuses on the use of these temple resources by the religious aristocracy for their own selfish purposes. This means that the religious authorities controlled tremendous wealth that had been in times past properly distributed to the people as part of the institutional form of almsgiving. The priests in these parables are unfaithful, dishonest and disobedient because, inter alia, they have not invited the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind to the banquet table. Once the office of the High Priest became non-hereditary, and available to the highest bidder, the institutional role of almsgiving was abandoned or reduced as the purchaser had to recoup his purchase price. A minority view identifies Theophilus as a later high priest: Mattathias ben Theophilus who served from 65 to 66. Note that Luke refers to high priest Joseph ben Caiaphas simply as \\"Caiaphas\\".Luke 3:2. Thus, the reasoning goes, Luke used this pattern when addressing Theophilus.

He is the former chief political commentator of The Daily Telegraph, from which he resigned in early 2015. He is author of The Rise of Political Lying and The Triumph of the Political Class, and, with Frances Weaver, the pamphlet Guilty Men. He writes a political column for Middle East Eye. He sat as a commissioner for the Citizens Commission on Islam, Participation and Public Life. He won the Press Awards Columnist of the Year in 2012 and again in 2016. Biography =Early life and career= Oborne was educated at Sherborne School and read history at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating with a BAA Cambridge BA automatically converts to an MA (Master of Arts) as long as certain conditions are satisfied degree in 1978. After abandoning work on a doctorate, he joined NM Rothschild's corporate finance division in 1981, and stayed there for three years. He began working for Robert Maxwell's now closed Financial Weekly magazine in 1985, being taken on by the editor Mihir Bose. In between two spells on the Evening Standard, the second being more extended, he joined The Daily Telegraph in 1987 for what turned out to be five months. During his second period on the Standard, he was sent to Westminster in 1992 as a junior political journalist by Paul Dacre, then the Standards editor. After moving to the Express titles in 1996, where he was taken on by Sue Douglas as a political commentator, he accepted voluntary redundancy in April 2001 at a time when the titles' new proprietor, Richard Desmond, was attempting to reduce losses. Oborne is the author of a highly critical biography of Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, published in 1999, and a biography of the cricketer Basil D'Oliveira (whose selection for England to tour South Africa in 1968 caused that country's apartheid regime to cancel the tour). Oborne is also a vocal critic of the late Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, and author of a pamphlet, published by the Centre for Policy Studies about the situation in Zimbabwe, A moral duty to act there. =From 2003 to 2006= As a television journalist, Oborne made three polemical documentaries with filmmaker Paul Yule: \\"Mugabe's Secret Famine\\" (2003), \\"Afghanistan ‚Äì Here's One We Invaded Earlier\\" (2004), and \\"Not Cricket ‚Äì The Basil D'Oliveira Conspiracy\\" (2004). When the paperback of Oborne's book on the D'Oliveira affair, Basil D'Oliveira, Cricket and Conspiracy: The Untold Story was published in 2005, Owen Slot wrote in a review in The Times, that Oborne \\"sets it up beautifully: one gentle, conservative Cape Town coloured man versus apartheid at its most rabid, the odds stacked heavily against the former\\". Robin Marlar in The Sunday Times thought \\"the positives in this book have it by a mile, the good guys are praised, and the others revealed\\". The book was written with D'Oliveira's involvement. In an edition of the Channel 4 Dispatches programme in November 2004, \\"The Dirty Race for the White House\\", broadcast just before the re- election of George W. Bush, Oborne asserted: \\"This US presidential election is about using the darkest tools of political persuasion ‚Äî fear, lies and black propaganda ‚Äî in order to target an amazingly small but utterly decisive group of largely ignorant voters\\". The historian Andrew Roberts wrote in The Times that such claims by Oborne as the country's voters being \\"ignorant beyond belief\\" was a \\"staggeringly snobbish, anti-American generalisation\\" and that \\"it can hardly be blamed on the candidates that they engage the electorate in the vernacular in which they are best likely to be understood\\". In April 2005, he presented the Channel 4 programme in the Election Unspun series, Why Politicians Can't Tell the Truth, that examined how major political parties in Britain allegedly pursue an agenda designed to appeal only to a narrow band of floating voters expected to play a decisive role in the UK general elections of 2005. In a Dispatches broadcast in November 2005, \\"Iraq ‚Äî The Reckoning\\", he commented that the 2003 invasion was \\"the greatest foreign policy disaster since Munich. And our Government has reacted in precisely the same way: by going into denial. Denial about the role our troops are really playing in Iraq. Denial about the true nature of the emerging Iraqi state. Above all, we‚Äôre in denial about the fact that the invasion of Iraq, as conceived by President Bush and Tony Blair, has failed\\". =From 2006 to 2009= In April 2006, it was announced that Oborne was taking up a new position at the Daily Mail as a political columnist, while retaining his connection with The Spectator as a contributing editor. He had been The Spectators political editor since 2001. Fraser Nelson of The Scotsman replaced Oborne as The Spectators political editor. Oborne's book The Triumph of the Political Class was published in 2007. Simon Jenkins, in a review for The Sunday Times, summarised Oborne's thesis \\"in his latest diatribe against Britain's ing√©nue ruling class\\" as \\"Out have gone mandarins, independent advisers, political parties and ministers with experience of life. In has come a tight network of loyalist apparatchiks, quango-crats, lobbyists and City consultants\\" in the era of New Labour. Jenkins observed: \\"Amid all this sound and fury, it is sometimes hard to discern Oborne's real complaint from his aloof moralism. Much of what he attacks predates Blair\\". Oborne wrote some years later: \\"Blair falls into the tradition of [Robert] Walpole and [David] Lloyd George\\", who greatly enriched themselves in office, although Blair's \\"exploitation of the office of prime minister came after he left Downing Street\\". In July 2008, Oborne presented another Dispatches programme made for Channel 4 called It Shouldn't Happen to a Muslim. In this film and the accompanying leaflet Muslims Under Siege co-written with television journalist James Jones, it was argued that the demonisation of Muslims has become widespread in British media and politics. The pamphlet was serialised in The Independent. In an October 2006 Guardian interview with James Silver, Oborne was against the \\"litany of condemnation\\" of Muslim women who wear the veil from government ministers and considered it an \\"anti-Islamic crusade\\". In his opinion, New Labour had \\"given up on the Muslim vote after the Iraq war, so it's now bashing Muslims to get back the white working-class vote and the veil row is a very carefully orchestrated political strategy\\". Oborne was on the Orwell Prize's Journalism shortlist for 2009. =From 2009 to 2015= Israel, the EU and other issues In collaboration with James Jones, Oborne wrote the pamphlet \\"The Pro-Israel Lobby In Britain\\",Oborne, Peter; Jones, James. \\"The pro-Israel lobby in Britain: full text\\", openDemocracy (13 November 2009). Accessed 24 January 2016 which outlined the influence enjoyed by pro-Israeli media and political lobbyists in the United Kingdom. The article asserted that while the lobbying efforts of groups such as Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), Labour Friends of Israel, and the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre (BICOM) are legal, their funding is often untraceable, their operations are not transparent, and media seldom declare the influence of junkets arranged by these pro-Israeli entities on the tenor of their writing. Oborne and Jones conclude that changes are needed \\"because politics in a democracy should never take place behind closed doors. It should be out in the open and there for all to see.\\" On the same issue. Oborne wrote and presented an edition of Dispatches titled \\"Inside Britain's Israel Lobby\\", featuring interviews with people mentioned in the pamphlet and commenting on the BBC's refusal to broadcast the 2009 DEC Gaza appeal. In December 2012, he argued that the Conservatives' unwillingness to criticise the Israeli government threatens the prospect of a permanent peace in the region. In collaboration with Conservative Member of Parliament Jesse Norman, Oborne produced the pamphlet Churchill's Legacy ‚Äì the Conservative case for the Human Rights Act in the summer of 2009. Published by Liberty, the pamphlet attempted to show how \\"the Act is not a charter for socialism but contains the most basic rights from 900 years of British history\\". In September 2011, Oborne and Frances Weaver co-authored the pamphlet \\"Guilty Men\\" for the Centre for Policy Studies written, according to Denis MacShane in The Guardian, with Oborne's \\"characteristic rococo exuberance\\". The text is freely available, see According to Oborne and Weaver in a covering article \\"the pro-Europeans find themselves in the same situation as appeasers in 1940, or communists after the fall of the Berlin Wall\\". The report sought to identify the politicians, institutions and commentators who the authors felt had tried to take Britain into the European Single Currency. The Financial Times, which \\"has been wrong on every single major economic judgment over the past quarter century\\", in the covering article is accused of a \\"vendetta\\" against Euro-sceptics. In the report, the FT, BBC and CBI are accused of being \\"villains\\" and considered the \\"propaganda arm for the pro-single currency movement\\".Guilty Men (2011), pp. 8‚Äì9 MacShane wrote that the authors' made false claims in the report against the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and he dismisses the idea that the British media \\"have been suborned into aiding and abetting a pro-Europe line\\" because the press is dominated by a right-wing euro-sceptic agenda. Following the pamphlet's publication, Oborne made frank comments on the BBC programme Newsnight on 28 September 2011. In the debate about the Greek debt crisis and its effects on the eurozone, he referred to the European Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj Tardio as \\"that idiot in Brussels\\" which, after he used the phrase for a third time, resulted in Tardio walking out of the studio. (Tardio, spokesman for European Union economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn, was speaking from a studio in Brussels.) Oborne was mocked by Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman for \\"gratuituous rudeness\\" after Paxman had himself asked for a response from, \\"Mr Idiot in Brussels\\". On 10 May 2012, on the BBC's Question Time programme, Oborne commented following the jailing of a Rochdale sex trafficking gang, who had been convicted of rape, sexual activity with children and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children having raped, physically assaulted and sexually groomed girls as young as 12. Oborne said the victims had \\"accepted the advances\\" of their attackers and added: \\"What does it tell us about what's happened to our society that we have 12 year old girls, 13 year old girls, who are happy to give up their affection and their beauty to men in exchange for a packet of crisps?\\"BBC Question Time, 10 May 2012. Some, such as Vicky Allan of The Herald, have claimed that this type of rhetoric amounts to victim blaming, saying that: \\"there is a prevalent conviction that young girls are somehow asking for whatever they get as soon as they begin to behave in a sexual manner, or choose to involve themselves with men\\". Oborne has been critical of the state of Saudi Arabia - United Kingdom relations as he considers that Saudi Arabia has too much influence over British politicians' decisions due to the value of arms they buy from British-headquartered companies like BAE Systems. In October 2014, his Daily Telegraph column criticised the British government for launching an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood, apparently on the say-so of the Saudi Arabian government and the Arab lobby. On the Arab lobby, he said: \\"Unlike the Pro-Israel lobby (with which it is, nevertheless, very closely allied) there are few obvious institutional structures or pressure points. The British Arab lobby is inchoate. It is powerfully represented at the heart of the British military and intelligence establishments, while its connections with the oil and defence industries remain profound. Relations with the British monarchy run very deep.\\" He also called on the British government to end its support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Book about Iran Written with David Morrison, Oborne's book A Dangerous Delusion: Why the Iranian Nuclear Threat is a Myth (2013) sought to dispel what the authors see as a common misconception of a malign intent behind Iran's nuclear power programme, and objects to the current sanctions against Iran and argues against any military intervention. The Times leader writer Oliver Kamm disagreed with the author's notion that Ayatollah Khomeini was \\"one of the greatest theologians of all time\\" whose \\"teaching contained insights which went far deeper than anything the rationalists and materialists of the United States could imagine\\" suggesting those insights fall somewhat short of the proposals of Thomas Jefferson in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Kamm's reference is to Of a podcast involving the authors, Douglas Murray asserted that Morrison, with the acquiescence of Oborne, made disingenuous claims about President Ahmadinejad's history of Holocaust denial. Oborne, responding to his critics in an article for The Spectators 'Coffee House' blog, complained of the \\"scale and (in some cases) virulence that I have never encountered before\\" of his and Morrison's opponents. He rejected Kamm and Murray's claims about his co-author, who \\"fully accepts\\" the veracity of claims against Ahmadinejad. Oborne wrote that \\"not one of our critics have even tried to deal with the central, factual points of our short book: that Iran isn‚Äôt in possession of nuclear weapons and isn‚Äôt building them\\". Michael Axworthy thought that \\"For the most part, Oborne and Morrison are right and their arguments are strong.\\", but Douglas Murray, after quoting Oborne's comment in a response, wrote that \\"customers should ask for a refund\\". A review by Con Coughlin for The Jewish Chronicle speculated that Oborne's \\"unhappy descent into the world of international fantasy\\" owed much to his association with Morrison, and accused \\"the authors\\" of \\"alarming ignorance about the rudimentary principles that underpin the current Iranian regime\\" and reports from intelligence sources and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Resignation from The Daily Telegraph Oborne had re- joined The Daily Telegraph in May 2010 from the Mail to write for the newspaper from the following September. On 17 February 2015, Oborne resigned from The Daily Telegraph. In a letter posted to the online news website, openDemocracy, Oborne criticised his former employer for the allegedly unscrupulous relationship between their editorial and commercial arms. Specifically, Oborne outlined how the paper would suppress negative stories and drop investigations into the HSBC bank, a major source of their advertising revenue, which, in his opinion, compromised their journalistic integrity calling it a \\"form of fraud on its readers\\". He also alleged that The Telegraphs coverage of stories relating to UK supermarket chain Tesco, shipping company Cunard and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong had been influenced by commercial considerations. He added, \\"There are other very troubling cases, many of them set out in Private Eye, which has been a major source of information for Telegraph journalists wanting to understand what is happening on their paper\\". The Telegraph group responded to Oborne's claims in a statement: \\"We aim to provide all our commercial partners with a range of advertising solutions, but the distinction between advertising and our award- winning editorial operation has always been fundamental to our business. We utterly refute [sic] any allegation to the contrary.\\" Michael White wrote of Oborne at the time: \\"What makes him unusual, however, not just among journalists, is his powerful sense of right and wrong\\". =Career from 2015= In July 2015, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a report by Oborne in which he and producer Anna Meisel investigated the closure a year earlier of HSBC bank accounts belonging to British Muslim institutions and individuals. He had originally begun his investigation whilst working for The Daily Telegraph but the newspaper had refused to publish the resultant article, which had been critical of the bank's decision, triggering his decision to resign. On 30 June 2015, it was announced that Oborne would rejoin the Daily Mail with a weekly political column starting in the autumn and write a weekly column in Middle East Eye. During the nomination process for the 2016 United States presidential election, Oborne said that while Hillary Clinton \\"for me is a warmonger\\" as \\"[t]here's never been a war she hasn't supported\\", the eventual US President, Donald Trump \\"in terms of his foreign policy is actually quite sensible. He doesn't want to get involved\\". The Russian government, in his opinion, under Vladimir Putin is among the countries in the world which have \\"been converted into a form of pillage by a ruling family, individual or ruling elite\\". Though previously a \\"strong Brexiter\\", on 7 April 2019, Oborne wrote an article for the UK-based political website openDemocracy suggesting that the Brexit decision needs to be rethought: > \\"So I argue, as a Brexiteer, that we need to take a long deep breath. We > need to swallow our pride, and think again. Maybe it means rethinking the > Brexit decision altogether.\\" In October 2019, Oborne wrote a piece in the OpenDemocracy about how journalists and the media are being used by Downing Street to get their false news out, saying \\"It‚Äôs chilling. From the Mail, The Times to the BBC and ITN, everyone is peddling Downing Street‚Äôs lies and smears. They‚Äôre turning their readers into dupes.\\" In an interview with Channel 4 News, he said the journalists, who are being used by the government include the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg and ITV's Robert Peston. Personal life Oborne describes himself as a \\"regular Anglican churchgoer\\", and his wife, Martine, is Vicar at St Michael's Sutton Court in Chiswick, west London. The couple have five children. Martine Oborne is also a writer and illustrator.

He was the only rider to score qualified rides from the 1987 World Champion and 1990 ProRodeo Hall of Fame bull Red Rock. He died in the arena at the 1989 Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo as a result of injuries sustained when the bull Takin' Care of Business struck him after the ride.\\"Bull rider dies after being gored\\", Tulsa World, July 31, 1989. Early life At the time of Lane's birth, his parents lived in Lapoint, Utah. His father, Clyde, was on the rodeo circuit as a saddle bronc and bareback rider. His mother, Elsie, went to stay with her parents in Kim, Colorado, and he was born in the hospital in La Junta. He had an older sister, Robin, and a younger brother, Cody. Frost started riding dairy calves around age 5-6\\\\. His first rodeo awards were won when he was 10, at the \\"Little Buckaroos\\" Rodeos held in Uintah Basin: first in bareback, second in calf roping, and third in the \\"bull riding\\" (calf riding) event. He also competed in wrestling in junior high school. The family then moved to Oklahoma and he attended Atoka High School in Atoka. In Oklahoma, he was the National High School Bull Riding Champion in 1981. He was the Bull Riding Champion of the first Youth National Finals in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1982. On January 5, 1985, Frost married Kellie Kyle (born 1965), a barrel racer from Quanah, Texas, west of Wichita Falls. Professional career Frost joined the PRCA and began rodeoing full-time after graduating from high school in 1982. In 1987, he became the PRCA World Champion Bull Rider at age 24. That same year, the bull Red Rock, owned by Growney Bros. Rodeo Company, was voted Bucking Bull of the Year. In 309 attempts, no one had ever ridden him, and in 1988, at the Challenge of the Champions, Frost rode him in seven exhibition matches and was successful in four out of seven tries. He went on to compete at the Rodeo '88 Challenge Cup held as part of the Cultural Olympiad in association with the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Challenge of the Champions Sometime in 1988, John Growney pondered a special competition between the two 1987 Champions. It was decided that Frost and Red Rock would have seven showdowns at different rodeos in states across the West. The event was titled the \\"Challenge of the Champions.\\" Red Rock was brought out of retirement and Frost finally rode him to the eight-second whistle for a scoring ride for 4 of the 7 matches. Death On July 30, 1989, at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo in Cheyenne, Wyoming, after completing a successful 85-point ride on a Brahma bull named Takin' Care of Business, Frost dismounted and landed in the dirt. The bull turned and hit him in the back with his horn (although he was not gored), breaking several of his ribs. He initially rose to his feet, waving at Tuff Hedeman for help. As he took a couple of steps, he fell to the ground, causing his heart and lungs to be punctured by the broken ribs. He was rushed to Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead. He was 25 years old. No autopsy was performed. He posthumously finished third in the event. Takin' Care of Business appeared in the 1990 National Finals Rodeo. He was retired in the 1990s, and put out to stud until he died in 1999. Frost is buried near his hero and mentor, Freckles Brown, in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Hugo, Oklahoma.\\"Cowboy's funeral draws throng\\", AP in Tulsa World, August 3, 1989. Legacy After Frost's death, Cody Lambert, who currently resides in Bowie, Texas, one of his traveling partners, and a founder of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR), created the protective vest that all professional cowboys now must wear when riding bulls. In 1994, the biopic based on Frost's life, 8 Seconds, was released. Luke Perry played the role of Frost. Stephen Baldwin was cast as Tuff Hedeman. The medical team for the PBR league is named after Frost, as is the Lane Frost/Brent Thurman Award, given for the highest scoring ride at the PBR World Finals. The Lane Frost Health and Rehabilitation Center in Hugo is dedicated to his memory. Country music star Garth Brooks paid tribute to Frost in the video for his 1990 hit single \\"The Dance\\". Rodeo announcer Randy Schmutz wrote the song \\"A Smile Like That\\" about him.Jane and Michael Stern, \\"Raging Bulls\\", The New Yorker, September 14, 1992, p. 93 . The 1993 song \\"Red Rock\\" by the Smokin' Armadillos is about him, and he is mentioned at the end of the video for Korn's 2007 song \\"Hold On\\". Aaron Watson's 2012 album, Real Good Time, included the single \\"July in Cheyenne\\".Chuck Dauphin, \\"Aaron Watson Finds Inspiration in Tragic Rodeo Star Lane Frost\\", Billboard, November 18, 2013. Kings of Leon 2013 music video for Beautiful War pays homage to Lane Frost. In August 1990, Frost was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 1999, he was named to the PBR Heroes & Legends Celebration: Ring of Honor, the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame, the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame in Fort Worth. In 2017, he was inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame. Frost's parents have authorized Cowboy Bible: The Living New Testament, with a sketch of him on the cover. A documentary titled \\"The Challenge of the Champions: The Story of Lane Frost and Red Rock\\" premiered in 2008. It covers the match between them. In 2014, on the 25th anniversary of Frost's death, the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle published as part of its coverage of Cheyenne Frontier Days an article recalling the highlights of his career and his character. His friend, Cody Lambert, is quoted: \\"I'm a John Wayne fan, and I don't mean any disrespect to John Wayne, but he played the characters that Lane really was.\\" Sage Kimzey, the champion bull rider from Strong City, Oklahoma, said: \\"He's the guy every young bull rider wants to grow up and be like.\\" Tuff Hedeman compared Frost's death to that of James Dean: \\"gone way too soon.\\" After surviving an accident on the last lap of the 2015 Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway, NASCAR Cup Series driver Austin Dillon waved to the crowd with a similar gesture to that of Frost‚Äôs; he later stated that it was purposefully in tribute to Frost.

He was the son of David Grauman (who died in 1921 in Los Angeles, California) and Rosa Goldsmith (1853‚Äì1936). Grauman's parents were theatrical performers on various show circuits. Biography =Early years= Born to Jewish parents, Grauman and his father went to Dawson City, Yukon, for the Gold Rush when he was a young man. He worked there as a paperboy. Since newspapers were scarce, they could command a dollar each. Grauman told a story about a store owner who purchased a newspaper from him for $50. The shopkeeper then read the paper aloud in his store, charging admission to local miners. In the Yukon, the young Grauman learned a lesson which would serve him the rest of his life: that people would willingly pay handsomely for entertainment. Sid and his father began organizing events like boxing matches, which paid them well. It was also in the Yukon that Grauman saw his first motion picture. A failed prospector in the Klondike gold rush, David Grauman initially took his young son to the Klondike with the idea of building a theater there. Though they did not strike gold, both of the Graumans were made considerably wealthy by their Klondike entertainment activities. When his father's sister became ill and he left the territory to care for her, young Grauman remained in Dawson City for a time. His parents settled in San Francisco and Grauman joined them there in 1900. =San Francisco= Sid Grauman's imprint David and his son decided to open a vaudeville theater in San Francisco. Their first venture was on Market Street near Mason called the Unique Theater. Before long they added motion pictures to the vaudeville shows, and another theater called the Lyceum. As the theater manager, though Sid Grauman had seen just about every type of performance, there were some that startled and amazed him, turning down an offer to learn how to swallow swords. The Graumans were also instrumental in establishing the Northwest Vaudeville Company, which stretched from San Francisco to Minneapolis and Portland, Oregon. The association brought quality live entertainment at reasonable prices to the Northwest area of the US. David Grauman tried his hand at expanding his theater business in New York City and the East Coast, where he was far from successful; for a time, Sid worked in Scranton, Pennsylvania at one of the theaters he and his father were interested in. David Grauman suffered enough financial loss to have the need to take a business partner in his Lyceum Theater, and to accept an offer from the partner to buy him out in 1905. He later arranged to take over the lease of the Lyceum, which would then evict his former partner from the theater in 1907. By early 1906, the Graumans had lost their lease of the Unique Theater. The building had been purchased by the president of the Orpheum Theater circuit and Grauman's rent was doubled by the new owner. The structure was able to house a theater only because Grauman had established one there before a fire ordinance prohibiting it was passed. Before his tenancy was over, Grauman hired a crew of men with axes to demolish the interior of the Unique, so it could not be re-built for use as a theater. Sid Grauman with Red Skelton at Skelton's imprint ceremony in 1942 With the Unique Theater gone and the Lyceum unable to be occupied by the Graumans until 1907, father and son appeared to be temporarily out of business when the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 destroyed both the Unique and Lyceum theaters. Sid was able to save one of the theater's movie projectors from the ruins. He was also able to get a tent from an evangelist preacher in Oakland. Putting those together with some pews from a destroyed church, he set up on the site where the Unique once stood. The Graumans posted a sign outside of their makeshift theater that said: \\"Nothing to fall on you but canvas if there is another quake.\\" The family received a commendation from the City of San Francisco for their help in boosting citizens' morale during the trying times. They operated their tent theater for two years; by that time David Grauman had opened a theater called the New National Theater. The Graumans expanded their theaters within a short period of time, opening the Imperial and the Empress in San Francisco, and branching out further to other Northern California cities. By 1917, the Graumans decided they would relocate to Los Angeles and build theaters there. They approached Adolph Zukor, who would go on to be the owner and founder of Paramount Pictures, regarding a business deal. Zukor agreed to buy the San Francisco theaters off the Graumans and also to assist them with financing in beginning their theater business in Los Angeles. =San Jose= Sid Grauman introduced the flickers to San Jose, California. On February 7, 1903, Sid Grauman opened the Unique Theatre at 20 East Santa Clara Street in San Jose. The theatre presented movies, stock theater companies, amateur nights, and vaudeville acts. The most notable amateur to develop his talent there was Roscoe ‚ÄúFatty‚Äù Arbuckle. The 1906 earthquake demolished the Unique Theatre, and Grauman moved on to Los Angeles, founding the Princess Theatre and Grauman‚Äôs Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. =Los Angeles= By 1918, the first of the three noteworthy Los Angeles movie palaces was open for business: the Million Dollar Theatre. \\"D.J. Grauman and Sid Grauman tonight join the ranks of Los Angeles' theatrical magnates in the formal opening of their new million dollar theater at Third and Broadway.\\" (pay-per-view) In 1921, David Grauman died suddenly, never able to see the completion of the Egyptian Theatre which opened the year after his death.\\"D.J. Grauman, veteran theatrical man and motion-picture exhibitor of California and vice-president of the Grauman Theatrical Enterprises, died late yesterday afternoon at his home, 6622 St. Frances Court, Hollywood. Death came after an illness of less than two days, presumably from heart failure brought about by a cold.\\" (pay-per-view) Now working on his own, Sid Grauman began the building of his last theater, the Chinese Theatre in 1926. It was opened for a premiere on May 18, 1927. There was a crush of onlookers eager to have a glimpse of both the stars attending and the splendor of the building. Many of the fittings were imported from China and Chinese artisans were brought in to create works of sculpture which were originally located in the theater's forecourt and are now housed inside the theater. The forecourt still contains the now-famous celebrity hand and footprints in cement. The tradition began by accident, while the finishing touches were being put on the Chinese Theatre. Two versions of the story have been published; one has Mary Pickford as the actress who stepped in the wet cement on her way to see Sid Grauman's new building, and the other credits Norma Talmadge with the misstep. Grauman decided it was a wonderful way to have a permanent record of the stars, and began inviting selected film personalities to put their hand and footprints in concrete. Grauman himself made the choices; the tradition continued after his death using a secret system for choosing celebrities. Grauman was not the sole owner of the Chinese Theatre, even though it bears his name. His business partners in the venture were Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and Howard Schenck. Two years after its opening, he sold his share of the theater to Fox West Coast Theatres, but remained its Managing Director for the rest of his life. Over four million people visit the Chinese Theatre yearly. In addition to his theater, and Hollywood energies, Sid Grauman built the Hollywood Roller Bowl which caused for the 'discovery' of Gloria Nord, who would become one of the most important people in roller skating's history.Gloria Nord Grauman's non-entertainment ventures turned out as badly as his father's. He formed the Black Hills Exploration Corporation in a gold mining effort near Deadwood, South Dakota. Grauman had convinced others such as entertainer Al Jolson and many movie company executives to join him in investing in the company. The company was not successful and Grauman advised everyone to get out of the investment. Grauman was known far and wide among Hollywood's leading stars and was considered to be a close friend to many, including Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle. It was in Grauman's office at the Million Dollar Theatre that Arbuckle called the San Francisco police to turn himself in. Arbuckle began working for Grauman as a singer at his San Francisco Unique Theater as R. C. Arbuckle. The San Francisco theater connections of father and son meant the Graumans knew people like Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, as the stars had performed at one of the Grauman theaters when they were on their way up. David Grauman was the originator of Pickford's \\"America's Sweetheart\\" nickname. Grauman, who never married, was devoted to his mother. She was the only non-celebrity whose imprints were taken for display; after Rosa's death, Grauman kept all of her personal effects. Grauman was very closely connected with the motion picture industry and appeared in several cameo appearances that nodded to his fame in Hollywood and further afield in the Gold Rush. Living for 35 years at Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel, Grauman spent the last six months of his life at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, but not because of illness. Grauman liked being at Cedars and would leave to eat at various premier restaurants and return to the hospital to sleep. Death and legacy Grauman received an honorary Academy Award in 1949 for raising the standard for film exhibition. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6379 Hollywood Blvd. He was one of the original 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). Grauman died of a coronary occlusion at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on March 5, 1950, twelve days shy of his 71st birthday. He was interred in the Sanctuary of Benediction alcove in the Memorial Terrace section of the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. After Grauman's death, a woman named Carrie Adair came forward with claims of being his common-law wife and the mother of his child. Adair produced a copy of a will and a letter naming her as Grauman's childhood sweetheart. Adair's sister, Agnes Gerlich, gave testimony that her sister was living in Texas during the time she was said to be with Grauman. She also stated that the child Adair referred to was actually her daughter and not Adair's. See also *Charles E.

McVitie's biscuit factory is one of the main employers in the area today, with a facility in the area since the 1920s.Tollcross, Gazetteer for ScotlandGlasgow, 35 Clydeford Drive, Macfarlane Lang & Co Biscuit Factory, Canmore Many residents of the Lilybank housing estate would consider themselves residents of Tollcross, but they, like the biscuit factory, were officially placed within the separate Braidfauld Ward of Glasgow City Council until its reorganisation in 2007; since then, Maukinfauld Road has been the local administrative boundary, with land to the west in the Calton ward and land to the east in Shettleston ward along with the rest of Tollcross. Tollcross Road Part of the Tollcross area was formerly known as Egypt, and is still marked so on a number of maps; the name is believed to have been derived from a farm that existed at one time in the vicinity, operated by a former soldier who had been stationed in Egypt.Egypt Farm (Burrell Collection Photo Library, 1950s), The Glasgow Story The farm, owned by the Gordon family in 1920s before being sold to the Hamilton family.Egypt Farm (Burrell Collection Photo Library, 1940s), The Glasgow Story The poet William Miller, author of \\"Wee Willie Winkie\\", is buried in Tollcross. In June 2011, pupils from St. Aidan's and St. Joan of Arc School combined into a new school located on Fullarton Avenue. They voted to call the new school Cardinal Winning, after Thomas Winning, the late Archbishop of Glasgow who died in 2001; the new school opened on 21 June 2011. Just south of the school is Fullarton Park, home to the local Junior level football club Vale of Clyde, and the Tollcross Bowling Club adjacent to a modern retail park on London Road.

The clan has no chief; it is therefore considered an armigerous clan. Surname The surname Macrae (and its variations) is an anglicisation of the patronymic from the Gaelic personal name MacRaith. This personal name means \\"son of grace\\". The name is recorded numerous times in the Middle Ages, and was used by various unrelated families.Black, Surnames of Scotland, p.560. Traditional origins of the clan According to the late 19th-century historian Alexander Mackenzie, and Rev. Alexander Macrae in the early 20th century, the main authority for the early history of Clan Macrae is the late 17th-century manuscript account of the clan written by Rev. John Macrae. Alexander Macrae largely based his history of the clan upon John Macrae's earlier account. According to tradition, the Macraes were originally from Ireland and shared a common ancestry with the Mackenzies and Macleans. The Macraes were said to have originated from Clunes, which is located near the southern shore of the Beauly Firth, and was within the lordship of Lovat. Alexander Macrae stated that these traditions likely refer to a period sometime in the middle of the 13th century. According to John Macrae, after a violent dispute arose between the Macraes and more powerful Frasers of Lovat, three sons of the Macrae chief set off for new lands. One of the sons settled in Brahan, near Dingwall (later the site of Brahan Castle); another settled in Argyll; and the other settled in Kintail. romanticised Victorian-era illustration of a Macrae clansman by R. R. McIan from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands published in 1845 At that time Kintail was held by the Mackenzies, and according to John Macrae's account, there were very few Mackenzies of the chiefly line and thus the chief of that clan welcomed the Macraes because they shared a common descent and could be relied upon. Although John Macrae did not know the name of the Macrae brother who settled in Kintail, he stated that this Macrae brother married the daughter, or granddaughter, of Macbeolan who possessed a large part of Kintail before Mackenzie's rise to power. Alexander Mackenzie considered this marriage to be the real reason for the loyalty given by the Macraes to their Mackenzie lords; he did not believe the Macraes and Mackenzies to share a common ancestry in the male line as John Macrae had claimed. Eilean Donan Castle, in 2002 Alexander Macrae was of the opinion that these events probably took place sometime in the first half of the 14th century before the Mackenzies became firmly established in the Kintail area. He stated that there didn't appear to be any evidence that the Macraes were in the Kintail area before the time of these events, but noted that it was said that Eilean Donan Castle was garrisoned by Macraes and Maclennans in the late 13th century, during the period when the fortress was first taken into possession by Kenneth, founder of the Mackenzies of Kintail. According to tradition, one of the prominent ancestors of the Macraes from Kintail was Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd, According to John Macrae, Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd was about two, or three, generations removed from the Macrae who settled in Kintail from Clunes. Alexander Macrae stated that Fionnla Dubh was a contemporary of Murdo Mackenzie, fifth chief of the Mackenzies of Kintail. In 1416, Murdo died and was succeeded by his son, Alexander. According to the traditions of John Macrae, when the bastard uncles of the young Mackenzie chief began oppressing the folk of the district, Fionnla Dubh was instrumental in retrieving him from the south of Scotland; upon Alexander's return, the Mackenzie lands were brought back under control. The main line of the Macraes from Kintail, the Macraes of Inverinate, trace their descent from Fionnla Dubh. History Clachan Duich Highland Church in ruins and burial ground of Clan Macrae Great War Highlands Monument Clan Macrae Sg√πrr Fhuaran seen from Sg√πrr na Ciste Dhuibhe The Macraes are known to have been constant supporters of the Clan Mackenzie in recorded times; in 1520, and for many years onwards, they were constables of Eilean Donan Castle. In 1539 the Clan Macdonald of Sleat besieged Eilean Donan as part of their attempt to restore the Lordship of the Isles and Duncan Macrae is credited with slaying the Macdonald chief with an arrow which brought the siege to an end.Way, George and Squire, Romilly. Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Page 426‚Äì427. In view of their constant service to the Mackenzies, the Macraes of Kintail became known as the Mackenzies' \\"shirt of mail\\". =17th century and civil war= The Rev. Farquhar Macrae, born in 1580, Constable of Eilean Donan, was both an energetic churchman and a great Latin scholar. On his first visit to the Isle of Lewis, he is said to have baptised all the inhabitants under forty years of age, no clergyman having resided on the island during that period. His second son, John Macrae, became minister of Dingwall in 1640 and died in 1704. During the Civil War the Clan Macrae supported the Royalist cause but under the equivocating Earl of Seaforth firstly fought valiantly on the losing Stateside at the Battle of Auldearn in May 1645 before following Seaforth to support the royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Rev. Farquhar Macrae's grandson, Duncan Macrae of Inverinate was the compiler of the famous Fernaig manuscript 1688-93.MacPharlain, Calum Lamh-Sgr√¨obhainn Mhic Rath, (Dundee) =18th century and Jacobite risings= The Jacobite rising of 1715 was a disastrous event for the Macraes. The crucial battle was the Battle of Sheriffmuir, near Stirling. The Macraes formed the left flank and were left unprotected when the Jacobite cavalry was moved by error across to the right. The Highland foot (Macraes) was charged by the Government cavalry, fell back and rallied again and again up to twelve times. Of the 232 Jacobite casualties suffered in the battle 58 of those killed were Macraes. Among those killed was Duncan MacRae, who as a young man was known for both his superior strength and his tender heart. During the battle, he killed at least seven men with his Claymore before he was shot down by an English trooper. His claymore was exhibited for many years in the Tower of London as \\"The great Highlander's sword\\". Another Macrae killed at Sheriffmuir was John of Conchra, who was distinguished in battle and esteemed in the Highlands, he was one of the \\"Four Johns of Scotland\\". In 1721 a force of men from the Clan Ross, led by chief William Ross 6th of the Pitcalnie line and his brother Robert went on a rent- collecting expedition into the lands of the Mackenzies. They were confronted by a force of 300 men from the Clan Mackenzie and Clan Macrae, led by a Colonel Donald Murchison. The Rosses were outnumbered and after a short battle, the two sides parleyed and the Rosses withdrew realising that further resistance was useless. The next day the chief's son Walter Ross died of his wounds and his nephew William, son of Robert Ross, was wounded but survived. See main article: Battle of Glen Affric. The Macraes were split in regards to supporting the Jacobite cause in the Jacobite rising of 1745. A number of Macraes are known to have taken the side of the British government as part of the Independent Companies under Captain Colin Mackenzie. While others would side with the Jacobites under George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie. It is recorded that the Mackenzie Company was at Shiramore in Badenoch in June 1746 and it included over sixty Macraes. It is recorded that John MacRae was an Ensign in one of the Mackenzie Independent Highland Companies that supported the British Government and that was commanded by the aforementioned Captain Colin Mackenzie.Simpson, Peter. (1996). The Independent Highland Companies, 1603‚Äì1760. . pp. 127 ‚Äì 128 and 130. Eilean Donan Castle Eilean Donan Castle is located where three lochs meet, Loch Duich, Loch Long and Loch Alsh. It has long been associated with the Macraes, when it was a stronghold of the chiefs of Clan Mackenzie. The castle was destroyed by the British Royal Navy in 1719 during the third of the Jacobite risings. The ruined castle was purchased and rebuilt during 1912‚Äì1932, by Lt.-Col. John MacRae-Gilstrap. Its beauty, and spectacular setting, has made it the most photographed castle in Great Britain, and it draws many visitors every year. Symbols Today, crest badges, clan badges, and clan tartans are all means of identifying clans and displaying members' allegiance to their clan. A crest badge suitable to be worn by a member of Clan Macrae, on a bonnet or upon the chest, contains the crest: A cubit arm grasping a sword, all proper. The motto which circles the crest is: FORTITUDINE, which means \\"with fortitude\\" in Latin.Way; Squire (2000), p. 230. The more authentic clan badges (sometimes called plant badges) are actually plants, of which springs are worn upon a bonnet or upon the chest as a badge. The clan badge of Clan Macrae is club moss.Adam; Innes of Learney (1970), pp. 541‚Äì543. sometimes referred to as staghorn grass. It may refer to the Mackenzie chiefly arms, due to the Macraes' close association with the Mackenzies. The slogan representing the war cry of the clan Sgurr Uaran refers to a prominent rallying point in the clan's traditional lands, Sg√πrr Fhuaran, a mountain near Loch Duich which is one of the \\"Five Sisters of Kintail\\".

","title":"Germany at the 1992 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"1796797","text":"The Alton line is a railway line in Hampshire and Surrey, England, operated by South Western Railway as a relatively long branch of the South Western Main Line. The branch leaves the main line at Pirbright Junction to the west of Brookwood station, Surrey, then turns to the southwest. The route crosses and recrosses the Surrey / Hampshire border, and serves the towns of Aldershot and Farnham before reaching its present-day terminus at Alton in East Hampshire. The line originally continued west to Winchester; the section between Alton and New Alresford is preserved as the heritage Watercress line. The Alton line was electrified (750 V DC third rail) during the late interwar years by Southern Railway. Aside from regular electric trains, freight trains operated by EWS and steam trains connected to the Mid Hants Watercress Railway (by way of rolling stock supply or special excursion) operate on the line. History The first railway line to Farnham opened in 1849 and was a branch from Guildford via Tongham. The line from Farnham to Alton opened on 28 July 1852. On 2 October 1865 the Alton, Aldershot & Winchester Railway extended the line from Alton to Winchester, with Alton station moving to a new site. On 2 May 1870 the present-day line from Brookwood to Farnham opened. Alton became a junction station on 1 June 1901 when the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway opened, temporarily closed 1917‚Äì1924 as the track was taken up for use in France during the First World War, but reopened after local pressure. Use was light and the line closed in 1933. On 1 June 1903 the Meon Valley Railway opened from Alton to on the south coast. This line closed to passengers in 1955. The section between Alton and Winchester was closed in 1973. The 10 mile stretch from Alton to Alresford was reopened in stages from 1977 to 1985 as the Watercress heritage railway. The route between Alresford and Winchester is unlikely to be reopened, as houses and the M3 motorway have since been built across the route. =Temporary closures= ;August 2006 The line closed briefly in August 2006 between Brookwood and Ash Vale due to a landslip at Foxhills Tunnel, causing most commuter journeys to be diverted via Guildford. ;April 2016 Heavy rainfall destabilised the embankment near Wrecclesham causing closure of the line between 13 April 2016 and 3 May 2016. Network Rail undertook further work to fully stabilise the earthworks. Passenger services The current terminus at , taken in 1982 There are two trains per hour in each direction between Waterloo and Alton (Mondays to Saturdays). On Sundays, the service is hourly until the early afternoon when half-hourly. Peak time trains take between 67 and 71 minutes for the whole journey; off- peak trains take between 75 and 78 minutes for the journey and Sunday services take 79 to 85 minutes. Passenger trains that serve this line during off-peak hours also stop at the following stations (from north to south): * Clapham Junction  During peak hours trains typically do not stop at Clapham Junction; some peak trains also omit calls at Surbiton, West Byfleet or Brookwood. On Sundays, the service also calls at Wimbledon. = Historical timetables = From 1937 to 1967, Alton trains ran fast from Waterloo to Surbiton and then ran all stations to Alton. They formed the front (country) end of an 8-car train that split at Woking with the rear 4 cars running to Portsmouth. The trains ran throughout the day and left Waterloo at 27 and 57 minutes past the hour and took exactly 80 minutes to reach Alton. Additionally, there were trains in the rush hours that ran fast to Woking and then all stations ‚Äì at 16:17, 18:14, and 18:17 (also stopping at Surbiton) to Farnham, and at 16:47, 17:17, 17:47 to Alton taking between 72 and 76 minutes. Trains from Waterloo to Alton from 05:25 to 08:25 left two minutes earlier than the standard departures and called at Wimbledon. All trains took the fast line from Waterloo to Surbiton. The last train in the evening was the 22:57 to Farnham, which ran to Alton on Wednesday and Saturday nights only, arriving at 00:17. On Sundays there was a 23:27 that only ran to Farnham. On weekdays the 17:27 and 19:27 had connections at Bentley to Bordon with a five-minute connection at Bentley and a journey time to Bordon of 15 minutes. The diminutive army town of Bordon had a very regular service on Sunday nights from Bentley. On the up line the pattern was similar, with several departures from Farnham to Waterloo starting at 06:05 and then from Alton at 06:54, then every 30 minutes till 22:54 with three extra rush hour services in the morning. In those days the line from Farnham to Alton was double track. In the 1980s the pattern was somewhat different: the off-peak trains ran half-hourly and stopped at Surbiton, Woking then all stations, being detached from the Bournemouth (hourly) or Basingstoke (hourly) stopping services. Around 1985 Alton lost its half-hourly service, with half the trains terminating at Farnham. Peak services were approximately every 20 minutes until 1985, half- hourly thereafter, generally going fast Waterloo to Woking, occasionally stopping at West Byfleet or Surbiton In 1989 the service changed again with three trains an hour as far as Farnham: a fast train (Clapham Junction, Woking and all stations to Alton), a semi-fast (Surbiton, certain stations to Woking, then all to Farnham) and a slow (Clapham Junction, Wimbledon, Surbiton and all stations to Farnham). Freight services A daily service used to run to Holybourne Oil Terminal from Fawley, but this service has ceased. In order to facilitate the running around of the locomotive on this oil train, the 10:23 service from Waterloo would terminate short at Farnham and not continue to Alton; and as a result there would be no 12:15 return service from Alton to Farnham, this train beginning its journey from Farnham instead at 12:28. This arrangement with the 10:23 Waterloo to Farnham still happens now, even after the suspension of the oil train. Oil carrying wagons are stored in the terminal at Holybourne. Farnham Traincare Depot Farnham Traincare Depot (), in Weydon Lane, was opened by the Southern Railway at the time of the electrification of the Portsmouth and Alton lines in 1937. It was refurbished for the introduction of modern units when slam-door trains were replaced circa 2005. At the same time, disused quarry and ballast dump sidings behind the carriage shed were removed and a number of outdoor sidings were laid for overnight storage and servicing of units. It is between Farnham railway station, Surrey and Bentley (Hampshire) railway station close to the county border. South Western Railway use the depot under the five-to-ten year government franchise operated by the subsidiary. The depot houses mainly Class 450 trains, but also Class 458 and occasionally Class 444 and 456 trains as well.

Background  Turton F.C. is one of the oldest football clubs in the world; records show that Christ Church F.C. (now Bolton Wanderers) were \\"initiated by Turton into the technicalities of the London Association Game\\". Turton played many famous sides including Bolton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers, Everton, Nottingham Forest, Preston North End and Sheffield Wednesday, and many lesser known local teams such as Westhoughton, Astley Bridge and Darwen F.C.. Records show that most of them \\"retired well beaten\\", until the introduction of professionals \\"put the boot on the other leg\\". Many of these teams came to Turton for guidance, learning the newly established rules of the game; as such Turton F.C. played a substantial role in the development of the game as we now know it. Records show Turton hosting matches as far back as 1830, though it was not until August 1874 that members voted \\"that the Rules of the London Football Association be adopted\\".  Professional life  Bentley's first match for Turton F.C. was against Westhoughton in November 1878, at the age of eighteen. Bentley stepped in when Turton were a man down. After \\"showing his paces\\" he became a regular in the team, proving himself to be an excellent half-back. From 1879 onwards he was sending in match reports to local newspapers. He wrote up the Turton matches under the pen name \\"Free Critic\\" and, freely critical of his own performances, contributed regular articles to the Bolton Weekly Journal \\"Cricket and Football Field\\". Bentley was playing for Turton F.C. in September, 1880, when at the invitation of Darwen F.C. the two teams formed the Lancashire County Football Association. Challenges were sent to the Manchester Association, Bolton Wanderers, Cob Wall (Blackburn), Blackburn Rovers, Birch Association, Astley Bridge and Christ Church (Blackburn) Clubs for matches. A number of Turton players figured in County matches, including John James Bentley, his brother Tom Bentley, H. Brown, W. Forrest, J.J. Greenhalgh, J. Hamer, H. Howarth, James Howarth, W.Mather, T. Scowcroft, C. Tootill, P. Toothill, William Trainor, and J. Waddicor. Bentley was first team captain in 1881 when Sheffield Wednesday came to Turton for an FA Cup match, soon becoming first secretary and then treasurer of Turton F.C. In 1882, aged twenty two, he set himself up as an accountant in Acresfield, Bolton. His business thrived, and by 1885 he had given up playing, becoming a collector of income tax and the secretary of Bolton Wanderers. He was described at this time as \\"bold but extravagant, a genius who lived in the future, inspired by a vision of what football could become\\". Between the years 1895 and 1900, John James Bentley was probably the most powerful man English football has ever known. In 1886, he left his Bolton accountant's office to work in Manchester as Assistant Editor, and later Editor, of \\"The Athletic News\\". He became a regular columnist in the Daily Express, Daily Mail and \\"Football chat\\", a weekly magazine. In 1887 William McGregor contacted was John Bentley about the formation of a Football League, because of his influence over Lancashire football. He became a founder committee member of the football league, becoming president on McGregor's retirement in 1894, holding the position until 1910 when he became a life member of the Football League management committee. After leaving Bolton Wanderers, he became the secretary of Manchester United in 1912. Bentley's guidance changed the club from a bankrupt outfit to the power we now know, relocating the team from Clayton to their now world-famous base at Old Trafford. However, he was rather less successful in this role than his predecessor, Ernest Mangnall; he took little interest in the running of the team and largely left the players to their own devices. As a result, the club slumped from being title challengers to barely avoiding relegation, and Bentley handed over to Jack Robson in 1914. He remained involved with Manchester United until retiring from club administration, in 1916, due to ill health. He also became vice-president of the FA. Throughout he maintained contact with Turton FC, and was president of the club in the early years of the 20th Century.  Personal life  John Bentley was born in June 1860 in Chapeltown, a small village to the south of Darwen, between Bolton and Blackburn. His father ran the grocers shop on Chapeltown highstreet, next door to the Chetham arms public house. He was very keen on the new Harrow game when it was introduced to Chapeltown. His older brothers Thomas and William joined in with the first games played under the Harrow rules, but John was too young to play until the Association Rules had been introduced. John married and had three children. John James Bentley died aged fifty eight, and was buried in St Anne's Churchyard, Chapeltown, in September 1918.  Character  In the words of William Pickford, sports writer for the Manchester evening Chronicle: \\"He could be an autocrat but was rarely unpopular because he drew men towards him like a magnet, once persuaded they were forever loyal\\". In the words of William McGregor: \\"In all the years I knew John we never exchanged a wrong word, I was always amazed at his unruffled calm, he made mistakes of course but often because he was too generous, money meant little to him he was a soft touch, especially when it came to former players whose requests he rarely refused, he was a man of real worth blind to the faults of his friends, I can honestly say I have never met a kinder or more easy-going man\\".

It borders the neighborhoods of Maspeth, Middle Village and Glendale, as well as the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bushwick and East Williamsburg. Historically, the neighborhood straddled the Queens-Brooklyn boundary. The etymology of Ridgewood's name is disputed, but it may have referred to Ridgewood Reservoir, the local geography, or a road. The British settled Ridgewood in the 17th century, while the Dutch settled nearby Bushwick. The adjacent settlements led to decades of disputes over the boundary, which later became the border between Queens and Brooklyn. Bushwick was developed rapidly in the 19th century, but Ridgewood remained sparsely populated until the early 20th century, when rowhouses were built for its rapidly growing, predominantly German population. Ridgewood has become more ethnically diverse since the mid-20th century. Large parts of the neighborhood are national and city historic districts. Ridgewood is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 104th Precinct. It is represented by the New York City Council's 30th District.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017.  Etymology  The origin of the neighborhood's name is disputed. One theory is that it came from the Ridgewood Reservoir in Highland Park, in Brooklyn just south of Ridgewood. The reservoir was on a high ridge in the middle of the Harbor Hill Moraine, a terminal moraine that runs the length of Long Island. Another possible etymology is the forests that covered the area before colonial settlement, and that early English settlers called the moraine the \\"ridge\\" of Long Island. Yet another possible etymology is \\"Ridge Road\\". The name was originally applied by the government of Kings County (now coextensive with Brooklyn), and referred to an area within Brooklyn along the border between Kings and Queens Counties. In the early 20th century, developers gave the area various names, including Germania Heights, St. James Park, Ridgewood Heights, Wyckoff Heights, and Knickerbocker Heights, but only \\"Ridgewood\\" gained enough popularity past the 1910s. History = Early settlement = Ridgewood is adjacent to Bushwick, Brooklyn, and the two neighborhoods have similar histories. Both were initially settled by the Lenape Native Americans, specifically the Mespachtes tribe (for whom the adjacent neighborhood of Maspeth is named). In 1638, the Dutch West India Company secured a deed from the Lenape; subsequently, Peter Stuyvesant chartered present-day Bushwick in 1661 under the name Boswijck, meaning \\"neighborhood in the woods\\" in 17th-century Dutch.Block, Stock & Barrel . Block Magazine. Likewise, Ridgewood was part of Newtown, one of the three initial towns in Queens, and was settled by the British. In both neighborhoods, British and Dutch families tilled farms and grew crops for Brooklyn's and Manhattan's markets. Many of these farms also had slaves. The only known remaining Dutch farmhouse in the neighborhood is the Onderdonk House, which was erected in 1709. Also at the Onderdonk House site is Arbitration Rock, a marker for the disputed boundary between Bushwick and Newtown, and by extension Brooklyn and Queens (see ). The land remained rural through the American Revolutionary War, though there may have been a burial ground in the area. Ridgewood's oldest streets are Myrtle Avenue, Metropolitan Avenue, and Fresh Pond Road, which were used by farmers to take their goods to markets. Fresh Pond Road was formerly a Native American trail; the other roads were laid out as plank roads in the early to mid-19th century. = 19th- century development = The development of public transportation, starting with horse-drawn cars in the mid-19th century and later succeeded by trolleys and elevated trains, helped to spur residential and retail development. The first transit line to arrive in the neighborhood was the Myrtle Avenue horsecar, which was extended to Brooklyn's Broadway in 1855. Following this, the Bay Ridge Branch opened in 1878, connecting to Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach, and the Brooklyn shorefront via the Manhattan Beach Railroad. , June 2006 Edition The Myrtle Avenue elevated railroad, running above Myrtle Avenue within Brooklyn, was extended to the Queens border in 1889. An electric trolley line through Ridgewood, running to Lutheran Cemetery, was opened along a private right-of-way in 1894. Ten years later, the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was extended on a ground level alignment over that trolley line. The current elevated structure would be erected along the Lutheran Cemetery line's right- of-way in 1915. Simultaneously, northern Brooklyn was seeing an increase in the number of German immigrants. Many of the city's German immigrants had originally settled in Manhattan's Little Germany, located mostly within the East Village and Lower East Side, in the mid-19th century. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German immigrants had moved to other enclaves such as Yorkville, Manhattan; Steinway, Queens; and the north Brooklyn/Ridgewood area. The discovery of freshwater under northern Brooklyn resulted in the development of breweries, where many Germans worked. By 1880, there were 35 breweries in Brooklyn, including a 14-block \\"brewer's row\\" within Bushwick that contained at least 11 breweries. Factories and knitting mills were also opened within the communities, and speculative German developers built houses, consisting mostly of multi-family stock that were three or four stories tall. \\"Brewer's Row\\" had grown to 14 breweries by 1890. = 20th-century development =  Residential construction  One of the rowhouse developments in Ridgewood, preserved as part of the Stockholm‚ÄìDeKalb‚ÄìHart Historic District Ridgewood remained rural until the unification of New York City's boroughs in 1898, even as Bushwick had become fully developed. Development in Ridgewood in the 19th century consisted mostly of picnicking locations, beer gardens, racetracks, and amusement areas for the residents of Bushwick. By the end of the century, developers had bought these sites and started constructing rowhouses and tenements, usually two to three stories high. The Ridgewood Board of Trade, created in 1902, was organized to develop the streets and utilities, and to improve the transit infrastructure. Much of the housing stock was erected between 1905 and 1915.WPA Guide to New York City: The Federal Writers' Project Guide to 1930s New York. 1939. Most of the houses built before 1905 were wood-frame houses; that year, a zoning ordinance was passed, requiring new buildings to be made of masonry. The area was developed more quickly after the Queensboro Bridge opened in 1909, connecting Queens to Manhattan. According to a 1909 issue of the Real Estate Record and Guide, development was concentrated in an 150-block area around East Williamsburg in Brooklyn, namely the present-day area of Ridgewood. More than five thousand buildings were built from the beginning of the 20th century to World War I's start in the mid-1910s. Residential construction predominated in the southern part of Ridgewood while industrial factories and mills were prevalent in the northern section, near Newtown Creek. Construction slowed down during World War I, but resumed shortly after the war's end, and by the 1930s the last farmland in Ridgewood had been developed. Some of the later houses were single-family homes with garages. Two of the more drastic changes to Ridgewood's character in the 1920s were the implementation of a street numbering system across Queens in 1925, followed by the opening of the Canarsie subway on the neighborhood's southern border in 1928.  Ethnic changes  Ridgewood was among New York City's most quickly-developing neighborhoods between at least 1906 and 1911. Much of the new housing was originally settled by Germans, who had mostly moved from other neighborhoods such as Williamsburg. To the German newcomers, the modern and more expansive houses in Ridgewood provided an improvement over the cramped housing stock in their former neighborhoods. A 1913 Real Estate Record article stated that, for several years, Germans had been moving from Ridgewood from the city's other boroughs. Figures from the 1910 United States Census indicated that much of Ridgewood's population was working-class and of German or Eastern European descent, and many homes were owner-occupied. Ridgewood's German population was so large that the Ridgewood Times first issue in 1908 was published in both English and German. After World War I, the population expanded with an influx of Gottscheers, an ethnic German population from Slovenia who were dislocated in the aftermath of World War I, and spoke the Gottscheerish dialect. Other Eastern Europeans came as well. As recorded in the 1920 United States Census, the population of Ridgewood was mostly working-class homeowners from Germany, Austria, or Italy, with a smaller population from Hungary, Ireland, Poland, and Sweden. The demographic figures remained relatively unchanged through the 1930 United States Census. The large German presence led to disputes following the rise of Nazi Germany, and a large, 9,000-person boycott of Nazi Germany in April 1934 resulted in brawls between Nazi sympathizers and Jewish Communist groups. Still, in the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City, workers for the Federal Writers' Project described Ridgewood and Bushwick as \\"old-fashioned and respectable\\", and said that Ridgewood \\"rivals Manhattan's Yorkville as a German center.\\" By the 1940 United States Census, Southern Europeans were also recorded as having moved into Ridgewood. In the mid-20th century, Romanians, Serbs, and Puerto Ricans arrived. By the late 20th century, Poles, Dominicans,New York Times: \\"Living in Ridgewood, Queens December 30, 2011\\"Growing up in Ridgewood, New York in the 1960s‚Äì1970s ‚Äì Part 1\\" by Gerard Demarigny March 23, 2010Polish Migrations: From Brooklyn to Queens, and back to Europe by Shuka Kalantari and Daniel Macht; retrieved January 1, 2012 and Ecuadorians‚Äîincluding a significant population of Quechua-speaking Amerindians from the Imbabura and Ca√±ar provinces of Ecuador‚Äîhad moved to Ridgewood.All Peoples Initiative: Quichua in New York and New Jersey August 2007 Other large populations included Yugoslavians, Chinese, Koreans, and Slovenians. = Late 20th century = Originally, Ridgewood and Glendale shared ZIP Code 11227 with Bushwick. Following the 1977 blackout, the communities of Ridgewood and Glendale expressed a desire to disassociate themselves from Bushwick. Residents voted on a proposal to create a new ZIP Code, and a majority of votes were cast in favor of the proposal. The communities were given the ZIP Code 11385 in 1980. By the mid-1980s, parts of Ridgewood had been given federal landmark designations. Young professionals were also moving to the neighborhood in large numbers, and Ridgewood's homeownership rates increased.

The entirety of Community Board 5, which comprises Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale, had 166,924 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. This is about equal to the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 22% are between the ages of 0‚Äì17, 31% between 25‚Äì44, and 26% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 8% and 13% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 5 was $71,234. In 2018, an estimated 19% of Ridgewood and Maspeth residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in seventeen residents (6%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 46% in Ridgewood and Maspeth, lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale are considered to be high- income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. Land use and terrain Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal ChurchRidgewood is zoned for various land uses, but is mostly commercial along main streets and residential along side streets. Large parts of the neighborhood are residential historic districts. In addition, the large Cemetery Belt is located directly to the south. The majority of the neighborhood covers a large hill, part of the glacial moraine that created Long Island, which starts at Metropolitan Avenue, rises steeply for about two blocks, then slopes down gently. For instance, at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Parish on 60th Place, the front entrance of the church is almost level with the second floor of the Parish school next door. Part of Ridgewood around the Linden Hill Cemetery, centered around Flushing and Metropolitan Avenues, was once known as Linden Hill, distinct from the neighborhood of Linden Hill in Flushing, Queens. Linden Street is named after this subsection of Ridgewood. =Residential= A typical block in RidgewoodRidgewood is a densely settled neighborhood, with housing stock ranging from six-family buildings near the Brooklyn border to two-family and single-family row houses deeper into Queens. Ridgewood is visually distinguished by the large amount of exposed brick construction, which is characteristic of the early-20th-century rowhouses built in the neighborhoods. Most of Ridgewood was developed block-by-block around the turn of the 20th century. Most of the buildings were designed by local architect Louis Berger & Co., which designed more than 5,000 buildings in the area. The neighborhood has been largely untouched by construction since then, leaving many centrally planned blocks of houses and tenements still in the same state as their construction. These blocks include the Mathews Flats (six-family cold water tenements), Ring-Gibson Houses (two- and four-family houses with stores), and Stier Houses (curved two-family rowhouses). Many of these houses are well-kept and retain much of their early 20th century appeal.Wilkinson, Christina.

The United States Post Office operates three post offices nearby: * Fresh Pond Station ‚Äì 60-80 Woodbine Street * Ridgewood Station ‚Äì 60-60 Myrtle Avenue * Wyckoff Heights Station ‚Äì 86 Wyckoff Avenue =Border with Bushwick= Arbitration Rock, where the county border was set in 1769 Today, Ridgewood's land area lies within Queens County. However, its political boundary with Brooklyn causes confusion and debate about where the western boundary of Ridgewood truly lies and whether part of Ridgewood is considered to be actually part of Brooklyn. The political dispute dates to the 17th century, when Newtown was under English rule and Boswijck was under Dutch rule. Disputes over the boundary between the two settlements continued until 1769, when a boundary line was drawn through what later became known as the Arbitration Rock. The street grid plan in Ridgewood and Bushwick was laid out in the late 19th century. Because the Arbitration Rock lay along a diagonal with this grid plan, numerous houses were built on the Brooklyn-Queens boundary, their owners sometimes subject to taxes from both counties. During the 19th century, this resulted in situations where some houses received water and fire protection from what was then the city of Brooklyn, while their neighbors in Queens had to rely on volunteer firefighting squads and paid exorbitant water bills to private utilities in Elmhurst. In 1925, the political boundary was adapted to the street grid, resulting in a zig-zag pattern. The change resulted in 2,543 persons' addresses being reassigned from Queens to Brooklyn, and 135 persons' addresses reassigned from Brooklyn to Queens. Modern addresses in the two boroughs can be distinguished by the presence or absence of a hyphen in the house number. Queens's house numbering system uses a hyphen between the closest cross-street (which comes before the hyphen) and the actual address (which comes after the hyphen). While buildings fronting on streets that are west of Forest Avenue and the Bay Ridge Branch follow the Queens address numbering system, the avenues which run parallel to the county line‚Äîbounded by Metropolitan Avenue to the north, Forest Avenue to the east, and the Brooklyn border to the south‚Äîdo not follow this address numbering system. Streets in this area that run perpendicular to the county line are demarcated by a jump in numbering sequence between the two boroughs. = ZIP Code changes = Since at least 1898, when the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens were created as part of the City of Greater New York, Glendale and Ridgewood's postal mail had been routed through the main Brooklyn post office in Williamsburg, rather than the main post office in Flushing, because they are located closer to Williamsburg. When ZIP Codes were assigned in 1963, the neighborhoods were assigned Brooklyn ZIP Codes with the 112 prefix, along with all areas whose mail was routed through a Brooklyn post office. This gave Glendale and Ridgewood a Brooklyn mailing address despite actually being located in Queens. The neighborhoods' ZIP Code of 11227 was shared with Bushwick, Brooklyn, as well as with Wyckoff Heights on the border of the two boroughs. After the 1977 New York City blackout, newspapers around the country published UPI and Associated Press photos of Bushwick residents with stolen items and a police officer beating a suspected looter, and Bushwick became known for riots and looting.Examples: \\"Policeman Discourages a Looting Suspect in the Bushwick Section of Brooklyn\\" (photo).

Early life On September 8, 1960 Bill Campbell was enrolled in Murphey Elementary School in Raleigh, North Carolina at the age of seven, thus becoming the first black student to attend an all-white school in Raleigh City Schools. He later recalled, \\"My family prepared me by simply saying this. 'This is important, and you‚Äôre going to have to do it. You‚Äôre going to have to endure it'.\\" Campbell's parents also tried to enroll Campbell's older brother, Ralph, and his older sister but he was the only one approved for entry. Campbell was accepted by his teacher and immediate classmates, but his presence upset some of the parents of other students. Some of the older students bullied him, and his parents received bomb threats. Campbell remained the only black student at Murphey for five years. He later graduated from William G. Enloe High School. =University= Campbell received a B.A. from Vanderbilt University, and a J.D. from Duke University Law School. He is a member of Omega Psi Phi. Mayor of Atlanta Campbell was heartily endorsed by outgoing mayor Maynard Jackson, and won the 1993 election. During his first term, his major accomplishments included overhauling the city's finance department, passing a major bond issue to pay for infrastructure improvements for the 1996 Olympics, rebuilding the public housing system, and modernizing the legal, public works, and water departments. Violent crime rates also dropped significantly during his tenure. According to Douglas A. Blackmon, Campbell was seen as a \\"post‚Äìcivil rights movement black politician who would leverage the economic rebirth of Atlanta, build a bridge to white voters, and become a U.S. senator or a Georgia governor\\". Campbell subsequently fell into disfavour during his second term, despite defeating then-president of the Atlanta City Council, Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.. The 1997 race was known for its emphasis on the racial overtones often not publicly seen in the African-American community, with Campbell being the lighter-skinned candidate and Arrington the darker complexioned. Campbell would later be criticized for deploying anti-Black racist messaging in an attempt to deflect criticism of his record as mayor.CNN.com - Embattled Atlanta mayor raises racial tension - October 9, 2000 Campbell was succeeded by Shirley Franklin. Following his tenure as mayor, he moved to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, where he worked as a practicing attorney. He was disbarred by order of the Supreme Court of Florida as a result of his tax evasion conviction. =Failure of Atlanta Empowerment Zone= In November 1994, the Atlanta Empowerment Zone was established, a 10-year, $250 million federal program to revitalise Atlanta's 34 poorest neighbourhoods including the Bluff.

The charges came from a five-year federal investigation into possible corruption during his time as Mayor of Atlanta. Campbell was later acquitted on all charges relating to the indictments; although on March 10, 2006, a federal jury convicted him on three counts of tax evasion. He was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Story to 30 months in prison for the three counts on tax evasion. He was also ordered to serve a year on probation, pay $6,000, and pay more than $60,000 in back taxes. On August 21, 2006 he reported to the Federal Correctional Institution in Miami, Florida. Campbell was released from prison in December 2007 after receiving a shortened sentence by enrolling in a drug treatment program. This came just a short time after he told a federal judge that he was not struggling with a drug abuse problem. It was reported that the New York Times that ‚ÄúPrison officials said inmates must offer documentation of prior substance abuse to enter the treatment program, but for privacy reasons they said they could not disclose whether Mr.Campbell submitted such proof.‚Äù Mr. Campbell statements to the judge wasn't used to determine whether or not he could enter the program.

M. Bhole, Essays on Gandhian Socio-Econic, Shipra Publications, Delhi, 2000. Chapter 14: Swadeshi: Meaning and Contemporary Relevance] This movement started in 1906 against the Partition of Bengal. It was one of the most successful movements against the British rule, primarily organized and led by .Swadeshi was a key focus of Mahatma Gandhi, who described it as the soul of Swaraj (self-rule). It was the most significant movement in Bengal and was also known as the Vande Mataram movement in Andhra Pradesh , India. The movement ended in 1911. Background  Etymology  The word Swadeshi is a conjunction (sandhi) of two Sanskrit words, \\"Swa\\" and \\"Desh\\", meaning \\"self\\"/\\"own\\" and \\"country\\" respectively. Swadeshi, as an adjective means \\"of one's own country\\".  History  * 1850 to 1904: Developed by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, G. V. Joshi, and Bhaswat K. Nigoni. This was also known as the First Swadeshi Movement. * 1905 to 1917: Began in 1905, against the partition of Bengal ordered by Lord Curzon. * 1918 to 1947: The idea of Swadeshi was further shaped by Gandhi, leading to the independence of India from British Rule. * 1991: Widespread curbs on international andion of then obsolete technology during the license-permit raj. * 1991 and onward: Beginning of liberalization, privatization, and globalization in independent India. Foreign capitals, technologies and many other goods were not excluded and the doctrine of export-led growth resulted in modern industrialism. Baba Ram Singh Kuka of the Sikh Namdhari sect was also credited for the Swadeshi movement as his own movements heightened around 1871 and 1872 which inspired Bengalis and other Indians to fight against British rule. Baba Ram Singh instructed Namdharis to wear Indian clothes only and boycott foreign goods. The Namdharis resolved the conflict in the peoples court and totally avoided British law and British courts. They also boycotted the educational system as Baba Ram Singh prohibited children from attending British School among other forms and measures he employed.

The Post-Independence Swadeshi movement arose as a reaction to more authoritarian capitalist policies, while the Pre- Independence movement was primarily a response to colonial policies in the post-Second World War, India wanted to keep up with the advanced markets of the west for a country emerging from two decades of colonial injustice. Though rapid industrialization was aimed at enabling a self-sufficient India under the framework of the Five-Year Plans, the need to align it with a largely agrarian economy was urgent. This need to preserve the old fabric of an agrarian country, while simultaneously modernizing, necessitated a resurgence of a slightly recast \\"Swadeshi Movement\\". Forerunners of this resurgent movement were noted journalists, writers, and critics, including S. R. Ramaswamy. Later, the movement was joined by an Indian social activist Rajiv Dixit, a famous yoga instructor Swami Ramdev, and a social worker, Pawan Pandit.MINISTRY of AYUSH Letter- https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-AY8yyuVlsOWWdkVEQ3Nmx3R0E =National Handloom Day= On 7 August 2015, Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, instituted and celebrated the first annual \\"National Handloom Day of India\\" to promote indigenous hand loom and khadi products.

It contains the Sunnyside Gardens Historic District, one of the first planned communities in the United States. The name \\"Sunnyside\\" originates with the Bragaw family, French Huguenots who had purchased the land in 1713 and named their estate \\"Sunnyside Hill\\". Sunnyside was a rural hamlet mostly consisting of small farms and marshland. It was incorporated into Long Island City in 1870, and developed into a bedroom community after the Queensboro Bridge was completed in 1909.

Each private residence has a small front garden facing the street and a private garden in the rear. The rental units in the two- and three-family houses enjoy private terraces overlooking the gardens. There are two configurations: the courtyard condition and the mews condition; at the edges of the community some homes simply line the street, with a common walkway running the length of the row. Homes in the courtyard blocks enclose an inner courtyard that was designated a common, landscaped but not used for recreation. Each homeowner actually owned, and paid taxes on, the part of the common in the block and lot, even if it was not used. The mews houses face a common front court and back on alleys; each mews house also has a private rear yard. This model allowed for denser residential development, while also providing ample open/green-space amenities. Clarence Stein and Henry Wright served as the primary architects and planners for this development (Frederick L. Ackerman designed some of the mews houses), and the landscape architect was Marjorie Sewell Cautley.Community and Library History, Queens Public Library.

Covering 77 acres between Queens Boulevard and the Sunnyside Railroad Yards, Sunnyside Gardens was constructed between 1924 and 1928 by the City Housing Corporation, founded by developer Alexander Bing, and architects Clarence Stein and Henry Wright. The project grew out of discussions in the early 1920s about housing and planning; social critic Lewis Mumford and economist Richard T. Ely were leading participants. In the early years of the Great Depression, nearly 60 percent of the residents lost their homes to foreclosure.Kroessler, Jeffrey A., Building Queens: the urbanization of New York's largest borough. Ph.D. dissertation, CUNY Graduate School, 1991. Those difficult years saw organized resistance by residents who forcefully resisted efforts by city marshals to evict families. The character of Sunnyside Gardens was protected by 40-year easements which protected the integrity of the courtyards and common walkways and controlled changes to the exterior of every property, extending to even paint color. Those covenants lapsed in the mid-1960s, and some homeowners rushed to claim their property, erecting fences into the middle of some courtyards. In response, in 1974 the Department of City Planning designated Sunnyside Gardens a special planned community preservation district, together with Fresh Meadows, Parkchester, and the Harlem River Houses. With that designation came rules protecting the inner courts and landscaping, and prohibiting driveways and curbcuts, rear sheds, and additions. =Sunnyside Gardens Historic District= The Sunnyside Gardens Historic District is a national historic district that includes 66 contributing buildings and 12 contributing sites. See also: It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and as a city historic district in 2007. Sunnyside Gardens is a park that takes up approximately three and a half acres, also known as a New York City landmark. It was built between 1924 and 1928, roughly taking up 16 blocks, which consists more than 600 buildings. It has 12 courts within the landmark, which are known as Carolin Gardens, Colonial Court, Hamilton Court, Hamilton Court Apartments, Harrison Place, Jefferson Court, Lincoln Court, Madison Court North and South, Monroe Court Apartments, Phipps Garden Apartments I, Phipps Garden Apartments II, Roosevelt Court, Washington Court, and the Wilson Court. Sunnyside Gardens is located in the Northwestern part of Queens which was established by Clarence Stein, Henry Wright and the City Housing Corporation were led by Alexander Bing. The creators of the Sunnyside Gardens wanted to create housing which would be inexpensive to residents to stop the shortages and overcrowding of other areas. In 2003, a grassroots movement started to request designation as a New York City Historic District, in response to lack of protection for the historic character of the homes in the neighborhood. The campaign was contentious and garnered publicity in major news outlets, including WNYC and the New York Times. On April 17, 2007, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (NYCLPC) held a public hearing on the neighborhood, which was controversial, with 60 people speaking in favor and 25 against the designation. This was documented on New York Public Radio in a segment called \\"Cloud Over Sunnyside?\\". On June 26, 2007, the NYCLPC voted to designate the community. The designation prevents most major work from being done without consultation with the NYCLPC.

High priests are typically more experienced leaders within the priesthood. The term derives in part from the Epistle to the Hebrews, which describes Jesus as \\"a high priest after the order of Melchizedek\\" (5:10; see also 6:20). Movement founder Joseph Smith ordained the first high priests on June 3, 1831.High priest , The Joseph Smith Papers (accessed December 28, 2011). High priests are organized into quorums. The first president of a high priests quorum of the church was Smith's younger brother, Don Carlos Smith. High priests in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church), high priests are primarily responsible for the spiritual welfare of the members and the administration of local church units called wards and stakes. Melchizedek priesthood holders in the church are ordained high priests when they become a member of a stake presidency, stake high council, or bishopric, \\"or when otherwise determined by the stake president\\".\\"Ordinance and Blessing Policies\\", Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) ¬ß 16. Ordinations are approved by the member's bishop and stake president and the common consent of the general priesthood membership in the stake. A man must hold the Melchizedek priesthood and hold the priesthood office of elder before he may become a high priest. Ordination is done by another high priest by the laying on of hands. Like other priesthood offices in the LDS Church, high priests are organized into quorums. The high priests quorum is organized at the stake level, with the president of the quorum being the stake president. (In contrast, priesthood quorums for the offices of deacon, teacher, priest, and elder are organized at the ward level.) Prior to the church's April 2018 General Conference, the stake president would organize a high priest \\"group\\" in each ward. Each group was provided with a group leader, who typically selected two assistants and a secretary to assist him. However, following changes announced in general conference, the high priest groups were to disbanded at the ward level. The high priest quorum on the stake level henceforth would consist of high priests currently serving in the stake presidency, as a high councilor, in a bishopric, or as a functioning patriarch. High priests not currently serving in those callings would join their ward's elders quorum.http://fox13now.com/2018/03/31/lds-church- announces-they-will-discontinue-high-priests-groups/ In a district, there is no high priests quorum. Men holding the office of high priest join the elders quorum of the branch they live in. There are a number of positions in the LDS Church which may only be filled by a high priest. Among these are the stake president and his counselors, members of a stake high council, mission president, and member of a temple presidency. A bishop must be a high priest [unless he has a right-by-lineage to the calling (see D&C; 107:69)]. Bishop's counselors are usually high priests, but there are some exceptions. (For example, the church does not require counselors in some young single adult wards to be ordained high priests.) Any high priest may become a member of the First Presidency, but in recent practice most members of the First Presidency have been apostles.The last man to serve as a counselor in the First Presidency without first being ordained an apostle was J. Reuben Clark, though he was ordained an apostle during his tenure in the First Presidency in order to establish his apostolic seniority and thus determine his order of succession to the presidency of the church. Since 1995, individuals ordained to the office of seventy are ordained first to the office of high priest.

Established by friends and classmates in August 1992, the company is best known for the first-person shooter series Serious Sam as well as the 2014 puzzle game The Talos Principle.  History  CCO Davor Hunski (left) and CTO Alen Ladavac at the Game Developers Conference 2015 Croteam was founded in the Utrina neighbourhood of Zagreb in late August 1992 by friends and classmates Davor Hunski, Damir Peroviƒá, Roman Ribariƒá, and Dean Sekuliƒá. The core team was later expanded with Marko Sekuliƒá, Alen Ladavac, Tomislav Pongrac, Admir Elezoviƒá, Davor Tomiƒçiƒá, Damjan Mravunac, Dinko Paviƒçiƒá and Petar Ivanƒçek, of whom Ladavac, Elezoviƒá and Tomiƒçiƒá are sometimes also referred to as founders. Their first video game was Football Glory, a football game which was published by Black Legend for the Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200 platforms in 1994, and then for PC in 1995. Sensible Software threatened legal action against Croteam, asserting that Football Glory was a clone of their video game Sensible Soccer. Croteam ceased further development on the title and released it as freeware in 1998. Their second video game, titled Save the Earth, was a children's game based on a Croatian TV series and released for the Amiga 4000. One year later, Croteam finished Five-A-Side Soccer, an indoor soccer version of Football Glory for the Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200. A long hiatus followed, broken by the first title of the Serious Sam series, Serious Sam: The First Encounter in 2001, followed by Serious Sam: The Second Encounter in 2002. Both Serious Sam games debuted on Microsoft Windows and utilised Croteam's in-house Serious Engine. In 2002, Serious Sam for the Xbox was released, which consisted of both games with the additional number of cinematics, an updated scores system, combos, multikills, auto-aiming and other console specific features. A sequel, Serious Sam 2 for both PC and Xbox was released on 11 October 2005, using Serious Engine 2. In 2007, development began on Serious Sam 3: BFE, a prequel to the original game. In 2010, Croteam released high definition remakes of the original Serious Sam games with upgraded textures and models, enhanced engine, user interface and audio, and additional features. Serious Sam 3: BFE was released for Windows in November 2011, soon followed by macOS and Linux versions. The Xbox 360 version of Serious Sam 3: BFE was released on Xbox Live Arcade in September 2012, and later made its way to PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network in March 2014. In December 2014, Croteam released the first-person puzzle game The Talos Principle for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. Ladavac left Croteam to join Google's Munich-based branch in October 2019 and work on the Stadia project.  Croteam Incubator  In 2015, Croteam began operating a business incubator programme to support small indie game development teams based in Croatia. This programme provides teams with office space and technology, as well as occasionally financial support. In March 2018, the division was formally announced as Croteam Incubator, at the time with six studios in the programme, all of them based in the same Zagreb office. Among the first games released under the Croteam Incubator banner were I Hate Running Backwards, Tormental, and Battle Bolts. Ribariƒá acts as the division's president, Nikola Mosettig as vice president, Damjan Mravunac as chief operating officer, and Zeno ≈Ωokalj as marketing and public relations manager.  Serious Engine  For development of Serious Sam: The First Encounter, Croteam developed the Serious Engine (formerly named S-Cape3D), a proprietary game engine, which, while similar to other engines at the time, was designed to render large environments and support a large number of enemies visible at any time. Serious Engine 2 was developed alongside Serious Sam 2, adding in support for a physics engine, refraction, detailed textures, and high dynamic range lighting. Serious Engine 3 was used to support the high-definition remakes of The First Encounter and The Second Encounter for release on Windows and Xbox 360, adding in true high-dynamic lighting support. As Croteam wanted to target more platforms with the release of Serious Sam 3: BFE, Serious Engine 3 was heavily reworked to support seventh-generation consoles, and became Serious Engine 3.5. With the introduction of eighth- generation consoles, Croteam continued to improve the Serious Engine, releasing it as Serious Engine 4, which premiered with The Talos Principle. Serious Engine 4 is also expected to be used for the upcoming Serious Sam 4, with Croteam claiming it can support up to 100,000 enemies on screen at any time. In honour of Serious Sam: The First Encounter 15th anniversary in 2016, Croteam released the source code for the first Serious Engine under an open- source licence.

He is known for his work on the perceptual form of urban environments and was an early proponent of mental mapping. His most influential books include The Image of the City (1960), a seminal work on the perceptual form of urban environments, and What Time is This Place? (1972), which theorizes how the physical environment captures and refigures temporal processes. A student of architect Frank Lloyd Wright before training in city planning, Lynch spent his academic career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, teaching there from 1948 to 1978. He practiced site planning and urban design professionally with Carr/Lynch Associates, later known as Carr, Lynch, and Sandell.  Biography  =Early life and education= Lynch was born as the youngest child of an Irish-American family on January 7, 1918. He was raised in the Hazel Avenue neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. After graduating from the Francis Parker School in 1935, Lynch matriculated at Yale University intending to study architecture. Finding its pedagogy too conservative, he left to study under Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Lynch later stated that Wright was a great influence, but disagreed with his individualistic social philosophy. Leaving Wright after a year and a half, he enrolled at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York to study engineering in 1939, but did not complete the program and went to work for Chicago architect Paul Schweikher. In 1941, Lynch married Anne Borders, a fellow graduate of the Parker School. Three weeks after his wedding, Lynch was drafted into the Army Corps of Engineers, serving in the Philippines and Japan through 1944. After the war, he completed his undergraduate education at MIT and received a Bachelor's degree in city planning in 1947. =Academic career= After graduation, Lynch began work in Greensboro, North Carolina as an urban planner but was soon recruited to teach at MIT by Lloyd Rodwin. He began lecturing at MIT the following year, becoming an assistant professor in 1949, a tenured associate professor in 1955, and a full professor in 1963. In 1954, after receiving a grant from the Ford Foundation to study urban form in Italy, Lynch and his MIT teaching colleague Gyorgy Kepes were awarded a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study perceptions of the urban environment and urban form.The Rockefeller Foundation grant was the first in a series of awards made during the 1950s and early 1960s to researchers studying urban design. Other recipients included Jane Jacobs, Ian McHarg and Edmund Bacon. In 1958 Lynch wrote an essay ‚ÄòThe theory of urban form‚Äô with Lloyd Rodwin where the city is described through the complementary of two systems ‚Äì flows and adapted spaces ‚Äì interpreted starting from a group of descriptive categories of urban form. Lynch and Kepes' research was published in 1960 as Lynch's book The Image of the City. In 1970, Lynch received funding from UNESCO to study the use of cities by young people in urban areas of Salta, Melbourne, Toluca, and Krakow, a project summarized in his book Growing Up in Cities (1977). Lynch provided seminal contributions to the field of City Planning through empirical research on how individuals perceive and navigate the urban landscape. His books explore the presence of time and history in the urban environment, how urban environments affect children, and how to harness human perception of the physical form of cities and regions as the conceptual basis for good urban design. Parallel to his academic work, Lynch practiced planning and urban design in partnership with Stephen Carr, with whom he founded Carr/Lynch Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts. =Later life= Lynch became professor emeritus in 1978, but continued to write and practice architecture. He died of a heart attack at his summer home at Gay Head on Martha's Vineyard on April 25, 1984.  The Image of the City  Lynch's most famous work, The Image of the City (1960), is the result of a five-year study on how observers take in information of the city. Using three American cities as examples (Boston, Jersey City and Los Angeles), Lynch reported that users understood their surroundings in consistent and predictable ways, forming mental maps with five elements: * paths, the streets, sidewalks, trails, and other channels in which people travel; * edges, perceived boundaries such as walls, buildings, and shorelines; * districts, relatively large sections of the city distinguished by some identity or character; * nodes, focal points, intersections or loci; * landmarks, readily identifiable objects which serve as external reference points. In the same book, Lynch also coined the words \\"imageability\\" and \\"wayfinding\\". Image of the City has had important and durable influence in the fields of urban planning and environmental psychology.  Personal life  Anne Borders Lynch and Kevin Lynch were married in 1941 and had four children. The Lynches were long-term residents of Martha's Vineyard, where Anne continued spending her summers until her death in 2011.

Fashion and availability  Bungee balls were a fad in February 1991 and most bungee balls were sold during this time period. After March 2003, they started vanishing from stores partly due to controversy over what was contained inside them. They were also discontinued in many stores because often after about 4‚Äì7 hours of use, the Bungee Ball's bungee cord would snap, and the ball itself would break, releasing synthetic liquid.

Bibbo Bibbowski first appeared in Adventures of Superman #428 (May 1987) and was created by Jerry Ordway and Marv Wolfman. He is based on Jerry Ordway's real life friend, Jo Jo Kaminski, described as a \\"hard as nails softie\\". Fictional character biography Bibbo first appears in a Suicide Slum bar called the Ace o' Clubs. When Superman comes in looking for information, Bibbo, thinking this is \\"some clown in a Superman suit\\", punches Superman, damaging his hand. He gains respect for the Man of Steel. He would later refer to Superman as his \\"fav'rit\\" hero. During the Eradicator saga, Bibbo teams up with Lobo and Raof, a teleporter and a tribute to Marvel's Nightcrawler, to witness Lobo kill Superman. Lobo gives Bibbo a set of special goggles that will record the battle. All three, however, get drunk on Okarran liquor and thus suffer loss of all memory of the battle, which Superman won by a ruse engineered by the Eradicator artifact. Additionally, Bibbo wore the goggles backwards, and thus the entire recording was of his reactions. As a result, the aliens who retained Lobo to kill Superman have no proof that there even was a battle. Bibbo becomes a more significant part of the comic when he finds a winning lottery ticket dropped by Gangbuster and uses the money to buy the Ace o' Clubs bar and to help those living in the slum. Bibbo as seen in the Reign of the Supermen story arc Bibbo attempts to assist Superman when Superman becomes involved in a drawn-out fight against the murderous Doomsday. Bibbo works with Professor Hamilton on a plan to blast Doomsday with a large laser. They score a direct hit, but the monster is not affected. When Doomsday and Superman ultimately kill each other, Bibbo is on the scene and helps Hamilton use a device to try to perform CPR on Superman, despite the risk of the device killing Bibbo himself. The plan fails and Bibbo is injured. Hamilton takes over the CPR but also fails.Adventures of Superman #498 (January 1993) Shortly afterward, Bibbo encounters a young man who, his family rendered homeless by Doomsday's rampage, is blatantly selling \\"Death of Superman\\" commemorative souvenirs during a public commemoration honoring the Man of Steel. At first outraged at the man's crassness, Bibbo feels some sympathy for his losses and buys his entire inventory in order to get him off the street, then offers him a job at the Ace O' Clubs.Superman: The Man of Steel #20 (February 1993) While Superman is gone, Bibbo takes to putting on a 'disguise' of sorts and helping out on the streets. Around this time he saves a man from suicide. This is mostly told through tall tales concerning various super-villains.Showcase '96 #10 (November 1996) Bibbo briefly takes care of a small white dog named Krypto whom he had saved from drowning, not to be confused with the Kryptonian dog of the same name. The name was supposed to be \\"Krypton\\", but the engraver Bibbo hired to make a name tag made an intentional mistake, trying to extort more money from Bibbo (the price accorded was for six letters). Bibbo took the tag as it was.Adventures of Superman #502 (July 1993) A poster seen by the hero Aztek indicates that at one point, Bibbo fought the hero Wildcat during a charity boxing event.Aztek #4 (November 1996) Later in the series, The Ace O' Clubs bar is the site of a battle between the life-force devouring Parasite and Aztek.Aztek #7 (February 1997) Bibbo and his friends purposely ignore the fight, playing cards instead and trusting others to handle the villain. In The Power of Shazam!, Ordway introduces Professor Bibbowski, Bibbo's pacifist scientist brother. Bibbo reappears in Superman #679, shown as one of the champions of Metropolis that the villainous Atlas defeated. He is established by then as having worked in the Ace of Clubs, even bringing himself to boldly menace Atom Smasher for \\"Talking trash about Sooperman\\".Justice Society of America #27 (July 2009) Bibbo returns in 2016 Superman #4. He is seen arm-wrestling Hacken and easily beating him, before Superman's fight with Eradicator moves into his bar. Bibbo is shocked to see what appears to be Superman running away from the fight, but quickly realizes Superman is simply trying to lure Eradicator somewhere when there are no innocent bystanders. Later Bibbo and his niece show up in Superwoman. When Ultrawoman takes over Metropolis, Bibbo is seen trying to start a fight with her minions but is saved by Natasha Irons and Traci 13. Perry White recommends Clark and Lois take their son over to Bibbo's 'Ace O' Clubs' for burgers.

Hydrology The term phreatic is used in hydrology and the earth sciences to refer to matters relating to ground water (an aquifer) below the water table (the word originates from the Greek phrear, phreat- meaning \\"well\\" or \\"spring\\"). The term 'phreatic surface' indicates the location where the pore water pressure is under atmospheric conditions (i.e. the pressure head is zero). This surface normally coincides with the water table. The slope of the phreatic surface is assumed to indicate the direction of ground water movement in an unconfined aquifer. The phreatic zone, below the phreatic surface where rock and soil is saturated with water, is the counterpart of the vadose zone, or unsaturated zone, above. Unconfined aquifers are also referred to as phreatic aquifers because their upper boundary is provided by the phreatic surface. Speleology In speleogenesis, a division of speleology, 'phreatic action' forms cave passages by dissolving the limestone in all directions,New Mexico: Bureau of Mines & Mining Bulletin 117 (Part I: Discussion of Deposits and Events) as opposed to 'vadose action', whereby a stream running in a cave passage erodes a trench in the floor. It occurs when the passage is full of water, and therefore normally only when it is below the water table, and only if the water is not saturated with calcium carbonate or calcium magnesium carbonate. A cave passage formed in this way is characteristically circular or oval in cross-section as limestone is dissolved on all surfaces. Many cave passages are formed by a combination of phreatic followed by vadose action. Such passages form a keyhole cross section: a round-shaped section at the top and a rectangular trench at the bottom. Volcanology A phreatic eruption or steam-blast eruption occurs when magma heats ground or surface water.

She was named for James Lawrence. Lawrence was laid down 14 August 1919 and launched 10 July 1920 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Ruth Lawrence, and commissioned 18 April 1921, Lt. Cmdr. J. E. Wellbrook in command. History After shakedown Lawrence was assigned to the Destroyer Force Atlantic Fleet. Departing Newport, Rhode Island 13 June 1922, the destroyer sailed for the Mediterranean and joined Naval Forces at Constantinople 4 July. For the next year she cruised in the eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea during the Crimean crisis. During this time of upheaval throughout the Near East and south Russia, she rendered aid to American commercial personnel, Red Cross workers, and U.S. Food Administration officials who were assisting the stricken inhabitants. Lawrence together with other American destroyers also evacuated thousands of Greek refugees from areas of Asia Minor which had been occupied by Turkish Forces. The destroyer returned to New York 30 October 1923, and resumed operations with the Scouting Fleet. She departed New York 3 January 1924 to join in Army-Navy exercises which tested the defenses and facilities of the Panama Canal. In August of that year Lawrence was stationed off Labrador during the Army around the world flight, returning to Boston, Massachusetts in September to resume operations with the Scouting Fleet. For the next 3 years she performed reserve training cruises, maneuvers along the east coast and engaged in simulated attack exercises on the Hawaiian Islands. Lawrence detached from the Scouting Fleet 11 February 1927, and sailed off the coast of Nicaragua to protect American lives and property during the Civil War then underway in that country. The destroyer departed the Nicaraguan coast 5 weeks later, and she resumed her cruising cycle with the Scouting Fleet, continuing these operations until she decommissioned at Philadelphia 6 January 1931. Lawrence recommissioned 13 June 1932, Lt. Cmdr. T. E. Downey in command, and departed Philadelphia 15 August to join the Pacific Fleet. From her arrival San Diego, California 8 September until 1938, she operated continuously with Pacific destroyer squadrons, engaging in fleet tactical and strategic exercises along the coast and fleet problems off the Panama Canal Zone and Hawaii. She decommissioned at San Diego 13 September 1938. World War II Once again Lawrence recommissioned 26 September 1939, Cmdr. H. D. Clarke in command, and sailed 2 months later for maneuvers and patrol in the Caribbean. Following training operations, she arrived at Boston 1 March 1940, and later that month was assigned to the east coast sound school at New London, Connecticut. The destroyer conducted tactical exercises along the east coast until 3 December when she steamed for the Pacific. Arriving at San Francisco, California on the 27th, she was later assigned to the Sound School at San Diego, continuing these operations until America's declaration of war on Japan. During the early months of the war the destroyer performed convoy escort operations between San Francisco and Seattle, Washington. Lawrence departed San Francisco 13 August 1942 to escort a troop convoy en route to Kodiak, Alaska, arriving there 7 days later. For the next month the destroyer covered convoy approaches between Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, and Adak before returning to San Francisco 27 September. Based at Treasure Island, California for the rest of the war, Lawrence served on patrol and escort operations to the approaches of San Francisco Bay. On 31 May 1944, the destroyer rescued 192 men of SS Henry Bergh which had grounded on the Farallon Islands, then resumed patrol and escort operations. After the war, Lawrence departed San Francisco 28 August 1945, arriving Philadelphia 20 September. She decommissioned at Philadelphia 24 October 1945 and was sold to Boston Metal Company, Baltimore, Maryland, on 1 October 1946.

Proponents of a diagnostic model for sexual addiction consider it to be one of several sex-related disorders within hypersexual disorder. The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges, behaviors, or thoughts. Related or synonymous models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), erotomania, Don Juanism (or Don Juanitaism), and paraphilia-related disorders. The concept of sexual addiction is contentious. There is considerable debate among psychiatrists, psychologists, sexologists, and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction, and therefore its classification and possible diagnosis. Animal research has established that compulsive sexual behavior arises from the same transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate drug addiction in laboratory animals; however, sexual addiction is not a clinical diagnosis in either the DSM or ICD medical classifications of diseases and medical disorders. Some argue that applying such concepts to normal behaviors such as sex can be problematic, and suggest that applying medical models such as addiction to human sexuality can serve to pathologise normal behavior and cause harm. The ICD-11 created a new condition classification, compulsive sexual behavior, to cover \\"a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour\\". Classification None of the official diagnostic classification frameworks list \\"sexual addiction\\" as a distinct disorder. =DSM= The American Psychiatric Association (APA) publishes and periodically updates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), a widely recognized compendium of mental health diagnostics. The version published in 1987 (DSM-III-R), referred to \\"distress about a pattern of repeated sexual conquests or other forms of nonparaphilic sexual addiction, involving a succession of people who exist only as things to be used.\\"American Psychiatric Association. (1987). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (3rd ed., rev.). Washington, DC: Author. The reference to sexual addiction was subsequently removed. The DSM-IV-TR, published in 2000 (DSM-IV- TR), did not include sexual addiction as a mental disorder.American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition, text revision). Washington, DC: Author. Some authors suggested that sexual addiction should be re-introduced into the DSM system; however, sexual addiction was rejected for inclusion in the DSM-5, which was published in 2013.Psychiatry's bible: Autism, binge-eating updates proposed for 'DSM' USA Today. Darrel Regier, vice-chair of the DSM-5 task force, said that \\"[A]lthough 'hypersexuality' is a proposed new addition...[the phenomenon] was not at the point where we were ready to call it an addiction.\\" The proposed diagnosis does not make the cut as an official diagnosis due to a lack of research into diagnostic criteria for compulsive sexual behavior, according to the APA. =ICD= The World Health Organization produces the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is not limited to mental disorders. The most recent approved version of that document, ICD-10, includes \\"excessive sexual drive\\" as a diagnosis (code F52.7), subdividing it into satyriasis (for males) and nymphomania (for females). However, the ICD categorizes these diagnoses as compulsive behaviors or impulse control disorders and not addiction. The most recent (yet unapproved) version of that document, ICD-11, includes \\"compulsive sexual behavior disorder\\"\\" as a diagnosis (code 6C72)‚Äîit does not use the addiction model. =CCMD= The Chinese Society of Psychiatry produces the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD), which is currently in its third edition the CCMD-3 does not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis. =Other= Some mental health providers have proposed various, but similar, criteria for diagnosing sexual addiction, including Patrick Carnes, Aviel Goodman, and the late Jonathan Marsh. Carnes authored the first clinical book about sex addiction in 1983, based on his own empirical research. His diagnostic model is still largely utilized by the thousands of certified sex addiction therapists (CSATs) trained by the organization he founded. No diagnostic proposal for sex addiction has been adopted into any official government diagnostic manual, however. During the update of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to version 5 (DSM-5), the APA rejected two independent proposals for inclusion. In 2011, the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the largest medical consensus of physicians dedicated to treating and preventing addiction, redefined addiction as a chronic brain disorder, which for the first time broadened the definition of addiction from substances to include addictive behaviors and reward-seeking, such as gambling and sex. =Borderline personality disorder= The ICD, DSM and CCMD list promiscuity as a prevalent and problematic symptom for Borderline Personality Disorder. Individuals with this diagnosis sometimes engage in sexual behaviors that can appear out of control, distressing the individual or attracting negative reactions from others. There is therefore a risk that a person presenting with sex addiction, may in fact be suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder. This may lead to inappropriate or incomplete treatment. =Medical reviews and position statements= In November 2016, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT), the official body for sex and relationship therapy in the United States, issued a position statement on Sex Addiction that states that AASECT, \\"...does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder, and does not find the sexual addiction training and treatment methods and educational pedagogies to be adequately informed by accurate human sexuality knowledge. Therefore, it is the position of AASECT that linking problems related to sexual urges, thoughts or behaviors to a porn/sexual addiction process cannot be advanced by AASECT as a standard of practice for sexuality education delivery, counseling or therapy.\\" In 2017, three new USA sexual health organizations found no support for the idea that sex or adult films were addictive in their position statement. In 16 November 2017 the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (ATSA) published a position against sending sex offenders to sex addiction treatment facilities. Those centers argued that \\"illegal\\" behaviors were symptoms of sex addiction, which ATSA challenged they had no scientific evidence to support. Possible mechanisms Animal research involving rats that exhibit compulsive sexual behavior has identified that this behavior is mediated through the same molecular mechanisms in the brain that mediate drug addiction. Sexual activity is an intrinsic reward that has been shown to act as a positive reinforcer, strongly activate the reward system, and induce the accumulation of ŒîFosB in part of the striatum (specifically, the nucleus accumbens). Chronic and excessive activation of certain pathways within the reward system and the accumulation of ŒîFosB in a specific group of neurons within the nucleus accumbens has been directly implicated in the development of the compulsive behavior that characterizes addiction. In humans, a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, characterized by drug-induced compulsive engagement in sexual activity or gambling, has also been observed in some individuals taking dopaminergic medications. Current experimental models of addiction to natural rewards and drug reward demonstrate common alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection. ŒîFosB is the most significant gene transcription factor involved in addiction, since its viral or genetic overexpression in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for most of the neural adaptations and plasticity that occur; it has been implicated in addictions to alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, nicotine, opioids, phenylcyclidine, and substituted amphetamines. ŒîJunD is the transcription factor which directly opposes ŒîFosB. Increases in nucleus accumbens ŒîJunD expression can reduce or, with a large increase, even block most of the neural alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ŒîFosB). ŒîFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. Natural rewards, like drugs of abuse, induce ŒîFosB in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological addictive state.Table 1\\" Thus, ŒîFosB is also the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards as well, and sexual addictions in particular, since ŒîFosB in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the reinforcing effects of sexual reward. Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that psychostimulants and sexual reward possess cross-sensitization effects and act on common biomolecular mechanisms of addiction-related neuroplasticity which are mediated through ŒîFosB. Treatment = Counseling = As of 2017, none of the official regulatory bodies for Psycho-sexual Counseling or Sex and Relationship therapy, have accepted sex addiction as a distinct entity with associated treatment protocols. Indeed, some practitioners regard sex addiction as a potentially harmful diagnosis and draw parallels with gay conversion therapy. As a result, treatment for sex addiction is more often provided by addiction professionals in the counseling field than psychosexual specialists. These counseling professionals typically hold advanced degrees of education including Master's degrees or Doctorates in counseling or a related field like psychology. These counselors can also hold certifications like Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC-S) who are required to hold a Master's degree or higher level of education. Therapists and Psychologists usually also hold a Master's in a related field of study. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a common form of behavioral treatment for addictions and maladaptive behaviors in general. Dialectical behavior therapy has been shown to improve treatment outcomes as well. Certified Sex Addiction Therapists (CSAT) a group of sexual addiction therapists certified by the International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals offer specialized behavioral therapy designed specifically for sexual addiction.Stefanie Carnes. Mending a Shattered Heart: A Guide for Partners of Sex Addicts. Gentle Path Press; Second Edition. (4 October 2011) page 139 Their treatments have yet to be subject to peer-review, so it is unclear if they help or harm patients. =Support groups= =Medications= Antiviral drugs The term \\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\\" (PrEP) generally refers to the use of antiviral drugs to help prevent AIDS. PrEP is an optional treatment for people who are HIV-negative, but have a substantial risk of getting an HIV infection. In the US, most insurance plans cover these drugs. Epidemiology According to a systematic review from 2014, observed prevalence rates of sexual addiction/hypersexual disorder range from 3% to 6%. Some studies suggest that sex addicts are disproportionately male, at 80%.https://www.1843magazine.com/features/can-you-really-be-addicted-to-sex History Sex addiction as a term first emerged in the mid-1970s when various members of Alcoholics Anonymous sought to apply the principles of 12-steps toward sexual recovery from serial infidelity and other unmanageable compulsive sex behaviors that were similar to the powerlessness and un- manageability they experienced with alcoholism. Multiple 12-step style self- help groups now exist for people who identify as sex addicts, including Sex Addicts Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, and Sexual Compulsives Anonymous. Society and culture =Controversy= The controversy surrounding sexual addiction is centered around its identification, through a diagnostic model, in a clinical setting. As noted in current medical literature reviews, compulsive sexual behavior has been observed in humans; drug-induced compulsive sexual behavior has also been noted clinically in some individuals taking dopaminergic drugs. Moreover, some research suggests compulsive engagement in sexual behavior despite negative consequences in animal models. Since current diagnostic models use drug- related concepts as diagnostic criteria for addictions, these are ill-suited for modelling compulsive behaviors in a clinical setting. Consequently, diagnostic classification systems, such as the DSM, do not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis because there is currently \\"insufficient peer- reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders\\". A 2014 systematic review on sexual addiction indicated that the \\"lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\\" There have been debates regarding the definition and existence of sexual addictions for decades, as the issue was covered in a 1994 journal article.Francoeur, R. T. (1994). Taking sides: Clashing views on controversial issues in human sexuality, p. 25. Dushkin Pub. Group. The Mayo Clinic considers sexual addiction a form of obsessive compulsive disorder and refer to it as sexual compulsivity (note that by definition, an addiction is a compulsion toward rewarding stimuli). A paper dating back to 1988 and a journal comment letter published in 2006 asserted that sex addiction is itself a myth, a by-product of cultural and other influences. The 1988 paper argued that the condition is instead a way of projecting social stigma onto patients. \\"Love addiction\\" falls into the same controversial area as well since it refers to a frequent pattern of intimate relationships which can be a by product of cultural norms and commonly accepted morals. In a report from 2003, Marty Klein, stated that \\"the concept of sex addiction provides an excellent example of a model that is both sex-negative and politically disastrous.\\" Klein singled out a number of features that he considered crucial limitations of the sex addiction model and stated that the diagnostic criteria for sexual addiction are easy to find on the internet. Drawing on the Sexual Addiction Screening Test, he stated that \\"the sexual addiction diagnostic criteria make problems of nonproblematic experiences, and as a result pathologize a majority of people.\\" =Popular culture= Sexual addiction has been the main theme in a variety of films including Diary of a Sex Addict, I Am a Sex Addict, Black Snake Moan, Confessions of a Porn Addict, Shame, Thanks for Sharing, Don Jon, and Choke.

In English terms, \\"win-win\\" maybe the correct translation. Sang(Áõ∏) means \\"mutual\\" or \\"together\\" and Saeng(Áîü) means \\"live\\" or \\"survive\\". Because of its literal meaning, mutual life-giving or win-win, this term is used by Korean politicians very often. Importance However, just a simple, literal translation of mutual life-giving or win-win is not all of its meaning. Before understanding Sangsaeng further, it is recommended that you understand Cosmic year because the meaning of Sangsaeng can be explained in more detail in the context of Cosmic year. Sangsaeng is necessary because governing principles in Early Heaven (cosmic spring, summer) and Later Heaven (cosmic autumn, winter) are different. In Early Heaven, the principle of Sanggeuk(Áõ∏ÂÖã : mutual conflict) governs all lives. Therefore, all lives in the world are suffering even though they do not want. However, in Later Heaven, the principle of Sangsaeng(Áõ∏Áîü : mutual life-giving) governs all lives in the world. Application In daily life, mutual life-giving is to work for the well-being of others, and at the time of gaebyeok, the focus of mutual life- giving will be to save life. Sharing teachings with others is also an act of mutual life-giving. Throughout history people have prospered at the expense of others, but in Jeungic philosophy, from now on people can only prosper by benefiting others. Quote from Dojeon :Our work is the practice of helping others do well. After others prosper, we need only to take what remains and our work will be accomplished. :Dojeon 2:15:8 :Now that the whole world is being united into one home, all people become one family in which harmony abounds 8 and saving life becomes a virtue. :Dojeon 2:16:7 See also * Boeun (Offering Gratitude and Repayment) Â†±ÊÅ© * Cosmic Year ** Shao Yung * Dojang Dao center ÈÅìÂ†¥ * Dojeon Sacred text of Jeung San Do ÈÅìÂÖ∏ * Gaebyeok * Haewun (Resolution of Bitterness and Grief) Ëß£ÊÄ® * Jeung San Do * Sangjenim ‰∏äÂ∏ù * Tae Eul Ju mantra Â§™‰πôÂë™ * Taemonim Â§™ÊØç * Wunshibanbon (Returning to the Origin) ÂéüÂßãÂèçÊú¨ Jeung San Do ","title":"Sangsaeng"},{"id":"1797009","text":"Guam competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. 22 competitors, 16 men and 6 women, took part in 27 events in 8 sports.

Appearing as an elderly man wearing a tuxedo and thick-framed glasses, he is usually shown stepping slowly off a bus before he suddenly performs a frenetic dance to an instrumental version of the Vengaboys song \\"We Like to Party\\" to invite stressed and overworked people to Six Flags. Origin According to USA Today, Mr. Six is the creation of Doner Advertising of Southfield, Michigan. The success of the ad became such that Six Flags toured the vintage bus featured in the ad to all of its 31 parks and sold T-shirts based on the Mr. Six advertisement. Mr. Six also appeared on the nationally broadcast U.S. TV morning show Good Morning America. The first airing introduced Mr. Six as an apparently elderly, slow-moving man dressed in his trademark tuxedo and large glasses, pulling up in front of a house in a retro-style bus. The occupants of the house are sitting around the front yard apparently very bored. Mr. Six slowly shuffles off the bus, then suddenly starts performing a high-energy dance routine as \\"We Like to Party\\" begins playing, and invites the bored family to Six Flags. The dance he performs borrows moves from the Melbourne shuffle, jumpstyle, and Techtonik. Subsequent ads showed different variations of Mr. Six dancing and inviting people to Six Flags. The role was, initially, non-speaking. Mr. Six impersonators A Halloween costume based on the likeness of Mr. Six. On July 9, 2004, Six Flags Great America held a contest to find the best person who could impersonate the new \\"Ambassador of Fun\\" Mr. Six and dance like him. The reward would be $2,500 cash and other small prizes. About 200 people, who wore tuxedos and red bow ties, went out onto the stage and danced. The winner of the contest was 13-year-old Jordan Pope. Jim Crowley, Six Flags Great America marketing director, said, \\"Jordan truly embodies the spirit of Six Flags!...He had Mr. Six's unique dance moves down to a science, the crowd went wild when he took the stage!\\"\\"Prophetstown, Illinois Resident Bags $2,500 in Mr. Six Look-Alike Contest at Six Flags Great America\\" at PRnewswire.com Retirement and revival On November 29, 2005, Daniel Snyder, owner of the NFL's Washington Redskins, took over Six Flags and on the very next day, he announced the retirement of the ad campaign. Snyder said that Mr. Six was \\"pointless.\\" Mr. Six and the \\"It's Playtime!\\" motto would be dropped and Six Flags' next ad campaign would be called \\"Friendly, Clean, Fast, Safe, Service.\\" (Despite this, the mascot was still prominently featured at Six Flags theme parks on merchandise until his revival in 2009.) The Mr. Six campaign was replaced by the \\"More Flags, More Fun\\" campaign, which introduced an unnamed Asian character shouting the tagline at viewers. On February 2, 2009, Mr. Six began appearing in place of the unnamed Asian character in the \\"More Flags, More Fun\\" ads on the Six Flags website. In March 2009, Six Flags announced the return of Mr. Six to promote their 2009 season opening in numerous press releases. Mr. Six also resumed appearances in a number of new television commercials where he dances and says the \\"More Flags, More Fun\\" tagline, alongside his sidekick Little Six, a much younger version of himself. Mr. Six appeared as a bobblehead in the Six Flags New for 2017 Announcement video. Though Mr. Six was popular with the general public and park-goers, the character was described in a Time Magazine opinion piece as \\"creepy\\". Parodies *Mr. Six was parodied on a 2008 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Tina Fey. In the sketch, NBC has over-scheduled The Apprentice and dozens of spinoffs have been created, including one in which the contestants are TV commercial characters. Donald Trump (played by Darrell Hammond) asks Mr. Six (played by Amy Poehler) if he would dance for him. Mr. Six says he'd rather not, but the skit ends with Mr. Six next to Trump dancing to \\"We Like to Party\\". *Mr. Six is also parodied in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Celebrity Rocket\\". In a sketch, Mr. Six appears at the site of a car accident and whisks all involved to Six Flags (including a woman, a man, a cop, and a fatality in a body bag). At one point, he dances behind the woman in a very provocative manner, causing the cop to yank him away from her. At the end, Mr. Six begins driving them away from Six Flags only to cause another fatal accident. As the bus passengers look on at the horrifying results, Mr. Six begins dancing again. The cop gets annoyed and shoots him in the head.

He has been described as \\"the father of modern mountain rescue in Scotland\\". He made an attempt to climb Everest in 1953, and is credited with inventing the first all-metal ice-axe, and a lightweight stretcher, widely used in mountain and helicopter rescue. Early life He was born Hamish McInnes in Gatehouse of Fleet, in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Galloway, Scotland, in 1930. He was the youngest child, having three sisters and a brother eighteen years older than himself. His father served in the Chinese police in Shanghai, then returned to join the British army and the Canadian army during World War I. By the age of 16, MacInness had already climbed on the Matterhorn, and at age 17 had built his own motor car. Achievements He made the first winter ascent of Crowberry Ridge Direct and of Raven's Gully on Buachaille Etive M√≤r with Chris Bonington in 1953. He designed the first all-metal ice axe, and is credited with introducing the short ice axe and hammer with inclined picks for Scottish winter work in the early 1960s. He pioneered the exploration of the Glencoe cliffs for winter work with the Glencoe School of Winter Climbing and for many years led the area's Mountain Rescue team. He is recognised as having developed modern mountain rescue in Scotland, setting up the Search and Rescue Dog Association and the Avalanche Information Service, and inventing the MacInnes stretcher, which is used for rescues worldwide. In 1975, MacInnes was deputy leader to Bonington's Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition, which included Dougal Haston and Doug Scott.\\"MacInnes 1975\\" from the American Alpine Journal Vol 20; Number 2; Issue 50; (1976) p.357 Although never an official member, MacInnes climbed extensively with the Creagh Dhu, Glasgow-based climbing club as well as with the rival Aberdeen clubs and joined forces with Tom Patey to make the first winter traverse of the Cuillin Ridge on Skye. He was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2003 and received the Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture in 2008. He has been involved with a number of films, as climber, climbing double and safety officer, including The Eiger Sanction and The Mission, and has written numerous books on mountaineering, including the International Mountain Rescue Handbook (1972), regarded as the standard manual worldwide, and Callout (1973), his classic account of his experiences leading the Glencoe Rescue team. MacInnes acquired a number of nicknames within the mountaineering community, most noteworthy of which are 'The Fox of Glencoe' and 'MacPiton'. Awards and honours MacInnes was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to mountaineering and mountain rescue in Scotland in the New Year's Honours list of December 1978.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/47723/data.pdf He received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1992, and Stirling University in 1997. Personal life Hamish Macinnes lived in Glen Coe for many years. Until 1998, he resided at 'Allt Na Reigh' a cottage within the glen that was subsequently purchased by the sex offender, Jimmy Savile. =Illness and recovery= In 2014, MacInnes suffered a urinary tract infection which rendered him severely confused and suffering from delirium. He was 'sectioned' into a psychiatric hospital in the Scottish Highlands. From there he made multiple attempts to escape, including scaling up the outside of the hospital to stand on its roof. Eventually recovering from the illness, he was left with no memory of his former life. In 2018 a documentary film was produced for BBC Scotland, titled Final Ascent:The Legend of Hamish MacInnes. Introduced by his friend, Michael Palin, it recounts the story of MacInnes's life and achievements, and how he used archive footage, his photographs and his many books to \\"recover his memories and rescue himself\\".

He married Miss Gertrude Boucher on June 27, 1917, attending his wedding with his head bandaged from a car accident in that morning while driving in a storm. He had been cut by flying glass from the windshield. Graduating from the Naval Academy as an ensign, Childs was assigned to the USS Culgoa, a refrigerated supply ship. His next assignment was to the USS Celtic another refrigerated supply ship. In June 1916 he was assigned to the battleship USS Montana. Promoted to lieutenant, he served in World War I in the submarine L-2. However, while serving as an observer on the British submarine HMS H5, Childs was killed on March 2, 1918 when the H5 was mistaken for a German U-boat by a British merchant ship off the coast of Wales. The SS Rutherglen deliberately rammed the H 5, sending the submarine to the bottom with the loss of her entire crew. Namesake The destroyer USS Childs was named for him.

Ella, the barmaid at the pub, is secretly in love with Bob. Eventually, Jenny loses interest once Bob has spent all his savings on her. The Siege of Pleasure relates Jenny's early life as a servant, and her descent into prostitution. Bob and Ella do not feature at all in this novel. The Plains of Cement focuses on Ella, and is set during the events in The Midnight Bell, although from a different perspective. Ella, still nursing an untold affection for Bob, has to deal with the increasingly unwelcome advances of Ernest Eccles, an elderly customer of the pub. The narrative concludes one day after the final scene of The Midnight Bell.  Adaptations  The 1963 film Bitter Harvest was based on the trilogy. In the 1990s the novels were adapted for BBC Radio Four in three episodes. BBC: Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky Retrieved 26 Jan 2019 In 2005, the books were serialised as Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky starring Sally Hawkins, Zoe Tapper and Bryan Dick. It was shown on BBC Four, accompanied by the documentary Words, Whisky and Women. The three-part drama was also released on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray.

Many climbers consider him the father of modern bouldering.Sherman, John (1994). Stone Crusade: A Historical Guide to Bouldering in America, American Alpine Club Press. Early life and professional career As a child, Gill lived in several southern U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Georgia, where he graduated from Bass High School in 1954. He attended Georgia Tech from 1954 to 1956, and graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in mathematics in 1958. He entered the U.S. Air Force as a second lieutenant, and also attended a special graduate meteorology program at the University of Chicago in 1958 and 1959. He was assigned to Glasgow AFB in Montana until 1962, and resigned from the USAF Reserves as a captain several years later. After obtaining a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Alabama in 1964, Gill became an instructor at Murray State University from 1964 to 1967. In 1967 he enrolled as a graduate student at Colorado State University, and received his PhD in classical complex analysis in 1971. His dissertation on M√∂bius transformations was supervised by Arne Magnus. During his career as a college professor, Gill wrote approximately thirty research papers on the analytic theory of continued fractions, complex functions, linear fractional transformations, and related topics.J.

Climbing Classics #2, Stackpole Books Bouldering Pennyrile Forest, KY in the mid-1960s. John Gill began mountain and rock climbing in 1953 as a traditional climber. By the mid-1950s he had begun to specialize in very short, acrobatic routes on outcrops and boulders, establishing problems in the 1950s and early 1960s considerably harder than those existing at the time. Being a gymnast and thinking of climbing as an extension of gymnastics rather than hiking, in the mid-1950s he introduced the use of gymnastic chalk into American rock climbing. The use of chalk then spread internationally throughout the climbing world. At the same time he introduced controlled dynamics, recommending it as a technique of choice, as well as one of necessity. According to Alpinist magazine, \\"his introduction of chalk and dynamic movement marked the beginning of modern climbing in America.\\"Editors,Alpinist Magazine #12, 2005 Gill's climbing style showed the influence of formal gymnastics. He emphasized form and grace of motion over simple efficiency, the cornerstone of contemporary climbing. His performances, as recorded on film taken when he was forty (Disciples of Gill, 2009), demonstrate straight lines and minimal contact with the rock. He preferred an application of strength and sometimes avoided efficient moves like the heel hook, which he considered unaesthetic. Gill's approach to bouldering ‚Äì artistic style being on par with difficulty ‚Äì was rarely followed by climbers of his generation and is considered unusual today, difficulty remaining paramount. He also practiced bouldering as a form of moving meditation. Although certainly not the first serious boulderer -- his notable predecessors include Oscar Eckenstein (1859‚Äì1921) and Pierre Allain (1904‚Äì2000) -- Gill was probably the first climber in the history of rock climbing to make bouldering his primary specialty and to advocate acceptance of bouldering as a legitimate sport in its own right. His focus on bouldering and the high difficulty level climbs he established inspired a number of traditional climbers to take a more serious view of the sport, which, for the most part had been seen merely as training for longer roped climbs. After retiring, Gill spent several years researching the origins of rock climbing, particularly bouldering. He also compiled a chronicle of bodyweight feats associated with climbing. These results, along with a history of gymnastic rope climbing, may be found on his website. Gill received the 2008 American Alpine Club's Robert & Miriam Underhill Award for outstanding climbing achievement. =Early bouldering & short climbs= Gill on Red Cross Rock Eliminate V9. With initial fingertip hold on the right the problem is V7. In the Tetons, in 1958, John Gill climbed a short route on Baxter's Pinnacle that lies in the 5.10 realm, before that grade was formally recognized -- one of the first to be done in America.>Ament, Pat (2002). Wizards of Rock: A History of Free Climbing in America, Wilderness Press By the end of the 1950s, Gill had reached what would now be considered V9 levels on a few eliminate boulder problems. (He later stated he probably never progressed beyond V10 throughout his climbing career.). Two of his problems on Red Cross Rock in the Tetons -- a V8 in 1957 and a V9 in 1959 -- set new standards of bouldering difficulty. And his 1961 route on a steep face of a small granite spire named the Thimble (Needles of South Dakota) -- an unrehearsed and unroped 30-foot 5.12a free- solo climb (or V4 or V5 highball)-- is considered one of the great classics of modern climbing, and -- if considered a climb (as Gill did) -- may well be the first at the 5.12 grade.Climbing Magazine, Millennium Special, March (2000) Gill climbed the route without the benefit of modern climbing shoes, significantly increasing the difficulty of the climb. =\\"B\\" Grading system= In the 1950s, John Gill introduced a very early ‚Äì if not the first ‚Äì grading system specifically designed for bouldering and not restricted to a particular area. The system, (B1, B2, B3), had two subjective levels of difficulty, and one objective level, and was predicated on prevailing and future standards attained in traditional rock climbing. The introduction of sport climbing some twenty years later and more intense competition weakened the philosophical underpinnings of the three-tiered structure, although climbers such as Jim Holloway adopted personal three-level systems similar to Gill's. Today, Gill's B-system is rarely used, abandoned in favor of open-ended grading systems such as the V-scale. Longer climbs - free solo explorations From his early ascent of the east face of Longs Peak in 1954 , throughout his climbing career until he left the sport in the early 2000s, a recurring theme of Gill‚Äôs climbing was exploratory free soloing (at times with a light rappel rope) - usually, but not always, at moderate levels of difficulty. In fact, the Thimble ‚Äì which he considered a climb and not a boulder problem - was a test of how far he was willing to go in that direction. John Gill's WebsiteAmerican Alpine Club video interview with Jim McCarthy, November (2019) Once he completed a route (most were unreported) he might return to it, perhaps many times, to enjoy the continuous movement and flow of the climb. Gymnastics and strength exercises John Gill, performing a one arm front lever in the late 1960s. Gill is known for his applications of gymnastics to rock climbing. As an amateur gymnast in the 1950s, 6'2\\" and 180 pounds, Gill specialized in the competitive rope climb and the still rings, achieving a time of 3.4 seconds for the 20' rope climb (from seated position on the floor, arms only) and accomplishing a number of difficult stunts on the rings, including inverted and olympic crosses, giant swings, and slow pulls from hang to handstand. He also engaged in what are now called bodyweight exercises similar to gymnastics, achieving seven one-arm pullups with the right arm and five with the left, several one-finger one-arm pullups, one-arm pullups carrying twenty pounds, one-arm pullups on a one-half inch ledge, and one-arm front levers.

History In March 1984, the Metropolitan Transit Development Board signed an agreement with the shortline holding company Railtex to resume freight service on the SD&AE; line from San Diego; Kyle Railways discontinued freight operations in 1983. The new railroad, the San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad (SDIY), which commenced operations on October 15, 1984, did not want to invest the $5.5 million necessary to repair the collapsed tunnels and bridges in the Carrizo Gorge. CZRY Shareholders Gary Sweetwood and Benny L. Wright of local construction company East County Dirt Works, however, believed that the investment would be worthwhile and negotiated trackage rights on the line. The agreement required a fee of 6.9% imposed by SDIY, for the gross revenues from any freight on the SD&AE;'s Desert Line and a fee of 2% by the SD&AE; Railway Company. Photo of San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway trestle in Carrizo Gorge. In 2000, FNM, owner of the Tijuana-Tecate segment, was privatized, transferring the administration to the State of Baja California. On July 1, 2000, CZRY won the bid by the Administrator of the Tijuana-Tecate short line to operate as a technical-operational entity for rail service of the federally owned 44 miles from border to border, after SDIY exited operations of the segment. The CZRY later reopened the Desert Line in April 2004. Carrizo Gorge Trestles Sand hauling was the primary business for the CZRY from 1999 to 2005. The sand was used in making ready-mixed concrete for the construction markets in San Diego County, as it was loaded from Lindero to Campo and later from the Imperial Valley desert near Silica to Campo until 2007. There was also minor traffic of other goods between the U.S. and Mexico, mainly lumber for import. Rail car storage is another source of revenue on the east end of the Desert Line. In October 2008, facing deteriorating conditions in the Desert Line and preparation for transportation projects in Baja California, the railroad embargoed the line from Plaster City to Campo for all revenue freight. CZRY discontinued operations of the Tijuana-Tecate segment in the end of 2011. The contract was renewed in favor of Baja California Railroad, Inc. by the government of Baja California. In December 2012, SD&AE;, owner of the line, entered into a 50-year operating lease with the Pacific Imperial Railroad company for freight trains. The lease requires that certain operating goals and repairs be completed in a specific time frame. The lease also calls for a $1,000,000 yearly payment for the rights to operate freight trains, or 15% gross revenues, or any qualified value.\\"San Diego MTS Report\\" http://www.sdmts.com/MTS/documents/2012-12-13BOARDPKG_000.pdf With this lease, the operating rights of CZRY ended.

It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with around 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States. It has also been widely introduced in Europe, Asia and South America, and it is legally considered an invasive species in many countries. Distribution and habitat Channel catfish Channel catfish are native to the Nearctic, being well distributed in lower Canada and the eastern and northern United States, as well as parts of northern Mexico. They have also been introduced into some waters of landlocked Europe (Czech Republic and Romania) and parts of Malaysia and almost as many parts of Indonesia. They thrive in small and large rivers, reservoirs, natural lakes, and ponds. Channel \\"cats\\" are cavity nesters, meaning they lay their eggs in crevices, hollows, or debris, to protect them from swift currents. In Canada, the species is largely, though not exclusively, limited to the Great Lakes watershed from Lake Nipigon southward. Characteristics Chuck the Channel Catfish, 1986 roadside sculpture in Selkirk, Manitoba Canada Channel catfish possess very keen senses of smell and taste. At the pits of their nostrils (nares) are very sensitive odor-sensing organs with a very high concentration of olfactory receptors. In channel catfish, these organs are sensitive enough to detect several amino acids at about one part per 100 million in water. In addition, the channel catfish has taste buds distributed over the surface of its entire body. These buds are especially concentrated on the fish's four pair of barbels (whiskers) surrounding the mouth ‚Äî about 25 buds per square millimeter. This combination of exceptional senses of taste and smell allows the channel catfish to find food in dark, stained, or muddy water with relative ease. They also possess a Weberian apparatus, which amplifies sound waves that would otherwise not be perceivable. Length and weight Weight vs. length for Channel Catfish, where b = 3.2293 and L_1 = 45.23 cm. A member of the American catfish genus Ictalurus, channel catfish have a top-end size of about 40‚Äì50 pounds (18‚Äì23 kg). The world record channel catfish weighed 58 pounds, and was taken from the Santee-Cooper Reservoir in South Carolina, on July 7, 1964. Realistically, a channel catfish over 20 lb (9 kg) is a spectacular specimen, and most catfish anglers view a 10-lb (4.5-kg) fish as a very admirable catch. Furthermore, the average size channel catfish an angler could expect to find in most waterways would be between 2 and 4 pounds. Channel catfish often coexist in the same waterways with its close relative, the blue catfish, which is somewhat less common, but tends to grow much larger (with several specimens confirmed to weigh above 100 lb). As channel catfish grow longer, they increase in weight. The relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between length (L, in cm) and weight (W, in kg) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form: :W = (L/L_1)^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, L_1 is the length of a typical fish weighing 1 kg. For channel catfish, b = 3.2293, somewhat higher than for many common species, and L_1 = 45.23 cm. =Feeding= Catfish have enhanced capabilities of taste perception, hence called the ‚Äúswimming tongue‚Äù, due to the presence of taste buds all over the external body surface and inside the oropharyngeal cavity. Specifically, they have high sensitivity to amino acids, which explains their unique communication methods as follows. The catfish has a facial taste system that is extremely responsive to L-alanine and L-arginine. More specifically, their facial taste system senses heightened levels of L-amino acids in freshwater. Feeding behavior to food is due to amino acids released by food. This is reported to cause maxillary and mandibular barbell movements, which orient the catfish's posture and food search. When the food stimulates the taste receptors, it causes more excitation which see as exaggerated biting, turning, or mastication. =Communication= The channel catfish is adapted to limited light conditions. Members of the genus Ictalurus, which inhabit muddy waters, do not depend solely on visual cues. Instead, they are known to rely heavily on chemotaxic cues. Sound production may be another important means of communication among channel catfish and other species living in turbid habitats. Chemical communication The North American channel catfish is an ostariophysan, or a bony fish occupying a freshwater habitat. These fishes are known to produce club cells and alarm substances for communication purposes. Both the fish's habitat and the presence of chemosensory cells covering the body are presumably the results of favored selection for this method of communication. Catfishes are capable of producing and recognizing individual specific pheromones. Through these pheromones, a catfish can identify not only the species and sex of a conspecific, but also its age, size, reproductive state, or hierarchical social status. Territoriality in channel catfish is identifiable by a change in body odor, which is recognizable by other members of the same species. This chemical change in the amino-acid composition of the skin mucus can be noted by chromatographic methods, and are not long-lasting; rather, they last only long enough to communicate to other fish in the vicinity. Changes may be the result of the release of the contents of the club cells. These cells do not open directly to the surface of the skin, but injury caused by fighting and other agonistic behaviors may release the cells‚Äô contents. Since catfish have a dominance hierarchy system, information relative to the change of status of any fish is important in recognition of the social strata. Signal distinction In the channel catfish, while a communication signal is directed toward the receiver and contains a specific message, an information signal is a part of the general existence of the individual or the group. For example, release of an alarm signal will communicate danger, but the individual's recognition odor is only an information signal identifying one fish from another. With regards to the function and contents of the club cells, the club cells may serve different functions throughout the fish's lifecycle. Variation in the contents of the club cells‚Äô information signals therefore may change with the species‚Äô needs at different stages of life. Sound production All species of catfishes can generate sound through stridulation, and many produce sounds through drumming. Stridulation consists of the clicking or grinding of bony parts on the fish's pectoral fins and pectoral girdle, and drumming consists of the contraction of specialized sonic muscles with subsequent reverberation through the swim bladder. Variability in the sound signals created by the channel catfish depends on the mechanism by which the sound is produced, the function of the resultant sound, and physical factors such as sex, age, and temperature. This variation may result in increased complexity of the outgoing signal and may allow for increased usefulness of the signal in interspecies communication. In the channel catfish, sounds are produced only by pectoral stridulation, as this species does not express sonic muscles. However, the swim bladder may still be used to help with audition. Due to the high density of water, sound travels 4.8 times faster and over longer distances under water than in air. Consequently, sound production via stridulation is an excellent means of underwater communication for channel catfish. The pectoral spine of the channel catfish is an enlarged fin ray with a slightly modified base that forms a complex articulation with several bones of the pectoral girdle. Unlike the other pectoral fin rays, the individual fin segments of the spine are hypertrophied and fused, except for at the distal tip. The surface of the spine is often ornamented with a serrated edge and venomous tissues, designed to deter predators. Sounds produced during fin abduction result from the movement of the base of the pectoral spine across the pectoral girdle channel. Each sweep of sound consists of a number of discrete pulses created by the ridges lining the base of the pectoral spine as they pass over the rough surface of the girdle's channel. The stridulation sounds are extremely variable due to the range and flexibility of motion in fin use. Different sounds may be used for different functions in communication, such as in behavior towards predators and in asserting dominance. In many channel catfish, individuals favor one fin or another for stridulatory sound production (in the same way as humans are right-handed or left-handed). The first ray of the channel catfish pectoral fin is a bilaterally symmetrical spinous structure that is minimally important for movement; however, it can be locked as a defensive adaptation or used as a means for sound production. According to one scholar, most fish tend to produce sound with their right fin, although sound production with the left fin has also been observed. Hearing The inferior division of the inner ear, most prominently the utricle, is considered the primary area of hearing in most fishes. The hearing ability of the channel catfish is enhanced by the presence of the swim bladder. It is the main structure that reverberates the echo from other individuals‚Äô sounds, as well as from sonar devices. The volume of the swim bladder changes if fish move vertically, thus is also considered to be the site of pressure sensitivity. The latency of swim bladder adaptation after a change in pressure affects hearing and other possible swim bladder functions, presumably making audition more difficult. Nevertheless, the presence of the swim bladder and a relatively complex auditory apparatus allows the channel catfish to discern different sounds and tell from which directions sounds have come. Communication to predators Pectoral stridulation has been considered to be the main means of agonistic communication towards predators in channel catfish. Sudden, relatively loud sounds are used to startle predators in a manner analogous to the well-documented, visual flash display of various lepidopterans. In most catfish, a drumming sound can be produced for this use, and the incidences of the drumming sounds can reach up to 300 or 400 per second. However, the channel catfish must resort instead to stridulation sounds and pectoral spine display for predator avoidance. In addition to communication towards predators, stridulation can be seen as a possible alarm signal to other catfish, in the sense of warning nearby individuals that a predator is near. Fishing Channel catfish caught in a stocked lake Channel catfish are omnivores, and can be caught using a variety of natural and prepared baits, including crickets, nightcrawlers, minnows, shad, freshwater drum, crawfish, frogs, bullheads, sunfish, chicken liver, hot dogs, and suckers. Catfish have even been known to take Ivory soap as bait and even raw steak. Juglines, trotlines, limb lines, and bank lines are popular methods of fishing for channel catfish in addition to traditional rod-and-reel fishing. Another method uses traps, either \\"slat traps\\" ‚Äî long wooden traps with an angled entrance ‚Äî and wire hoop traps. Typical bait for these traps include rotten cheese and dog food, or \\"stink bait\\", and old rotted shad work well. Catches of as many as 100 fish a day are common in catfish traps. An unusual method practiced in the Southeastern United States is noodling ‚Äì catching catfish by hand. When removing the hook from a catfish, anglers should be mindful of the sharp spines on the pectoral and dorsal fins.  Genetics  The channel catfish is one of only a handful of ostariophysan freshwater fish species whose genomes have been sequenced. The channel catfish reference genome sequence was generated alongside genomic sequence data for other scaled and unscaled fish species (other catfishes, the common pleco and southern striped Raphael; also common carp), in order to provide genomic resources and aid understanding of the evolutionary loss of scales in catfishes. Results from comparative genomics and transcriptomics analyses and experiments involving channel catfish have supported a role for secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (SCPP) in scale formation in teleost fishes. In addition to the whole nuclear genome resources above, full mitochondrial genome sequences have been available for channel catfish since 2003. Other studies of genetic diversity, outcrossing, etc. in channel catfish have focused primarily on inbred lines and farm strains of relevance to the aquaculture of this species. For example, earlier studies have compared the genetic diversity of domestic versus wild populations of channel catfish using AFLPs.

Dawn Wall In 1971, Robbins completed the second ascent, with Don Lauria, of the Dawn Wall on El Capitan, with the (controversial) intention of erasing the route as they climbed it. Their ascent closely followed the 1970 first ascent by Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell, completed with a heavy-handed reliance on bolts - a method that offended Robbins and other clean climbing advocates. Harding had left all his bolts in the rock; Robbins and Lauria used the bolts to repeat the climb; and Robbins then chopped the heads off the bolts behind them. After two pitches, Robbins stopped chopping the bolts because (according to Lauria) \\"the quality of the aid climbing was much higher than he had ever expected of Harding or Caldwell and, of course, it was also taking us an awful long time to chop all those goddam bolts.\\" Royal Robbins Clothing Following his success as a climber, Robbins founded an eponymous outdoor apparel company with his wife Liz Robbins.

Climbing philosophy in Advanced Rockcraft Robbins authored two seminal books, Basic Rockcraft and Advanced Rockcraft,Robbins, Royal, Advanced Rockcraft (La Siesta Press, Glendale, CA, 1973) which emphasized free climbing skills and a clean-climbing ethic. In a section of Advanced Rockcraft called Values, he described his climbing philosophy. He believes that \\"a first ascent is a creation in the same sense as is a painting or a song\\", and that choosing a climbing line may well be \\"an act of brilliant creativity\\". Another creative aspect of a first ascent involves the aids that the leader of the climb rejects. With modern technology of aid climbing available, a first ascent is more artistic if it consciously rejects the use of certain climbing aids that are not essential to the success of the climb. He places emphasis on using equipment which is non-destructive to the mountain environment. He opposes climbs done outside the accepted mores of a given climbing center, or the prevailing style of an area. He favors what he calls \\"upward variations\\", or completing a climb using more stringent standards than used on the first ascent. In Robbins' view, the decision to place a single piton is a matter of \\"enormous importance\\" because \\"like a single word in a poem, it can affect the entire composition\\". Kayaking In 1978, Robbins developed psoriatic arthritis, which prevented serious climbing. He took up adventure kayaking instead, completing first descents of challenging rivers from high mountain elevations. His early kayaking partners included Doug Tompkins and Reg Lake. In 1980, the three descended the San Joaquin River Gorge from Devil's Postpile to the Mammoth Pool Reservoir, 5000 feet lower and 32 miles away. In 1981, they carried their kayaks over Mount Whitney Pass at 13,777 foot elevation, into Sequoia National Park and descended 55 miles down the Kern Trench. In 1982, joined by Neusom Holmes, they descended the Middle Fork of the Kings River in Kings Canyon National Park, the largest and steepest of these three High Sierra descents. In 1983, Robbins descended the Tuolumne River in Yosemite National Park from Tuolumne Meadows to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. He was accompanied by Reg Lake, Chuck Stanley, Lars Holbek, John Armstrong and Richard Montgomery. He then developed an interest in descending smaller mountain creeks by kayak during their flood stage following heavy rains. His first such project in May, 1984 was the descent of Sespe Creek, which runs through the Los Padres National Forest. He was accompanied by Yvon Chouinard, Reg Lake, John Wasserman and Jackson Frischman. Robbins called this type of trip \\"flash boating\\", and later used the technique on the Fresno River, the Chowchilla River and the middle fork of the Mokelumne River.

It is owned and operated by the Meruelo Group. The hotel has 1,616 rooms, and the casino contains . The Sahara anchors the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip, at the corner of Sahara Avenue. It is the site of the northernmost station of the Las Vegas Monorail. The resort had initially operated under the Sahara name from 1952 to 2011. Originally, Milton Prell opened the Club Bingo casino on the site in 1947. In 1951, he gathered former business partners to begin work on the Sahara, which was built on the land partially occupied by Club Bingo. Del E. Webb Construction Company built the Sahara, which opened on October 7, 1952, as the sixth resort on the Las Vegas Strip. It featured an African theme. Martin Stern Jr. designed several hotel additions for the Sahara, including a 14-story tower that opened in 1960. The Sahara was sold to Del Webb in 1961, and a 24-story hotel tower, also designed by Stern, was opened in 1963. The Sahara began to decline in the 1960s with the opening of several large resorts nearby. Paul Lowden purchased the Sahara in 1982, and a third hotel tower was added in 1988. Lowden sold the Sahara to Bill Bennett in 1995, and Bennett launched a $100 million renovation of the resort that included a Moroccan theme. Bennett's renovation also added a NASCAR-themed attraction that included a restaurant and a roller coaster known as Speed ‚Äì The Ride. Sam Nazarian's SBE Entertainment Group, along with Stockbridge Real Estate Group, purchased the Sahara in 2007. The Sahara was closed on May 16, 2011, as it was no longer considered economically viable. In 2013, Nazarian began a complete renovation of the resort before reopening it as the SLS Las Vegas on August 23, 2014, as part of SBE's chain of SLS hotels. SLS Las Vegas featured a chic and modern design, and was targeted at southern California residents. The SLS experienced financial hardships after its opening, and Nazarian sold his stake to Stockbridge in 2015. One of the hotel towers was rebranded the following year as W Las Vegas, managed by Starwood as part of its W Hotels chain. The SLS was sold to Meruelo Group in 2018, and the W Las Vegas became part of the SLS again after the resort ended its relationship with Starwood. The SLS was renamed Sahara Las Vegas on August 29, 2019, as part of an ongoing renovation by Meruelo. History Before the Sahara was built, an earlier casino had operated on the site as Club Bingo. Around 1942, Melvin D. Close (1900‚Äì1974) purchased a 19-acre property on what would become the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. Club Bingo owner Milton Prell had previously opened the 30 Club in Butte, Montana. Prell and his family then moved to Las Vegas in 1945, with the intention of opening a small hotel. Remembering how successful his earlier casino club had been, Prell opened the similar Club Bingo in Las Vegas before building a full hotel- casino. Prell opened Club Bingo with Frank Schivo, who previously worked at the 30 Club. Schivo managed Club Bingo's casino. Club Bingo opened on July 24, 1947, on 4 acres of the 19-acre property, and it quickly became a success. Club Bingo included a 300-seat bingo parlor as well as the Bonanza Room, which provided food and entertainment. Entertainers included singer Dorothy Dandridge and comedian Stan Irwin. Irwin eventually became the entertainment director for Club Bingo. The Club Bingo building was considered basic, with the exception of an electric bingo board sign on top. Prell briefly considered adding a small hotel and a village of adobe buildings to the Club Bingo property, but he decided against the idea because it did not fit in with his ultimate vision of a luxury hotel. In early 1951, Prell gathered several former business partners to begin work on a hotel-casino project that would become the Sahara. In July 1951, Close announced he had sold the remaining land for $225,000 to the Club Bingo owners. Plans were simultaneously announced for a 200-room hotel project that would be built on the land. The site was considered ideal for the new resort because it was located just outside of city limits, allowing Prell and business partner Al Winter to avoid paying taxes on slot machines and property. At the time, the project was expected to cost $2 million. Winter, a co-owner of Club Bingo, recruited Sam Boyd to be a partner in the new Sahara project. Boyd had previously operated a bingo game for Winter in Oregon. Boyd invested in the Sahara to become an owner and partner. Real estate developer Del Webb and his top executive, L. C. Jacobson, helped arrange financing for construction, which was handled by Del E. Webb Construction Company. Jacobson was also a partner in the project, holding a 20-percent interest. The Sahara was originally set to open in summer 1952, but construction delays pushed back the opening date. =Early years= The $5 million Hotel Sahara opened on October 7, 1952, with an African Sahara theme. Attendees to the grand opening included Ray Bolger and Gus Greenbaum. It was the sixth resort to open on the Las Vegas Strip. Max Maltzman was the architect, and Ragnar Qvale was the interior designer. The Sahara utilized a modern and simple design. The North African desert theme was conveyed only minimally in the Sahara's architecture. Outside, the only depiction of the theme consisted of fake camels and Arabian people. The interior included statues of Arab guards. The Sahara was located on , employed 500 people, and contained 240 hotel rooms. The hotel consisted of two-story motel wings that formed a quadrangle around the pool. Each room included a patio or balcony. Other amenities included a casino, an 85-foot bar, and two restaurants: The Congo Room, which was the primary dining choice; and The Caravan, a coffee shop featuring hand-painted murals. These areas of the resort, as well as the Casbar Theatre, featured African images. Like at Club Bingo, Schivo managed the casino at the Sahara. Schivo's wife, Shirlee, would later help to decorate the hotel's interior during a refurbishment. Irwin also retained his position as entertainment director, responsible for arranging celebrity performances at the Sahara. The Sahara included the first Olympic-size swimming pool in Las Vegas, and would become the first hotel to host hydroplane races on Lake Mead. The Sahara Cup hydroplane races were first held in 1956, and continued for several years. In 1958, the hotel began sponsoring the Sahara Pro-Am golf tournament, played at an off-site golf course. It later became known as the Sahara Invitational. The hotel ended its sponsorship of the hydroplane races in 1959, stating that they had become too big of an event for a single organization to sponsor. Expansions Upon realizing that the resort needed more rooms, Prell hired Del Webb in 1954 to build additional units. The project took five months to construct, and was completed by 1955. Originally known as the Sahara Oasis Motel, the addition contained 192 rooms. It consisted of seven interconnected buildings, one of which connected to the main resort through an air-conditioned walkway. The addition was designed by Martin Stern Jr. as a two-story motel wing, built out in an \\"E\\"-like shape just south of the quadrangle structures. The addition marked Stern's first project in Las Vegas. Tunis Tower in 2011 In 1959, a $3.5 million construction and remodeling project began at Hotel Sahara, including the start of construction on a 14-story hotel tower. The tower was designed by Stern, and construction was handled by Del E. Webb Construction Company. It was built southeast of the hotel pool. Construction on the tower had reached the eighth floor in November 1959, and the project was topped out in early 1960. Aside from the tower, other new features included a coffee shop with seating for 300 people, and a 700-person convention hall, located on the resort's north side. The 14-story Sahara Tower (later the Tunis Tower) opened in June 1960, adding 204 additional rooms for a total of 604. It was the tallest building in Nevada at the time. A flashing, electric clock was located atop the tower. The clock included the time as well as the temperature, and was topped by a letter \\"S\\" sign. Also added was a 127-foot vertical roadside sign, designed by YESCO and installed in front of the resort. By July 1961, there were plans for a $2.5 million renovation of the Hotel Sahara. Also planned was a 24-story hotel tower, designed by Stern, that would cost $4.5 million. The project would also include a parking garage along the Las Vegas Strip. Del E. Webb Corporation completed a purchase of the Sahara later in 1961, by acquiring shares in its corporate owner, the Sahara-Nevada Corporation. At the time, state law for gaming licenses meant that every shareholder in a company would have to undergo the mandated investigations of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Because large corporations have many shareholders, this essentially prevented such companies from operating casinos in Nevada. Del Webb devised a plan to work around this issue by operating as a landlord, meaning its shareholders would not need to undergo investigations. A separate organization, Consolidated Casino Corporation, was set up by Del Webb to operate the casino. Jacobson, Prell and Winter owned Consolidated Casino Corporation, and Prell and Winter were also retained to serve, respectively, as chairman of the board and president of Sahara-Nevada Corporation. An expansion of the restaurant and lounge facilities was underway in late 1961, and an enlargement of the Casbar Theater was completed in early 1962. Alexandria Tower in 2011 A groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 9, 1962, for the $6 million, 24-story Sahara Skyscraper hotel tower, located next to the Sahara Tower. The new tower, built by Del Webb, was expected to measure 260 feet in height. It would add 400 rooms, for a total of 1,000. Three swimming pools, including the original Olympic pool, opened in April 1962, after construction and remodeling. A keno facility opened later that year, making the Sahara the second hotel on the Strip to offer the game. The House of Lords steakhouse opened in August 1962. It became a popular hangout among celebrities who performed at the Sahara, including the Rat Pack. The restaurant was modeled after the real House of Lords in the United Kingdom. By October 1962, construction on the new tower had reached its 17th floor. A Don the Beachcomber restaurant opened the following month. At the time, Prell and other Sahara executives sought to rename the adjacent San Francisco Avenue as Sahara Avenue. Beldon Katleman, owner of the former El Rancho Vegas across the street, objected to the proposal, stating that the road should be renamed after his hotel-casino property. Despite the opposition, the street was renamed after the Sahara. In early 1963, several new facilities were opened in a new three-story building as part of a $12 million expansion. These facilities included the Caravan Room coffee shop and a 1,000-seat convention hall. Don the Beachcomber and the House of Lords were also part of the three-story addition. Temporary walls had been put up to shield casino customers from construction of the new facilities. Plaque describing the Beatles' hotel stay in 1964. The 24-story hotel addition, eventually known as the Alexandria Tower, was opened in May 1963, with Nevada governor Grant Sawyer attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The clock and \\"S\\" sign were relocated from the original tower to the new tower. During 1963, to attract visitors, the casino introduced its Shower of Money, in which a selected participant would get into a plexiglass booth and be showered with $100,000 in money bills. The participant had one minute to push as much money as possible out through an opening in the booth, and that person would get to keep the ejected money. In August 1964, the Sahara paid $25,000 to have the Beatles perform in Las Vegas and stay at the resort, although their performance took place at the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center, as the Sahara's 600-seat showroom could not handle the crowd size of a Beatles concert. The Sahara would later display photos of the Beatles' visit to the resort. U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson stayed at the hotel in October 1964. In 1967, there were plans to add a $3 million, two-story convention facility to the Sahara. In July 1968, the hotel was nearing completion on the facility, known as the Sahara Space Center. The facility opened in September 1968, and hosted U.S. vice presidential candidate Spiro Agnew for a speech. The Sahara Space Center measured , and included seating for up to 5,000 people. Incidents A rooftop fire occurred at the Sahara in August 1964, causing nearly $1 million in damage. A work crew had been on the roof installing a sprinkler system, and the fire was believed to have been caused by a smoldering rag. Firefighters put it out with thousands of gallons of water, which soaked through the main casino area's ceiling and also flooded the main showroom. Las Vegas sheriff Ralph Lamb believed the fire to be more financially destructive than the one which destroyed the El Rancho Vegas, stating that it was \\"probably the biggest hotel fire we've ever had in Las Vegas.\\" Some gamblers had been hesitant to quit playing and evacuate the casino. Approximately 100 workmen began repairs immediately following the fire, and most of the affected facilities reopened the day after. For its reopening, the Sahara sign advertised, \\"Visit The Hottest Casino In Town.\\" Casino operations were moved to a recently completed casino addition, adjacent to the main casino, that was unharmed by the fire. Full repair work was expected to take 30 days. In May 1967, three men were arrested after planting a homemade bomb in a Sahara hotel room on the 12th floor, part of a failed extortion attempt. A note was left demanding $75,000 for information to disarm the bomb. The note also warned that bombs had been placed in two other hotels owned by Del Webb. Seven hotels in three states were evacuated, but no other bombs were found. In July 1968, a fire started on the roof of the casino building, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of people. A crew had been working on a rooftop air conditioning unit, and the fire was believed to have started from a spark created by welding equipment. The fire caused an estimated $1 million in damage to the main casino area, the hotel's executive offices, the coffee shop, a lounge, and the showroom. The fire was stopped before it could damage a new casino addition, which had been in operation for several months and was located north of the main casino. The hotel portion was also unaffected by the fire, and its guests were not evacuated. Most of the affected facilities were expected to be quickly repaired and reopened the next day after the fire. In July 1981, a fire started in a third-floor hotel room and smoke poured through the upper floors, prompting the evacuation of more than 200 guests. The cause of the fire was considered suspicious. =Decline and later years= Revenue declined at the Sahara following the opening of several large resorts nearby, including Caesars Palace in 1966, the International Hotel in 1969, and the MGM Grand in 1973. Many of the Sahara's high rollers started going to Caesars Palace instead. Eugene Moehring, a history professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), said the Sahara \\"helped establish Las Vegas as a major resort city after World War II. But its contributions to Las Vegas shifted as the years went by. By the early 1970s it was getting to be old. One problem is that it just didn't have the money to keep up with the times.\\" Webb died in 1974, leaving the resort under new management through his eponymous company. In 1975, a new, larger keno facility was opened to replace the original. The following year, Del Webb canceled its sponsorship of the Sahara Invitational golf tournament, due to rising costs over the past six years. In the late 1970s, the Sahara was among several casinos involved in a scam pulled off by gamblers. As a result, the Sahara faced a $37,500 fine by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which alleged that the resort had violated casino procedures. A renovation was concluded by 1977. At the end of 1978, Del Webb launched a $50 million expansion project, with Stern as the architect. The project would include the addition of a 27-story hotel tower with 625 rooms. At the time, the Sahara had 953 rooms. The expansion would also increase the casino by nearly double, adding . The expansion was scheduled for completion in 1981. Increased parking space was also part of the project. In 1978, Del Webb purchased 25 acres at the southeast corner of Paradise Road and Sahara Avenue, directly east of the resort, and turned it into a rear parking lot for customers. A pedestrian bridge was also built over Paradise Road, allowing for direct access to the Sahara. The parking lot was once the site of Las Vegas' first airport, Anderson Field, during the 1920s. In 1980, Del Webb had a new sign installed in front of the resort. The sign was created by YESCO and measured approximately 223 feet in height, making it the world's tallest free-standing sign. A new entrance was also added to the resort's south side near Paradise Road, which had become the main exit road from McCarran International Airport. A foundation had been set for the new tower, but construction was halted in 1980, because of financial problems, as Del Webb and the Sahara struggled during the early 1980s recession. Lowden ownership In 1981, Del Webb announced that it would have to sell the Sahara to reduce its debt. Paul W. Lowden, who owned the Hacienda hotel-casino, purchased the 932-room Sahara for $50 million. With the purchase, Lowden owned the southernmost and the northernmost casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. At the time, the Sahara had a casino, as well as 2,500 employees, five of whom had been working there since its opening in 1952. As part of the sale, Del Webb retained the \\"House of Lords\\" restaurant name. In July 1982, following a two-week investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, a Sahara blackjack dealer and seven card players were indicted for taking part in a cheating scheme at the casino. Earlier that month, 50 table game dealers and six supervisors were laid off because of a reduction in business. Lowden finalized his purchase of the resort in August 1982. Table dealers at the Sahara had previously voted to be represented by the Teamsters union, but Del Webb declined to discuss a contract. As Lowden assumed ownership, the dealers considered striking against him to protest the firing of longtime employees. They also wanted contract discussions to take place between Teamsters and Lowden. The dealers failed to get two-thirds support to go on strike. Shortly after taking over, Lowden, a born-again Christian, arranged for the hotel to host a convention of born- again Christians that would include speakers, singers, and teachers. Lowden also planned various improvements for the Sahara, including the hosting of boxing matches. A long-running production show, Bottoms Up, would be removed. Lowden considered the Sahara overstaffed and intended to make the resort more cost-efficient. He also disliked the way some of the employees behaved: \\"I don't like to see the dealers leaning on the tables when no one is playing. There doesn't have to be regimentation, but they will stand up straight. The pit bosses won't be drinking coffee on the job. It's a firm but fair approach.\\" Lowden believed that the resort could no longer attract high rollers, and he instead focused on middle rollers. He also expanded the Sahara Space Center to attract mid-sized conventions and more business meetings. Lowden had the casino expanded to and had columns removed for a spacious appearance. He also moved the hotel lobby to the south entrance, allowing hotel guests to skip walking through the casino. This design had previously been implemented at competitors such as Caesars Palace. Because of interest costs, the Sahara failed to make a profit during the first four years of Lowden's ownership, but room occupancy was up in 1986 as a result of the renovations. In January 1987, Lowden announced the formation of Sahara Casino Partners, a master limited partnership. A portion of the interest in Sahara Casino Partners would be sold through an initial public offering to pay off debt and resume construction of the third hotel tower. Later that year, Sahara Casino Partners became the first casino-based limited partnership to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The partnership raised $51 million, and the debt was paid off later in 1987. The proposed hotel addition would bring the Sahara to 1,500 rooms, helping it compete with other major resorts in Las Vegas. A new sportsbook was opened in early 1988, and the hotel addition, ultimately known as the Tangiers Tower, was completed that September. In 1989, Lowden announced plans for 600 additional rooms, with completion expected the following year, at an expected cost of $30 million. The new rooms were housed in an additional tower attached to the Tangiers Tower. This brought the Sahara up to 2,100 rooms. The Sahara continued to decline in popularity as newer, bigger resorts opened on the Las Vegas Strip, including The Mirage in 1989 and the new MGM Grand in 1993. Lowden ultimately decided to sell the Sahara, saying later, \\"All you had to do was look at The Mirage and say 'How do you compete with that?' The only way is (room) price and you can only do that for so long. We would have had to do something very expensive and we chose not to.\\" The Sahara was also hurt by its location at the north end of the Las Vegas Strip, as newer resorts were opening further south. Bennett ownership In June 1995, Lowden's Sahara Gaming Corporation announced that gaming executive Bill Bennett had agreed to buy the Sahara as part of a $150 million deal. The agreement included the Wet 'n Wild water park located south of the resort. Bennett completed his purchase later that year, at a cost of $193 million. Bennett owned the Sahara through his company, Gordon Gaming Corporation. The opening of the nearby Stratosphere resort in 1996 helped bring revenue back to the northern Las Vegas Strip and the Sahara. Bennett hired Joel Bergman to redesign the Sahara. A $65 million renovation began in March 1996, and was aimed at attracting midlevel gamblers. The original African theme had been largely discarded ever since Del Webb took over ownership, but Bennett restored it. His complete remodel featured a Moroccan theme throughout the resort. The prominent theming was in line with other new resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Part of the renovation would include additional casino space and a new sportsbook. Two new restaurants would also be added, along with a new buffet. The renovation was funded entirely by Bennett and his company. The start of the renovation project was marked by the demolition of the original poolside motel structures, which had housed various celebrities such as Ann-Margret, George Burns, and Tony Bennett. The renovation was scheduled for completion in January 1997, at which point a second phase of remodeling was scheduled to begin. The second phase was intended to add 1,300 rooms, for a total of more than 3,000. Plans for an additional hotel tower were later put on hold in order to evaluate the performance of other new hotel additions in Las Vegas. Ultimately, construction never began on the new tower. As part of the renovation work, the resort's main entrance was relocated from the north side of the property to a new southwest entrance on the Las Vegas Strip. The casino was increased to , with expansion into the southeast area of the property, bringing the gaming closer to the hotel and the newly relocated pool area. Chandeliers were placed throughout the resort. A $4.6 million porte-coch√®re was added, consisting of an expansive overhead Moroccan-style dome, measuring 140 feet high and 200 feet in diameter. Fountains and palm trees surrounded the hotel's circular entryway. A seven-story parking garage with 2,000 spaces was added as well, replacing the 1954 motel addition. The demolition of the Sahara's old motel buildings reduced the room count from 2,100 to approximately 1,800. A new sign, featuring two neon camels, was added along the Las Vegas Strip. A smaller neon camel sign was also added to the rear entrance on Paradise Road. Sahara parking lot and Las Vegas Monorail in 2004 In January 1997, the resort opened its new Sahara Buffet, which had been relocated to the second floor for views of Sahara Avenue and the nearby Stratosphere tower. The new buffet was part of the ongoing renovation work, and it occupied the site previously used for the Sahara Space Center. With 1,154 seats, it was the second largest buffet in Las Vegas, only behind the buffet at the Excalibur Hotel and Casino. On October 10, 1997, the Sahara opened Speedworld, its $15 million race car simulator attraction. It measured and featured 24 vehicles with a television screen built into each one. Bennett enjoyed auto racing, and he had previously helped finance the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The resort's renovation project ultimately cost $100 million. Part of the project included the new Sahara Steak House, which opened in December 1997, as the renovations were nearing completion. Plans were approved in July 1998 for a new Sahara convention center to be built on the parking lot behind the resort. However, these plans were put on hold later that year as there was also a preliminary idea for a parking garage to be built on the land, for the upcoming Las Vegas Monorail. In October 1998, plans were approved for a roller coaster that would be built inside the Sahara, with a height of 100 feet. The following year, the design plans changed so that the roller coaster would be located outside, with a new height of 244 feet. The coaster was part of a planned NASCAR restaurant that would be added to the resort. The original Congo Showroom was demolished in 1999, to make room for the NASCAR Cafe. The showroom was relocated to the second floor. The NASCAR Cafe was housed in a new building constructed at the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue. The restaurant and roller coaster were part of Bennett's $100 million renovation project. The NASCAR Cafe opened on March 2, 2000. The grand opening was attended by 20 NASCAR racers. The NASCAR roller coaster, known as Speed ‚Äì The Ride, opened a month later. The $6 million roller coaster included a 79-foot loop and a 224-foot tower peak. At 70 miles per hour, it was the fastest roller coaster in Las Vegas. It was designed and built by Premier Rides. The Sahara Speedworld was renamed as the Las Vegas Cyber Speedway, and it was included as part of the new NASCAR-themed attraction, which was owned by a company separate from the Sahara. The Sahara received $2 million a year through a lease agreement, as well as 50 percent of the gross revenue. A video game arcade was also added in 2000 along with the NASCAR attraction, and the Sahara Theater was added later that year. At the time, Bennett was still considering the addition of a convention center to the rear parking lot, which was under-used. The Sahara began appealing to middle-class customers under Bennett's ownership, offering dollar specials to stay competitive against newer resorts. UNLV professor Moehring considered the Moroccan and race car themes to be an awkward combination. He stated that Bennett's idea of combining \\"Arabs with NASCAR\\" was a desperate move that ultimately did not work, and that the Sahara mainly attracted low rollers from the 1990s onward. A modest celebration was held in October 2002, marking the resort's 50th anniversary. By that time, the capacity for the Congo Room theater had been reduced from 1,000 people to 850, and dinner was no longer served with the show. Bennett was suffering from an illness at the time, and employees stated that he was micromanaging the resort, having a negative effect on the staff. During 2002, the Sahara had gone through three general managers. Bennett died in December 2002. Following his death, there were no plans to sell the Sahara. Bennett's wife, Lynn, oversaw daily operations from that point forward along with her brother, Al Hummel, who served as the resort's chief executive officer. The steakhouse reopened under the House of Lords name on April 30, 2003. Aerial view of the resort in 2006 In June 2003, Gordon Gaming sought to evict the NASCAR Cafe and owner Dyer Ventures. The attempted eviction was in response to alleged breaches in its lease regarding maintenance. Efram Rosenfeld, an attorney for Dyer Ventures, said, \\"We had an excellent relationship with [Bennett]. The current management has become very hostile. They just want to see if they can grab the money.\\" Rosenfeld believed that the resort wanted to operate the NASCAR attraction on its own to avoid sharing revenue. Gordon Gaming stated that the cafe was not being operated in a way that would maximize its gross sales. Later that month, the two companies resolved the issue, with Dyer agreeing to make improvements to the attraction. Gordon Gaming later purchased the attraction in 2005. The sale included Speed ‚Äì The Ride, the race car simulators, and a NASCAR store. The cafe remained under Dyer's ownership. The opening of the Las Vegas Monorail increased visitation to the Sahara. By February 2006, Hummel had turned down hundreds of offers to purchase the resort, saying that the prospective buyers and the timing never seemed right. By June, the Sahara site was reportedly up for sale. Lynn Bennett died in December 2006, at the age of 64. SBE and Stockbridge In March 2007, Sam Nazarian's SBE Entertainment Group, along with Stockbridge Real Estate Group, agreed to purchase the Sahara from the Bennett family, at a cost of $331.8 million. The purchase would include the Sahara and its 17.45 acres, but not the rear parking lot. Stockbridge would be the majority owner. Nazarian considered the Sahara ideal because of its proximity to the Las Vegas Convention Center, the planned Echelon Place resort, and several new high-rise condominiums. SBE and Stockbridge completed their purchase on August 1, 2007. Under the new ownership, the Sahara's casino portion was operated by Navegante Group. SBE and Stockbridge also filed for their own gaming licenses. Navegante had a one-year lease, and was to operate the casino only until SBE and Stockbridge received their licenses, but Navegante ultimately operated it for the next four years until the resort closed. SBE managed the hotel and restaurants. Nazarian had plans to renovate and redesign the Sahara. In the months after taking ownership, the companies spent $2 million on various upgrades, including new carpeting, seating and wallpaper in the hotel lobby. Hotel employees received new uniforms and the landscaping was also improved. Mini-baccarat was added to attract an Asian clientele, and casino specials were added to lure more local residents to the property. Revenue improved following the changes, and there were plans for a complete renovation of the resort. The companies intended to keep much of the historic hotel intact rather than demolish it, although there was the possibility of a name change. The Clark County Commission approved renovation plans in February 2008. The plans would include the demolition of the original Tunis Tower, the renovation of the two newer high-rise towers, and the addition of a new tower measuring 520 feet in height. The plans were scheduled for completion in 2011, but construction never began due to the Great Recession, which negatively impacted the Sahara and the northern Las Vegas Strip. In 2008, the Sahara designated a portion of its casino space as \\"Locals Lane,\\" part of an effort to appeal to local residents. Slot machines in this area gave higher payouts, and a separate slot club redemption center was also set up for locals. In addition, the slot club provided such customers with discounts on hotel rooms, restaurants, and shows. In 2009, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Sahara employee who said he was repeatedly harassed because of his Egyptian heritage. Gordon Gaming, SBE and Stockbridge subsequently agreed to pay a total of $100,000 to settle the lawsuit. In December 2009, the Sahara closed its buffet and two of its hotel towers due to weak demand during the holiday season. The Tangiers Tower remained open. In 2010, Nazarian was in negotiations with lenders to restructure the Sahara's debt, ultimately reaching a forbearance agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland Group, the primary lender. =Closure= On March 11, 2011, it was announced that the Sahara would close in two months. At the time, the Sahara had 1,720 hotel rooms and of casino space, and offered the only $1 blackjack on the Las Vegas Strip. The resort featured two primary restaurants at the time: House of Lords steakhouse, and the NASCAR Cafe. The Sahara had 1,050 employees who would be affected by the closure. SBE intended to help find new jobs for Sahara employees at MGM Resorts' properties. Hotel customers with reservations following the planned closing date would also be transferred to MGM Resorts' properties. At the time of the closing announcement, Nazarian, the CEO of SBE, said, \\"We are working with our partners to assess a variety of options for the property, including a complete renovation and repositioning. While no final decisions have been made at this point, the continued operation of the aging Sahara was no longer economically viable.\\" Jerry Lewis, once a performer at the Sahara, said, \\"We are losing what was considered by most of us Las Vegans as one of the trademarks of the city.\\" Lowden said he was not saddened by the closure: \\"I like progress. I like change. It's fun to look back, but this might be a chance for the Sahara to move forward.\\" Speed ‚Äì The Ride closed on May 1, 2011. It was later sold and removed.https://www.vegasbright.com/2017/01/24/speed-the-ride-sits-in-the-sun/ The sports book and Sahara Theater closed later in May 2011. The resort's hotel and casino closed at 2:00 p.m. on May 16, 2011, marking the end of the Sahara's 58-year operation. National Content Liquidators began a two-month liquidation sale at the Sahara in June 2011, with more than 600,000 items available for sale on the first day. The contents of the NASCAR Cafe were initially excluded from the sale, although an auction was later held for 2,000 items from the restaurant. The sale of the resort items concluded in September 2011, and it attracted thousands of people over the course of its run. It was the largest liquidation sale in Las Vegas history. Items that did not sell were donated. The camel sign at the rear entrance was donated to the city's Neon Museum. =SLS Las Vegas= In September 2011, plans to redevelop the Sahara were accelerated, as SBE and Stockbridge announced the purchase of the resort's mortgage debt. Gensler was hired as the architectural design firm, while Penta Building Group would serve as the general contractor. Philippe Starck would handle the interior design. Starck was a longtime partner of Nazarian, and his design plans for the Sahara dated to 2007. Later in 2011, the Clark County Commission approved renovation plans for the resort. The Sahara would be renamed as SLS Las Vegas, part of SBE's growing chain of SLS- branded hotels in the United States. The name \\"SLS\\" stood for style, luxury, and service. Nazarian planned to remodel the Sahara into a luxurious boutique hotel, matching his other properties. The Las Vegas location would include restaurant and nightlife brands affiliated with SBE, and would provide a Beverly Hills experience. The room count would be reduced from 1,720 to 1,622 as a result of the renovations. The plans would also include the demolition of Speed ‚Äì The Ride. The SLS Las Vegas would oversee all amenities, unlike other casinos which would lease such space to third-party operators. Nazarian hoped to have SLS Las Vegas opened in the second quarter of 2014, and he needed to raise $415 million from investors and lenders to convert the Sahara into the new resort. The project was expected to cost a total of $744 million, with SBE and Stockbridge contributing $329 million. The project's financing plan would include investors through the EB-5 program. Moody's and Standard & Poor's considered the project risky because of its location, and they questioned the owners' ability to pay off future debt. In April 2012, the project secured $300 million in funding through JPMorgan Chase. Nazarian said the Sahara hotel towers would be \\"stripped down to their skeletons\\" to allow for renovation work. SBE was known for redeveloping old hotels into new ones rather than demolishing them. Nazarian said, \\"Instead of exploding an Old Vegas landmark like everybody else does, I am reusing the bones to build something new. I'm making it smaller and more personal, though, so the experience is more manicured. Bigger isn't better.\\" Retaining the hotel buildings would allow the SLS to offer low room rates. Groundbreaking for the SLS Las Vegas project took place on February 13, 2013, after the EB-5 program provided the remainder of the $415 million needed to renovate the Sahara. Senator Harry Reid, the U.S. Senate Majority Leader, later received criticism for using his power to expedite the EB-5 process for Asian investors in the SLS. Reid defended his action, stating that the project otherwise could have lost funding, resulting in the loss of future jobs. The EB-5 financing came from 800 Chinese investors. A three-month demolition phase was underway in March 2013, with much of the interior gutted. The Sahara's camel sign on the Las Vegas Strip was dismantled, followed by the removal of the Moroccan-style dome. In early 2014, it was announced that the SLS Las Vegas would open later that year on August 29, during the Labor Day weekend. In June 2014, it was announced that the SLS would be part of Hilton's Curio brand, which allowed customers to use and earn points at select hotels. The SLS was also part of the Preferred Hotels & Resorts guest loyalty program, increasing the potential for a customer base. SBE also had a loyalty program of its own with more than five million customers in its database, with an average age of 38 years. Many of those customers lived in southern California. Construction progressed ahead of schedule, prompting a new opening date of August 23, 2014. A $5.2 million marketing campaign was launched to promote the opening. The campaign honored the original Sahara through photographs taken during the 1960s, alongside modern images of the SLS. Historical photos were also featured inside the SLS. Carpeting throughout the resort featured the images of celebrities who had performed at the Sahara over the years, including Dean Martin. Approximately 50 S-shaped Sahara door handles were turned into a chandelier for the SLS. Stockbridge received state approval to operate the casino two days prior to the scheduled opening. Stockbridge would operate it through a subsidiary known as SB Gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission requested that Nazarian and SBE not have any involvement in the casino operation until his license investigation was concluded, a process that was expected to take up to five months. Nazarian and SBE would manage all other areas of the SLS. Stockbridge owned 90 percent of the resort, while SBE owned the remainder. Opening SLS Las Vegas and Sam by Starck statue SLS Las Vegas hosted a VIP party on the night of August 22, 2014, ahead of the public opening at midnight. The VIP party hosted 3,600 guests, including various celebrities. Thousands of local residents arrived for the midnight opening, which was celebrated with performances by Iggy Azalea, Rita Ora, and Lenny Kravitz. A fireworks display also marked the celebration. It was the first new resort to open on the Las Vegas Strip since the Cosmopolitan in 2010. The SLS employed 3,400 people, including nearly 100 former Sahara employees. The SLS Las Vegas was SBE's flagship property with 1,620 rooms, the most of any of its hotel properties. The SLS featured a chic and modern design. The target demographic consisted of residents from southern California, as well as younger people. The resort had a focus on offering amenity brands that were popular in Los Angeles, where Nazarian owned several businesses such as nightclubs. The SLS also sought to attract between 35 and 40 percent of its business through local residents, a demographic that generally did not venture to the Las Vegas Strip. Restaurants and nightclubs were priced low to attract locals, and resort entrances were situated to allow locals to easily access the eateries. The SLS would also appeal to local residents through gaming and restaurant promotions. The Sahara's original entrance for the Las Vegas Monorail was demolished and rebuilt for easier access from the casino. The resort also took advantage of its proximity to the Las Vegas Convention Center by offering convention guests with discounts on the monorail. Little remained of the earlier Sahara resort, aside from the exterior shell of its buildings. The Sahara hotel towers were renamed as the Lux, Story, and World towers, catering respectively to luxury travelers, younger people, and tourists. Kravitz designed four suites for the SLS, and the former Alexandria Tower was turned into an all-suite building. The World tower was the largest, with 1,100 rooms. The rooms in the Story tower featured a basic design with gray walls and exposed concrete ceilings. Nazarian's plans made the resort more spacious and provided easier access to the hotel towers and the conference center. The Sahara's Congo Room was renamed as the Congo Ballroom. A portion of the former NASCAR Cafe was turned into space for gambling, nightclubs, and the Bazaar Meat steakhouse. Along the Las Vegas Strip, an indoor-outdoor patio area was added to serve as a beer garden, taking the place where Speed ‚Äì The Ride once operated. Nazarian had the casino floor redesigned for a darker appearance resembling a nightclub, with a high ceiling and exposed ductwork. Part of the casino featured floor tiles that changed colors. The casino measured and included 790 slot machines, as well as 74 table games. The casino was small compared to others on the Las Vegas Strip. In contrast to the Sahara casino, the number of slot machines in the SLS was reduced to allow more table games. The updated SLS floor plan had gaming throughout the property, including table games in one of the nightclubs and in a restaurant's lounge area. The casino also included a sports book operated by William Hill. Prior to its opening, observers were concerned that the SLS did not have enough of a focus on its casino portion. The Cosmopolitan, also a modern resort with a limited focus on gaming, had lost money since its opening in 2010. However, gaming was no longer a primary source of revenue for most casino resorts in Las Vegas. As the opening approached, analysts believed the SLS would perform better than the Cosmopolitan. The SLS opened with nine restaurants, many of which were popular in Los Angeles. Jos√© Andr√©s had two restaurants at the resort, including Bazaar Meat. Andr√©s had been a partner of SBE for six years. The resort also included an Umami Burger, the SLS Buffet, the Griddle Cafe, and a Mediterranean restaurant known as Cleo. The SLS had three nightclubs: Foxtail, Life, and Sayers Club. Foxtail had an interior space. It also featured a exterior area known as Foxtail Pool Club, open during certain times of the year. Foxtail Pool Club parties included 3D images projected onto the wall of the resort's parking garage. Life measured , and took the space formerly occupied by the Sahara Theater. Life had capacity for 1,800 people, and included three bars, 70 VIP tables, DJ music, and a rooftop pool smaller than the one at Foxtail. The Sayers Club originated in Hollywood in 2011, and the SLS Las Vegas marked its second location. The club measured and included capacity for 168 people. It doubled as a live music venue. A restaurant near the casino Clothing retailer Fred Segal operated seven stores throughout the SLS, each offering different merchandise and taking up a total of . Fred Segal was a well known retailer in the Los Angeles area and was added to SLS Las Vegas to provide southern California tourists with familiarity. It marked the first time that Fred Segal opened a location outside of southern California. A 32-foot-tall abstract statue, known as Sam by Starck, was designed by Starck and placed in front of the SLS, as a homage to Nazarian. The statue, resembling a silver starfish, was compared by some observers to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and the Pillsbury Doughboy. The statue, which used an internal steel frame, was constructed on-site and in pieces. A 12-foot metal duck statue, also by Starck, was added to the hotel's pool area. The duck statue was filled with Styrofoam and was glued in place. The opening of the SLS was considered a positive step for the north Las Vegas Strip following the Great Recession. The resort soon became a popular hangout for celebrities. Changes The SLS opening was followed by the winter season, typically a weaker business period for Las Vegas resorts. The SLS experienced various hardships during its first year. In October 2014, the SLS laid off less than two percent of its workers. A reduction in staffing was common for Las Vegas Strip casinos shortly after opening, as business is difficult to predict prior to that point. The number of layoffs was low for a Las Vegas resort. Rob Oseland, the president of SLS Las Vegas, announced later that month that he would depart the property to work on a new project. Such departures are also common following a resort opening. He was replaced by Scott Kreeger, a former executive for MGM Resorts and Station Casinos. The buffet did not perform as hoped, due to its location on the second floor. It was temporarily closed for the season in November 2014, with an expected reopening the next year. In December 2014, during a hearing with the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Nazarian admitted to drug use earlier in the year. The board had concerns about this and also questioned Nazarian's handling of an extortionist who received money from Nazarian to leave him alone. The board was concerned that Nazarian could be easily manipulated, but ultimately recommended him for a limited gaming license. Later that month, Nazarian and Stockbridge came to a mutual agreement that he step back from all daily operations at the SLS. Nazarian said he wanted to focus on other SBE brands, while SBE would continue to operate the non-gaming areas of the SLS. Although Nazarian was no longer involved in operations, state law still required that he be licensed, as he owned more than five percent of the resort. A few days after Nazarian's departure, the Nevada Gaming Commission held a hearing in regard to his licensing. Although the commission intended to deny him, Nazarian apologized for his past actions and convinced the commission to grant him a one-year limited gaming license. Because of the prior concerns regarding Nazarian, there were several conditions relating to his license, including random drug testing and no involvement in casino operations. Although the Griddle Cafe was popular among customers, its owner chose to close it in January 2015, to focus on new locations. The restaurant was renamed as Northside Cafe the following month. At the time, there were no plans to reopen the buffet, and the Foxtail club had seen poor revenue. In addition, Dean Martin's family had requested a $50,000 licensing fee for using his image on the resort's carpeting. The family stated that the image infringed on Martin's right of publicity, and legal action was threatened if the SLS did not either remove the carpet image or pay the fee. The SLS filed a lawsuit against Martin's family and sought a declaratory judgment that the carpeting was not infringement. In May 2015, the Teamsters union picketed for several days outside the SLS, alleging that the resort refused to let its valet parkers form a union. The SLS experienced revenue losses during the first half of 2015. Walk-in traffic was poor due to the resort's location, surrounded by unbuilt projects. The SLS was also half a mile away from its nearest rival resorts, further contributing to a lack of walk-in business. However, the monorail helped increase customer numbers. Kreeger estimated that a complete turnaround at the resort could take 18 to 24 months as adjustments were made. In response to the losses, there were plans to turn the Life nightclub into a live music venue with a third-party operator to manage it. The casino's loyalty club was revamped in a further effort to attract locals, and Kreeger wanted to double the resort's convention space. There was consideration given to turning the closed buffet into additional meeting space. Two SLS restaurants were sold to restaurant operator One Group in July 2015, although SBE continued to manage them. The following month, Fred Segal closed its stores at the SLS, and the resort opened three of its own retailers as a replacement. Kreeger said that local customers were not interested in the high-priced clothing at the Fred Segal stores, and tourists from southern California already have such stores to shop at, leading to the closure of the SLS locations. The SLS continued to suffer financially. Sign for SLS and W Las Vegas In October 2015, it was announced that Nazarian would sell his 10-percent interest to Stockbridge, which would pay a licensing fee to SBE to continue using the SLS name. Stockbridge stated that the deal would be more cost-efficient and would give greater flexibility to open new restaurants at the resort. Nazarian also considered the deal beneficial. The acquisition was approved by the state in November 2015, and Stockbridge ended its affiliation with Hilton and its Curio collection. That month, Stockbridge announced a partnership with Starwood, which would take over the 289-room Lux tower and reopen it in 2016 under the name W Las Vegas. Starwood's W chain was considered a luxury brand, and the new project was expected to increase revenue by attracting a more upscale demographic. In addition, the two SLS towers would be added to Starwood's Tribute Portfolio, a chain of independent four-star hotels that would allow it to take advantage of Starwood's reservation platform and member benefits. Both companies would finance the W Las Vegas project, while the other two towers would remain part of the SLS Las Vegas. Starwood would operate the W Las Vegas, while Stockbridge would continue managing the SLS. It would mark the first W hotel in Las Vegas after several previous attempts to build one, including a failed project near the Las Vegas Strip. The Life nightclub reopened as a live music venue, The Foundry, in February 2016. The Foundry had capacity for 1,800 standing guests, or seating for 600. Musical acts were handled by Live Nation Entertainment. The Sayers Club had begun offering comedy acts, which were also offered at The Foundry in addition to its musical performances. W Las Vegas had been scheduled to open in September 2016, but this was delayed when Starwood was acquired by Marriott International that month. W Las Vegas ultimately opened on December 1, 2016, becoming the city's latest hotel-within-a-hotel after others such as Delano Las Vegas. It included its own entrance at the rear of the SLS. It also featured a W-branded spa, and a three-floor building with of event and meeting space. The three-story building was a new addition. A 13,500-pound neon \\"W\\" letter was added atop the SLS sign on the Las Vegas Strip. Kreeger resigned as SLS Las Vegas president at the end of 2016, to work for another company. Several weeks later, Terry Downey was named as the new president and chief operating officer, while Robert Schaffhauser was named as chief financial officer. They had previously worked as executives for the Aliante hotel-casino in North Las Vegas. Downey and Schaffhauser subsequently hired 13 executives from the Aliante for new positions at the SLS. Sale to Meruelo SLS at night, 2017 In May 2017, it was announced that Reno businessman Alex Meruelo and his company, Meruelo Group, would purchase the SLS Las Vegas from Stockbridge. The sale was initially expected to be finalized later that year, although continued price negotiations between Meruelo and Stockbridge pushed back the completion of the purchase. Following the announcement of the sale, the SLS renamed its rewards program from \\"The Code\\" to \\"Club 52\\", referencing the resort's initial opening in 1952. The \\"SLS\\" name was not popular among gamblers, and there were rumors that the resort would revert to its \\"Sahara\\" name once Meruelo took over ownership. At the time, the casino measured , excluding an sports book. Downey and Schaffhauser stepped down from their positions in July 2017. Such departures were common during an ownership transition. At the end of 2017, a lawsuit was filed by 60 Chinese residents who had invested in the SLS through the EB-5 program. The suit was filed against Stockbridge, SBE, and Meruelo. The investors had yet to receive a green card through the program, and they alleged that the resort had never made a profit. They sought $255 million in damages and other costs, and stated that Meruelo's purchase would nullify their chances at getting a green card. Meruelo negotiated with the investors regarding their loan money, which was due back in 2018 and 2019. The dispute further delayed the sale to Meruelo. In February 2018, the Culinary Workers Union was in a labor dispute with Meruelo regarding his employees at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada. The union subsequently called for a state investigation into Meruelo's impending purchase of the SLS Las Vegas, citing concerns about his suitability to own and operate the resort. The union also cited objections from the EB-5 investors regarding the proposed sale. Meruelo Group completed its purchase of the SLS in April 2018. At the time, the SLS employed 1,800 people. Alex Meruelo had plans for a $100 million renovation of the resort, and he was also expected to rebrand it in 2019. Observers speculated that the resort would revive the Sahara name, and renovation plans used a \\"working name\\" of \\"Grand Sahara Resort\\", mirroring the Grand Sierra Resort. Paul Hobson was hired as general manager and would oversee the renovations. Meruelo considered the Hispanic clientele in Las Vegas underserved, and stated that it would be among the target demographics for the resort under his ownership. Meruelo owned two television and three radio stations in California, which he would use to promote the SLS. In August 2018, the SLS ended its relationship with Starwood, and the W Las Vegas was renamed as the Grand Tower and brought back under in-house management, as part of Meruelo's plans for the resort. At the time, the SLS had a total of 1,616 rooms. Meruelo's $100 million renovation began in October 2018, and included upgrades to the hotel's rooms, hallways, and lobby. Meruelo had the casino floor brightened, as he considered it too dark. The Story tower was updated to remove its basic design in favor of a more conventional appearance, as most guests did not like the earlier design. Meruelo's construction firm handled the upgrades. The SLS became profitable near the end of 2018, and there was optimism that the resort would continue to improve in the coming years with the scheduled resort openings of The Drew and Resorts World, as well as an expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center. =Return to Sahara= Meruelo held an enormous ceremony involving fireworks and a light show on June 27, 2019 to announce an upcoming name change to Sahara Las Vegas, as part of the ongoing renovation. The resort would continue to operate under the SLS name for several months until the Sahara name was fully implemented throughout the resort. The process to replace the SLS branding, including exterior signage, was expected to conclude in September or October 2019, at which point the resort would be marketed under the Sahara name. On the night of August 27, 2019, the Sam by Starck statue was removed during a ceremony and subsequently disposed, as part of the Sahara rebranding. The ceremony began with flames that were set off at the base of the statue, followed by a fireworks show. A crane subsequently tore the statue down. Palm trees are expected to take the place of the former statue. Because of the way that the statue was constructed, a company spokesman stated that it would be nearly impossible to disassemble the statue and restore it elsewhere for display. The pool area's duck statue is expected to be relocated to the pool at the Grand Sierra Resort. The resort became Sahara Las Vegas on August 29, 2019, and renovations were expected to continue into 2020. A renovation of the pool area was scheduled to begin in September 2019. The Sahara's new lounge was named Casbar Lounge, after the resort's original live-music venue. The new Sahara is modern in its design and does not feature a Moroccan theme as before, although it features references to the original Sahara. Hobson said, \\"You might see some camels in artwork around the property, but nothing in terms of a theme. There will be reference to the original Sahara era that reflects what we want for the modern era. There's some nostalgia, but we are defining it for today.\\" A few months after its opening, the Sahara Las Vegas sought donations of old memorabilia from the original Sahara for display in the resort. A poker room opened in February 2020, as part of the renovation project. Poker had been absent from the casino for nearly a decade, and many Las Vegas casinos had shut their poker rooms in recent years due to a decline in popularity. Sahara executives intended to use the resort's restaurant space and pool decks to host meetings and conventions, recapturing a demographic that was largely ignored when the resort operated as SLS Las Vegas. Entertainers Marlene Dietrich performing at the Sahara. Numerous performers have entertained at the resort over the years, including Buddy Hackett, Liberace, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, George Burns, and Sammy Davis Jr. Other performers included Bobby Darin, Red Skelton, Ann Blyth, Martha Raye, Donald O'Connor, Kathryn Grayson, Mae West, Jack Benny, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Ann-Margret, George Carlin, Tina Turner, and drag queen Kenny Kerr. In 1952, Sahara owner Milton Prell booked transgender woman Christine Jorgensen to sing at the Sahara, without hearing her first. Prell learned prior to her two-week gig that she could not sing well, and he canceled her performances by claiming that he did not know about her transgender status. Bill Miller, the resort's entertainment director at the time, sent a letter to Jorgensen reading, \\"I'm not going to pull a farce on my customers. I won't give them a man dressed in women's clothing. I bought a 'she.'\\" In 1953, after Jorgensen gave a performance in Pittsburgh that was positively reviewed, Prell signed her back up for a two- week gig at the Sahara, which proved to be a success. In 1953, singer Marlene Dietrich was paid $90,000 to give performances for three weeks at the Sahara. A $200,000 contract was later announced that would have Dietrich perform in two separate engagements at the hotel, each spanning four weeks. The Sahara subsequently took credit for pioneering the concept of high-priced acts, citing Dietrich's initial performances there in 1953. In late 1954, Miller hired jazz musician Louis Prima to be their late night lounge act, one of the earliest ones on the Las Vegas Strip. Along with his then-wife Keely Smith and sax player Sam Butera, they created one of the most popular late-night attractions on the Strip. In 1956, Abbott and Costello appeared together for the last time on the Sahara stage before their permanent breakup. Don Rickles was a regular performer at the Sahara and launched his Las Vegas career there in 1959. In 1961, Eleanor Powell came out of retirement after 14 years to star in a musical revue at the Sahara. Judy Garland performed at the resort in 1962, and Johnny Carson regularly appeared at the Sahara's Congo Room from 1962 to 1974. In 1965, Milton Berle starred in a comedy show at the Sahara known as Never Too Late. Several live albums were recorded at the Sahara, including Live from Las Vegas by Prima and Smith, Live at the Sahara: Las Vegas, 1964 by Tony Bennett, Live at The Sahara in Las Vegas by Connie Francis, and Live in Las Vegas Vol. 2 by Sonny & Cher. The resort was the site of the annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon for many years, first from 1973 to 1981 and again from 1991 to 1994. Jerry Lewis himself also performed at the resort. The Sahara Space Center hosted events such as boxing matches, and the Jerry Lewis telethon. It also hosted the bands Kiss and Rush in 1975. In early 2000, The Amazing Johnathan hosted a magic act at the Sahara during a five- week period. Shortly thereafter, the hotel launched a Rat Pack tribute show known as The Rat Pack is Back. Later in 2000, Steve Wyrick began hosting a magic show at the Sahara Theater. Resort owner Bill Bennett gave Wyrick full control over the design of the new theater, which had seating for 860 people. Charo, who made her headliner debut at the Sahara two decades earlier, started a concert show at the resort in 2002. The following year, the Sahara launched \\"World's Greatest Magic Show\\", a variety style show featuring eight to ten magicians, each performing their best trick. The Amazing Johnathan opened another magic show at the Sahara in 2005. He left two years later to focus on television production, and was replaced by comedian Roseanne Barr. The Scintas performed at the Sahara for a year, before departing in 2007. In 2008, the Sahara launched a dance show called Raw Talent Live, focusing on the relationship between humans and technology. In 2009, The Comedy Stop relocated from the Tropicana resort to the Sahara, offering a rotating lineup of comedians. During the same year, the Sahara debuted an act by magician Rick Thomas, and a new Rat Pack tribute show by Sandy Hackett. Blanc de Blanc, a cabaret-style variety show, debuted at The Foundry in August 2019, and ended in November after a poor financial performance. Another show, Magic Mike Live, is scheduled to open in 2020.

Modern scholarship identifies three major stages in monumental sculpture in bronze and stone: the Archaic (from about 650 to 480 BC), Classical (480-323) and Hellenistic. At all periods there were great numbers of Greek terracotta figurines and small sculptures in metal and other materials. The Greeks decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour.Cook, 19 Seeing their gods as having human form, there was little distinction between the sacred and the secular in art‚Äîthe human body was both secular and sacred. A male nude of Apollo or Heracles had only slight differences in treatment to one of that year's Olympic boxing champion. The statue, originally single but by the Hellenistic period often in groups was the dominant form, though reliefs, often so \\"high\\" that they were almost free-standing, were also important. Materials Natural marble By the classical period, roughly the 5th and 4th centuries, monumental sculpture was composed almost entirely of marble or bronze; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century; many pieces of sculpture known only in marble copies made for the Roman market were originally made in bronze. Smaller works were in a great variety of materials, many of them precious, with a very large production of terracotta figurines. The territories of ancient Greece, except for Sicily and southern Italy, contained abundant supplies of fine marble, with Pentelic and Parian marble the most highly prized. The ores for bronze were also relatively easy to obtain.Cook, 74-75 Athena in the workshop of a sculptor working on a marble horse, Attic red-figure kylix, 480 BC, Staatliche Antikensammlungen (Inv. 2650) Both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable; as in most ancient cultures there were no doubt also traditions of sculpture in wood about which we know very little, other than acrolithic sculptures, usually large, with the head and exposed flesh parts in marble but the clothed parts in wood. As bronze always had a significant scrap value very few original bronzes have survived, though in recent years marine archaeology or trawling has added a few spectacular finds, such as the Artemision Bronze and Riace bronzes, which have significantly extended modern understanding. Many copies of the Roman period are marble versions of works originally in bronze. Ordinary limestone was used in the Archaic period, but thereafter, except in areas of modern Italy with no local marble, only for architectural sculpture and decoration. Plaster or stucco was sometimes used for the hair only.Cook, 74-76 Chryselephantine sculptures, used for temple cult images and luxury works, used gold, most often in leaf form and ivory for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived. Many statues were given jewellery, as can be seen from the holes for attaching it, and held weapons or other objects in different materials.Cook, 75-76 The Victorious Youth (c. 310 BC), a remarkably weather-preserved bronze statue of a Greek athlete in Contrapposto pose Painting of sculpture Despite appearing white today, Greek sculptures were originally painted. This color restoration shows what a statue of a Trojan archer from the Temple of Aphaia, Aegina would have originally looked like. Ancient Greek sculptures were originally painted bright colors; they only appear white today because the original pigments have deteriorated. References to painted sculptures are found throughout classical literature, including in Euripides's Helen in which the eponymous character laments, \\"If only I could shed my beauty and assume an uglier aspect/The way you would wipe color off a statue.\\" Some well-preserved statues still bear traces of their original coloration and archaeologists can reconstruct what they would have originally looked like. By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces, some of which were still visible. Despite this, influential art historians such as Johann Joachim Winckelmann so strongly opposed the idea of painted Greek sculpture that proponents of painted statues were dismissed as eccentrics, and their views were largely dismissed for more than a century. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann in the late 20th and early 21st century that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact. Using high-intensity lamps, ultraviolet light, specially designed cameras, plaster casts, and certain powdered minerals, Brinkmann proved that the entire Parthenon, including the actual structure as well as the statues, had been painted. He analyzed the pigments of the original paint to discover their composition. Brinkmann made several painted replicas of Greek statues that went on tour around the world. Also in the collection were replicas of other works of Greek and Roman sculpture, and he demonstrated that the practice of painting sculpture was the norm rather than the exception in Greek and Roman art. Museums that hosted the exhibit included the Glyptothek Museum in Munich, the Vatican Museum, and the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, et al. The collection made its American debut at Harvard University in the Fall of 2007.October 2007, Colorizing classic statues returns them to antiquity: What was really on that Grecian Urn? Harvard University Gazette. Brinkmann said that \\"no other aspect of the art of antiquity is as little understood as is the polychrome painting of temples and sculptures\\", and that modern sculptures, ostensibly inspired by the Greeks but left unpainted, are \\"something entirely new\\". Development of Greek sculptures =Geometric= It is commonly thought that the earliest incarnation of Greek sculpture was in the form of wooden cult statues, first described by Pausanias as xoana.The term xoanon and the ascriptions are both highly problematic. A.A. Donohue's Xoana and the origins of Greek sculpture, 1988, details how the term had a variety of meanings in the ancient world not necessarily to do with the cult objects No such statues survive, and the descriptions of them are vague, despite the fact that they were probably objects of veneration for hundreds of years. The first piece of Greek statuary to be reassembled since is probably the Lefkandi Centaur, a terra cotta sculpture found on the island of Euboea, dated c. 920 BC. The statue was constructed in parts, before being dismembered and buried in two separate graves. The centaur has an intentional mark on its knee, which has led researchers to postulate that the statue might portray Cheiron, presumably kneeling wounded from Herakles' arrow. If so, it would be the earliest known depiction of myth in the history of Greek sculpture. The forms from the geometrical period (c. 900 to c. 700 BC) were chiefly terra cotta figurines, bronzes, and ivories. The bronzes are chiefly tripod cauldrons, and freestanding figures or groups. Such bronzes were made using the lost-wax technique probably introduced from Syria, and are almost entirely votive offerings left at the Hellenistic civilization Panhellenic sanctuaries of Olympia, Delos, and Delphi, though these were likely manufactured elsewhere, as a number of local styles may be identified by finds from Athens, Argos, and Sparta. Typical works of the era include the Karditsa warrior (Athens Br. 12831) and the many examples of the equestrian statuette (for example, NY Met. 21.88.24 online). The repertory of this bronze work is not confined to standing men and horses, however, as vase paintings of the time also depict imagery of stags, birds, beetles, hares, griffins and lions. There are no inscriptions on early-to-middle geometric sculpture, until the appearance of the Mantiklos \\"Apollo\\" (Boston 03.997) of the early 7th century BC found in Thebes. The figure is that of a standing man with a pseudo- daedalic form, underneath which lies the hexameter inscription reading \\"Mantiklos offered me as a tithe to Apollo of the silver bow; do you, Phoibos [Apollo], give some pleasing favour in return\\".ŒúŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫ŒªŒøœÇ Œº' Œ±ŒΩŒµŒ∏ŒµŒ∫Œµ œùŒµŒ∫Œ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒøŒπ Œ±œÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒøœÑŒøœáœÉŒøŒπ œÑŒ±œÇ {Œ¥}Œ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÇ¬∑ œÑœÖ Œ¥Œµ Œ¶ŒøŒπŒ≤Œµ Œ¥ŒπŒ¥ŒøŒπ œáŒ±œÅŒπœùŒµœÑœÑŒ±ŒΩ Œ±ŒºŒøŒπœù[Œ±ŒΩ],\\" transliterated as \\"Mantiklos m‚Äô anetheke wekaboloi argyrotokhsoi tas dekatas; tu de Phoibe didoi khariwettan amoiw[an]\\" Apart from the novelty of recording its own purpose, this sculpture adapts the formulae of oriental bronzes, as seen in the shorter more triangular face and slightly advancing left leg. This is sometimes seen as anticipating the greater expressive freedom of the 7th century BC and, as such, the Mantiklos figure is referred to in some quarters as proto-Daedalic. =Archaic= Kleobis and Biton, kouroi of the Archaic period, c. 580 BC. Delphi Archaeological Museum. Inspired by the monumental stone sculpture of ancient EgyptThe debt of archaic Greek sculpture to Egyptian canons was recognized in Antiquity: see Diodorus Siculus, i.98.5-9. and Mesopotamia, the Greeks began again to carve in stone. Free-standing figures share the solidity and frontal stance characteristic of Eastern models, but their forms are more dynamic than those of Egyptian sculpture, as for example the Lady of Auxerre and Torso of Hera (Early Archaic period, c. 660‚Äì580 BC, both in the Louvre, Paris). After about 575 BC, figures such as these, both male and female, began wearing the so-called archaic smile. This expression, which has no specific appropriateness to the person or situation depicted, may have been a device to give the figures a distinctive human characteristic. Three types of figures prevailed‚Äîthe standing nude male youth (kouros, plural kouroi), the standing draped girl (kore, plural korai), and the seated woman. All emphasize and generalize the essential features of the human figure and show an increasingly accurate comprehension of human anatomy. The youths were either sepulchral or votive statues. Examples are Apollo (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an early work; the Strangford Apollo from Anafi (British Museum, London), a much later work; and the Anavyssos Kouros (National Archaeological Museum of Athens). More of the musculature and skeletal structure is visible in this statue than in earlier works. The standing, draped girls have a wide range of expression, as in the sculptures in the Acropolis Museum of Athens. Their drapery is carved and painted with the delicacy and meticulousness common in the details of sculpture of this period. The Greeks thus decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour. Seeing their gods as having human form, there was no distinction between the sacred and the secular in art‚Äîthe human body was both secular and sacred. A male nude without any attachments such as a bow or a club, could just as easily be Apollo or Heracles as that year's Olympic boxing champion. In the Archaic Period the most important sculptural form was the kouros (plural kouroi), the standing male nude (See for example Biton and Kleobis). The kore (plural korai), or standing clothed female figure, was also common; Greek art did not present female nudity (unless the intention was pornographic) until the 4th century BC, although the development of techniques to represent drapery is obviously important. As with pottery, the Greeks did not produce sculpture merely for artistic display. Statues were commissioned either by aristocratic individuals or by the state, and used for public memorials, as offerings to temples, oracles and sanctuaries (as is frequently shown by inscriptions on the statues), or as markers for graves. Statues in the Archaic period were not all intended to represent specific individuals. They were depictions of an ideal‚Äîbeauty, piety, honor or sacrifice. These were always depictions of young men, ranging in age from adolescence to early maturity, even when placed on the graves of (presumably) elderly citizens. Kouroi were all stylistically similar. Graduations in the social stature of the person commissioning the statue were indicated by size rather than artistic innovations.

Found by fishermen off the coast of Cape Artemisium in 1928. The figure is more than 2 m in height. The Classical period saw a revolution of Greek sculpture, sometimes associated by historians with the popular culture surrounding the introduction of democracy and the end of the aristocratic culture associated with the kouroi. The Classical period saw changes in the style and function of sculpture, along with a dramatic increase in the technical skill of Greek sculptors in depicting realistic human forms. Poses also became more naturalistic, notably during the beginning of the period. This is embodied in works such as the Kritios Boy (480 BC), sculpted with the earliest known use of contrapposto ('counterpose'), and the Charioteer of Delphi (474 BC), which demonstrates a transition to more naturalistic sculpture. From about 500 BC, Greek statues began increasingly to depict real people, as opposed to vague interpretations of myth or entirely fictional votive statues, although the style in which they were represented had not yet developed into a realistic form of portraiture. The statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, set up in Athens mark the overthrow of the aristocratic tyranny, and have been said to be the first public monuments to show actual individuals. The Classical Period also saw an increase in the use of statues and sculptures as decorations of buildings. The characteristic temples of the Classical era, such as the Parthenon in Athens, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, used relief sculpture for decorative friezes, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the pediments. The difficult aesthetic and technical challenge stimulated much in the way of sculptural innovation. Most of these works survive only in fragments, for example the Parthenon Marbles, roughly half of which are in the British Museum. Funeral statuary evolved during this period from the rigid and impersonal kouros of the Archaic period to the highly personal family groups of the Classical period. These monuments are commonly found in the suburbs of Athens, which in ancient times were cemeteries on the outskirts of the city. Although some of them depict \\"ideal\\" types‚Äîthe mourning mother, the dutiful son‚Äîthey increasingly depicted real people, typically showing the departed taking his dignified leave from his family. This is a notable increase in the level of emotion relative to the Archaic and Geometrical eras. Another notable change is the burgeoning of artistic credit in sculpture. The entirety of information known about sculpture in the Archaic and Geometrical periods are centered upon the works themselves, and seldom, if ever, on the sculptors. Examples include Phidias, known to have overseen the design and building of the Parthenon, and Praxiteles, whose nude female sculptures were the first to be considered artistically respectable. Praxiteles' Aphrodite of Knidos, which survives in copies, was often referenced to and praised by Pliny the Elder. Lysistratus is said to have been the first to use plaster molds taken from living people to produce lost-wax portraits, and to have also developed a technique of casting from existing statues. He came from a family of sculptors and his brother, Lysippos of Sicyon, produced fifteen hundred statues in his career.Gagarin, 403 The Statue of Zeus at Olympia and the Statue of Athena Parthenos (both chryselephantine and executed by Phidias or under his direction, and considered to be the greatest of the Classical Sculptures), are lost, although smaller copies (in other materials) and good descriptions of both still exist. Their size and magnificence prompted rivals to seize them in the Byzantine period, and both were removed to Constantinople, where they were later destroyed. Image:009MA Kritios.jpgKritios Boy.

Greek art became increasingly diverse, influenced by the cultures of the peoples drawn into the Greek orbit, by the conquests of Alexander the Great (336 to 323 BC). In the view of some art historians, this is described as a decline in quality and originality; however, individuals of the time may not have shared this outlook. Many sculptures previously considered classical masterpieces are now known to be of the Hellenistic age. The technical ability of the Hellenistic sculptors are clearly in evidence in such major works as the Winged Victory of Samothrace, and the Pergamon Altar. New centres of Greek culture, particularly in sculpture, developed in Alexandria, Antioch, Pergamum, and other cities. By the 2nd century BC, the rising power of Rome had also absorbed much of the Greek tradition‚Äîand an increasing proportion of its products as well. During this period, sculpture again experienced a shift towards increasing naturalism. Common people, women, children, animals, and domestic scenes became acceptable subjects for sculpture, which was commissioned by wealthy families for the adornment of their homes and gardens. Realistic figures of men and women of all ages were produced, and sculptors no longer felt obliged to depict people as ideals of beauty or physical perfection. At the same time, new Hellenistic cities springing up in Egypt, Syria, and Anatolia required statues depicting the gods and heroes of Greece for their temples and public places. This made sculpture, like pottery, an industry, with the consequent standardisation and (some) lowering of quality. For these reasons, quite a few more Hellenistic statues survive to the present than those of the Classical period. Alongside the natural shift towards naturalism, there was a shift in expression of the sculptures as well. Sculptures began expressing more power and energy during this time period. An easy way to see the shift in expressions during the Hellenistic period would be to compare it to the sculptures of the Classical period. The classical period had sculptures such as the Charioteer of Delphi expressing humility. The sculptures of the Hellenistic period however saw greater expressions of power and energy as demonstrated in the Jockey of Artemision.Stele, R. Web. 24 November 2013. Some of the best known Hellenistic sculptures are the Winged Victory of Samothrace (2nd or 1st century BC), the statue of Aphrodite from the island of Melos known as the Venus de Milo (mid-2nd century BC), the Dying Gaul (about 230 BC), and the monumental group Laoco√∂n and His Sons (late 1st century BC). All these statues depict Classical themes, but their treatment is far more sensuous and emotional than the austere taste of the Classical period would have allowed or its technical skills permitted. Hellenistic sculpture was also marked by an increase in scale, which culminated in the Colossus of Rhodes (late 3rd century), thought to have been roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty. The combined effect of earthquakes and looting have destroyed this as well as any other very large works of this period that might have existed. Following the conquests of Alexander the Great, Greek culture spread as far as India, as revealed by the excavations of Ai-Khanoum in eastern Afghanistan, and the civilization of the Greco-Bactrians and the Indo- Greeks. Greco-Buddhist art represented a syncretism between Greek art and the visual expression of Buddhism. Discoveries made since the end of the 19th century surrounding the (now submerged) ancient Egyptian city of Heracleum include a 4th-century BC depiction of Isis. The depiction is unusually sensual for depictions of the Egyptian goddess, as well as being uncharacteristically detailed and feminine, marking a combination of Egyptian and Hellenistic forms around the time of Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt. In Goa, India, were found Buddha statues in Greek styles. These are attributed to Greek converts to Buddhism, many of whom are known to have settled in Goa during Hellenistic times.(see Pius Melkandathil,Martitime activities of Goa and the Indian ocean.)

File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPGGravestone of a woman with her child slave attending to her, c. 100 BC (early period of Roman Greece) Cult images Reproduction of the Athena Parthenos statue at the original size in the Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee. All ancient Greek temples and Roman temples normally contained a cult image in the cella. Access to the cella varied, but apart from the priests, at the least some of the general worshippers could access the cella some of the time, though sacrifices to the deity were normally made on altars outside in the temple precinct (tenemos in Greek). Some cult images were easy to see, and were what we would call major tourist attractions. The image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, originally less than life- size, then typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life- size, in marble or bronze, or in the specially prestigious form of a Chryselephantine statue using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework. The most famous Greek cult images were of this type, including the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, and Phidias's Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon in Athens, both colossal statues now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine statues from Delphi have been excavated. Cult images generally held or wore identifying attributes, which is one way of distinguishing them from the many other statues of deities in temples and other locations. The acrolith was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body. A xoanon was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu lingam; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity. Many of the Greek statues well known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the Apollo Barberini, can be credibly identified. A very few actual originals survive, for example the bronze Piraeus Athena (2.35 metres high, including a helmet). In Greek and Roman mythology, a \\"palladium\\" was an image of great antiquity on which the safety of a city was said to depend, especially the wooden one that Odysseus and Diomedes stole from the citadel of Troy and which was later taken to Rome by Aeneas. (The Roman story was related in Virgil's Aeneid and other works.)

These are the content, goods and services that consumers can buy by charging the cost to their phone bills and pre-pay phone accounts. It was founded as the Independent Committee for the supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) at the request of three network operators (British Telecom, Mercury Communications, and Vodafone) as a response to public criticism of their profiting from adult premium rate content. It re-branded itself as PhonepayPlus in June 2007. It regulates services using a Code of Practice, approved by Ofcom. This sets out the rules with which all providers of phone-paid services must comply. Among other things, it requires clear and accurate pricing information, honest advertising and service content, and appropriate and targeted promotions. The code is updated approximately annually. The Phone-paid Services Authority investigates complaints about phone-paid services. Where it decides that its rules have been broken, it can fine the company responsible, bar access to its services, and even bar the individual behind the company from running other services under a different company name. Investigations and adjudications are free to consumers and are supposed to be fully independent. The Phone-paid Services Authority regulates services using the following number ranges: 070, 087, 090, 091, 098 and 118, plus five-digit mobile shortcodes. Phone-paid Services Authority powers When the Phone-paid Services Authority upholds a breach of its Code, the company responsible must immediately amend the service and/or its promotional material so that it complies with the Code. In most cases, companies found in breach of the Code will be charged to cover the cost of the investigation. The Phone-paid Services Authority also has the power to impose the following sanctions: # formal reprimands # making companies come to the regulator for prior approval # ordering companies to pay full refunds to complainants # imposing fines # barring access to services # banning named persons from operating services Phone-paid Services Authority board Chairs of the board have included: *Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, Lawyer *Brenda Dean, Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, Trade Unionist *Sir Peter North (academic) *Sir Alistair Graham, Fmr Chair of the Committee on standards in public life Members of the board have included: *Matti Alderson, regulator *Dr. Howard Baderman, A & E consultant *Ruth Evans *Hugh Griffiths,Telecoms veteran *Jeremy Hallsworth, Chief Executive Officer of BT agilemedia *Valerie Howarth, Baroness Howarth of Breckland, Child care activist and founder of Childline *Yvonne Light, Writer & journalist *Kate Marcus, Barrister *Claire Milne, Telecoms veteran *Mark Stephens (solicitor), Lawyer, mediator and regulator *Howard Webber, Consumer champion *Paul Whiteing, regulator References External links * Official website Communications authorities Regulators of the United Kingdom Telecommunications organisations in the United Kingdom ","title":"Phone-paid Services Authority"},{"id":"1797089","text":"The Republic of China competed as Chinese Taipei at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. 31 competitors, 23 men and 8 women, took part in 15 events in 7 sports.

With a drummer (Darren Shearer), bass guitarist (Dan Kurtz, now playing with Dragonette), and keyboard player (Jamie Shields), the music incorporates many elements of modern electronica, which they have branded live progressive breakbeat house. History The band formed in 1998 after an impromptu jam session they had at the Toronto venue the Comfort Zone. Upon listening to a recording of the show, they were transfixed by how much it sounded like a DJ mix. They subsequently released the jam session as their first album, This Is Live. The band was without a name prior to the release of This Is Live. Jamie Shields, whose previous band One Step Beyond had wrapped up recently, indicated that the band hadn't settled on a name. At one point, they were calling themselves \\"Reprise\\". \\"The New Deal\\" stuck shortly afterwards. Originally billing themselves as an acid jazz group, they soon found themselves swept up into the emerging musical genre of livetronica. The drumming of Shearer often resembles the simplicity of a drum machine, while still tastefully complementing the accompanying music. Shields never loops a keyboard track and always plays everything live, even if a pattern is to be repeated. Thanks to the widespread sharing of bootleg versions of their early live shows, a national buzz ensued and within two years, and they signed a major label contract with Jive Electro. The promotion with Jive proved disappointing, and the band fell short of a highly anticipated crossover. Nonetheless, they continued to tour, developing their fanbase, including a performance in Toronto at the Palais Royale in 2001.\\"LIVE: The New Deal\\". Chart Attack, October 22, 2001. Review by Darrin Keene They released several more live shows on a label they created, Sound+Light Records, and produced two studio releases in 2003: Please Be Seated and Gone Gone Gone. In 2004, after a year-long hiatus, The New Deal toured several cities, often playing to crowds of 800 or more demonstrating the continued devotion of their fans. The band continued to tour, and over 200 recorded shows have been made available at the Internet Archive and etree for downloading. In recent years, seeing the band live has been difficult as concerts have become sporadic. Only a few recent concerts have been made available because of difficulties accommodating \\"tapers\\" and obtaining soundboard recordings. On April 8, 2011, an e-mail was sent out stating The New Deal would be breaking up in 2011. According to the e-mail, the band feels \\"We have come to a point where the time and commitment that it takes to maintain our band at its best is no longer possible.\\". A summer and fall tour took place throughout North America to end off the 12-year career. In April 2014, the band resurrected their website with the text, \\"The New Deal is Back ‚Äì Summer 2014\\". Joel Stouffer was brought on board as a new drummer in 2014. According to Shields, original drummer Darren Shearer left the music business after the group originally parted ways. May, Jake https://jambands.com/features/2020/06/18/a-fairly-organic-affair-jamie- shields-on-the-new-deal-the-omega-moos-the-state-of-the-jam-scene/ Jambands.com On March 20, 2019 the band announced on Facebook that they are coming back together for a short summer run of 4 shows with Davide Di Renzo as a new drummer, going on to say \\"With Davide it‚Äôs a bit like ‚Äòcoming back home‚Äô as he was the drummer that inspired our original direction back in 1998 when the three of us played our first impromptu gig together in Guelph, Ontario. Each of the band's drummers has brought something unique to theNEWDEAL, and with Davide we‚Äôre reaching back to move forward with the organic-infused improvisation that has long-inspired a big part of theNEWDEAL sound.\\" In August of that year they announced a tour schedule through the following February with Di Renzo.

She died of mercury poisoning at the age of 48 due to accidental exposure to the organic mercury compound dimethylmercury (Hg(CH3)2). Protective gloves in use at the time of the incident provided insufficient protection, and exposure to only a few drops of the chemical absorbed through the gloves proved to be fatal after less than a year. Career Wetterhahn was born in Plattsburgh, New York, and had degrees from St. Lawrence University and Columbia University. She joined Dartmouth's faculty in 1976 and published more than 85 research papers. In 1990, Wetterhahn helped establish Dartmouth College's Women in Science Project (WISP), which helped to raise the share of women science majors from 13 to 25 percent at Dartmouth College and has become a national model. Accident and death On August 14, 1996, Wetterhahn, a specialist in toxic metal exposure, was studying the way mercury ions interact with DNA repair proteins, and she was investigating the toxic properties of another highly toxic heavy metal, cadmium. Dimethylmercury was a compound used, almost exclusively, as a reference standard for 199Hg nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, a particular type of specialized chemical analysis. Wetterhahn would recall that she had spilled one or two drops of dimethylmercury from the tip of a pipette onto her latex-gloved hand. Not believing herself in any immediate danger, as she was taking all recommended precautions, she proceeded to clean up the area prior to removing her protective clothing. However, tests later revealed that dimethylmercury can, in fact, rapidly permeate different kinds of latex gloves and enter the skin within about 15 seconds. The exposure was later confirmed by hair testing, which showed a dramatic jump in mercury levels 17 days after the initial accident, peaking at 39 days, followed by a gradual decline. Approximately three months after the initial accident Wetterhahn began experiencing brief episodes of abdominal discomfort and noted significant weight loss. The more distinctive neurological symptoms of mercury poisoning, including loss of balance and slurred speech, appeared in January 1997, five months after the accident. At this point, tests proved that she had a debilitating mercury intoxication. Her urinary mercury content had risen to 234 ¬µg per liter; its normal range is from 1 to 5 and the toxic level is > 50 Œºg/L. Despite aggressive chelation therapy, her condition rapidly deteriorated. Three weeks after the first neurological symptoms appeared, Wetterhahn lapsed into what appeared to be a vegetative state punctuated by periods of extreme agitation. One of her former students said that \\"Her husband saw tears rolling down her face. I asked if she was in pain. The doctors said it didn't appear that her brain could even register pain.\\" Wetterhahn was removed from life support and died on June 8, 1997, less than a year after her initial exposure. Legacy Wetterhahn's death shocked not only the entire chemistry department at Dartmouth, but also regulatory agencies, as the accidental exposure occurred despite her having taken all required measures known at that time. These included the use of latex gloves, a fume hood, and adherence to standard safety procedures. After Wetterhahn's mercury poisoning was discovered, her colleagues tested various safety gloves against dimethylmercury and found that the small, apolar molecule diffuses through most of them in seconds, much more quickly than expected. As a result, it is now recommended to wear plastic laminate gloves when handling dimethylmercury. At the time, dimethylmercury was the common calibration standard for 199Hg NMR spectroscopy because it has certain advantages over the alternatives that exist. As a consequence of Wetterhahn's accident, safety recommendations have been revised, and the use of dimethylmercury for any purpose has been highly discouraged. Dartmouth College has since established an award in Wetterhahn's name to encourage other women to pursue careers in science. Whenever possible, preference in granting the award is given to a woman. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences also maintains an annual award, for a graduate student or post-doctoral researcher, in honor of Karen Wetterhahn.

H. Stuart, following the American Civil War, when Virginia was required to adopt a new Constitution acknowledging the abolition of slavery before its readmission into the Union. They engineered the federal and state political machinery so that separate votes would be taken on the constitution (which was overwhelmingly ratified) and provisions restricting voting and office-holding rights of former Confederates (which was narrowly defeated). Background Following the American Civil War and testimony before Congress that President Andrew Johnson's self-reconstruction was not allowing newly freed slaves many civil rights, Congress passed four Reconstruction Acts which set forth requirements for civilians to take control over the state governments in formerly Confederate states, instead of the military. Because Virginia's 1850 Constitution supported slavery, which became illegal during the American Civil War, and the delegates drafting the 1864 Constitution under provisional Governor Francis Harrison Pierpont did not represent the entire state, Virginia needed to draft and adopt a new Constitution to end military rule. Many high-ranking former Confederates were not permitted and others chose not to vote for members of the Constitutional Convention of 1867-68, which included African-American delegates and abolitionist federal judge John Curtiss Underwood dominated. The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 actually began its work in December 1867. Virginia newspapers and Conservatives, including Alexander H.H. Stuart, began criticizing the Convention, particularly its African-American members, during that month. Nonetheless, the Convention continued, and did include former Confederates as members. Major areas of debate concerned state administration, voting regulations, restrictions on officeholding by former Confederates, and social policies. During acrimonious sessions in early 1868, many Conservative members either left or were dismissed by the Convention before it approved a draft in April, which needed to be approved by voters. The \\"Underwood Constitution\\" included \\"free schools for both races, equal rights provisions, and reforms of local government.\\" It also included controversial and very strict clauses concerning ex-Confederates, which were unpopular, so Virginia's military ruler during Congressional Reconstruction, General John Schofield, and later President-elect Ulysses S. Grant delayed the ratification vote for what turned out to be more than a year. Meanwhile, by the autumn of 1868, Virginia's Republican party split because of the anti-Confederate provisions. Governor Henry H. Wells (who succeeded Pierpont) argued that Unionists would be at risk in Virginia if the disabling clauses were removed from the proposed Virginia Constitution. Stuart had appointed former Confederate general John Echols as part of a committee of three, along with F. G. Ruffin and James D. Johnston, which was to recommend eight other men to serve in the Committee of Nine. Echols would never formally become a member of the Committee of Nine, although he worked closely with Stuart to publish the \\"Senex\\" letter described below and set up the compromise. By the end of 1868, Republicans who had been displeased with the final constitution approved by the convention joined forces with what formally became the Committee of Nine. These Republicans, such as Edgar Allan and Franklin Stearns, worked with the committee in Washington in the fight for a separate vote on the anti-Confederate provisions. They joined in meeting important Congressmen since the Republicans dominated the Congress at the time, and their work proved influential. Nonetheless, when the Congress reassembled in December 1868, the Virginia Republican executive committee requested a vote on the Underwood constitution. On December 9, the House Committee of Reconstruction passed a bill to provide money for the referendum, however, the Christmas holiday recess arrived before the Senate received the bill. Formal creation of Committee of Nine A narrative of the leading incidents of the organization of the first popular movement in Virginia in 1865 to re-establish peaceful relations between the northern and southern states, and the subsequent efforts of the \\"Committee of Nine,\\" in 1869, to secure the restoration of Virginia to the Union. Alexander H. H. Stuart wanted to get rid of the disenfranchisement clauses (which Conservatives particularly disliked, and moderate Republicans thought abrogated General Grant's terms given to Confederate General Robert E. Lee) before the referendum was held. Stuart wrote a letter to outline his plans and publicize his objections concerning the clauses. He argued for universal amnesty and for the creation of another constitution with the disenfranchisement clauses to present to the Congress. His letter was published in the Richmond papers under the pseudonym, \\"Senex.\\" In his work, \\"A narrative of the leading incidents of the organization of the first popular movement in Virginia in 1865 to re-establish peaceful relations between the northern and southern states, and the subsequent efforts of the \\"Committee of Nine,\\" in 1869, to secure the restoration of Virginia to the Union\\", Alexander H. H. Stuart describes his motives behind writing and publishing the letter as following: > \\"I have no doubt that hundreds‚Äînay, thousands‚Äîof my fellow-citizens thought > and felt as I did as to the necessity of taking action on the subject. But > no one seemed to be willing to assume the responsibility of taking the lead! > Under these circumstances, as the necessity for moving in the matter was > urgent, and the time within which action likely to lead to a successful > result was limited to two weeks, I determined to sound a note of alarm by > calling the attention of the people of Virginia to the frightful dangers > which threatened them, and urging those who thought as I did to unite in an > organized attempt to avert them. With this object in view, I wrote ‚Äúa > communication,‚Äù over the signature ‚ÄúSenex,‚Äù intended for publication in the > Richmond Dispatch. This paper was written entirely on my own responsibility, > and without conference or consultation with anyone. My purpose was to try > and arouse the people to the necessity of immediate action, and to suggest > as the most feasible, if not the only, means of obtaining relief from the > disenfranchisement and test oaths embodied in the Underwood Constitution, > the tender to Congress on behalf of Virginia of a compromise, on the basis > of universal suffrage as an equivalent for universal amnesty.\\" Campaign in Washington Although some Conservatives criticized Stuart's letter, many moderates and centrist Virginians favored Stuart's plan. These Virginians met at the Exchange Hotel, in Richmond, on December 31, 1868 and January 1, 1869. Their meetings led to the creation of the Committee of Nine: Alexander H. H. Stuart would act as a chairman to a committee of nine people who would visit Washington to voice objections concerning the Underwood Constitution. The committee aimed to go to Washington to authorize separate votes on the proposed new state constitution, and the provision which continued to disenfranchise former Confederates (mostly white Virginians) under the Reconstruction Acts. John L. Marye, of Fredericksburg, one of the members of the Committee of Nine, suggested that Stuart invite Gilbert C. Walker, a northerner and who had been \\"defeated for a seat in the Underwood convention\\", to help the committee gain support in Washington. As predicted, Walker, a northern Republican, helped the committee receive sympathy in the north. Horace Greeley's Republican newspaper, New York Tribune, joined the campaign. The Committee of Nine spent approximately two weeks in Washington. They met with congressmen and appeared before both the House and Senate committees. Upon meeting with the Committee of Nine, and despite Governor Wells following the Committee of Nine and their supporters around in Washington, Congress approved the separation of the disabling clauses. However, in order to be readmitted, it required Virginia to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment as well. President Grant and the 1869 Virginia Gubernatorial Election During meetings with members of the Committee of Nine in Washington, President-elect Grant showed sympathy towards the committee's objects and plans. Grant was inaugurated on March 4, 1869. On May 14, 1869, President Grant issued the following proclamation: > ‚ÄúEvery person who has been a Senator or Representative in Congress, or > elector of President or Vice-President, or who held any office, civil or > military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having > previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the > United States, or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an executive > or judicial officer of any State, shall have engaged in insurrection or > rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.‚Äù The committee thus achieved its goal of authorizing a separate vote for the provisions restricting former Confederates and sympathizers. Letter Announcing Virginia's Readmission to the United States, 1870 Radical Republicans and Governor Wells (who became their candidate for actual election as Governor) wanted the referendum to take place as the Convention had stated. They feared that the separate votes would lead to failure of the anti-Confederate provisions and thus restore conservative dominance in the state. In March 1869, Virginia Republicans held a convention to nominate candidates for the state elections. Moderate Republicans were sometimes referred to as \\"Stearns Republicans\\", after Franklin Stearns, and also included William L. Owen, and Gilbert C. Walker. Although they failed to gain control of the Republican party, they nominated Walker, a former northern businessman as a moderate candidate. The alliance between the moderate Republicans and Conservatives led to Gilbert C. Walker winning the Gubernatorial Election of 1869. Even though Radical Republicans, who had passed the Reconstruction Acts in 1866, still dominated the Congress, because the provisions of the new Constitution other than the anti-Confederate provisions passed overwhelmingly, Virginia was readmitted into the Union on January 26, 1870. Virginia's new Governor, Gilbert C. Walker, signed a letter announcing the readmission. Committee members * Alexander H. H.

She is a member of the Canadian short track relay team that won gold at the 1992 Winter Olympics and silver at the 1994 Winter Olympics. She is also a five-time Overall World Champion (for 1979, 1983, 1988‚Äì1990). She was born in Sherbrooke, Quebec. Career First competing in 1979, she has participated, and triumphed, in long-track events during the Canada Winter Games that year, winning gold in the 500-metre, 1000-metre and 1500-metre competitions. The following year in Lake Placid at the 1980 Winter Olympics, Sylvie Daigle finished 19th in the 500-metre. At Sarajevo in the 1984 Winter Olympics, she was 20th in the 500-metre, 25th in the 1000-metre and 22nd in the 1500-metre. A pair of operations in 1985 and 1987, aimed at relieving the pain in her knees, led her to re-direct her career. Consequently, in 1987, she decided to devote herself to short-track speed skating (having won the Overall Short- track World Championships in 1979 and in 1983), which was introduced the following year as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. There, Sylvie won a gold in the 1500-metre, silver in the 1000-metre and 3000-metre, and bronze in the 500-metre and 3000-metre relay. Daigle re- claimed the Overall World Championship after 5-year hiatus in 1988 and defended the title in 1989 and in 1990, becoming the first person to have won five Overall World Titles, including three consecutive titles. (Two other athletes have equalled her number of World Titles since.) At the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, short-track speed skating was an officially registered sport. There, Sylvie won the gold medal in the 3000-metre relay, but finished in 18th place in the 500-metre after a collision with American skater Cathy Turner during the preliminary round. Following the Albertville Games, she started medical studies at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, but suspended it to resume her training, with the goal of participating in the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. There, she won a silver medal. Daigle left the world of skating following the Lillehammer Games in order to finish her studies, obtaining a medical degree from the Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1998.

His first hit was an RBI single to right field off Aaron Myette of the Texas Rangers on September 15, 2002. His first full season in the majors was 2004. On May 14, 2004, he went 5-for-6 in a 10 inning game against the Baltimore Orioles and hit his first home run off Kurt Ainsworth of the Orioles. His breakout year came in 2005, when he was moved to leadoff hitter after original leadoff hitter David Eckstein signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. He used his speed to steal an American League-high 62 bases, the second-most in Angels history. That year, he played two positions in the same game 24 times. He was named team co-MVP of the 2005 season for the Angels, along with Bartolo Col√≥n. Prior to the 2006 season, the Angels signed Figgins to a three-year, $10.5-million deal.

Along with third base, Figgins also played shortstop, second base, and all three outfield positions. Although he was initially considered for the center field job in 2006, the Angels decided to move Darin Erstad back to the position. Figgins became the starter at third base.Scarr, Mike.

Figgins had his worst year to date in 2010, batting just .259, though he did match his previous season stolen base total of 42. Following the season, Figgins converted back to third base, due to the departure of Lopez. Halfway through the 2011 season, he was replaced by Adam Kennedy as the everyday third baseman. In only 81 games, with only 288 at bats, Figgins finished the season batting only .188. To begin the 2012 season, Figgins was allowed the opportunity to bat leadoff for the Mariners in the hopes that the return to the spot in the lineup where he thrived during his time with the Angels would jump start his bat. On May 4 of that season, manager Eric Wedge announced that Figgins would no longer be an everyday player. He ended the 2012 season batting .181 with 166 at bats in 66 games and was designated for assignment by the Mariners on November 20, 2012. =Miami Marlins= On February 8, 2013, he signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. However, he did not make the team out of spring training and was released on March 20. =Los Angeles Dodgers= After sitting out the 2013 season, Figgins signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for 2014. The Dodgers purchased his contract on March 16 and added him to the Major League roster. In 38 games with the Dodgers, he appeared as a utility player/pinch hitter and hit .217, though he had a .373 OBP due to drawing 14 walks in 76 plate appearances. He was placed on the disabled list in mid-June with a hip injury and then spent an extended time with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes on a rehab assignment. The Dodgers designated him for assignment on August 6, 2014. The Dodgers asked for unconditional release waivers on August 13. Figgins was not signed by another team. =Retirement= On March 20, 2016, Figgins announced his retirement from professional baseball. He signed a one-day contract with the Angels in order to retire with the team. Personal life Chone Figgins and his wife, Claudia, had a son, Desmond, Jr., in 2015.

Though a popular cautionary tale in medieval Europe, no historical evidence for The Treachery of the Long Knives exists, and the story has been widely debunked as a purely literary construction by historians.John Morris, Nennius: British History and the Welsh Annals (Phillimore, London & Chichester 1980), pp. 3‚Äì5. Legendary context According to the tradition, Vortigern, who had become a high king of the Britons in the wake of the end of Roman rule in Britain, called for Anglo-Saxons under Hengist and Horsa to settle on the Isle of Thanet in exchange for their service as mercenaries in battles against the Picts and Gaels in Scotland. The settlers, however, exploit a drunken Vortigern's lust for Hengist's daughter into allowing them to increase their numbers and granting them more land, eventually including all of the Kingdom of Kent. Historia Brittonum There is no account of this event in the 6th- century writings of Gildas. The story first appears in the much later Historia Brittonum, attributed to the Welsh historian Nennius, which was a compilation in Latin of various materials (some of which were historical and others mythic, literary or legendary) put together during the early 9th century, and surviving in 9th-century manuscripts ‚Äì i.e., some 400 years after the supposed events. According to John Morris's textual analysis of the Historia, this tale derived from a north Welsh narrative which was mainly about Emrys (Ambrosius Aurelianus), which the compiler of the Historia incorporated into a framework drawn from a Kentish chronicle, together with details from a Life of Saint Germanus.J. Morris, Nennius: British History and the Welsh Annals (Phillimore, London & Chichester 1980), pp. 3‚Äì5. This is a literal translation of the Latin from Edmond Faral's (Paris 1929) edition of the text (sections in square brackets [thus] supplied from T. Mommsen's 1892 edition):From Latin as given by Morris 1980, cf. Introductory note & pp. 72‚Äì73. > It happened however after the death of Vortimer, son of King Vortigern, and > after the return of Hengist with his forces, they called for a false > Council, so that they might work sorrow to Vortigern with his army. For they > sent legates to ask for peace, that there might be perpetual friendship > between them. So Vortigern himself with the elders by birth of his people > [considered the matter and carefully thought over what they might do. And > the same] opinion was with them all, that they should make peace, and their > legates went back and afterwards called together the conference, so that on > either side the Britons and Saxons (Brittones et Saxones) should come > together as one without arms, so that friendship should be sealed. > > And Hengistus ordered the whole of his household that each one should hide > his knife (artavum) under his foot in the middle of his shoe. 'And when I > shall call out to you and say \\"Eu nimet saxas\\" (Hey, draw your swords!), > then draw your knives (cultellos) from the soles of your shoes, and fall > upon them, and stand strongly against them. And do not kill their king, but > seize him for the sake of my daughter whom I gave to him in matrimony, > because it is better for us that he should be ransomed from our hands.' And > they brought together the conference, and the Saxons, speaking in a friendly > way, meanwhile were thinking in a wolvish way, and sociably they sat down > man beside man (i.e. Saxon beside Briton). Hengistus, as he had said, spoke > out, and all the three hundred elders of King Vortigern were slaughtered, > and only he was imprisoned, and was chained, and he gave to them many > regions for the ransom of his soul (i.e. life), that is Est Saxum, Sut saxum > [, Middelseaxan, with other districts under his control which they named.]  Geoffrey of Monmouth  The Treachery of the Long Knives is also described in Book 6 of the Historia Regum Britanniae by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote during the early 12th century and presumably used Nennius as his main source. According to him, the incident took place at a banquet in modern-day Wiltshire, ostensibly arranged to seal a peace treaty, which may have been the cession of Essex and Sussex in exchange for intermarriage between Rowena, the daughter of Saxon chieftain Hengest, and Vortigern. The story claims that the \\"Saxons\\" ‚Äî which probably includes Angles and Jutes ‚Äì arrived at the banquet armed with their long knives (seaxes) hidden on their persons. During the feast, on a given word of command, they pulled their knives and killed the unarmed Britons sitting next to them. Vortigern himself was spared, but all his men were butchered, except Eldol, Earl of Gloucester, who escaped. Legacy In 19th-century Wales, the term Brad y Llyfrau Gleision ('The Treachery of the Blue Books') was coined to refer to the report of the English commissioners on education in Wales, published in parliamentary blue covers in 1847, which was widely seen as an attack on the Welsh language. One of the effects of the report would be the exclusion of the Welsh language from Welsh schools for several generations and a consequent fall in the number of Welsh speakers.Prys Morgan, 'From Long Knives to Blue Books' in Welsh Society and Nationhood (ed. R. R. Davies et al., Cardiff, 1981) The name Night of the Long Knives was later used for a violent political purge in Nazi Germany, when Hitler destroyed the power of the Sturmabteilung in 1934. It was also used flippantly when British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan dismissed seven members of his cabinet in a \\"night of the long knives\\". It has also been used to refer to the assassination of Alexander Burnes in November 1841 in Kabul, Afghanistan. In Canada the term was used by Quebec premiere Ren√© L√©vesque in reference to the repatriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1981. (Before that time, the final constitutional authority for Canada resided in the United Kingdom). Initially eight of the 10 provincial premieres were opposed to repatriating the constitution. A compromise was hammered out in L√©vesque's absence, and 9 of the 10 (only Quebec dissenting) agreed to it.

It is located on the university's Health Sciences campus in northeastern Los Angeles which is adjacent to the Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights neighborhoods. Programs In addition to a medical degree (MD), the school offers various combined degrees, such as MD/MPH, MD/PhD and MD/MBA. The school offers separate master's and doctoral degree programs in various biomedical fields. It also offers programs in physician assistantship and nurse anesthesia. The joint MD-PhD program is part of a cooperation with the California Institute of Technology located in nearby Pasadena. USC also offers a combined engineering and medicine graduate certificate program, available to both PhD and MD students. Affiliated hospitals = Teaching Hospitals = There are several teaching hospitals, including LAC+USC Medical Center, a Level I trauma center located in Los Angeles jointly operated by USC and the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.

July 16, 2013 Press release: USC closes deal to purchase Verdugo Hills Hospital Hospitals and clinics include the Keck Hospital of USC and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, which USC acquired from Tenet Healthcare in 2009 for $275 million after three years of litigation between the parties, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the USC Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale. History of the school The school was founded in 1885, and is the oldest medical school in Southern California. The school's association with Children's Hospital Los Angeles began in 1932. In 1970, it formed the first academic Department of Emergency Medicine in the United States. By 1983, the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center was opened. In 1991, the USC University Hospital, later to be renamed Keck Hospital of USC, was opened. In July 1999, the W. M. Keck Foundation donated $110 million to the USC School of Medicine. The school was then renamed the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. The school committed to raising $330 million in matching funds, and used a large portion of the gift to expand research efforts, including the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute. In 2015, Paul Aisen, who leads the US Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and its approximately $100 million in funding, left University of California San Diego and joined the faculty of Keck. Aisen had been recruited to UCSD from Georgetown in 2007 to run the ADCS which UCSD had established in 1991. Aisen left UCSD because he was unhappy with the level of support that UCSD was providing him and due to the offer from USC. UCSD and USC ended up in litigation over control of the program. USC rented space for Aisen in a San Diego office park, where Keck's Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute is located under Aisen's direction. Some aspects of data management were temporarily settled in 2016; as of 2017 the litigation was ongoing. A report in Nature noted that Keck had been recruiting from San Diego, hiring four scientists from Scripps Research Institute after a proposed merger fell through, and that Keck had recruited the director of the UCSD Health System to run its Children's Hospital. In March 2016 Carmen Puliafito resigned as dean and Rohit Varma became the interim dean, and was named dean in November of that year. On May 1, 2018, Laura Mosqueda was appointed as dean of the school. She is a professor of Family Medicine and Geriatrics. Controversies The Los Angeles Times reported in July 2017 that while Puliafito served as dean and USC professor, he \\"kept company with a circle of criminals and drug users who said he used methamphetamine and other drugs with them.\\" The reporters reviewed video and photographs of Puliafito engaging in these activities in hotel rooms, apartments, and the dean's office. According to the newspaper, a 21-year-old prostitute had overdosed while taking drugs with Puliafito in a Pasadena hotel room on March 4, 2016; the article included a recording of a conversation between a 911 operator and Puliafito. The report said that police had found methamphetamine in the room. Puliafito resigned as dean three weeks afterwards. Immediately following the publication of the Los Angeles Times report, USC announced that Puliafito had been placed \\"on leave from his roles at USC, including seeing patients.\\"Adam Elmahrek, Sarah Parvini, Paul Pringle & Matt Hamilton, Former USC medical school dean no longer seeing patients; Pasadena police discipline officer, Los Angeles Times (July 17, 2017).

At low bit rates, i.e. high compression ratios, most of the coefficients produced by a subband transform (such as the wavelet transform) will be zero, or very close to zero. This occurs because \\"real world\\" images tend to contain mostly low frequency information (highly correlated). However where high frequency information does occur (such as edges in the image) this is particularly important in terms of human perception of the image quality, and thus must be represented accurately in any high quality coding scheme. By considering the transformed coefficients as a tree (or trees) with the lowest frequency coefficients at the root node and with the children of each tree node being the spatially related coefficients in the next higher frequency subband, there is a high probability that one or more subtrees will consist entirely of coefficients which are zero or nearly zero, such subtrees are called zerotrees. Due to this, we use the terms node and coefficient interchangeably, and when we refer to the children of a coefficient, we mean the child coefficients of the node in the tree where that coefficient is located. We use children to refer to directly connected nodes lower in the tree and descendants to refer to all nodes which are below a particular node in the tree, even if not directly connected. In zerotree based image compression scheme such as EZW and SPIHT, the intent is to use the statistical properties of the trees in order to efficiently code the locations of the significant coefficients. Since most of the coefficients will be zero or close to zero, the spatial locations of the significant coefficients make up a large portion of the total size of a typical compressed image. A coefficient (likewise a tree) is considered significant if its magnitude (or magnitudes of a node and all its descendants in the case of a tree) is above a particular threshold. By starting with a threshold which is close to the maximum coefficient magnitudes and iteratively decreasing the threshold, it is possible to create a compressed representation of an image which progressively adds finer detail. Due to the structure of the trees, it is very likely that if a coefficient in a particular frequency band is insignificant, then all its descendants (the spatially related higher frequency band coefficients) will also be insignificant. EZW uses four symbols to represent (a) a zerotree root, (b) an isolated zero (a coefficient which is insignificant, but which has significant descendants), (c) a significant positive coefficient and (d) a significant negative coefficient. The symbols may be thus represented by two binary bits. The compression algorithm consists of a number of iterations through a dominant pass and a subordinate pass, the threshold is updated (reduced by a factor of two) after each iteration. The dominant pass encodes the significance of the coefficients which have not yet been found significant in earlier iterations, by scanning the trees and emitting one of the four symbols. The children of a coefficient are only scanned if the coefficient was found to be significant, or if the coefficient was an isolated zero. The subordinate pass emits one bit (the most significant bit of each coefficient not so far emitted) for each coefficient which has been found significant in the previous significance passes. The subordinate pass is therefore similar to bit-plane coding. There are several important features to note. Firstly, it is possible to stop the compression algorithm at any time and obtain an approximation of the original image, the greater the number of bits received, the better the image. Secondly, due to the way in which the compression algorithm is structured as a series of decisions, the same algorithm can be run at the decoder to reconstruct the coefficients, but with the decisions being taken according to the incoming bit stream. In practical implementations, it would be usual to use an entropy code such as arithmetic code to further improve the performance of the dominant pass. Bits from the subordinate pass are usually random enough that entropy coding provides no further coding gain. The coding performance of EZW has since been exceeded by SPIHT and its many derivatives.  Introduction  Embedded zerotree wavelet algorithm (EZW) as developed by J. Shapiro in 1993, enables scalable image transmission and decoding. It is based on four key concepts: first, it should be a discrete wavelet transform or hierarchical subband decomposition; second, it should predict the absence of significant information when exploring the self-similarity inherent in images; third, it has entropy-coded successive- approximation quantization, and fourth, it is enabled to achieve universal lossless data compression via adaptive arithmetic coding. Besides, the EZW algorithm also contains the following features: (1) A discrete wavelet transform which can use a compact multiresolution representation in the image. (2) Zerotree coding which provides a compact multiresolution representation of significance maps. (3) Successive approximation for a compact multiprecision representation of the significant coefficients. (4) A prioritization protocol which the importance is determined by the precision, magnitude, scale, and spatial location of the wavelet coefficients in order. (5) Adaptive multilevel arithmetic coding which is a fast and efficient method for entropy coding strings of symbols.  Embedded Zerotree Wavelet Coding  = A. Encoding a coefficient of the significance map = In a significance map, the coefficients can be representing by the following four different symbols. With using these symbols to represent the image information, the coding will be less complication.  1. Zerotree root  If the magnitude of a coefficient is less than a threshold T, and all its descendants are less than T, then this coefficient is called zerotree root. And if a coefficient has been labeled as zerotree root, it means that all of its descendants are insignificant, so there is no need to label its descendants.  2. Isolated zero  If the magnitude of a coefficient that is less than a threshold T, but it still has some significant descendants, then this coefficient is called isolated zero.  3. Positive significant coefficient  If the magnitude of a coefficient is greater than a threshold T at level T, and also is positive, than it is a positive significant coefficient.  4. Negative significant coefficient  If the magnitude of a coefficient is greater than a threshold T at level T, and also is negative, than it is a negative significant coefficient. = B. Defining threshold = The threshold using above can be defined as the type below.  1. Initial threshold T0: (Assume Cmax is the largest coefficient.)  126x126px  2. Threshold Ti is reduced to half of the value of the previous threshold.  133x133px = C. Scanning order for coefficients = Raster scanning is the rectangular pattern of image capture and reconstruction. Using this scanning on EZW transform is to perform scanning the coefficients in such way that no child node is scanned before its parent node. Also, all positions in a given subband are scanned before it moves to the next subband. = D. Two-pass bitplane coding =  (1) Refinement pass (or subordinate pass)  This determine that if the coefficient is in the interval [Ti, 2Ti). And a refinement bit is coded for each significant coefficient. In this method, it will visit the significant coefficients according to the magnitude and raster order within subbands.  (2) Significant pass (or dominant pass)  This method will code a bit for each coefficient that is not yet be seen as significant. Once a determination of significance has been made, the significant coefficient is included in a list for further refinement in the refinement pass. And if any coefficient already known to be zero, it will not be coded again. See also * Set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) References *Shapiro, J. M., .

The route is in length and there is one intermediate station at . The line is part of Network Rail Strategic Route 7, SRS 07.09, and is classified as a rural line. The line is single-track throughout, electrified at 25 kV AC, has a loading gauge of W6, and a maximum speed of . As of May 2015 services are operated by London Overground, with two trains per hour in each direction. The timetabled journey time from one terminus to the other is nine minutes. It is completely separated from the rest of the London Overground. History The line was originally built as a branch of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR;) and opened on 7 June 1893 providing the LT&SR; with a link to the Great Eastern Railway at Romford and a small goods yard where the branch joins the Great Eastern Main Line. At Romford the branch had a separate station entrance in a three-storey building opposite the Great Eastern station entrance and a cast-iron footbridge was constructed over South Street which opened when a LT&SR; train was due. When in April 1934 the LT&SR; building ceased use as a station and the ground floor was rented as a shop, the then London and North Eastern Railway took control of the whole station. Part of a 1904 Railway Clearing House junction diagram showing the line between Romford and Upminster Emerson Park Halt was opened on 1 October 1909. A run-round loop was constructed 500 yards to the west to enable extra trains to run between Emerson Park and Upminster. When push-pull working began in 1934 the loop was no longer required and was removed in circa 1936. From 17 September 1956 a diesel multiple unit from replaced the steam service and from 20 April 1957 a new bay platform, numbered six, opened at effectively making it part of the Great Eastern route. There were some attempts to close the line in the 1960s, but these failed. It was later electrified, and electric trains began operating on 17 April 1986. The line transferred to become part of the London Overground network in May 2015. From 5 October 2020 the line has been operated using British Rail Class 710 rolling stock. https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2020/10/03/last-chance-to-ride-an-old-train- along-the-london-overground/ Infrastructure The branch is known colloquially as the \\"Romford Push and Pull\\" as it is single-track throughout. It is electrified at 25 kV AC. Electrification of the line saw an end to years of speculation about its future. There is only one intermediate station, at Emerson Park. At the connection west of the station to the main line was severed in 1968. The branch has just one signal, on approach to Romford. There were plans to link the line from platform six at Upminster to the reception tracks of the London Underground depot there. This would have allowed the transfer of London Underground D78 Stock units onto the main line to be hauled away by diesel locomotive for refurbishment at the Ilford depot. These plans were scrapped when the refurbishment work was transferred to Wakefield in Yorkshire and the transfer was done by road. The point-work which was half installed is still visible from the eastern end of platform five at Upminster. Services The line is entirely within Travelcard Zone 6. Services are currently operated by London Overground, which replaced the previous operator, Abellio Greater Anglia, in May 2015. Trains are typically formed by a Class 710. As of December 2015, the service pattern on the route is one train every 30 minutes between approximately 6:15 am and 10 pm Mondays to Saturdays, and approximately 8:30 am and 8 pm on Sundays.

It comprises a coeducational junior school, single-sex senior schools and a coeducational sixth form. Founded in 1705 as a charity, the original schools are two of the oldest schools in the city. History The building in College Street in use by the school from 1883 to 1935; now part of Northumbria University. The current building in Fenham in use by the school since 1935 They were founded by Dame Eleanor Allan, the daughter of a local goldsmith and the widow of a tobacco merchant, to provide a proper education for \\"40 poor boys and 20 poor girls of the parishes of St Nicholas and St John\\". The schools were endowed with land at Wallsend, to the east of Newcastle. The original school seems likely to have been near St Nicholas's Church, and certainly was by 1778. It moved to Manor Chare near All Saints' Church in 1786, to Carliol Square in 1821, to Rosemary Lane off Pudding Chare in 1861, and to Hanover Square in 1875. The school then moved to College Street in Newcastle in 1883 and remained there until 1935 when it re-located to the present site in Fenham. Until 1988 the schools operated as separate boys' and girls' schools with a joint governing body. The governors then took the decision to appoint a principal with overall responsibility for the management of the two schools. At the same time, they created a joint mixed sixth form and reintroduced a mixed junior school. The plural, \\"schools\\", refers to the fact that Dame Allan's operates in a diamond format. In effect, Dame Allan's consists of 4 different schools: the co- educational Junior school for nursery to Year 6 are located in a separate building in Spital Tongues; the single sex boys' and girls' schools for years 7 to 11; and the co-educational sixth form (years 12 to 13). Facilities A number of new classrooms were built between 2004 and 2005 to replace older facilities, with some intended specifically for the sixth form centre. The Sixth Form Centre was opened by Queen Elizabeth II during an official visit on 14 October 2005 and was named the Queen's Building. September 2012 saw the opening of the new nursery and junior school in Spital Tongues. 2015 saw Dame Allan's chosen as the recipient of a ¬£250,000 grant to help fund a ¬£500,000 project. The grant was given by the Reece Foundation which promotes the improvement of education in engineering, technology and related subjects. The new facility will build on the Schools' existing master class programme. Academics All schools are private, and potential candidates must pass written exams and an interview. The fees are currently () around ¬£4,412 per term in the Main Schools and ¬£4,312 per term in the Junior Department. These fees include books and external examination entry fees, but do not include meals (¬£3.72 per day). Scholarships of up to 50% are available on the basis of academic merit, and bursaries of up to 100% are available on the basis of academic merit and financial need. Being a private school, Dame Allan's does not strictly adhere to the National Curriculum. It does enter all its students in public examinations such as GCSEs and A-levels, so the subjects taught are closely tied into their national counterparts. All students must study English, mathematics, and the sciences to GCSE level, and it is strongly recommended that at least one foreign language be studied to this level. Sixth form students have a much wider range of study, with no mandatory subjects and the introduction of many new subjects in year 12, including A-levels in politics, psychology, sports, business and theatre studies. Dame Allan's is an Anglican school. In 2005 the school recorded its best ever set of exam results, including a handful of Top 5 results in several subjects, notably GCSE languages. Furthermore, two pupils were awarded 6 grade As at A-level. The school consistently performs to an extremely high standard in public examinations, with the girls' school often slightly outscoring the boys' school at GCSE level. The school has not yet been inspected by OFSTED but received a positive report from the independent schools Inspectorate in 2000.

Brothers) in June 1967, when three members of the B.B. Brothers, guitarist Claus B√∏hling, drummer Jens Otzen and British vocalist and bassist Mac MacLeod formed the power trio. Inspired by Cream but with more psychedelic leanings, they split from Peter Belli and MacLeod named the band 'Hurdy Gurdy'. They had considerable success in Scandinavia, breaking many attendance records for their live shows. The band moved to England in early 1968, after MacLeod had been deported from Denmark. From Denmark, MacLeod wrote to Donovan's manager Ashley Kozak on 19 December 1967 to ask if he could help the band in any way. Donovan wrote his song \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" for them as a gift for MacLeod. MacLeod came back to the U.K. in the new year to see Donovan and, a few weeks later, the rest of the band followed. After hearing Donovan's demo tape, the band set up outside his Little Berkhamsted cottage and played their version of the song. Donovan did not like the heavy take on the track they played as he wanted a softer, acoustic arrangement. Soon after, he released his own version of the song which became a hit, his version in the end had a similar arrangement to the Hurdy Gurdy version. Donovan told Keith Altham of the NME (and Hit Parader) in December 1968: While they were in the UK, they did some recordings produced by Chris White and Rod Argent of The Zombies. Two tracks by the MacLeod era of Hurdy Gurdy, \\"Tick Tock Man\\" and \\"Neo Camel\\", are on the Mac MacLeod anthology The Incredible Musical Odyssey of the Original Hurdy Gurdy Man and showcase the free-flowing power trio psychedelic rock sound that rivalled The Jimi Hendrix Experience in their live performances. Otzen and B√∏hling had to return to Denmark shortly after those recordings, as they were unable to secure work permits from the Musician's Union. A new bassist (Torben Forne) was recruited to replace MacLeod and, in early 1971, they released a self-titled album for CBS which has recently been reissued on CD. MacLeod briefly joined the post-Zombies group Argent. In 1993, B√∏hling re-formed the band and performed two concerts at the Cavern Club in Exeter.

ACS Athens embraces American educational philosophy, principles and values. It is located in Chalandri in the Athens area.\\"Contact Us.\\" American Community Schools. Retrieved on 20 February 2015. \\"129 Aghias Paraskevis Ave. & Kazantzaki Street Halandri 15234, Athens Greece\\" History In 1946, the British Army School was established in several homes in the Glyfada area of Athens to educate the children of British military personnel who were stationed in Greece at the close of the Second World War. The history of ACS Athens begins here; for shortly after its inauguration, the school began to admit British and American civilians. In 1949, many more American children arrived in Greece, and a high school was opened for them in Kolonaki. Also established was an elementary school, in Psychico, which was later moved to a facility in Filothei. The British Army School had metamorphosed into the Anglo-American school. The first yearbook of the new school, The Evzone, published in 1952, highlights the accomplishments of a graduating class of six seniors who had graduated from a school that now occupied a rented villa in Kifissia. This house, complete with towers and turrets, served as the school's home until 1961. The same yearbook also documents the activities of Junior School students in a facility in Kalamaki, which would serve as the home of the Junior School until its operations were transferred to a building on the American base later in the decade following an airplane accident. The 1954‚Äì55 school year marked another milestone in the history of the school. Chartered in the state of Delaware as a private, non-profit educational institution for the children of American diplomatic and military personnel, the Anglo-American School became the American Community Schools of Athens. From its inception, the school received no official subsidies, and its operations were funded by tuition fees. In December 1960, the ACS Athens School Board obtained funds under Public Law 480 to purchase land in Halandri, then a sleepy farming area, and began construction of a new school facility. The Class of 1962 was the first to graduate from the new facility. The 1962 Evzone contains the following paragraph: \\"This year's graduating class is the first to hold commencement exercises at the new American Academy located in the suburb of Halandri, approximately seven miles from the center of Athens. They were among 380 students who proudly took possession of the new building last September . Two-storied, containing twelve modern classrooms, two science laboratories, a library and a study hall, the building replaced an ancient villa in Kifissia on Tatoi Road which overflowed into four very unscholarly army huts. In the rear of our new school is a spacious playground area...By late spring of 1962, it appears that a new junior school will be erected on our present grounds, plus a gymnasium and an auditorium.\\" A photograph of the campus in this same yearbook shows the new school building surrounded by open fields dotted with a few farmhouses. Until the early 1980s, ACS Athens students would follow the rituals of the school day to the accompaniment of the sound of bells clanging from the necks of the flocks of sheep and goats pastured in the neighboring fields. The 1960s saw a continued expansion of the Halandri facilities. The Middle School was built in its present location in 1962; this was followed by the erection of the gymnasium the following year. In 1964, the first two stories of the current Annex building were erected to house an elementary school. The first two stories of the current Elementary School were built in 1968. Throughout these years, ACS Athens continued to operate separate Elementary School facilities in Kifissia and on base. In 1968, yet another branch of ACS Athens was established on the island of Rhodes, for the approximately thirty children of Voice of America personnel stationed there. This branch of the school operated until 1981. In 1963, the Greek government licensed the school to provide education to the children of Americans in official capacities. During that year, the school also began to admit students from the wider American and international expatriate communities in Greece, and ACS Athens began to take on an international flavor within the framework of an American school. (In the early 1980s, this license was amended, and ACS Athens was recognized by the Greek Ministry of Education as an educational institution for the international community in Greece.) The Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges accredited the high school in 1964. At the time, ACS Athens was one of only two international schools so distinguished. When, in 1983, the Middle States Association had expanded its accrediting authority to cover elementary and middle schools, ACS Athens received accreditation for its K-12 program. The decade of the 1970s found ACS Athens engaged in its most ambitious building program. In 1974, the school saw the building of the bridge, containing science labs, administrative offices and a conference room, connecting the Academy and the Middle School; the current cafeteria, which originally served as the library; the amphitheater; and finally, the current library and fine arts classrooms. Additions to Annex and Elementary School buildings during the decade resulted in their taking their current form. The school's academic program was also expanded during these years: in 1976, ACS Athens became the only school in Greece to offer students the opportunity to earn an International Baccalaureate diploma as they pursued their high school studies. In 1978, the Department of Defense assumed control of the operation of the base school; at the same time, the international mix of the student body was enhanced by the arrival of a large Arabic community in the Athens area. From 1976 to 1979 students that were Military Dependents from the U.S. Air Base located near the old International Airport near Glyfada just south of Athens were bused into Halandri via off duty Tourist Buses. The route to the school took American Service Personnel's children through the heart of Athens and right by the Acropolis. American children of US Service Military personnel made up the majority of the student body population. The other large group attending ACS from 1976 to 1979 was a group of American Students whose parents worked for the American diplomatic corps. Other type of students was Greek-American students, Oil Field Worker's dependents, Australian-Greek students and Norwegian students. The school's long time principal was demoted to teacher in 1976 and became the most popular teacher in school. \\"In 1979 there were 153 students that graduated from ACS in Athens\\" says Patrick Mahoney who attended ACS in Athens from 1976 through 1979, graduated High School in 1979, played Nose Tackle for the Cougars and who was the only member of the work study program for three years. In 1980, ACS Athens purchased the land currently occupied by the tennis courts. The Boarding Unit, originally housed in a hotel near the airport in Glyfada, and subsequently relocated to Kefalari and Nea Makri before moving to its current location in Mati, opened in 1981. As a result, the student body expanded to include, among others, many children of expatriate Americans working in the oil fields of the Arabian peninsula. In a major curricular innovation, ACS Athens established the ACS Athens Writing Project to promote the teaching of writing as a tool for learning across the disciplines in 1985. Two years later, ACS Athens was selected as a sponsor of an International Writing Project site, with ACS Athens teachers engaged in training teachers from international schools around the world in Writing Project theory and methods. The Carnegie Commission for Promoting Excellence in Education recognized the quality of the school's academic program by awarding ACS Athens two citations for excellence during the latter part of the decade. In 1986, ACS Athens closed the Kifissia Elementary School, and all school operations were consolidated at the Halandri campus, which had been expanded yet again with the building of new computer labs adjacent to the library. The purchase in 1988 of the public road which divided the campus allowed for the building of the central plaza which unified the campus. The closing of the American military bases during the 1992-93 school year, coupled with the Greek government's decision to allow Greek citizens to attend ACS Athens after completion of their compulsory education, resulted in yet another transformation in the complexion of the student body. While preserving its American character in philosophy and programs, ACS Athens, home to students representing over forty-five countries, was also ready to define itself as \\"The International School in Greece.\\" Another milestone in ACS Athens' history occurred in 2004, when ACS Athens was authorized by the Greek Ministry of Education to offer classes and examinations leading to awarding the Greek Apolytirio. The school is on one campus in the municipality of Halandri, at 129 Aghias Paraskevis Avenue. The student body is made up of over 1000 (2019-2020 data) students hailing from over 65 countries, and the school offers the American JK‚Äì12 curriculum, the International Baccalaureate IB Diploma, as well as a non-IB track, along with selected AP courses. Its faculty holds at least a master's degree and a number with PhDs. ACS Athens alumni include actor Greg Kinnear, producer Mark Wolper, astronaut Scott Parazynski, basketball player Rony Seikaly, and Congressman Jim Moody.

Like the Jedi Academy Trilogy, I, Jedi is notable in that it provides a detailed, first-hand look at the training of a Jedi Knight. The novel revisits many of the situations first presented by Anderson. Plot In I, Jedi, Corran Horn must develop his Jedi powers in order to save the life of his wife, Mirax Terrik. Corran Horn was a member of the elite X-wing force Rogue Squadron. After returning home from a long campaign to find his wife kidnapped, he turns to Luke Skywalker, the only remaining Jedi Master at the time, for help. This coincides nicely with the master's timing, as he is seeking students for his new Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. Corran knows that he is Force-sensitive, and that only with the Force as his ally can he track down his enemy. It turns out that Corran's wife, Mirax, was tracking down a group of elusive pirates known as the Invids. The Invids' primary tactic is to drop out of hyperspace with the flagship, an Imperial Star Destroyer named the Invidious, strike, and disappear with perfect timing. As she grew closer to solving the mystery of how these pirates performed their supernaturally accurate attacks, she was kidnapped and placed into stasis on their fortress planet. On the journey to save Mirax, Corran learns that his grandfather was a Jedi, a member of the Halcyon line. His adopted grandfather shows Corran the records that the Jedi had left behind, and with that, Corran eventually makes up his mind to follow in his ancestor's footsteps and become a Jedi. After extensive training and being caught in a crisis involving the risen spirit of the Dark Sith Lord Exar Kun, Corran goes as far as he can, and infiltrates the pirates using his CorSec training. He quickly rises through the ranks, and finds out where Mirax is being held. With the timely help of Luke Skywalker and his squadron friend and wingman, Ooryl Qrygg, he fights his way past the Jensaarai, a splinter group of Jedi who focus on stealth and premonition, and into the fortress, where he is able to rescue his wife.

During this time Lleweni Hall, the family's seat, expanded greatly after Sir John Salusbury was appointed the Custos Rotulorum of Denbighshire. Sir John, who was knighted in 1601, also had the distinction of being the dedicatee of Shakespeare's The Phoenix and the Turtle after Salusbury became his patron.

In 1929, the city, the state, and New York Central agreed on the West Side Improvement Project, conceived by Robert Moses), allocated funds for an elevated railway which would eliminate the grade crossings and alleviate the problems along Tenth and Eleventh Avenues; it also included construction of the West Side Elevated Highway. Meanwhile, the avenue's West End Avenue section was originally created in the 1880s as the northern extension of Eleventh Avenue, and was intended to be a commercial street serving the residents of the mansions to be constructed along Riverside Drive. When West End Avenue was named in the 1880s, the Upper West Side was fairly sparsely populated, and that upper portion of the avenue, subsequently, was called the \\"West End\\" because of its separation from the core of the city. Seeking to distinguish the area from the factories and tenements below 59th Street, a group of real estate developers renamed the northern portions of the West Side's avenues.Gray, Christopher. \\"How the West Side Was Won\\", The New York Times, May 13, 2007.

Between 34th and 59th Streets there are a number of new car dealerships including: Audi Manhattan, BMW of Manhattan, Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-Ram Manhattan, Jaguar-Land Rover Manhattan, Lexus of Manhattan, Manhattan Motorcars, Mercedes-Benz Manhattan, Mini of Manhattan, Open Road Volkswagen, Toyota of Manhattan, and Volvo Cars Manhattan. Additionally, numerous vehicle service stations, car washes, and car rental lots are found along this stretch. 381 to 389 West End Avenue, north end of Riverside-West End Historic District This area has served the transport trade for more than a hundred years; most of the stables for New York's remaining horse cabs are located on its side streets, though many now store taxis and pedicabs. It is not uncommon to hear the clip clop of horses in the vicinity, as a result. The carriage horses live in historic stables originally built in the 19th century, but today boast the latest in barn design, such as fans, misting systems, box stalls, and state-of-the-art sprinkler systems. As horses always have in densely populated urban areas, the carriage horses live upstairs in their stables while the carriages are parked below on the ground floor. =Historic districts= One historic district lies on Eleventh Avenue, the West Chelsea Historic District, designated in 2008.Brazee, Christopher D. and Most, Jennifer L. \\"West Chelsea Historic District Designatin Report\\" .

Early life Lessard was born in Anaheim, California, to musician Ron and Jacqueline Lessard. After moving a number of times during his childhood, Lessard and his family eventually settled in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1987. They had previously lived from 1980‚Äì84 in Buckingham County, Virginia and in Richmond, Virginia from 1984‚Äì86. Career After moving back to Charlottesville from Madison, Wi. in 1987, he enrolled in the Tandem Friends School, where he studied music under trumpeter John D'earth and bassist Peter Spaar. D'earth and Spaar recommended Lessard to Dave Matthews for inclusion in his new band, which was looking for a bassist. Lessard joined Dave Matthews Band just as it was forming, when he was sixteen years old. Due to his age, he sometimes had to sneak in the back door of the clubs where the band was playing due to prohibitions on persons under 21 entering venues that serve alcohol. Lessard completed his junior year of high school then took the GED (summer of '91) as he had already been accepted at Richmond's Virginia Commonwealth University in their Jazz Studies program. He left after six weeks, when it became evident that he could not be a full-time college student and simultaneously a touring member of a band with rising popularity. In 2006, Lessard began maintaining a MySpace page called LowenDude. He also owns and maintains a blog at izstyle.com. During the 2007 European Tour, Lessard also began a video blog on YouTube. On January 9, 2008, Lessard performed with members of Guster and Barenaked Ladies under the name Yukon Kornelius in a benefit concert sponsored by Okemo Mountain Resort, a ski resort in Vermont. Later that year, he co-wrote the original music for Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk.Greenhaus, Mike https://jambands.com/features/2008/03/22/3d-dmb-a-conversation-with-dave- matthews-bands-stefan-lessard/ Jambands.com  Personal life  Lessard married long-time girlfriend Josie Baucom in 1997. They had one son together, Elijah \\"Diggy\\" Diego (born January 9, 1998) and lost a daughter, Aslan, to SIDS in 1996. They divorced in 2004. In October 2005 he married Jaclyn Burton, and together they have three daughters, Hazel Bailey (born March 6, 2004), Flora Jude (born July 13, 2006), and India (born November 2015). On November 29, 2007, Lessard's home in western Albemarle County, Virginia, burned down, with a loss estimated at over 2 million dollars. It took over 40 firefighters from five different fire departments to extinguish the blaze. The origin of the fire is unknown, but the Albemarle County Fire Marshal's Office cites the structure's cedar shake siding as a contributor to the rapid spread of the fire. Lessard and his son were home at the time of the fire, though they escaped unharmed. Equipment Lessard plays a variety of bass guitars, including those made by Nordstrand, Modulus, Warwick, Ken Smith Basses, and hand-made Stambaugh Custom Basses. On the Dave Matthews Band album Busted Stuff, he plays piano, Hammond organ, and Dobro guitar.

Complexity in carbonization  A series of processes that involve carbonization. Carbonization is a pyrolytic reaction, therefore, is considered a complex process in which many reactions take place concurrently such as dehydrogenation, condensation, hydrogen transfer and isomerization. Carbonization differs from coalification in that it occurs much faster, due to its reaction rate being faster by many orders of magnitude. For the final pyrolysis temperature, the amount of heat applied controls the degree of carbonization and the residual content of foreign elements. For example, at T ‚àº 1200 K the carbon content of the residue exceeds a mass fraction of 90 wt.%, whereas at T ‚àº 1600 K more than 99 wt.% carbon is found. Carbonization is often exothermic, which means that it could in principle be made self- sustaining and be used as a source of energy that does not produce carbon dioxide. (See.\\"Burying biomass to fight climate change\\" by Richard Lovett, New Scientist, 3 May 2008, pp. 32-5.) In the case of glucose, the reaction releases about 237 calories per gram. When biomaterial is exposed to sudden searing heat (as in the case of a nuclear explosion or pyroclastic flow from a volcano, for instance), it can be carbonized extremely quickly, turning it into solid carbon. In the destruction of Herculaneum by a volcano, many organic objects such as furniture were carbonized by the intense heat.  How wood is transformed into charcoal  The carbonization of wood in an industrial setting usually requires a temperature above 280 ¬∞C, which liberates energy and hence this reaction is said to be exothermic. This carbonization, which can also be seen as a spontaneous breakdown of the wood, continues until only the carbonised residue called charcoal remains. Unless further external heat is provided, the process stops and the temperature reaches a maximum of about 400 ¬∞C. This charcoal, however, will still contain appreciable amounts of tarry residue, together with the ash of the original wood.  Industrial safety in carbonization  Carbonization produces substances which can prove harmful and simple precautions should be taken to reduce risks. The gas produced by carbonization has a high content of carbon monoxide which is poisonous when breathed. Therefore, when working around the kiln or pit during operation and when the kiln is opened for unloading, care must be taken that proper ventilation is provided to allow the carbon monoxide, which is also produced during unloading through spontaneous ignition of the hot fuel, to be dispersed. The tars and smoke produced from carbonization, although not directly poisonous, may have long-term damaging effects on the respiratory system. Housing areas should, where possible, be located so that prevailing winds carry smoke from charcoal operations away from them and batteries of kilns should not be located in close proximity to housing areas. Wood tars and pyroligneous acid can be irritant to skin and care should be taken to avoid prolonged skin contact by providing protective clothing and adopting working procedures which minimize exposure. The tars and pyroligneous liquors can also seriously contaminate streams and affect drinking water supplies for humans and animals. Fish may also be adversely affected. Liquid effluents and waste water from medium and large scale charcoal operations should be trapped in large settling ponds and allowed to evaporate so that this water does not pass into the local drainage system and contaminate streams. Kilns and pits, as distinct from retorts and other sophisticated systems, do not normally produce liquid effluent - the by- products are mostly dispersed into the air as vapours. Precautions against airborne contamination of the environment are of greater importance in this case.  Carbonization and biodiesel fuels  In one study,Green chemistry: Biodiesel made with sugar catalyst Masakazu Toda, Atsushi Takagaki, Mai Okamura, Junko N. Kondo, Shigenobu Hayashi, Kazunari Domen and Michikazu Hara Nature 438, 178 (10 November 2005) Abstract carbonization was used to create a new catalyst for the generation of biodiesel from ethanol and fatty acids. The catalyst was created by carbonization of simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose. The sugars were processed for 15 hours at 400 ¬∞C under a nitrogen flow to a black carbon residue consisting of a complex mixture of polycyclic aromatic carbon sheets. This material was then treated with sulfuric acid, which functionalized the sheets with sulfonite, carboxyl, and hydroxyl catalytic sites.

In some cases, the gambling is limited to slot machines, but many locations are beginning to include table games such as blackjack, poker, and roulette. In 2003, Joe Bob Briggs described the economic motivation of race track owners to convert into racinos: :Horse racing and dog racing have been in a slow decline for almost 20 years now....the only tracks that have really thrived are the ones that have slot machines. In many cases their live handle (the daily amount bet at the track by live customers) has continued to decline, but their revenues have shot up so fast that they're able to offer the biggest purses and thereby attract the best horses. Tracks like Delaware Park and West Virginia's Mountaineer Park, once considered places where local degenerates bet on broken-down nags in claiming races, are now among the wealthiest tracks around, with the best races. Fabled tracks like Pimlico, on the other hand, sometimes have trouble making ends meet. In the United States USA Today noted in a June 2003 article that receipts from slot machines are divided about evenly in four ways: * Payment of the operating costs and payouts to lucky gamblers, * State taxes, * Prize money (the purse) offered to jockeys and horse owners, and * Profit for the racino operator. As of 2013, racinos are legal in ten U.S. states: Delaware, Louisiana, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. The first racino in Pennsylvania opened in November 2006. West Virginia pioneered the concept when MTR Gaming Group was allowed to introduce video lottery terminals (VLTs) to the venue now known as Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort in Chester. Delaware, Rhode Island, and West Virginia, three of the members of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), jointly ran a progressive VLT game, Ca$hola, from 2006 to July 2011; the three lotteries began offering Ca$hola's successor, MegaHits, on July 15, 2011. While VLTs were somewhat successful, a November 2003 article from the Global Gaming Insider noted the real financial success story was the introduction of reel spinning slot machines in Iowa: :In 1994, Iowa voters authorized reel spinning slot machines at Iowa racetracks (including Greyhound tracks). Polk County, the owner of a brand new, bankrupt horse track, Prairie Meadows, spent $26 million to convert the clubhouse into a casino and install 1,100 slot machines. The racino opened for business on April 1, 1995. Reel-spinning slots proved to be much more popular than video poker. In the twelve months ended March 31, 1996 machine revenues totaled $119.3 million, enabling Polk County to pay off the $27 million bond issue that paid for the clubhouse casino conversion and retire the track's initial $38.8 million bond issue 17 years early. As the racino had increased revenues, horse racing purses increased six-fold, which attracted better horses to the racetrack and helped to develop horse breeding in Iowa. The Global Gaming Insider article also noted that the creation of the racino has led to consolidation in the ownership of racetracks, with Magna Entertainment Corporation (currently Stronach Group) and Churchill Downs Incorporated the largest. In November 2004, Florida voters amended their state constitution to allow slot machines at parimutuel facilities. In Bangor, Maine, a $131 million complex is under construction that will house, among other things, a gaming floor featuring up to 1,500 slot machines, a seven- story hotel, and a four-level parking garage. The new racino is slated to open in the summer of 2008. In Biddeford, Maine on November 2, 2010 by a vote of 59%-41% approved a referendum to relocate Scarborough Downs to Biddeford with a new Harness Racing Track/Racino Complex with Slot Machines, an Entertainment Complex and a 200 room Hotel. The plan is to have most if not all of the complex open sometime in 2012. Maine voters also approved the Oxford County Maine casino on Nov 2, 2010 also, the indications are that the Bangor Maine Racino and the possibly relocated Scarborough Downs Racino facility could also have table games as well. There are two racino-like facilities in Arkansas. The Oaklawn Jockey Club Racing Track, a horse track, is in Hot Springs. Southland Park, a greyhound track, is in West Memphis.

After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of Romania and fell within Odorhei County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the town was held by Hungary until the end of World War II. Following by the Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned in 1945 and it became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the town fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô-Magyar Autonomous Region.

History The Governor's Victory Bell was first presented in 1993 to commemorate Penn State's entry into the Big Ten Conference, with their first league game coming against Minnesota. Penn State won the trophy during the first four matchups, Minnesota the next four, and Penn State the next four after that. In 2008, Penn State recorded the first shutout of the series when they beat Minnesota 20‚Äì0; the previous low score for each team was 3 for Minnesota in 1994 and 7 for Penn State in 2004.

In 2010, after the University of Nebraska joined the Big Ten as its 12th member, the conference was split into two divisions. Penn State and Minnesota were placed in different divisions and thus, beginning in 2011, the rivalry would be held only four times every ten years. In 2014, the University of Maryland and Rutgers University joined the Big Ten and in 2016, the conference increased its schedule to nine games. Currently, the two schools will play each other at least twice during every six-year scheduling cycle. Penn State leads the series 9‚Äì6.

Formed in the late 1890s by \\"Circular Jack\\", \\"Kid Yorke\\", and \\"Goo Goo Knox\\", the gang began operating from an apartment house on Hudson Street. Knox, a former member of the Gopher Gang, had fled after a failed attempt to gain leadership of the gang from then-leader Marty Brennan. However the two gangs later became allies during the gang wars against Gay Nineties gangs, the Potashes and Boodle Gangs, soon controlling most of Manhattan's West Side as far as 13th Street and eastern Broadway, bordering Paul Kelly's Five Points Gang to the north. While the gang dominated the West Side, it constantly battled smaller rival gangs including the Fashion Plates, the Pearl Buttons, and the Marginals for control of the Hudson River docks throughout the 1900s. Eventually, it drove the rival gangs out through sheer force of numbers, with over 200 members, not including the Gophers, who numbered several hundred more, controlling the waterfront by 1910. The gang, now a dominant force in New York, included the likes of Charles \\"Red\\" Farrell, Mike Costello, \\"Rubber\\" Shaw, Rickey Harrison, and \\"Honey\\" Stewart. The gang became involved in election fraud as they were hired out by Tammany Hall politicians in exchange for political protection. A colorful member by the name of Ding Dong organized a push cart theft ring whereby he had a group of apprentice gang members toss packages to him from a passing wagon, distracting the police. Soon the gang began to be noticed by the press as reporters met members in Greenwich Village tavern hangouts, becoming glamorized by the city. They came to represent the bohemian spirit of the area. According to author Luc Sante, activist Dorothy Day, by her own admission, spent much of her youth partying with the Dusters in Greenwich Village. Many of the gang's members, including most of its leaders, had become drug addicts and were known for their wild \\"cocaine parties\\" in which the gang wandered the city afterwards in a drugged state committing violent acts. One victim of these attacks was Gopher member Owney Madden, who was shot six times outside the Arbor Dance Hall on November 6, 1914, resulting in the deaths of three of the gang members less than a week later. With the gang's political connections to Tammany Hall, the police remained inactive. However, the gang frequently moved its headquarters to avoid police raids by \\"strong arm squads\\". The gang, which regularly demanded goods from local merchants, soon attracted the unwanted attention of the police after an incident in which the gang destroyed a saloon after its owner refused to deliver six barrels of beer to a gang party. The saloon keeper reported this to his friend Dennis Sullivan, a patrolman from the Charles Street station, who arrested Farrell and ten other members at a local pool hall for vagrancy. The gang retaliated, luring Sullivan into the neighborhood onto the premises of a local merchant, who had been forced to make a complaint against a member of the gang. When Sullivan arrived he was attacked by approximately twenty members and severely beaten, eventually losing consciousness. He was stripped of his uniform and his badge was thrown into a sewer drain. As the gang fled, five members remained behind to jump on Sullivan's back and to kick him in the face repeatedly before a police \\"flying squad\\" arrived. Hospitalized for over a month the incident was immortalized in a poem by Gopher leader \\"One Leg\\" Curran: The gang liked the poem so much they had it printed on thousands of sheets and distributed throughout the neighborhood as well as the Charles Street Station and the hospital where Sullivan was recovering. The song grew to be so popular that many juvenile gangs would often sing the tune on the street. By 1914 however, with most of its leaders in jail or dead from drug overdoses, the remainder of the gang were driven from their territory by the Marginals under Tanner Smith, who after defeating the Pearl Buttons would assume control for the next decade. The last members of the gang were eventually arrested by police during their clearing of gangs from Manhattan in 1916. Members * Circular Jack * Kid Yorke * Frank \\"Goo Goo\\" Knox (died August 26, 1921) : A West Side gunman, Knox had a lengthy criminal career, spending time in the House of Refuge for disorderly conduct in 1912, the New York State Reformatory for felonious assault in 1914, and Elmira Reformatory for grand larceny in 1916. In 1918, he was taken into custody at Jersey City and charged with draft dodging but was released on probation. He was killed by John Hudson in what police suspected was a dispute over bootlegging. He was believed by authorities to have ceased criminal activities for two years before his body was found on the sidewalk of 52nd Street. Hudson later died of a morphine overdose at Bellevue Hospital under mysterious circumstances. * Charles \\"Red\\" Farrell (born 1851) : A longtime burglar and pickpocket, Farrell would be in and out of prison from 1883 onwards. By the time of his ninth and final arrest in August 1922, the 71-year-old thief was one of the oldest pickpockets operating in the city and was sentenced to six month imprisonment for \\"jostling\\". * Mike Costello * Robert \\"Rubber\\" Shaw (died July 31, 1919) : One of the later gang leaders, Shaw was gunned down in a drive-by shooting while standing on a street corner with George Lewis in Hoboken on July 31, 1919. His death is thought to have been in revenge for the murder of rival gang leader Thomas \\"Tanner\\" Smith of the Marginals only five days before. *Richard \\"Rickey\\" Harrison (c. 1893 ‚Äì May 13, 1920) : A prominent member during the early 1900s, Harrison survived an attempt on his life while imprisoned in The Tombs when he was stabbed in November 1914, and refused to identify his attacker while recovering in Bellevue Hospital. Later arrested for the robbery of the Knickerbocker Waiters Club on September 7, 1918 (during which a visiting Canadian soldier, George Griffelns, was killed), he escaped from The Tombs on October 4. However he was recaptured by detectives in Newark on October 16. Eventually extradited to New York, despite appeals to the US Supreme Court, he was convicted of murder and armed robbery for which he was executed by the electric chair in Sing Sing Prison on May 13, 1920. * \\"Honey\\" Stewart * William \\"Brother Mac\\" McNamara : While still a teenager, McNamara took part in a murder-for-hire plot in January 1916, in which he and another man, known only as \\"Dutch,\\" attacked and fatally injured a gardener named Gregorio George in Dobbs Ferry, NY, on behalf of George's wife, who was in love with another man. That June, McNamara was tried in White Plains for the murder, convicted, and sentenced to death. The following year, in June 1917, his death sentence was commuted by Governor Whitman to life in prison.

He was born in York, in August 1820. Career Though only 24, in August 1844 Middleton gained his first contract and was asked to design Cleveland Lodge, an impressive mansion situated directly beneath Roseberry Topping. He was then employed as a retained architect for the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR;), and built stations and railway buildings for a number of lines, including the Wear and Derwent Junction Railway (1845), the Middlesbrough and Redcar Railway (1846) and finally the recently re-opened Weardale Railway (1847). He moved to Cheltenham in 1859 where he designed five Anglican churches, which were All Saints', Holy Apostles, St. Mark's, St. Philip & St. James and St. Stephen's Churches. This move to Cheltenham brought Middleton to the attention of a number of landed gentry in Wales. It was Middleton who designed the Cilgwyn Mansion in Newcastle Emlyn for the Fitzwilliam family in 1884 and it was at Cilgwyn that he died in 1885. It is said locally that his death occurred at the mansion whilst disputing some aspect of the building work on the mansion. It was also Middleton's company that was contracted to build the Canterbury building at the University of Wales, Lampeter, though this was opened in 1887, and as such it is unlikely that Middleton had a great deal direct input on this building, since he died in Wales in 1885. Personal life Middleton married Maria Margaret Pritchett, daughter of James Pigott Pritchett, architect of York, and his first wife Peggy Maria Terry. Their only surviving child John Henry Middleton (1846‚Äì1896) was appointed director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1893.

They are the main component of biological membranes. Structures The term glycerophospholipid signifies any derivative of glycerophosphoric acid that contains at least one O-acyl, or O-alkyl, or O-alk-1'-enyl residue attached to the glycerol moiety. The alcohol here is glycerol, to which two fatty acids and a phosphoric acid are attached as esters. The two fatty acid chains attached to the molecule of glycerol are nonpolar hence hydrophobic while the polar heads which mainly consists of the phosphate group attached to the third carbon of the glycerol molecule is hydrophilic. This dual characteristic leads to the amphipathic nature of glycerophospholipids. They are usually organized into a bilayer in membranes with the polar hydrophillic heads sticking outwards to the aqueous environment and the non polar hydrophobic tails pointing inwards. Glycerophospholipids consists of various diverse species which usually differ slightly in structure. The most basic structure is a phosphatidate. This species is an important intermediate in the synthesis of many phosphoglycerides. The presence of an additional group attached to the phosphate allows for many different phosphoglycerides. By convention, structures of these compounds show the 3 glycerol carbon atoms vertically with the phosphate attached to carbon atom number three (at the bottom). Plasmalogens and phosphatidates are examples. Nomenclature and stereochemistry In general, glycerophospholipids use a \\"sn\\" notation, which stands for stereospecific numbering. When the letters \\"sn\\" appear in the nomenclature, by convention the hydroxyl group of the second carbon of glycerol (2-sn) is on the left on a Fischer projection. The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom. The advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3. For example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn- glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers. Most vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position. Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position. Examples ;Plasmalogens Plasmalogens are a type of phosphoglyceride. The first carbon of glycerol has a hydrocarbon chain attached via an ether, not ester, linkage. The linkages are more resistant to chemical attack than ester linkages are. The second (central) carbon atom has a fatty acid linked by an ester. The third carbon links to an ethanolamine or choline by means of a phosphate ester. These compounds are key components of the membranes of muscles and nerves. ;Phosphatidates Phosphatidates are lipids in which the first two carbon atoms of the glycerol are fatty acid esters, and the 3 is a phosphate ester. The phosphate serves as a link to another alcohol- usually ethanolamine, choline, serine, or a carbohydrate. The identity of the alcohol determines the subcategory of the phosphatidate. There is a negative charge on the phosphate and, in the case of choline or serine, a positive quaternary ammonium ion. (Serine also has a negative carboxylate group.) The presence of charges give a \\"head\\" with an overall charge. The phosphate ester portion (\\"head\\") is hydrophilic, whereas the remainder of the molecule, the fatty acid \\"tail\\", is hydrophobic. These are important components for the formation of lipid bilayers. Phosphatidylethanoamines, phosphatidylcholines, and other phospholipids are examples of phosphatidates. ;Phosphatidylcholines Phosphatidylcholines are lecithins. Choline is the alcohol, with a positively charged quaternary ammonium, bound to the phosphate, with a negative charge. Lecithins are present in all living organisms. An egg yolk has a high concentration of lecthins- which are commercially important as an emulsifying agent in products such as mayonnaise. Lecithins are also present in brain and nerve tissue. ;Other phospholipids There are many other phospholipids, some of which are glycolipids. The glycolipids include phosphatidyl sugars where the alcohol functional group is part of a carbohydrate. Phosphatidyl sugars are present in plants and certain microorganisms. A carbohydrate is very hydrophilic due to the large number of hydroxyl groups present. Uses =Functions and use in membranes= One of the main functions of glycerophospholipid is to serve as a structural component of biological membranes. Their amphipathic nature drives the formation of the lipid bilayer structure of membranes. The cell membrane seen under the electron microscope consists of two identifiable layers, or \\"leaflets\\", each of which is made up of an ordered row of glycerophospholipid molecules. The composition of each layer can vary widely depending on the type of cell. * For example, in human erythrocytes the cytosolic side (the side facing the cytosol) of the plasma membrane consists mainly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol. * By contrast, the exoplasmic side (the side on the exterior of the cell) consists mainly of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, a type of sphingolipid. Each glycerophospholipid molecule consists of a small polar head group and two long hydrophobic chains. In the cell membrane, the two layers of phospholipids are arranged as follows: * the hydrophobic tails point to each other and form a fatty, hydrophobic center * the ionic head groups are placed at the inner and outer surfaces of the cell membrane This is a stable structure because the ionic hydrophilic head groups interact with the aqueous media inside and outside the cell, whereas the hydrophobic tails maximize hydrophobic interactions with each other and are kept away from the aqueous environments. The overall result of this structure is to construct a fatty barrier between the cell's interior and its surroundings. Apart from their function in cell memberanes, they function in other cellular processes such as signal induction and transport. In regards to signaling, they provide the precursors for prostanglandins and other leukotrienes. It is their specific distribution and catabolism that enables them carry out the biological response processes listed above. Their roles as storage centers for secondary messengers in the membrane is also a contributing factor to their ability to act as transporters. They also influence protein function. For example, they are important constituents of lipoproteins (soluble proteins that transport fat in the blood) hence affect their metabolism and function. =Use in emulsification= Glycerophospholipids can also act as an emulsifying agent to promote dispersal of one substance into another. This is sometimes used in candy making and ice- cream making. =In the brain= Neural membranes contain several classes of glycerophospholipids which turnover at different rates with respect to their structure and localization in different cells and membranes. There are three major classes namely; 1-alkyl-2-acyl glycerophospholipid, 1,2-diacyl glycerophospholipid and plasmalogen. The main function of these classes of glycerophospholipids in the neural membranes is to provide stability, permeability and fluidity through specific alterations in their compositions. The glycerophospholipid composition of neural membranes greatly alters their functional efficacy. The length of glycerophospholipid acyl chain and the degree of saturation are important determinants of many membrane characteristics including the formation of lateral domains that are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Receptor-mediated degradation of glycerophospholipids by phospholipases A(l), A(2), C, and D results in generation of second messengers, such as prostaglandins, eicosanoids, platelet activating factor and diacylglycerol. Thus, neural membrane phospholipids are a reservoir for second messengers. They are also involved in apoptosis, modulation of activities of transporters, and membrane-bound enzymes. Marked alterations in neural membrane glycerophospholipid composition have been reported to occur in neurological disorders. These alterations result in changes in membrane fluidity and permeability. These processes along with the accumulation of lipid peroxides and compromised energy metabolism may be responsible for the neurodegeneration observed in neurological disorders. Metabolism The metabolism of glycerophospholipids is different in eukaryotes, tumor cells, and prokaryotes. Synthesis in prokaryotes involves the synthesis of glycerophospholipids phosphatidic acid and polar head groups. Phosphatidic acid synthesis in eukaryotes is different, there are two routes, one to the other toward phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Glycerophospholipids are generally metabolized in several steps with different intermediates. The very first step in this metabolism involves the addition or transfer of the fatty acid chains to the glycerol backbone to form the first intermediate, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA then becomes acylated to form the next intermediate phosphatidic acid (PA). PA can be dephosphorylated leading to the formation of diacylglycerol which is essential in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). PC is one of the many species of glycerophospholipids. In a pathway called the Kennedy pathway, the polar heads are added to complete the formation of the entire structure consisting of the polar head regions, the two fatty acid chains and the phosphate group attached to the glycerol backbone.

The shelling of the Sarajevo market place on 28 August 1995 by the VRS is considered to be the immediate instigating factor behind NATO's decision to launch the operation. The operation was carried out between 30 August and 20 September 1995, involving 400 aircraft and 5,000 personnel from 15 nations. Commanded by Admiral Leighton W. Smith Jr., the campaign struck 338 Bosnian Serb targets, many of which were destroyed. Overall, 1,026 bombs were dropped during the operation, 708 of which were precision-guided. The bombing campaign was also roughly conterminous in time with Operation Mistral 2, two linked military offensives of the Croatian Army (HV), the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) launched in western Bosnia. Background The Bosnian War was an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1 April 1992 and 14 December 1995. After popular pressure, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was asked by the United Nations to intervene in the Bosnian War after allegations of war crimes against civilians were made. In response to the refugee and humanitarian crisis in Bosnia, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 743 on 21 February 1992, creating the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The UNPROFOR mandate was to keep the population alive and deliver humanitarian aid to refugees in Bosnia until the war ended. On 9 October 1992, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 781, prohibiting unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This resolution led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone, but it did not take action against violators of the resolution. On 31 March 1993, in response to 500 documented violations, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 816, which authorized states to use measures \\"to ensure compliance\\" with the no-fly zone over Bosnia. In response, on 12 April, NATO initiated Operation Deny Flight, which was tasked with enforcing the no-fly zone and allowed to engage the violators of the no- fly zone. However, Serb forces on the ground continued to attack UN \\"safe areas\\" in Bosnia, and the UN peacekeepers were unable to fight back as the mandate did not give them authority to do so. On 4 June, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 836 authorizing the use of force by UNPROFOR in the protection of specially designated safe zones. Operation Sharp Guard, a naval blockade in the Adriatic Sea by NATO and the Western European Union, was approved at a joint session of NATO and the WEU on 8 June and began on 15 June. On 6 February 1994, a day after the first Markale marketplace massacre, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali formally requested NATO to confirm that air strikes would be carried out immediately. On 9 February, agreeing to the request of the UN, NATO authorized the Commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH), US Admiral Jeremy Boorda, to launch air strikes against artillery and mortar positions in and around Sarajevo that were determined by UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets. Only Greece failed to support the use of air strikes, but it did not veto the proposal. The council also issued an ultimatum at the 9 February meeting to the Bosnian Serbs, in which they demanded that the Serbs remove their heavy weapons around Sarajevo by midnight of 20‚Äì21 February or face air strikes. There was some confusion surrounding compliance with the ultimatum, and Hungarian Prime Minister P√©ter Boross announced that Hungary's air space would be closed to NATO aircraft in the event of air strikes. On 12 February 1994, Sarajevo enjoyed its first casualty-free day in 22 months (since April 1992). On 28 February, the scope of NATO involvement in Bosnia increased dramatically. In an incident near Banja Luka, NATO fighters operating under Deny Flight shot down four Bosnian Serb fighters for violating a no-fly zone. This was the first combat operation in the history of NATO and opened the door for a steadily growing NATO role in Bosnia. On 12 March, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) made its first request for NATO air support, but close air support was not deployed, owing to a number of delays associated with the approval process. On 10 and 11 April 1994, UNPROFOR called in air strikes to protect the Gora≈æde safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Gora≈æde by two US F-16 jets. This was the first time in NATO's history it had ever attacked ground targets with aircraft. Subsequently, the Bosnian Serbs took 150 UN personnel hostage on 14 April. On 16 April, a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Gora≈æde by Bosnian Serb forces. Around 29 April, a Danish contingent (Nordbat 2) on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia, as part of UNPROFOR's Nordic battalion located in Tuzla, was ambushed when trying to relieve a Swedish observation post (Tango 2) that was under heavy artillery fire by the Bosnian Serb ≈†ekoviƒái brigade at the village of Kalesija, but the ambush was dispersed when the UN forces retaliated with heavy fire in what would be known as Operation B√∏llebank. On 5 August, at the request of the UNPROFOR, two US A-10 Thunderbolts located and strafed a Bosnian Serb anti-tank vehicle near Sarajevo after the Serbs tested NATO's resolve by seizing weapons that had been impounded by UN troops and attacking a UN helicopter. Afterwards, the Serbs agreed to return the remaining heavy weapons. On 22 September 1994, NATO aircraft carried out an air strike against a Bosnian Serb tank at the request of UNPROFOR. On 25‚Äì26 May 1995, after violations of the exclusion zones and the shelling of safe areas, NATO aircraft carried out air strikes against Bosnian Serb ammunition depots in Pale. In retaliation, the Bosnian Serbs took 370 UN peacekeepers in Bosnia hostage and subsequently used them as human shields at potential targets in a successful bid to prevent further air strikes. On 2 June, two US Air Force F-16 jets were sent on patrol over Bosnia in support of Operation Deny Flight. While on patrol, an F-16 piloted by Captain Scott O'Grady was shot down by a Bosnian Serb 2K12 Kub surface-to-air missile. O'Grady was forced to eject from the aircraft. Six days later, he was rescued by US marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit from . The event would come to be known as the Mrkonjiƒá Grad incident. On 11 July, NATO aircraft attacked targets in the Srebrenica area of Bosnia and Herzegovina as identified by and under the control of the United Nations. This was in response to Bosnian Serb forces advancing on the UN-declared Safe Area of Srebrenica. Bosnian Serb warlord Ratko Mladiƒá threatened to kill 50 UN peacekeepers who were seized as hostages and also threatened to shell the Muslim population in Srebrenica if NATO air strikes continued. The UN peacekeepers called off the air strikes and agreed to withdraw from Srebrenica as the Bosnian Serbs promised they would take care of the Muslim population for the peacekeepers to spare their own lives. For two weeks, VRS forces under Mladiƒá killed over 8,000 Bosniaks, mainly men and boys, in the Srebrenica massacre, which remains the worst act of genocide in Europe since World War II. On 25 July, the North Atlantic Council authorized military planning aimed at deterring an attack on the safe area of Gora≈æde, and threatened the use of NATO air power if this safe area was threatened or attacked. On 1 August, the Council took similar decisions aimed at deterring attacks on the safe areas of Sarajevo, Bihaƒá, and Tuzla. On 4 August, NATO aircraft conducted air strikes against Croat Serb air defense radars near Udbina airfield and Knin in Croatia. On 10 August, the Commanders of Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH) and UNPROFOR concluded a memorandum of understanding on the execution of air strikes. Campaign On 30 August, the Secretary General of NATO announced the start of air strikes, supported by UNPROFOR rapid reaction force artillery attacks. Although planned and approved by the North Atlantic Council in July 1995, the operation was triggered in direct response to the second Markale massacre on 28 August 1995. As many as 400 NATO aircraft participated in the air campaign. Overall, 3,515 sorties were flown and a total of 1,026 bombs were dropped on 338 Bosnian Serb targets located within 48 complexes. NATO aircraft struck 97% of their targets, and seriously damaged more than 80% of them. 708 of the bombs dropped were precision-guided munitions. The aircraft involved in the campaign operated from Aviano Air Base, Italy, and from the US aircraft carriers and , and French aircraft carriers Foch and Clemenceau (rotating) in the Adriatic Sea. The VRS integrated air defence network, comprising aircraft and surface- to-air missiles (SAMs), presented a high-threat environment to NATO air operations. Image taken by a US aircraft upon hitting a Bosnian Serb target The German Luftwaffe saw action for the first time since 1945 during Operation Deliberate Force. Six interdictor-strike (IDS) version Tornados, equipped with infrared recce devices and escorted by eight ECR Tornados, pinpointed Serb targets around Sarajevo for the Rapid Reaction Force artillery. The Rapid Reaction Force Frustrated by the previous absence of results and the resistance of the Serbian parties to any peace progress, the Western powers, led by French President Jacques Chirac, decided to set up a strong and deterrent force on site in order to support the western diplomatic efforts. France, The United Kingdom and the US decided to send a multinational brigade to the Sarajevo area (Mount Igman), supported by an airmobile brigade and an armored battalion in reserve. The MN Brigade consisted of 4000 military (2000 French, 1500 British, 500 Dutch). The creation of the Force was authorized by UN Resolution 998 on 16 June 1995. Commanded by French General Andre Soubirou, the MN brigade was operational in August 1995 on Mount Igman. The main force consisted of a mixed artillery regiment (French artillery group with eight 155 mm AUF1 howitzer AUF1, British artillery group with twelve 105 mm Light Guns, French and Dutch 120 mm Heavy Mortar company). Although the artillery fired before and after the Markale Market Massacre, the main action was on 28 and 29 August 1995, firing 1070 shells on Serbian positions (305 155mm shell, 408 120mm shell, 357 105 mm shells). This artillery group was part of the UNPROFOR deployed on Mount Igman to support the task of NATOs aircraft by pounding Serb artillery positions. On 30 August, a French Mirage 2000N was shot down by a Bosnian Serb shoulder-fired SAM near Pale. On 1 September, NATO and UN demanded the lifting of the Serb's Siege of Sarajevo, removal of heavy weapons from the heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and complete security of other UN safe areas. NATO stopped the air raids and gave an ultimatum to Bosnian Serb leaders. The deadline was set as 4 September. On 5 September 1995, NATO resumed air attacks on Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo and near the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale after the Bosnian Serbs failed to comply with the ultimatum. On the night of 10 September, the launched a Tomahawk missile strike from the central Adriatic Sea against a key air defense radio relay tower at Lisina, near Banja Luka, while US Air Force F-15E and US Navy F/A-18 fighter-bombers hit the same targets with about a dozen precision-guided bombs, and F-16 jets attacked with Maverick missiles. On 14 September, NATO air strikes were suspended to allow the implementation of an agreement with Bosnian Serbs, to include the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone. The initial 72-hour suspension was eventually extended to 114 hours. Finally on 20 September, General Bernard Janvier (Commander, UNPF) and Admiral Leighton W. Smith, Jr. (CINCSOUTH) agreed that the resumption of air strikes was not necessary as Bosnian Serbs had complied with the conditions set out by the UN and as a result the operation was terminated. The air campaign was the key to pressuring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to take part in negotiations that resulted in the Dayton Agreement, reached in November 1995. Aftermath The two French airmen who were captured after their Mirage 2000N was downed by Bosnian Serb forces on 30 August 1995, Lt. Jose Souvignet and Capt. Frederic Chiffot, were released only upon the end of the Bosnian War, on 12 December 1995. Upon being released, they told reporters that they had been treated well while in captivity. In December 1995, NATO dispatched a 60,000-strong peacekeeping force into Bosnia as part of the IFOR to enforce the Dayton Peace Agreement to secure peace and prevent renewed hostilities between three warring factions. In December 1996, the NATO-led SFOR was established to replace the IFOR to enforce the Dayton Peace Agreement. This lasted up until December 2004, when the EUFOR Althea replaced the NATO-led SFOR.

Early life He was born Afanasy Mikhaylovich Shorokhov (), into a peasant family in the village of Larikha, in central Siberia. Petrov joined the Komsomol in 1923 and the Soviet Navy.  Intelligence career  According to his recently released secret British MI5 file, Petrov stated during his post-defection interviewing that his intelligence career was as follows: * 1929‚Äì1933 cypher clerk Soviet Navy. * 1933‚Äì1938 NKVD Moscow dealing with overseas cypher communications. * 1939 NKVD cypher clerk attached to Soviet Army Western China. * 1940‚Äì1942 NKVD cypher clerk Moscow dealing with Internal communications. * 1942‚Äì1947 NKVD cypher clerk Sweden with additional Internal Security duties. * 1947‚Äì1951 MGB Moscow dealing with seamen on the Danube. * 1951‚Äì1954 MGB controller in Australia. Petrov also gave information about the defection of Burgess and Maclean of the Cambridge Five. Their escape had been handled by Kislitsyn, an MGB officer who was in Australia when Petrov defected in 1954. Petrov also disclosed that Burgess and Maclean were living in Kuibyshev in 1954. (National Archives Reference:kv/2/3440) Joining OGPU He decided to join the Soviet spy organization, the OGPU, in May 1933. He was subsequently admitted to the Special Cipher Section, which was attached to the Foreign Department of the OGPU. It was his status in this section which allowed him to learn many Soviet secrets by reading the top secret ciphers. Petrov lived through the purges of Stalin under Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria. Even though a great number of his friends, colleagues, and superiors were arrested and executed, Petrov escaped unscathed. Australia and defection Having graduated from cipher clerk to full-fledged agent, Petrov was sent to Australia by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) in 1951. His job there was to recruit spies and to keep watch on Soviet citizens, making sure that none of the Soviets abroad defected. Ironically, it was in Australia where events would occur which led to his own defection from the USSR. This came about through his association with Polish-born doctor and musician Michael Bialoguski, who played along in seeming to allow Petrov to recruit him to gather information, while at the same time reporting to Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on Petrov's activities. Petrov applied for political asylum in 1954, on the grounds that he could provide information regarding a Soviet spy ring operating out of the Soviet Embassy in Australia. Petrov states in his memoirs (ghost written by Michael Thwaites) that his reasoning for defecting lay not in an imminent fear of being executed, but in his disillusionment with the Soviet system and his own experiences and knowledge of the terror and human suffering inflicted on the Soviet people by their government. He witnessed the destruction of the Siberian village in which he was born, caused by forced collectivization and the famine which resulted. Life after defection Petrov became an Australian citizen in 1956. He and his wife Evdokia's names were changed to Sven and Maria Anna Allyson. They lived a quiet suburban life in Melbourne. He died in 1991, and she died in 2002. The whereabouts of the Petrovs were still the subject of a D-Notice in 1982.

The band formed in 1976 in Yl√∂j√§rvi, a small town near Tampere. The band is the best- selling music artist in Finland, with certified sales of nearly two million records, and it has also gained success especially in the use of the Finnish language in rock lyrics. In addition to their studio albums, Eppu Normaali also released live records, DVDs, and over 20 singles. Eppu Normaali's most famous songs include \\"Vuonna '85\\" (In the Year '85), \\"Kitara, taivas ja t√§hdet\\" (The Guitar, the Sky and the Stars), \\"Murheellisten laulujen maa\\" (Land of Sad Songs), \\"Pimeyden tango\\" (Tango of Darkness), \\"Suolaista sadetta\\" (Salty Rain) and \\"Tahroja paperilla\\" (Stains on Paper). History The members of the original band were Juha Torvinen (guitar), Mikko Saarela (bass), Aku Syrj√§ (drums), and brothers Martti Syrj√§ (vocals) and Mikko \\"Pantse\\" Syrj√§ (guitar). (The brothers are the sons of accomplished writers Kirsi Kunnas and Jaakko Syrj√§).Europopmusic's Eppu Normaali profile In 1979, bassist Mikko Saarela left the band, and Mikko Nevalainen played bass with Eppu Normaali until 1989. The current bassist is Sami Ruusukallio. The band took its name from a character in the Mel Brooks movie Young Frankenstein, and the subtitler translated the name of the character Abby Normal (abnormal) into the Finnish equivalent Eppu Normaali (ep√§normaali, roughly 'abnormal'; a Finnish equivalent of the original play with words). In 1977, the band participated in a local rock music competition. Finnish folk/pop legend Juice Leskinen was present and issued a demand that they \\"must win\\", but the judges were unimpressed‚Äîthe band did not win. The band began sending demos to various record companies and they were soon signed to Poko Rekords. They initially released albums in a punk pop style that gained favourable reviews, but the band did not gain mainstream acceptance until 1984 with what had evolved into a more AOR-oriented music style. Rupisia Riimej√§ Karmeita Tarinoita was released in 1984, and it was followed by Kahdeksas Ihme in 1985 and Valkoinen Kupla in 1986. This trio of albums were all hits, with combined sales of over 300,000 copies. Kahdeksas Ihme is their top-selling non-greatest hits record to date. Although their albums all sold well, the band decided to take a break in 1989 after intensive tours around the country and when Mikko Nevalainen left the group. In 1993, they released Studio Etana, which was to become their last studio album for eleven years. The band came close to breaking up, citing \\"lacking inspiration\\" as the primary cause. Their 1996 release Repullinen hittej√§, a greatest hits compilation sold over 240,000 copies,Finnish Charts reaching the top of the Finnish charts. This record also stayed on the charts for over two years, a duration which is second of all time in Finland. After its release, the band effectively stopped touring or performing live. In 2004, the band announced they would record a new album, Sadan vuoden p√§√§st√§kin, which became one of the band's most successful releases.

His two terms focused largely on internal improvements, culminating in the passage of the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act, which was viewed at the time as his crowning achievement. His taxing recommendations to pay for the improvements were not fully enacted, and the project ultimately led the state to negotiate a partial bankruptcy only a few years later. The debacle led to a gradual collapse of the state Whig party, which never regained control of the government, and led to a period of Democratic control that lasted until the middle of the American Civil War. After his term as governor he was appointed to the Board of Internal Improvement where he unsuccessfully advocated a reorganization of the projects in an attempt to gain some benefit from them. Early life =Family and background= Noah Noble was born in Berryville, Virginia, on January 15, 1794, one of fourteen children of Dr. Thomas Noble and Elizabeth Clair Sedgwick Noble. Around 1800, his family moved to the frontier where his father opened a medical practice in Campbell County, Kentucky. In 1807, the family moved again to Boone County where his father acquired a plantation which was operated by slave labor. Noble moved to Brookville, Indiana, around 1811 at age seventeen, following his brother James Noble, who had moved there some time earlier. James was a prominent lawyer and later United States Senator.Gugin, p. 70 In Indiana he made several business ventures with his partner Enoch D. John. Together they operated a hotel in Brookville, became heavily involved in land speculation, and opened a water-powered weaving mill with a wool carding machine. Noble also opened a trading company called N. Noble & Company. The company purchased produce from area farmers and shipped it to New Orleans to be sold. In 1819 a boating accident destroyed one of his shipments and left him with a large debt that took several years to repay. Later that year he married his cousin, Catherin Stull van Swearingen. The two shared the same great-grandfather. They had three children, but only one survived into adulthood; two died as infants.Gugin, p. 71 =Entry into politics= Noble entered politics in 1820, winning an election to become Franklin County's sheriff. By the time of his 1822 reelection bid he had become very popular in the county, and he won reelection 1,186 to 9 votes. He was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 7th Regiment of the Indiana militia in 1817, and a colonel in 1820. When his term as sheriff expired, he ran to represent the county in the Indiana House of Representatives, winning overwhelmingly. He was reelected again the following year but resigned following the death of his brother Lazarus. Lazarus had been the Receiver of Public Moneys of the Indianapolis Land Office, and his death left a vacancy. His brother, Senator James Noble, used his influence to secure the post for Noble, who remained in the position until 1829. The job took him to Indianapolis, where he was responsible for collecting revenue for the federal government. The position brought him into contact with many of the leading men in the state and he was quick to create good relationships with them. Following the election of President Andrew Jackson and the employment of the spoils system, Noble was removed from the position.Woollen, p. 65 Finding himself without a job, Noble launched another business venture. Before he could open the new business, his friends in the Indiana General Assembly appointed him to a commission that was responsible for laying out the Michigan Road. He remained on the commission until 1831, at which time he announced his candidacy for governor of Indiana as a Whig candidate, and secured the Whig nomination.Gugin, p. 72 Governor During the campaign, he accused his Democratic opponent James G. Read of being ineligible to run because he was a Federal Receiver. The state constitution forbade state officials from holding both federal and state positions simultaneously. His opponent made a similar charge against Noble, who still held his position as a federal commissioner working on the Michigan Road. Noble campaigned heavily on the internal improvement platform and won the election by a plurality of 23,518 votes to Read's 21,002, with independent Milton Stapp taking 6,894. After becoming governor he purchased several lots on the eastern edge of the capitol, planting an orchard and vineyard and building a large brick home. He brought some of his father's emancipated slaves with him to work in his household, one of whom was supposedly the model for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom. She visited Noble's home on more than one occasion.Gugin, p. 73 =First term= Third Indiana Statehouse Indiana was continuing to experience a period of prosperity as a large influx of settlers purchased land, thereby providing a large income for the government. Noble's predecessor had begun the framework for the large-scale internal improvements that were to come, but had significantly delayed the start of the canal projects. Noble set to work immediately and within a few months he completed surveying the route of the Wabash and Erie Canal and made several recommendations regarding its construction. Noble was opposed to railroads, which he viewed as monopolies since only the rail company could transport goods on the line, whereas canals were open to anyone had a boat. Construction on the canal began in earnest in 1832. Construction on state roads was progressing slowly because of a lack of funding. Noble proposed the state borrow money to speed the construction process, but the legislature rejected his proposal. He also recommended the creation of an Internal Improvement Board to coordinate the projects and possibly reduce costs through better organization and purchase of supplies in bulk, but again the General Assembly rejected the proposal, and instead kept the projects operating under several different project boards. His first term passed with little advancement on the internal improvement front because the representatives from southern part of the state blocked any large-scale plans on the grounds that such projects would have little value for their constituents since most of the projects would be in the central part of the state. Noble had a census conducted and recommended that the legislature reapportion representation to grant more seats to the central counties. The legislature approved the plan, and expanded the Senate and House of Representatives to their present sizes of 50 and 100 seats, respectively. The change gave the central and northern parts of the state more representatives than the south for the first time, despite the fact that the south was still significantly more populous. Noble made several recommendations for the reform of public schools. Most of the measures were not accepted, but the expansion of the Indiana College was approved, and township schools were granted considerably more power over their own operations.Gugin, p. 76 The Second Bank of the United States was closed during Noble's first term, leaving the state without a bank to hold government deposits or to supply paper money. There had been no banks operating in Indiana for a decade, so with no alternative to the situation the General Assembly passed a bill to create the Bank of Indiana. Noble had not taken a position on the bill, but signed it into law. The bank eventually turned out to be very profitable and one of the most important acts of his time in office. Noble also oversaw the creation of plans to build Indiana's third statehouse in 1831. The building was completed in 1835, and he also oversaw the move of the government's offices.Gugin, p. 77 =Second Term= Projects of the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act Noble was re-elected in 1834, campaigning against James G. Read for a second time. During the campaign, Noble sold a Kentucky slave that belonged to his father. The account was widely published, and turned the anti-slavery elements in the state against him, demonstrating by his receiving only 28 votes from the Quaker- dominated eastern counties of the state.Woollen, p. 67 He ultimately won the election, 27,767 to 19,994 votes. Noble called out the militia in parts of the state when it was threatened during the Black Hawk War, a Native American uprising to the west of Indiana. 150 men were sent to Illinois, where they skirmished with the native uprising.Woollen, p. 68 The scare was only brief, and the focus soon returned to the internal improvements. With the legislature closely divided on the issue, additional projects were proposed for the southern areas of the state to gain the support of their representatives. All the projects were bundled into one bill and passed as the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act in 1836. The act caused a great deal of celebration in the state and Noble considered the act his greatest achievement at the time. To pay for the act, which was projected to cost $10 million, Noble had also recommended a 50% increase in all state taxes. However, the legislature failed to pass that measure.Gugin, p. 74 The Panic of 1837 hit the following year, causing a sharp decrease in tax revenues, even as the state budget was already faced a large deficit because of the interest on the debt. Property taxes were the state's primary regular income, and to increase the revenue Noble proposed that the tax be levied ad valorem. The change would save the state a significant amount in administrative and collection costs, and make more land subject to taxation. The tax was approved and led to a 25% increase in revenue the following year, but it was still not enough to cover the deficit. Noble proposed the projects be prioritized, and work halted on the less important ones to conserve funds, but the plan was rejected. By the time Noble left office, the state's financial situation was bleak, but it was not yet fully apparent that far more had been borrowed than could be paid back. Despite the dire situation, Noble left office in 1837 as a popular political figure and was able to use his prestige to help elect David Wallace, his lieutenant governor, as governor. In both 1834 and 1836, Noble had his name entered as a candidate for the United States Senate, but in both years the legislature decided to send someone else to Congress, much to Noble's disappointment.Gugin, p. 78 Later life =State bankruptcy= After leaving office Noble became a member of the Board of Internal Improvements which was tasked with overseeing the ongoing internal improvements in the state. In 1840, the state ended all funding for the projects. By early 1841 it was clear that the state would not be able to pay even the interest on its debt, and paying it off was out of the question. The board approved the sending of James Lanier to negotiate a bankruptcy with the state's creditors, and all the internal improvement projects, except the separately funded Wabash and Erie Canal, were turned over to the creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. =Death and legacy= Even before Noble had left office, many of his opponents began to blame him for the state's financial situation. He argued that he had proposed tax increases to fund the project, and it was the fault of the General Assembly for not enacting them. Although the short term situation was devastating to the state and many of the projects were never completed, the groundwork laid by the projects led to rapid development after the financial situation was resolved. In the meantime, the debacle became apparent to the public during his successor's term and led to the gradual collapse of the state's Whig party, which never regained power in Indiana. In the immediate years thereafter the Democrats came to power and disposed of all the projects. The situation ultimately led to language in the 1851 constitution prohibiting the state from assuming debt. Noble returned to private life following the dissolution of the Internal Improvement Board in 1841. The situation was too dire, and opinion too anti-Whig for Noble to have a serious chance of winning public office again. He died at the age of 50 in Indianapolis two years later, on February 8, 1844, and was buried next to his wife, Catherin, in Greenlawn Cemetery. His body was moved to Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis in 1979.Woollen, p. 66 Noble County, Indiana is named in his honor, as is Noble Township in Cass County.

The meaning of her bowed head has been a matter of debate since the relief's excavation from the Acropolis of Athens in 1888. As the conventional name suggests, many have taken the posture to indicate sadness or pensiveness, and thus to interpret the rectangular object on the viewer's right as a stele, a stone slab that serves as a grave marker.

Together with the ballade and the virelai it was considered one of the three formes fixes, and one of the verse forms in France most commonly set to music between the late 13th and the 15th centuries. It is structured around a fixed pattern of repetition of material involving a refrain. The rondeau is believed to have originated in dance songs involving alternating singing of the refrain elements by a group and of the other lines by a soloist. The term \\"Rondeau\\" is today used both in a wider sense, covering several older variants of the form ‚Äì which are sometimes distinguished as the triolet and rondel ‚Äì and in a narrower sense referring to a 15-line variant which developed from these forms in the 15th and 16th centuries. The rondeau is unrelated with the much later instrumental dance form that shares the same name in French baroque music, which is an instance of what is more commonly called the rondo form in classical music. Verse structure  Structural plan of 14th century rondel/rondeau forms The older French rondeau or rondel as a song form between the 13th and mid-15th century begins with a full statement of its refrain, which consists of two halves. This is followed first by a section of non- refrain material that mirrors the metrical structure and rhyme of the refrain's first half, then by a repetition of the first half of the refrain, then by a new section corresponding to the structure of the full refrain, and finally by a full restatement of the refrain. Thus, it can be schematically represented as AB aAab AB, where \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" are the repeated refrain parts, and \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" the remaining verses. If the poem has more than one stanza, it continues with further sequences of aAab AB, aAab AB, etc. In its simplest and shortest form, the rondeau simple, each of the structural parts is a single verse, leading to the eight-line structure known today as triolet, as shown in \\"Doulz viaire gracieus\\" by Guillaume de Machaut: { Doulz viaire gracieus, de fin cuer vous ay servi. Weillies moy estre piteus, Doulz viaire gracieus, Se je sui un po honteus, ne me mettes en oubli: Doulz viaire gracieus, de fin cuer vous ay servi. A B a A a b A B Sweet gracious face, I have served you with a sincere heart. If you will have pity on me, sweet gracious face, then if I am a bit shy, do not embarrass me: Sweet gracious face, I have served you with a sincere heart. } In larger rondeau variants, each of the structural sections may consist of several verses, although the overall sequence of sections remains the same. Variants include the rondeau tercet, where the refrain consists of three verses, the rondeau quatrain, where it consists of four (and, accordingly, the whole form of sixteen), and the rondeau cinquain, with a refrain of five verses (and a total length of 21), which becomes the norm in the 15th century. In the rondeau quatrain, the rhyme scheme is usually ABBA ab AB abba ABBA; in the rondeau cinquain it is AABBA aab AAB aabba AABBA. A typical example of a rondeau cinquain of the 15th century is the following: :All√©s, Regrez, vuidez de ma presence; :all√©s ailleurs querir vostre acointance; :ass√©s av√©s tourment√© mon las cueur, :rempli de deuil pour estre serviteur :d'une sans per que j'ay aym√©e d'enfance. :Fait lui av√©s longuement ceste offence, :Ou est celluy qui onc fut ne en France, :qui endurast tel mortel deshonneur? ::All√©s, Regrez, ‚Ä¶ :N'y tourn√©s plus, car, par ma conscience, :se plus vous voy prochain de ma plaisance, :devant chascun vous feray tel honneur :que l'on dira que la main d'ung seigneur :vous a bien mis a la malle meschance. ::All√©s, Regrez, ‚Ä¶ Structural plan of the literary 13-line rondel and 15-line rondeau of the later Renaissance. In the medieval manuscripts, the restatement of the refrain is usually not written out, but only indicated by giving the first words or first line of the refrain part. After the mid-15th century, this feature came to be regarded no longer as a mere scribal abbreviation, but as an actual part of the poetry. As the form was gradually divorced from the musical structure and became a purely literary genre, it is often not entirely clear how much of the refrain material was actually meant to be repeated. A rondeau quatrain in which the first refrain interjection (lines 7‚Äì8, rhymes AB) is preserved in full, while the final restatement of the refrain is reduced to a single line (A) or again just two lines (AB), ends up with a total of 13 or 14 lines respectively. This form is usually defined as the \\"rondel\\" in modern literary compendia. Another version has the refrains shortened even further. Both restatements are reduced to just the first two or three words of the first line, which now stand as short, pithy, non-rhyming lines in the middle and at the end of the poem. These half- lines are called rentrement. If derived from the erstwhile rondeau quatrain, this results in a 12-line structure that is now called the \\"rondeau prime\\", with the rentrements in lines 7 and 12. If derived from the erstwhile 21-line rondeau cinquain, the result is a 15-line form with the rentrements in lines 9 and 15 (rhyme scheme aabba‚ÄìaabR‚ÄìaabbaR). This 15-line form became the norm in the literary rondeau of the later Renaissance, and is known as the \\"rondeau\\" proper today. The following is a typical example of this form: :Avant mes jours mort me fault encourir, :Par un regard dont m'as voulu ferir, :Et ne te chault de ma grefve tristesse; :Mais n'est ce pas √† toy grande rudesse, :Veu que to peulx si bien me secourir? :Aupr√©s de l'eau me fault de soif perir; :Je me voy jeune, et en aage fleurir, :Et si me monstre estre plein de vieillesse ::Avant mes jours. :Or, si je meurs, je veulx Dieu requerir :Prendre mon ame, et sans plus enquerir, :Je donne aux vers mon corps plein de foiblesse; :Quant est du cueur, du tout je te le laisse, :Ce nonobstant que me faces mourir ::Avant mes jours. A large corpus of medieval French rondeaux was collected, catalogued, and studied by Nico H.J. van den Boogaard in his dissertation Rondeaux et refrains du XIIe si√®cle au d√©but du XIVe: Collationnement, introduction et notes (Paris: Klincksieck, 1969).  Musical form  Machaut, \\"Doulz viaire gracieus\\", a typical Rondeau setting of the 14th-century Ars nova. Like the other formes fixes, the Rondeau (in its original form with full refrains) was frequently set to music. The earliest surviving polyphonic rondeaux are by the trouv√®re Adam de la Halle in the late 13th century. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Guillaume de Machaut, Guillaume Dufay, Hayne van Ghizeghem and other prominent composers were prolific in the form. Early rondeaux are usually found as interpolations in longer narrative poems, and separate monophonic musical settings survive. After the 15th century, the musical form went out of fashion and the rondeau became a purely literary form. The musical rondeau is typically a two-part composition, with all the \\"A\\" sections of the poem's AB-aAab-AB structure set to one line of music, and all the \\"B\\" parts to another. Although far rarer than the French usage, the Italian equivalent, the rondello was occasionally composed and listed among the Italian forms of poetry for music. A single rondello appears in the Rossi Codex. In addition, several rondeaux in French appear entirely in sources originating in Italy, the Low Countries, and Germany, suggesting that these works (including Esperance, qui en mon cuer) may not have a purely French provenance. Later, in the Baroque era, the label rondeau (or the adjectival phrase en rendeau) was applied to dance movements in simple refrain form by such composers as Jean-Baptiste Lully and Louis Couperin. Arnold Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire sets 21 poems by Albert Giraud, each of which is a 13-line poetic rondeau.  English rondeau  The French rondeau forms have been adapted to English at various times by different poets. Geoffrey Chaucer wrote two rondeaus in the rondeau tercet form, one of them at the end of The Parliament of Fowls, where the birds are said to \\"synge a roundel\\" to a melody \\"imaked in Fraunce\\": :Now welcome, somer, with thy sonne softe, :That hast thes wintres wedres overshake, :And driven away the longe nyghtes blake! ::Saynt Valentyn, that art ful hy on-lofte, ::Thus syngen smale foules for they sake: :Now welcome, somer, with thy sonne softe, :That hast thes wintres wedres overshake, ::Wel han they cause for to gladen ofte, ::Sith ech of hem recovered hath hys make, ::Ful blissful mowe they synge when they wake: :Now welcome, somer, with thy sonne softe, :That hast thes wintres wedres overshake, :And driven away the longe nyghtes blake! In its classical 16th- century 15-line form with a rentrement (aabba‚ÄìaabR‚ÄìaabbaR), the rondeau was used by Thomas Wyatt. Later, it was reintroduced by some late 19th-century and 20th-century poets, such as Paul Laurence Dunbar (\\"We Wear the Mask\\"). It was customarily regarded as a challenge to arrange for these refrains to contribute to the meaning of the poem in as succinct and poignant a manner as possible. Perhaps the best-known English rondeau is the World War I poem, In Flanders Fields by John McCrae: :In Flanders fields the poppies blow :Between the crosses, row on row, :That mark our place; and in the sky, :The larks, still bravely singing, fly, :Scarce heard amid the guns below. :We are the dead; short days ago :We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, :Loved and were loved, and now we lie ::In Flanders fields. :Take up our quarrel with the foe! :To you from failing hands we throw :The torch; be yours to hold it high! :If ye break faith with us who die :We shall not sleep, though poppies grow ::In Flanders fields.  Rondeau redoubl√©  A more complex form is the rondeau redoubl√©. This is also written on two rhymes, but in five stanzas of four lines each and one of five lines. Each of the first four lines (stanza 1) get individually repeated in turn once by becoming successively the respective fourth lines of stanzas 2, 3, 4, & 5; and the first part of the first line is repeated as a short fifth line to conclude the sixth stanza. This can be represented as - A1,B1,A2,B2 - b,a,b,A1 - a,b,a,B1 - b,a,b,A2 - a,b,a,B2 - b,a,b,a,(A1). The following example of the form was written from the point of view of one of the RAF officers carrying the coffin of Diana, Princess of Wales to the plane that was to carry it to England. :Guard of Honour :by Paul Hansford :The burden I bear is more heavy than lead. :The physical weight is a thing that I share, :but the loss that I feel will not leave my head. :Why did you have to die?

He is presumed to have been kidnapped. , there have been no arrests made and the case is now considered cold, but remains open. His mother, Noreen Gosch, claimed that Johnny escaped from his captors and visited her with an unidentified man in March 1997. She claimed that her son told her that he had been the victim of a pedophile organization and had been cast aside when he was too old but subsequently feared for his life and lived under an assumed identity, feeling it was not safe to return home. Gosch's father, John, divorced from Noreen since 1993, has publicly stated that he is not sure whether or not such a visit actually occurred. Authorities have not located Gosch or confirmed Noreen Gosch's account, and his fate continues to be the subject of speculation, conspiracy theories, and dispute. The case received huge publicity in 2006 when his mother claimed to have found photographs on her doorstep depicting Gosch in captivity. Some of the photos received were claimed to be children from a case in Florida, but one boy in the photos was never identified. Noreen Gosch insists that boy is Johnny.The Johnny Gosch Foundation at www.johnnygosch.com Gosch's picture was among the first to be featured on milk cartons as part of a campaign to find missing children. Disappearance On Sunday, September 5, 1982, in the suburb of West Des Moines, Johnny Gosch left home before dawn to begin his paper route. Although it was customary for Johnny to awaken his father to help with the route, the boy took only the family's miniature dachshund, Gretchen, with him that morning. Other paper carriers for The Des Moines Register would later report having seen Gosch at the paper drop, picking up his newspapers. It was the last sighting of Gosch that can be corroborated by multiple witnesses. A neighbor named Mike reported that he observed Gosch talking to a stocky man in a blue two-toned Ford Fairmont with Nebraska plates;\\"Who Took Johnny,\\" RumuR, Inc. (2014). Documentary film. Mike did not know what was discussed because he was observing from his bedroom window. As Gosch headed home, Mike noticed another man following Gosch. Another witness, John Rossi, saw a man in a blue car talking to Gosch and \\"thought something was strange\\". He looked at the license plate, but could not recall the plate number. He said, \\"I keep hoping I'll wake up in the middle of the night and see that number on the license plate as distinctly as night and day, but that hasn't happened.\\" Rossi underwent hypnosis and told police some of the numbers and that the plate was from Warren County, Iowa. John and Noreen Gosch, Johnny's parents, began receiving phone calls from customers along their son's route, complaining of undelivered papers. John performed a cursory search of the neighborhood around 6 a.m. He immediately found Johnny's wagon full of newspapers two blocks from their home. The Gosches immediately contacted the West Des Moines police department, and reported Johnny's disappearance. Noreen, in her public statements and her book Why Johnny Can't Come Home, has been critical of what she perceives as a slow reaction time from authorities, and of the policy at the time that Gosch could not be classified as a missing person until 72 hours had passed. By her estimation, the police did not arrive to take her report for a full 45 minutes. Initially, the police came to believe that Gosch was a runaway, but later they changed their statement and suggested that Gosch was kidnapped, but they were unable to establish a viable motive. They turned up little evidence and arrested no suspects in connection with the case. A few months after his September 1982 disappearance, Noreen Gosch has said her son was spotted in Oklahoma, when a boy yelled to a woman for help before being dragged off by two men. Over the years, several private investigators have assisted the Gosches with the search for their son. Among them are Jim Rothstein, a retired New York City police detective and Ted Gunderson, a retired chief of the Los Angeles FBI branch. In 1984, Gosch's photograph appeared alongside that of Juanita Rafaela Estevez on milk cartons across America; they were the second and third abducted children to have their plights publicized in this way. The first was Etan Patz. = Another missing paperboy = On August 12, 1984, Eugene Martin, another Des Moines-area paperboy, disappeared under similar circumstances. He disappeared while delivering newspapers on the south side of Des Moines. Authorities were unable to prove a connection between the two cases, yet Noreen Gosch claims that she was personally informed of the abduction a few months in advance by a private investigator who was searching for her son. She was told the kidnapping \\"would take place the second weekend in August 1984 and it would be a paperboy from the southside of Des Moines.\\" Noreen Gosch's claims According to Noreen Gosch's account, she was awakened around 2:30 a.m. one morning in March 1997 by a knock at her apartment door. Waiting outside was Johnny Gosch, now 27, accompanied by an unidentified man. Gosch said she immediately recognized her son, who opened his shirt to reveal a birthmark on his chest. \\"We talked about an hour or an hour and a half. He was with another man, but I have no idea who the person was. Johnny would look over to the other person for approval to speak,\\" says Gosch. \\"He didn't say where he is living or where he was going.\\" In a 2005 interview, Gosch said, \\"The night that he came here, he was wearing jeans and a shirt and had a coat on because it was March. It was cold and his hair was long; it was shoulder-length and it was straight and dyed black.\\" After the visit, she had the FBI create a picture she says looked like Johnny. Gosch self-published a book in 2000 titled Why Johnny Can't Come Home. The book presents her understanding of what her son went through, based on the original research of various private investigators and her son's visit. On September 1, 2006, Gosch reported that she found photographs left at her front door, some of which she posted on her website. One color photo shows three boys bound and gagged. She claims that a black-and-white photo appears to show 12-year-old Johnny Gosch with his mouth gagged, his hands and feet tied, and an apparent human brand on his shoulder. A third photo shows a man, possibly dead, who may have something tied around his neck. Mrs. Gosch alleged the man was one of the \\"perpetrators who molested [my] son\\". Gosch later said the first two photos had originated on a website featuring child pornography. On September 13, an anonymous letter was mailed to Des Moines police. > Gentlemen, > Someone has played a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in > question is not one of her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about > 1979‚Äì80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an > investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) > Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. > The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be > easy enough to check out. Nelson Zalva, who worked for the Hillsborough County, Florida Sheriff's Office in the 1970s, said the details of the letter were true and adds that he also investigated the black-and-white in \\"1978 or 1979\\", before Gosch's disappearance. \\"I interviewed the kids, and they said there was no coercion or touching. ... I could never prove a crime,\\" Zalva says. When asked for proof that this was indeed the same photo from the investigation nearly three decades prior, Zalva could not provide any. According to the documentary film Who Took Johnny (2014), only three boys in the pictures were identified by law enforcement, but not the one thought to be Johnny. Noreen Gosch still believes the pictures to be of her son. National interest The case generated national interest as Noreen Gosch became increasingly vocal about the inadequacy of law enforcement's investigation of missing children cases. She established the Johnny Gosch Foundation in 1982, through which she visited schools and spoke at seminars about the modus operandi of sexual predators. She lobbied for \\"The Johnny Gosch Bill\\", state legislation which would mandate an immediate police response to reports of missing children. The bill became law in Iowa in 1984, and similar or identical laws were later passed in Missouri and seven other states. In August 1984, Noreen Gosch testified in Senate hearings on organized crime, speaking about \\"organized pedophilia\\" and its alleged role in her son's abduction. She began receiving death threats. Gosch also testified before the U.S. Department of Justice, which provided $10 million to establish the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Gosch was invited to the White House by President Ronald Reagan for the dedication ceremony. = Bonacci allegations = In 1989, 21-year-old Paul A. Bonacci told his attorney John DeCamp that he had been abducted into a sex ring with Gosch as a teenager and was forced to participate in Gosch's kidnapping. John DeCamp met with Bonacci and believed he was telling the truth. Noreen later met him and said he told her things \\"he could know only from talking with her son.\\" He said that Johnny had a birthmark on his chest, a scar on his tongue and a burn scar on his lower leg; although a description of the birthmark had been widely circulated, information about the scars had not been made public. Bonacci also described a stammer that Johnny had when he was upset. The FBI and local police do not believe that Bonacci is a credible witness in the case and have not interviewed him. Bonacci accused Republican party activist and businessman Lawrence E. King Jr (b. 1944) who also served as director of the Franklin Credit Union in Omaha, Nebraska, of running an underage prostitution ring and victimizing him since an early age. In 1990, a county grand jury declined to charge King, finding the allegations to be \\"a carefully crafted hoax\\". Paul Bonacci and Alisha Owen were indicted on state perjury charges. A federal grand jury also declined to indict anyone for child prostitution but did return indictments against Owen for perjury and King for fraud related to the credit union; the latter was accused of looting $40 million from the bank and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The bank was shut down in November 1988 when it was raided by the FBI, the IRS and the NCUA. King was released from prison in April 2001. On February 27, 1999, the U.S. District Court of the District of Nebraska awarded Bonacci $1 million in compensatory damages and punitive damages. Bonacci had sued King, who failed to respond to the civil lawsuit. Thus a default judgment was entered against King, who ceased his appeal attempt in early 2000.Newton, Michael (2009).

Margot's deportation order from the Gestapo hastened the Frank family into hiding. According to the diary of her younger sister, Anne, Margot kept a diary of her own, but no trace of Margot's diary has ever been found. She died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Jeker School in Amsterdam - The Elementary School of Margot Frank. Early life and education Margot Betti Frank, named after her maternal aunt Bettina Holl√§nder (1898‚Äì1914), was born in Frankfurt, Germany, to Jewish parents, Otto and Edith, and lived in the outer suburbs of the city with her parents, Otto Frank and Edith Frank- Holl√§nder, and also her younger sister Anne Frank, during the early years of her life. Edith and Otto were devoted parents, who were interested in scholarly pursuits and had an extensive library; both parents encouraged the children to read. At the time her sister Anne was born, the family lived in a house at Marbachweg 307 in Frankfurt-Dornbusch, where they rented two floors. Margot and Anne played almost every day in the garden with the children in the neighborhood. They all had different backgrounds; Catholic, Protestant or Jewish. They shared a curiosity about each other's religious holidays. Margot was invited to the communion celebration of one of her friends, and the neighbors' children were sometimes invited to the Frank's celebration of Hanukkah. In 1931 the family moved to Ganghoferstrasse 24 in a fashionable liberal area of Dornbusch called the Dichterviertel (Poets' Quarter). Both houses still exist. In the summer of 1932, the Nazis' paramilitary wing ‚Äì Sturmabteilung (SA) ‚Äì marched through the streets of Frankfurt am Main wearing swastika armbands. These Brownshirts, as they were called because of the color of their uniforms, loudly sang: ‚ÄúWhen Jewish blood spurts from the knife, things will go well again‚Äù. Upon hearing this, Anne's parents Edith and Otto discussed their concerns with each other. It was impossible for them to leave their homeland immediately because making a living abroad was of course an issue. Margot attended the Ludwig-Richter School in Frankfurt until the appointment of Adolf Hitler on January 30, 1933, to the position of chancellor in Germany brought an increase of anti-Jewish measures, among which was the expulsion of Jewish schoolchildren from non-denominational schools. In response to the rising tide of anti-semitism, the family decided to follow the 63,000 other Jews who had left Germany that year and immigrate to Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Edith Frank and her daughters moved in with her mother in Aachen in June 1933 until Otto Frank found accommodation in Amsterdam. Margot and her mother left Germany to join him on December 5, 1933, followed by Anne in February 1934. Margot was enrolled in an elementary school on Amsterdam's Jekerstraat, close to their new address. Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, Margot went on to become a star pupil. She achieved excellent academic results until an anti-Jewish law imposed a year after the 1940 German invasion of the Netherlands demanded her removal to a Jewish lyceum. There she displayed the studiousness and intelligence which had made her noteworthy at her previous schools and was remembered by former pupils as virtuous, reserved, and very obedient. Margot had a large circle of friends and enjoyed rowing and playing tennis in her spare time. In her diary, Anne recounted instances of their mother suggesting she emulate Margot, and although she wrote of admiring her sister in some respects for being handsome and clever, Anne sought to define her own individuality without role models. Margot is also shown to have a much better relationship with at their mother, and had a much more modest and tolerant nature as opposed to Anne, who was determined and often spoke her mind. Although her sister Anne also took Hebrew classes at a later point, Anne was, like her father, not as much interested in the Jewish tradition as Margot. Margot followed the example of her mother, who became involved in Amsterdam's Liberal Jewish community. She took Hebrew classes, attended synagogue, and in 1941 joined a Dutch Zionist club for young people who wanted to immigrate to Palestine to found a Jewish state, where, as Anne Frank described in her diary, she wished to become a midwife. On July 5, 1942, she received a notice to report to a labor camp and the next day went into hiding with her family in a secret annex of a house. They were later joined by four other Jewish refugees and remained hidden for two years until they were betrayed on August 4, 1944. Stolperstein for Margot Frank at the Pastorplatz in Aachen, Germany Arrest and death Along with the other occupants of the hiding place, Margot Frank was arrested by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, and detained in their headquarters overnight before being taken to a cell in a nearby prison for three days. From here they were taken by train, on 8 August, to the Dutch Westerbork concentration camp. As the Frank family had failed to respond to Margot's call-up notice in 1942 and had been discovered in hiding, they (along with Fritz Pfeffer and the Van Pels family) were declared criminals by the camp's officials and detained in its punishment block to be sentenced to hard labor in the battery dismantling plant. They remained there until they were selected for Westerbork's last deportation to Auschwitz on September 3, 1944. Margot and Anne were transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on October 30, where both contracted typhus in the winter of 1944. Margot Frank died in February or March 1945 at the age of 18 or 19 due to typhus. A few days later, Anne died due to the same illness. Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper and her sister Lientje buried them together in one of the camp's mass graves; in August 1945, once she came back to the Netherlands and recovered from typhus, Janny wrote to Otto Frank and informed him that both of his daughters had died. Otto Frank was the only one to survive out of the eight people who went into hiding. When he returned to Amsterdam he was given Anne's diary by Miep Gies, which he later published as a remembrance to her. Along with Anne, Margot Frank also wrote a diary during their time in hiding (Anne mentioned her sister's diary in her own) but Margot's diary was never found. However, many authors wrote fan-based diaries of Margot such as the novel The Silent Sister by Mazal Alouf-Mizrahi. Letters written by both Frank sisters to American pen pals were published in 2003. Buddy Elias (1925‚Äì2015) was Anne's first cousin and last surviving close relative. References  Further reading  * Anne Frank.

It is an anonymous work. In the play there are two scoundrels, a \\"blind\\" beggar and his servant boy. The blind beggar has a secret hoard of coins, which the boy tricks away from him. The boy deceives, robs then beats his master‚Äîthe trickster has become the tricked. It was a simple play with no props and could be performed by two actors anywhere. It probably is one of many performed by wandering jongleurs catering to the tastes and theme of market days and fairs. An important business for the actors was to collect money from spectators, and the actors beggar-man part in the play allowed for comic audience participation. Because the deceiver is deceived, along with slapstick action, it is considered the oldest surviving farce in French literature. This means it is the oldest to survive in written form, but is part of a much older oral tradition. This \\"trickster is tricked\\" theme, and that of the cuckolded husband, were the main preoccupations of the medieval farceur. The play is in many respects identical to the first chapter of \\"The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes,\\" a picaresque novel published anonymously in Spain in 1554. The play may have served as source material for the book, or both may have emerged from a common folktale. References *Le Garcon et l'Aveugle. Trans. Richard Axton and John E. Stevens.

The Borsec Depression has an oval shape and is northeast oriented, being separated from the hilltop of the Rotunda Chair in two subunits. The locality is composed of two areas that correspond geographically to the two small depression areas that join: The Upper Borsec (Borsec de Sus) and The Lower Borsec (Borsec de Jos). The latter is southwest along DN15 at its junction with DJ128 Borsec- Ditrau, and Borsec de Sus (or the resort itself) is located on the plateau located northeast of the primary settlement, which is at higher altitude on average with 80-100 m. In the west, at a short distance, you can reach the Topli≈£a, the Pass of Creanga and to the east the Bistricioara valley. The Borsec depression is located as altitude superior to that of Giurgeu but lower than that of Bilbor. Within the resort there are alleys and tourist trails, most of which are located in the outskirts of the resort, especially for visiting the nature monuments from the reservation of the Scaunul Rotund and FƒÉget (B√ºkkhavas). They have the necessary arrangements to perform the field treatment under appropriate conditions, including tourist markings. Mineral water springs - the main resource of Borsec Viaduct support of mineral water supply for the bottling plant Mineral water springs are numerous, with a close and stable chemical composition over time, with variable but sufficient flows to be economically used and are currently the main economic engine of the resort. The mineralization characters fall into the group of bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, carbonate and hypotonic mixed mineral waters. The springs of the Borsec Depression occur in two groups - the northern one of greater importance - the springs line having originating from dolomitic crystalline limestone, sources characterized by the accumulation of water in the cracks and the karstic voids (springs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6); and the southern group - the line of springs cantonated in calcareous tuff with a restricted circulation of water through cracks and areas of alteration (springs 10, 11, 15). The most important springs qualitative and as flow of the resort are the springs 1 and 2. Both are captured, their carbonated water - bicarbonated being used for bottling, external and internal cures. Indications of treatment (hydromineral, peloid, balneoclimatic) It is not advisable to use mineral water in the form of a cleanse without medical indication. In the internal cure (through the direct consumption of mineral water), the springs in Borsec are indicated: ‚Ä¢ In diseases of the digestive tract and the adjacent glands: chronic hypo- or normoacid gastritis, dyspepsia, mild enteritis, enterocolitis, fermentation colitis. ‚Ä¢ In chronic hepatitis, posthepatitis states, biliary disorders, sequelae after on the bile ducts surgery. ‚Ä¢ In nutrition diseases: compensated and balanced diabetes mellitus type 2, gout and uterine diathesis. ‚Ä¢ Endocrine diseases: mild hyperthyroid. ‚Ä¢ In diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract: chronic nephritis without kidney failure, pyelonephritis, chronic cystitis, acid urinary lithiasis, sequelae after operations on the urinary tract. In external treatment (through bathing) the Borsec mineral waters can be used in: ‚Ä¢ cardiovascular diseases: chronic myocarditis - no cardiac failure phenomena; valvulopathies - compensated; coronary insufficiency - with mild access, essential hypertension - in the early stages, obliterating arteriopathies - in early stages, sequelae after thrombophlebitis. In the Upper Borsec in the wet areas formed on a clayey layer located on the right side of the Usturoi brook there is a peat (in some parts the thickness exceeds 10 m). The chemical composition gives it qualities of therapeutic sludge that makes it possible to use it in rheumatic diseases. Unfortunately, nowadays the Medical Recovery activity is stopped as a result of the closure of the Treatment Base. Name Its name is derived from Hungarian \\"borvizsz√©k\\" meaning \\"Seat of Mineral Water\\". Tourism Borsec owes its fame to its mineral waters, known for their curing properties. Natural cures (the healing properties of the microclimate, surrounding air, soil and water) and physiotherapeutic properties are reputedly able to improve nutrition and heal a host of metabolic disorders. Borsec is a favorable place for rest and recreation: it is a real paradise for those who enjoy excursions (known destinations include Poiana Z√¢nelor, the ice cave, the bears' cave, Izvorul Str«évechi, Cetatea Bufni»õelor), those who like winter sports (on FƒÉget and Fagetel for beginners and those more advanced) as well as those who like to fish, who can try their luck in the waters of Bistricioara or the Bicaz lake, which are near the resort. One famous visitor to Borsec was Moldavian writer Vasile Alecsandri, who wrote the following in 1845: \\"at Borsec they all are brothers, if not in Jesus then in mineral water [...] one of the most important merits of Borsec is that it gives people human feelings!\\" Nearby locations include the monasteries of Moldavia (Neam≈£, Secu, VƒÉratec, Agapia, DurƒÉu, SihƒÉstria), the L√°z√°r Castle, Lacul Ro≈üu, Cheile Bicazului, Lake Bicaz, the DurƒÉu resort, the Praid salt mine, Sovata, and the ceramics centre of Corund. Borsec ski slope in spring.

The idea behind Tazos started out similar to Pogs, whereby each Tazo contained a score value, and a game was played to 'win' Tazos from other players. Tazos have been released in several different formats, ranging from the original circular disks, to octagonal disks, and in later years, to resemble more of a collectible card. In addition to the Japanese Pog Battle game, some Tazo series feature small incisions around the outside, allowing players to fit them together and build objects. The Star Wars series also included additional pieces which allowed players to construct spaceships. Tazos are commonly made from a plastic base, but some series have been produced from cardboard or aluminium (such as the Australian Yu-Gi-Oh! Metallix series).  Tazos series Tazos started out with a set of 100 disks featuring the images of Looney Tunes characters and 124 Tiny Toons tazos in 1994. The disks were added to the products of Mexican snacks company Sabritas and were named after the expression taconazo (to kick with the heel) which was a reference to another popular school game in Mexico where children open bottles with their shoes trying to launch the caps the furthest.

The band had three UK top twenty hits in the late 1960s, including \\"From the Underworld\\" and \\"I Don't Want Our Loving to Die\\", before Frampton left in 1968 to form Humble Pie with Steve Marriott. The band broke up shortly after, reforming briefly and unsuccessfully in 1971. Biography The Herd were founded in 1965 in south London, and recorded three unsuccessful singles with Parlophone. In 1966 three members in succession (Terry Clark, Louis Cennamo and Mick Underwood) quit the group and the group got the line-up that made it famous. The singer, Peter Frampton, was 16 when he joined the group in 1966 and had just left school. The other members were a few years older. Parlophone did not want to go on with them, but Fontana was willing to give them a try. They also sent their manager Billy Gaff away and brought in the songwriters/producers Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley instead. This pair had been largely responsible for a string of hits by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich. Howard and Blaikley orchestrated for them a unique blend of pop and flower power. After a UK Singles Chart near-miss with \\"I Can Fly\\" (April 1967), the haunting \\"From the Underworld\\", (August 1967) based on the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, reached Number 6 later that year with help from copious plays on pirate radio. It was a hit in other countries too. In the Netherlands the song reached Number 3.Survey of 1967 hits in the Netherlands (archived) \\"From the Underworld\\" was followed by \\"Paradise Lost\\", (November 1967) which made it up to Number 15. In October 1967 they supported the Jimi Hendrix Experience at The Saville Theatre, London. Their greatest success came with \\"I Don't Want Our Loving to Die\\", (March 1968) a Number 5 UK hit single. With his boyish photogenic looks, Frampton was dubbed \\"The Face of ‚Äô68\\" by teen magazine Rave. The last months of 1968 were tempestuous times for the group. Steele left the group, to be replaced by Henry Spinetti. The group dumped their managers Howard and Blaikley, and briefly found a new mentor in Harvey Lisberg who after three months found himself so bogged down with their personnel problems that he politely withdrew his services. Most songs on their first and only album Paradise Lost were written by Peter Frampton and Andy Bown, just like their next single, \\"Sunshine Cottage\\". Dissatisfied with mere teen idol status, and disappointed with the failure of \\"Sunshine Cottage\\", Frampton left by the end of 1968 to form Humble Pie with Steve Marriott. The remaining members Bown, Spinetti and Taylor made another flop single, \\"The Game\\", then minus Taylor, formed the short-lived Judas Jump with Allan Jones, saxophonist from Amen Corner, and Welsh vocalist Adrian Williams. Taylor, who became a disc jockey, and Steele, reunited briefly for a one-off single \\"You've Got Me Hangin' From Your Lovin' Tree\\" in June 1971, to almost universal lack of interest. By the late 1970s Bown had become a member of UK rockers Status Quo and both Taylor and Spinetti joined up with Gerry Rafferty.

Accident WaRa 1 freight car (date unknown). A freight car like this one was involved in the Tsurumi rail accident. The 43rd wagon (type WaRa 1) of a long freight train hauled by a JNR Class EF15 electric locomotive on the down freight line derailed and the two following wagons overturned, blocking the adjacent up passenger line. Within seconds, a 12-carriage electric multiple unit (EMU) train traveling to Tokyo collided with the freight wagons and the front three carriages (KuHa 76039, MoHa 70079 and KuMoHa 50006 respectively) derailed, falling into the side of the fourth and fifth carriages of another 12-carriage train to Kurihama passing on the down passenger line. The multiple collision left 161 dead and 120 injured. Investigation The initial JNR investigation found that the speed of the freight train (60 km/h) was not excessive, nor were any problems found with the line or rolling stock. For five years from 1967 until 1972, the RTRI carried out tests on a test track located at Karikachi Pass in Hokkaido on an abandoned section of the Nemuro Main Line (Shintoku - Niinai) using the same rails and rolling stock and found that the combination of wheelset design, rail cross section and wear, and track geometry all had a role in the derailment. As a result of the investigation, the old method of static track inspection was replaced with new track inspection cars employing dynamic inspection methods and data collection.http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr33/pdf/f04_sai.pdf Japanese Railway Safety and the Technology of the Day Similar accidents * Beresfield train collision * Clapham Junction rail crash * Southall rail crash See also * Lists of rail accidents References Derailments in Japan T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line Transport in Yokohama Railway accidents in 1963 1963 in Japan Rail transport in Kanagawa Prefecture Accidents and incidents involving Japanese National Railways November 1963 events ","title":"Tsurumi rail accident"},{"id":"1797569","text":"Lochee High Street Lochee () is an area in the west of Dundee, Scotland. Until the 19th century, it was a separate town, but was eventually surrounded by the expanding Dundee. It is notable for being home to Camperdown Works, which was the largest jute production site in the world. History Cox's stack 'Lochee' originally referred to the area in which weavers' cottages were situated at the burn which flowed through Balgay Lochee; thus, they were at the eye of the loch or Loch E'e, which eventually became Lochee. It is believed this site is close to where Myrekirk stands today. Indeed, John Ainslie's map of 1794 makes reference to 'Locheye' on the north and south banks of the burn. However, G. Taylor and A. Skinner's 'Survey and maps of the roads of North Britain or Scotland' in 1776 makes reference to 'Lochee'. When the loch was drained by the Duncans in the 15th century they offered crofting tenancies along the burn. One of the tenancies went to a Dutchman, James Cox and his family. After a change of name and with a reputation for quality linen, the Cox family eventually set up as linen merchants in 1700. By 1760 the firm had 300 weavers and after using steam power and moving into the jute industry the family built Camperdown Works in 1864, said to be the largest factory in the world, with over 5,000 employees. Cox‚Äôs Stack, the 86 m (282 ft) high campanile-style factory chimney designed by local architect James MacLaren, survives. Lochee became a company town with 2 railway stations, police force, fire service, schools, swimming pool, casino, library, washhouse and several churches. In 1890 Cox Brothers donated a 25 acre public park to Lochee. Lochee is well known for being the home of Dundee's biggest ever gang, 'The Lochee Fleet' who were notorious in Dundee's gang culture throughout the 70's and 90's. Immigration Many immigrants were attracted to the area by the prospect of employment in the city's jute mills. By 1855, there were 14,000 Irish immigrants in Dundee, most of whom stayed in Lochee, or 'Little Tipperary' as it would come to be known. In 1904, the Lochee Harp football club was formed by Lochee Irishmen as a means of recreation for the poor immigrants; the club still plays to this day. Lochee is still regarded as Dundee's Irish 'quarter'.

It has historically been one of Transylvania and Romania's most important centers for copper mining, but its mines are no longer operational. Its Romanian name means \\"blond\\", the German name means \\"copper mine\\" while the Hungarian name means \\"Bal√°n mine.\\" Geography It lies in the Ciuc Depression (Romanian Depresiunea Ciucului, ). It is surrounded by the HƒÉ»ôma»ô Mountains (HƒÉ»ôma»ôul Mare and HƒÉ»ôma»ôul Mic). The town's altitude is 850 m; this rises to 1792 m at the highest peak of the HƒÉ»ôma»ô Mountains. BƒÉlan is crossed by the Olt River. Climate The temperate continental climate has an average temperature of 7ÀöC, falling to -10ÀöC in winter. There are 1300-1400 sunny hours per year. Wind gusts are rare due to the surrounding mountains and forests. Flora and fauna Most of the forests around BƒÉlan are spruce forests, but there are also fir, larch and maple forests. There are some flowers species in the area like edelweiss and sweet pea which are protected by law. In the forests there are some edible mushrooms species and fruits like blueberries, raspberries and cranberries. Demographics According to the census from 2011 it had a population of 5,864 of which 3,625 (61.82%) were Romanians, and 2,124 (36.22%) were Hungarians.Romanian Census 2011 History BƒÉlan was the site of iron mining during the 17th century, but by 1702 the iron stores had been depleted. The copper deposits were discovered in 1785 by J√°nos Opra; production began in 1803, and by 1853 six mines were in operation. From that period, the village gradually began to develop into a town. Until 1967, BƒÉlan remained part of the commune of S√¢ndominic, finally gaining official town status in 1968. In 2006 all mining-related activities were stopped by the Romanian government and nowadays the city is counting on ecotourism and small businesses as main economical activities. Points of interest BƒÉlan's main architectural site is the Roman Catholic Church, consecrated in 1869. Despite the environmental blight of the mining, the surrounding area is uncommonly beautiful, taking in the nearby mountains of HƒÉ»ôma»ôul Mare and TarcƒÉu, the former a popular hiking destination. The river Olt, one of Romania's most significant, originates in the mountains near the town.

Footballer Bradford was born on 8 June 1941 to a Belfast family resident in Limavady, County Londonderry, due to the wartime evacuation. Bradford's father left the family not long after his birth and his mother died so he was raised by foster parents. A talented footballer, Bradford signed for Glenavon F.C. as a teenager and his displays soon attracted the attentions of the English side Sheffield Wednesday F.C., who invited him to a trial. However, Bradford was not signed by the club and returned to Northern Ireland to resume his career with the then Belfast-based club Distillery. Religion Bradford gave up football in 1964, after deciding to train to become a Methodist minister. After spending the rest of the 1960s attached to congregations in East Belfast and Fivemiletown, Bradford was fully ordained in 1970 and given his own parish in the Suffolk area of southwest Belfast. Bradford later resigned from the Methodist ministry in the late 1970s after feeling that he and his fellow ministers were on divergent paths both politically and ecumenically. (Norah Bradford, A Sword Bathed in Heaven 1984:98) and would spend the final years of his life without a church. During these years he came to spend time in the 'Bible belt' of the US and became associated with American Evangelicalism. Nevertheless, Bradford claimed to always remain at heart a Methodist and also rejected suggestions that he was to join Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church (which he never did). Political career Bradford first became involved with unionism in 1971 when he joined the Orange Order. From here he became more involved in the political side of the movement and stood as a candidate for the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party in the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election in South Antrim, although he was not elected. Bradford was first elected as Member of Parliament for South Belfast in the February 1974 British general election, this time under the banner of the United Ulster Unionist Council (an alliance between the Vanguard, the Democratic Unionist Party and the anti-Brian Faulkner section of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) under Harry West), defeating the sitting MP Rafton Pounder, a pro-Faulkner Ulster Unionist. His campaign had been openly supported by the far-right National Front, and at a National Front rally September 1974, Martin Webster read out a letter of solidarity from Bradford.Nigel Fielding, The National Front, p. 182, Taylor & Francis, 1981; Bradford greatly increased his majority in the October election, after Pounder dropped out, and largely maintained this increased majority in 1979. Between 1974 and 1978 he sat for the Vanguard Party until in February 1978 he joined the UUP (then often called the Official Unionist Party), along with Vanguard leader William Craig and most of the membership. He was re-elected in 1979 for the UUP. He was described as a religious and political hardliner, identifying with British Israelism. In one of his speeches he said the causes of the problems in Northern Ireland were down to the Roman Catholic Church, Marxism, and ecumenical confusion.Lost Lives David McKittrick et al pg.887 Death A mural dedicated to Bradford, Oak Street off Belfast's Donegall Pass Bradford was shot dead by the IRA on 14 November 1981 in a community centre in Finaghy, Belfast, while hosting a political surgery. Kenneth Campbell, the 29-year-old Protestant caretaker in the centre, was also killed in the attack. Secretary of State Jim Prior was verbally abused and jostled by a group of angry loyalists outside the church at his funeral and hissed at by members of the congregation. Ian Paisley also protested against his attendance.Lost Lives David McKittrick et al pg.886 Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald made an expression of sympathy in D√°il √âireann (the lower house of parliament of the Ireland) stating:D√°il √âireann Parliamentary Debates - Volume 330 - 17 November 1981 The IRA described him as \\"one of the key people responsible for winding up the loyalist paramilitary sectarian machine\\", a \\"propogator of anti-Catholic sectarian hatred\\", and \\"a prominent motivator of attacks on Catholics\\". A number of Catholics were killed by loyalists in retaliation. His seat was won by Martin Smyth, also of the UUP, in a by-election in 1982. A book about Bradford's life, A sword bathed in heaven: The life, faith, and cruel death of the Rev. Robert Bradford B. Th. M.P. (1984), was written by his widow, Norah.

The Baltimore SO's modern history dates from 1965, when Baltimore arts patron Joseph Meyerhoff became president of the Orchestra, a position he held for 18 years. Meyerhoff appointed Romanian-born conductor Sergiu Comissiona as music director. Other music directors have included Yuri Temirkanov, music director from 20002006, who subsequently took the title of music director emeritus.

The 2005 announcement of her appointment caused controversy, over reports that the orchestra players statements that they had not had enough voice in the search process. The orchestra and Alsop met after the announcement and smoothed over some of their differences. Alsop's contract was subsequently extended in 2009 and in 2013. In February 2020, the Baltimore SO announced that Alsop is to conclude her music directorship of the orchestra at the close of the 2020‚Äì2021 season, and to take the title of Music Director Laureate. In February 2017, Peter T. Kjome became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the orchestra. The Baltimore SO's Principal Pops Conductor is Jack Everly. The orchestra's current BSO-Peabody conducting fellow is Michael Repper. In 2016, the BSO appointed Tonya McBride Robles as vice president and general manager. Concert halls/performance venues = Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall = The Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall has been the home of the Baltimore SO since its opening on September 16, 1982. Named for businessman and philanthropist Joseph Meyerhoff, the 2,443-seat hall has undergone renovations in 1990 and again in 2001.Leo Beranek, \\"Concert Halls and Opera Houses\\" 2nd ed. NY:Springer, 2007 p.33-46. = The Music Center at Strathmore = The Orchestra's second home is the 1,976-seat Music Center at Strathmore, located in North Bethesda, Maryland. With the opening of the Music Center at Strathmore in February 2005, the Baltimore Symphony became the nation's first orchestra with year-round venues in two metropolitan areas. As the founding partner and resident orchestra of the Music Center, the Baltimore SO presents 35 performances in the concert hall annually. In addition to its Baltimore and Strathmore residencies, the orchestra regularly performs in Frederick, its longest continuing run-out concert series, as well as at Chesapeake College in Wye Mills. Notable premieres The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has commissioned several works from American composers, which include: *Christopher Rouse: Symphony No. 1 (1988)Rouse, Christopher (1986).

The Baltimore SO was the first American orchestra in 11 years to tour the Soviet Union after cultural relations resumed towards the end of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Under Zinman the orchestra made its first visits to Chicago and the Midwest in 1990 and to East Asia in 1994, with subsequent East Asia tours in 1997 and 2002. The Baltimore SO has often appeared at Carnegie Hall, including a February 2008 concert with the New York premiere of Steven Mackey's percussion concerto Time Release with soloist Colin Currie.  Community Outreach  The BSO performs approximately 30 education concerts and open rehearsals each year for more than 60,000 area students in pre-school through 12th grade. Cornerstone initiatives include 'BSO on the Go', a program that brings small groups of BSO musicians into schools for interactive music education workshops at no cost to the schools, and 'Side-by-Side' concerts, which allow student musicians to rehearse and perform a full-length concert alongside BSO musicians. Rusty Musicians, a program geared towards adult amateur musicians, allows participants to join the BSO and perform under its conductor. = OrchKids = In May 2008, the BSO began OrchKids, an after-school program to provide music experience and education for youth in Baltimore City's low- income neighborhoods. In collaboration with community partners, it provides music education, instruments, meals and mentorship at no cost to the participants. OrchKids serves more than 400 students from pre-K through fifth grade at Lockerman Bundy Elementary School, New Song Academy, Mary Ann Winterling Elementary School and Highlandtown Elementary/Middle School. OrchKids maintains a faculty of 27 professional working/teaching musicians and academy classroom teachers. Business and community partners include Baltimore City Public Schools, The Peabody Institute, Baltimore School for the Arts, The Family League of Baltimore, University of Maryland Baltimore County and others. Lead funding support was provided by initial gifts of $100,000 from Marin Alsop and $1,000,000 from Rheda Becker and Robert Meyerhoff. The OrchKids program aspires to provide Baltimore City's children tools to expand their opportunities for creativity, self-expression, cooperative learning, teamwork, academic success and self-esteem. = BSO Academy = The BSO Academy is an annual intensive week-long study program that helps amateur musicians improve the skills through learning and performance with the BSO and its conductor.Wakin, Daniel J. \\"Band Camp for Grown-Ups,\\" The New York Times, Sunday, July 15, 2012. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has provided leadership support for the BSO Academy since 2012. = Rusty Musicians = Geared towards adult amateur musicians, \\"Rusty Musicians with the BSO\\" is a programme where for one evening, amateur musicians are invited to join members of the Baltimore SO on stage to rehearse and perform selected repertoire led by Marin Alsop. The first \\"Rusty Musicians\\" event was at Strathmore in February 2010, with more than 400 amateur musicians participating. The program was repeated at Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall in September 2010 with nearly 300 adult amateur participants. = Youth Orchestra = The Baltimore Symphony Youth Orchestras (BSYO), formerly known as the Greater Baltimore Youth Orchestra, came under the umbrella of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 2012. It is made up of three different ensembles, categorized by age group and experience: the String Orchestra, the Concert Orchestra, and the Youth Orchestra.https://www.bsomusic.org/education-community/young- musicians/bsyo.aspxhttps://www.bsomusic.org/media/116011/ORCHESTRA- DESCRIPTIONS.pdf The BSYO performs at the George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology and the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall.

The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 census was 9,993, however, the population is now significantly higher due to the increase in housing developments in the village, including the Buckshaw development. The village is situated just to the west of Chorley, and to the south of Clayton-le-Woods. Euxton is around 2.5 miles from east to west and 2 miles north to south. The village is made up of several areas including Runshaw Moor, Balshaw, Shaw Green, Daisy Hill, Buckshaw, Pincock, Primrose Hill, Glead Hill, Dawbers, Spout Hillock, Culbeck and Pear tree History Euxton's original village settlement in Pincock was based near the ford over the River Yarrow, along the route of the old Roman road Watling Street ‚Äì now the A49 road ‚Äì that runs through the length of the village, from Pincock to Packsaddle. Demonstrating its significance, Euxton had a market charter granted in 1301 by Edward I and whilst the area was called Euxton, the township was called Euxtonburgh. Euxton HallThe manorial seat was Euxton Hall owned first by the Molyneux family and later by the Anderton family. A new manor house is said to have been built in the early 16th century by Hugh Anderton (1466-1516/17). It's likely that the manor would have been located closer to the parish church. A new hall was built by William Anderton (c.1708-44) in 1769 and rebuilt on the same site but on a grander scale in 1850. Euxton Hall is now a private hospital and is made up of the lower ground floor of hall as the upper floor was demolished following a fire. Charles II lodged at Euxton Hall in 1651 when on his way south to Worcester, he is said to have drank water from the stream at the edge of Euxton describing it as \\"Cul Beck\\" or cool brook giving it its name, from whence the area takes its name. The hall had three lodge houses, one at the bottom of Chapel Brow, one at main gates of Euxton Park on Wigan Road and one on Dawber's Lane which is now much extended and known as Dower House. The centre of the village later moved from the old ford to be closer to Euxton Hall and its chapel (now Euxton Parish Church).Euxton Parish Church (geograph 4403183) Buckshaw HallWhilst the oldest extant building is believed to be the parish church and although Euxton Hall is likely to be older in places, dating back to 1662, Armetriding Farm is believed to be the oldest dwelling house. However one of the most significant buildings is Buckshaw Hall, an H-plan two-storey timber framed property on a sandstone base, with both brick and wattle and daub infilling and a slate roof. Euxton Hall Euxton Hall Chapel was designed by architect E. W. Pugin (1834‚Äì1875), and built in 1866 as a private chapel for the Anderton family who lived in Euxton Hall. Early industry Euxton Hall, which was a significant stately residence, now acts as a private hospital and is half its former glory, with the second storey being removed in the latter half of the 19th century along with its grand colonnade. Euxton Hall's 19th century gatehouses can be seen at the bottom of Chapel Brow, near the parish church whilst the other gatehouse can be seen at the entrance of Euxton Hall Gardens. Earlier gatehouses were previously located on Dawbers Lane and Runshaw Lane. Balshaw Lodge, which has recently been redeveloped, was originally built as guest lodgings for the hall. There was a large Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF Chorley) built here in the buildup to the Second World War (Nevell et al., 1999). At its peak the factory employed over 40,000 people, and had its own railway station. It was probably the biggest munitions filling factory in the world, and it is said that the bouncing bombs used in the Dambusters raid were made there. ROF Chorley later came under the ownership of British Aerospace, and in subsequent years was closed down with the land being sold. In the early 2000s the former ROF Chorley site was effectively flattened and sanitised, so that the land could be transformed into the new Buckshaw Village. Modern industry  Plans by Tarmac to operate a sand quarry near the village were approved in August 2008 by a planning inspector. The quarry, to be located between Runshaw Lane and Dawber's Lane, had been proposed for ten years and is opposed by the village council, and by local residents, some of whom set up an action group, Euxton Residents Against Sand Extraction (ERASE), due to its impact on health, traffic and environment locally. The quarry has permission to operate for 15 years. Euxton is home to three listed railway bridges, Pincock Bridge, Old Station Bridge (Wigan Road) and Bay Horse Brow (Euxton Lane). There is also a bridge on School Lane. Estates and public houses The village also has seven public houses; the Talbot, the Euxton Mills, the Railway at Euxton, the Bay Horse, the Traveller's Rest, the Plough and the War Horse (in the Buckshaw part of Euxton). Euxton Mills - geograph.org.uk - 1536029 Euxton has several large housing estates, particularly in the eastern half of the village built in the late 1960s by Trevor Hemmings. The Talbot Estate lies to the east of Euxton and the Greenside Estate to the north on Runshaw Lane. 430x430px Newer housing estates include Wentworth Drive to the north-east of the village and Church Walk and Park Avenue to the west.  Transport  Euxton has two railway stations. It's connected to Liverpool and Preston via the West Coast Main Line at Euxton Balshaw Lane railway station and to Chorley and Manchester via Buckshaw Parkway railway station. In 1997, Euxton Balshaw Lane railway station was re-opened after a gap of some 30 years. It is on the Preston - Wigan West Coast Main Line. The nearby station, Buckshaw Parkway was opened in 2011 to serve the new Buckshaw Village development, and is on the Preston - Manchester line. In addition Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire operate the Route 109 through the village to provide a connection to Chorley, Leyland, Clayton-le-Woods and Preston. The Route 10, 11, 12 and 16 also ran through Euxton until 2012. Stagecoach also planned to extend the Route 111 to Chorley via Euxton, however these plans were abandoned after Lancashire County Council removed funding. The Route 109/A passed through the north of Euxton past Runshaw College, but was axed following a claim from Stagecoach that too few paying passengers used it. Preston Bus operate the Route 347 to Southport bi- hourly on weekdays. Sport The former ROF Chorley sports ground was used by English Championship football team Bolton Wanderers as its training headquarters. On 19 February 2016, the training facility was sold by Bolton Wanderers to Wigan Athletic.Wigan Athletic buy struggling Bolton Wanderers' Euxton training facility, BBC Sport, 19 February 2006 The village is also home to Euxton Corinthians F.C., Euxton Villa F.C., Euxton Girls F.C. and Euxton Cricket Club.

The film features a final sequence in Technicolor. It was the first film by Sidney Franklin for MGM.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30 by The American Film Institute, c.1971 The story was filmed before in 1914 by the Biograph Company.

In the meantime, she falls for her bodyguard Dantan (Moreno). Cast * Marion Davies as Beverly Calhoun * Antonio Moreno as Dantan * Creighton Hale as Prince Oscar * Roy D'Arcy as General Marlanax * Albert Gran as Duke Travina * Paulette Duval as Carlotta * Max Barwyn as Saranoff * Charles Clary as Mr. Calhoun Production In her 22nd film, Marion Davies starred in yet another dual role as the American Beverly Calhoun who masquerades as her cousin Oscar, who happens to be the Prince of Graustark, a small European monarchy. This was the second time that Davies masqueraded as a male (see Little Old New York), and critics and audiences applauded the effort. The film is often cited as Davies' most profitable film because of low production costs and big box office. The only problem in filming was Davies' 10-day bout with the flu. This was her first teaming with Antonio Moreno, who played the royal bodyguard. The film boasted a 2-strip Technicolor finale (which survives).

Chess career In 1912 Breyer won the Hungarian championship in Temesvar. In a 1920 tournament in Berlin he finished first (+6‚àí2=1) ahead of Efim Bogoljubov, Savielly Tartakower, Richard R√©ti, G√©za Mar√≥czy, and Siegbert Tarrasch. Breyer had a plus record against Max Euwe (later world champion). In 1921 Breyer set a new blindfold chess record by playing 25 games simultaneously. He also edited Szellemi Sport, a magazine devoted to chess puzzles, and composed at least one brilliant retrograde analysis study. Heart disease cut short Breyer's promising chess career. He died in 1921 at the age of 28 in Bratislava. He was buried in Bratislava and after exhumation in 1987, was reburied in the Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest. Legacy Breyer was a leading pioneer of the hypermodern school of chess theory, which favoured controlling the with pressure from the . He is noted for the maxim \\"after the first move 1.e4 White's game is in the last throes\\", although Breyer himself did not abandon that move.

Treasure Island is a former Boy Scout property located between Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania and Frenchtown, New Jersey, United States. The property is situated on two islands in the middle of the Delaware River and was owned by the Cradle of Liberty Council. Treasure Island was the oldest continually operated Boy Scout Camp in the country and had been continuously associated with Scouting since 1913. In April 2005, storms caused some of the highest flooding since 1955. As a result, Treasure Island was closed to summer campers in 2005 for the first time in twenty-five years. The council spent more than $1-million to rehabilitate the camp in preparation for reopening in June 2006. On June 28, 2006, the camp was once again inundated. While its long-term future was in doubt, it opened again successfully in 2007 and 2008. However, on September 10, 2008, the Council Executive Board voted to close Treasure Island for the 2009 season, the camp remained closed for the 2010 season and is now permanently shuttered. It was announced on March 2, 2018 that Treasure Island was sold to Haubert Outdoor Oriented Adventure Hospitality, LLC, a family-owned business that intends to re-open the historic property as a commercial family campground. Once re- opened, Haubert will make Treasure Island available to Scouts free of charge. Structures Among the important buildings on the island are the Kiwanis Lodge (HandiCraft), the Klein Lodge (nature), the Health Lodge, the Trading Post, and \\"City Hall\\", which was the main office in control of Treasure Island. During the summer, most of the lodges were used for merit badge instruction. There is also the Goodman Stockade, where the opening campfires are held on Sunday nights, and the Ceremonial Grounds, where the Order of the Arrow ceremonies and the Friday night closing campfire were held. he stone fixtures of the Ceremonial Grounds, where the Order of the Arrow ceremonies were held, were excavated, transported, and reassembled at a new location within the Summit Bechtel Scout Reserve in West Virginia. Treasure Island has a swimming pool, and boating was conducted in canoes, rowboats and Sunfish sailboats on the west side of the island at the Boathouse. Camp program Screenshot from Council webpage Tube rafting was offered to Scouts during the summer, and scouts floated downstream to Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania, where they were driven by bus back up to the mainland across from Treasure Island, and taken by a boat back to the island. Bike and canoe trips in the surrounding area were also conducted along the old Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal. Climbing and rappelling trips also took place at Ralph Stover State Park. Marshall Island Just to the north of Treasure Island lies Marshall Island (also known as Eagle Island). Marshall Island is connected to Treasure Island only by a small footbridge. Treasure Island is in New Jersey, whereas Marshall Island is in Pennsylvania. Because of this, the archery and rifle Ranges were sited on Marshall Island because New Jersey state gun laws are more stringent. There is a path leading from the archery and rifle ranges that runs north and branches off in two directions. The branch to the left leads to a series of abandoned buildings and an abandoned field, remaining from when Eagle Island operated as a separate camp (Camp Wilson) in the 1970s. The right branch leads to unused campsites and the C.O.P.E. course. Order of the Arrow In 1915 the Order of the Arrow (OA) was founded at Treasure Island by the Camp Director, E. Urner Goodman, and Assistant Camp Director Carroll A. Edson. The W. W. W. (the original name of the OA in the Lenni Lenape language) was designed as a camp honor fraternity that would emphasize the ideals of Scouting through the use of ceremonies and American Indian lore. At the beginning of the camping season, Goodman explored the island to find a suitable site for the Council Fire and for the rituals of his new program. A natural amphitheater was chosen on the south side of the island that was secluded from the rest of the camp. On the day of the first induction campfire, July 16, 1915, Goodman and one of his staff members, Harry A. Yoder, cleared the brush for the new ceremonial grounds, built the altar, and cut a trail leading from the camp. This new ceremonial ring continued to be used for OA ceremonies and for the camp's campfire programs until Treasure Island closed. At the end of the camping season that year, the new Order contained twenty-five members who selected the totem and names for Unami Lodge.

It is the home of the Silver Age version of the Flash (Barry Allen), and first appeared in Showcase No. 4 in September‚ÄìOctober 1956.  Location  Central City's location has been vaguely defined over the years, similar to DC's other fictional cities such as Gotham City and Metropolis. In the 1970s, Central City was stated as being located in Ohio, where the real- world city of Athens, Ohio,Bob Rozakis, \\"Ask the Answer Man,\\" Daily Planet, Detective Comics No. 470 (June 1907) would be (as shown in Flash #228 in 1974). Bob Rozakis' Ask the Answer Man column also stated that Central City was located in Ohio in 1987's Flash (volume 2) #2, published just after the reality-altering storyline Crisis on Infinite Earths. More recently, Central City has most often been located in the state of Missouri.The Flash vol. 2 No. 188 (September 2002) Maps in Young Justice place Central City in Missouri across from Keystone City, Kansas. Additionally, the 2014 television series The Flash also places Central City in Missouri (although opening scenes show Portland, Oregon), most explicitly in a letter sent to S.T.A.R. Labs in the episode \\"The Man in the Yellow Suit.\\" Portland, Oregon is also the city-scape in the episode \\"Flash vs The Arrow\\" in season 1 of the series.TV series, The Flash (EP8 SE1) Season 4, episode 13: True Colors mentions Central City being located in the Midwest. In season 6, episode 6, the location of Central City is shown through the targeting system of the Ring of Fire. The location points to the Richmond, Virginia metro area. In the episode \\"Bloodlines\\" of the Young Justice cartoon, (a facsimile of) the St. Louis Gateway Arch can be seen in the background of scenes depicting Central City.  Statistics  Central City's population has been depicted as dynamic over the years. In Flash v2, No. 2 (1987) it was cited as being 290,000. In 1990, the Atlas of the DC Universe listed it as 750,000. As of Flash Secret Files and Origins 2010, the population stands as 1,395,600. In Flash v.4 # 1, Central City Police Captain Darryl Frye is quoted as describing the population as having \\"tripled\\" during Barry Allen's years-long absence. Caitlin Snow mentioned the city population as 14,000,000 in The Death of Vibe episode of The Flash (Season 5, episode 3 of the 2014 TV series).  Notable residents  From 1956 until approximately 1985 (in publishing years), Central City was defended by the Flash (police scientist Barry Allen) against a myriad of foes, including Gorilla Grodd, Captain Cold, the Weather Wizard, the Mirror Master, and Eobard Thawne (The \\"Reverse-Flash\\"). After Barry's death in Crisis on Infinite Earth, most of his foes, as well as Barry's successor (and former sidekick) Wally West moved to Keystone City, which thanks to the reality-altering effects of Crisis on Infinite Earth, was now Central City's twin city (pre-Crisis on Infinite Earth, Keystone City was located on the parallel Earth known as Earth-Two, in approximately the same space as Central City). Subsequently, Central City was treated as a relatively quiet venue that was not frequently depicted in DC comic book stories, but this situation has changed as a result of Barry Allen's recent return as the Flash. Not long after Allen's death, in Crisis on Infinite Earths No. 4 (August 1987), Central City was depicted as experiencing a wave of racial violence, caused or at least exacerbated by politician and white supremacist W. James Heller; in his costumed identity of supposed super- hero William Hell, Heller captured only non-white criminals (creating the false impression that non-whites were primarily responsible for Central City's criminal activity) and recruited white criminals for his \\"Aryan Empire\\" organization. When Heller attempted to incite further violence at a political rally, Suicide Squad member Deadshot impersonated William Hell to oppose Heller's racist rhetoric, turning Heller's own charade against him, since the costumed \\"hero\\" proved more popular with the public than any politician. Heller quickly donned his costume to, as William Hell, denounce Deadshot/Hell as an impostor, and in the ensuing conflict, William Hell (Heller) was wounded and his injuries blamed on Heller's followers, partially defusing Central City's racial strife. The robotic superhero and former Teen Titans member Cyborg has moved to Central City; part of this is hoping to establish himself as the town's resident hero.Flash (vol. 2) No. 180 (January 2002)  Geography, institutions and landmarks  During the years in which the second Flash series was written by Cary Bates, Central City was apparently divided into Upper and Lower East and West Sides, as well as a \\"downtown\\" region. Central City is the home of the Flash Museum, a museum dedicated to the exploits and memorabilia of the city's hero. Central City's main newspaper is the Central City Citizen (previously the Central City Picture-News), for which Barry's wife Iris West Allen is currently once again a reporter after an absence of several years. Central City is home to the \\"Central City Cougars\\", an American Football team who is a member of the NFL's AFC Central Division.The Flash: Season Zero Vol 1 #4 (March 2015) As seen in Flash Vol. 2 #177, it has developed a thriving theatre district, second only to New York City.

During the late 19th century, the post served as a centre for trading activities, including the illegal whisky trade. The sale of whisky was outlawed but, due to the lack of law enforcement in the region prior to 1874, many whisky traders had settled in the area and taken to charging unusually high prices for their goods. Fort Whoop-Up is also the name of a replica site and interpretive centre built in Indian Battle Park.  Construction  Fort Hamilton was first built in 1869 by John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton‚Äîtwo traders who had done business in the Fort Benton area of Montana and in the basin of the Upper Missouri‚Äîto serve as a trading post. Fort Hamilton was originally a group of 11 cabins. The traders in these cabins traded for $50,000 worth of buffalo robes in just six months of operations. This first fort was destroyed by fire within a year of its construction by an overturned lamp. Whether this was an accident or deliberate arson is unknown.Harris, Howell, cited in Fort Whoop-Up in 1881 Healy and Hamilton contracted James Gladstone and a crew of 30 workers to construct a second, more secure fort, which was later nicknamed Fort Whoop-Up.Rocky Mountain Gazette, Dec. 26, 1870 It took two years to build at a cost of $25,000. When it was finished, Fort Whoop-Up was \\"a squared timber post complete with a stockade, cannon-mounted bastions, loopholes for firing rifles, and three wickets for trading with the aboriginals.\\" According to Healy, the new fort was built with six thousand cottonwood logs.Adney, E. Tappen. Paper. Letter, John Healy to Tappen Adney, 25 August 1905. Montana Historical Society, Helena. Fort Whoop-Up was located at the junction of the Belly (Oldman) River and the St. Mary's River, south of where the Fort Whoop-Up interpretive centre is located.  Trade and enforcement  One type of alcohol sold by the whisky traders in and around Whoop-Up bandits was known as Whoop-Up Bug Juice, a highly prized alcohol spiked with ginger, molasses, and red pepper. It was then coloured with black chewing tobacco, watered down, and boiled to make \\"firewater\\". The spread of American traders from Fort Benton north into Canada was spurred by the enforcement of prohibition in Montana in 1869. Traders, like Healy and Hamilton, brought their stockpile of whisky to Canada to continue their lucrative trade. While whisky was a foundational trading item at Fort Whoop-Up and other trading posts, there was much legal trading that occurred, such as trading blankets, food, firearms, or ammunition for buffalo robes. The outlaws of Fort Whoop-Up and surrounding areas‚Äîcombined with the supposed flying of an American flag over Canadian territory‚Äîcontributed to the formation of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP). Fort Whoop-Up was a destination on their march west in 1874. The NWMP arrived at Fort Whoop-Up in October 1874, with the task of establishing Canadian sovereignty in the territory and controlling the alcohol trade. They found no whisky on the premises and the flag that had been reported as an American flag was inspected and found to be a trade flag for the fort (later adopted by the City of Lethbridge as the municipal flag). Finding no reason to close the fort, they continued further west and the fort continued in the trade of legal goods. Their first strike on the alcohol traders came after a Peigan chief named Three Bulls complained at Fort Macleod about a group of whisky traders who had sold him overpriced whisky. Shortly after, the NWMP caught and fined the perpetrators, although they were not at Fort Whoop-Up at the time.Sessional Papers of Canada, Report of the Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, 1874, p. 59-61, Letter of Col. James Macleod, October 30, 1874 Although the presence of the NWMP decreased the abundance of whisky trading, it still occurred. In 1875, the NWMP rented a room from the owners of the fort, Healy and Hamilton, and established a post there.Report of the British War Office on the Cypress Hills Massacre 1875 This arrangement lasted for at least twelve years, the fort acting as both a trading post and a NWMP post. The following year, Healy and Hamilton sold the fort to Dave Akers, who was in control of the fort almost until its demise. The fort was again burned in 1888, the fire having started in the NWMP barracks. This fire was not as severe as only the NWMP barracks were destroyed. The fort remained in operation until it was deserted somewhere between 1890 and 1892. It was then destroyed piece by piece until the last of it was washed away in a flood in 1915. On 28 June 1985 Canada Post issued 'Fort Whoop Up, Alta.' one of the 20 stamps in the \\"Forts Across Canada Series\\" (1983 & 1985). The stamps are perforated 12¬Ω x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited based on the designs by Rolf P. Harder.Canada Post issued 'Fort Whoop Up, Alta.' Name There are several theories as to why the fort was nicknamed Whoop-Up. The most prominent is that it came by a description of the illicit activities that were taking place at the fort; that people said they were going to Fort Hamilton to whoop it up. Another theory comes from the process of getting a bull train moving over the trail. The bull whacker would walk alongside the bull train and crack his whip. This process was called whooping them up, which may have led to naming the trail from Fort Benton, Montana the Whoop-Up Trail, and hence the fort as well. Reconstruction A reconstruction‚Äîeffort was undertaken to adapt the fort to what it was originally, based on new photographic evidence. The replica site was built as a centennial project, downstream from the original site, in 1967. Since then, various new exhibits have been unveiled, including the Thunderchief Collection, showcasing artifacts from the local Blackfoot culture; the Shockley Firearms Gallery; and Voice from the Past, an audio program that enables visitors and school children to receive guided tours year round. Seasonal re-enactments take place in the summer involving characters from the fort's history, and are done in partnership with Drama Nutz Productions and Guns of the Golden West, as well as local re-enactment talent.

To this end, supercomputers are often employed to study black holes, gravitational waves, neutron stars and many other phenomena governed by Einstein's theory of general relativity. A currently active field of research in numerical relativity is the simulation of relativistic binaries and their associated gravitational waves. Other branches are also active. Overview A primary goal of numerical relativity is to study spacetimes whose exact form is not known. The spacetimes so found computationally can either be fully dynamical, stationary or static and may contain matter fields or vacuum. In the case of stationary and static solutions, numerical methods may also be used to study the stability of the equilibrium spacetimes. In the case of dynamical spacetimes, the problem may be divided into the initial value problem and the evolution, each requiring different methods. Numerical relativity is applied to many areas, such as cosmological models, critical phenomena, perturbed black holes and neutron stars, and the coalescence of black holes and neutron stars, for example. In any of these cases, Einstein's equations can be formulated in several ways that allow us to evolve the dynamics. While Cauchy methods have received a majority of the attention, characteristic and Regge calculus based methods have also been used. All of these methods begin with a snapshot of the gravitational fields on some hypersurface, the initial data, and evolve these data to neighboring hypersurfaces. Like all problems in numerical analysis, careful attention is paid to the stability and convergence of the numerical solutions. In this line, much attention is paid to the gauge conditions, coordinates, and various formulations of the Einstein equations and the effect they have on the ability to produce accurate numerical solutions. Numerical relativity research is distinct from work on classical field theories as many techniques implemented in these areas are inapplicable in relativity. Many facets are however shared with large scale problems in other computational sciences like computational fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, and solid mechanics. Numerical relativists often work with applied mathematicians and draw insight from numerical analysis, scientific computation, partial differential equations, and geometry among other mathematical areas of specialization. History =Foundations in theory= Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915. It, like his earlier theory of special relativity, described space and time as a unified spacetime subject to what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These form a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). After more than 100 years since the first publication of the theory, relatively few closed-form solutions are known for the field equations, and, of those, most are cosmological solutions that assume special symmetry to reduce the complexity of the equations. The field of numerical relativity emerged from the desire to construct and study more general solutions to the field equations by approximately solving the Einstein equations numerically. A necessary precursor to such attempts was a decomposition of spacetime back into separated space and time. This was first published by Richard Arnowitt, Stanley Deser, and Charles W. Misner in the late 1950s in what has become known as the ADM formalism. Although for technical reasons the precise equations formulated in the original ADM paper are rarely used in numerical simulations, most practical approaches to numerical relativity use a \\"3+1 decomposition\\" of spacetime into three- dimensional space and one-dimensional time that is closely related to the ADM formulation, because the ADM procedure reformulates the Einstein field equations into a constrained initial value problem that can be addressed using computational methodologies. At the time that ADM published their original paper, computer technology would not have supported numerical solution to their equations on any problem of any substantial size. The first documented attempt to solve the Einstein field equations numerically appears to be Hahn and Lindquist in 1964, followed soon thereafter by Smarr and by Eppley. These early attempts were focused on evolving Misner data in axisymmetry (also known as \\"2+1 dimensions\\"). At around the same time Tsvi Piran wrote the first code that evolved a system with gravitational radiation using a cylindrical symmetry. In this calculation Piran has set the foundation for many of the concepts used today in evolving ADM equations, like \\"free evolution\\" versus \\"constrained evolution\\", which deal with the fundamental problem of treating the constraint equations that arise in the ADM formalism. Applying symmetry reduced the computational and memory requirements associated with the problem, allowing the researchers to obtain results on the supercomputers available at the time. =Early results= The first realistic calculations of rotating collapse were carried out in the early eighties by Richard Stark and Tsvi Piran in which the gravitational wave forms resulting from formation of a rotating black hole were calculated for the first time. For nearly 20 years following the initial results, there were fairly few other published results in numerical relativity, probably due to the lack of sufficiently powerful computers to address the problem. In the late 1990s, the Binary Black Hole Grand Challenge Alliance successfully simulated a head-on binary black hole collision. As a post-processing step the group computed the event horizon for the spacetime. This result still required imposing and exploiting axisymmetry in the calculations. Some of the first documented attempts to solve the Einstein equations in three dimensions were focused on a single Schwarzschild black hole, which is described by a static and spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein field equations. This provides an excellent test case in numerical relativity because it does have a closed-form solution so that numerical results can be compared to an exact solution, because it is static, and because it contains one of the most numerically challenging features of relativity theory, a physical singularity. One of the earliest groups to attempt to simulate this solution was Anninos et al. in 1995. In their paper they point out that :\\"Progress in three dimensional numerical relativity has been impeded in part by lack of computers with sufficient memory and computational power to perform well resolved calculations of 3D spacetimes.\\" =Maturation of the field= In the years that followed, not only did computers become more powerful, but also various research groups developed alternate techniques to improve the efficiency of the calculations. With respect to black hole simulations specifically, two techniques were devised to avoid problems associated with the existence of physical singularities in the solutions to the equations: (1) Excision, and (2) the \\"puncture\\" method. In addition the Lazarus group developed techniques for using early results from a short-lived simulation solving the nonlinear ADM equations, in order to provide initial data for a more stable code based on linearized equations derived from perturbation theory. More generally, adaptive mesh refinement techniques, already used in computational fluid dynamics were introduced to the field of numerical relativity. Excision In the excision technique, which was first proposed in the late 1990s, a portion of a spacetime inside of the event horizon surrounding the singularity of a black hole is simply not evolved. In theory this should not affect the solution to the equations outside of the event horizon because of the principle of causality and properties of the event horizon (i.e. nothing physical inside the black hole can influence any of the physics outside the horizon). Thus if one simply does not solve the equations inside the horizon one should still be able to obtain valid solutions outside. One \\"excises\\" the interior by imposing ingoing boundary conditions on a boundary surrounding the singularity but inside the horizon. While the implementation of excision has been very successful, the technique has two minor problems. The first is that one has to be careful about the coordinate conditions. While physical effects cannot propagate from inside to outside, coordinate effects could. For example, if the coordinate conditions were elliptical, coordinate changes inside could instantly propagate out through the horizon. This then means that one needs hyperbolic type coordinate conditions with characteristic velocities less than that of light for the propagation of coordinate effects (e.g., using harmonic coordinates coordinate conditions). The second problem is that as the black holes move, one must continually adjust the location of the excision region to move with the black hole. The excision technique was developed over several years including the development of new gauge conditions that increased stability and work that demonstrated the ability of the excision regions to move through the computational grid. The first stable, long-term evolution of the orbit and merger of two black holes using this technique was published in 2005. Punctures In the puncture method the solution is factored into an analytical part, which contains the singularity of the black hole, and a numerically constructed part, which is then singularity free. This is a generalization of the Brill-Lindquist prescription for initial data of black holes at rest and can be generalized to the Bowen-York prescription for spinning and moving black hole initial data. Until 2005, all published usage of the puncture method required that the coordinate position of all punctures remain fixed during the course of the simulation. Of course black holes in proximity to each other will tend to move under the force of gravity, so the fact that the coordinate position of the puncture remained fixed meant that the coordinate systems themselves became \\"stretched\\" or \\"twisted,\\" and this typically led to numerical instabilities at some stage of the simulation. Breakthrough In 2005 researchers demonstrated for the first time the ability to allow punctures to move through the coordinate system, thus eliminating some of the earlier problems with the method. This allowed accurate long-term evolutions of black holes. By choosing appropriate coordinate conditions and making crude analytic assumption about the fields near the singularity (since no physical effects can propagate out of the black hole, the crudeness of the approximations does not matter), numerical solutions could be obtained to the problem of two black holes orbiting each other, as well as accurate computation of gravitational radiation (ripples in spacetime) emitted by them. Lazarus project The Lazarus project (1998‚Äì2005) was developed as a post-Grand Challenge technique to extract astrophysical results from short lived full numerical simulations of binary black holes. It combined approximation techniques before (post-Newtonian trajectories) and after (perturbations of single black holes) with full numerical simulations attempting to solve General Relativity field equations. All previous attempts to numerically integrate in supercomputers the Hilbert- Einstein equations describing the gravitational field around binary black holes led to software failure before a single orbit was completed. The Lazarus approach, in the meantime, gave the best insight into the binary black hole problem and produced numerous and relatively accurate results, such as the radiated energy and angular momentum emitted in the latest merging state, the linear momentum radiated by unequal mass holes, and the final mass and spin of the remnant black hole. The method also computed detailed gravitational waves emitted by the merger process and predicted that the collision of black holes is the most energetic single event in the Universe, releasing more energy in a fraction of a second in the form of gravitational radiation than an entire galaxy in its lifetime. Adaptive mesh refinement Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) as a numerical method has roots that go well beyond its first application in the field of numerical relativity. Mesh refinement first appears in the numerical relativity literature in the 1980s, through the work of Choptuik in his studies of critical collapse of scalar fields. The original work was in one dimension, but it was subsequently extended to two dimensions. In two dimensions, AMR has also been applied to the study of inhomogeneous cosmologies, and to the study of Schwarzschild black holes. The technique has now become a standard tool in numerical relativity and has been used to study the merger of black holes and other compact objects in addition to the propagation of gravitational radiation generated by such astronomical events. Recent developments In the past few years, hundreds of research papers have been published leading to a wide spectrum of mathematical relativity, gravitational wave, and astrophysical results for the orbiting black hole problem. This technique extended to astrophysical binary systems involving neutron stars and black holes, and multiple black holes. One of the most surprising predictions is that the merger of two black holes can give the remnant hole a speed of up to 4000 km/s that can allow it to escape from any known galaxy. The simulations also predict an enormous release of gravitational energy in this merger process, amounting up to 8% of its total rest mass.

At a surgery, constituents may raise issues of concern in the same manner that a person may directly consult a General Practitioner in their surgery (a \\"surgery\\" being the term for the GP's workplace, an \\"office\\" in American parlance). The issues may relate to local issues (street crime, litter, a request for intervention by the representative on behalf of the constituent with local or national government) or to national policy matters. Often the constituent's issue will be followed up by a caseworker or assistant. Surgery meetings are usually confidential and differ from town hall meetings, which are open to many people at the same time. It is up to each MP to decide whether they have any surgeries at all and if so, how many and in what locations. MPs often use local party offices, church halls or rooms in public houses as the venues, with a number of surgeries possibly being held at different locations around a constituency. Surgeries are traditionally held on Fridays or at weekends when MPs have returned from sittings of parliament in Westminster. Some MPs' surgeries are \\"appointment only\\", some \\"drop-in\\", and others a mix. An MP with a large constituency will sometimes hold surgeries in a wide range of locations during the summer recess. In Republic of Ireland, clinics/surgeries are an even more important source of publicity and contact for Teachta√≠ D√°la (TDs) and other representatives, as under the PR-STV system there are very few truly safe seats. One paper published by Queen's University Belfast's Institute of Irish Studies states The term mobile office has been used in Australian politics.
