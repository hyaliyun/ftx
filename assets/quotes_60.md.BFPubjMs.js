Another section of the train started in Amsterdam and was coupled to the Hoek cars in Utrecht. The Rheingold ran along the Rhine River via Arnhem, Netherlands, and Cologne, Germany, using special luxury coaches. It was named after Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold opera, which romanticized the Rhine. From 1965 until the train's discontinuation in 1987, the Rheingold was a first-class-only Trans Europ Express (TEE) train.

At Hoek van Holland, the train had timed connections for ship service to and from Harwich, England. The Geneva‚ÄìBasel section was added in 1965 and was discontinued in 1980/82 (see later section for details).  Pre- World War II  Interior of a first class coach belonging to the Rheingold in September 1930 The first Rheingold, which was classified as a Fernschnellzug (FD) (trains FFD 101 and FFD 102), started service on May 15, 1928. In the Netherlands it was pulled by the NS 3700-3800-3900 steam locomotive series, in Germany by the Baureihen 183 (Badic IV h, between Mannheim and Basel) and BR 184-5 (Bavarian S 3/6, between Emmerich and Mannheim) and in Switzerland by Ae 4/7 electric locomotives. In 1930, the BR 01 (01 077-181) was used between Mannheim and Basel and permanently from 1935 on, and the NS 3900 in the Netherlands. The luxurious Pullman-type coaches had a distinct cream/blue livery in 1st and 2nd class, each measuring . At both ends (one behind the locomotive) there was a blue luggage wagon. Some cars had a kitchen, with one kitchen serving two cars. Mitropa waiters served the passengers. The cars were the most technically advanced the DRG had at that time, but were less advanced than the later (from 1939) Sch√ºrzenwagen (skirted coaches), typical World War II cars. The interiors were designed by artists and architects of the time, and besides being very luxurious were also very spacious. In total, there were 26 coaches and three luggage wagons per train consist. In these days, the trip took 11 hours. At first, the cars had the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft and MITROPA inscriptions with the DRG logo. Around 1931 the name RHEINGOLD was printed on the coaches and the locomotive tender, and the DRG logo remained. In the fall of 1939, due to the start of World War II, the train service was cancelled.  Post-World War II  The service was reestablished in 1951 as the Fernzug (F) Rheingold Express (train numbers F 163/164, later F 9/10 and F 21/22). Most cars survived the war but nevertheless the coaches in Western Germany were painted over and rebuilt to dining coaches (Gesellschaftwagen), long distance coaches (F trains) and short distance train coaches (D trains). The Rheingold now used skirted coaches and was pulled by the Deutsche Bundesbahn steam locomotives BR 01, BR 01.10, BR 03 and BR 03.10 and the BR 41 between Cologne and Kaldenkirchen. In 1954, \\"Express\\" was dropped from the train's name.  TEE Rheingold  Interior of a preserved ex-Rheingold dome car. In 1962, the Rheingold became established again as a link between Switzerland and the Netherlands on the pre-war route, and carrying first-class cars only. In 1965, it became a Trans Europ Express (or Trans-Europe Express). New rolling stock introduced starting in 1962 included dome cars, one per train, used only on the Rheingold and Rheinpfeil (Rhine Arrow). In Europe, the use of dome cars was unique to these two trains. After the Rheinpfeil was integrated into the Bundesbahn's new Intercity network in 1971, the TEE Erasmus began using the displaced dome cars, along with the Rheingold.Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (March 29‚ÄìApril 25, 1974 edition), p. 69, 466 The dome cars were withdrawn on 30 May 1976.Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (July 1976 edition), p. 75. Peterborough, England: Thomas Cook Publishing. The new cars, together with improvements to the track along parts of its route in the mid-1960s, made the Rheingold the fastest train in Germany. In 1964, the train was scheduled to cover the Freiburg ‚Äì Karlsruhe section in 59 minutes, working out to an average speed of , which was the \\"fastest schedule in German rail history\\" up to that time. Until about 1972 the train's all-first-class, red-and-cream cars were pulled by Class E 10.12 electric locomotives painted in blue-and-cream, but later the red-and-cream Class 103 locomotives took over.

However, during certain times of the year both before 1982 and continuing after, the train carried through coaches to Chur and (until 1985) Milan, which were attached to ordinary express trains south of Basel. Starting in 1983,Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (May 29‚ÄìJune 30, 1983 edition), pp. 6 and 66. Thomas Cook Publishing. the Rheingold had a branch to Munich, which separated at Mannheim from the main train (which continued south to Basel). It provided through TEE service between Amsterdam and Munich, also serving Heidelberg, Stuttgart and Augsburg, among other cities, en route. Until 1985, it operated during the summer timetable periods only (circa late May until late September each year). It was introduced on 29 May 1983 and ran until 24 September of that year. This variant was repeated the following summer and again in summer 1985, and then became year-round. During 1985 and 1986, this branch extended beyond Munich to serve one additional city, terminating in Salzburg, Austria. Although the Mannheim ‚Äì Munich section became year-round at this time (mid-1985), the new Munich ‚Äì Salzburg section ran only in summer, operating for the last time on 27 September 1986.Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (September 28‚ÄìOctober 31, 1986 edition), pp. 6, 66.

It can be used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks. InDesign can also publish content suitable for tablet devices in conjunction with Adobe Digital Publishing Suite. Graphic designers and production artists are the principal users, creating and laying out periodical publications, posters, and print media. It also supports export to EPUB and SWF formats to create e-books and digital publications, including digital magazines, and content suitable for consumption on tablet computers. In addition, InDesign supports XML, style sheets, and other coding markup, making it suitable for exporting tagged text content for use in other digital and online formats. The Adobe InCopy word processor uses the same formatting engine as InDesign. History InDesign is the successor to Adobe PageMaker, which was acquired by Adobe with the purchase of Aldus in late 1994. (Freehand, a competitor to Adobe Illustrator and also made by Aldus, was sold to Altsys, the maker of Fontographer.) By 1998 Page Maker had lost almost the entire professional market to the comparatively feature-rich QuarkXPress 3.3, released in 1992, and 4.0, released in 1996. Quark stated its intention to buy out Adobe and to divest the combined company of PageMaker to avoid anti-trust issues. Adobe rebuffed the Quark offer and instead continued to work on a new page layout application. The project had been started by Aldus and was code-named \\"Shuksan\\". It was later code-named \\"K2\\" and was released as InDesign 1.0 in 1999. The new InDesign software was initially launched in the UK through a series of promotional hotel meetings. The marketing concentrated on mention of new software architecture ‚Äî a small central software kernel (about 2Mb) to which add-ons would be bolted as the program's functionality expanded in later versions. This sounded impressive. However, the PS Printer Driver for InDesign 1.0 was an external app that tended to acquire frequent corruption problems, requiring periodic re-installs of this item. Copies of InDesign 1.5 were usually given away when it was found that a host of bugs had to be corrected. By InDesign 2.0 the temperamental Printer Driver became embedded within the main software. The celebrated 'kernel' architecture was never mentioned again. InDesign was the first Mac OS X-native desktop publishing (DTP) software. In version 3 (InDesign CS) it received a boost in distribution by being bundled with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat in Creative Suite. InDesign exports documents in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) and has multilingual support. It was the first DTP application to support Unicode for text processing, advanced typography with OpenType fonts, advanced transparency features, layout styles, optical margin alignment, and cross-platform scripting using JavaScript. Later versions of the software introduced new file formats. To support the new features, especially typographic, introduced with InDesign CS, both the program and its document format are not backward- compatible. Instead, InDesign CS2 introduced the INX (.inx) format, an XML- based document representation, to allow backwards compatibility with future versions. InDesign CS versions updated with the 3.1 April 2005 update can read InDesign CS2-saved files exported to the .inx format. The InDesign Interchange format does not support versions earlier than InDesign CS. With InDesign CS4, Adobe replaced INX with InDesign Markup Language (IDML), another XML-based document representation. Adobe worked on the provision of a 'Drag and Drop' feature and this became available after 2004 but was restricted to dropping graphics and images, not text. Adobe developed InDesign CS3 (and Creative Suite 3) as universal binary software compatible with native Intel and PowerPC Macs in 2007, two years after the announced 2005 schedule, inconveniencing early adopters of Intel-based Macs. Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen had announced that \\"Adobe will be first with a complete line of universal applications\\".San Francisco - Live Coverage of Steve Jobs Keynote 1:00PM EDT, June 6th, 2005, WWDC 2005 - Live Coverage of Keynote, The Mac Observer The CS2 Mac version had code tightly integrated to the PPC architecture, and not natively compatible with the Intel processors in Apple's new machines, so porting the products to another platform was more difficult than had been anticipated. Adobe developed the CS3 application integrating Macromedia products (2005), rather than recompiling CS2 and simultaneously developing CS3. By this time 'Drag and Drop' of type was made available. =InDesign and Leopard= InDesign CS3 initially had a serious compatibility issue with Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5), as Adobe stated: \\"InDesign CS3 may unexpectedly quit when using the Place, Save, Save As or Export commands using either the OS or Adobe dialog boxes.

Internationalization and localization InDesign Middle Eastern editions come with special settings for laying out Arabic or Hebrew text. They feature: * Text settings: Special settings for laying out Arabic or Hebrew text, such as: *# Ability to use Arabic, Persian or Hindi digits; *# Use kashidas for letter spacing and full justification; *# Ligature option; *# Adjust the position of diacritics, such as vowels of the Arabic script; *# Justify text in three possible ways: Standard, Arabic, Naskh; *# Option to insert special characters, including Geresh, Gershayim, Maqaf for Hebrew and Kashida for Arabic texts; *# Apply standard, Arabic or Hebrew styles for page, paragraph and footnote numbering. * Bi-directional text flow: The notion of right-to-left behavior applies to several objects: Story, paragraph, character and table. It allows mixing right-to-left and left-to-right words, paragraphs and stories in a document. It is possible to change the direction of neutral characters (e.g. / or ?) according to the user's keyboard language. * Table of contents: Provides a set of table of contents titles, one for each supported language. This table is sorted according to the chosen language. InDesign CS4 Middle Eastern versions allows users to choose the language of the index title and cross-references. * Indices: Allows creating of a simple keyword index or a somewhat more detailed index of the information in the text using embedded indexing codes. Unlike more sophisticated programs, InDesign is incapable of inserting character style information as part of an index entry (e.g., when indexing book, journal or movie titles). Indices are limited to four levels (top level and three sub- levels). Like tables of contents, indices can be sorted according to the selected language. * Importing and exporting: Can import QuarkXPress files up to version 4.1 (1999), even using Arabic XT, Arabic Phonyx or Hebrew XPressWay fonts, retaining the layout and content. Includes 50 import/export filters, including a Microsoft Word 97-98-2000 import filter and a plain text import filter. Exports IDML files which can be read by QuarkXPress 2017. * Reverse layout: Include a reverse layout feature to reverse the layout of a document, when converting a left-to-right document to a right-to-left one or vice versa. * Complex script rendering: InDesign supports Unicode character encoding, with Middle East editions supporting complex text layout for Arabic and Hebrew types of complex script. The underlying Arabic and Hebrew support is present in the Western editions of InDesign CS4, CS5, CS5.5 and CS6, but the user interface is not exposed, so it is difficult to access. User groups InDesign has spawned 86 user groups in 36 countries with a total membership of over 51,000.

He was the son of Emperor Isaac II Angelos and his first wife, an unknown Palaiologina, who became a nun with the name Irene. His paternal uncle was his predecessor Emperor Alexios III Angelos. Prince in exile The young Alexios was imprisoned in 1195 when Alexios III overthrew Isaac II in a coup. In 1201, two Pisan merchants were employed to smuggle Alexios out of Constantinople to the Holy Roman Empire, where he took refuge with his brother-in-law Philip of Swabia,Philip was married to Irene Angelina a sister of Alexios IV. King of Germany. According to the contemporary account of Robert of Clari it was while Alexios was at Swabia's court that he met with Marquis Boniface of Montferrat, Philip's cousin, who had been chosen to lead the Fourth Crusade, but had temporarily left the Crusade during the siege of Zara in 1202 to visit Philip. Boniface and Alexios allegedly discussed diverting the Crusade to Constantinople so that Alexios could be restored to his father's throne. Montferrat returned to the Crusade while it wintered at Zara and he was shortly followed by Prince Alexios's envoys who offered to the Crusaders 10,000 Byzantine soldiers to help fight in the Crusade, maintain 500 knights in the Holy Land, the service of the Byzantine navy (20 ships) in transporting the Crusader army to Egypt, as well as money to pay off the Crusaders' debt to the Republic of Venice with 200,000 silver marks. Additionally, he promised to bring the Greek Orthodox Church under the authority of the pope. The Venetians and most of the Leaders were in favour of the plan; however, some were not, and there were defections, including Simon of Montfort. In 1202 the fleet arrived at Constantinople. Alexios was paraded outside the walls, but the citizens were apathetic, as Alexios III, though a usurper and illegitimate in the eyes of the westerners, was an acceptable emperor for the Byzantine citizens. Emperor Alexios comes to Zara to request the assistance of the Crusaders; sketch from a painting in the Doge's Palace, Venice On 18 July 1203 the Crusaders launched an assault on the city, and Alexios III immediately fled into Thrace. The next morning the Crusaders were surprised to find that the citizens had released Isaac II from prison and proclaimed him emperor, despite the fact that he had been blinded to make him ineligible to rule. The Crusaders could not accept this, and forced Isaac II to proclaim his son Alexios IV co-emperor on 1 August. Despite Alexios' grand promises, Isaac, the more experienced and practical of the two, knew that the Crusaders' debt could never be repaid from the imperial treasury. Alexios, however, had apparently not grasped how far the empire's financial resources had fallen during the previous fifty years. Alexios did manage to raise half the sum promised (100,000 silver marks), by appropriating treasures from the church and by confiscating the property of his enemies. He then attempted to defeat his uncle Alexios III, who remained in control of Thrace. The sack of some Thracian towns helped Alexios' situation a little, but meanwhile hostility between the restive Crusaders and the inhabitants of Constantinople was growing. In December 1203 violence exploded between the citizens of Constantinople and the Crusaders. Enraged mobs seized and brutally murdered any foreigner they could lay hands upon, and the Crusaders felt that Alexios had not fulfilled his promises to them. Alexios refused their demands, and is quoted as saying, \\"I will not do any more than I have done.\\" While relations with the Crusaders were deteriorating, Alexios had become deeply unpopular with the Greek citizenry, and with his own father. Blinded and nearly powerless, Isaac II resented having to share the throne with his son; he spread rumours of Alexios' supposed sexual perversity, alleging he kept company with \\"depraved men\\". The chronicler Nicetas Choniates dismissed Alexios as \\"childish\\" and criticized his familiarity with the Crusaders and his lavish lifestyle. At the beginning of January 1204, Alexios IV retaliated against the Crusaders by setting fire to 17 ships filled with inflammable materials and sending them against the Venetian fleet, but the attempt failed. Deposition and death At the end of January 1204, the populace of Constantinople rebelled and tried to proclaim a rival emperor Nicholas Canabus who took sanctuary in the bowels of the Hagia Sophia. Alexios IV attempted to reach a reconciliation with the Crusaders, entrusting the anti-western courtier Alexios Doukas Murzuphlus with a mission to gain Crusader support. However, Alexios Doukas imprisoned both Alexios IV and his father on the night of 27‚Äì28 January 1204. Isaac II died soon afterwards, possibly of old age or from poison, and Alexios IV was strangled on 8 February. Alexios Doukas was proclaimed emperor as Alexios V. During Alexios IV's brief reign, the empire's territories along the Black Sea coast declared independence, leading to the Byzantine successor state known as the Empire of Trebizond. The volatile situation in Constantinople at the time ensured that the empire had neither the resources nor wherewithal to maintain control of Trebizond, resulting in a de facto recognition of its Independence, although de jure it remained an Imperial possession. In popular culture Alexios IV is mentioned in the \\"Map of the Seven Knights\\" episode of the 5th season of the Grimm TV series. He is mentioned as a pro-Crusader.

Hutchinson says salsa music and dance \\"both originated with Cuban rhythms that were brought to New York and adopted, adapted, reformulated, and made new by Dominican Johnny Pacheco and many Puerto Ricans living there. In fact, most Salsa musicians from the era were and are of Puerican descent. \\"Catapano 2011 Salsa is an amalgamation of Puertorican, Dominican and Cuban dances that were popular in the ballrooms and nightclubs of San Juan and la Havana by the end of the 1950s (e.g. \\"casino\\", mambo and pachanga), as well as American jazz dances. It was primarily developed by Dominicans and Puerto Ricans living in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own, such as Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Cali Colombia, L.A. and New York styles. Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs, bars, ballrooms, restaurants, and outside, especially when part of an outdoor festival. In many styles of salsa dancing, as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping into the middle to have 50/50 weight, the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes. the movement rotates in a figure of eight to cause the hips to move. Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated. Salsa's tempo ranges from about 150 bpm (beats per minute) to around 250 bpm, although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160‚Äì220 bpm. The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music. The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes eight beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps. Origin Students from Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City perform at Culture Week Johnny Pacheco founded Fania record label in the 1960s and gave the name \\"Salsa\\" to a blend of different influences, rhythms and styles of Latin music in New York City, especially in el Barrio, Spanish Harlem, and the Bronx. Salsa means sauce which represented son, guaguanco, son montuno, Jazz elements, Latin Jazz, Cuban influences. Prior to that time, each style was recognized in its pure original form and name. It evolved from forms such as Son, Son Montuno, cha cha cha, and Mambo which were popular in the Caribbean, Latin America and the Latino communities in New York since the 1940s. Salsa, like most music genres and dance styles, has diversified through the years and incorporated elements of other Afro-Caribbean dances such as Pachanga created by johnny pacheco as well. Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own, such as Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Cali Colombia. There is some controversy surrounding the origins of the word \\"salsa,\\" which has been ascribed to the dance since the mid-1800s. Some claim that it was based on a cry shouted by musicians while they were playing their music. Others believe that the term was created by record labels to better market their music, who chose the word \\"salsa\\" because of its spicy and hot connotations. Still, others believe the term came about because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles, just like salsa or \\"sauce\\" in Latin American countries is a mixture of different ingredients. Description In many styles of salsa dancing, as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping, the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes. Weight shifts cause the hips to move. Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated. The Cuban Casino style of salsa dancing involves significant movement above the waist, with up-and-down shoulder movements and shifting of the ribcage. The arms are used by the \\"lead\\" dancer to communicate or signal the \\"follower,\\" either in \\"open\\" or \\"closed\\" position. The open position requires the two dancers to hold one or both hands, especially for moves that involve turns, putting arms behind the back, or moving around each other, to name a few examples. In the closed position, the leader puts the right hand on the follower's back, while the follower puts the left hand on the leader's shoulder. In the original Latin American form, the forward/backward motion of salsa is done in diagonal or sideways with the 3-step weight change intact. In some styles of salsa, such as the New York style, the dancers remain mostly in front of one another (switching places), while in Latin American styles, such as Cuban style, the dancers circle around each other, sometimes in 3 points. This circular style is inspired by Cuban Son, specifically to the beat of son montuno in the 1920s. However, as it is a popular music, it is open to improvisation and thus it is continuously evolving. Modern salsa styles are associated and named to the original geographic areas that developed them. There are often devotees of each of these styles outside their home territory. Characteristics that may identify a style include: timing, basic steps, foot patterns, body movement, turns and figures, attitude, dance influences and the way that partners hold each other. The point in a musical bar music where a slightly larger step is taken (the break step) and the direction the step moves can often be used to identify a style. Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing has become very common for both men and women: shimmies, leg work, arm work, body movement, spins, body isolations, shoulder shimmies, rolls, even hand styling, acrobatics and lifts. Latin American styles originate from Puerto Rico, Cuba and surrounding Caribbean islands. Venues Salsa dance socials are commonly held in night clubs, bars, ballrooms, restaurants, and outside, especially if part of an outdoor festival. Salsa dancing is an international dance that can be found in most metropolitan cities in the world. Festivals are held annually, often called a Salsa Congress, in various host cities aimed to attract variety of salsa dancers from other cities and countries. The events bring dancers together to share their passion for the dance, build community, and to share moves and tips with each other. These events usually include salsa dance performers, live salsa music, workshops, open dancing, and contests. Rhythm Dancing Salsa in Mexico Salsa generally uses music suitable for dancing ranges from about 150 bpm (beats per minute) to around 250 bpm, although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160‚Äì220 bpm. Every salsa composition involves complex Afro-Cuban percussion based around the Clave Rhythm (which has four types), though there can be moments when the clave is hidden for a while, often when quoting Charanga, Chang√º√≠ and Bomba. The key instrument that provides the core groove of a salsa song is the clave. It is often played with two wooden sticks (called clave) that are hit together. Every instrument in a salsa band is either playing with the clave (generally: congas, timbales, piano, tres guitar, bongos, claves (instrument), strings) or playing independent of the clave rhythm (generally: bass, maracas, g√ºiro, cowbell). Melodic components of the music and dancers can choose to be in clave or out of clave at any point. However it is taboo to play or dance to the wrong type of clave rhythm (see salsa music). While dancers can mark the clave rhythm directly, it is more common to do so indirectly (with, for example, a shoulder movement). This allows the dancing itself to look very fluent as if the rest of the body is just moving untouched with the legs. For salsa, there are four types of clave rhythms, the 3-2 and 2-3 Son claves being the most important, and the 3-2 and 2-3 Rumba claves. Most salsa music is played with one of the son claves, though a rumba clave is occasionally used, especially during rumba sections of some songs. As an example of how a clave fits within the 8 beats of a salsa dance, the beats of the 2-3 Son clave are played on the counts of 2, 3, 5, the \\"and\\" of 6, and 8. There are other aspects outside the Clave that help define salsa rhythm: the cowbell, the Montuno rhythm and the Tumbao rhythm. The cowbell rhythm emphasizes the \\"on- beats\\" of salsa: 1, 3, 5 and 7 while the conga rhythm emphasizes the \\"off- beats\\" of the music: 2, 4, 6, and 8. Some dancers like to use the strong sound of the cowbell to stay on the Salsa rhythm. Alternatively, others use the conga rhythm to create a jazzier feel to their dance since strong \\"off-beats\\" are a jazz element. Tumbao is the name of the rhythm that is played with the conga drums. It sounds like: \\"cu, cum.. pa... cu, cum... pa\\". Its most basic pattern is played on the beats 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8. Tumbao rhythm is helpful for learning to dance contra-tiempo (\\"On2\\"). The beats 2 and 6 are emphasized when dancing On2, and the Tumbao rhythm heavily emphasizes those beats as well. The Montuno rhythm is a rhythm that is often played with a piano. The Montuno rhythm loops over the 8 counts and is useful for finding the direction of the music. By listening to the same rhythm, that loops back to the beginning after eight counts, one can recognize which count is the first beat of the music. The basic salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music. The odd number of steps creates the inherent syncopation to the Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps. Different styles employ this syncopation differently. For \\"On1\\" dancers this rhythm is described as \\"quick, quick, quick, pause, quick, quick, quick, pause\\". For \\"On2\\" dancers this rhythm is \\"quick, quick, slow, quick, quick, slow\\". In all cases, only three steps are taken in each 4-beat measure (or 6 total over 8 beats). Styles International Salsa Congress, 2004 at Bangalore Video demonstrating salsa dancing fundamentals Salsa's roots are based on different Cuban genres such as Cuban Son, specifically to the beat of Son Montuno in the 1920s. However, as it is a popular music, it is open to improvisation and thus it is continuously evolving. New modern salsa styles are associated and named to the original geographic areas that developed them. There are often devotees of each of these styles outside their home territory. Characteristics that may identify a style include: timing, basic steps, foot patterns, body rolls and movements, turns and figures, attitude, dance influences and the way that partners hold each other. The point in a musical bar music where a slightly larger step is taken (the break step) and the direction the step moves can often be used to identify a style. =Afro-Latino style= The afro-Latino style is a very popular kind of salsa in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. It pretty much involves the same dancing as most versions of the salsa but has a little bit of twist added to it. The thing that separates it and gives it its own identity is that some of the songs tie in an African language and certain African instruments that gives the songs different rhythms. Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing has become very common, for both men and women: shimmies, leg work, arm work, body movement, spins, body isolations, shoulder shimmies, rolls, even hand styling, acrobatics and lifts. Latin American styles originate from Puerto Rico, Cuba and surrounding Caribbean islands including the Dominican Republic, and then expanding to Venezuela, Colombia, and the rest of Latin America; Also, there exists the \\"Miami\\" style, which is a fusion of some Cuban style elements with elements of various North American dances from the USA. =Colombian / Cali style= Cali-Style Salsa, also known as Colombian Salsa and Salsa Cale√±a, is based on geographical location of the Colombian City of Cali. Cali is also known as the \\"Capital de la Salsa\\" (Salsa's Capital); due to salsa music being the main genre in parties, nightclubs and festivals in the 21st century. The elements of Cali-Style Salsa were strongly influenced by dances to Caribbean rhythms which preceded salsa, such as Pachanga and Boogaloo. Cali has the most salsa schools and salsa teams in the world. Many of the competitions are held in Colombia. The central feature is the footwork which has quick rapid steps and skipping motions. Colombian style does not execute Cross-body Leads or the \\"Dile Que No\\" as seen in other styles, but rather step in place and displace in closed position. Their footwork is intricate and precise, helping several Colombian Style dancers win major world championships. Cali hosts many annual salsa events such as the World Salsa Cali Festival and the Encuentro de Melomanos y Coleccionistas. =Cuban style / Casino= In Cuba, a popular dance known as Casino was marketed as Cuban-style salsa or Salsa Cubana abroad to distinguish it from other salsa styles when the name was popularized in the 1970s. Casino is popular in many places around the world, including in Europe, Latin America, North America, and even in some countries in the Middle East such as Israel. Dancing Casino is an expression of popular social culture; Cubans consider casino as part of social and cultural activities centering on their popular music. The name Casino is derived from the Spanish term for the dance halls, \\"Casinos Deportivos\\" where much social dancing was done among the better-off, white Cubans during the mid-20th century and onward. Historically, Casino traces its origin as a partner dance from Cuban Son, Cha Cha Cha, Danz√≥n and Guaracha. Traditionally, Casino is danced \\"a contratiempo\\". This means that, distinct from subsequent forms of salsa, no step is taken on the first and fifth beats in each clave pattern and the fourth and eighth beat are emphasised. In this way, rather than following a beat, the dancers themselves contribute in their movement, to the polyrythmic pattern of the music. At the same time, it is often danced \\"a tiempo\\", although both \\"on3\\" (originally) and \\"on1\\" (nowadays). What gives the dance its life, however, is not its mechanical technique, but understanding and spontaneous use of the rich Afro- Cuban dance vocabulary within a \\"Casino\\" dance. In the same way that a \\"sonero\\" (lead singer in Son and salsa bands) will \\"quote\\" other, older songs in their own, a \\"casino\\" dancer will frequently improvise references to other dances, integrating movements, gestures and extended passages from the folkloric and popular heritage. This is particularly true of African descended Cubans. Such improvisations might include extracts of rumba, dances for African deities, the older popular dances such as Cha Cha Ch√° and Danzon as well as anything the dancer may feel. Miami-style Casino Developed by Cuban immigrants to Florida and centered on Miami, this dance style is a fusion of some elements from Casino with many elements from American culture and dances. The major difference of Miami-style from other North American styles is the \\"Atras\\" or \\"Diagonal\\", back breaking steps performed backwards diagonally instead of moving forwards and backwards as seen in the New York style. Dancers do not shift their body weight greatly as seen in other styles. Instead, dancers keep their upper body still, poised and relaxed while the feet execute endless intricacies. The dancer breaks mostly On1. A major difference between Cali Style and Miami-style is the latter is exclusively danced on the downbeat (On1) and has elements of shines and show-style added to it, following repertoires of North American styles. Miami-style has many adherents, particularly Cuban-Americans and other Latinos based in South Florida. Rueda de Casino In the 1950s Salsa Rueda or more accurately Rueda de Casino was developed in Havana, Cuba. Pairs of dancers form a circle (\\"Rueda\\" in Spanish means \\"Wheel\\"), with dance moves called out by one person. Many of the moves involve rapidly swapping partners. \\"Rueda de Cuba\\" is original type of Rueda, originating from Cuba. It is not as formal as Rueda de Miami and consists of about 30 calls. It was codified in the 1970s. \\"Rueda de Miami\\" originated in the 1980s from Miami, is a formal style with many rules based on a mix, and is a hybridization of Rueda de Cuba & North American dance styles, with some routines reflecting American culture (e.g. Coca-Cola, Dedo, Adios) which is not found in the traditional Cuban-style Rueda. =Los Angeles style= Basic step for LA style, with leader's steps in blue Salsa show dancing The Los Angeles Salsa Style (LA style) is danced strictly on 1, in a slot \\\\ line, using elements of various North American and stage dances. This helps prevent dancers from hitting other couples on a crowded dance floor. It is strongly influenced by the Latin Hustle, Swing, Argentine Tango, Mambo dancers from Mexico and Latin Ballroom dancing styles. LA style places strong emphasis on sensuousness, theatricality and acrobatics. The lifts, stunts and aerial works of today's salsa shows are derived mostly from LA style forms with origins in Latin Ballroom and Ballet lifts. The two essential elements of this dance are the forward‚Äìbackward basic step and the cross-body lead. In this pattern, the leader steps forward on 1, steps to the right on 2-3 while turning 90 degrees counter-clockwise (facing to the left), leaving the slot open. The follower then steps straight forward on 5-6 and turns on 7-8, while the leader makes another 90 degrees counter-clockwise and slightly forward, coming back into the slot. In total, the couple turned 180¬∞ while the follower moved a distance (about 2meters). Rogelio Moreno, Francisco and Luis Vazquez are credited for the early development and growth of LA Style as well as Albert Torres, Laura Canellias and Joe Cassiniare. Later dancers such as Alex Da Silva, Edie Lewis, Joby Martinez and Johnny Vazquez are often credited with developing the LA style of dancing as we know it today. =New York style= New York style is danced in an ellipse or a \\"flat figure 8\\" on the floor, with the partners facing each other most of the time. Unlike other styles of salsa, New York style is danced on the second beat of the music (\\"on 2\\"), and the follower, not the leader, steps forward on the first measure of the music. The etiquette of New York Style is strict about remaining in the close dance space, and avoiding dancing in a sandbox area with many spins, turns and styling. There is greater emphasis on performing \\"shines\\" in which dancers separate themselves and dance solo with intricate footwork and styling for a time‚Äîa phenomenon that likely has origins from Swing and New York Tap. Though he did not create New York style salsa, Eddie Torres is credited with popularizing it, and for having the follower step forward on the first beat of the first measure, followed by another step forward on the second beat to change direction (the \\"break step\\"). There are two distinct developments of New York salsa as a music and dance genre: #Primary evolution from Mambo era was introduced to New York due to influx of migrating dissidents from all the Caribbean and other Latin migrants during Pre/Post Cuban Revolution in the 1950s and 1960s. This era is known as the \\"Palladium Era\\". At this time, the music and dance was called \\"Mambo\\"‚Äîconnoting the general term without being specific. The most famous dancer during this era was Puerto-Rican descendant Pedro \\"Cuban Pete\\" Aguilar, also known \\"The King of Latin Beat\\". #Secondary evolution during the late 1970s, Latin Puerto Rican migrants, contributed a lot to the New York salsa development during the \\"NuYorican\\" era of H√©ctor Lavoe which greatly popularized salsa and modern Latin music throughout the world. Puerto Rican salsa superstars were the most important musicians during the era, such as Ray Baretto (\\"The Godfather\\") and many others. There are also salsa artists that transcend both periods, notably the legendary Puerto Rican Tito Puente (\\"The Mambo King\\"). These two developments create a fusion of a new salsa music and dance genre, different from its Latin American and Caribbean counterparts. New York style salsa emphasizes harmony with the percussive instruments in salsa music, such as the congas, timbales, and clave, since many or all of those instruments often mark the second beat in the music.

The Great Bible was prepared by Myles Coverdale, working under commission of Thomas, Lord Cromwell, Secretary to Henry VIII and Vicar General. In 1538, Cromwell directed the clergy to provide \\"one book of the Bible of the largest volume in English, and the same set up in some convenient place within the said church that ye have care of, whereas your parishioners may most commodiously resort to the same and read it.\\" The Great Bible includes much from the Tyndale Bible, with the objectionable features revised. As the Tyndale Bible was incomplete, Coverdale translated the remaining books of the Old Testament and Apocrypha from the Latin Vulgate and German translations, rather than working from the original Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Although called the Great Bible because of its large size, it is known by several other names as well: the Cromwell Bible, since Thomas Cromwell directed its publication; Whitchurch's Bible after its first English printer; the Chained Bible, since it was chained to prevent removal from the church. It has less accurately been termed Cranmer's Bible, since although Thomas Cranmer was not responsible for the translation, a preface by him appeared in the second edition.. Sources and history The Tyndale New Testament had been published in 1525, followed by his English version of the Pentateuch in 1530; but both employed vocabulary, and appended notes, that were unacceptable to English churchmen, and to the King. Tyndale's books were banned by royal proclamation in 1530, and Henry then held out the promise of an officially authorised English Bible being prepared by learned and catholic scholars. In 1534, Thomas Cranmer sought to advance the King's project by press-ganging ten diocesan bishops to collaborate on an English New Testament, but most delivered their draft portions late, inadequately, or not at all. By 1537 Cranmer was saying that the proposed Bishops' Bible would not be completed until the day after Doomsday. The King was becoming impatient with the slow progress, especially in view of his conviction that the Pilgrimage of Grace had been substantially exacerbated due to the rebels' exploitation of popular religious ignorance. With the bishops showing no signs of completing their task, Cromwell obtained official approval for the Matthew Bible as an interim measure in 1537, the year of its publication under the pseudonym \\"Thomas Matthew\\", actually John Rogers. Cromwell had helped to fund the printing of this version. The Matthew Bible combined the New Testament of William Tyndale, and as much of the Old Testament as Tyndale had been able to translate before being put to death the prior year for \\"heresy.\\" Coverdale‚Äôs translation of the Bible from the Latin into English and Matthew‚Äôs translation of the Bible using much of Tyndale's work were each licensed for printing by Henry VIII, but neither was fully accepted by the Church. By 1538, it became compulsory for all churches to own a Bible in accordance with Thomas Cromwell‚Äôs Injunctions. Coverdale based the Great Bible on Tyndale's work, but removed the features objectionable to the bishops. He translated the remaining books of the Old Testament using mostly the Latin Vulgate and German translations. Coverdale's failure to translate from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts gave impetus to the Bishops' Bible. The Great Bible's New Testament revision is chiefly distinguished from Tyndale's source version by the interpolation of numerous phrases and sentences found only in the Vulgate. For example, here is the Great Bible's version of (as given in The New Testament Octapla [The eight English translations of the entire N.T. included (on quarter portions of facing pages) are those of the Bibles in English known as Tyndale's, Great Bible, Geneva Bible, Bishops' Bible, Douay- Rheims (the original Rheims N.T. thereof being included), Great Bible, Authorised \\"King James\\", Revised Version, and Revised Standard Version.]): The non-italicised portions are taken over from Tyndale without change, but the italicised words, which are not found in the Greek text translated by Tyndale, have been added from the Latin. (The added sentence can also be found, with minor verbal differences, in the Douai-Rheims New Testament.) These inclusions appear to have been done to make the Great Bible more palatable to conservative English churchmen, many of whom considered the Vulgate to be the only legitimate Bible. The psalms in the Book of Common Prayer of 1662 continue to be taken from the Great Bible rather than the King James Bible. In 1568, the Great Bible was superseded as the authorised version of the Anglican Church by the Bishops' Bible. The last of over 30 editions of the Great Bible appeared in 1569. Printing Miles Coverdale and Richard Grafton went over to Paris and put the work into the hands of the French printer, Fran√ßois Regnault at the University of Paris, with the countenance of Bonner, then (Bishop Elect of Hereford and) British Ambassador at Paris. There was constant fear of the Inquisition. Coverdale packed off a large quantity of the finished work through Bonner to Cromwell, and just when this was done, the officers of the Inquisition came on the scene. Coverdale and Grafton made their escape. A large quantity of the printed sheets were sold as waste paper to a haberdasher, who resold them to Cromwell's agents, and they were, in due course, sent over to London. Cromwell bought the type and presses from Regnault and secured the services of his compositors. The first edition was a run of 2,500 copies that were begun in Paris in 1539. Much of the printing - in fact 60 percent - was done at Paris, and after some misadventures where the printed sheets were seized by the French authorities on grounds of heresy (since relations between England and France were somewhat troubled at this time), the remaining 40 percent of the publication was completed in London in April 1539. Two luxurious editions were printed to showcase for presentation. One edition was produced for King Henry VIII and the other for Thomas Cromwell. Each was printed on parchment rather than on paper. The woodcut illustrations of these editions, moreover, were then exquisitely painted by hand to look like illuminations. Today, the copy that was owned by King Henry VIII is held by the British Library in London, England. Thomas Cromwell's edition is today held by the Old Library at St John‚Äôs College in Cambridge, England. It went through six subsequent revisions between 1540 and 1541. The second edition of 1540 included a preface by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, recommending the reading of the scriptures. (Cranmer‚Äôs preface was also included in the front of the Bishops' Bible.)

However copies of this work are fairly rare. The most available reprinting of the Great Bible's New Testament (minus its marginal notes) can be found in the second column of the New Testament Octapla edited by Luther Weigle, chairman of the translation committee that produced the Revised Standard Version. Language The language of the Great Bible marks the advent of Early Modern English. Moreover, this variant of English is pre-Elizabethan. The text, which was regularly read in the parish churches, helped to standardise and stabilise the language across England. Some of the readings of the First Authorised Version of the Bible differ from the more familiar 1611 edition, the Third Authorised Version. For example, the commandment against adultery in the Great Bible reads, \\"Thou shalt not breake wedlocke.\\"Exodus 20:1‚Äì17 Illustrations The woodcut illustrations in the earlier editions of the Great Byble in Englyshe evidence a lack of projective geometry in their designs. Though this Bible falls into the Renaissance period of Bible production in the early years of the Protestant Reformation of church theology and religious practice, the artwork used in the Great Byble more closely resembles the charm of the woodcut illustrations found in Biblia Pauperum from the medieval period. The woodcut designs appear in the 1545 edition of Le Premier [-second] volume de la Bible en francoiz nouvellement hystoriee, reveue & corrigee oultre les precedentes impressions published in Paris by Guillaume Le Bret, and now held by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, d√©partement R√©serve des livres rares, A-282. \\" http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb361215968 The style employed by the French woodcutter appears to have been influenced by the Venetian engraver Giovanni Andrea Valvassori, who in 1511 produced the block print picture bible Opera nova contemplativa. http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rosenwald.0028.1 The commonality among the woodcut illustrations is the charm from a lack of sophistication and depth perception associated with the Renaissance and its impact on transforming art. Aftermath The later years of Henry VIII indeed were marked by serious reaction. In 1542 Convocation with the royal consent made an attempt thwarted by Cranmer to Latinise the English version and to make it in reality what the Catholic version of Rheims subsequently became. In the following year Parliament which then practically meant the King and two or three members of the Privy Council restricted the use of the English Bible to certain social classes that excluded nine tenths of the population and three years later it prohibited the use of everything but the Great Bible. It was probably at this time that there took place the great destruction of all previous work on the English Bible which has rendered examples of that work so scarce. Even Tunstall and Heath were anxious to escape from their responsibility in lending their names to the Great Bible. In the midst of this reaction Henry VIII died January 28, 1547.The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia, Volume 2, Edited by James Orr, Chicago: 1915, page 949.

It is considered one of the most important archaeological sites of Maya culture, along with Palenque, Chich√©n, and Calakmul in Mexico, Caracol and Xunantunich in Belize, and Tikal in Guatemala. It is located in the Puuc region of the eastern Yucatan Peninsula, and is considered one of the Maya cities most representative of the region's dominant architectural style. It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in recognition of its significance. It is located 62 km south of M√©rida, capital of Yucat√°n state in Mexico. Its buildings are noted for their size and decoration. Ancient roads called sacbes connect the buildings, and also were built to other cities in the area such as Chich√©n Itz√° in modern-day Mexico, Caracol and Xunantunich in modern-day Belize, and Tikal in modern-day Guatemala. Its buildings are typical of the Puuc style, with smooth low walls that open on ornate friezes based on representations of typical Maya huts. These are represented by columns (representing the reeds used for the walls of the huts) and trapezoidal shapes (representing the thatched roofs). Entwined snakes and, in many cases two-headed snakes are used for masks of the rain god, Chaac; its big noses represent the rays of the storms. Feathered serpents with open fangs are shown leaving from the same human beings. Also seen in some cities are the influences of the Nahua, who followed the cult of Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc. These were integrated with the original elements of the Puuc tradition. The buildings take advantage of the terrain to gain height and acquire important volumes, including the Pyramid of the Magician, with five levels, and the Governor's Palace, which covers an area of more than .  Toponymy  The present name seems to derive from Oxmal, meaning \\"three times built.\\" This seems to refer to the site's antiquity and the times it had to rebuild. The etymology is disputed; another possibility is Uchmal which means \\"what is to come, the future.\\" By tradition, this was supposed to be an \\"invisible city,\\" built in one night by the magic of the dwarf king.  Ancient history  Map of a central portion of Uxmal While much work has been done at the popular tourist destination of Uxmal to consolidate and restore buildings, little in the way of serious archeological excavation and research has been done. The city's dates of occupation are unknown and the estimated population (about 15,000 people) is a rough guess. Most of the city's major construction took place while Uxmal was the capital of a Late Classic Maya state around 850-925 AD. After about 1000 AD, Toltec invaders took over, and most building ceased by 1100 AD. Maya chronicles say that Uxmal was founded about 500 A.D. by Hun Uitzil Chac Tutul Xiu. For generations Uxmal was ruled over by the Xiu family. It was the most powerful site in western Yucat√°n, and for a while, in alliance with Chichen Itza, dominated all of the northern Maya area. Sometime after about 1200, no new major construction seems to have been made at Uxmal, possibly related to the fall of Uxmal's ally Chichen Itza and the shift of power in Yucat√°n to Mayapan. The Xiu moved their capital to Man√≠, and the population of Uxmal declined. Uxmal was dominant from 875 to 900 CE. The site appears to have been the capital of a regional state in the Puuc region from 850-950 CE. The Maya dynasty expanded their dominion over their neighbors. This prominence did not last long, as the population dispersed around 1000 CE. After the Spanish conquest of Yucat√°n (in which the Xiu allied with the Spanish), early colonial documents suggest that Uxmal was still an inhabited place of some importance into the 1550s. As the Spanish did not build a town here, Uxmal was soon after largely abandoned. The Mayan story The Dwarf-Wizard of Uxmal is set in Uxmal.  Description of the site  Governor's Palace Even before the restoration work, Uxmal was in better condition than many other Maya sites. Much was built with well-cut stones set into a core of concrete not relying on plaster to hold the building together. The Maya architecture here is considered matched only by that of Palenque in elegance and beauty. The Puuc style of Maya architecture predominates. Thanks to its good state of preservation, it is one of the few Maya cities where the casual visitor can get a good idea of how the entire ceremonial center looked in ancient times. Some of the more noteworthy buildings include: * The Governor's Palace, a long low building atop a huge platform, with the longest fa√ßades in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. :With an approximate azimuth of 118¬∞, the building is oriented to the main pyramid of Cehtzuc, a small site located nearly 5 km to the southeast. Observing from there, Venus as evening star, when reaching its maximum northerly extremes, would have set behind the northern edge of the Governor's Palace. Since these events occur every eight years, always in late April or early May, heralding the onset of the rainy season, it is significant that the decoration of the building's facade contains almost 400 Venus glyphs placed in the masks of the rain god Chac, and that there are eight bicephalic serpents above the main entrance; additionally, numerals 8 in bar-and-dot notation appear on two Chac masks at the northern corners of the palace.

It was a common practice in Mesoamerica to build new temple pyramids atop older ones, but here a newer pyramid was built centered slightly to the east of the older pyramid, so that on the west side the temple atop the old pyramid is preserved, with the newer temple above it. The structure is featured in one of the best-known tales of Yucatec Maya folklore, \\"el enano del Uxmal\\" (the dwarf of Uxmal), which is also the basis for the structure's common name. Multiple versions of this tale are recorded. It was popularised after one of these was recounted by John Lloyd Stephens in his influential 1841 book, Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan. According to Stephens' version, the pyramid was magically built overnight during a series of challenges issued to a dwarf by the gobernador (ruler or king) of Uxmal. The dwarf's mother (a bruja, or witch) arranged the trial of strength and magic to compete against the king.Stephens (1841, vol. II pp.423‚Äì425) * The Nunnery Quadrangle was built from 900-1000, and the name related with nuns was assigned in the 16th century because it resembled a convent. The quadrangle consists of four palaces placed on different levels that surround a courtyard. Of the different buildings that make up this palatial complex, several vault tops have been recovered, they are painted and represent partial calendrical dates from 906 to 907 AD, which is consistent with the Chan Chahk‚Äôahk Nalajaw period of government. The formal entrance, the hierarchy of the structures through the different elevations, and the absence of domestic elements suggest that this space corresponds to a royal palace with administrative and non-residential functions, where the ruling group must have had meetings to collect the tribute, make decisions, and dictate sentences among other activities. These set of buildings are the finest of Uxmal's several fine quadrangles of long buildings. It has elaborately carved fa√ßades on both the inside and outside faces. * A large Ballcourt for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame. Its inscription says that it was dedicated in 901 by the ruler Chan Chak K'ak'nal Ajaw, also known as Lord Chac (before the decipherment of his corresponding name glyphs). The ball court's condition is very deteriorated, and it‚Äôs made of two constructions of medium dimensions that make up the sides of the court with the rings by which the ball was to be introduced. The originally carved stone rings were removed to protect them from the elements and were replaced by reproductions. This game has always been related to mythical and cosmic aspects. The ball symbolized the movements of the stars in the sky and the players, in repeated occasions, symbolically staged the fight of the day against the night or the struggle of the deities of the underworld against the gods of heaven. Detail of the \\"House of the Turtles\\" A number of other temple-pyramids, quadrangles, and other monuments, some of significant size, and in varying states of preservation, are also at Uxmal. These include North Long Building, House of the Birds, House of the Turtles, Grand Pyramid, House of the Doves, and South Temple. The majority of hieroglyphic inscriptions were on a series of stone stelae unusually grouped together on a single platform. The stelae depict the ancient rulers of the city. They show signs that they were deliberately broken and toppled in antiquity; some were re-erected and repaired. A further suggestion of possible war or battle is found in the remains of a wall which encircled most of the central ceremonial center. A large raised stone pedestrian causeway links Uxmal with the site of Kabah, some 18 km to the south-east. Archaeological research at the small island site of Uaymil, located to the west on the Gulf coast, suggests that it may have served as a port for Uxmal and provided the site access to the circum-peninsular trade network.  Modern history of the ruins  Lights and Sound nightly show on Nunnery Quadrangle. The site, located not far from M√©rida beside a road to Campeche, has attracted many visitors since the time of Mexico's independence. The first detailed account of the ruins was published by Jean Frederic Waldeck in 1838. John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood made two extended visits to Uxmal in the early 1840s, with architect/draftsman Catherwood reportedly making so many plans and drawings that they could be used to construct a duplicate of the ancient city (unfortunately most of the drawings are lost).) D√©sir√© Charnay took a series of photographs of Uxmal in 1860. Some three years later Empress Carlota of Mexico visited Uxmal; in preparation for her visit local authorities had some statues and architectural elements depicting phallic themes removed from the ancient fa√ßades. Sylvanus G. Morley made a map of the site in 1909 which included some previously overlooked buildings. The Mexican government's first project to protect some of the structures from risk of collapse or further decay came in 1927. In 1930 Frans Blom led a Tulane University expedition to the site. They made plaster casts of the fa√ßades of the \\"Nunnery Quadrangle\\"; using these casts, a replica of the Quadrangle was constructed and displayed at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois. The plaster replicas of the architecture were destroyed following the fair, but some of the plaster casts of Uxmal's monuments are still kept at Tulane's Middle American Research Institute. In 1936 a Mexican government repair and consolidation program was begun under Jos√© Erosa Peniche. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited on 27 February 1975 for the inauguration of the site's sound & light show. When the presentation reached the point where the sound system played the Maya prayer to Chaac (the Maya rain deity), a sudden torrential downpour occurred. Gathered dignitaries included Gaspar Antonio Xiu, a descendant of the Xiu noble Maya lineage. Three hotels and a small museum have been built within walking distance of the ancient city.  Microbial degradation  Microbial biofilms have been found degrading stone buildings at Uxmal and Kabah. Phototrophs such as Xenococcus are found more often on interior walls. However stone degrading Gloeocapsa and Synechocystis were also present in large numbers. Aureobasidium and Fusarium fungi species are present at Chichen Itza and Uxmal. Cyanobacteria were prevalent in the interiors of rooms with low light levels.

Early years and education Bill Woodrow was born on 1 November 1948 near Henley-on- Thames, Oxfordshire. He received his education at the Winchester College of Art (1967‚Äì1968), the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (1968‚Äì1971), and the Chelsea School of Art (1971‚Äì1972).. Artistic career Woodrow was one of a number of British sculptors to emerge in the late 1970s on to the international contemporary art scene, together with fellow artists like Richard Deacon and Tony Cragg. Materials found in dumps, used car lots and scrap yards formed the raw materials for his early works; by partly embedding them in plaster, he made them seem as if they had been excavated. Subsequently, he turned to large consumer goods like cars and refrigerators. While their original structures could still be discerned, he cut portions out of them and reattached the portions to the main structures so that they appeared to be connected through umbilical cords. He held his first solo exhibition at Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in 1972. Woodrow's works often featured a narrative element, and in the 1990s when he began to make work in bronze, stories remained an important element of his sculptures. A seminal work was In Awe of the Pawnbroker (1994), in which the meaning of the pawnbroker's symbol was unravelled. This sculpture has a number of elements that add up to what is virtually an installation. One of three artists selected to make a sculpture for the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square, London, in 2000, Woodrow chose to explore a recurring theme in his work ‚Äì the destruction of the planet and the insistent strength of nature over man ‚Äì in the piece entitled Regardless of History. Major exhibitions Bunker/Mule (1995) in Bl√•vand-Oksby, Denmark Important solo shows by Woodrow include the XXI S√£o Paulo Art Biennial (Brazil, 1991); Fool's Gold, an exhibition of bronze sculptures at the Tate Modern (London, UK, 1996); and Bee Keeper at the South London Gallery (2001). Several exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts in London have featured his works, including Earth: Art of a Changing World (2009) and Modern British Sculpture (2011). Between 30 March and 29 September 2013, Woodrow curated the exhibition Here, There and Somewhere in Between at Hatfield House in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. A joint project between the historic country house and the Royal Academy, the show included Woodrow's piece Endeavour: Cannon Dredged from the First Wreck of the Ship of Fools as well as works by Michael Craig-Martin, Richard Deacon and Gary Hume. A major retrospective of his work was held at the Royal Academy between 7 November 2013 and 16 February 2014. Awards and honours Woodrow was a finalist for the Turner Prize in 1986, and was elected a Royal Academician in the sculpture category in May 2002..

Van Flandern had a career as a professional scientist, but was noted as an outspoken proponent of certain fringe views in astronomy, physics, and extra-terrestrial life. He also published the non-mainstream Meta Research Bulletin.  Biography  Van Flandern mentioned in historical marker about Project Moonwatch. Placed by Cincinnati Astronomical Society and the city of Cincinnati, OH Tom Van Flandern was the first child of Robert F. Van Flandern, a police officer, and Anna Mary Haley. His father left the family when Tom was 5. His mother died when he was 16; he and his siblings then lived with their grandmother, Margery Jobe, until he went to college. He graduated from Saint Ignatius High School in Cleveland. While there, he helped start the Cleveland branch of Operation Moonwatch, an amateur science program initiated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to track satellites.Cleveland Plain Dealer October 8, 1957 \\"Moonwatch Team Here Gets Set\\" page 5The Pharos-Tribune and Logansport Press August 9, 1959 \\"Still Keeping Watch\\" Logansport, IN page 19 He also helped found a Moonwatchers team while studying at Xavier UniversityXavier University News November 5, 1960 Mike Rogers \\"Satellite Spies Situate Tracking Station on Logan\\" page 1; this team broke a tracking record in 1961.Kingsport News May 17, 1961 \\"Reports Activity\\" page 10The Anderson Herald May 17, 1961 \\"Cincy Moonwatchers Report on Satellites\\" page 2 Van Flandern graduated from Xavier University with a B.S. in mathematics (cum laude) in 1962 and was awarded a teaching fellowship at Georgetown University.Xavier University News May 4, 1962 \\"Tom Van Flandern Given Fellowship\\" page 9 He attended Yale University on a scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO), joining USNO in 1963. In 1969, he received a Ph.D. in astronomy from Yale after completing his dissertation on lunar occultations. Van Flandern worked at the USNO until 1983, first becoming Chief of the Research BranchUSNO Staff Directory for Nautical Almanac Office, December 1976 and later becoming Chief of the Celestial Mechanics Branch of the Nautical Almanac Office.USNO Staff Directory for Nautical Almanac Office, November 1977 His espousal of highly non-mainstream beliefs, particularly the exploded planet hypothesis, eventually led to his separation from the USNO. He later said, \\"This forced me to the 'fringes,' areas of astronomy not accepted as credible by experts of the field\\".Gonzo Science, Jim Richardson, Alan Richardson, p. 62, 2004. Following his separation from the USNO, Van Flandern started a business organizing eclipse viewing expeditions, and promoting his non-mainstream views in a newsletter and web site. Shortly after his death in 2009, the asteroid 52266 Van Flandern was named in his honor because of his prediction and analysis of lunar occultations at the U.S. Naval Observatory and publications of papers on the dynamics of binary minor planets. He married Barbara Ann Weber (1942-2018) in 1963 in Kentucky, and they had 3 sons, Michael, Brian, and Kevin, and a daughter, Connie. The couple moved to Sequim, Washington from the East Coast in 2005 to be closer to their children and grandchildren.Barbara Ann (Weber) Flandern, Peninsula Daily News, Legacy.Com Tom Van Flandern died of colon cancer in Seattle, Washington.  Mainstream scientific work  During the mid-1970s, Van Flandern believed that lunar observations gave evidence of variation in Newton's gravitational constant (G), consistent with a speculative idea that had been put forward by Paul Dirac. In 1974, his essay \\"A Determination of the Rate of Change of G\\" was awarded second place by the Gravity Research Foundation. However, in later years, with new data available, Van Flandern himself admitted his findings were flawed, and the conclusions were contradicted by more accurate findings based on radio measurements with the Viking landers.Dark Matter, Missing Planets, New Comets, Van Flandern 1993. Van Flandern and Henry Fliegel developed a compact algorithm to calculate a Julian date from a Gregorian date that would fit on a single IBM card. They described this in a letter to the editor of a computing magazine in 1968. This was available for use in business applications. With Kenneth Pulkkinen, he published \\"Low precision formulae for planetary positions\\", in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement in 1979. The paper set a record for the number of reprints requested from that journal.  Non-mainstream science and beliefs  Van Flandern described in his book\\"Dark Matter, Missing Planets, New Comets\\", Van Flandern (1993) how he had become increasingly dissatisfied with the mainstream view of science by the early 1980s. He wrote ::Events in my life caused me to start questioning my goals and the correctness of everything I had learned. In matters of religion, medicine, biology, physics, and other fields, I came to discover that reality differed seriously from what I had been taught. In his book, on blogs, lectures, newsletter and web site, Van Flandern focused on problems in cosmology and physics. He alleged that when experimental evidence is incompatible with mainstream scientific theories, mainstream scientists refuse to acknowledge this to avoid jeopardizing their funding. = Minor-planet satellites = Following claims by David Dunham in 1978 to have detected satellites for some asteroids (notably 532 Herculina) by examining the light patterns during stellar occultations, Van Flandern and others began to report similar observations.Van Flandern, T. C., Tedesco, E. F. & Binzel, R. P. in Asteroids (ed. Gehrels, T.) 443‚Äì465 (Univ. Ariz. Press, Tucson, 1979). = Exploding Planets = In 1976, while Van Flandern was employed by the USNO, he began to promote the belief that major planets sometimes explode. According to Van Flandern's article on the Exploded Planet Hypothesis \\"The third planetary explosion mechanism relies on one other hypothesis not yet widely accepted, but holds out the potential for an indefinitely large reservoir of energy for exploding even massive planets and stars. If gravitational fields are continually regenerated, as in LeSage particle models of gravity [xvi], then all masses are continually absorbing energy from this universal flux.\\" Van Flandern also speculated that the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded \\"Planet V\\". = Le Sage's theory of gravitation and the speed of gravity = Van Flandern supported Georges-Louis Le Sage's theory of gravitation, according to which gravity is the result of a flux of invisible \\"ultra-mundane corpuscles\\" impinging on all objects from all directions at superluminal speeds. He gave public lectures in which he claimed that these particles could be used as a limitless source of free energy, and to provide superluminal propulsion for spacecraft. An editor gave a summary of Van Flandern's talk at the Infinite Energy conference and wrote \\"Van Flandern gave a talk entitled 'On a Complete Theory of Gravity and Free Energy'. For the free energy enthusiast, the implications of gravity being particulate and perhaps blockable are obvious. Block or deflect the c-gravitons raining down from the sky and up you go into space. Turn off the blocking shield and recover the energy you've gained, for free, as you fall back to Earth.\\" In 1998 Van Flandern wrote a paper asserting that astronomical observations imply that gravity propagates at least twenty billion times faster than light, or even infinitely fast. Gerald E. Marsh, Charles Nissim-Sabat and Steve Carlip demonstrated that Van Flandern's argument was fallacious. = Face on Mars = Van Flandern was a prominent advocate of the belief that certain geological features seen on Mars, especially the \\"face at Cydonia\\", are not of natural origin, but were produced by intelligent extra-terrestrial life, probably the inhabitants of a major planet once located where the asteroid belt presently exists, and which Van Flandern believed had exploded 3.2 million years ago. The claimed artificiality of the \\"face\\" was also the topic of a chapter of his 1993 book. The \\"Face\\" is an optical illusion, an example of pareidolia, and theories that it was an artificial artifact were derided by skeptics and science educators as pseudoscience. After analysis of the higher resolution Mars Global Surveyor data NASA stated that \\"a detailed analysis of multiple images of this feature reveals a natural looking Martian hill whose illusory face-like appearance depends on the viewing angle and angle of illumination\\". = Rejection of Big Bang Cosmology = Van Flandern was a vocal opponent of the Big Bang model in cosmology, and supported instead a static universe. In 2008 he was an organizer of a conference of individuals who oppose the Big Bang cosmological models.http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20080911/NEWS/809110302  References  * American astronomers Fringe physics 1940 births 2009 deaths ","title":"Tom Van Flandern"},{"id":"176352","text":"Pomacentridae is a family of ray-finned fish, comprising the damselfishes and clownfishes. This family were formerly placed in the order Perciformes but are now regarded as being incertae sedis in the subseries Ovalentaria in the clade Percomorpha. They are primarily marine, while a few species inhabit freshwater and brackish environments (e.g., Neopomacentrus aquadulcis, N. taeniurus, Pomacentrus taeniometopon, Stegastes otophorus). They are noted for their hardy constitutions and territoriality. Many are brightly colored, so they are popular in aquaria. Around 385 species are classified in this family, in about 29 genera. Of these, members of two genera, Amphiprion and Premnas (subfamily Amphiprioninae), are commonly called clownfish or anemonefish, while members of other genera (e.g., Pomacentrus) are commonly called damselfish. The members of this family are classified in four subfamilies: Amphiprioninae, Chrominae, Lepidozyginae, and Pomacentrinae. Etymology The name of the family is derived from the Greek words; poma roughly translates to the English \\"cover\\", referring to the fishes' opercula, and kentron is Greek for sting. The name refers to the serrations found along the margins of the opercular bones in many members of this family. Distribution and habitat Pomacentrids are found primarily in tropical seas, with a few species occurring in temperate waters (e.g., Hypsypops rubicundus). Most species are found on or near coral reefs in the Indo-West Pacific (from East Africa to Polynesia). The area from the Philippines to Australia hosts the greatest concentration of species. The remaining species are found in the Atlantic or eastern Pacific. Some species are native to freshwater or brackish estuarine environments. Most members of the family live in shallow water, from in depth, although some species (e.g., Chromis abyssus) are found below . Most species are specialists, living in specific parts of the reef, such as sandy lagoons, steep reef slopes, or areas exposed to strong wave action. In general, the coral is used as shelter, and many species can only survive in its presence. The bottom-dwelling species are territorial, occupying and defending a portion of the reef, often centered on shelter. By keeping away other species of fish, some pomacentrids encourage the growth of thick mats of algae within their territories, leading to the common name farmerfish. Characteristics Indo- Pacific sergeant or damselfish in Sea of Dibba, Fujairah, UAE Pomacentrids have an orbiculate to elongated body shape, which is often laterally compressed. They have interrupted or incomplete lateral lines and they usually have a single nostril on each side (some species of Chromis and Dascyllus have two on each side). They have small- to medium-sized ctenoid scales. They have one or two rows of teeth, which may be conical or spatulate. They display a wide range of colors, predominantly bright shades of yellow, red, orange, and blue, although some are a relatively drab brown, black, or grey. The young are often a different, brighter color than adults. Pomacentrids are omnivorous or herbivorous, feeding on algae, plankton, and small bottom-dwelling crustaceans, depending on their precise habitats. Only a small number of genera, such as Cheiloprion, eat the coral where they live. They also engage in symbiotic relationship with cleaner gobies of genus Elacatinus, allowing the gobies to feed on ectoparasites on their bodies. Lifecycle Before breeding, the males clear an area of algae and invertebrates to create a nest. They engage in ritualised courtship displays, which may consist of rapid bursts of motion, chasing or nipping females, stationary hovering, or wide extension of their fins. After being attracted to the site, the female lays a string of sticky eggs that attach to the substrate. The male swims behind the female as she lays the eggs, and fertilises them externally. Varying by species, brood sizes range from 50 to 1000 eggs. The male guards the nest for the two to seven days needed for the eggs to hatch. The transparent larvae are long. They go through a pelagic stage, which depending on the species, can last as little as a week or more than a month. When they arrive at a suitable environment, the young settle and adopt their juvenile colors. In captivity, pomacentrids live up to 18 years, but they probably do not live longer than 10 to 12 years in the wild. Genera About 28 genera in four subfamilies are recognized: * Subfamily Amphiprioninae (anemonefishes) ** Amphiprion (anemonefishes) ** Premnas (if recognized as distinct from Amphiprion) * Subfamily Chrominae ** Acanthochromis ** Altrichthys ** Chromis (chromis) ** Azurina ** Dascyllus (dascyllus) * Subfamily Lepidozyginae ** Lepidozygus (fusilier damselfish) * Subfamily Pomacentrinae * Abudefduf (sergeant majors) * Amblyglyphidodon * Amblypomacentrus * Cheiloprion * Chrysiptera (demoiselles) * Dischistodus * Hemiglyphidodon * Hypsypops (garibaldi) * Mecaenichthys * Microspathodon * Neoglyphidodon * Neopomacentrus (demoiselles) * Nexilosus * Parma (scalyfins) * Plectroglyphidodon * Pomacentrus * Pomachromis (reef-damsels) * Pristotis * Similiparma * Stegastes (=Eupomacentrus) (gregories) * Teixeirichthys *Palaeopomacentrus, extinct Image:Abudefduf sexfasciatus R√©union.jpgAbudefduf sexfasciatus Image:Acanthochromis polyacanthus.jpgAcanthochromis polyacanthus Image:Amblyglyphidodon curacao.jpgAmblyglyphidodon curacao Image:Green.chromis.arp.jpgChromis viridis Image:Crysiptera_hemicyanea.jpgChrysiptera hemicyanea Image:Dascyllus trimaculatus R√©union.jpgDascyllus trimaculatus Image:Hypsypops_rubicundus_adult.jpgHypsypops rubicundus Image:Yellowtail damselfish Microspathodon chrysurus (4657125482).jpgMicrospathodon chrysurus Image:Neoglyphidodon melas.jpgNeoglyphidodon melas Image:Parma_kermadecensis_%28Kermadec_scalyfin%29.jpgParma kermadecensis Image:Plectroglyphidodon johnstonianus R√©union.JPGPlectroglyphidodon johnstonianus Image:Pomacentrus caeruleopunctatus R√©union.jpgPomacentrus caeruleus Image:Maroon Clown Fish444.jpgPremnas biaculeatus Image:Stegastes nigricans.JPGStegastes nigricans =Timeline= ImageSize = width:1000px height:auto barincrement:15px PlotArea = left:10px bottom:50px top:10px right:10px Period = from:-65.5 till:10 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:-65.5 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:-65.5 TimeAxis = orientation:hor AlignBars = justify Colors = #legends id:CAR value:claret id:ANK value:rgb(0.4,0.3,0.196) id:HER value:teal id:HAD value:green id:OMN value:blue id:black value:black id:white value:white id:cenozoic value:rgb(0.54,0.54,0.258) id:paleogene value:rgb(0.99,0.6,0.32) id:paleocene value:rgb(0.99,0.65,0.37) id:eocene value:rgb(0.99,0.71,0.42) id:oligocene value:rgb(0.99,0.75,0.48) id:neogene value:rgb(0.999999,0.9,0.1) id:miocene value:rgb(0.999999,0.999999,0) id:pliocene value:rgb(0.97,0.98,0.68) id:quaternary value:rgb(0.98,0.98,0.5) id:pleistocene value:rgb(0.999999,0.95,0.68) id:holocene value:rgb(0.999,0.95,0.88) BarData= bar:eratop bar:space bar:periodtop bar:space bar:NAM1 bar:space bar:period bar:space bar:era PlotData= align:center textcolor:black fontsize:M mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(7,-4) bar:periodtop from: -65.5 till: -55.8 color:paleocene text:Paleocene from: -55.8 till: -33.9 color:eocene text:Eocene from: -33.9 till: -23.03 color:oligocene text:Oligocene from: -23.03 till: -5.332 color:miocene text:Miocene from: -5.332 till: -2.588 color:pliocene text:Plio. from: -2.588 till: -0.0117 color:pleistocene text:Pleist. from: -0.0117 till: 0 color:holocene text:H. bar:eratop from: -65.5 till: -23.03 color:paleogene text:Paleogene from: -23.03 till: -2.588 color:neogene text:Neogene from: -2.588 till: 0 color:quaternary text:Q.

The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus's orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton. Le Verrier sent the coordinates to Johann Gottfried Galle in Berlin, asking him to verify. Galle found Neptune in the same night he received Le Verrier's letter, within 1¬∞ of the predicted position. The discovery of Neptune is widely regarded as a dramatic validation of celestial mechanics, and is one of the most remarkable moments of 19th-century science. Biography Statue of Le Verrier at the Paris Observatory =Early years= Le Verrier was born at Saint-L√¥, Manche, France, in a modest bourgeois family, being his parents, Louis-Baptiste Le Verrier and Marie-Jeanne-Josephine-Pauline de Baudre, and studied at √âcole Polytechnique. He briefly studied chemistry under Gay-Lussac, writing papers on the combinations of phosphorus and hydrogen, and phosphorus and oxygen. He then switched to astronomy, particularly celestial mechanics, and accepted a job at the Paris Observatory. He spent most of his professional life there, and eventually became that institution's Director, from 1854 to 1870 and again from 1873 to 1877. In 1846, Le Verrier became a member of the French Academy of Sciences, and in 1855, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Le Verrier's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. =Career= Early work Le Verrier's first work in astronomy was presented to the Acad√©mie des Sciences in September 1839, entitled Sur les variations s√©culaires des orbites des plan√®tes (On the Secular Variations of the Orbits of the Planets). This work addressed the then most-important question in astronomy: the stability of the Solar System, first investigated by Laplace. He was able to derive some important limits on the motions of the system, but due to the inaccurately- known masses of the planets, his results were tentative. From 1844 to 1847, Le Verrier published a series of works on periodic comets, in particular those of Lexell, Faye and DeVico. He was able to show some interesting interactions with the planet Jupiter, proving that certain comets were actually the reappearance of previously-known comets flung into different orbits. Discovery of Neptune Signature of M. LeVerrier Le Verrier's most famous achievement is his prediction of the existence of the then unknown planet Neptune, using only mathematics and astronomical observations of the known planet Uranus. Encouraged by physicist Arago,Arago summary Director of the Paris Observatory, Le Verrier was intensely engaged for months in complex calculations to explain small but systematic discrepancies between Uranus's observed orbit and the one predicted from the laws of gravity of Newton. At the same time, but unknown to Le Verrier, similar calculations were made by John Couch Adams in England. Le Verrier announced his final predicted position for Uranus's unseen perturbing planet publicly to the French Academy on 31 August 1846, two days before Adams's final solution was privately mailed to the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Le Verrier transmitted his own prediction by 18 September in a letter to Johann Galle of the Berlin Observatory. The letter arrived five days later, and the planet was found with the Berlin Fraunhofer refractor that same evening, 23 September 1846, by Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest within 1¬∞ of the predicted location near the boundary between Capricorn and Aquarius. There was, and to an extent still is, controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery. There is no ambiguity to the discovery claims of Le Verrier, Galle, and d'Arrest. Adams's work was begun earlier than Le Verrier's but was finished later and was unrelated to the actual discovery. Not even the briefest account of Adams's predicted orbital elements was published until more than a month after Berlin's visual confirmation. Adams made full public acknowledgement of Le Verrier's priority and credit (not forgetting to mention the role of Galle) when he gave his paper to the Royal Astronomical Society in November 1846:  Tables of the planets  Early in the 19th century, the methods of predicting the motions of the planets were somewhat scattered, having been developed over decades by many different researchers. In 1847, Le Verrier took on the task to \\"... embrace in a single work the entire planetary system, put everything in harmony if possible, otherwise, declare with certainty that there are as yet unknown causes of perturbations...\\", a work which would occupy him for the rest of his life. Le Verrier began by re-evaluating, to the 7th order, the technique of calculating the planetary perturbations known as the perturbing function. This derivation, which resulted in 469 mathematical terms, was complete by 1849. He next collected observations of the positions of the planets as far back as 1750. Examining these and correcting for inconsistencies with the most recent data occupied him until 1852. Le Verrier published, in the Annales de l'Observatoire de Paris, tables of the motions of all of the known planets, releasing them as he completed them, starting in 1858.see, for instance, The tables formed the fundamental ephemeris of the Connaissance des Temps, the astronomical almanac of the Bureau des Longitudes, until about 1912. About that time, Le Verrier's work on the outer planets was revised and expanded by Gaillot.see, for instance, Precession of Mercury The grave of Urbain Le Verrier. Le Verrier began studying the motion of Mercury as early as 1843, with a report entitled D√©termination nouvelle de l ‚Äôorbite de Mercure et de ses perturbations (A New Determination of the Orbit of Mercury and its Perturbations). In 1859, Le Verrier was the first to report that the slow precession of Mercury‚Äôs orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by Newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets. He suggested, among possible explanations, that another planet (or perhaps, instead, a series of smaller 'corpuscules') might exist in an orbit even farther to the Sun than that of Mercury, to account for this perturbation.U. Le Verrier (1859), (in French), \\"Lettre de M. Le Verrier √† M. Faye sur la th√©orie de Mercure et sur le mouvement du p√©rih√©lie de cette plan√®te\\", Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des sciences (Paris), vol. 49 (1859), pp. 379‚Äì383. (At p. 383 in the same volume Le Verrier's report is followed by another, from Faye, enthusiastically recommending to astronomers to search for a previously undetected intra- mercurial object.) (Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun.) The success of the search for Neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to place some faith in this possible explanation, and the hypothetical planet was even named Vulcan. However, no such planet was ever found, and the anomalous precession was eventually explained by general relativity theory. =Later life= Le Verrier's methods of management were disliked by the staff of the Observatoire, and the disputes became so great that he was driven out in 1870. He was succeeded by Delaunay, but was reinstated in 1873 after Delaunay accidentally drowned. Le Verrier held the position until his death in 1877. Le Verrier married Lucille Clotilde Choquet in 1837 and had 3 children. He died in Paris, France and was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery. A large stone celestial globe sits over his grave. He will be remembered by the phrase attributed to Arago: \\"the man who discovered a planet with the point of his pen.\\" Honours * Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society ‚Äì 1868 and 1876 * Namesake of craters on the Moon and Mars, a ring of Neptune, and the asteroid 1997 Leverrier * One of the 72 names engraved on the Eiffel Tower See also * Discovery of Neptune * List of works by Henri Chapu Statue of Le Verrier References Further reading * . . * . * . . * .

He was born in Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, and died in Cambridge. His most famous achievement was predicting the existence and position of Neptune, using only mathematics. The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus's orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton. At the same time, but unknown to each other, the same calculations were made by Urbain Le Verrier. Le Verrier would send his coordinates to Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle, who confirmed the existence of the planet on 23 September 1846, finding it within 1¬∞ of Le Verrier's predicted location (there was, and to some extent still is, some controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery; see Discovery of Neptune). Adams was Lowndean Professor in the University of Cambridge from 1859 until his death. He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866. In 1884, he attended the International Meridian Conference as a delegate for Britain. A crater on the Moon is jointly named after him, Walter Sydney Adams and Charles Hitchcock Adams. Neptune's outermost known ring and the asteroid 1996 Adams are also named after him. The Adams Prize, presented by the University of Cambridge, commemorates his prediction of the position of Neptune. His personal library is held at Cambridge University Library. Early life John Couch Adams Adams was born at Lidcot, a farm at Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, the eldest of seven children. His parents were Thomas Adams (1788‚Äì1859), a poor tenant farmer, and his wife, Tabitha Knill Grylls (1796‚Äì1866). The family were devout Wesleyans who enjoyed music and among John's brothers, Thomas became a missionary, George a farmer, and William Grylls Adams, professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at King's College London. Tabitha was a farmer's daughter but had received a rudimentary education from John Couch, her uncle, whose small library she had inherited. John was intrigued by the astronomy books from an early age. John attended the Laneast village school where he acquired some Greek and algebra. From there, he went, at the age of twelve, to Devonport, where his mother's cousin, the Rev. John Couch Grylls, kept a private school. There he learned classics but was largely self-taught in mathematics, studying in the Library of Devonport Mechanics' Institute and reading Rees's Cyclop√¶dia and Samuel Vince's Fluxions. He observed Halley's comet in 1835 from Landulph and the following year started to make his own astronomical calculations, predictions and observations, engaging in private tutoring to finance his activities. In 1836, his mother inherited a small estate at Badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the University of Cambridge. In October 1839 he entered as a sizar at St John's College, graduating B.A. in 1843 as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizewinner of his year. Discovery of Neptune In 1821, Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus, making predictions of future positions based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation.Bouvard, A. (1821) Tables astronomiques publi√©es par le Bureau des Longitudes de France, Paris, FR: Bachelier Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise some perturbing body.[Anon.] (2001) \\"Bouvard, Alexis\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Deluxe CDROM edition Adams learnt of the irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the \\"perturbation\\" theory. Adams believed, in the face of anything that had been attempted before, that he could use the observed data on Uranus, and utilising nothing more than Newton's law of gravitation, deduce the mass, position and orbit of the perturbing body. On 3 July 1841, he noted his intention to work on the problem. Neptune After his final examinations in 1843, Adams was elected fellow of his college and spent the summer vacation in Cornwall calculating the first of six iterations. While he worked on the problem back in Cambridge, he tutored undergraduates, sending money home to educate his brothers, and even taught his bed maker to read. Apparently, Adams communicated his work to James Challis, director of the Cambridge Observatory, in mid-September 1845, but there is some controversy as to how. On 21 October 1845, Adams, returning from a Cornwall vacation, without appointment, twice called on Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in Greenwich. Failing to find him at home, Adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution, again without the detailed calculations. Airy responded with a letter to Adams asking for some clarification. It appears that Adams did not regard the question as \\"trivial\\", as is often alleged, but he failed to complete a response. Various theories have been discussed as to Adams's failure to reply, such as his general nervousness, procrastination and disorganisation. Meanwhile, Urbain Le Verrier, on 10 November 1845, presented to the Acad√©mie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus, showing that the preexisting theory failed to account for its motion. On reading Le Verrier's memoir, Airy was struck by the coincidence and initiated a desperate race for English priority in discovery of the planet. The search was begun by a laborious method on 29 July. Only after the discovery of Neptune on 23 September 1846 had been announced in Paris did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 August but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet. A keen controversy arose in France and England as to the merits of the two astronomers. As the facts became known, there was wide recognition that the two astronomers had independently solved the problem of Uranus, and each was ascribed equal importance. However, there have been subsequent assertions that \\"The Brits Stole Neptune\\" and that Adams's British contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due. But it is also notable (and not included in some of the foregoing discussion references) that Adams himself publicly acknowledged Le Verrier's priority and credit (not forgetting to mention the role of Galle) in the paper that he gave 'On the Perturbations of Uranus' to the Royal Astronomical Society in November 1846: Adams held no bitterness towards Challis or Airy and acknowledged his own failure to convince the astronomical world: Work style His lay fellowship at St John's College came to an end in 1852, and the existing statutes did not permit his re-election. However, Pembroke College, which possessed greater freedom, elected him in the following year to a lay fellowship which he held for the rest of his life. Despite the fame of his work on Neptune, Adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism. He was particularly adept at fine numerical calculations, often making substantial revisions to the contributions of his predecessors. However, he was \\"extraordinarily uncompetitive, reluctant to publish imperfect work to stimulate debate or claim priority, averse to correspondence about it, and forgetful in practical matters\\". It has been suggested that these are symptoms of Asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the \\"repetitive behaviours and restricted interests\\" necessary to perform the Neptune calculations, in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with Challis and Airy. In 1852, he published new and accurate tables of the Moon's parallax, which superseded Johann Karl Burckhardt's, and supplied corrections to the theories of Marie-Charles Damoiseau, Giovanni Antonio Amedeo Plana, and Philippe Gustave Doulcet. He had hoped that this work would leverage him into the vacant post as superintendent of HM Nautical Almanac Office but John Russell Hind was preferred, Adams lacking the necessary ability as an organiser and administrator. Lunar theory ‚Äî Secular acceleration of the Moon Since ancient times, the Moon's mean rate of motion relative to the stars had been treated as being constant, but in 1695, Edmond Halley had suggested that this mean rate was gradually increasing. Also Philos. Trans. R. Soc. (Abridgements) vol.4 (1694‚Äì1702) pp. 60 at 65: Halley concluded his 1695 article on middle-eastern antiquities by writing: \\"And if any curious traveller ... would please to observe, with due care, the phases of the moon's eclipses at Bagdat, Aleppo and Alexandria, thereby to determine their longitudes, they could not do the science of astronomy a greater service: for in and near these places were made all the observations by which the mean motions of the sun and moon are limited: and I could then pronounce in what proportion the moon's motion does accelerate; which that it does, I think I can demonstrate.\\" But it was left to Richard Dunthorne actually to make the first quantitative assessment of the Moon's apparent acceleration. Later, during the eighteenth century, Richard Dunthorne estimated the rate as +10\\" (arcseconds/century2) in terms of the resulting difference in lunar longitude, \\\\-- also given in Philosophical Transactions (abridgements) (1809), vol.9 (for 1744‚Äì49), pp. 669‚Äì675 as \\"On the Acceleration of the Moon, by the Rev. Richard Dunthorne\\". an effect that became known as the secular acceleration of the Moon. Pierre-Simon Laplace had given an explanation in 1787 in terms of changes in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. He considered only the radial gravitational force on the Moon from the Sun and Earth but obtained close agreement with the historical record of observations. In 1820, at the insistence of the Acad√©mie des sciences, Damoiseau, Plana and Francesco Carlini revisited Laplace's work, investigating quadratic and higher-order perturbing terms, and obtained similar results, again addressing only a radial, and neglecting tangential, gravitational force on the Moon. Hansen obtained similar results in 1842 and 1847. In 1853, Adams published a paper showing that, while tangential terms vanish in the first-order theory of Laplace, they become substantial when quadratic terms are admitted. Small terms integrated in time come to have large effects and Adams concluded that Plana had overestimated the secular acceleration by approximately 1.66\\" per century. At first, Le Verrier rejected Adams's results. In 1856, Plana admitted Adams's conclusions, claiming to have revised his own analysis and arrived at the same results. However, he soon recanted, publishing a third result different both from Adams's and Plana's own earlier work. Delaunay in 1859 calculated the fourth-order term and duplicated Adams's result leading Adams to publish his own calculations for the fifth, sixth and seventh-order terms. Adams now calculated that only 5.7\\" of the observed 11\\" was accounted for by gravitational effects. Later that year, Philippe Gustave Doulcet, Comte de Pont√©coulant published a claim that the tangential force could have no effect though Peter Andreas Hansen, who seems to have cast himself in the role of arbitrator, declared that the burden of proof rested on Pont√©coulant, while lamenting the need to discover a further effect to account for the balance. Much of the controversy centred around the convergence of the power series expansion used and, in 1860, Adams duplicated his results without using a power series. Sir John Lubbock also duplicated Adams's results and Plana finally concurred. Adams's view was ultimately accepted and further developed, winning him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866. The unexplained drift is now known to be due to tidal acceleration. In 1858 Adams became professor of mathematics at the University of St Andrews, but lectured only for a session, before returning to Cambridge for the Lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry. Two years later he succeeded Challis as director of the Cambridge Observatory, a post Adams held until his death. The Leonids The Leonids The great meteor shower of November 1866 turned his attention to the Leonids, whose probable path and period had already been discussed and predicted by Hubert Anson Newton in 1864. Newton had asserted that the longitude of the ascending node, that marked where the shower would occur, was increasing and the problem of explaining this variation attracted some of Europe's leading astronomers. Using a powerful and elaborate analysis, Adams ascertained that this cluster of meteors, which belongs to the Solar System, traverses an elongated ellipse in 33.25 years, and is subject to definite perturbations from the larger planets, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. These results were published in 1867. Some experts consider this Adams's most substantial achievement. His \\"definitive orbit\\" for the Leonids coincided with that of the comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle and thereby suggested the, later widely accepted, close relationship between comets and meteors. Later career Portrait of John Couch Adams by Hubert von Herkomer, circa 1888 Ten years later, George William Hill described a novel and elegant method for attacking the problem of lunar motion. Adams briefly announced his own unpublished work in the same field, which, following a parallel course had confirmed and supplemented Hill's. Over a period of forty years, he periodically addressed the determination of the constants in Carl Friedrich Gauss's theory of terrestrial magnetism. Again, the calculations involved great labour, and were not published during his lifetime. They were edited by his brother, William Grylls Adams, and appear in the second volume of the collected Scientific Papers. Numerical computation of this kind might almost be described as his pastime. He calculated the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant, perhaps somewhat eccentrically, to 236 decimal places and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the 62nd. Adams had boundless admiration for Newton and his writings and many of his papers bear the cast of Newton's thought. In 1872, Isaac Newton Wallop, 5th Earl of Portsmouth, donated his private collection of Newton's papers to Cambridge University. Adams and G. G. Stokes took on the task of arranging the material, publishing a catalogue in 1888.A Catalogue of the Portsmouth Collection of Books and Papers written by or belonging to Sir Isaac Newton, the Scientific Part of which has been Presented by the Earl of Portsmouth to the University of Cambridge, drawn up by the Syndicate appointed 6 November 1982, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1888 The post of Astronomer Royal was offered him in 1881, but he preferred to pursue his teaching and research in Cambridge. He was British delegate to the International Meridian Conference at Washington in 1884, when he also attended the meetings of the British Association at Montreal and of the American Association at Philadelphia.

I. M. Stewart (1906-1994), and published between 1974 and 1978 by Victor Gollancz in London. The word \\"Surrey\\" in the title of the quintet refers to student accommodation in an imaginary Oxford college. (A staircase, in the more traditionally designed colleges, is a group of students' rooms, with a ground-floor entrance leading off a quadrangle.) The series The books, in order of publication, are: *The Gaudy (1974) *Young Patullo (1975) *A Memorial Service (1976) *The Madonna of the Astrolabe (1977) *Full Term (1978) Plot The narrator and central character is playwright Duncan Patullo, son of Lachlan Patullo, a noted Scottish artist specializing in landscapes but occasionally painting portraits. He is educated in Edinburgh, at a school clearly intended to recall Fettes, and then at the unnamed College in Oxford (of which Surrey is one of the quadrangles) as the John Ruskin Scholar. In the first novel of the sequence, The Gaudy, Patullo returns to his Oxford College, after a long absence (and a successful career as a playwright, including extended residence abroad), and encounters a number of old friends, including Albert Talbert, his former tutor in English Literature; Lord Marchpayne, formerly Tony Mumford (an undergraduate contemporary who lived in the set of rooms opposite his); fellow Scot and schoolmate Ranald McKechnie, now Regius Professor of Greek at the college (McKechnie's wife, Janet, is Duncan's first love); Cyril Bedworth (now the college's Senior Tutor but formerly an undergraduate friend who lived at the top of Patullo's staircase); and Robert Damien (College doctor, but also a contemporary of Patullo's who embarrassed him by replacing the sketch for a famous painting that he owned with a bawdy picture of Mumford's at exactly the point when the great and the good had assembled to view it). The second novel, Young Patullo, tells the story of their former relationships and Patullo's undergraduate career. In A Memorial Service Patullo is instrumental in resolving the crisis caused by the academic insufficiency and aggressively anti-institutional behaviour of Ivo Mumford, his friend Tony's son, and begins a tentative involvement with his cousin Fiona Petrie, a don at one of the women's Colleges, as well as rekindling a friendship with Janet McKechnie. The title refers obliquely to the character of Paul Lusby, who committed suicide in the first novel as a result of a foolish wager proposed by Ivo Mumford, and whose brother Peter is seeking admission to the College, partly in memory of his brother. In The Madonna of the Astrolabe Patullo has to cope with his ex-wife and her sexual designs on current undergraduates, the undergraduates' production of Tamburlaine, and the problems of raising enough money for the urgently needed restoration of the crumbling Great Tower (modelled on Tom Tower). The discovery of a lost masterpiece by Piero della Francesca proves crucial to the college's future fortunes, and Patullo is able to help when it is stolen. Full Term takes up Patullo's emotional conflicts but focuses on the scandalous, and apparently treasonous, behaviour of the College's Physics tutor, William Watershute, which are dramatically resolved at the end. Background The College, which is not named in the novels, is very clearly based on one of Stewart's own Colleges, Christ Church, where he was Student (i.e. Fellow and Tutor) from 1949 until 1973, and University Reader in English. Surrey is modelled on Peckwater Quadrangle, which houses the College library as the novels suggest, but does not have a statue of a former Head of House (in the middle of Surrey there is a statue of Provost Harbage). The character of the Provost (Head of the College) is based on that of Henry Chadwick, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford during Stewart's own time there.Williams, Rowan, Obituary‚ÄîHenry Chadwick‚ÄîHe was a leading Anglican scholar and strove for ecumenicalism, The Guardian', 19 June 2008. Retrieved 2008-06-26. His name is taken from that of Edward Pococke (1604-91), seventeenth century Regius Professor of Hebrew (1648-91), after whom the Pococke Tree (the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky) and the Pococke Garden in Christ Church are named.https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/pococke-garden Fantasy writer and Oxford don J. R. R. Tolkien appears (or is remembered) as the elderly \\"Professor J. B. Timbermill\\" in all the novels. The character of Arnold Lempriere, an ancient and semi-retired history don at the College, is based on the eccentric Christ Church Censor R. H. Dundas. Tony Mumford's title \\"Marchpayne\\" is obviously both a nod to the Marquess of Marchmain, a character in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited (another novel partly set in Christ Church, Oxford), but also a joke on \\"marchpane\\", an old name for marzipan. Stewart makes an oblique reference to himself in Full Term: 'the other [new fellow], bald and abraded, was understood to have escaped in middle age from some professorial assignment in the antipodes' (p. 37) ‚Äì Stewart had been Jury Professor of English at the University of Adelaide before obtaining his post in Christ Church. Evaluation Stewart's sequence of novels is much appreciated for his learned allusiveness and the sheer polish of his narrative style, for his command of irony, and for his remarkable gift for accompanying dialogue with an acute psychological commentary on the contextual motivation for what is said. The quintet is unashamedly nostalgic for an era of Oxford manners that was in the 1970s waning if not already gone, and this has put some readers off (whilst probably attracting others). He reproduces authentic views held by the community he evokes about society, sex, politics, race and education that are by no means widely held nowadays. Few readers will now acquiesce in many of the assumptions made or implied in these areas by the characters or even the narrator. Stewart narrates a world in which privilege and snobbery are normal; he critiques this, but he does not transcend it. In the story about Ivo Mumford's parachuting out of a rape charge a modern reader will surely regret any meaningful reflection on the situation of the victim. The sense that \\"boys will be boys\\" abounds in these novels, and there is a simplistic acceptance (on a narrative level) of the normality of class distinction and the way this impacts upon educational opportunity and success. Nevertheless, there is much sensitivity shown towards students who encounter problems. The novels are valuable above all for their insight into the social and intellectual dynamics of academic communities. In this respect Stewart is much more insightful than C.P. Snow, some of whose \\"Strangers and Brothers\\" novels from a previous era focus on similar bodies of people, and he is no less successful in plot- construction than his Cambridge counterpart.

It is generally believed to relate to the traditional student song, De Brevitate Vitae (On the Shortness of Life), which is commonly known as the Gaudeamus (Let's make merry) by virtue of its first word.  University of Oxford  At the University of Oxford a gaudy ('gaude' at New College, Oxford, pronounced the same) is a college feast. It is often a reunion for its alumni. The origin of the term may be connected to the traditional student anthem, Gaudeamus. Gaudies generally involve a celebratory formal dinner, generally in black tie and academic gowns (scarlet festal robes for doctors), and may include events such as chapel services, lectures or concerts beforehand. For reunions, the invitees are generally graduate alumni from a number of (usually two or three) consecutive matriculation years, e.g. 1999‚Äì2001. Typically, gaudies are held for each year-group on around a ten- year cycle.  Durham University  At St Chad's College the College feastday begins with a proclamation of the feast and includes an early rise, college invasions, green breakfast, as well as a host of competitions that see students spread out into the City vying to win various awards. More serious highlights include a service in the Cathedral and musical performances in the Quad. Alumni have a parallel set of events on or around the same day in Durham and (usually) in London. Previous events that were termed 'gaudies' are now more often called 'feasts' (by the college) or 'mega-formals' (by the JCR): these are all black-tie and gowned affairs that occur several times a term to mark major feasts and special events.  Universities of Dundee and St Andrews  At the University of Dundee, gaudie nights are traditional student celebrations involving the issue of junior students with senior 'academic parents' in order to introduce them to higher education and to provide socialisation. These events are usually held a short time after the institution's Freshers' Week. The Night itself involves the academic parents (typically one male, one female) taking their younger charges out for an evening's entertainment at the parent's expense. These evenings are followed by a Raisin Night which is used by the junior students to thank the academic parents (usually in a ritualised fashion) for gaudie night. This typical happens at some point in the early winter of the first semester. Similar traditions remain at Dundee's erstwhile parent institution, the University of St Andrews, but are however incorporated into a Raisin Weekend and the term gaudie night is not used for the first night. Many traditions surround this event including Raisin receipts in Latin, a foam fight and Raisin strings given by the academic mother to be hung on the Bejant/Bejantine's academic gown. St Andrews has a separate ceremony known as the gaudie which involves a gowned torchlight procession and singing of the Gaudeamus in memory of a student, John Honey who risked his life in 1800 to save survivors of a shipping accident offshore.  University of Aberdeen  At the University of Aberdeen, the Gaudie is the name of the student newspaper produced under the auspices of the Aberdeen University Students' Association. It is recognised as the oldest student newspaper in Scotland.  University of Reading  Wantage Hall, one of the university's halls of residence, holds an annual Freshers Gaudie, which is a legacy from when the University of Reading was an extension college of Christ Church, Oxford University.  Schools  * At St Edward's School, Oxford and Radley College in Oxfordshire, gaudy is the name given to the end of year celebrations; occasionally taking the form of an evening event.  Cultural references  The Lord Peter Wimsey mystery Gaudy Night, by Dorothy Sayers, is partly set at such a reunion at a fictional women's college at Oxford.

It is part of the traditional region of Grenland. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Porsgrunn. The municipality of Porsgrunn was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The town of Brevik and the rural district of Eidanger were merged into the municipality of Porsgrunn on 1 January 1964. The conurbation of Porsgrunn and Skien is considered by Statistics Norway to be the seventh-largest city in Norway. General information =Name= The place is first mentioned in 1576 (\\"Porsgrund\\") by the writer Peder Clauss√∏n Friis in his work Concerning the Kingdom of Norway (see the article: Norwegian literature). He writes: \\"Two and a half miles from the sea, the Skien river flows into the fjord, and that place is called Porsgrund.\\" The name was probably given during medieval times to the then swampy area by the nuns of Gims√∏y Abbey, who went here to collect the shrub pors (\\"Bog Myrtle\\"), and the Norwegian word grunn meaning \\"ground\\". Prior to 1931, the name was spelled \\"Porsgrund\\". =Coat-of-arms= The coat of arms is from modern times. They were granted on 16 January 1905. The arms were devised in 1905 when the city needed a new city hall. The silver bend is the small river running through the city. The upper half shows a silver-colored branch of bog myrtle on a red background and is thus a canting symbol. The silver anchor on a blue background symbolizes the importance of the local harbor. History Porsgrunn City Hall Porsgrunn has been an important harbor town in the Grenland area since the late 16th century. In 1653, the Customs House was moved further down the Telemarksvassdraget from Skien to Porsgrunn mainly because industrial waste such as sawdust and mud made the river too shallow to allow boats to go any further up the river. Moving the Custom House to Porsgrunn added to the flourishing harbor activity and Porsgrunn became a thriving market town. In the 18th century, it was the home of some of Norway's most influential families at the time, such as the Aalls, Cappelens, L√∏venskiolds, and Deichmans. Also in this period, Porsgrunn was considered the cultural centre of Norway. On the ecclesiastical side, Porsgrunn was separated from the ancient rural parishes of Eidanger, Solum, and Gjerpen in 1764 to become a prestegjeld with its own minister. Churches within the Porsgrunn prestegjeld include √òstre Porsgrunn Church and Vestre Porsgrunn Church. The city was granted limited city status in 1807, but this was expanded to full city status in 1842. Porsgrunn was once home to Skomv√¶r, the country's largest sailing ship. In 1985, the sculpture Amphitrite, the wave and the sea birds was unveiled in Porsgrunn. The sculpture, which is one of J√∏rleif Uthaug's best known works, has a nautical theme in honor of Porsgrunn's maritime history. Geography The river flowing through the town Porsgrunn borders the municipalities of Skien and Siljan to the north, Bamble in the west, and Larvik in the east. It is part of a cluster of municipalities in southern Telemark that constitute the Grenland area of Norway. The city is situated near Gunneklevfjord, and at the mouth of the river Telemarksvassdraget or Porsgrunn River (Porsgrunnselva). The peninsula of Her√∏ya, southeast of the city, was originally an industrial park and has grown into a suburb of Porsgrunn. Industry Porsgrunn is an important center of industry and has a long history of heavy industry. Important industries in Porsgrunn include: Transportation Transportation links from Porsgrunn: *Bus (Oslo, Kristiansand, Notodden) *Train (stops at Porsgrunn Station) **The Vestfold Line to Drammen and onwards to Oslo **The Bratsberg Line to Skien and Notodden *Ferry (Fjordb√•tene i Brevik) Notable residents International relations =Twin towns ‚Äî Sister cities= The following cities are twinned with Porsgrunn: * Zenica, Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina * Kisumu, Nyanza Province, Kenya * Sigtuna, Stockholm County, Sweden * S√∏nderborg, Region of Southern Denmark, Denmark * Sundsvall, Sweden References =Footnotes= =Books= * Harald Hals (1968).

D. Nabokov in his World War I officer's uniform, 1914 Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov (; 21 July 1870 - 28 March 1922) was a Russian criminologist, journalist, and progressive statesman during the last years of the Russian Empire. He was the father of Russian-American author Vladimir Nabokov.  Early life  Nabokov was born in Tsarskoe Selo, into a wealthy and aristocratic family. His father Dmitry Nabokov (1827-1904) was a Justice Minister in the reign of Alexander II from 1878 to 1885, and his mother Maria von Korff (1842‚Äì1926) was a Baroness from a prominent Baltic German family in Courland. He studied criminal law at the University of St. Petersburg and taught criminology at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence. Nabokov married Elena Ivanovna Rukavishnikova in 1897 with whom he had five children. Their eldest son was the writer and lepidopterist Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, who portrayed his father in his memoirs (Speak, Memory, 1967) and included in his novel Pale Fire a scene of misdirected assassination evoking the death of his father. Other children were Sergey (1900-1945), Kirill (1911-1964), Elena (1906‚Äì2000) and Olga (1903-1978), who was a childhood friend of novelist Ayn Rand.Heller, Anne C., Ayn Rand and the World She Made, 2009, Nan A. Talese, p. 26‚Äì27. Career From 1904 until 1917 he was the editor of the liberal newspaper Rech (\\"The Speech\\"). A prominent member of the Constitutional Democratic Party (CD, the \\"Kadets\\"), Nabokov was elected to Russia's parliament, the First Duma. He was regarded as the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the Russian Empire, continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under Tsar Alexander II successfully opposed anti-semitic measures being passed in the government. He was also a passionate opponent of the death penalty. He was identified with the party's \\"center\\" and in favor of working with left-wing parties during the First State Duma and again during Russia's second revolutionary period. In 1917, after the February Revolution, Nabokov helped draft the document for Grand Duke Michael's refusal of the throne. Nabokov was made secretary to the Provisional Government; however, he was forced to leave St. Petersburg in December 1917 after the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolshevik revolution. In 1918 he served as minister of justice in the Crimean Regional Government, where he and his family had taken refuge. In 1919 the Nabokovs fled to England and later settled in Berlin. From 1920 until his death, Nabokov was the editor of the Russian √©migr√© newspaper Rul (\\"The Rudder\\"), which continued to advocate a pro-Western democratic government in Russia. Death Nabokov attended a CD political conference in Berlin on 28 March 1922. During the proceedings, Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork and Sergey Taboritsky approached the stage singing the Tsarist national anthem and then opened fire on liberal politician and publisher Pavel Milyukov. In response, Nabokov jumped off the stage and wrestled the gunman down to the floor. Taboritsky then shot Nabokov twice, killing him instantly. The assailants failed even to wound their intended target Milyukov. The assassins were subsequently convicted of the murder and sentenced to a 14-year prison term, but served only a fraction. The German judicial system was more lenient with right-wing criminals than with their leftist counterparts. Upon his release, Shabelsky-Bork befriended Alfred Rosenberg, the notorious Nazi ideologue. Nabokov is buried at the Berlin-Tegel Russian Orthodox Cemetery. Personal life Nabokov was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia‚Äôs Peoples.

He is best known for writing the Swallows and Amazons series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. The books remain popular and Swallows and Amazons is the basis for a tourist industry around Windermere and Coniston Water, the two lakes Ransome adapted as his fictional North Country lake. He also wrote about the literary life of London, and about Russia before, during, and after the revolutions of 1917. His connection with the leaders of the Revolution led to him providing information to the Secret Intelligence Service, while he was also suspected of being a Soviet spy by MI5. Early life Ransome was the son of Cyril Ransome (1851‚Äì1897) and his wife Edith Ransome (n√©e Baker Boulton) (1862‚Äì1944). Edwards, John H, Edward Baker Boulton: Australia's Forgotten Artist, Norrong Press, Sydney, 2004 Arthur was the eldest of four children: he had two sisters Cecily and Joyce, and a brother Geoffrey who was killed in the First World War in 1918. Joyce married into the Lupton family, well-connected industrialists and politicians; she named one of her sons Arthur Ralph Ransome Lupton. Ransome was born in Leeds;The Last Englishman: the Double Life of Arthur Ransome by Roland Chambers: review; The Telegraph, 20 Aug. 2009: subscription required. the house at 6 Ash Grove, in the Hyde Park area, has a blue plaque beside the door commemorating his birthplace. Ransome's father was professor of history at Yorkshire College (now the University of Leeds). The family regularly holidayed at Nibthwaite in the Lake District, and he was carried up to the top of Coniston Old Man as an infant. His father's premature death in 1897 had a lasting effect on him. His mother did not want him to abandon his studies for writing, but was later supportive of his books. She urged him to publish The Picts and the Martyrs in 1943, although his second wife Evgenia hated it; Genia was often discouraging about his books while he was writing them. Ransome was educated first in Windermere and then at Rugby School (where he lived in the same study room that had been used by Lewis Carroll) but did not entirely enjoy the experience, because of his poor eyesight, lack of athletic skill, and limited academic achievement. He studied chemistry at Yorkshire College, where his late father had worked. Writing career After a year at Yorkshire College, he abandoned his studies and went to London to become a writer. He took low-paying jobs as an office assistant in a publishing company and as editor of a failing magazine, Temple Bar Magazine, while establishing himself as a member of the literary scene. Some of Ransome's early works were The Nature Books for Children, a series of children's books commissioned by Anthony Treherne. Only three of the six planned volumes were published before the publisher went bankrupt. They are available on the All Things Ransome website.Nature Books for Children PDFs In his first important book, Bohemia in London (1907), Ransome introduced the history of the city's Bohemian literary and artistic communities and some of its current representatives. A curiosity in 1903 about a visiting Japanese poet, Yone Noguchi, led to an ongoing friendship with Japanese painter (and Chelsea neighbour) Yoshio Markino, who in turn introduced him to the Bohemian circle of Pamela Colman Smith, an artist best known for illustrating the Rider-Waite tarot deck. Ransome married Ivy Constance Walker in 1909 and they had one daughter, Tabitha. It was not a happy marriage: Ransome found his wife's demands to spend less time on writing and more with her and their daughter a great strain; his biographer Hugh Brogan writes that \\"it was impossible to be a good husband to Ivy\\". They divorced in 1924.Brogan (1984), pp 84; 281 Ransome began writing books of biography and literary criticism on various authors; one on Edgar Allan Poe was published in 1910 and another on Oscar Wilde in 1912. However, the latter embroiled him in a libel suit with Lord Alfred Douglas. His wife attended the 1913 trial, sitting in the public gallery as Ransome would not let her sit beside him. Her apparent enjoyment of the public notoriety the case attracted added to the stress on their marriage. The publisher Daniel Macmillan dined with the couple every day during the trial so that Ivy could not quarrel with Arthur.Brogan (1984), p 90 Ransome won the suit, supported by Robbie Ross, the editor of De Profundis. Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit.The Edinburgh Gazette Publication date:17 January 1913 Issue: 12530, Page 77 Ransome did, however, remove the offending passages from the second edition of his bookRansome, Arthur, Oscar Wilde ‚Äì A Critical Study, 2nd edition, Methuen, 1913 and refused all interviews, despite the obvious publicity value. Adding to Ransome's \\"wretched\\" 13 months waiting for the case to come to trial was the action of his publisher, Charles Granville. Oscar Wilde, a critical study had been prepared under the guidance of publisher Martin Secker, but Granville had promised better returns and a guaranteed and steady income. Secker agreed to release the rights, and Ransome handed Poe and Wilde over to Granville. The work on Wilde was well received and successful, running to eight editions, but Ransome saw little in return; in 1912 Granville was charged with embezzlement and fled the country, leaving Ransome to struggle even to register himself as a creditor of Granville's ruined company. Furthermore, his neglect of his health (he suffered from piles and a stomach ulcer) had been exacerbated by the pressure of defending the legal action.Brogan (1984), pp 77; 84 Ransome had also been working on a similar literary biography of Robert Louis Stevenson, but that was abandoned with the manuscript in the first draft and not rediscovered until 1999. It was subsequently edited and finally published almost a century later in 2011 as Arthur Ransome's Long-lost Study of Robert Louis Stevenson. Foreign correspondent In 1913 Ransome left his first wife and daughter and went to Russia to study its folklore. In 1915, Ransome published The Elixir of Life (published by Methuen, London), which was to be his only full-length novel apart from the Swallows and Amazons series. It is a gothic romance concerning a youth who chances upon an alchemist who has discovered the titular elixir of life, whose powers must be renewed by the spilling of human blood. He published Old Peter's Russian Tales, a collection of 21 folktales from Russia, the following year. After the start of the First World War, in 1914, he became a foreign correspondent and covered the war on the Eastern Front for a radical newspaper, The Daily News. He also covered the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and came to sympathise with the Bolshevik cause, becoming personally close to a number of its leaders, including Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and Karl Radek. He met the woman who would become his second wife, Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina, who then worked as Trotsky's personal secretary.Brogan (1984), p 153 Ransome provided some information to British officials and the British Secret Intelligence Service, which gave him the code name S.76 in their files. Bruce Lockhart said in his memoirs: \\"Ransome was a Don Quixote with a walrus moustache, a sentimentalist who could always be relied upon to champion the underdog, and a visionary whose imagination had been fired by the revolution. He was on excellent terms with the Bolsheviks and frequently brought us information of the greatest value.\\" Nonetheless in March 1919, on one of his return visits to the United Kingdom, the authorities interviewed him and threatened him with exposure as an agent.Brogan (1984), p 235 In October 1919, Ransome met Reginald Leeper of the Foreign Office's Political Intelligence Department, who required Ransome privately to submit his articles and public speaking engagements for approval. Ransome's response was \\"indignant\\". Unbeknown to Leeper, Ransome's \\"near treason[ous]\\" articles were written to buttress his exceptional access to the Bolshevik leadership. MI5, the British Security Service, was suspicious that Ransome and his fellow journalist, M. Philips Price, were a threat because of their opposition to the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War. In October 1919, as Ransome was returning to Moscow on behalf of The Manchester Guardian, the Estonian foreign minister Ants Piip entrusted him to deliver a secret armistice proposal to the Bolsheviks. At that time, the Estonians were fighting their War of Independence alongside the White movement of counter-revolutionary forces. After crossing the battle lines on foot, Ransome passed the message, which, to preserve secrecy, had not been written down and depended for its authority only on the high personal regard in which he was held in both countries, to diplomat Maxim Litvinov in Moscow. To deliver the reply, which accepted Piip's conditions for peace, Ransome had to return by the same risky means, but now, he had Evgenia with him. Estonia withdrew from the conflict, and Ransome and Evgenia set up home together in the capital Reval (Tallinn).Brogan (1984), pp 242‚Äì248 After the Allied intervention, Ransome remained in the Baltic states and built a cruising yacht, Racundra. He wrote a successful book about his experiences, Racundra's First Cruise. He joined the staff of The Manchester Guardian when he returned to Russia and the Baltic states. Following his divorce, he married Evgenia and brought her to live in England, where he continued writing for The Guardian, often on foreign affairs, and also writing the \\"Country Diary\\" column on fishing. On the Ransomes' return to England, Racundra was sold to the yachting author Kaines Adlard Coles, who sailed her back to England. Swallows and Amazons series By the late 1920s, Ransome had settled in the Lake District because he had decided not to accept a position as a full-time foreign correspondent with The Guardian newspaper. Instead he wrote Swallows and Amazons in 1929‚Äîthe first of the series that made his reputation as one of the bestQuoted from English writers of children's books. Ransome apparently based the Walker children (the \\"Swallows\\") in the book partly on the Altounyan family. He had a long-standing friendship with the mother of the Altounyans, and their Collingwood grandparents. Later, he denied the connection, claiming he only gave the Altounyans' names to his own characters; it appears to have upset him that people did not regard the characters as original creations. Ransome's writing is noted for his detailed descriptions of activities. Although he used many actual features from the Lake District landscape, he invented his own geography, mixing descriptions of different places to create his own juxtapositions. His move to East Anglia brought a change of location for four of the books, and Ransome started using the real landscape and geography of East Anglia, so that one can use the maps printed in the books as a guide to the real area. Ransome's own interest in sailing and his need to provide an accurate description caused him to undertake a voyage across the North Sea to Flushing. His book We Didn't Mean To Go To Sea reflects that, and he based the fictional Goblin on his own boat Nancy Blackett (which in turn took its name from a character in the series). Two or three of the Swallows and Amazons books have less realistic plots. The original concept of Peter Duck was a story made up by the children themselves, and Peter Duck had appeared in the preceding volume, Swallowdale, as a character whom the children created, but Ransome dropped the foreword of explanation from Peter Duck before it was published. Although relatively straightforward, the story, together with its equally unrealistic ostensible sequel Missee Lee,Wardale (1991:170) is much more fantastic than the rest of the series. A trip to China as a foreign correspondent provided Ransome with the imaginative springboard for Missee Lee, in which readers find the Swallows and the Amazons sailing around the world in the schooner Wild Cat from Peter Duck. Together with Captain Flint (the Amazons' uncle Jim Turner), they become the captives of Chinese pirates. The final book of the series, Great Northern? (1947) was set in Scotland, and while the plot and action appear realistic, the internal chronology does not fit the usual run of school holiday adventures. Myles North, an admirer of Ransome, provided much of the basic plot of the book. Swallows and Amazons was so popular that it inspired a number of other authors to write in a similar vein. Most notably, two schoolchildren, Pamela Whitlock and Katharine Hull, wrote The Far-Distant Oxus, an adventure story set on Exmoor. Whitlock sent the manuscript to Ransome in March 1937, and he persuaded his publisher, Jonathan Cape, to produce it, characterising it as \\"the best children's book of 1937\\".Brogan (1984), 353. Sailing After the sale of Racundra in 1925 (in Coles' ownership she became Annette II), Ransome went on (in addition to the occasional charter, loan or trial sail) to own five further cruising yachts. His next yacht was the Hillyard-built Nancy Blackett, which he owned from 1935 to 1938. She was originally named Spindrift when launched in 1931.

After the war, he commissioned a ketch from Laurent Giles, again built in Pin Mill by Harry King: Peter Duck. He owned her from 1947 to 1949; her design was the basis for a class of which over 40 were built.Article about Peter Duck at classicboat.co.uk In July, 1951, he saw Norvad, a Hillyard five-and-a-half ton centre-cockpit yacht. With Evgenia, he had a trial sail in Norvad the following month in a hard offshore wind. They decided to get one, which he had decided should bear the name Lottie Blossom, and put in an order for that year's Boat Show model. With a list of things they wanted done to modify the boat below decks from the standard production model, the boat was launched on 1 April 1952. Ransome's health problems delayed their first sail to 15 April. In December 1952, he sold Lottie Blossom to Sir William Paul Mallinson on condition that he (Ransome) retained the name. Lottie Blossom II followed early the next year, using the same design of hull, but with aft cockpit and tiller steering. They had two very happy seasons in her, sailing her comfortably on their own, including two voyages to Cherbourg. The second voyage, in 1954, at the age of 70, was to be Ransome's last long passage. Personal life Ransome married twice, first to Ivy Constance Walker in 1909, with whom he had a daughter, Tabitha Ransome; the couple divorced in 1924. His second marriage, that same year, was to Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina. Although MI5 appeared satisfied with Ransome's loyalty to Britain by 1937, KGB files that were opened following the end of the Soviet Union suggest that Evgenia Ransome, at least, was involved in smuggling diamonds from the USSR to Paris to help fund the Comintern. This is examined in the 2009 book The Last Englishman: the Double Life of Arthur Ransome by Roland Chambers. Ransome and his second wife are buried in the same grave. Death Ransome died in a Greater Manchester hospital in 1967. He and his wife Evgenia are buried in the churchyard of St Paul's Church, Rusland, Cumbria, in the southern Lake District. The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome, edited by Rupert Hart-Davis, was published posthumously in 1976. It covers his life only to the completion of Peter Duck in 1931. Awards and accolades Ransome won the inaugural Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising Pigeon Post in the Swallows and Amazons series as the year's best children's book by a British subject.Carnegie Winner 1936.

In 2000, Incidents.org started to cooperate with DShield to create a Consensus Incidents Database (CID). It collected security information from cooperating sites and agencies for mass analysis. On March 22, 2001, the SANS CID was responsible for the early detection of the \\"Lion\\" worm attacks on various facilities. The quick warning and counter-efforts organized by the CID were instrumental in controlling the damage done by this worm, which otherwise might have been considerably worse. Later, DShield was integrated closer into incidents.org as the SANS Institute started to sponsor DShield. The CID was renamed the \\"Internet Storm Center\\" in acknowledgement of the way it uses the distributed sensor network similar to the way a weather reporting center will detect and track an atmospheric storm and provide warnings. Since that time the ISC has expanded its monitoring operations; its website cites a figure of over twenty million \\"intrusion detection log entries\\" per day. It continues to provide analyses and alerts of security threats to the Internet community. During the last hours of 2005 and the first weeks of 2006, the Internet Storm Center went to its longest period at the time to \\"yellow\\" on the Infocon for the WMF vulnerability. The most prominent feature of the ISC is a daily \\"Handler Diary\\" which is prepared by one of the 40 volunteer incident handlers and summarized the events of the day.

First published in 1774, it reappeared as a revised edition in 1787. It was one of the most important novels in the Sturm und Drang period in German literature, and influenced the later Romantic movement. Goethe, aged 24 at the time, finished Werther in five-and-a-half weeks of intensive writing in January‚ÄìMarch 1774. The book's publication instantly placed the author among the foremost international literary celebrities, and was among the best known of his works. Plot summary Charlotte at Werther's grave Most of The Sorrows of Young Werther, a story about unrequited love, is presented as a collection of letters written by Werther, a young artist of a sensitive and passionate temperament, to his friend Wilhelm. These give an intimate account of his stay in the fictional village of Wahlheim (based on Garbenheim, near Wetzlar), whose peasants have enchanted him with their simple ways. There he meets Charlotte, a beautiful young girl who takes care of her siblings after the death of their mother. Werther falls in love with Charlotte despite knowing beforehand that she is engaged to a man named Albert, eleven years her senior. Despite the pain it causes him, Werther spends the next few months cultivating a close friendship with them both. His sorrow eventually becomes so unsupportable that he is forced to leave Wahlheim for Weimar, where he makes the acquaintance of Fr√§ulein von B. He suffers great embarrassment when he forgetfully visits a friend and unexpectedly has to face there the weekly gathering of the entire aristocratic set. He is not tolerated and asked to leave since he is not a nobleman. He then returns to Wahlheim, where he suffers still more than before, partly because Charlotte and Albert are now married. Every day becomes a torturing reminder that Charlotte will never be able to requite his love. She, out of pity for her friend and respect for her husband, decides that Werther must not visit her so frequently. He visits her one final time, and they are both overcome with emotion after he recites to her a passage of his own translation of Ossian. Even before that incident, Werther had hinted at the idea that one member of the love triangle ‚Äì Charlotte, Albert or Werther himself ‚Äì had to die to resolve the situation. Unable to hurt anyone else or seriously consider murder, Werther sees no other choice but to take his own life. After composing a farewell letter to be found after his death, he writes to Albert asking for his two pistols, on the pretext that he is going \\"on a journey\\". Charlotte receives the request with great emotion and sends the pistols. Werther then shoots himself in the head, but does not die until twelve hours later. He is buried between two lime trees that he had mentioned frequently in his letters. The funeral is not attended by any clergy, or by Albert or Charlotte. The book ends with an intimation that Charlotte may die of a broken heart: \\"I shall say nothing of...Charlotte's grief. ... Charlotte's life was despaired of.\\" Effect on Goethe Goethe portrait in profile Werther was one of Goethe's few works aligned with the aesthetic, social and philosophical ideals that pervaded the German proto-Romantic movement known as Sturm und Drang, before he and Friedrich von Schiller moved into Weimar Classicism. The novel was published anonymously, and Goethe distanced himself from it in his later years, regretting the fame it had brought him and the consequent attention to his own youthful love of Charlotte Buff, then already engaged to Johann Christian Kestner. Although he wrote Werther at the age of 24, it was all for which some of his visitors in his old age knew him. His views of literature had changed radically by then. He even denounced the Romantic movement as \\"everything that is sick.\\"Hunt, Lynn. The Makings of the West: Peoples and Cultures. Bedford/St. Martins Press Goethe described the powerful impact the book had on him, writing that even if Werther had been a brother of his whom he had killed, he could not have been more haunted by his vengeful ghost. Yet, Goethe substantially reworked the book for the 1787 edition and acknowledged the great personal and emotional influence that The Sorrows of Young Werther could exert on forlorn young lovers who discovered it. As he commented to his secretary in 1821, \\"It must be bad, if not everybody was to have a time in his life, when he felt as though Werther had been written exclusively for him.\\" Even fifty years after the book's publication, Goethe wrote in a conversation with Johann Peter Eckermann about the emotional turmoil he had gone through while writing the book: \\"That was a creation which I, like the pelican, fed with the blood of my own heart.\\" Cultural impact The Sorrows of Young Werther turned Goethe, previously an unknown author, into a literary celebrity almost overnight. Napoleon Bonaparte considered it one of the great works of European literature, having written a Goethe-inspired soliloquy in his youth and carried Werther with him on his campaigning to Egypt. It also started the phenomenon known as the \\"Werther Fever\\", which caused young men throughout Europe to dress in the clothing style described for Werther in the novel.A. Alvarez, The Savage God: A Story of Suicide (Norton, 1990), p. 228. Items of merchandising such as prints, decorated Meissen porcelain and even a perfume were produced. The book reputedly also led to some of the first known examples of copycat suicide. The men were often dressed in the same clothing \\"as Goethe's description of Werther and using similar pistols.\\" Often the book was found at the scene of the suicide. R√ºdiger Safranski, a modern biographer of Goethe, dismisses the Werther Effect 'as only a persistent rumor'. Nonetheless, this aspect of \\"Werther Fever\\" was watched with concern by the authorities ‚Äì both the novel and the Werther clothing style were banned in Leipzig in 1775; the novel was also banned in Denmark and Italy. It was also watched with fascination by fellow authors. One of these, Friedrich Nicolai, decided to create a satirical piece with a happy ending, entitled Die Freuden des jungen Werthers (\\"The Joys of Young Werther\\"), in which Albert, having realized what Werther is up to, loaded chicken's blood into the pistol, thereby foiling Werther's suicide, and happily concedes Charlotte to him. After some initial difficulties, Werther sheds his passionate youthful side and reintegrates himself into society as a respectable citizen.Friedrich Nicolai: Freuden des jungen Werthers. Leiden und Freuden Werthers des Mannes. Voran und zuletzt ein Gespr√§ch. Klett, Stuttgart 1980, Goethe, however, was not pleased with the Freuden and started a literary war with Nicolai that lasted all his life, writing a poem titled \\"Nicolai auf Werthers Grabe\\" (\\"Nicolai on Werther's grave\\"), in which Nicolai (here a passing nameless pedestrian) defecates on Werther's grave, so desecrating the memory of a Werther from which Goethe had distanced himself in the meantime, as he had from the Sturm und Drang. This argument was continued in his collection of short and critical poems, the Xenien, and his play Faust. Alternative versions and appearances *In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Frankenstein's monster finds the book in a leather portmanteau, along with two others ‚Äì Plutarch's Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans, and Milton's Paradise Lost. He sees Werther's case as similar to his own, of one rejected by those he loved. *The book influenced Ugo Foscolo's The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis, which tells of a young man who commits suicide, out of desperation caused not only by love, but by the political situation of Italy before the Unification. This is taken to be the first Italian epistolary novel. *Thomas Carlyle, who incidentally translated Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meister into English, frequently refers to and parodies Werther's relationship in his 1836 novel Sartor Resartus. *The statistician Karl Pearson's first book was The New Werther. *Goethe's work was the basis for the 1892 opera Werther by Jules Massenet. *William Makepeace Thackeray wrote a poem satirizing Goethe's story entitled Sorrows of Werther. *Thomas Mann's 1939 novel Lotte in Weimar recounts a fictional reunion between Goethe and his youthful passion, Charlotte Buff. *An episode of the Canadian television series History Bites features the book, with Bob Bainborough as Goethe. *Ulrich Plenzdorf, a GDR poet, wrote a satirical novel (and play) called Die neuen Leiden des jungen W.

It is the most prominent mountain peak in southern New Hampshire and is the highest point in Cheshire County. It lies southwest of Concord and northwest of Boston. At , Mount Monadnock is nearly higher than any other mountain peak within and rises above the surrounding landscape. It is known for being featured in the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Mt. Monadnock has long been cited as one of the most frequently climbed mountains in the world.NH Division of Parks & Recreation: Monadnock State Park Monadnock's bare, isolated, and rocky summit provides expansive views. It bears a number of hiking trails, including the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway.DeLorme Topo USA 6.0. (2006). Mapping software. Yarmouth, Maine:DeLorme. The summit is barren largely because of fires set by early settlers. The first major fire, set in 1800 to clear the lower slopes for pasture, swept through the stands of virgin red spruce on the summit and flanks of the mountain. Between 1810 and 1820, local farmers, who believed that wolves were denning in the blowdowns, set fire to the mountain again. The conflagration raged for weeks, destroying the topsoil and denuding the mountain above . The term \\"monadnock\\" is used by American geologists to describe any isolated mountain formed from the exposure of a harder rock as a result of the erosion of a softer one once surrounding it (a landform termed \\"inselberg\\" [\\"island-peak\\"] elsewhere in the world). Name The word \\"monadnock\\" is derived from an Abenaki word used to describe a mountain. Loosely translated, it means \\"mountain that stands alone\\",\\"Devonian Period.\\" New Hampshire Geology Home Page. Web. 23 Jan. 2011. although the exact meaning of the word is uncertain. The term was adopted by early settlers of southern New Hampshire and later by American geologists as an alternative term for an inselberg or isolated mountain. Mount Monadnock is often called Grand Monadnock, to differentiate it from other Vermont and New Hampshire peaks with \\"Monadnock\\" in their names.Baldwin, Henry I. (1989). Monadnock Guide 4th edition. Concord, New Hampshire: Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. Its official name on federal maps is \\"Monadnock Mountain\\".(http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:868516) History =The transcendentalists= Ralph Waldo EmersonHenry David Thoreau Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller visited the mountain and wrote fondly of it. Emerson was a frequent visitor, and made the mountain the subject of \\"Monadnoc\\",\\"Monadnoc\\" one of his most famous poems. Thoreau visited the mountain four times between 1844 and 1860, and spent a great deal of time observing and cataloging natural phenomena. He is regarded as having written one of the first serious naturalist inventories of the mountain. A bog near the summit of Mount Monadnock and a rocky lookout off the Cliff Walk trail are named after him; another lookout is named after Emerson. =The Halfway House and other structures= In 1858, Moses Cudworth of Rindge opened the \\"Halfway House\\" hotel on the south side of the mountain, roughly halfway from the base to the summit. The \\"Toll Road\\" was built to service it. By that time the popularity of the mountain was booming, and it was not long before Cudworth enlarged the hotel to accommodate 100 guests. On busy summer days, the stables at the Halfway House held as many as 75 horses. The Halfway House became public property when hundreds of residents of the nearby towns formed a coalition to buy the Toll Road and hotel, and worked to prevent a radio tower from being constructed on the summit. After the hotel burned down in 1954, a concession stand operated at the site until 1969. It and the toll road were both closed to public vehicles. Moses Spring, with its source in a hole drilled through a rock behind the site, is one of the few remaining artifacts of the hotel years. The foundations of two water tanks, and the nearby reservoir that fed them, are extant on the hillside above the Old Halfway House. A small firewarden's hut was located on the summit of Mount Monadnock and operated from 1911 to 1948, when it was decommissioned with the advent of modern means of detecting forest fires. The hut was used as a snack bar concession and hikers' shelter until 1969; it was removed in 1972. A small cabin, located farther down the mountain, served as the fire lookout's residence. It, too, has been removed. A private dwelling, south of the site of the former Halfway House, is the last remaining inholding on the mountain above . =Hiking history= Typical crowded summit of Mt. Monadnock on a sunny autumn day The earliest recorded ascent of Mount Monadnock took place in 1725 by Captain Samuel Willard and fourteen rangers under his command who camped at the top and used the summit as a lookout while patrolling for Native Americans. Before the practice came to be frowned upon, many early hikers carved their names in the summit; the earliest such engraving reads \\"S. Dakin, 1801\\" and is attributed to a local town clerk. Notable \\"power hiking\\" records associated with the mountain include that of Garry Harrington, who hiked to the summit 16 times in a 24-hour period, and Larry Davis, who claimed to have hiked to the summit daily for 2,850 consecutive days (7.8 years).Mount Monadnock.com Retrieved December 14, 2007American Profile.com Retrieved December 14, 2007 Monadnock is often claimed to be the second-most frequently climbed mountain in the world, after Mount Fuji in Japan. Monadnock is climbed by 125,000 hikers yearly, while Mount Fuji sees 200,000-300,000 hikers yearly.(Japanese) Mt. Fuji climber numbers for up to FY 2009. However, according to UNESCO, Tai Shan in China receives more than 2 million visitors a year, far surpassing the other two peaks in popularity.See page 17 of this UNESCO report: https://whc.unesco.org/archive/periodicreporting/apa/cycle01/section2/437.pdf Bio-geography, ecology, and geology mountain cranberry thrives on Mount Monadnock. Billings fold in quartzite and schist of the Devonian Littleton Formation Due to fires in the early 19th century which burned a majority of the top around the summit, there is little soil cover on the peak and surrounding uplands. Although the mountain has recovered to the degree that its landscape appears natural, Mount Monadnock is an example of a mountain which has an artificial tree line, occurring well below the climatic tree line of similar mountains in the region.Baldwin, Henry I. \\"The Induced Timberline of Mount Monadnock, N. H.\\", Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Vol. 104, No. 4, pp. 324‚Äì333. From the base to the summit, floral species diminish with increasingly shallow soil levels. The summit is home to many different specialized sub-alpine species which can retain moisture for long periods of time. Alpine and sub-alpine species include mountain ash, cotton grass, sheep laurel, mountain sandwort, and the mountain cranberry. Krummholz, trees stunted by harsh weather, are found on Mount Monadnock, as are several alpine bogs. Lower elevations on Mount Monadnock are clad in northern hardwood forest species; middle elevations support stands of red spruce. Before the fires, Mount Monadnock was totally covered in a red spruce forest. Since the summit has been barren of soil cover, red spruce have been slowly ascending back towards the top in a process known as ecological succession. The mountain is largely composed of 400-million-year-old schist and quartzite rock primarily associated with the Devonian Littleton Formation, which extends south into Massachusetts and north into the White Mountains.Raymo, Chet and Maureen E. Written in Stone: A Geologic History of the Northeastern United States. Globe Pequot, Chester, Connecticut, 1989. At lower elevations on the mountain, and stratigraphically below the Littleton Formation, the bedrock is from the Silurian period, consisting of Rangeley Formation schists, Perry Mountain Formation quartzites, the Francestown Formation granulite, and the Warner Formation granulite. Structurally, the mountain is part of an overturned syncline ‚Äì called a fold nappe ‚Äì that was caused by the compressional forces of the Acadian orogeny. Dramatic small- to medium-scale metamorphic folds are visible on many of the rock faces of the mountain, including the famous Billings Fold (a recumbent syncline found about west of the summit), shown in the 1942 edition of Marland P. Billings' Structural Geology.Thompson, Peter J., \\"Geology of Mount Monadnock, New Hampshire\\", in West, David P. and Bailey, Richard H., eds., Guidebook for Geological Field Trips in New England, Geological Society of America, United States, 2001 In addition to impressive folds, the Devonian Littleton Formation shows large pseudomorphs of sillimanite after andalusite that occur as \\"turkey tracks\\". USGS reference mark on the summit Hydrology Mount Monadnock lies on the divide between the Connecticut River and Merrimack River watersheds. The northern slopes of the mountain drain to Howe Reservoir, then via Minnewawa Brook to the Ashuelot River, the Connecticut River, and ultimately Long Island Sound. Gleason Brook and Mountain Brook flow off the western slopes, then via Shaker Brook to the South Branch of the Ashuelot River. The southwestern slopes of the mountain drain to Fassett Brook, then Quarry Brook, before reaching the South Branch of the Ashuelot. To the southeast of the mountain, Mead Brook and Stony Brook flow to Mountain Brook, a tributary of the Contoocook River, which flows north to the Merrimack River and ultimately the Gulf of Maine. The eastern slopes of the mountain drain to Thorndike Pond, the outlet of which (Stanley Brook) flows northeast to Nubanusit Brook, then into the Contoocook and the Merrimack.Monadnock Mountain, New Hampshire, 7.5-minute topographic map series (1984). Washington: U.S. Geological Survey Recreation Stereoscopic image of visitors to Mount Monadnock in the 19th century Mount Monadnock is open to hiking, backpacking, picnicking, and snowshoeing. Backcountry skiing is possible on some of the lower trails. A seasonal campground east of the mountain is maintained by the state of New Hampshire, but camping is not allowed anywhere else on the mountain. A per-person fee is charged (in season) to park at the Old Toll Road and State Park Headquarters trailheads. There are no roads to the summit, and the Old Toll Road, which leads to the Halfway House site, is closed to vehicles. ATVs are not allowed on the mountain.Monadnock State Park New Hampshire Department of Conservation and Recreation. Retrieved December 10, 2007. Good views of the mountain can be had from a number of regional roads and highways, especially from New Hampshire Route 124. =Trails= Near the head of the White Dot Trail Mount Monadnock is criss-crossed by many miles of well-maintained hiking trails. The most popular trails are the White Dot Trail, , the shortest but steepest ascent to summit, accessible from the Monadnock State Park headquarters and campground on the southeast side of the mountain; and the White Arrow Trail, to summit, considered the easiest ascent, via the Old Toll Road (Halfway House) trailhead on the south side of the mountain. Other major trails include: *The Marlboro Trail, on the west side of the mountain, to summit *The Dublin Path, also part of the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, on the north side to summit *The Pumpelly Trail, on the northeast side, the longest ascent, to summit *Access from the east side of the mountain is provided by the Birchtoft Trail (Gilson Pond trailhead) and several connecting trails to the summit. Other important trails include the White Cross Trail, an alternative parallel to the White Dot Trail, and the Cliff Walk, a scenic detour that shadows a ledge to the east of the White Arrow Trail. Mount Monadnock is the northern terminus of the Metacomet- Monadnock Trail (also known as the \\"M&M; Trail\\"), a hiking trail stretching south through Massachusetts to the Connecticut border.Henry Baldwin's Monadnock Guide (see ref.#5) incorrectly states that the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail runs from Mount Monadnock to Meriden, Connecticut, confusing it with the Metacomet Trail. The trail ascends the mountain from the southwest; however, there is no trailhead where that trail crosses Route 124 at the foot of the mountain, and the highway there is marked with \\"no parking\\" signs.The Metacomet-Monadnock Trail Guide (1999). 9th edition. Amherst, Massachusetts: Appalachian Mountain Club. The closest trailhead southbound on the M&M; Trail is on Bullard Road, which leads south from Route 124 half a mile west of the M&M; Trail's crossing of the state highway. The mountain is also the southern terminus of the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, a highland trail connecting Mount Monadnock and Mount Sunapee. A third long-distance trail project, the Wantastiquet-Monadnock Greenway, aims at linking Mount Monadnock with Pisgah State Park and Wantastiquet Mountain, a prominent peak in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, overlooking the town of Brattleboro, Vermont, and the Connecticut River.Chesterfield Outdoors.com Retrieved December 12, 2007. =Hiking the mountain= One mile from the summit on the White Dot Trail The four-hour round trip to the summit and back via one of the shorter trails is considered moderately challenging for the average hiker but requires no technical skills during the late spring to early fall season. Wind and weather on the exposed, rocky summit is usually harsher than below, year round. Winter storms and summer thunderstorms can be life-threatening. Winter snow and ice can linger on the trails well into May, making hiking hazardous or impossible without special equipment. The compacting of snow due to winter recreation on the more frequently used trails tends to lengthen the time it takes for the snow and ice to melt off. Stabilizers, crampons, ice axes, ski poles, and snowshoes may be helpful or necessary for winter and early spring ascents depending on ice and snow cover. Fall hiking generally requires warmer clothing, an awareness of weather conditions, and earlier ascent times. As there are few reliable water sources on the mountain and little shelter from the sun above , dehydration and heat stroke are potential hazards. The mountain and surrounding area are black bear habitat, although problem encounters with bears are rare.Southern New Hampshire Trail Guide, Appalachian Mountain Club, Boston, 1995. Advice on hiking can be solicited from Memorial Day through Columbus Day and select off-season weekends at the park headquarters on the southeast side of the mountain.

Penn began offering a full-time program in law in 1850, under the leadership of George Sharswood. In 1852, Penn was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence, then called The American Law Register, which was later renamed the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, one of the most-cited law journals in the world. Louis H. Pollak, Dean and later a judge of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In 1881 the first woman was admitted to the school, Carrie Burnham Kilgore, and in 1888 the first African American man graduated from the school, Aaron Albert Mossell.About: History ‚Ä¢ Penn Law William Draper Lewis was named dean in 1896. In 1900, the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania approved a move to the law school's current location at the intersection of 34th and Chestnut Streets.Owen Roberts, William Draper Lewis, 98 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1949) Under Lewis' deanship, the law school was one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today. As legal education became more formalized, the school initiated a three-year curriculum and instituted stringent admissions requirements. While the School continued to accept students who did not hold a bachelor's degree, it warned applicants that \\"[a] large number of those who study law are college graduates; and those who are not cannot hope, except in rare instances, to compete successfully with the college man.\\"\\"Department of Law,\\" Catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania, 1899-1900 234 (1899). After 30 years with the law school, Lewis founded the American Law Institute in 1925, which was seated in the law school and was chaired by Lewis himself. The ALI was later chaired by another of Penn Law's Deans, Herbert Funk Goodrich. Two years before Goodrich was named dean, in 1927 the law school graduated with a J.D. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, who was the first African-American woman to ever receive a Ph.D. in the United States (also from the University of Pennsylvania, in economics). The first woman to join the faculty was Martha Field in 1969; she is now a professor at Harvard Law School. From 1974 to 1978 the Dean of the law school was Louis Pollak, who later became a federal judge. In November 2019, Penn Law received a $125 million donation from the W.P. Carey Foundation, the largest single donation to any law school to date; the school was renamed University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, in honor of the foundation's first president, Penn Law alumnus Francis J.

All of Penn's schools, including the law school, and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. Much of Penn's architecture was designed by the architecture firm of Cope & Stewardson, whose principal architects combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style. The law school consists of four interconnecting buildings around a central courtyard. At the east end of the courtyard is Silverman Hall, built in 1900, housing the Levy Conference Center, classrooms, faculty offices, the Gittis Center for Clinical Legal Studies, and administrative and student offices. Directly opposite is Tanenbaum Hall, home to the Biddle Law Library several law journals, administrative offices, and student spaces. The law library houses 1,053,824 volumes and volume equivalents making it the 4th-largest law library in the country. Gittis Hall sits on the north side and has new classrooms (renovated in 2006) and new and expanded faculty offices. Opposite is Golkin Hall, which contains and includes a state-of-the-art court room, 350-seat auditorium, seminar rooms, faculty and administrative offices, a two-story entry hall, and a roof-top garden.

The Toll Public Interest Center has supported many students who have won the Skadden Fellowship, called by The Los Angeles Times \\"a legal Peace Corps.\\" Skadden Fellowship Foundation: About the Foundation In October of 2020, The Robert and Jane Toll Foundation announced that it was donating fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) to Penn Law, which is the largest gift in history to be devoted entirely to the training and support of public interest lawyers, and among the ten (10) largest gifts ever to a law school in the United States of America.{{cite weburl=https://www.inquirer.com/business/toll-public-interest-penn- law-50-million-gift-scholars-20200929.html The gift expands the Toll Public Interest Scholars and Fellows Program by doubling the number of public interest graduates in the coming decade through a combination of full and partial tuition scholarships.{{cite weburl=https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/robert-and-jane-toll-foundation-gift- penn-law-toll-public-interest-scholars Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law The Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law (CERL or Center) is a non- partisan, interdisciplinary research and policy institute at the University of Pennsylvania. CERL focuses on the application of the rule of law and ethics to pressing issues of national security, veterans' affairs, armed conflict, and transnational crises. CERL was co-founded in 2012 by Professor Claire Finkelstein, Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and by William Craven, Chairman of Federal Systems and the Center's first Executive Board Chair, principally as a direct response to the interrogation policies and abuses in the post-9/11 era, including at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib Prison. The central mission of CERL is to protect and promote rule of law values and ethical principles in the face of international challenges such as conflict with violent non-state actors, (seemingly) irrational and dangerous enemies, and transnational security risks. Its primary means of accomplishing this is to foster an exchange of ideas among academics, analysts, and practitioners regarding the interplay of rule of law/ethics and national and international security matters; to share the products of those discussions through published volumes or in open forums to raise public consciousness; and to prepare briefing papers and otherwise disseminate its views to educate policymakers as well as to impact public discussion. Much of CERL's work to date has revolved around setting up two annual roundtable, interdisciplinary conferences that bring together scholars and practitioners to consult on critical global issues relating to national or international security and the rule of law. Articles authored for the conference are then compiled with other writings into published volumes by Oxford University Press. CERL's event topics have been wide-ranging and included The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons Systems (November 2014), Preventing and Treating the Invisible Wounds of War: Combat Trauma and Psychological Injury (December 2015), The Ethics of Negotiation in Armed Conflict (April 2016), Using Law to Fight Terror: Legal Approaches to Combating Violent Non- State Actors (September 2016), Preserving Art and Culture in Times of War (April 2017), and Foreign Interference with Democratic Institutions (April 2017). Events are generally held at Penn Law School, but sometimes at other Philadelphia-area venues, such as the National Constitution Center, the Penn Museum, and the Perry World House. Notable speakers or participants at these events have included: General James \\"Hoss\\" Cartwright (a Four-Star General who served as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from August 2007 to August 2011), Dr. Haleh Esfandiari (the Iranian-American Founding Director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Middle East Program), Ambassador Dennis Ross (Director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff under President George W. Bush and Special Middle East Coordinator under President Bill Clinton), Irina Bokova (Bulgarian Director-General of UNESCO from 2009-2017), David Sanger (Chief White House Correspondent for The New York Times), and General Michael Hayden (former Director of the CIA and Director of the NSA). CERL publications include: Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World (OUP, April 2012), Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts (OUP, May 2015), and Weighing Lives in War (OUP, October 2017). Several others are forthcoming based on prior CERL conferences: Sovereignty and the New Executive Authority, Ethical Dilemmas in the Global Defense Industry, The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons Systems, Preventing and Treating the Invisible Wounds of War: Combat Trauma and Psychological Injury, and The Ethics of Negotiation in Armed Conflict. CERL also issued its first policy briefing paper in January 2017, entitled, \\"The Intersection of Opioid Usage and Veteran Mental Health Challenges.\\" CERL's non-fiduciary Executive Board consists of a high-level mix of former U.S. government officials, law professors, philosophy professors, businesspersons, and practicing lawyers. The current Chair of the Executive Board is Paul G. Haaga, Jr., formerly the Chairman of the Board, Capital Research and Management Company and Vice Chair of National Public Radio (NPR). CERL also benefits from advisory input from a roster of experts drawn from the ranks of academia, the military, legal practice, and business, including Vijay Kumar, Dean of the Penn Engineering School; Stuart Diamond, author of a best-selling book on negotiations; and Jeff McMahan, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford. In March 2017, CERL hired its inaugural Executive Director, David A. Sadoff, who formerly served as Deputy Legal Adviser and Director for Intelligence Reform at the National Security Council (NSC), Assistant General Counsel at the CIA, and General Counsel to the International Development Law Organization (IDLO). CERL is a not-for-profit that is supported financially by individual donors, corporations, foundations, other centers, institutes, and programs on and off the Penn campus, and by the Penn Law School and the University of Pennsylvania's Office of the Provost.

It is the analogous bend form of the butterfly loop, in that it is the butterfly loop with the loop cut. The observation that the butterfly loop is secure enough to isolate a worn or damaged section of rope within the loop indicated that the bend form of the knot would be similarly secure. History When Phil D. Smith made the first known presentation of the Hunter's bend in 1953 (under the name \\"rigger's bend\\"), he described it as a modification to the butterfly bend. While the bend form had been known to mountaineers, nautical rigger Brion Toss brought the knot to a wider audience when he published it in 1975. Unaware of the earlier publication, Toss called the butterfly bend the strait bend after the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Tying The butterfly bend can be tied using a subset of the methods used for tying the loop form by holding the two rope ends together and treating them as if they were a single bight. However, specific methods have been developed for tying the bend form directly, including the one shown below and characterizable using the mnemonic device \\"A d through a b; 'twixt the two and toward me\\": butterfly bend step by step Security A properly tied butterfly bend should be as secure as the equivalent loop form. However, subtle positioning errors during the above shown tying method can result in a similar looking but insecure bend knot.

It gains its name by often being used for binding the meat of the same name while it is being cooked. Since corned beef shrinks during cooking, the knot needs to be tightened several times during the process. Tying A buntline hitch is tied to the standing part and moderately tightened. The binding itself is tightened as the meat cooks by sliding the buntline hitch on the standing part. The knot is finished by a half hitch around the working end only after the meat has fully shrunk. It is considered more secure and suitable for this task than the related packer's knot.Clifford W. Ashley, The Ashley Book of Knots (New York: Doubleday, 1944), 37-38.

The knot is commonly taught to Guides and Scouts, and those in similar organizations as a basic binding knot. Tying and variations A lightly tightened figure-eight knot is formed around the standing part of the line such that both ends emerge from the same point. Pulling on the standing part tightens the binding. After the desired degree of tension is reached, a locking half-hitch is added over the working end and pulled taut. Even without the locking half-hitch the knot will generally maintain tension while additional tying is accomplished, such as putting a second, perpendicular, wrap on a package.Ashley(1944), p. 337Gordon Perry, Knots (North Vancouver, Canada: Quantum Publishing, 2006), 130-131. A similar knot made with an overhand knot instead of a figure-eight works almost as well.Des Pawson, Pocket Guide to Knots & Splices (Edison, NJ: Chartwell Books, Inc., 2002), 108-109. Many other variations also exist finishing with this style of locking half-hitch.

Secure while tension is maintained, it is easily untied even after heavy loading. The timber hitch is a very old knot. It is first known to have been mentioned in a nautical source c. 1625 and illustrated in 1762. Usage As the name suggests, this knot is often used by lumbermen and arborists for attaching ropes or chains to tree trunks, branches, and logs.Ashley (1944), p. 77 For stability when towing or lowering long items, the addition of a half-hitch in front of the timber hitch creates a timber hitch and a half hitch, or known as a killick hitch when at sea. A killick is \\"a small anchor or weight for mooring a boat, sometimes consisting of a stone secured by pieces of wood\\". This can also prevent the timber hitch from rolling. The timber hitch is one of the few knots that can easily be tied in a chain, leading to its use in applications where ropes lack the necessary strength and would break under the same amount of tension. This knot is also known as the Bowyer's Knot, as it is used to attach the lower end of the bowstring to the bottom limb on an English longbow. The hitch is also one of the methods used to connect ukulele and classical guitar strings to the bridge of the instruments. File:Zimmermannsknoten.jpgTimber hitch on a tree trunk. File:Classical_Guitar_Bridge_Bone.jpgTimber hitches on the bridge of a classical guitar Tying To make the knot, pass the rope completely around the object. Pass the running end around the standing part, then through the loop just formed. Make three or more turns (or twists) around the working part. Pull on the standing part to tighten around the object. A common error in tying can be avoided by assuring that the turns are made in the working part around itself. When making the hitch in laid rope, the turns should be made with the lay of the rope, that is, in the same direction as the twist of the rope. File:Timber Hitch HowTo.jpgTimber hitch step by step. Three turns are shown. File:Corde_chitarra_classica.jpgTying technique for stringed instruments Security Although The Ashley Book of Knots states that \\"three tucks or turns are ample\\", this work was written prior to the wide use of synthetic fiber cordage.

Along with his work as a solo artist, he has been a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band since 1984, a member of Crazy Horse, and founder/frontman of the band Grin. Lofgren was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band in 2014. Biography =Early life and career= Lofgren was born in Chicago in 1951 to an Italian mother and a Swedish father. When he was a young child, the family moved to the Washington, D.C., suburb of Bethesda, Maryland. Lofgren's first instrument was classical accordion, beginning at age five, which he studied seriously for ten years. After studying classical music and jazz, throughout his youth, Lofgren switched his emphasis to rock music, and focused on the piano and the guitar. Lofgren had been a competitive gymnast in high school, a skill that was used on stage later in his performing career and reflected in the name of his 1985 album, Flip. By 1968, Lofgren had formed the band Grin with bassist George Daly (later replaced by Bob Gordon), and drummer Bob Berberich, former players in the DC band The Hangmen. The group played in venues throughout the Washington, D.C., area. During this time, Lofgren met Neil Young while Young was performing at the Georgetown club The Cellar Door, and began a long association. Young invited Lofgren to come to California and the Grin trio (Lofgren, Daly and Berberich) drove out west and lived for some months at a home Neil Young rented in Laurel Canyon. Lofgren joined Young's band at age 19, playing piano and guitar on the album After the Gold Rush. Lofgren maintained a close musical relationship with Young, appearing on his Tonight's the Night album and tour among others. He has also been a recurring member of Crazy Horse (1970‚Äì1971; 1973; 2018‚Äìpresent), appearing on their 1971 LP and contributing songs to their catalogue. =Grin= Lofgren used the Neil Young album credits to land Grin a record deal in 1971. Daly left the band early on to become a Columbia Records A&R; Executive and was replaced by bassist Bob Gordon, who remained through the release of four critically acclaimed albums of catchy, hard rock, from 1971 to 1974, with guitar as Lofgren's primary instrument. The single \\"White Lies\\" got heavy airplay on Washington, D.C.-area radio. Lofgren wrote the majority of the group's songs, and often shared vocal duties with other members of the band (primarily drummer Bob Berberich). After the second album Nils added brother Tom Lofgren as a rhythm guitarist. Grin failed to hit the big time, and were released by their record company. =Solo career, part I= Grin disbanded in 1974. Lofgren's eponymous debut solo album was a success with critics; a 1975 Rolling Stone review by Jon Landau labeled it one of the finest rock albums of the year, and NME ranked it fifth on its list of albums of the year. Subsequent albums did not always garner critical favor, although Cry Tough was voted number 10 in the 1976 NME Album round up; I Came to Dance in particular received a scathing review in the New Rolling Stone Record Guide. He achieved progressive rock radio hits in the mid-1970s with \\"Back It Up\\", \\"Keith Don't Go\\" and \\"I Came to Dance\\". His song \\"Bullets Fever\\", about the 1978 NBA champion Washington Bullets, would become a favorite in the Washington area. Throughout the 1970s, Lofgren released solo albums and toured extensively with a backing band that usually included brother Tom on rhythm guitar. Lofgren's concerts displayed his reputation for theatrics, such as playing guitar while doing flips on a trampoline. In 1971 he appeared on stage on the Roy Buchanan Special, PBS TV, with Bill Graham. In 1973 he appeared with Grin on NBC on Midnight Special, performing three songs live. In 1978 he wrote and sang the \\"Nobody Bothers Me\\" theme for a D.C. Jhoon Rhee Tae Kwon Do advertisement, and also appeared in the ill-received Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie. Lofgren is credited on two of Lou Gramm's (of Foreigner) solo albums: Ready or Not released in 1987 (Lofgren listed as lead guitarist) and \\"Long Hard Look\\" released in 1989 (Nils listed as one of the guitarists). In 1987 he contributed the TV Show theme arrangement for Hunter. In 1993 he contributed to The Simpsons, with two Christmas jingles with Bart. In 1995 he appeared on a PBS tribute to the Beatles along with Dr. John. From 1991 to 1995 he was the CableAce Awards musical director and composer. =E Street Band= Print ad for Southside Johnny rock concert featuring Lofgren as guest In 1984, he joined Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band as the replacement for Steven Van Zandt on guitar and vocals, in time for Springsteen's massive Born in the U.S.A. Tour. Following the tour he appeared on Late Night with David Letterman, to promote his 1985 solo release Flip. The E Street Band toured again with Springsteen in 1988 on the Tunnel of Love Express and Human Rights Now!. In 1989 Springsteen broke up the E Street Band, but Lofgren and Van Zandt rejoined when Springsteen revived the band in 1999 for their Reunion Tour, followed by The Rising and another massive tour in 2002 and 2003, then again for the Magic album and world tour of 2007/2008, and most recently in 2012‚Äì2013 for the Wrecking Ball Tour and in 2014 for the High Hopes Tour.

Many of the people he worked with on those tours appeared on his 1991 album, Silver Lining. During the 2000s he got his own \\"Nils Lofgren Day\\" in Montgomery County, Maryland (August 25). In 2006 Lofgren released Sacred Weapon, featuring guest appearances by David Crosby, Graham Nash, Willie Nelson and Martin Sexton. In 2006 he recorded a live DVD Nils Lofgren & Friends: Acoustic Live at the Legendary Birchmere Music Hall in Alexandria, Virginia. On June 23, 2006, Lofgren performed at a benefit concert for Arthur Lee at New York's Beacon Theater, along with Robert Plant, Ian Hunter, Yo La Tengo and Garland Jeffreys. In 2007, he appeared playing guitar as part of Jerry Lee Lewis' backing band for Lewis' Last Man Standing Live concert DVD. He released The Loner ‚Äì Nils Sings Neil, an album of acoustic covers of Neil Young songs, in 2008. In September 2008, Lofgren had hip replacement surgery for both of his hips as a result of years of playing basketball, \\"performance 'flips' on stage, and age.\\" In August 2014, a box set, Face the Music, was released on the Fantasy label. The career-spanning retrospective contains nine CD's and a DVD covering 45 years. In December 2018 PBS NewsHour aired a 10-minute career retrospective Nils Lofgren: 50 years of ‚Äòjust being a guy in the band‚Äô. =Other work= Novelist Clive Cussler lives close to Lofgren's Arizona home, and collaborated on a song with him titled \\"What Ever Happened to Muscatel?\\" On August 17, 2017 Lofgren was inducted into the Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame. In May 2018, Lofgren replaced Frank Sampedro in Crazy Horse for their reunion concerts with Neil Young. =Material loss= On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Lofgren among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

The company is best known for its desktop page layout and design software, QuarkXPress, although this has now become secondary to its other products and services. History Quark was founded with $2,000 in 1981 in Denver, Colorado, USA. Between 1981 and 1985 their primary products were Word Juggler and Catalyst. Word Juggler was the first word processor on the Apple III. Catalyst was a program that was distributed bundled with the Apple IIe, and allowed users to run floppy disk- based applications from their hard drive. They also attempted a product line called \\"Quark Peripherals\\", but the market for storage devices at the time resulted in a huge financial loss. In March 1987 Quark released QuarkXPress 1.0, which due to its precision quickly gained market share from Aldus PageMaker. With the release of QuarkXPress 3.0 in 1990, Quark quickly achieved a dominant position in the desktop publishing market and became the standard for desktop publishing. By the end of the 1990s they gathered a market share of around 90%. In the late 1990s, Quark faced intense criticism for slow innovation cycles, high prices, and a poor response to customer needs. Therefore, many customers welcomed the release of Adobe InDesign in 1999 as a viable alternative. The release of Adobe Creative Suite in 2003, essentially including InDesign with Photoshop and Illustrator, resulted in ongoing market share loss for QuarkXPress. As a result, under the new leadership of Raymond Schiavone, Quark started to refocus its resources towards the enterprise dynamic publishing market (now Content Automation), announcing a new strategy in March 2008. =Ownership and management= Quark was founded under the name \\"Quark Engineering\\" 1981 by Tim Gill and Mark Pope. In 1986 Fred Ebrahimi joined Quark as CEO and co-owner. In 1990, Mark Pope sold his share of the company to the other partners. In 2000 Tim Gill left Quark and sold all his shares to Ebrahimi. In keeping with its India focus, Quark appointed Kamar Aulakh, a Quark veteran of Indian origin, as its CEO in February, 2004. In June 2005, Quark informed its employees that Aulakh was no longer with the company. At the end of 2006 Fred Ebrahimi gave all his shares of Quark Inc. to his children, with his daughter Sasha Ebrahimi taking the position of chairman. On November 1, 2006, Quark appointed Raymond Schiavone, former CEO of Arbortext, as its new CEO. On August 9, 2011, the Ebrahimi family sold all their shares to Platinum Equity, a California-based private equity firm. Parallax Capital Partners subsequently acquired Quark Software Inc. from Platinum Equity on July 12, 2017, stating their intentions to invest in growing the company's new content automation business through organic growth and acquisitions. Products Quark's first products were word processing software for the Apple II and Apple III. In 1987 it released its best known product, QuarkXPress, for Apple Macintosh. In 1992 it also released the product for Microsoft Windows. In the 1990s QuarkXPress 3.x gained around 90% market share of page layout applications. Its editorial workflow system, called Quark Publishing System, sold almost a thousand times to magazines and newspapers. The company announced a picture editing application, QuarkXPosure, which was never released, and a multimedia authoring add-on XTension for QuarkXPress, QuarkImmedia. Neither is part of Quark's portfolio anymore. The company briefly purchased and marketed a standalone multimedia authoring program, mTropolis, before discontinuing it in the late 1990s. Quark acquired two companies creating add-ons for QuarkXPress and InDesign, in 2005 alap and in 2010 Gluon. In March 2008, Quark announced a new direction. Quark acquired an XML editor vendor in 2008, a company called in.vision research. On May 29, 2012 Quark acquired Mobile IQ, with digital publishing technology for tablet devices named PressRun, later renamed to App Studio. Reflecting a shift towards Web-based word-processing tools such as Office 365 and Google Docs, in November 2014, Quark announced the release of a new authoring tool, Quark Author. In November 2017, Quark announced the acquisition of New York based company, Docurated. Docurated develops a Cloud Sales Enablement Platform to enable sales teams to rapidly access and share sales content with their prospects.

Most notable are several books describing crank mathematics by people who think they have squared the circle or done other impossible things. These books, which alternate between appreciation and exasperation, include The Trisectors (MAA 1996, ), Mathematical Cranks (MAA 1992, ), and Numerology: Or, What Pythagoras Wrought (MAA 1997, ). They helped him win the Trevor Evans Award for expository writing from the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in 1996. Dudley has also written and edited straightforward mathematical works such as Readings for Calculus (MAA 1993, ) and Elementary Number Theory (W.H. Freeman 1978, ). He is the discoverer of the Dudley triangle. Dudley is a native of New York City. He received bachelor's and master's degrees from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. His academic career consisted of two years at Ohio State University followed by thirty-seven at DePauw University, from which he retired in 2004. He has edited the College Mathematics Journal and the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal, and was a P√≥lya Lecturer for the MAA for two years.  Lawsuit  In 1995, Dudley was one of several people sued by William Dilworth for defamation because Mathematical Cranks included an analysis of Dilworth's \\"A correction in set theory\\", an attempted refutation of Cantor's diagonal method. The suit was dismissed in 1996 due to failure to state a claim. The dismissal was upheld on appeal in a decision written by Richard Posner. From the decision: \\"A crank is a person inexplicably obsessed by an obviously unsound idea‚Äîa person with a bee in his bonnet. To call a person a crank is to say that because of some quirk of temperament he is wasting his time pursuing a line of thought that is plainly without merit or promise ... To call a person a crank is basically just a colorful and insulting way of expressing disagreement with his master idea, and it therefore belongs to the language of controversy rather than to the language of defamation.\\"Caselaw: United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, ruling on Dillworth vs. Dudley, 1996  See also  * Pseudomathematics  References  External links  DePauw University News story on Underwood Dudley and his \\"crank file\\"\\" (with photo) * Review of Hans Walser's The Golden Section by Underwood Dudley 1937 births Living people 20th-century American mathematicians 21st-century American mathematicians American folklorists Carnegie Mellon University alumni University of Michigan alumni DePauw University faculty Ohio State University alumni Pseudomathematics ","title":"Underwood Dudley"},{"id":"176422","title":"Thomas Warton"},{"id":"176423","title":"Flag of Norway"},{"id":"176424","text":"Example of a galvanic anode on the hull of a ship.A galvanic anode, or sacrificial anode, is the main component of a galvanic cathodic protection (CP) system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion. They are made from a metal alloy with a more \\"active\\" voltage (more negative reduction potential / more positive electrochemical potential) than the metal of the structure. The difference in potential between the two metals means that the galvanic anode corrodes, so that the anode material is consumed in preference to the structure. The loss (or sacrifice) of the anode material gives rise to the alternative name of sacrificial anode. Theory In brief, corrosion is a chemical reaction occurring by an electrochemical mechanism (a redox reaction).Shrier 10:4 During corrosion there are two reactions, oxidation (equation ), where electrons leave the metal (and results in the actual loss of metal) and reduction, where the electrons are used to convert water or oxygen to hydroxides (equations and ).Peabody p.2 In most environments, the hydroxide ions and ferrous ions combine to form ferrous hydroxide, which eventually becomes the familiar brown rust:Shrier 3:4 As corrosion takes place, oxidation and reduction reactions occur and electrochemical cells are formed on the surface of the metal so that some areas will become anodic (oxidation) and some cathodic (reduction). Electrons flow from the anodic areas into the electrolyte as the metal corrodes. Conversely, as electrons flow from the electrolyte to the cathodic areas the rate of corrosion is reduced.Peabody p.21 (The flow of electrons is in the opposite direction of the flow of electric current). As the metal continues to corrode, the local potentials on the surface of the metal will change and the anodic and cathodic areas will change and move. As a result, in ferrous metals, a general covering of rust is formed over the whole surface, which will eventually consume all the metal. This is rather a simplified view of the corrosion process, because it can occur in several different forms.Shrier 1:2 CP works by introducing another metal (the galvanic anode) with a much more anodic surface, so that all the current will flow from the introduced anode and the metal to be protected becomes cathodic in comparison to the anode. This effectively stops the oxidation reactions on the metal surface by transferring them to the galvanic anode, which will be sacrificed in favour of the structure under protection.Shrier 10:29 For this to work there must be an electron pathway between the anode and the metal to be protected (e.g., a wire or direct contact) and an ion pathway between both the oxidizing agent (e.g., water or moist soil) and the anode, and the oxidizing agent and the metal to be protected, thus forming a closed circuit; therefore simply bolting a piece of active metal such as zinc to a less active metal, such as mild steel, in air (a poor conductor and therefore no closed circuit) will not furnish any protection. Anode materials A steel wide-beam canal barge, showing a newly-blacked hull and new magnesium anodes. There are three main metals used as galvanic anodes, magnesium, aluminum and zinc. They are all available as blocks, rods, plates or extruded ribbon. Each material has advantages and disadvantages. Magnesium has the most negative electropotential of the three (see galvanic series) and is more suitable for areas where the electrolyte (soil or water) resistivity is higher. This is usually on-shore pipelines and other buried structures, although it is also used on boats in fresh water and in water heaters. In some cases, the negative potential of magnesium can be a disadvantage: if the potential of the protected metal becomes too negative, hydrogen ions may be evolved on the cathode surface leading to hydrogen embrittlement or to disbonding of the coating.Peabody p.37Schreir 10:44 Where this is a possibility, zinc anodes may be used. Zinc and aluminium are generally used in salt water, where the resistivity is generally lower. Typical uses are for the hulls of ships and boats, offshore pipelines and production platforms, in salt-water-cooled marine engines, on small boat propellers and rudders, and for the internal surface of storage tanks. Zinc is considered a reliable material, but is not suitable for use at higher temperatures, as it tends to passivate (the oxide formed shields from further oxidation); if this happens, current may cease to flow and the anode stops working.Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz p.185 Zinc has a relatively low driving voltage, which means in higher-resistivity soils or water it may not be able to provide sufficient current. However, in some circumstances -- where there is a risk of hydrogen embrittlement, for example -- this lower voltage is advantageous, as overprotection is avoided.Shreir 10:43 Aluminium anodes have several advantages, such as a lighter weight, and much higher capacity than zinc. However, their electrochemical behavior is not considered as reliable as zinc, and greater care must be taken in how they are used. Aluminium anodes will passivate where chloride concentration is below 1,446 parts per million. One disadvantage of aluminium is that if it strikes a rusty surface, a large thermite spark may be generated, so its use is restricted in tanks where there may be explosive atmospheres and there is a risk of the anode falling. Since the operation of a galvanic anode relies on the difference in electropotential between the anode and the cathode, practically any metal can be used to protect some other, providing there is a sufficient difference in potential. For example, iron anodes can be used to protect copper.Shreir 10:12 Design considerations The design of a galvanic anode CP system should consider many factors, including the type of structure, the resistivity of the electrolyte (soil or water) it will operate in, the type of coating and the service life. The primary calculation is how much anode material will be required to protect the structure for the required time. Too little material may provide protection for a while, but need to be replaced regularly. Too much material would provide protection at an unnecessary cost. The mass in kg is given by equation ().DNV RP-B401-2005 * The design life is in years (1 year = 8760 hours). * The utilisation factor (UF) of the anode is a constant value, depending on the shape of the anode and how it is attached, which signifies how much of the anode can be consumed before it ceases to be effective. A value of 0.8 indicates that 80% of the anode can be consumed, before it should be replaced. A long slender stand off anode (installed on legs to keep the anode away from the structure) has a UF value of 0.9, whereas the UF of a short, flush mounted anode is 0.8. * Anode capacity is an indication of how much material is consumed as current flows over time. The value for zinc in seawater is 780 Ah/kg but aluminium is 2000 Ah/kg, which means that, in theory, aluminium can produce much more current than zinc before being depleted and this is one of the factors to consider when choosing a particular material. The amount of current required corresponds directly to the surface area of the metal exposed to the soil or water, so the application of a coating drastically reduces the mass of anode material required. The better the coating, the less anode material is needed. Once the mass of material is known, the particular type of anode is chosen. Differently shaped anodes will have a different resistance to earth, which governs how much current can be produced, so the resistance of the anode is calculated to ensure that sufficient current will be available. If the resistance of the anode is too high, either a differently shaped or sized anode is chosen, or a greater quantity of anodes must be used. The arrangement of the anodes is then planned so as to provide an even distribution of current over the whole structure. For example, if a particular design shows that a pipeline long needs 10 anodes, then approximately one anode per kilometre would be more effective than putting all 10 anodes at one end or in the centre. Advantages and disadvantages of galvanic anode protection =Advantages= * No external power sources required. * Relatively easy to install. * Lower voltages and current mean that risk of causing stray current interference on other structures is low. * Require less frequent monitoring than impressed current CP systems. * Relatively low risk of overprotection. * Once installed, testing the system components is relatively simple for trained personnel. =Disadvantages= * Current capacity limited by anode mass and self consumption at low current density. * Lower driving voltage means the anodes may not work in high-resistivity environments. * Often require that structure be electrically isolated from other structures and ground. * Anodes are heavy and will increase water resistance on moving structures or pipe interiors. * Where D.C. power is available, electrical energy can be obtained more cheaply than by galvanic anodes. * Where large arrays are used wiring is needed due to high current flow and need to keep resistance losses low. * Anodes must be carefully placed to avoid interfering with water flow into the propeller. * To retain effectiveness, the anodes must be inspected and/or replaced as part of normal maintenance. Cost effectiveness As the anode materials used are generally more costly than iron, using this method to protect ferrous metal structures may not appear to be particularly cost effective. However, consideration should also be given to the costs incurred to repair a corroded hull or to replace a steel pipeline or tank because their structural integrity has been compromised by corrosion. However, there is a limit to the cost effectiveness of a galvanic system. On larger structures, or long pipelines, so many anodes may be needed that it would be more cost-effective to install impressed current cathodic protection. Production of sacrificial anodes The basic method is to produce sacrificial anodes through a casting process. However, two casting methods can be distinguished. Quality aspects in the production of sacrificial anodes https://opferanode24.de/en/interesting-facts/ The high pressure die-casting process for sacrificial anodes is widespread. It is a fully automated machine process. In order for the manufacturing process to run reliably and in a repeatable manner, a modification of the processed sacrificial anode alloy is required. Alternatively, the gravity casting process is used for the production of the sacrificial anodes. This process is performed manually or partially automated. The alloy does not have to be adapted to the manufacturing process, but is designed for 100% optimum corrosion protection. See also * Galvanic corrosion Notes References * A.W.

Biography Martignac was born in Bordeaux, France. In 1798 he became secretary to Emmanuel Joseph Siey√®s; after serving for a while in the army, he turned to literature, producing several light plays. Under the Empire he practised with success as an advocate at Bordeaux, where in 1818 he became advocate-general of the cour royale. In 1819 he was appointed procureur-g√©n√©ral at Limoges, and in 1821 was returned for Marmande to the Chamber of Deputies, where he supported the ultraroyalist policies of Vill√®le. In 1822 he was appointed councillor of state, in 1823 he accompanied the duc d'Angoul√©me to Spain as civil commissary; in 1824 he was created a viscount and appointed director-general of registration. This cites E. Daudet, Le Minist√®re de M. de Martignac (Paris, 1875). In contact with practical politics his ultra-royalist views were gradually modified in the direction of the Doctrinaires, and on the fall of Vill√®le he was selected by Charles X to carry out the new policy of compromise. On 4 January 1828 he was appointed minister of the interior, and, though not bearing the title of president, became the virtual head of the cabinet. He succeeded in passing the act abolishing the press censorship, and in persuading the king to sign the ordinances of 16 June 1828 on the Jesuits and the little seminaries. He was exposed to attack from both the extreme left and the extreme right, and when in April 1829 a coalition of these groups defeated him in the chamber, Charles X, who had never believed in the policy he represented, replaced him by the prince de Polignac. In March 1830 Martignac voted with the majority for the address protesting against the famous ordinances; but during the revolution that followed he remained true to his legitimist principles. His last public appearance was in defence of Polignac in the Chamber of Peers in December 1830.

The book of dogs; an intimate study of mankind's best friend, 1919. Terrier (from the French word terrier , meaning \\"burrow\\") is a type of dog originally bred to hunt vermin. A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of the terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, game, and fearless. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over 32 kg (71 lb) and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups of Terrier, with each group having different shapes and sizes.  History  A painting of an English toy terrier by Frederick August Wenderoth in 1865 Most terrier breeds were refined from the older purpose-bred dogs. The gameness of the early hunting terriers was exploited by using them in sporting contests. Initially, terriers competed in events such as clearing a pit of rats. The dog that was fastest in killing all the rats won. In the eighteenth century some terriers were crossed with hounds to improve their hunting, and some with fighting dog breeds to \\"intensify tenacity and increase courage\\". Some of the crosses with fighting dogs, bull and terrier crosses, were used in the blood sport of dog-fighting. Modern pet breeds such as the Miniature Bull Terrier are listed by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) under Bull type terriers. Today, most terriers are kept as companion dogs and family pets. They are generally loyal and affectionate to their owners. Terrier types and groups In the 18th century in Britain, only two types of terriers were recognized, long- and short-legged. Today, terriers are often informally categorized by size or by function. Hunting-types are still used to find, track, or trail quarry, especially underground, and sometimes to bolt the quarry. Modern examples include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Jagdterrier, the Rat Terrier, Dobermann and the Patterdale Terrier. There are also the short-legged terriers such as the Cairn Terrier, the Scottish Terrier, and the West Highland White Terrier, which were also used to kill small vermin. The original hunting terriers include the Fell Terrier (developed in northern England to assist in the killing of foxes) and the Hunt Terrier (developed in southern England to locate, kill or bolt foxes during a traditional mounted fox hunt). The various combinations of bulldog and terrier that were used for bull-baiting and dog-fighting in the late 19th century were later refined into separate breeds that combined both terrier and bulldog qualities. Except for the Boston Terrier, they are generally included in kennel clubs' Terrier Group. Breeders have bred modern bull-type terrier breeds, such as the Bull Terrier and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, into suitable family dogs and show terriers. Toy terriers have been bred from larger terriers and are shown in the Toy or Companion group. Included among these breeds are the English Toy Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. While small, they retain true terrier character and are not submissive \\"lap dogs\\". Other descendants of the bull and terrier types, such as the Asian Gull Terrier, are among the dogs still raised for illegal dog-fighting. = Appearance = Terriers range greatly in appearance from very small, light bodied, smooth coated dogs such as the English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan), which weighs as little as , to the very large rough-coated Airedale Terriers, which can be up to or more. As of 2004, the United Kennel Club recognized a new hairless breed of terrier derived from the Rat Terrier called the American Hairless Terrier. Kennel club classification When competing in conformation shows, most kennel clubs including the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale group pedigree terrier breeds together in their own terrier group.

The theory applies only for evolution at the molecular level, and is compatible with phenotypic evolution being shaped by natural selection as postulated by Charles Darwin. The neutral theory allows for the possibility that most mutations are deleterious, but holds that because these are rapidly removed by natural selection, they do not make significant contributions to variation within and between species at the molecular level. A neutral mutation is one that does not affect an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. The neutral theory assumes that most mutations that are not deleterious are neutral rather than beneficial. Because only a fraction of gametes are sampled in each generation of a species, the neutral theory suggests that a mutant allele can arise within a population and reach fixation by chance, rather than by selective advantage. The theory was introduced by the Japanese biologist Motoo Kimura in 1968, and independently by two American biologists Jack Lester King and Thomas Hughes Jukes in 1969, and described in detail by Kimura in his 1983 monograph The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. The proposal of the neutral theory was followed by an extensive \\"neutralist-selectionist\\" controversy over the interpretation of patterns of molecular divergence and gene polymorphism, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s. Origins While some scientists, such as Freese (1962) and Freese and Yoshida (1965), had suggested that neutral mutations were probably widespread, a coherent theory of neutral evolution was proposed by Motoo Kimura in 1968, and by King and Jukes independently in 1969. Kimura initially focused on differences among species, King and Jukes on differences within species. Many molecular biologists and population geneticists also contributed to the development of the neutral theory. Principles of population genetics, established by J.B.S. Haldane, R.A. Fisher and Sewall Wright, created a mathematical approach to analyzing gene frequencies that contributed to the development of Kimura's theory. Haldane's dilemma regarding the cost of selection was used as motivation by Kimura. Haldane estimated that it takes about 300 generations for a beneficial mutation to become fixed in a mammalian lineage, meaning that the number of substitutions (1.5 per year) in the evolution between humans and chimpanzees was too high to be explained by beneficial mutations.  Functional constraint  The neutral theory holds that as functional constraint diminishes, the probability that a mutation is neutral rises, and so should the rate of sequence divergence. When comparing various proteins, extremely high evolutionary rates were observed in proteins such as fibrinopeptides and the C chain of the proinsulin molecule, which both have little to no functionality compared to their active molecules. Kimura and Ohta also estimated that the alpha and beta chains on the surface of a hemoglobin protein evolve at a rate almost ten times faster than the inside pockets, which would imply that the overall molecular structure of hemoglobin is less significant than the inside where the iron-containing heme groups reside. There is evidence that rates of nucleotide substitution are particularly high in the third position of a codon, where there is little functional constraint. This view is based in part on the degenerate genetic code, in which sequences of three nucleotides (codons) may differ and yet encode the same amino acid (GCC and GCA both encode alanine, for example). Consequently, many potential single-nucleotide changes are in effect \\"silent\\" or \\"unexpressed\\" (see synonymous or silent substitution). Such changes are presumed to have little or no biological effect.  Quantitative theory  Kimura also developed the infinite sites model (ISM) to provide insight into evolutionary rates of mutant alleles. If v were to represent the rate of mutation of gametes per generation of N individuals, each with two sets of chromosomes, the total number of new mutants in each generation is 2Nv. Now let k represent the evolution rate in terms of a mutant allele \\\\mu becoming fixed in a population. k=2Nv\\\\mu According to ISM, selectively neutral mutations appear at rate \\\\mu in each of the 2N copies of a gene, and fix with probability 1/(2N). Because any of the 2N genes have the ability to become fixed in a population, 1/2N is equal to \\\\mu, resulting in the rate of evolutionary rate equation: k=v This means that if all mutations were neutral, the rate at which fixed differences accumulate between divergent populations is predicted to be equal to the per-individual mutation rate, independent of population size. When the proportion of mutations that are neutral is constant, so is the divergence rate between populations. This provides a rationale for the molecular clock - which predated neutral theory. The ISM also demonstrates a constancy that is observed in molecular lineages. This stochastic process is assumed to obey equations describing random genetic drift by means of accidents of sampling, rather than for example genetic hitchhiking of a neutral allele due to genetic linkage with non-neutral alleles. After appearing by mutation, a neutral allele may become more common within the population via genetic drift. Usually, it will be lost, or in rare cases it may become fixed, meaning that the new allele becomes standard in the population. According to the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the amount of genetic variation within a species should be proportional to the effective population size. The \\"neutralist‚Äìselectionist\\" debate A heated debate arose when Kimura's theory was published, largely revolving around the relative percentages of polymorphic and fixed alleles that are \\"neutral\\" versus \\"non-neutral\\". A genetic polymorphism means that different forms of particular genes, and hence of the proteins that they produce, are co-existing within a species. Selectionists claimed that such polymorphisms are maintained by balancing selection, while neutralists view the variation of a protein as a transient phase of molecular evolution. Studies by Richard K. Koehn and W. F. Eanes demonstrated a correlation between polymorphism and molecular weight of their molecular subunits. This is consistent with the neutral theory assumption that larger subunits should have higher rates of neutral mutation. Selectionists, on the other hand, contribute environmental conditions to be the major determinants of polymorphisms rather than structural and functional factors. According to the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the amount of genetic variation within a species should be proportional to the effective population size. Levels of genetic diversity vary much less than census population sizes, giving rise to the \\"paradox of variation\\" . While high levels of genetic diversity were one of the original arguments in favor of neutral theory, the paradox of variation has been one of the strongest arguments against neutral theory. There are a large number of statistical methods for testing whether neutral theory is a good description of evolution (e.g., McDonald-Kreitman test), and many authors claimed detection of selection (Fay et al. 2002, Begun et al. 2007, Shapiro et al. 2007, Hahn 2008, Akey 2009, Kern 2018). Some researchers have nevertheless argued that the neutral theory still stands, while expanding the definition of neutral theory to include background selection at linked sites. Nearly neutral theory Tomoko Ohta also emphasized the importance of nearly neutral mutations, in particularly slightly deleterious mutations. The population dynamics of nearly neutral mutations are only slightly different from those of neutral mutations unless the absolute magnitude of the selection coefficient is greater than 1/N, where N is the effective population size in respect of selection. The value of N may therefore affect how many mutations can be treated as neutral and how many as deleterious.

It was established in East Germany as a brand for photographic film and magnetic tape, mainly produced at the former ORWO Filmfabrik Wolfen (now Chemical Park Bitterfeld-Wolfen). In 1909 the Filmfabrik Wolfen was founded as part of the Aktien-Gesellschaft f√ºr Anilin-Fabrikation (Agfa) and belonged to I.G. Farben since 1925. The Agfa Wolfen plant developed one of the first modern colour films, with incorporated colour couplers, Agfacolor, in 1936, one year after Kodachrome.  After World War II  On 20 April 1945, following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the plant was taken over by US forces and important patents and other documents regarding the Agfacolor process were confiscated and handed over to Western competitors, such as Kodak and Ilford. As the plant was located in what was to become the Soviet zone of occupied Germany, the US forces then handed it over to the Soviet military administration, which dismantled large parts of the plant and moved it, with key German staff, to the Soviet Union, where it formed the basis for the Soviet colour film industry.  ORWO in the GDR  In 1953 the plant became the property of East Germany, and in a trade agreement settlement, the East German company, VEB Film- und Chemiefaserwerk Agfa Wolfen, was given the right to sell its products under the Agfa brand in Eastern Europe, while the newly re-established Agfa in West German Leverkusen had the right to the name in the rest of the world. As the trade agreement seriously hampered the East German company's abilities to sell in the western countries, the ORWO trademark (patterned after ORiginal WOlfen) was introduced in 1964. After the formation of the Combine VEB Fotochemisches Kombinat Wolfen in 1970 the VEB ORWO Filmfabrik Wolfen became its headquarter. Founder members of the new Combine were Fotopapierwerke Dresden, Fotopapierwerke Wernigerode, Gelatinewerke Calbe, Fotochemische Werke Berlin and the Lichtpausenwerk Berlin. ORWO-branded 35mm colour slide film became available in the United Kingdom in the 1970s through magazine advertisements for mail order suppliers. It was a cheaper alternative to the mainstream brands available at the time. ORWO prepared the changeover from AgfaColor to C-41, similar to considerations in the USSR, but had not completed until the end of the GDR, which lead to decreasing sales figures in the western countries, where the Kodak C-41 process dominated the market.  After 1990  Following the merger of East Germany and West Germany, the company was privatized in 1990. After several bankruptcies, a number of companies are continuing the tradition of ORWO. These are the ORWO FilmoTec GmbH, ORWO Net AG (digital photo supplies), Organica Feinchemie GmbH Wolfen, FEW Chemicals GmbH, Folienwerk Wolfen GmbH ‚Äì all together suppliers for optical, electrical and film industry ‚Äì and further companies. The ORWO FilmoTec GmbH was formed in 1998, which continues to manufacture a reduced range of former ORWO products, including high quality, 16mm & 35mm, black and white, print stock, duplicate stock, sound stock, industrial films, cinematography films and photo films. In partnership with ORWO North America, ORWO film has expanded; ORWO N.A currently supplies all US Library of Congress black and white industrial films, in addition to high-profile archival clients like The Smithsonian and MOMA. For example, black-and-white movies that have been selected by the US Library of Congress for archival copy preservation in the last 5 years have been most likely reprocessed on to ORWO film. The cellulose triacetate base manufacturing plant of ORWO was sold to Island Pyrochemical Industries, Mineola, NY. The new company, located in the Chemical Park Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany, produces high quality TAC (triacetyl cellulose, aka cellulose triacetate) for the LCD polarizer market and the polarized sunglasses market. The ORWO trademark is used by ORWO Net AG and FilmTec GmbH for a variety of photographic products. The Industrie- und Filmmuseum Wolfen provides a permanent exhibition about the history of the Filmfabrik Wolfen and the ORWO products.

He dissects the aspects of weasel behavior and explores its benefits and ramifications, sometimes referring to his own life experiences. The book is divided up into many sections and chapters which show different types of weasels, how to be a weasel, weasel words, and methods for countering the weasels you may encounter in everyday life.

He is best known for his book Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth (1802), which summarised the work of James Hutton. It was through this book that Hutton's principle of uniformitarianism, later taken up by Charles Lyell, first reached a wide audience. Playfair's textbook Elements of Geometry made a brief expression of Euclid's parallel postulate known now as Playfair's axiom. In 1783 he was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He served as General Secretary to the society 1798‚Äì1819. Life Born at Benvie, slightly west of Dundee to Margaret Young (1719/20 ‚Äì 1805) and Reverend James Playfair (died 1772), the kirk minister of Liff and Benvie.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf Playfair was educated at home until the age of 14, when he entered the University of St Andrews to study divinity. He also did further studies at Edinburgh University. In 1766, when only 18, he was a candidate for the chair of mathematics in Marischal College (now part of the University of Aberdeen), and, although he was unsuccessful, his claims were admitted to be high. Six years later (1772) he applied for the chair of natural philosophy (physics) at St Andrews University, but again without success. In 1773 he was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland and was offered the united parishes of Liff and his home parish of Benvie (made vacant by the death of his father). However, Playfair chose to continue his studies in mathematics and physics, and in 1782 he resigned his charge to become the tutor of Adam Ferguson. By this arrangement Playfair regularly visited Edinburgh and went on to cultivate the literary and scientific society for which the city was at that time specially distinguished. In particular, he attended the natural history course of John Walker. Through Nevil Maskelyne, whose acquaintance he had first made in the course of the celebrated Schiehallion experiments in 1774, he also gained access to the scientific circles of London. In 1785 when Dugald Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the University of Edinburgh Chair of Moral Philosophy, Playfair succeeded the former to become the chair of mathematics. Sir John Playfair by Sir Francis Chantrey In 1795 Playfair published an alternative, more stringent formulation of Euclid's parallel postulate, which is now called Playfair's axiom. Although the axiom bears Playfair's name, he did not create it, but credited others, in particular William Ludlam with its prior use.J. Playfair and Euclid, Elements of geometry; containing the first six books of Euclid, with two books on the geometry of solids. To which are added, elements of plane and spherical trigonometry, J.B. Lippincott & Co, 1860, p. 291. Available online from Google Books. See also Cajori's A History of Mathematics. In 1802 Playfair published his celebrated volume entitled Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth. The influence exerted by James Hutton on the development of geology is thought to be largely due to its publication. In 1805 Playfair exchanged the Chair of Mathematics for that of natural philosophy in succession to John Robison, whom also he succeeded as general secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He took a prominent part, on the liberal side, in the ecclesiastical controversy that arose in connection with Sir John Leslie's appointment to the post he had vacated, and published a satirical letter (1806). He moved from 6 Buccleuch Place to a new house at 2 Albany Street (then called Albany Row) in 1807.Edinburgh Post Office Directories 1805 to 1810grant's Old and New Edinburgh vol III Playfair was an opponent of Gottfried Leibniz's vis viva principle, an early version of the conservation of energy.

Playfair, appeared at Edinburgh in 1822.See the Collected Works of John Playfair on the Internet Archive (www.archive.org) His writings include a number of essays contributed to the Edinburgh Review from 1804 onwards, various papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (including his earliest publication, \\"On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities\\", 1779, and an \\"Account of the Lithological Survey of Schehallion\\", 1811) and in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (\\"On the Causes which Affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements\\" and others), the articles \\"Aepinus\\" and \\"Physical Astronomy\\", and a \\"Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science since the Revival of Learning in Europe\\" in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (Supplement to fourth, fifth and sixth editions). He also took an interest in Indian astronomy and compared them with traditional and ancient astronomy from Egypt and Greece. He also examined Indian concepts in trigonometry. His Elements of Geometry first appeared in 1795 and has passed through many editions; his Outlines of Natural Philosophy (2 vols., 1812‚Äì1816) consist of the propositions and formulae which were the basis of his class lectures. Playfair's contributions to pure mathematics were not considerable, his papers \\"On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities\\" and \\"On the Causes which Affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements\\", and his Elements of Geometry, all already referred to, being the most important. His lives of Matthew Stewart, Hutton, and Robison, many of his reviews, and above all his \\"Dissertation\\" are of the utmost value.

S&M; participants at Pride London Folsom Street Fair float at San Francisco Pride, 2014 Leathermen at Cologne Pride, Germany 2014 The leather subculture denotes practices and styles of dress organized around sexual activities that involve leather garments, such as leather jackets, vests, boots, chaps, harnesses, or other items. Wearing leather garments is one way that participants in this culture self-consciously distinguish themselves from mainstream sexual cultures. Many participants associate leather culture with BDSM (Bondage/Discipline, Dominance/Submission, Sado/Masochism, also called \\"SM\\" or \\"S&M;\\") practices and its many subcultures. For some, black leather clothing is an erotic fashion that expresses heightened masculinity or the appropriation of sexual power; love of motorcycles, motorcycle clubs and independence; and/or engagement in sexual kink or leather fetishism.\\"Elegy for the Valley of Kings,\\" by Gayle Rubin, in In Changing Times: Gay Men and Lesbians Encounter HIV/AIDS, ed. Levine et al., University of Chicago Press History Male leather culture has existed since the late 1940s, when it likely grew out of post-WWII biker culture. Pioneering motorcycle clubs included the Satyrs Motorcycle Club, established in Los Angeles in 1954; Oedipus Motorcycle Club, also established in Los Angeles in 1958, and the New York Motorbike Club. Early San Francisco clubs included the Warlocks and the California Motor Club,Rubin, Gayle. \\"The Miracle Mile: South of Market and Leather, 1962‚Äì1997\\" in Reclaiming San Francisco: History, Politics, Culture (City Light Books, 1998) while early clubs in Sydney included the South Pacific Motor Club (SPMC). These clubs reflected a disaffection with the mainstream culture of post-World War II America, a disaffection whose notoriety ‚Äî and therefore appeal ‚Äî expanded after the sensationalized news coverage of the Hollister \\"riot\\" of 1947. The 1953 film The Wild One, starring Marlon Brando wearing jeans, a T-shirt, a leather jacket, and Muir cap, played on pop-cultural fascination with the Hollister \\"riot\\" and promoted an image of masculine independence that resonated with some men who were dissatisfied with mainstream culture. Some butch gays began to imitate Brando by wearing black leather jackets, a black leather cap, black leather boots and jeans and, if they could afford it, by also riding motorcycles. Motorcycle culture also reflected some men's disaffection with the cultures more organized around high culture, popular culture (especially musical theater), and/or camp style. As well, the leather community that emerged from the motorcycle clubs also became the practical and symbolic location for men's open exploration of kink and S&M.; The first gay leather bar in the United States, the Gold Coast, opened in Chicago in 1958, having been founded by Dom Orejudos and Chuck Renslow. South of Market in San Francisco became the hub of the leather subculture in the gay community in 1961 when the Tool Box opened its doors as the first leather bar in the neighborhood.Brook, J., Carlsson, C., and Peters, N. J. (1998). Reclaiming San Francisco: history, politics, culture. San Francisco: City Lights It opened in 1961 at 339 4th St and closed in 1971. It was a gay bar frequented by gay motorcycle clubs. It was made famous by the June 1964 Paul Welch Life article entitled \\"Homosexuality In America,\\" the first time a national publication reported on gay issues. Life 's photographer was referred to the Tool Box by Hal Call, who had long worked to dispel the myth that all homosexual men were effeminate. The article opened with a two-page spread of the mural of life size leathermen in the bar, which had been painted by Chuck Arnett in 1962. The article described San Francisco as \\"The Gay Capital of America\\" and inspired many gay leathermen to move there. When the Stud, along with Febe's, opened up on Folsom Street in San Francisco in 1966, other gay leather bars and establishments catering to the leather subculture followed creating a foundation for the growing gay leather community.Brook, J., Carlsson, C., and Peters, N.

In Gagnon, John H. and William Simon. New York: Harper & Row. The Stud was also originally a Hell's Angels hangout; by 1969 it had become a dance bar for hippies on the margins of the leather scene and had a psychedelic black light mural by Chuck Arnett. Leather clubs started in Sydney from 1970. Some bands have used leather culture as part of their image beginning in the 1970s; see ¬ß Representations below. Aspects of leather culture beyond the sartorial can be seen in the 1970 murder mystery novel Cruising, by Jay Green. The novel was the basis for the 1980 movie Cruising, which depicted aspects of the men's leather subculture for a wider audience. Drumner is an American magazine targeted at gay men, originally published from 1975 to 1999; during the late 20th century, it was the most successful of the American leather magazines, and sold overseas. The publication had a major impact of spreading gay leather as a lifestyle and masculinity as a gay ideal. The magazine was originally focused on quality writings about leatherDrummer magazine founder John Embry dies. Obituary in the Bay Area Reporter but gradually changed into more of a photo magazine.Gay leather magazines, cuirmale.nl In the 1970s Berlin had a huge leather scene with several leather clubs in the area around Nollendorfplatz. The pornographic films of one of Tom of Finland's models Peter Berlin from Berlin, such as his 1973 film Nights in Black Leather, also reflected and promoted the leather subcultural aesthetic. In 1975 Europe's biggest fetish event started, Easter in Berlin Leather Festival. Also in Europe younger men combined the aesthetic and exploration of sexual power with the gay skinhead movement and social-fraternal organizations like BLUF, from the late 1970s. Cynthia Slater's activism for women to be accepted within the gay leather scene in San Francisco during the late 1970s brought her to mainstream attention.\\"2014 Leather Hall of Fame Inductee Cynthia Slater (1945‚Äì1989)\\", Leather Hall of Fame Inductees List Call, Lewis. 2013. BDSM in American science fiction and fantasy. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. p.5 Slater persuaded the management of San Francisco's S/M leather club the Catacombs, the most famous fisting club in the world, to open up to lesbians; it was originally a gay men's club.Gayle Rubin, \\"The Catacombs: A Triumph of the Butthole\\", in Leatherfolk: Radical Sex, People, Politics, and Practice, Alyson Press, 1992, , pp. 119‚Äì141; reprinted in Deviations: A Gayle Rubin Reader, Duke University Press, 2011, , , retrieved September 30, 2014. It operated from 1975 to 1981, and reopened at another location from 1982 to 1984. Slater was also an early proponent of S/M safety, and one of the major AIDS activists and educators during the late 1970s. Slater hosted Society of Janus safety demonstrations during the late 1970s, cultivating a space for women within the 'plurality of gay men' already present within the leather/kink/fetish Venn-diagramatic culture.\\"THE JANUS SOCIETY: KISS AND DON‚ÄôT TELL Cynthia Slater and the Catholic Priest\\", Jack Fritscher. Drummer 27, February 1979. Pat Califia, who identified as a lesbian at the time, was an activist in the San Francisco leather subculture, and is credited for defining the emergence of lesbian leather subculture. On June 13, 1978, Pat Califia, Gayle Rubin, and sixteen others co-founded Samois, a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983 and was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States. (More under \\"Lesbian\\" below). In recent decades the leather community has been considered a subset of BDSM culture rather than the BDSM community being considered a subset of leather culture. Even so, the most visibly organized SM community related to leather has been a subculture of leather, as evidenced by the American competition known as International Mr. Leather (established 1979), and SM in the UK (established 1981). International Ms. Leather was first held in 1987. In 1979 the newly formed San Francisco lesbian motorcycle club, Dykes on Bikes, led what was then called the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade for the first time and has done so ever since (since 1994, the event has been called the San Francisco Pride Parade). Leather and Lace, a woman's leather/BDSM support and social group, was founded in Los Angeles in 1980. The women of Leather and Lace learned the \\"old guard\\" traditions from the men of Avatar.\\"Avatar\\" is probably a reference to Avatar Club Los Angeles. From the home page: :Welcome! :This is the website of Avatar Club Los Angeles, Inc., a non-profit organization providing information and education about safe, sane, and consensual bondage, discipline, kinky and sadomasochistic (BDSM) sex between adults. Leather and Lace had a code of conduct and a uniform that could only be worn once a member earned the right. In a review of 48 cases of clinical fetishism in 1983, fetishes included clothing (58.3%), rubber and rubber items (22.9%), footwear (14.6%), body parts (14.6%), leather (10.4%), and soft materials or fabrics (6.3%). By the mid-1980s, lesbian motorcycle enthusiasts in other cities besides San Francisco began to form motorcycle clubs. In 1984, the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco was held for the first time; it is and was the world's largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture. Jack Fritscher‚Äôs short-story collection Corporal in Charge of Taking Care of Captain O'Malley (Gay Sunshine Press, 1984) was the first collection of leather fiction, and the first collection of fiction from Drummer. The title entry Corporal in Charge was the only play published by editor Winston Leyland in the Lambda Literary Award winner Gay Roots: Twenty Years of Gay Sunshine - An Anthology of Gay History, Sex, Politics & Culture (1991). Competing in the 1986 International Mr. Leather contest inspired Steve Maidhof to organize a conference for members of the growing leather, SM, and fetish community, which would focus on education and political activism. To host this conference, named Living in Leather, Maidhof recruited several friends and leading members of Seattle's leather community including: Cookie Andrews-Hunt, Wayne Gloege, Billy Jefferson, Jan Lyon, George Nelson, and Vik Stump. Together, they formed the National Leather Association (NLA), which officially incorporated in the summer of 1986. In October, they hosted the first Living in Leather (LIL) conference. Adding \\"International\\" to its name in 1991, the National Leather Association-International staged \\"Living in Leather\\" gatherings until 2002. After a period of decline around the turn of the millennium, NLA-I has become more active again and runs a series of awards for fiction and non-fiction writing. The leather pride flag was designed by Tony DeBlase. He first presented the design at the International Mister Leather event in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. on 28 May 1989. Initial reaction to the flag was mixed. According to DeBlase's article A Leather Pride Flag, > \\"Some, particularly on the east coast, reacted positively to the concept, > but were quite concerned, some even offended, that I had not involved the > community in helping to create the design.\\" In June 1989 the flag was used by the leather contingent in a Portland, Oregon pride parade, which was its first appearance at a pride parade. In the 1980s and early 1990s, lesbian leatherwomen were often involved in helping to care for gay leathermen who had been stricken with AIDS. The Leather Archives and Museum in Chicago was founded in 1991 by Chuck Renslow and Tony DeBlase as a ‚Äúcommunity archives, library, and museum of Leather, kink, fetish, and BDSM history and culture.‚Äù In 1997 the (American) National Coalition for Sexual Freedom was founded; the NCSF's mission as described on its web page is: In 2002, an article in the Washington Post publicly highlighted Jack McGeorge‚Äôs leadership in the Washington, DC leather and BDSM community.http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/wapostx.htm McGeorge had made no attempt to conceal his involvement in the BDSM and leather lifestyles; his full name appeared prominently on websites, and he said as much to the Post and other media. He did, however, offer his resignation to Hans Blix, hoping to preserve the credibility of his organization (the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, called UNMOVIC)Harvey J. McGeorge Curriculum Vitae before the weapons inspections in Iraq. Blix refused to accept McGeorge's resignation. Later, Hua Jiang, spokeswoman for U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, said that being into BDSM was no more likely to be a cross-cultural problem in the Middle East than any number of other issues. In 2005 Viola Johnson started The Carter/Johnson Library & Collection, a ‚Äúcollection of thousands of books, magazines, posters, art, club and event pins, newspapers, event programs and ephemera showing leather, fetish, S/M erotic history.\\" In 2009 the Leather Hall of Fame began inducting members. Leather & Grace, a (now defunct) organization of Unitarian Universalist kinksters, was founded in 2011, and combined a red flaming chalice with the stripes of the leather pride flag for their logo. The LGBTQ and Leather Cultural District was created in South of Market, San Francisco in 2018. It includes the San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, with four works of art, which opened in 2017. =Traditions= Throughout the history of the leather subculture, a variety of traditions have been observed, often diligently. While most or all are based on military protocols and ritual, these traditions varied widely between regions, causing much debate today over which traditions are the original or true traditions, or whether the \\"romanticized versions of leather history\\" ever existed at all. As time has progressed and BDSM has become more mainstream (see below), the traditions of leather have adapted. The first major evolution has become known as \\"New Leather\\" or \\"New Guard\\". However, even this is the subject of some disagreement, as many noted authors and historians assert that there are little or no substantive differences. Today, the leather subculture is one of many facets to semi-organized alternative sexuality. Many individuals describe long periods of introspection leading to their choice to identify as \\"leather\\". Others do not necessarily associate their leather lifestyle with BDSM, and simply enjoy the sensory experience of leather. =Representations= The more specific aesthetics of men's leather culture drew on sources including military and police uniforms. This influence is particularly evident in the graphical illustrations of leathermen found in the work of Tom of Finland. The pornographic films of one of his models Peter Berlin from Berlin, such as his 1973 film Nights in Black Leather, also reflected and promoted the leather subcultural aesthetic. Aspects of leather culture beyond the sartorial can be seen in the 1970 murder mystery novel Cruising by Jay Green. The novel was the basis for the 1980 movie Cruising, which depicted aspects of the men's leather subculture for a wider audience. A band associated with leather culture is Village People, which began in 1977. According to Jack Fritscher, Jacques Morali drew his inspiration for the four characters of Village People from the gay BDSM leather bar and sex club the Mineshaft's dress code.Jack Fritscher, Robert Mapplethorpe: Assault with a Deadly Camera, p. 509. Glenn Hughes, the original leather biker of the group, frequently attended there.Jack Fritscher, Robert Mapplethorpe: Assault with a Deadly Camera, p. 466. He sported an extravagant horseshoe moustache and wore his trademark leather outfit on and off stage. As he was the band's \\"biker\\" and a real-life fanatic, he kept his motorcycle parked inside his home. Eric Anzalone was the Leatherman/Biker of Village People from 1995 to 2017, replacing original member Glenn.Holly George-Warren, Patricia Romanowski, Patricia Romanowski Bashe, Jon Pareles. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll. (2001: Rolling Stone Press) p. 1037. However, Glenn continued with management of the band. During his later years, he was known for storming the streets of New York City with his custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Glenn, who was also referred to by the masses as \\"Leatherman\\", was named on People Magazine's 1979 list of most beautiful people. Distinct aspects of heavy metal fashion can be credited to various bands, but the band that takes the most credit for revolutionizing the look is Judas Priest, primarily with its singer, Rob Halford, who openly identifies as gay and wears black leather. Halford wore a leather costume on stage as early as 1978 to coincide with the promotion for the Killing Machine (Hell Bent for Leather in the United States) album. In a 1998 interview, Halford described the leather subculture as the inspiration for this look. Shortly after appropriating the leather look, Halford started appearing onstage on a roaring motor bike. Soon, the rest of the band followed. In the late 1970s many fans of Judas Priest, AC/DC and Meat Loaf began imitating the clothing of leathermen due to the association of such fashions with toughness. Typical heavy metal fashions in the UK, US and Australia included leather battle jackets, combat boots, studded belts, and black leather jackets like the Schott Perfecto. Freddie Mercury of Queen began incorporating leather into his stage costumes during the band‚Äôs 1978 News of the World Tour. By their 1979 Jazz Tour, Mercury was wearing a full leather outfit, which he explained was inspired by clubs he frequented. Leather jackets, trousers, and accessories would feature prominently in his wardrobe for the rest of his touring career. Joan Jett has a leather pride sticker prominently displayed on her guitar. Subcultures Today, while some may still use the term strictly in the old-fashioned sense (i.e., the romanticized Old Guard), more than ever the leather subculture in the 21st century represents the activities of several major sub-communities. These include BDSM practitioners, and people who have a preference for aggressive or masculine sexual styles; people who love motorcycles; people involved in kink or leather fetishism; and people who participate in large-scale cultural and marketing events such as Folsom Street Fair or leather-themed circuit parties. =Lesbian= Although gay men are the most visible demographic of the leather community, there are numerous women who identify as leatherwomen ‚Äì and women have the International Ms. Leather (IMsL) event as their corollary to International Mr. Leather (IML). An example is Joan Jett, who has a leather pride sticker prominently displayed on her guitar. Relatively few lesbian women were visible during the early emergence of the leather subculture. Pat Califia, who identified as a lesbian at the time, was an activist in the San Francisco leather subculture, and is credited for defining the emergence of lesbian leather subculture. On June 13, 1978, Pat Califia, who identified as a lesbian at the time, Gayle Rubin, and sixteen others co-founded Samois, a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983 and was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States. (More under \\"Lesbian\\" below) In recent decades the leather community has been considered a subset of BDSM culture rather than a descendant of that culture. Even so, the most visibly organized SM community related to leather has been a subculture of leather, as evidenced by the American competition known as International Mr. Leather (established 1979), and SM in the UK (established 1981). International Ms. Leather was first held in 1987. In 1979 the newly formed San Francisco lesbian motorcycle club, Dykes on Bikes, led what was then called the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade for the first time and has done so ever since (since 1994, the event has been called the San Francisco Pride Parade). Leather and Lace, a woman's leather/BDSM support and social group, was founded in Los Angeles in 1980. The women of Leather and Lace learned the \\"old guard\\" traditions from the men of Avatar. Leather and Lace had a code of conduct and a uniform that could only be worn once a member earned the right. In New York, there was LSM. Only members of the club were allowed to know that LSM stood for Lesbian Sex Mafia. By the mid-1980s, lesbian motorcycle enthusiasts in other cities besides San Francisco began to form motorcycle clubs. In the 1980s and early 1990s, lesbian leatherwomen were often involved in helping to care for gay leathermen who had been stricken with AIDS. =By age groups= In the United States men's leather culture has been associated with men above the age of 40 but recent years have seen growing numbers of younger leather men; and in much of the rest of the world, including Europe and Australia, there is a merging of the established older leather community with young leathermen and leatherwomen and kink/fetish/gear communities. In Europe younger men have combined the aesthetic and exploration of sexual power with the gay skinhead movement and social-fraternal organizations like BLUF, from the late 1970s. Places and events =Events= The Folsom Street Fair, begun in 1984, is an annual BDSM and leather subculture street fair held in September, that caps San Francisco's \\"Leather Pride Week\\". The Folsom Street Fair, sometimes simply referred to as \\"Folsom\\", takes place on Folsom Street between 8th and 13th Streets, in San Francisco's South of Market district. The event is California's third-largest single-day, outdoor spectator event and the world's largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture. Folsom Street Events now organizes many events each yearhttps://www.folsomstreetevents.org/ including Folsom Europe. Other large events include Easter in Berlin (the largest leather event in Europe), International Mr. Leather and Mister Leather Europe, and Amsterdam Leather Pride (see Wikipedia article in Dutch). =Archives= Many LGBT museums, archives and libraries collect material relating to leather communities, with many holding substantial collections, including the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, and the Leather Archives and Museum, the latter being based in Chicago. In 1991 Chuck Renslow and Tony DeBlase founded the Leather Archives and Museum ‚Äúas a community archives, library, and museum of Leather, kink, fetish, and BDSM history and culture.‚Äù In 2005 Viola Johnson started The Carter-Johnson Leather Library, \\"a non-profit [501(c)(3) pending] organization that consists of a traveling collection of thousands of books, magazines, posters, art, club and event pins, newspapers, event programs and ephemera showing leather, fetish, S/M erotic history.\\" =Cultural districts= The LGBTQ and Leather Cultural District was created in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood of San Francisco in 2018. It includes the San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, with four works of art, which opened in 2017: the four works of art are: A black granite stone etched with a narrative by Gayle Rubin, an image of the \\"Leather David\\" statue by Mike Caffee, a reproduction of Chuck Arnett‚Äôs 1962 mural that was in the Tool Box (a gay leather bar), engraved standing stones that honor community leather institutions (one being the Folsom Street Fair), leather pride flag pavement markings through which the stones emerge, and bronze bootprints along the curb which honor 28 people who were an important part of the leather communities of San Francisco. =Bars and urban districts= Cockring, now closed, was a popular leather and sex club in Amsterdam's Warmoesstraat Many major cities around the world had or have legendary leather bars and clubs, and in some cases a concentration of these associated a particular district with the leather scene: * Amsterdam: the Cockring (now closed) and Eagle bars and Warmoesstraat street ‚Äî noting the closing of most of the leather bars once here, newspaper Het Parool stated in 2015 that \\"the darkroom has been consigned to history because of Grindr\\"https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/darkroom-wordt-herinnering-aan-vorige- eeuw-door-grindr~a3827356/ * Berlin: Tom's Bar and the area around Nollendorfplatz * New York City: the Mineshaft bar (now closed) and the Meatpacking District * San Francisco: the LGBTQ and Leather Cultural District covers the area which traditionally has had a concentration of leather bars and clubs See also * BDSM * Fetish fashion * Fetlife * Hanky code * Latex clothing * Leather Archives and Museum * List of leather events * National Leather Association International * PVC clothing *Catsuits and bodysuits in popular media * Southeast Leatherfest External links * Leather Archives and Museum Leather History Timeline References BDSM LGBT culture Fetish subculture Gay masculinity ","title":"Leather subculture"},{"id":"176461","text":"Leon Frank Czo≈Çgosz (; ; May 5, 1873 ‚Äì October 29, 1901) was an American steelworker and anarchist who assassinated American President William McKinley on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York. Czolgosz was executed seven weeks later on October 29, 1901. While some American anarchists described his action as inevitable, motivated by what they saw as the country's brutal social conditions, others condemned his actions, arguing that he hindered the movement's goals by damaging its public perception.  Early life  Czolgosz was born in Alpena, Michigan, on May 5, 1873. He was one of eight children born to the Polish-American family of Paul Czolgosz (1843-1944) and his wife Mary Nowak. The Czolgosz family moved to Detroit, Michigan, when Leon was 5 years old. When he was 10, while living in Posen, Michigan, Czolgosz's mother died six weeks after giving birth to his sister, Victoria. In his mid-teens, he worked in a glass factory in Natrona, Pennsylvania. By age 17, he found employment at the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company. After the economic crash of 1893, when the factory closed for some time and looked to reduce wages, the workers went on strike. With great economic and social turmoil around him, Czolgosz found little comfort in the Catholic Church and other immigrant institutions, and sought others who shared his concerns regarding injustice. He joined a moderate working man's socialist club, the Knights of the Golden Eagle, and eventually a more radical socialist group known as the Sila Club, where he became interested in anarchism.  Interest in anarchism  In 1898, after witnessing a series of similar strikes, many ending in violence, and perhaps ill from a respiratory disease, Czolgosz went to live with his father, who had bought a 50-acre (20 ha) farm the year before in Warrensville, Ohio. He did little to assist in the running of the farm and was constantly at odds with his stepmother and with his family's Roman Catholic beliefs. It was later recounted that throughout his life he had never shown any interest in friendship or romantic relationships and was bullied during his childhood by peers. He became a recluse. He was impressed after hearing a speech by the anarchist Emma Goldman, whom he met for the first time during one of her lectures in Cleveland in May 1901. After the lecture, Czolgosz approached the speakers' platform and asked for reading recommendations. On the afternoon of July 12, 1901, he visited her at the home of Abraham Isaak, publisher of the newspaper Free Society, in Chicago and introduced himself as Fred Nieman (nobody), but Goldman was on her way to the train station. He only had enough time to explain to her about his disappointment in Cleveland's socialists, and for Goldman to introduce him to her anarchist friends who were at the train station. She later wrote a piece in defense of Czolgosz, which paints a portrait of him and his history much at odds with what has been recorded: \\"Who can tell how many times this American child has gloried in the celebration of the 4th of July, or on Decoration Day, when he faithfully honored the nation‚Äôs dead? Who knows but what he, too, was willing to 'fight for his country and die for her liberty?\\" In the weeks that followed, his social awkwardness, his evasiveness, and his blunt inquiries about secret societies around Isaak and another anarchist, Emil Schilling, caused the radical Free Society newspaper to issue a warning pertaining to Czolgosz, on September 1, reading: Czolgosz believed there was a great injustice in American society, an inequality which allowed the wealthy to enrich themselves by exploiting the poor. He concluded that the reason for this was the structure of government itself. Then he learned of a European crime which changed his life: On July 29, 1900, King Umberto I of Italy had been shot dead by anarchist Gaetano Bresci. Bresci told the press that he had decided to take matters into his own hands for the sake of the common man. New York City police lieutenant Joseph Petrosino believed that the same Italian-based anarchist group suspected of responsibility for King Umberto's death was also targeting President McKinley, but his warnings were ignored.  Assassination of President William McKinley  On August 31, 1901, Czolgosz traveled to Buffalo, New York, the site of the Pan-American Exposition, where he rented a room in Nowak's Hotel at 1078 Broadway. On September 6, Czolgosz went to the exposition armed with a concealed .32 caliber Iver Johnson \\"Safety Automatic\\" revolver he had purchased four days earlier.Leon Czolgosz and the Trial ‚Äî \\"Lights out in the City of Light\\" ‚Äî Anarchy and Assassination at the Pan-American Exposition He approached McKinley, who had been standing in a receiving line inside the Temple of Music, greeting the public for ten minutes. At 4:07 P.M., Czolgosz reached the front of the line. McKinley extended his hand. Czolgosz slapped it aside and shot the President in the abdomen twice, at point blank range: the first bullet ricocheted off a coat button and lodged in McKinley's jacket; the other seriously wounded him in his stomach. McKinley's stomach wound was not lethal, but he died eight days later on September 14, 1901 of an infection which had spread from the wound. James Parker, a man standing directly behind Czolgosz, struck the assassin in the neck and knocked the gun out of his hand; as McKinley slumped backwards, members of the crowd began beating Czolgosz. \\"Go easy on him, boys\\", the President told the attackers. The police struggled to keep the angry crowd off Czolgosz. Czolgosz was taken to Buffalo's 13th Precinct house at 346 Austin Street and held in a cell there until he was moved to police headquarters.

On September 16, he was brought to the Erie County Jail ahead of being arraigned before County Judge Emery. After the arraignment, Czolgosz was transferred to Auburn State Prison. A grand jury indicted Czolgosz on September 16 with one count of first-degree murder. Throughout his incarceration, Czolgosz spoke freely with his guards, but he refused every interaction with Robert C. Titus and Loran L. Lewis, the prominent judges-turned-attorneys assigned to defend him, and with the expert psychiatrist sent to test his sanity. The case was prosecuted by the Erie County District Attorney, Thomas Penney, and assistant D.A. Frederick Haller, whose performance was described as \\"flawless\\". Although Czolgosz answered that he was pleading \\"Guilty\\", presiding Judge Truman C. White overruled him and entered a \\"Not Guilty\\" plea on his behalf.Hamilton, Dr. Allan McLane. Autobiography. Pre-1921 Czolgosz's trial began in the state courthouse in Buffalo on September 23, 1901, only nine days after McKinley died. Prosecution testimony took two days and consisted principally of the doctors who treated McKinley and various eyewitnesses to the shooting. Lewis and his co-counsel called no witnesses, which Lewis in his closing argument attributed to Czolgosz's refusal to cooperate with them. In his 27-minute address to the jury, Lewis took pains to praise McKinley. Scott Miller, author of The President and the Assassin, notes that the closing argument was more calculated to defend the attorney's \\"place in the community, rather than an effort to spare his client the electric chair\\". Even had the jury believed the defense that Czolgosz was insane, by claiming that no sane man would have shot and killed the president in such a public and blatant manner, knowing he would be caught, there was still the legal definition of insanity to be overcome. Under New York law, Czolgosz was legally insane only if he was unable to understand what he was doing. And the jury was unconvinced of Czolgosz's insanity due to the directions given to them by White, thus convicting him in only less than a half-hour of deliberations (a jury member later said it would have been sooner but they wanted to review the evidence before conviction). Czolgosz had two visits the night before his execution, one with two clergymen and another later in the night with his brother and brother-in-law. Even though Czolgosz refused Father Fudzinski and Father Hickey twice, Superintendent Collins permitted their visit and escorted them to his cell. The priests pleaded for 45-minutes for him to repent but he refused and they left. His brother and brother-in-law visited after the priests had left. His brother asked him \\"Who got you into this scrape?\\" to which Leon responded \\"No one. Nobody had anything to do with it but me.\\" His brother responded saying this was unlike him and was not how he was raised. When asked by his brother if he wanted the priests to come back he responded, \\"No, ---- them; don't send them here again I don't want them\\" and \\"Don't you have any praying over me when I'm dead, I don't want it. I don't want none of their ---- religion.\\" His father wrote a letter to his son the night before his execution, wishing him luck and informing him that he could no longer help him and Leon had to \\"pay the price for his actions.\\" His last words were: \\"I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good peoplethe good working people. I am not sorry for my crime. I am sorry I could not see my father.\\" Czolgosz was electrocuted by three jolts, each of 1,800 volts, in Auburn Prison on October 29, 1901, 45 days after his victim's death. He was pronounced dead at 7:14 a.m. Czolgosz's brother, Waldek, and his brother-in-law, Frank Bandowski, were in attendance at the execution. When Waldek asked the warden for his brother's body to be taken for proper burial, he was informed that he \\"would never be able to take it away\\" and that crowds of people would mob him. Although post- trial Czolgosz and his attorneys were informed of his right to appeal the sentence, they chose not to after Czolgosz declined to appeal, and because the attorneys knew that there were no grounds for appeal; the trial had been \\"quick, swift, and fair.\\" Czolgosz was autopsied by John E. Gerin; his brain was autopsied by Edward Anthony Spitzka. The autopsy showed his teeth were normal but in poor condition; likewise the external genitals were normal, although scars were present, the result of chancroids. The autopsy showed the deceased was in good health; a death mask was made of his face. The body was buried on prison grounds following the autopsy. Prison authorities had planned to inter the body with quicklime to hasten its decomposition, but decided otherwise after testing quicklime on a sample of meat. After determining that they were not legally limited to the use of quicklime for the process, they poured sulfuric acid into Czolgosz's coffin so that his body would be completely disfigured. The warden estimated that the acid caused the body to disintegrate within 12 hours. His clothes and possessions were burned in the prison incinerator to discourage exhibitions of his life.  Legacy  Emma Goldman was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the assassination, but was released, due to insufficient evidence. She later incurred a great deal of negative publicity when she published \\"The Tragedy at Buffalo\\". In the article, she compared Czolgosz to Marcus Junius Brutus, the assassin of Julius Caesar, and called McKinley the \\"president of the money kings and trust magnates.\\" Other anarchists and radicals were unwilling to support Goldman's effort to aid Czolgosz, believing that he had harmed the movement. The scene of the crime, the Temple of Music, was demolished in November 1901, along with the rest of the Exposition grounds. A stone marker in the median of Fordham Drive, a residential street in Buffalo, marks the approximate spot () where the shooting occurred. Czolgosz's revolver is on display in the Pan-American Exposition exhibit at the Buffalo History Museum in Buffalo. Lloyd Vernon Briggs, who later became the Director of the Massachusetts Department for Mental Hygiene, reviewed the Czolgosz case in 1901 on behalf of Dr. Walter Channing shortly after Czolgosz's death. Czolgosz is buried at Soule Cemetery in Cayuga County, New York.  Portrayals in media  Czolgosz's death was re- enacted in the silent film Execution of Czolgosz with Panorama of Auburn Prison. Czolgosz is also featured as a central character of Stephen Sondheim's musical Assassins, in which his assassination of McKinley is depicted in a musical number called \\"The Ballad of Czolgosz\\". He was also portrayed in the Reaper episode \\"Leon\\" by Patton Oswalt as an escaped/captured/released/re- captured soul from Hell who could turn his arms into large guns, but had issues with his father. The 1990 film Slacker also makes a reference to Czolgosz, with a photograph on the wall. In season seven, episode fifteen, of the CBC television drama series Murdoch Mysteries, \\"The Spy Who Came Up to the Cold\\" (2014), Leon Czolgosz is portrayed by Goran Stjepanovic.

Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim's computer will be flooded with traffic. This can slow down the victim's computer to the point where it becomes impossible to work on. History The original smurf was written by Dan Moschuk, aka TFreak. In the late 1990s, many IP networks would participate in Smurf attacks if prompted (that is, they would respond to ICMP requests sent to broadcast addresses). The name comes from the idea of very small, but numerous attackers overwhelming a much larger opponent (see Smurfs). Today, administrators can make a network immune to such abuse; therefore, very few networks remain vulnerable to Smurf attacks.For example, netscan.org (Web Archive) showed 122,945 broken networks as of Jan 25, 1999, but only 2,417 as of Jan 06, 2005. Mitigation The fix is two- fold: #Configure individual hosts and routers to not respond to ICMP requests or broadcasts; or #Configure routers to not forward packets directed to broadcast addresses. Until 1999, standards required routers to forward such packets by default. Since then, the default standard was changed to not forward such packets.D. Senie, \\"Changing the Default for Directed Broadcasts in Routers\\", RFC 2644, BCP 34 Another proposed solution is network ingress filtering, which rejects the attacking packets on the basis of the forged source address.P.

A Smurf amplifier is a computer network that lends itself to being used in a Smurf attack. Smurf amplifiers act to worsen the severity of a Smurf attack because they are configured in such a way that they generate a large number of ICMP replies to the victim at the spoofed source IP address. Fraggle attack A Fraggle attack is a variation of a Smurf attack where an attacker sends a large amount of UDP traffic to ports 7 (Echo) and 19 (CHARGEN) It works very similarly to the Smurf attack in that many computers on the network will respond to this traffic by sending traffic back to the spoofed source IP of the victim, flooding it with traffic. , the source code of the attack, was also released by TFreak.Anonymous.

The name is taken from a poem by the South African revolutionary poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, who believed he was in the last era of poetry before guns would take over. The original users of that name were the trio of Felipe Luciano, Gylan Kain, and David Nelson. The versions of the group led by Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin and Umar Bin Hassan had the largest impact on popular culture. The Last Poets were one of the earliest influences on hip-hop music. Critic Jason Ankeny wrote: \\"With their politically charged raps, taut rhythms, and dedication to raising African-American consciousness, the Last Poets almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the emergence of hip-hop.\\"Ankeny, Jason, [ Allmusic.com profile of Last Poets]; accessed February 01, 2007. The British music magazine NME stated, \\"Serious spokesmen like Gil Scott-Heron, The Last Poets, and later Gary Byrd, paved the way for the many socially committed Black [emcees] a decade later.\\" History The Original Last Poets were formed on May 19, 1968 (Malcolm X's birthday), at Marcus Garvey Park in East Harlem. On October 24th 1968, the group performed on pioneering New York television program Soul!.\\"\\", SOUL! EPISODE LIST, 1968-1973, WNET, thirteen.org. Luciano, Kain, Abiodune Oyewole and Nelson recorded separately as The Original Last Poets, gaining some renown as the soundtrack artists (without Oyewole) of the 1971 film Right On! In 1972, they appeared on Black Forum Records album Black Spirits - Festival Of New Black Poets In America with \\"And See Her Image In The River\\" and \\"Song of Ditla, part II\\", recorded live at the Apollo Theatre, Harlem, New York. A book of the same name was published by Random House (1972 - ). The original group actually consisted of Gylan Kain, David Nelson and Abiodun Oyewole. Following their get-together on May 19, 1968 (Malcolm X's birthday), at Marcus Garvey Park, the group coalesced via a 1969 Harlem writers' workshop known as East Wind. When Nelson left, he was replaced by Felipe Luciano, who would later leave to establish the Young Lords. When Kain and Nelson then began to pursue other interests (theater and ministry respectively), Abiodun Oyewole \\"recruited\\" Alafia Pudim (later known as Jalaluddin Mansur) and Umar bin Hassan in an attempt to replace the founding members of the group. Following the success of the newly refigured Last Poets first album, founding members Kain and Nelson got together with Luciano and recorded their only album Right On in 1970, the soundtrack to a documentary movie of the same name that finally saw release in 1971. (See also Performance (1970 film featuring Mick Jagger) soundtrack song \\"Wake Up, Niggers\\".) Following a legal battle between the two groups concerning ownership of the band's name, The Right On album was released under the group name The Original Last Poets to simultaneously establish the founding members' primacy and distance themselves from the other group of the same name.Article in Blues and Soul (April 1981) Jalal Mansur Nuriddin a.k.a. Alafia Pudim, Umar Bin Hassan, and Abiodun Oyewole, along with poet Sulaiman El-Hadi and percussionist Nilaja Obabi (Raymond \\"Mac\\" Hurrey), are generally considered the best-known members of the various lineups. Jalal, Umar, and Nilaja appeared on the group's 1970 self-titled debut LP and follow-up This Is Madness. Nilija then left, and a third poet, Sulaiman El-Hadi, was added. This Jalal-Sulaiman version of the group made six albums together but recorded only sporadically without much promotion after 1977. Having reached US Top 10 chart success with its debut album, the Last Poets went on to release the follow-up, This Is Madness, without then-incarcerated Abiodun Oyewole. The album featured more politically charged poetry that resulted in the group being listed under the counter-intelligence program COINTELPRO during the Richard Nixon administration. Hassan left the group following This Is Madness to be replaced by Sulaiman El-Hadi (now deceased) in time for Chastisment (1972). The album introduced a sound the group called \\"jazzoetry\\", leaving behind the spare percussion of the previous albums in favor of a blending of jazz and funk instrumentation with poetry. The music further developed into free-jazz‚Äìpoetry with Hassan's brief return on Blue Thumb album At Last (1973), as yet the only Last Poets release still unavailable on CD. The remainder of the 1970s saw a decline in the group's popularity in America, although they became quite popular in Europe. In the 1980s and beyond, however, the group gained renown with the rise of hip-hop music, often being name-checked as grandfathers and founders of the new movement, often citing the Jalaluddin solo project Hustler's Convention (1973) as their inspiration. Because of this the band was also interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary Big Fun In The Big Town. Nuriddin and El-Hadi worked on several projects under the Last Poets name, working with bassist and producer Bill Laswell, including 1984's Oh My People and 1988's Freedom Express, and recording the final El Hadi‚ÄìNuriddin collaboration, prominent Attorney Gregory J Reed reunited Original Poets in NY [ day of Nelson Mandela coincidentally is released from Prison,27 years] and recorded Poets live in Detroit's Orchestra Hall , and produced \\"The Return of the Original Last Poets Docudrama\\" Kain,Lupe,Oyewole and Nelson after 20 years in 1990,Scatterrap/Home, in 1994. The group, led by Hassan, also made a guest appearance in John Singleton's 1993 film Poetic Justice. Sulaiman El-Hadi died in October 1995. Oyewole and Hassan began recording separately under the same name, releasing Holy Terror in 1995 (re-released on Innerhythmic in 2004) and Time Has Come in 1997. Meanwhile, Nuriddin released the solo CD's On The One (1996), The Fruits of Rap (1997) and Science Friction (2004) under the abbreviated name \\"Jalal.\\" In 2005, the Last Poets found fame again refreshed through a collaboration where the trio (Umar Bin Hassan) was featured with hip-hop artist Common on the Kanye West-produced song \\"The Corner,\\" as well as (Abiodun Oyewole) with the Wu-Tang Clan-affiliated political hip-hop group Black Market Militia on the song \\"The Final Call,\\" stretching overseas to the UK on songs \\"Organic Liquorice (Natural Woman)\\", \\"Voodoocore\\", and \\"A Name\\" with Shaka Amazulu the 7th. The group is also featured on the Nas album Untitled, on the songs \\"You Can't Stop Us Now\\" and \\"Project Roach.\\" Individual members of the group also collaborated with DST on a remake of \\"Mean Machine\\", Public Enemy on a remake of \\"White Man's God A God Complex\\" and with Bristol- based British post-punk band the Pop Group. In 2010, Abiodun Oyowele was among the artists featured on the Welfare Poets' produced Cruel And Unusual Punishment, a CD compilation that was made in protest of the death penalty, which also featured some several current positive hip hop artists. In 2004 Jalal Mansur Nuriddin, a.k.a. Alafia Pudim, a.k.a. Lightning Rod (The Hustlers Convention 1973), collaborated with the UK-based poet Mark T. Watson (a.k.a. Malik Al Nasir) writing the foreword to Watson's debut poetry collection, Ordinary Guy, published in December 2004 by the Liverpool-based publisher Fore-Word Press. Jalal's foreword was written in rhyme, and was recorded for a collaborative album \\"Rhythms of the Diaspora (Vol. 1 & 2 - Unreleased) by Malik Al Nasir's band, Malik & the O.G's featuring Gil Scott-Heron, percussionist Larry McDonald, drummers Rod Youngs and Swiss Chris, New York dub poet Ras Tesfa, and a host of young rappers from New York and Washington, D.C. Produced by Malik Al Nasir, and Swiss Chris, the albums Rhythms of the Diaspora; Vol. 1 & 2 are the first of their kind to unite these pioneers of poetry and hip hop with each other. In 2011, The Last Poets Abiodun Oyewole and Umar Bin Hassan performed at The Jazz Cafe in London, in a tribute concert to the late Gil Scott-Heron and all the former Last Poets. In 2014, Last Poet Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin came to London and also performed at The Jazz Cafe with Jazz Warriors the first ever live performance in 40 years of the now iconic \\"Hustlers Convention\\". The event was produced by Fore-Word Press and featured Liverpool poet Malik Al Nasir with his band Malik & the O.G's featuring Cleveland Watkiss, Orphy Robinson and Tony Remy. The event was filmed as part of a documentary on the \\"Hustlers Convention\\" by Manchester film maker Mike Todd and Riverhorse Communications. The executive producer was Public Enemy's Chuck D. As part of the event Charly Records re-issued a special limited edition of the vinyl version of Hustlers Convention to celebrate their 40th anniversary. The event was MC'd by poet Lemn Sissay and the DJ was Shiftless Shuffle's Perry Louis. In 2016, The Last Poets (World Editions, UK), was published. The novel, written by Christine Otten, was originally published in Dutch in 2011, and has now been translated by Jonathan Reeder for English readers. In May of 2018, The Last Poets released Understand What Black Is, their first album since 1997. The album featured tributes to late artists Prince and Biggie Smalls.

Right and left methods make the approximation using the right and left endpoints of each subinterval, respectively. Maximum and minimum methods make the approximation using the largest and smallest endpoint values of each subinterval, respectively. The values of the sums converge as the subintervals halve from top-left to bottom- right. In mathematics, a Riemann sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum. It is named after nineteenth century German mathematician Bernhard Riemann. One very common application is approximating the area of functions or lines on a graph, but also the length of curves and other approximations. The sum is calculated by partitioning the region into shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas, or cubics) that together form a region that is similar to the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes, and finally adding all of these small areas together. This approach can be used to find a numerical approximation for a definite integral even if the fundamental theorem of calculus does not make it easy to find a closed-form solution. Because the region filled by the small shapes is usually not exactly the same shape as the region being measured, the Riemann sum will differ from the area being measured. This error can be reduced by dividing up the region more finely, using smaller and smaller shapes. As the shapes get smaller and smaller, the sum approaches the Riemann integral. Definition Let f: [a,b] \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R be a function defined on a closed interval [a,b] of the real numbers, \\\\mathbb R, and :P = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{[x_0,x_1],[x_1,x_2],\\\\dots,[x_{n-1},x_n] \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, be a partition of I, where :a=x_0. A Riemann sum S of f over I with partition P is defined as :S = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*)\\\\, \\\\Delta x_i where \\\\Delta x_i=x_i-x_{i-1} and x_i^*\\\\in[x_{i-1},x_i]. (Among many equivalent variations on the definition, this reference closely resembles the one given here.) It does not matter which point in the interval is taken to be x_i^*, since as the difference or width of the summands \\\\Delta x_i approaches zero, so does the difference between any two points in the interval. This is due to the fact that the choice of x_i^* in the interval [x_{i-1},x_i] is arbitrary, and so for any given function f defined on an interval I and a fixed partition P, one might produce different Riemann sums depending on which x_i^* is chosen, as long as x_{i-1}\\\\le x_i^* \\\\le x_i holds true. Some specific types of Riemann sums Specific choices of x_i^* give us different types of Riemann sums: * If x_i^*=x_{i-1} for all i, then S is called a left rule or left Riemann sum. * If x_i^*=x_i for all i, then S is called a right rule or right Riemann sum. * If x_i^*=(x_i+x_{i-1})/2 for all i, then S is called the midpoint rule or middle Riemann sum. * If f(x_i^*) = \\\\sup f([x_{i-1},x_i]) (that is, the supremum of f over [x_{i-1},x_i]), then S is defined to be an upper Riemann sum or upper Darboux sum. * If f(x_i^*) = \\\\inf f([x_{i-1},x_i]) (that is, the infimum of f over [x_{i-1},x_i]), then S is defined to be an lower Riemann sum or lower Darboux sum. All these methods are among the most basic ways to accomplish numerical integration. Loosely speaking, a function is Riemann integrable if all Riemann sums converge as the partition \\"gets finer and finer\\". While not technically a Riemann sum, the average of the left and right Riemann sums is the trapezoidal sum and is one of the simplest of a very general way of approximating integrals using weighted averages. This is followed in complexity by Simpson's rule and Newton‚ÄìCotes formulas. Any Riemann sum on a given partition (that is, for any choice of x_i^* between x_{i-1} and x_i) is contained between the lower and upper Darboux sums. This forms the basis of the Darboux integral, which is ultimately equivalent to the Riemann integral. Methods The four methods of Riemann summation are usually best approached with partitions of equal size. The interval [a, b] is therefore divided into n subintervals, each of length :\\\\Delta x = \\\\frac{b-a}{n}. The points in the partition will then be : a, a + \\\\Delta x, a + 2 \\\\,\\\\Delta x, \\\\ldots, a + (n-2) \\\\,\\\\Delta x, a + (n-1)\\\\,\\\\Delta x, b. =Left Riemann sum= Left Riemann sum of x3 over [0,2] using 4 subdivisions For the left Riemann sum, approximating the function by its value at the left-end point gives multiple rectangles with base Œîx and height f(a + iŒîx). Doing this for i = 0, 1, ..., n ‚àí 1, and adding up the resulting areas gives : A_\\\\mathrm{left} = \\\\Delta x \\\\left[f(a) + f(a + \\\\Delta x) + \\\\cdots+f(b - \\\\Delta x)\\\\right]. The left Riemann sum amounts to an overestimation if f is monotonically decreasing on this interval, and an underestimation if it is monotonically increasing. =Right Riemann sum= Right Riemann sum of x3 over [0,2] using 4 subdivisions f is here approximated by the value at the right endpoint. This gives multiple rectangles with base Œîx and height f(a + i Œîx). Doing this for i = 1, ..., n, and adding up the resulting areas produces : A_\\\\mathrm{right} = \\\\Delta x \\\\left[ f( a + \\\\Delta x ) + f(a + 2 \\\\, \\\\Delta x)+\\\\cdots+f(b) \\\\right]. The right Riemann sum amounts to an underestimation if f is monotonically decreasing, and an overestimation if it is monotonically increasing. The error of this formula will be :\\\\left \\\\vert \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\\\, dx - A_\\\\mathrm{right} \\\\right \\\\vert \\\\le \\\\frac{M_1 (b-a)^2}{2n}, where M_1 is the maximum value of the absolute value of f^{\\\\prime}(x) on the interval. =Midpoint rule= Midpoint Riemann sum of x3 over [0,2] using 4 subdivisions Approximating f at the midpoint of intervals gives f(a + Œîx/2) for the first interval, for the next one f(a + 3Œîx/2), and so on until f(b ‚àí Œîx/2). Summing up the areas gives : A_\\\\mathrm{mid} = \\\\Delta x\\\\left[f(a + \\\\tfrac{\\\\Delta x}{2}) + f(a + \\\\tfrac{3\\\\,\\\\Delta x}{2}) + \\\\cdots+f(b-\\\\tfrac{\\\\Delta x}{2})\\\\right]. The error of this formula will be :\\\\left \\\\vert \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx - A_\\\\mathrm{mid} \\\\right \\\\vert \\\\le \\\\frac{M_2(b-a)^3}{24n^2}, where M_2 is the maximum value of the absolute value of f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(x) on the interval. =Trapezoidal rule= Trapezoidal Riemann sum of x3 over [0,2] using 4 subdivisions In this case, the values of the function f on an interval are approximated by the average of the values at the left and right endpoints. In the same manner as above, a simple calculation using the area formula :A=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2) for a trapezium with parallel sides b1, b2 and height h produces :A_\\\\mathrm{trap} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\Delta x\\\\left[f(a) + 2f(a+\\\\Delta x) + 2f(a+2\\\\,\\\\Delta x) +\\\\cdots+f(b)\\\\right]. The error of this formula will be :\\\\left \\\\vert \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\\\, dx - A_\\\\mathrm{trap} \\\\right \\\\vert \\\\le \\\\frac{M_2(b-a)^3}{12n^2}, where M_2 is the maximum value of the absolute value of f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(x). The approximation obtained with the trapezoid rule for a function is the same as the average of the left hand and right hand sums of that function. Connection with integration For a one-dimensional Riemann sum over domain [a,b], as the maximum size of a partition element shrinks to zero (that is the limit of the norm of the partition goes to zero), some functions will have all Riemann sums converge to the same value. This limiting value, if it exists, is defined as the definite Riemann integral of the function over the domain, : \\\\int_a^b \\\\\\\\! f(x) \\\\, dx = \\\\lim_{\\\\\\\\Delta x\\\\\\\\rightarrow0} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \\\\,\\\\Delta x_i. For a finite-sized domain, if the maximum size of a partition element shrinks to zero, this implies the number of partition elements goes to infinity. For finite partitions, Riemann sums are always approximations to the limiting value and this approximation gets better as the partition gets finer. The following animations help demonstrate how increasing the number of partitions (while lowering the maximum partition element size) monotonically increasing on the interval, a right Riemann sum overestimates the integral by the largest amount (while a left Riemann sum would underestimate the integral by the largest amount). This fact, which is intuitively clear from the diagrams, shows how the nature of the function determines how accurate the integral is estimated. While simple, right and left Riemann sums are often less accurate than more advanced techniques of estimating an integral such as the Trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. The example function has an easy-to-find anti-derivative so estimating the integral by Riemann sums is mostly an academic exercise; however it must be remembered that not all functions have anti-derivatives so estimating their integrals by summation is practically important. Higher dimensions The basic idea behind a Riemann sum is to \\"break-up\\" the domain via a partition into pieces, multiply the \\"size\\" of each piece by some value the function takes on that piece, and sum all these products. This can be generalized to allow Riemann sums for functions over domains of more than one dimension. While intuitively, the process of partitioning the domain is easy to grasp, the technical details of how the domain may be partitioned get much more complicated than the one dimensional case and involves aspects of the geometrical shape of the domain. =Two dimensions= In two dimensions, the domain, A may be divided into a number of cells, A_i such that A = \\\\cup_i A_i. In two dimensions, each cell then can be interpreted as having an \\"area\\" denoted by \\\\Delta A_i. The Riemann sum is :S = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*,y_i^*)\\\\,\\\\Delta A_i, where (x_i^*,y_i^*) \\\\in A_i. =Three dimensions= In three dimensions, it is customary to use the letter V for the domain, such that V = \\\\cup_i V_i under the partition and \\\\Delta V_i is the \\"volume\\" of the cell indexed by i. The three-dimensional Riemann sum may then be written as :S = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*,y_i^*,z_i^*) \\\\,\\\\Delta V_i with (x_i^*,y_i^*,z_i^*) \\\\in V_i. =Arbitrary number of dimensions= Higher dimensional Riemann sums follow a similar as from one to two to three dimensions. For an arbitrary dimension, n, a Riemann sum can be written as :S = \\\\sum_i f(P_i^*)\\\\, \\\\Delta V_i where P_i^*\\\\in V_i, that is, it's a point in the n-dimensional cell V_i with n-dimensional volume \\\\Delta V_i. =Generalization= In high generality, Riemann sums can be written :S = \\\\sum_i f(P_i^*) \\\\mu(V_i) where P_i^* stands for any arbitrary point contained in the partition element V_i and \\\\mu is a measure on the underlying set. Roughly speaking, a measure is a function that gives a \\"size\\" of a set, in this case the size of the set V_i; in one dimension, this can often be interpreted as the length of the interval, in two dimensions, an area, in three dimensions, a volume, and so on.

Metroid follows space-faring bounty hunter Samus Aran, who protects the galaxy from the Space Pirates and their attempts to harness the power of the parasitic Metroid creatures. Metroid combines the platforming of Super Mario Bros. and the adventure of The Legend of Zelda with a dark science fiction atmosphere and greater emphasis on nonlinear gameplay. The series consists of eight main franchise games, three spin-offs and two enhanced-remakes, as well as the Prime Trilogy collection. Metroid has seen a release on each Nintendo video game console except the Nintendo 64 and Wii U. A game has yet to be released on the Nintendo Switch console, although Nintendo announced Metroid Prime 4 would be releasing on the Nintendo Switch at E3 2017. The games have received varying levels of critical acclaim. , the Metroid series had sold over 17.44 million copies. The series has been represented in other Nintendo media, including the Super Smash Bros. series. Additional media includes soundtracks, comic books, and manga. Common gameplay elements The Metroid series contains gameplay elements from shooter, platformer, and adventure games. The series is notable for its non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran, with few or no other characters to interact with. The series has been a 2D side-scroller in all its incarnations until the Metroid Prime series changed the perspective to a first-person perspective, leading to a new first-person shooter element. The player gains items and power-ups for Samus's cybernetic suit primarily through exploration, and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with the suit's arm cannon. Many such upgrades enable further avenues of exploration. A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs. The original Metroid was influenced by two other major Nintendo franchises: Mario, from which it borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping, and The Legend of Zelda, from which it borrowed non-linear exploration. The game differed in its atmosphere of solitude and foreboding. Metroid was also one of the first video games to feature an exploration to the left as well as the right, and backtracking to already explored areas to search for secret items and paths.  Games  The core games in the Metroid series focus on the adventures of Samus Aran and her assignments to wipe out threats to the Galactic Federation presented by the Space Pirates and their attempts to harness various biological weapons such as the Metroids and Phazon. ;Metroid:Samus travels through the caverns of the planet Zebes to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting the parasitic organisms known as Metroids for galactic domination. She confronts the cybernetic lifeform Mother Brain, as well as its guardians, Kraid and Ridley. It was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, also known as the NES in America. It was also released in Japan as a title on the Famicom Disk System. ;Metroid II: Return of Samus: The Galactic Federation deems the Metroid species too dangerous to exist, and after their own failed attempts, employs Samus to travel to the Metroid homeworld, SR388, and exterminate the entire species. After killing every Metroid (among them Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and Omega Metroids) and the Queen Metroid, Samus finds an unhatched egg behind the Queen Metroid's chamber. Before Samus fires on the Metroid egg, an infant Metroid hatches and believes Samus to be its mother. After it helps her escape back to her ship, Samus hands the hatchling over to the Ceres research station for study. It was released on the Game Boy, and is also available on the 3DS Virtual Console. ;Super Metroid: Just after she leaves, Samus receives a distress signal from the Ceres research lab. She returns just in time to catch Ridley stealing the hatchling, having killed all of the scientists. She follows Ridley to a rebuilt base on Zebes, where the Space Pirates are once again attempting to clone the Metroids and use them as weapons. Samus kills the reborn versions of Ridley and Kraid, as well as new guardians Phantoon and Draygon, then confronts Mother Brain once again. Samus is nearly killed in the battle, but the Metroid hatchling, now having grown immensely, rescues her. Mother Brain kills it just after it restores Samus's energy, and Samus in turn destroys Mother Brain with a supercharged weapon known as the Hyper Beam apparently left by the hatchling's death. She then escapes Zebes during a countdown that leads to the entire planet exploding, taking with it the few remaining cloned Metroids. It was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and said to be \\"one of the greatest games of all time\\" by IGN. ;Metroid Fusion: While acting as a bodyguard for researchers on the planet SR388, Samus is infected by a native creature known as the X Parasite, originally the prey of the Metroid species. Doctors surgically remove portions of her armor and cure the X infection with a vaccine created from the DNA of the Metroid hatchling (Metroid II: Return of Samus). The vaccine not only allows her to survive the parasites, but to absorb them to power up her energy and weapons. She is then sent to investigate a disturbance at the Biologic Space Labs research station, where it is revealed that specimens from SR388 had been carriers of the X parasite. An X mimicking Samus, nicknamed the SA-X, has taken control of Samus's old suit, methodically breaking into different parts of the station to allow the X parasites to infect the entire station. While trying to destroy the rapidly multiplying X as well as clones of the SA-X, Samus discovers a secret Federation Metroid breeding program. Before Samus can react, the SA-X discovers the lab and triggers a security system that ejects it into space, killing the Metroids (as the X Parasite and Metroid are natural enemies). The Federation eventually shifts interest towards researching the X parasite, especially the SA-X's capabilities, and orders the shipboard computer to prevent Samus from destroying it. Samus then convinces the computer, whom she had nicknamed \\"Adam\\" after her former Commanding Officer, that the X pose a threat to galactic civilization, claiming that the arriving Federation troops will be overwhelmed by the multiple SA-X patrolling the ship. Adam, in a sudden change of heart, suggests that she alter the station's propulsion to intercept with SR388 to destroy the planet and wipe out both X populations. After fighting one of the SA-X clones and changing the station's propulsion, Samus races back to her ship, where she encounters an Omega Metroid which seems to have escaped the laboratory breach. The SA-X returns and tries to kill the Metroid, since the ice-beam it has seems to be the only weapon able to damage it, but the SA-X is badly damaged in the battle. Samus absorbs the SA-X parasite to regain her suit's Energy, defeats the Omega Metroid and leaves the station before it collides with SR388. It was released on the Game Boy Advance. ;Metroid Prime: Samus receives a distress signal in her new ship and travels to Tallon IV to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a powerful radioactive substance known as Phazon. She discovers that the Chozo once settled on this planet, and their disappearance, as well as the emergence of Phazon, is due to a meteor impacting the planet decades ago. After ruining a Space Pirate mining operation and collecting the twelve Chozo Artifacts that allow access to the sealed impact crater, she confronts and defeats Ridley before delving deeper into the impact site and discovering Metroid Prime, a matured Metroid, mutated and corrupted by Phazon. Metroid Prime had been feeding off the Phazon Core of the meteor to increase in size and strength. During the final battle against Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime grabs and takes Samus's Phazon Suit from her. She flees the impact site and after the credits, there is a glimpse of a dark hand coming out of a pool of Phazon in the arena where Samus and Metroid Prime fought. It is implied that this hand is Dark Samus in the future games and that Metroid Prime by taking Samus's suit becomes Dark Samus. It was released on the GameCube and is the first of the Metroid Prime Trilogy. ;Metroid: Zero Mission: Metroid: Zero Mission is an enhanced remake of the original Metroid designed to retell the game's story. It has an addendum to the original storyline: After defeating Mother Brain, Samus is ambushed by Space Pirates and her ship crash-lands back on the surface. With her ship and arsenal destroyed and armed with only an emergency pistol, she is forced to infiltrate the Space Pirate mothership to find a way off the planet. She finds ancient Chozo armor more powerful than her original while deep within Chozo ruins, then goes on to defeat the Ridley Robot and escapes from the mothership before it self-destructs. It was originally released on the Game Boy Advance, and a version was released for the Wii U Virtual Console. ;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes: Samus is sent to investigate the planet Aether after a squad of GF Marines was lost there. Samus finds them all dead, killed by several creatures, mostly by an evil race called the Ing. The Ing possess life forms, transforming them into monstrous \\"dark\\" versions of their former selves to wage war with Aether's dominant race, the Luminoth. Upon meeting the only remaining member of Luminoth (the others are frozen in stasis chambers, awaiting the destruction of the Ing), Samus learns Aether has been split into two dimensions by a meteor similar to the one that crashed on Tallon IV. Samus agrees to assist by recovering Aether's planetary energy (the \\"Light of Aether\\") from Dark Aether. She does this by going to Dark Aether and absorbing the energy into her suit, then placing the energy back into the Energy Controllers on Light Aether. By completing this task, she destroys Dark Aether and the Ing that inhabit it. The final boss fights consist of one against the Emperor Ing and Dark Samus. Dark Samus vaporizes in front of Samus's eyes, but as she flees, Dark Samus is shown to reform in outer space. It was released on the GameCube in 2004. ;Metroid Prime Pinball: Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball version of Metroid Prime, following the same storyline and has similar gameplay elements; however, it is just presented through pinball format rather than as a first- person adventure. ;Metroid Prime Hunters: When the Federation receives an unusual telepathic message regarding an \\"Ultimate Power,\\" Samus is sent to the remote Alimbic Cluster in the Tetra Galaxy to investigate and secure it. Others have also received the message, and six rival bounty hunters arrive with similar intent. When all parties arrive at the source of the transmission, it is revealed that the message was a false lure sent by an ancient creature known as Gorea, who intended to manipulate visitors into releasing it from a void between dimensions. Upon this revelation, Gorea attacks and syphons the energy from the other hunters, allowing it to commandeer their weapons. After killing Gorea, Samus and the other hunters escape the cluster, empty handed, but alive. It was released on the handheld Nintendo DS in 2006. It was also the first game that many played on the DS since, at its original release in some regions, the console came bundled with a demo, Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt. ;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption: Samus, along with bounty hunters Rundas, Ghor, and Gandrayda, are brought together in a ship over Norion to discuss a Space Pirate infection sweeping the Galactic Federation supercomputer network, one composed of organic Aurora Unit systems. Having this network shut down allows for the Pirates to engage in large scale combat in an attempt to further spread Phazon. As a battle erupts on Norion's surface, enormous Phazon-based seedships, called Leviathans, also begin to rain from the sky onto planets in order to begin corrupting them with Phazon. After a skirmish with Dark Samus which left her asleep for a month, Samus is charged with destroying these \\"Phazon Seeds\\" and restoring functionality to the Federation's computer network, as the other three hunters have mysteriously cut all contact during their missions. Samus is told that after the battle on Norion, her body gained the capability to self-generating non-hazardous Phazon, allowing for her to enter a \\"Hypermode\\" attack frenzy with her suit's PED (Phazon Enhancement Device). After purging three planets of Phazon (including a Space Pirate homeworld), the Federation locates the source of Phazon - planet Phaaze - which is made entirely of Phazon. As the Federation engages the Space Pirates in orbit, Samus enters the depths of the planet and succeeds in destroying Dark Samus and Phaaze, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert and cleansing her body from its corruption. A ship is seen following her into Warp Space at the end. It is the third game of the Metroid Prime series, and was released for the Wii console. ;Metroid: Other M: Samus receives a distress signal and follows it to a mysterious vessel named the Bottle Ship. There, she encounters a squad of Galactic Federation soldiers, including her friend Anthony Higgs and her former superior officer Adam Malkovich. They find out that the director of the ship, Madeline Bergman, has been conducting research on illegal bioweapons for the Federation. Eventually, Samus finds a survivor who claims to be Madeline Bergman, but is later revealed to be an android with an artificial intelligence duplicating that of Mother Brain, so that the bioweapon Metroids can be telepathically controlled. The Federation soldiers are mysteriously killed by a secret assassin among their ranks. Samus refers to this assassin as \\"the Deleter\\". His or her identity is never explicitly revealed in-game, but the Deleter is thought to be James Pierce for a few evidential reasons. Samus later discovers that these weapons are Metroids that have been genetically modified to remove their weakness to cold, making them virtually indestructible. Adam sacrifices himself to detach Sector Zero, the Metroid breeding area, from the main ship and activate its self-destruct sequence. After defeating a Queen Metroid, Samus finds the real Madeline Bergman, who tells her the truth about the android she found earlier. The artificial intelligence, named MB, took on a human shape to build an ideal relationship with the Metroids, similar to the one Samus had with the Metroid hatchling (Super Metroid). After developing emotions, MB revolted, telepathically ordering the cloned Zebesian life forms on the ship to attack their captors. MB appears and attacks Samus and Madeline, but is stopped when Galactic Federation reinforcements show up, led by Anthony, the only surviving member of the original squad. Samus, Anthony and Madeline all escape on Samus's gunship. In an optional epilogue, Samus returns to retrieve \\"something irreplaceable:\\" Adam's helmet. ;Metroid Prime: Federation Force: Announced at E3 2015, Metroid Prime: Federation Force is a spin off of the Metroid Prime series. The game is a 4 player co-op game focusing on missions. It also features a mode called Metroid Prime: Blast Ball. ;Metroid: Samus Returns: In June 2017, Nintendo announced an official remake of Metroid II: Return of Samus for the Nintendo 3DS. It was published on 15 September 2017. ;Metroid Prime 4:In June 2017, Nintendo announced that Metroid Prime 4 is currently in the works for the Nintendo Switch. Rumors from multiple sources have suggested the game was being developed by Bandai Namco Studios. On January 25, 2019, Nintendo released a three-minute video which detailed that development on the game had been restarted from the beginning, with Retro Studios taking over from the still-unconfirmed original developer. Development =History= alt=A video game screenshot. A person in a powered exoskeleton travels through a cave, while winged monsters hang from the ceiling. Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R&D1;) began development of Metroid, an action game for the Family Computer Disk System that was released in Japan on August 6, 1986. In North America and Europe, Metroid was published for the Nintendo Entertainment System in August 1987 and on January 15, 1988, respectively. Unlike the Japanese release, the Western versions of the game used passwords instead of a save system. Codes also allow for changes in gameplay; the \\"NARPAS SWORD\\" code grants Samus infinite ammunition, health, all power-ups, and a modified Ice Beam. A sequel, Metroid II: Return of Samus, was released for the Game Boy in 1991 in North America, and in 1992 in Japan. It was the first game of the Metroid series whose North American release featured a save system, allowing the player to have three separate save files. Metroid II also established the current \\"look\\" of Samus Aran and her Power Suit, namely the bulky look of the Varia Suit upgrade and the visual difference between the \\"Beam Mode\\" and \\"Missile Mode\\" of Samus's arm cannon. Dan Owsen of Nintendo acknowledged in an interview that Nintendo R&D1; was involved in developing the Game Boy Color. He noted that Nintendo R&D1; included a special \\"Metroid palette\\" in the console's hardware, which \\"makes Metroid II look really, really nice on Game Boy Color\\", remarking that this made the game's graphics comparable to the original Metroid. Director Yoshio Sakamoto began planning concepts for Super Metroid in early 1990, but his studio was committed to making another game, so developers from Intelligent Systems were brought in to help complete the game. After Super Metroid's release, there would not be another sequel for eight years. A Nintendo 64 game was considered during the period, but Nintendo \\"couldn't come up with any concrete ideas\\". In 1999, Retro Studios, a newly formed second-party developer based in Austin, Texas, was given the project for Metroid Prime. Nintendo rarely allows overseas teams to work on its games but this was one occasion when they allowed a high-profile game to be developed by a studio outside Japan. After it became a top seller on the GameCube, a trilogy was authorized. Rumors abounded since 2005 about the development of a game called Metroid Dread, supposedly a 2D side-scroller for the Nintendo DS. In Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, there is a message in the Metroid breeding zone of the Space Pirate Homeworld on a computer panel that if scanned says \\"Experiment status report update: Metroid project 'Dread' is nearing the final stages of completion.\\" Developers from Retro Studios gave a full but cryptic denial of any connection with the rumored game, and Nintendo denied they were making another 2D Metroid game. However, at E3 2009, Sakamoto confirmed Metroid Dread existed at one point, and may still be in development, though in a later interview Sakamoto stated that Nintendo prefers to keep secrecy on the project, and also that he would like to \\"reset the situation at once and start from scratch.\\" On the May 3, 2010, 75th episode of IGN's Nintendo Voice Chat Podcast, editor Craig Harris confirmed that the story for Metroid Dread was fully written and he had seen it at one point in time, claiming \\"[Nintendo] has it and can bring it back at any time.\\" A new Metroid game was announced at E3 2009, Metroid: Other M. It was developed in cooperation with Team Ninja and directed by long-time series developer Yoshio Sakamoto. It was released on the Wii on August 31, 2010. Sakamoto complimented Team Ninja's work and expressed interest in working with them again, but said he currently has no ideas for new Metroid games. Retro Studios' senior designer Mike Wikan said he would like to see a game continuing the story of the Prime trilogy, and producer Kensuke Tanabe said other Prime-like games could explore Samus' unique abilities such as the Morph Ball in a multiplayer feature. While Nintendo did not formally announce plans for a Metroid game for the Wii U, Animal Crossing producer Katsuya Eguchi mentioned in an interview how such a game could make use of the console's tablet controller to perform actions such as scanning enemies and retrieving information. A demo program for the Wii U, Battle Mii, showed Mii characters dressed in Varia Suits, as well as Samus's gunship from Other M; this was later revealed as a mini-game called \\"Metroid Blast\\", which is featured in Nintendo Land. Nintendo Land producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who was also involved with the Prime trilogy, has declared that this minigame reflects his ideas for future Metroid games, while also displaying the series is \\"a franchise that we value and we certainly want to see what we can do with it in the future\\". Miyamoto added that Retro is \\"a very high priority\\" in the development of more Metroid games. In 2014, a former artist from Next Level Games revealed his company had interest in developing a 3DS Metroid game, going as far as building a prototype, before Nintendo asked them to do Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon instead. In 2016, Nintendo released Metroid Prime: Federation Force, the first game in six years. Nintendo were criticized for releasing a multiplayer-focused spin-off, rather than a core series game after such a long interim. The following year saw the release of Metroid: Samus Returns, a side-scrolling remake of Metroid II, with Metroid Prime 4 announced for the Nintendo Switch in the future. =Creation and design= alt=A video game screenshot. A weapon points outwards towards a snowy landscape. Metroid was designed to be a shooting game that combined the platform jumping of Super Mario Bros. with the non-linear exploration of The Legend of Zelda and a distinctly darker aesthetic. The name of the game is a portmanteau of the words \\"metro\\" (as in rapid transit) and android, and was meant to allude to the mainly underground setting of the first game as well as its robot-like protagonist. Halfway through development of the original Metroid, one of the staff said to his fellow developers \\"Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?\\", and the idea was accepted. Ridley Scott's 1979 science- fiction horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a \\"huge influence\\" after the world of the first Metroid had been created. In recognition of this, a main antagonist was given the name Ridley, after director Ridley Scott. The development staff were also influenced by the work of the film's creature designer H. R. Giger, finding his style to be fitting for the Metroid universe. Metroid, Metroid II: Return of Samus, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, and Metroid: Zero Mission were all developed by Nintendo's internal R&D1; division. The games which have been developed by separate teams are Metroid Prime, Prime 2, Prime 3 and Prime 4 (Retro Studios), Metroid Prime Hunters (Nintendo Software Technology Corporation), Metroid Prime Pinball (Fuse Games), and Metroid: Other M (Project M). The central figures in the production and development of the Metroid series are Satoru Okada, who directed Metroid and created the series; Yoshio Sakamoto, who acted as a character designer for the first game and has directed or supervised the development of most of the subsequent games; Gunpei Yokoi, who headed the R&D1; division and produced the first two games; Makoto Kano, who wrote the scenario for Metroid, co-designed the second game, and produced the third; and Hiroji Kiyotake, who designed characters for the original game. Mario and The Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto was involved with the Prime trilogy, having been the one that suggested Retro to work with the franchise. =Audio= The Metroid series has been noted and praised for its unique style of video game music. Hirokazu \\"Hip\\" Tanaka, composer of the original Metroid, has said he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a \\"living organism\\" and had no distinction between music and sound effects. The only time the main Metroid theme was heard was after Mother Brain is defeated; this is intended to give the player a catharsis. At all other times, no melodies are present in the game. The composer of Super Metroid, Kenji Yamamoto, came up with some of the games' themes by humming them to himself while riding his motorcycle to work. He was asked to compose the music for Metroid Prime to reinforce the series continuity. Metroid Prime's Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound was mixed by a member of Dolby. Developers from Retro Studios noted how the 6 MB memory budget for all sound effects of a level in Metroid Prime was crucial in producing a quality soundtrack, as each sound had to be of very high quality to be included. Composer Kenji Yamamoto utilizes heavy drums, piano, voiced chants, clangs of pipes, and electric guitar. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption took advantage of the increase in the amount of RAM that took place when the series switched from the GameCube to the Wii; this allowed for higher quality audio samples to be used and thus allowing a better overall audio quality. Kenji Yamamoto, who composed the music to Super Metroid and the Prime trilogy, copied the musical design of the original Metroid in Metroid Prime 3, by keeping the music and themes dark and scary until the very end, when uplifting music is played during the credits. In other media Characters and elements from the Metroid series have appeared in different mediums. Samus has appeared in Nintendo games such as Super Mario RPG, Tetris (Nintendo Entertainment System version), Tetris DS, Galactic Pinball, Kirby Super Star, Kirby's Dream Land 3 and WarioWare. Several characters and game environments have appeared in the Super Smash Bros. series. Samus is a playable character in all five Super Smash Bros. games. Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. 4 and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate also feature Zero Suit Samus, a version of the heroine using the blue form-fitting suit seen in Zero Mission and the Prime series. Ridley makes cameos in Super Smash Bros., where he can be seen flying through the level Zebes, and in Super Smash Bros. Melee both as an unlockable trophy and in the game's opening, where he is fighting Samus at Ceres Space Station. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Ridley, in both normal and Meta Ridley forms, appears as a boss character. Due to demand from fans, Ridley was made a playable fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate alongside fellow newcomer Dark Samus. Kraid also appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee as a stage hazard in Brinstar Depths and unlockable trophy. Various other characters such as Metroids, Mother Brain and Dark Samus appear as either trophies or stickers in the Super Smash Bros. series as well. Mother Brain was also the primary villain in the Captain N: The Game Master TV show. A Metroid-lookalike enemy, called the Komayto, was encountered by Pit in Kid Icarus for the NES. In Dead or Alive: Dimensions, a fighting game developed by Team Ninja for the Nintendo 3DS, one stage is a replica of the arena in which Samus fights Ridley in Metroid: Other M and features both as assist characters; Samus, however, is not featured as a playable character in Dimensions, as Team Ninja's Yosuke Hayashi stated in an interview that \\"it would be better to let her focus on her job rather than kicking everyone's butt in [Dead or Alive: Dimensions]\\". A Wii U launch game Nintendo Land has a mini-game based on the series called \\"Metroid Blast\\". Comics and manga have been made for various magazines based on Metroid, Super Metroid, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and Metroid: Zero Mission in both the United States and Japan. Samus Aran and other Metroid characters also featured in the Captain N: The Game Master comic books by Valiant Comics. In Japan, six short \\"E-comics\\" were created to chronicle Samus' life and were published by Kodachi. Also in Japan, Comic Bom Bom published a three-volume manga starring Samus called Samus and Joey („É°„Éà„É≠„Ç§„Éâ „Çµ„É†„Çπ&„Ç∏„Éß„Ç§). Both Samus Aran and Link from The Legend of Zelda series were planned to be playable characters for the Wii version of Marvel: Ultimate Alliance however they didn't make the final release. The MMO Kingdom of Loathing has a minigame called \\"Meteoid\\", which is a text-and-button based version of Metroid. =Possible live-action film= In 2003, two producers optioned the rights to create a live-action film based on Metroid, but the rights expired. John Woo acquired the rights a few years later, and Lion Rock Productions was to produce and release the film before 2006, but it either has been canceled or remains in limbo. Sakamoto has expressed no interest in working on a Metroid movie himself, but stated he could support such a project by Ryuji Kitaura, director of the CG scenes in Other M, if the concept and methodologies were good enough. In December 2012, Peer Schneider of IGN published an article explaining the fate and some production details of the proposed John Woo-directed Metroid movie with an exclusive interview with one of the former producers of the Metroid movie, Brad Foxhoven. The movie with John Woo as director was first pitched in 2004 and initially had Nintendo's full support. Foxhoven stated in the IGN interview, \\"Nintendo was quite supportive of the idea, as they were all fans of John's previous films\\" and that production studio Tiger Hill was \\"in it for the long haul\\" and had started a three-year development period. The Metroid movie was originally set for a 2006 release but slipped because Tiger Hill was spending most of the development time attempting to cope with Nintendo's restrictions on the Metroid franchise. The reason for Nintendo's restrictions was the past critical and commercial failure of the Super Mario Bros. movie which, according to IGN, \\"had left an indelible impression on Nintendo and how it would approach future licensing deals with Hollywood.\\" One writer that was brought in to write a script for the Metroid movie, among \\"several writers\\", was David Greenwalt of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Grimm fame, the furthest that the production process reached was \\"a treatment for a live action film that John would possibly direct.\\" The article revealed that early scripts for the movie were going to focus on series heroine Samus Aran and her origin. Tiger Hill wanted to explore Samus prior to her becoming the lone bounty hunter featured in the series. According to Foxhoven, the movie version of Samus Aran was \\"to be an exceptionally talented, but also flawed character who was looking for redemption,\\" and elaborating that, \\"We wanted to see her struggle, to be humbled, and to be forced to rise up against crazy odds. And of course we wanted to see the cool weapons in all of their glory.\\" The major problem that the writers faced was attempting to build-out Samus's back-story, Nintendo had \\"creative\\" and \\"licensing\\" walls that the writers ran into. Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: \\"What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?\\" and further stated that \\"Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers\\" and at the end, Nintendo \\"felt uncomfortable with our team [Hollywood] being the ones to propose those answers\\" which basically caused the Metroid movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees Metroid becoming a movie, stating at the end of the IGN interview that \\"for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point\\" and he revealed that \\"there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing Metroid, and who would be willing to take the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process.\\" Reception The series has been highly praised by critics, being ranked as the 70th top game (collectively) by Next Generation in 1996Next Generation 21 (September 1996), p.47. and the 6th top game in 1999, and as the eighth best video game franchise ever by IGN in 2008. In 2001, Electronic Gaming Monthly chose Super Metroid as the best game ever. The Metroid games have since appeared in other \\"best game\\" lists, with all games released up to 2005 included in a Nintendo Power top 200 Nintendo games list, Prime in the IGN top 100, Metroid, Super Metroid, Prime and Echoes in a list by GameFAQs users; Metroid and Super Metroid in Game Informers list; and Prime and Super Metroid in Edges list. The series has been influential in many other games, including Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Samus Aran was recognized by Guinness World Records as being \\"enduringly popular\\" and as the \\"first playable human female character in a mainstream videogame\\", although Toby Masuyo (\\"Kissy\\") from Namco's Alien Sector predates her by one year. Other characters from the Metroid series have also received their own share of acclaim. Ridley was the number two most requested Nintendo character by IGN and number one by the fans to be added as a playable character to the Super Smash Bros. series and Mother Brain has been commonly ranked among the all- time best video game bosses. The original Metroid has been described as being boosted by its \\"eerie\\" music, adding a \\"sense of mystery and exploration\\" to the game by making the game \\"moody and atmospheric\\". IGN praised the well timed music that helped add suspense to the experience. GameSpot described Super Metroid as better than the original \\"in literally every conceivable way\\", Metroid Fusion was noted for its \\"understated score\\" which fit the mood of the adventure and its excellent stereo sound effects, making it an uncommonly good Game Boy Advance sound experience. Metroid Prime was considered one of the best games ever made upon its release, winning Game of the Year from various publications and websites. IGN called the aural experience with Metroid Prime 2: Echoes \\"mesmerizing\\". Music from Metroid has been frequently re-released as part of \\"best of\\" video game music releases. Metroid Primes soundtrack was called the best sound design on the GameCube. The sound effects were also noted for a high degree of accuracy and blending with the soundtrack. On the popular video game music site OverClocked ReMix, Super Metroid is the tenth most remixed video game, while the first Metroid video game was twenty-fifth. =Sales= The Metroid series has been commercially successful, with Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, Metroid Prime, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption exceeding one million copies sold. By September 2012, the series had sold over 17.44 million copies worldwide. Sales of Metroid games in Japan, however, have typically been lower than in the United States. In particular, the first two installments of the Metroid Prime series didn't sell well in Japan, although it was believed that generally, Japanese gamers rarely like first-person shooters, since it can cause motion sickness to many Japanese players, thus it was suggested that the Metroid series was better suited to the American market, due to cultural differences. In its debut week in Japan, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption sold 32,388 units, ranking it behind Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Kenzan!, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Wii Fit, and Gundam Musou Special. Furthermore, Metroid: Other M was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release with 45,398 copies sold, ranking it behind Wii Party and Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airu Village. It sold an additional 11,239 copies the following week. The popularity and influence of the series, specifically the earlier games, lead to the formation of the Metroidvania genre.

It is believed to have been first occupied between 8800 and 7000BC and continuously inhabited since 5000BC, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Name  Byblos Byblos appears as Kebny in Egyptian hieroglyphic records going back to the 4th-dynasty pharaoh Sneferu (BC) and as Gubla () in the Akkadian cuneiform Amarna letters to the 18th- dynasty pharaohs and IV. In the 1stmillenniumBC, its name appeared in Phoenician and Punic inscriptions as Gebal (, );. in the Hebrew Bible as Geval ();Ezekiel 27:9. and in Syriac as (). The name seems to derive from (, \\"well\\") and (, \\"god\\"), the latter a word that could variously refer to any of the Canaanite gods or to their leader in particular. The name thus seems to have meant the \\"Well of the God\\" or \\"Source of the God\\". Its present Arabic name Jibayl () or Jbeil (Lebanese pronunciation) is a direct descendant of these earlier names, although apparently modified by a misunderstanding of the name as the triliteral root or , meaning \\"mountain\\". When the Arabic form of the name is used, it is typically rendered Jbeil, Jbail, or Jbayl in English. All of these, along with Byblos, are etymologically related. During the Crusades, this name appeared in European records as \\"Gibelet\\" and \\"Giblet\\". This name was used for Byblos Castle and its associated lordship. The Phoenician city, known to the Greeks as B√Ωblos () and to the Romans as Byblus, was important for their import of papyrus from Egypt. The English word \\"Bible\\", ultimately deriving from the Greek words b√≠blos () and bibl√≠on (), may have originated with the Greeks' mispronunciation of the city or its Egyptian export.  History  Terracotta jug from Byblos (now in the Louvre), Late Bronze Age (1600‚Äì1200 BC) Old City of Byblos Byblos harbor by night The old souk in Byblos, Lebanon Byblos is located about north of Beirut. It is attractive to archaeologists because of the successive layers of debris resulting from centuries of human habitation. It was first excavated by Ernest Renan in 1860, as published in his Mission de Ph√©nicie (1865‚Äì1874), then by Pierre Montet from 1921 until 1924, followed by Maurice Dunand from 1925 over a period of forty years. Renan's expedition was to \\"provide the evidence that the city did not move and that Gebeil is Byblos\\" *[Original French]: \\"D‚Äôabord, le site de Byblos √©tait fix√© sans conteste possible. Le passage o√π Strabon d√©finit Byblos une ville situ√©e sur une colline √† quelque distance de la nier, avait √©gar√© les savants. Renan lui-m√™me avait song√© √† Qassouba, mais il comprit vite que cette colline √©tait trop peu importante pour avoir √©t√© le si√®ge d‚Äôune ville telle que Byblos. L‚Äôabondance des fragments antiques recueillis aux environs de la citadelle, la situation des n√©cropoles au nord et au sud de l‚Äôenceinte franque prouvent jusqu'√† l‚Äô√©vidence que la ville ne s‚Äôest pas d√©plac√©e et que Gebeil recouvre Byblos.\\" *[English translation]: \\"First, the site of Byblos was fixed without question possible. The passage where Strabon defines Byblos as a city situated on a hill some distance away from it, had misled the scientists. Renan himself had thought of Qassouba, but he soon realized that this hill was too small to have been the seat of a city such as Byblos. The abundance of ancient fragments collected around the citadel, the situation of the necropolises to the north and south of the Frankish enclosure provide the evidence that the city did not move and that Gebeil is Byblos.\\" The site first appears to have been settled during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, approximately 8800 to 7000 BC.Vogel, J.C. Waterbolk, H.T., Groningen Radiocarbon Dates X, Radiocarbon, 14, 6‚Äì110 / 105, 1972. Neolithic remains of some buildings can be observed at the site. According to the writer Philo of Byblos (quoting Sanchuniathon, and quoted in Eusebius), Byblos had the reputation of being the oldest city in the world, founded by Cronus. During the 3rd millennium BC, the first signs of a town can be observed, with the remains of well-built houses of uniform size. This was the period when the Canaanite civilization began to develop. = Neolithic and Chalcolithic levels = Jacques Cauvin published studies of flint tools from the stratified Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites in 1962.Cauvin, Jacques., Les industries lithiques du tell de Byblos (Liban), L'Anthropologie, vol. 66, 5‚Äì6, 1962. Remains of humans found in Chalcolithic burials have been published by Henri Victor Vallois in 1937.Vallois, H.V., Note sur les ossements humains de la n√©cropole √©n√©olithique de Byblos (avec 2 planches). Bulletin du mus√©e de Beyrouth. Tome I, 1937. Beyrouth.

Tome IX, 1949‚Äì1950, Beyrouth. Early pottery found at the tell was published by E.S. Boynton in 1960 with further studies by R.

Five levels stratigraphy  Prehistoric settlements at Byblos were divided up by Dunand into the following five periods, which were recently expanded and re-calibrated by Yosef Garfinkel to correlate with Tell es-Sultan (Jericho): * Early Neolithic (Early Phase) corresponding to the Pre- Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) of Jericho, represented by plastered floors and naviforme technology, dated between 8800 and 7000 BC; * Early Neolithic (Late Phase) corresponding to the PNA of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) IX (also Yarmukian) between 6400 and 5800 BC represented by pottery, sickle blades, figurines and small points, dated between 6400 and 5800 BC; * Middle Neolithic corresponding to the PNB of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) VIII and represented by pottery, dated between 5800 and 5300 BC; * Late Neolithic corresponding to the Middle Chalcolithic of Beth Shean and represented by pottery, stone vessels, silos, chamber tombs and seals, dated between 5300 and 4500 BC; * Early Chalcolithic corresponding to the Late Chalcolithic of Ghassulian, represented by jar burials, pierced flint, churn and a violin figurine, dated to between 4500 and 3600 BC and, * Late Chalcolithic corresponding to the Early Bronze Age, represented by architecture and cylinder seal impressions, dated to between 3600 and 3100 BC. The Early Neolithic was a later settlement than others in the Beqaa Valley such as Labweh and Ard Tlaili. It was located on the seaward slope of the larger of the two hills that used to compose ancient Byblos, with a watered valley in between. The original site spread down into the valley and covered an area of providing fertile soils and a protected landing place for boats. Dunand discovered around twenty houses although some of the settlement was suggested to have been lost to the sea, robbed or destroyed.Dunand, Maurice., Rapport pr√©liminaire sure les fouilles de Byblos en 1948, 1949, Bulletin du mus√©e de Beyrouth.

Tome XVII, 1964, Beyrouth. The Middle Neolithic was a smaller settlement of no more than adjacent to the older site. The pottery was more developed with red washes and more varied forms and elaborate decorations, buildings were poorer with unplastered floors. The Late Neolithic period showed development from the middle in building design, a wider range of more developed flint tools and a far larger variety of pottery with fabrication including silica. The Late Chalcolithic featured developments of \\"Canaanean blades\\" and fan scrapers. Adult burials in jars started to appear along with metal in the form of one copper hook, found in a jar. Some jars were lined with white plaster that was applied and self-hardened after firing.Dunand, Maurice., Rapport pr√©liminaire sure les fouilles de Byblos en 1957, 1958 & 1959, Bulletin du mus√©e de Beyrouth. Tome XVI, 1961, Beyrouth. Copper appeared more frequently in the Late Chalcolithic period along with multiple burials in tombs and jar handles with impressed signs. Early Bronze Age remains were characterized by the development of Byblos combed ware and a lithic assemblage studied by Jacques Cauvin.Fleisch, Henri., N√©olithique du Proche-Orient, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Pr√©historique Fran√ßais, vol. 49, 5‚Äì6, p. 212. (Contains report on Byblos excavations of 1951 by Maurice Dunand), 1952. According to Lorenzo Nigro, Byblos moved from being a fishermen's village to its earlier urban form at the beginning of the third millennium BC. Fragments attributed to the semi- legendary pre-Homeric Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon say Byblos was the first city erected in Phoenicia and was established by the god Cronus. (Cronus was considered the nearest equivalent to the Canaanite Baal or Baal Hammon in the syncretizing system used by the ancient Greeks and Romans.) = Egyptian period = Watson Mills and Roger Bullard suggest that during the Old Kingdom of Egypt, Byblos was virtually an Egyptian colony. The growing city was evidently a wealthy one and seems to have been an ally (among \\"those who are on his waters\\") of Egypt for many centuries. First Dynasty tombs used timbers from Byblos. One of the oldest Egyptian words for an oceangoing boat was \\"Byblos ship\\". Archaeologists have recovered Egyptian-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the Second dynasty ruler Khasekhemwy, although this \\"may easily have reached Byblos through trade and/or at a later period\\".Wilkinson, Toby, 1999, Early Dynastic Egypt p.78. Objects have been found at Byblos naming the 13th Dynasty Egyptian king Neferhotep I, and the rulers of Byblos maintained close relationships with the New Kingdom pharaohs of Ancient Egypt. Around 1350 BC, the Amarna letters include 60 letters from Rib-Hadda and his successor Ili-Rapih who were rulers of Byblos, writing to the Egyptian government. This is mainly due to Rib-Hadda's constant pleas for military assistance from Akhenaten. They also deal with the conquest of neighboring city-states by the Habiru. It appears Egyptian contact peaked during the 19th dynasty, only to decline during the 20th and 21st dynasties. In addition, when the New Kingdom collapsed in the 11th century BC, Byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of Phoenicia.\\"Byblos\\" in: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, vol. 2, p. 692. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 1992. Although the archaeological evidence seems to indicate a brief resurgence during the 22nd and 23rd dynasties, it is clear after the Third Intermediate Period the Egyptians started favoring Tyre and Sidon instead of Byblos.Shaw, Ian: \\"The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt\\", page 321. Oxford University Press, 2000. Archaeological evidence at Byblos, particularly the five Byblian royal inscriptions dating back to around 1200‚Äì1000 BC, shows existence of a Phoenician alphabet of twenty-two characters; an important example is the Ahiram sarcophagus. The use of the alphabet was spread by Phoenician merchants through their maritime trade into parts of North Africa and Europe. One of the most important monuments of this period is the Temple of the Obelisks, dedicated to the Canaanite war god Resheph, but this had fallen into ruins by the time of Alexander the Great. Traditional Lebanese house overlooking the Mediterranean sea, Byblos. This house is within the antiquities complex and illustrates the modern ground level with respect to excavations = Ancient history = In the Assyrian period, Sibittibaal of Byblos became tributary to Tiglath-Pileser III in 738 BC, and in 701 BC, when Sennacherib conquered all Phoenicia, the king of Byblos was Urumilki. Byblos was also subject to Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (r. 681‚Äì669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (r. 668‚Äì627 BC), under its own kings Milkiasaph and Yehawmelek. In the Achaemenid Empire (538‚Äì332 BC), Byblos was the fourth of four Phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the Persians; the first three being Sidon, Tyre, and Arwad. Hellenistic rule came with the arrival of Alexander the Great in the area in 332 BC. Coinage was in use, and there is abundant evidence of continued trade with other Mediterranean countries. map of Roman era Phoenicia. Ruins at port. During the Greco-Roman period, the temple of Resheph was elaborately rebuilt, and the city, though smaller than its neighbours such as Tyre and Sidon, was a center for the cult of Adonis. In the 3rd century, a small but impressive theater was constructed. With the rise of Christianity, a bishopric was established in Byblos, and the town grew rapidly. Although a Sasanian colony is known to have been established in the region following the early Muslim conquests of 636, there is little archaeological evidence for it. Trade with Europe effectively dried up, and it was not until the coming of the First Crusade in 1098 that prosperity returned to Byblos, known then as Gibelet or Giblet. = Crusader, Mamluk, Ottoman period = Crusader Fort The Crusades- era Church of St. John-Mark in Byblos In the 12th and 13th century Byblos became part of the County of Tripoli, a Crusader state connected to, but largely independent from, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. As Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the Genoese Embriaco family, who created for themselves the Lordship of Gibelet. Their residence, the Crusader castle of Gibelet, along with the fortified town, served as an important military base for the Crusaders. The remains of the castle are among the most impressive architectural structures now visible in the town centre. The town was taken by Saladin in 1187, re-taken by the Crusaders, conquered by Baibars in 1266, but it remained in the possession of the Embriacos until around 1300. Having voluntarily surrendered to the Mamluks, the city was relatively spared from looting following its capture. Its fortifications were subsequently restored. From 1516 until 1918, the town and the whole region became part of the Ottoman Empire. = Contemporary history = Byblos Historic Quarter Byblos and all of Lebanon was placed under French Mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence. The 2006 Lebanon War negatively affected the ancient city by covering its harbor and town walls with an oil slick that was the result of an oil spill from a nearby power-plant. This however has been cleared and the coastal area has since then become a destination for beach goers, especially in the late spring and throughout the summer season. Demographics Byblos's inhabitants are predominantly Christians, mostly Maronites, with minorities of Armenian Apostolic, Greek Orthodox, and Greek Catholics. There is also a minority of Shia Muslims. It is said that the city of Bint Jbeil (\\"Daughter of Byblos\\") in southern Lebanon was founded by those Shia Muslims. Byblos has three representatives in the Parliament of Lebanon: two Maronites and one Shia. Education Byblos is home to the professional schools of the Lebanese American University (LAU). The LAU Byblos Campus houses the Medical School, the Engineering School, the School of Architecture and Design, the Pharmacy School, which offers the only Pharm.D. Program outside the United States accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), the School of Business, and the School of Arts and Sciences. The Campus is situated on a hill overlooking the city and the Mediterranean Sea.  Tourism  Byblos public beach The King's Spring Byblos is re-emerging as an upscale touristic hub. With its ancient port, Phoenician, Roman, and Crusader ruins, sandy beaches and the picturesque mountains that surround it make it an ideal tourist destination. The city is known for its fish restaurants, open-air bars, and outdoor cafes. Yachts cruise into its harbor today as they did in the 1960s and 1970s when Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra were regular visitors to the city. Byblos was crowned as the \\"Arab Tour Capital\\" for the year 2016 by the Lebanese minister of tourism in the Grand Serail in Beirut. Byblos was chosen by Cond√© Nast Traveler as the second best city in the Middle East for 2012, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai, and by the World Tourism Organization as the best Arab tourist city for 2013.

Hanks plays a man who, after being told he is dying of a rare disease, accepts a financial offer to travel to a South Pacific island and throw himself into a volcano on behalf of the superstitious natives. Along the way, he meets and falls in love with the woman taking him there. The film received mixed reviews overall, but positive reviews from some critics, including Roger Ebert, who described the film as \\"new and fresh and not shy of taking chances\\", and was a minor box office success in the US. It has since become a cult film. Plot Joe Banks is a downtrodden everyman from Staten Island, working a clerical job in a dreary factory for an unpleasant, demanding boss, Frank Waturi. Joyless, listless and chronically sick, Banks regularly visits doctors who can find nothing wrong with him. Finally, a Dr. Ellison diagnoses an incurable disease called a \\"brain cloud\\", which has no symptoms, but will kill him within five or six months. Ellison says that the symptoms he has been experiencing are actually psychosomatic, caused by trauma in his previous job as a firefighter. Ellison advises him, \\"You have some life left ... live it well.\\" Joe tells his boss off, quits his job, and asks former coworker DeDe out on a date. Their date is a success, but when Joe tells DeDe that he is dying, she tells him she cannot deal with the revelation and leaves. The next day, a wealthy industrialist named Samuel Graynamore makes Joe an unexpected proposition. Graynamore needs \\"bubaru\\", a mineral essential for manufacturing superconductors. There are deposits of it on the tiny Pacific island of Waponi Woo, but the resident Waponis will only let him mine it if he solves a problem for them. They believe that the fire god of the volcano on their island must be appeased by a voluntary human sacrifice once every century, but none of them are willing to volunteer this time around. Graynamore offers to pay for whatever Joe wants to enjoy his final days, as long as he jumps into the volcano within 20 days. With nothing to lose, Joe accepts. Joe spends a day and a night out on the town in New York City, where he solicits advice on everything from style to living life to the fullest from his chauffeur Marshall. He also purchases four top-of-the-line, waterproof steamer trunks from a fanatically dedicated luggage salesman. Joe then flies to Los Angeles, where he is met by one of Graynamore's daughters, Angelica, a flighty socialite who labels herself a \\"flibbertigibbet\\". The next morning, Angelica takes Joe to her father's yacht, the Tweedledee. The captain is her half- sister Patricia. Patricia reluctantly agreed to take Joe to Waponi Woo after Graynamore promised to give her the yacht in return. After an awkward beginning, Joe and Patricia begin to bond. Then they run into a typhoon. Patricia is knocked unconscious and flung overboard. After Joe jumps in to rescue her, lightning strikes, sinking the yacht. Joe is able to construct a raft by lashing together his steamer trunks. Patricia does not regain consciousness for several days. Joe doles out the small supply of fresh water to her, while he gradually becomes delirious from thirst. He experiences a revelation during his delirium and thanks God for his life. When Patricia finally awakens, she is deeply touched by Joe's self-sacrifice. They then find that they have luckily drifted to their destination. The Waponis treat them to a grand feast. Their leader, Chief Tobi, asks one last time if anyone else will volunteer, but there are no takers and Joe heads to the volcano. Patricia tries to stop him, declaring her love for him. He admits he loves her as well, \\"but the timing stinks.\\" Patricia persuades Joe to have the chief marry them. Afterwards, Patricia refuses to be separated from her new husband. When Joe is unable to dissuade her, they jump in together, but the volcano erupts at that moment, blowing them out into the ocean. The island sinks, but Joe and Patricia land near their trusty steamer trunks. At first ecstatic about their miraculous salvation, Joe tells Patricia about his fatal brain cloud. She recognizes the name of Joe's doctor as that of her father's crony and realizes that Joe has been set up. He is not dying and they can live happily ever after. Cast In addition, two other notable actors in smaller roles are Nathan Lane as Baw, the Waponi advance man, and Carol Kane, inexplicably credited as Lisa LeBlanc, as a hairdresser. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 61% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 5.53/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Joe Versus the Volcano erupts with plenty of screwball energy and thoughtful observations about living to the fullest, but its existential ambition may prove too goofy for some audiences.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"C+\\" on scale of A to F. Vincent Canby wrote: \\"Not since Howard the Duck has there been a big-budget comedy with feet as flat as those of Joe Versus the Volcano. Many gifted people contributed to it, but there's no disbelieving the grim evidence on the screen.\\" Upon its release, Time called it a \\"wan bit of whimsy ... [that] makes no more sense than its synopsis, though Meg Ryan beguiles in three different roles.\\" Fifteen years later, Time critic Richard Schickel listed it as one of his \\"Guilty Pleasures\\"; while acknowledging \\"there are people who think this film... may be the worst big budget film of modern times,\\" Schickel disagreed, saying \\"if you set aside the routine comic expectations its marketing encouraged, you may find yourself entranced by a movie that is utterly sui generis.\\" Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it \\"new and fresh and not shy of taking chances\\"; the film \\"achieves a kind of magnificent goofiness. Hanks and Ryan are the right actors to inhabit it, because you can never catch them going for a gag that isn't there: They inhabit the logic of this bizarre world and play by its rules.\\" He later brought the film to Ebertfest 2012 and wondered \\"why he gave 3.5 stars instead of 4.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack, composed by Georges Delerue, was released in very limited numbers as a promotional item. Only 3000 copies were manufactured in 1990, the year of the movie's release. Because of Delerue's strong following, Var√®se Sarabande re-released the CD in 2002. Shanley wrote two songs for the film, \\"Marooned Without You\\" and \\"The Cowboy Song\\", the former used thematically throughout and the latter performed by Hanks on the ukulele. Eric Burdon's version of Merle Travis's \\"Sixteen Tons\\" was used at the beginning of the film. After Joe leaves the doctor's office, an edited version of Ray Charles's version of \\"Ol' Man River\\" plays. \\"Mas Que Nada\\" by Sergio Mendes & Brazil '66 accompanies Joe while he is driven around New York City. A Spanish version of \\"On The Street Where You Live\\" is sung while Joe is on his date with DeDe. Elvis Presley's version of \\"Blue Moon\\" plays as Joe spends his final night before departing on his journey. On the boat trip, the Young Rascals' \\"Good Lovin'\\", the Del Vikings \\"Come Go with Me\\", and The Ink Spots' version of \\"I Cover the Waterfront\\" are heard. Waponi tribal music includes the melodies \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" and \\"Hava Nagila.\\" Home media The film was first released on home video in late 1990 and was later released on DVD by Warner Home Video in April 2002. The manufacture-on- demand Blu-ray was released through Warner Archive Collection on June 20, 2017, and it received positive reviews for the quality. Stage musical In 2012, San Diego's Lambs Players Theatre presented the world premiere of a musical based on the film. Directed by Robert Smyth, it featured a book, music and lyrics by Scott Hafso and Darcy Phillips, with musical direction by Jon Lorenz and additional musical arrangements by Taylor Peckham.

Three patriarchates were established by the apostles as apostolic sees in the 1st century: Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria. Added to these were Constantinople in the 4th century, and Jerusalem in the 5th century. Eventually, together, these five were recognised as the pentarchy by the Council of Ephesus in 431. In the rest of the history of Christianity, a few other patriarchates were gradually recognised by any of these above ancient episcopal sees. With time, eventually some of them fell due to military occupations following the Islamic conquests of the Middle East and North Africa, and became titular or honorary patriarchates with no actual institutional jurisdiction on the original site.  History  =Apostolic sees= = Pentarchy = Five ancient patriarchates of the Pentarchy, headed by patriarchs as the highest-ranking bishops in the Christian Church prior to the Great Schism, were the patriarchates of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. The East-West Schism of 1054 split the Latin-rite see of Rome from the four Byzantine-rite patriarchates of the East, thus forming distinct Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. The four Eastern Orthodox patriarchates (Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem), along with their Latin Catholic counterpart in the West, Rome, are distinguished as \\"senior\\" (Greek: œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤œÖŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒÆ, presbygenƒì, \\"senior-born\\") or \\"ancient\\" (œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒØœÜŒ±œÑŒ±, pal√®phata, \\"of ancient fame\\") and are among the apostolic sees, having had one of the Apostles or Evangelists as their first bishop: Andrew, Mark, Peter, James, and Peter again, respectively.

Some of the Eastern Catholic patriarchates are active on the same territories. Damascus is the seat of the Syriac Catholic and the Melkite Catholic Patriarchates of Antioch, while the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch has see in Bkerk√©, Lebanon.Annuario Pontificio 2012, pp. 3-5 In the Roman Catholic Church, some patriarchal titles are purely honorary, without an actual residential see, and hence termed Titular Patriarchates, either vested in another (residential) patriarchal see or in the Pope's gift.  Eastern Orthodox Church  Eastern patriarchates of the Pentarchy, after the Council of Chalcedon (451) Nine of the current autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, including the four ancient churches of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem mentioned above, are organized as patriarchates. In chronological order of establishment, the other five are: Bulgarian Patriarchate (the oldest one following the Pentarchy), Georgian Patriarchate, Serbian Patriarchate, Russian Patriarchate and Romanian Patriarchate. The Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch moved its headquarters to Damascus in the 13th century, during the reign of the Egyptian Mamelukes, conquerors of Syria. Christian community had flourished in Damascus since apostolic times (Acts 9). However, the patriarchate is still called the Patriarchate of Antioch. A patriarchate has \\"legal personality\\" in some legal jurisdictions, that means it is treated as a corporation.

It can be applied within a specific domain, or it can be used as a more general adjective. The term has significance in both epistemology and theology, and its meaning and significance in both fields is the subject of continued debate. In philosophy Epistemology, a branch of philosophy, is concerned with the question of what, if anything, humans can know. The answer to the issue of whether or not a human can be infallible depends on the philosophical school. *Advocates of philosophical skepticism claim that one cannot know anything with certainty, much less be infallible. *Infallibilists hold that knowledge requires absolute certainty, in the sense that if one knows that something is true, it is impossible that it could have turned out to be false. *Advocates of subjectivism claim that there is no objective reality or truth, and therefore anyone can be considered infallible, since whatever is within a person's consciousness is considered the real and the true. *Advocates of reason and rationality claim that one can gain certainty of knowledge, through a process of extreme refinement measures unlikely to be perfected enough for someone to assurably say \\"certainty of this knowledge is absolute\\", yet also assume by chance that one could land on the objective without the knowledge being confidently described as \\"universally certain\\", thus as a result, advocates tend to avoid this altogether and instead rely upon Occam's Razor as a suitable means for obtaining knowledge. In theology =Christianity= The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church defines infallibility as \\"Inability to err in teaching revealed truth\\".Cross, F.L. and Livingstone, E.A. (eds), \\"infallibility\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, p831. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997. Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theology claim that the Church is infallible, but disagree as to where infallibility exists, whether in doctrines, scripture, or church authorities. In Catholic theology, Jesus, who is the Truth, is infallible,CCC 889 but only a special act of teaching by the church's bishops may properly be called \\"infallible\\". According to the First Vatican Council (1869‚Äì71) and as reaffirmed at Vatican II (1962‚Äì1965), the earthly head of the Catholic Church, the Pope, is infallible when speaking ex cathedra on matters of faith and morals (that is, when he explicitly intends to use his papal office to teach the whole Church definitively and irreformably on matters which deal directly with faith and morals). However, papal infallibility does not extend beyond such cases, thus making it possible for a Pope to sin and to be incorrect. Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of bishops as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true. In contrast, Protestant and non-denominational Christian churches believe that the Christian Church is indeed fallible, as evidenced by the requirement of Christ's sacrifice on the cross to pay for the sins of the world, including those of his Church, and that only God's word in scripture is infallible. They also completely reject the Catholic claim regarding papal infallibility, citing not just scriptural reasons, but also the many times popes have contradicted each other and the history of mistakes committed by many popes throughout Roman Catholic Church history. Because of the complexity in defining infallibility, some Protestant and non-denominational views confuse papal infallibility with impeccability, as if the Pope were immune from sin.Does papal infallibility mean the pope is perfect or inerrant? . Catholic Answers. Retrieved: 23 March 2013. This is not the Catholic Church's doctrine, which concedes that Popes can sin and may even contradict one another's personal theological opinions. It is evident that the Pope can sin (which every Pope explicitly states in the Confiteor, and whenever he receives the Sacrament of Penance) and a Pope may even succumb to heresy, as suggested in the condemnation by the Third Council of Constantinople (13th and 16th session) which anathematized Pope Honorius I for supporting the heresy of Monothelitism, and which Pope John XXII admitted when he retracted his views on the Beatific vision.Coulombe, Charles (2003). Vicars of Christ: A History of the Popes. Citadel Press. p. 293. . =Islam= Universal teachings Islam teaches that the teachings and guidance by the Prophets with regard to bringing the message of the One true God was infallible. Islam also teaches that the Quran is an infallible text. Additional Shi'a teachings In Shi'a theology, the belief is that the Ahl al-Bayt, including Muhammad, his daughter Fatima Zahra and Shi'a Imams are all infallible. It is believed that they are infallible in the sense that all statements or teachings made by them can be relied on to be certainly true, that all information believed by themselves is true, and that they have complete knowledge about right and wrong and never intend to disobey God. It is also held by Shi'as that there were 124,000 Prophets, beginning with Adam and ending with Muhammad - with all, including the last, being infallible in the same sense as the Ahl al- Bayt. =Judaism= The notion of infallibility in Judaism as it relates to the Tannaim and Amoraim of the Talmud, as well as the Rishonim, Achronim and modern day Gedolim is one surrounded by debate. Some who reject infallibility cite the Talmud, Pesachim 94b: The words of the Mishnah are commented on by numerous commentators, and Judah Halevi argues that evidence mounts that the Geonim and Maimonides perceived that the sages of the Talmud \\"erred in a matter of astronomy\\".Levi, Yehuda, The Science in Torah, Feldheim Publishers 2004, p. 92. Maimonides wrote that the great sages are not expected to advocate positions perfectly in-line with modern science because they were \\"scholars of that generation,\\" often basing their assessments of what \\"they learned from the scholars of the era.\\"Maimonidies, The Guide for the Perplexed part 3, chapter 14. In the Hasidic tradition, however, infallibility is taught in the Chabad tradition in connection with a rebbe.Sources about infallibility of Tzaddikim =Vaishnavism (Hinduism)= In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna (Bg 15.16 to 15.20) References External links Benjamin Brown, 'Jewish Political Theology - The Doctrine of Da'at Torah as a Case Study' Catholic theology and doctrine Concepts in epistemology ","title":"Infallibility"},{"id":"176514","title":"The Beggar's Opera"},{"id":"176519","text":"Three hospital ships of the United States Navy have borne the name USS Mercy, in honor of the virtue of compassion (and owing to their purpose). * , was built in 1907 as Saratoga and was commissioned Mercy (ID-1305) on 24 January 1918, before being re-designated AH-4 in 1920.

It was operated in various forms by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) who used the type throughout the Second World War. The C.200 was designed by Mario Castoldi, Macchi's lead designer, to serve as a modern monoplane fighter aircraft, furnished with retractable landing gear and powered by a radial engine. It possessed excellent maneuverability and the C.200's general flying characteristics left little to be desired.Munson 1960, p. 34. Stability in a high-speed dive was exceptional,Spick 1997, p. 116. but it was underpowered and underarmed in comparison to its contemporaries.Ethell 1995, p. 68. Early on, there were a number of crashes caused by stability problems, nearly resulting in the grounding of the type, which was ultimately addressed via aerodynamic modifications to the wing. From the time Italy entered the Second World War on 10 June 1940, until the signing of the armistice of 8 September 1943, the C. 200 flew more operational sorties than any other Italian aircraft. The Saetta saw operational service in Greece, North Africa, Yugoslavia, across the Mediterranean and the Soviet Union (where it obtained an excellent kill to loss ratio of 88 to 15).De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 10.Ethell 1995, p. 70. Its very strong all-metal construction and air-cooled engine made the aircraft ideal for conducting ground attack missions; several units flew it as a fighter-bomber. Over 1,000 aircraft had been constructed by the end of the war.Ethell 1995, p. 69. Development =Origins= During early 1935 Mario Castoldi, lead designer of Italian aircraft company Macchi, commenced work on a series of design studies for a modern monoplane fighter aircraft, which was to be furnished with retractable landing gear.Cattaneo 1966, p. 3. Castoldi had previously designed several racing aircraft that had competed for the Schneider Trophy, including the Macchi M.39, which won the competition in 1926. He had also designed the M.C. 72. From an early stage, the concept aircraft that emerged from these studies became known as the C.200. In 1936, in the aftermath of Italy's campaigns in East Africa, an official program was initiated with the aim of completely re-equipping the Regia Aeronautica with a new interceptor aircraft of modern design. The 10 February 1936 specifications,Sgarlato 2008, p. 4. formulated and published by the Ministero dell'Aeronatica, called for an aircraft powered by a single radial engine, which was to be capable of a top speed of 500 km/h along with a climb rate of 6,000 meters of 5 minutes.Sgarlato 2008, p. 5. This envisioned aircraft, which was to be capable of being used as an interceptor for performing the \\"defence of the national security in emergency\\" soon had additional requirements specified, such as a flight endurance of two hours and an armament of a single (later increased to two) 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine gun =Prototypes= In response to the prescribed demand for a modern fighter aircraft, Castoldi submitted a proposal for an aircraft based upon his 1935 design studies. On 24 December 1937, the first prototype (MM.336) C.200 conducted its maiden flight at Lonate Pozzolo, Varese, with Macchi Chief Test Pilot Giuseppe Burei at the controls. Officials within the ministry and Macchi's design team fought over the retention of the characteristic hump used to enhance cockpit visibility; after a protracted argument, the feature was ultimately retained. The first prototype was followed by the second prototype early on during the following year. During testing, the aircraft reportedly attained 805 km/h (500 mph) in a dive free of negative tendencies such as flutter and other aeroelastic issues; although it could achieve only 500 km/h (310 mph) in level flight due to a lack of engine power. Nevertheless, this capability was superior than the performance of the competing Fiat G.50, Reggiane Re.2000, A.U.T. 18, IMAM Ro.51, and Caproni-Vizzola F.5; of these, the Re.2000 was seen as the most capable of the C.200's rivals, being more maneuverable and capable of greater performance at low altitude but lacking in structural strength. The C.200 benefitted greatly from wider preparations that were being made for major expansion of the Italian Air Force, known as Programme R. During 1938, the C.200 was selected as the winner of the tender \\"Caccia I\\" (fighter 1st) of the Regia Aeronautica. This choice came in spite of mixed results during flight testing at Guidonia airport; on 11 June 1938, Maggiore Ugo Borgogno had warned that when tight turns at beyond 90¬∞ were attempted, the aircraft became extremely difficult to control, including a tendency to turn upside down, mostly to the right and entering into a violent flat spin.de Marchi 1994, =Production= Shortly following the completion of the second prototype, an initial order for 99 production aircraft was placed with Macchi. The G.50, which during the same flight tests held at Guidonia airport had out-turned the Macchi, was also placed in limited production, because it had been determined that the former could be brought into service earlier. The decision, or indecision, involved in producing multiple overlapping types led to greater inefficiencies in both production and in operation.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 3‚Äì4. In June 1939, production of the C.200 formally commenced. The most serious handicap was the low production rate of the type. According to some reports, in excess of 22,000 hours in production time was attributed to the use of antiquated construction technology.Marcon May 2000, pp. 28‚Äì38. A lack of urgency shown by the authorities regarding standardisation was also viewed as having negatively affected mass production efforts, particularly in light of the lack of availability of key resources in Italy during the era. In order to improve the rate of output, the C.200 remained almost unchanged throughout its production life, save for adjustments to the cockpit in response to pilot feedback. In addition to Macchi, the C.200 was also constructed by other Italian aircraft companies Societ√† Italiana Ernesto Breda and SAI Ambrosini under a large subcontracting arrangement intended to produce 1,200 aircraft between 1939 and 1943.Cattaneo 1966, p. 5. However, during 1940, the termination of all production of the type was considered in response to aerodynamic performance problems that had caused the loss of multiple aircraft; the type was retained after changes were made to the wing to rectify a tendency to go into an uncontrollable spin that could occur during turns. In an attempt to improve performance, a C.201 prototype was created with a 750 kW (1,000 hp) Fiat A.76 engine;. work on this prototype was later abandoned in favour of the Daimler-Benz DB 601-powered C.202. At one point, it was intended that the Saetta was to have been replaced outright by the C.202 after only a single year in production, however, the C.200's service life was extended because Alfa Romeo proved to be incapable of producing enough of the RA.1000 (license-built DB 601) engines. This contributed to the decision to construct further C.200s that used C.202 components as an interim measure while waiting for the production rate of the engine to be increased. At the beginning of 1940, Denmark was set to place an order for 12 C.200s to replace its aging Hawker Nimrod fighters, but the deal fell through when Germany invaded Denmark. A total of 1,153 Saettas were eventually produced, but only 33 remained operational by the time armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in September 1943. Design The Macchi C.200 was a modern all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane, which was equipped with retractable landing gear and an enclosed cockpit. The fuselage was of semi- monocoque construction, with self-sealing fuel tanks under the pilot's seat, and in the centre section of the wing. The distinctive \\"hump\\" elevated the cockpit to provide the pilot with an unobstructed view over the engine. The wing had an advanced system whereby the hydraulically actuated flaps were interconnected with the ailerons, so that when the flaps were lowered the ailerons drooped as well.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 4‚Äì5. The Macchi provided an outstanding field of view, since the cockpit was partially open and placed on the hump of the fuselage. As a result of its ultimate load factor of 15.1, it could reach speeds as fast as 500 m.p.h (True Air Speed) during dives.Palermo 2014, p. 236. According to aviation author Jeffrey L. Ethell, upon its entry into service, the Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied fighter that was capable of out-climbing the Saetta; however, this viewpoint was erroneous.Ethell 1995, p. 69. Power was provided by the 650 kW (870 hp) Fiat A.74 radial engine, although Castoldi preferred inline engines, and had used them to power all of his previous designs. With \\"direttiva\\" (Air Ministry Specification) of 1932, Italian industrial leaders had been instructed to concentrate solely on radial engines for fighters, due to their superior reliability.Brindley 1973, p. 234. The A.74 was a re-design of the American Pratt & Whitney R-1830 SC-4 Twin Wasp, performed by engineers Tranquillo Zerbi and Antonio Fessia, and was the only Italian-built engine that could provide a level of reliability comparable to Allied designs.Cattaneo 1966, p. 4.Sgarlato 2008, p. 14. The licence-built A.74 engine could be problematic. In late spring 1941, 4¬∞ Stormo's Macchi C.200s then based in Sicily, had all the A.74s produced by the Reggiane factory replaced because they were defective units. The elite unit had to abort many missions against Malta due to engine problems.Duma 2007, pp. 200‚Äì201. While some figures considered the Macchi C.200 to have been underpowered, the air-cooled radial engine provided some pilot protection during strafing missions. Consequently, the C.200 was often used as a cacciabombardiere (fighter-bomber).Ethell 1996, pp. 68‚Äì69. Moreover, it was maneuverable and had a sturdy all-metal construction. The C.200 featured a typical armament of a pair of 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns; while these were often considered to be insufficient, the Saetta was able to compete with contemporary Allied fighters. According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, perhaps the greatest weakness of the C.200 had been its light machine gun armament.Cattaneo 1968, Moreover, the radio was not fitted as standard, while its flight characteristics, even if better than the G.50, were not easily mastered by the average Italian pilot, even after new wings, which provided for improved flight characteristics, had been adopted. Like other early Italian monoplanes, the C.200 suffered from a dangerous tendency to go into a spin.Sgarlato 2008, p. 6. Early production C.200 aircraft showed autorotation problems similar to those found in the Fiat G.50, IMAM Ro.51, and the AUT 18. At the beginning of 1940, a pair of deadly accidents occurred due to autorotation. Both deliveries and production were halted while the Regia Aeronautica evaluated the potential for abandoning use of the type, as the skill involved in flying the C.200 was considered to be beyond that of the average pilot.de Marchi 1994. Quote: \\"Sopraggiungono due incidenti mortali per autorotazione che fanno sospendere voli e consegne, si pensa di abbandonare la macchina classificata non pilotabile dalla media dei piloti\\" (Two fatal accidents occurred due to autorotation that caused suspension of flights and deliveries, prompting consideration of abandoning the use of the aircraft, as it was considered \\"unflyable\\" by the average pilot.) The problem was a product of the profile of the wing. Castoldi soon tested a new profile, but a solution to the autorotation problem was found by Sergio Stefanutti, chief designer of SAI Ambrosini in Passignano sul Trasimeno, based on studies conducted by German aircraft engineer Willy Messerschmitt and the American National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). He redesigned the wing section according to variable (instead of constant) profile,Sgarlato 2008, pp. 7‚Äì8. which was achieved by covering parts of the wings with plywood. The new wing entered production in 1939/1940 at SAI Ambrosini and became standard on the aircraft manufactured by Aermacchi and Breda, a licensed manufacturer.Sgarlato 2008, p. 8. After the modified wings of the Saetta were introduced, the C.200 proved to be, for a time, the foremost Italian fighter. As a weight-saving measure, the first production C.200 series did not have armour fitted to protect the pilots. Armour plating was incorporated when the units were going to replace the Saettas with the new Macchi C.202 Folgore (Thunderbolt) and often in only a limited number of aircraft. After the armour was fitted, the aircraft could become difficult to balance, and during aerobatic manoeuvres could enter an extremely difficult to control flat spin, forcing the pilot to bail out. On 22 July 1941, Leonardo Ferrulli, one of the top-scoring Regia Aeronautica pilots, encountered the problem and was forced to bail out over Sicily.Duma 2007, p. 201. Operational history =Introduction= A Macchi C.200 on the ground In August 1939, about 30 C.200s, by then nicknamed Saetta (\\"Arrow\\"), were delivered to 10¬∞ Gruppo of 4¬∞ Stormo, stationed in North Africa. However, pilots of this elite unit of the Regia Aeronautica opposed the adoption of the C.200, preferring the more manouvrable Fiat CR.42 instead. Accordingly, the Macchis were then transferred to 6¬∞ Gruppo of 1¬∞ Stormo in Sicily, who were enthusiastic supporters of the new fighter, and Gruppo 152¬∞ of 54¬∞ Stormo in Vergiate. Further units received the type during peacetime, including 153¬∞ Gruppo and 369¬∞ Squadriglia.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 5‚Äì6. When Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940, 144 C.200s were operational, half of which were serviceable. The re-equipment programme, under which the type would have been widely adopted, was slower than expected and several squadrons were still in the process of reequipping with the C.200 upon the outbreak of war.Cattaneo 1966, p. 6. Although the first 240 aircraft had been fitted with fully enclosed cockpits, the subsequent variants were provided with open cockpits at the request of the Italian pilots, who were made familiar with traditional open cockpits that had been commonplace amongst biplanes. =Service history= The C.200 played no role in Italy's brief action during the Battle of France. The first C.200s to make their combat debut were those of the 6¬∞ Gruppo Autonomo C.T. led by Tenente Colonnello (Wing Commander) Armando Francois. This squadron was based at the Sicilian airport of Catania Fontanarossa. A Saetta from this unit was the first C.200 to be lost in combat when, on 23 June 1940, 14 C.200s (eight from 88a Squadriglia, five from 79a Squadriglia and one from 81a Squadriglia) that were escorting 10 Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s from 11¬∞ Stormo were intercepted by two Gloster Gladiators. Gladiator No.5519, piloted by Flt Lt George Burges, jumped the bombers but was in turn attacked by a C.200 flown by Sergente Maggiore Lamberto Molinelli of 71a Squadriglia over the sea off Sliema. The Macchi overshot four or five times the more agile Gladiator which eventually shot down the Saetta.Cull and Galea 2008, pp. 46‚Äì47. C.200 in flight In September 1940, the C.200s of 6¬∞ Gruppo conducted their first offensive operations in support of wider Axis efforts against the Mediterranean island of Malta, escorting Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers. Only on 1 November 1940 were the C.200s credited with their first kill. A British Sunderland on a reconnaissance mission was sighted and attacked just outside Augusta by a flight of Saettas on patrol.Caruana 1996, p. 166. With the arrival towards the end of December 1940 of X Fliegerkorps in Sicily, the C.200s were assigned escort duty for I/StG.1 and II/StG.2 Ju 87 bombers attacking Malta, as the Stukas did not have adequate fighter cover until the arrival of 7./JG26's Bf 109s.Caruana 1999, p. 169. British air power in the theatre also intensified, chief amongst these being the Hawker Hurricane fighter, which forced a redeployment of Italian forces in response. Although considered to be inferior to the Hurricane in terms of speed, the C.200 had the advantage in terms of manoeuvrability, turn radius, and climb rate. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the C.200 proved effective against the Hurricane, delivering outstanding dogfight performance without any vices.Gunston 1988, p. 255. While the Hurricane was faster at sea level (450 km/h/280 mph vs the C.200's 430 km/h/270 mph), the Saetta could reach more than 500 km/h (310 mph) at 4,500 m (14,800 ft), although speed dropped off at altitude: 490 km/h (300 mph) at 6,000 m (19,700 ft) and 350 km/h (220 mph) at 7,000 m (23,000 ft) with a maximum ceiling of 8,800 m (29,000 ft). Comparative speeds of the Hurricane Mk I was 505 km/h (314 mph) at 5,000 m (16,400 ft) and 528 km/h (328 mph) at 6,000 m (19,700 ft).Lembo 2000, p. 26. Over 5,000 m (16,400 ft) and at very low levels, only the huge Vokes (anti-sand) air filter fitted to the \\"tropical\\" variants slowed the Hurricane Mk II to Macchi levels. Although the Macchi C.200 was more agile than the Hurricane, it carried a lighter armament than its British adversary. On 6 February 1941, the 4¬∞ Stormo received C.200s from 54¬∞ Stormo. Once the autorotation problems had been resolved, the Macchis were regarded as \\"very good machines, fast, manoeuvrable and strong\\" by Italian pilots.Duma 2007, p. 188. After intense training, on 1 April 1941, the 10¬∞ Gruppo (4¬∞ Stormo) moved to Ronchi dei Legionari airport and started active service.Duma 2007, p. 190. The C.200 subsequently saw action over Greece, Yugoslavia and the Balkans, frequently engaged in dogfights with British Gladiators and Hurricanes on the Balkans. =Yugoslavia= A WWII Italian fighter Macchi MC.200 Saetta. From the private archive of Riggio family C.200s from 4¬∞ Stormo took part in operations against Yugoslavia right from the start of hostilities.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 6‚Äì7. On the dawn of 6 April 1941, four C.200s from 73a Squadriglia flew over Pola harbour and attacked an oil tanker, setting it on fire. Due to limited air resistance being encountered, sorties flown by the type in this theatre were dominated by escort and strafing activities.Cattaneo 1966, p. 7. The 4¬∞ Stormo flew its last mission against Yugoslavia on 14 April 1941: on that day, 20 C.200s from 10¬∞ Gruppo flew up to 100 km south of Karlovac without meeting any enemy aircraft. Operations ended on 17 April. During those 11 days, the 4¬∞ Stormo had not lost a single C.200. Its pilots destroyed a total of 20 seaplanes and flying boats, while damaging a further 10. Additionally, they had set on fire an oil tanker, a fuel truck, several other vehicles and destroyed port installations.Duma 2007, pp. 190‚Äì193. =North Africa= Fitted with dust filters and designated C.200AS, the Saetta saw extensive use in North Africa, greater than any other theatre of action. The Macchi's introduction was not initially well received by pilots when in 1940, the first C.200 unit, 4¬∞ Stormo replaced the type with the C.R.42. The first combat missions were flown as escorts for Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers attacking Malta in June 1940, where one C.200 was claimed by a Gladiator. On 11 June 1940, second day of war for Italy, the C.200s of 79a Squadriglia encountered one of the Sea Gladiators which had been scrambled from Hal Far, Malta. Officer W.J. Wood claimed Tenente Giuseppe Pesola had been shot down, but the Italian pilot came back unscathed to his base.Malizia 2006, p. 28. Formation of the Macchi 200 bomber escort, probably on a mission to Malta and Tobruk. During April 1941, the C.200s of 374¬∞ Squadriglia became the first unit to be stationed on the North African mainland. Further units, including 153¬∞ Gruppo and 157¬∞ Gruppo, were stationed on the mainland as Allied air power in the region increased in capability and numbers, such as the Hurricane and the P-40 Warhawk. According to Cattaneo, the C.200 performed well under the conditions of the desert climate, particularly due to its high structural strength and short takeoff run. On 8 December 1941, Macchi C.200s of the 153¬∞ Gruppo engaged Hurricanes from 94 Squadron. A dogfight developed with the commanding officer, Squadron Leader Linnard attempting to intercept a Macchi attacking a Hurricane. Both aircraft were making steep turns and losing height, but Linnard was too late and the Macchi, turning inside the Hurricane, had already hit the cockpit area. The stricken aircraft turned over at low level and dived into the ground, bursting into flames. Its pilot, the New Zealand born RAF \\"ace\\" (six enemy aircraft destroyed and many more probably destroyed) Flight Lieutenant Owen Vincent Tracey was killed. North African and Italian-based units were routinely rotated to relieve war weary crews, aiding the resumption of an Axis offensive in the region during early 1942. During this offensive, which led to Italian and German forces reaching the outskirts of Alexandria in Egypt, the C.200s were heavily engaged in bomber escort and low-altitude attack operations, while the newer C.202s performed high-altitude air cover duties. NMUSAFs Saetta carries the markings of Regia Aeronautica's 372·µÉ Squadriglia, 153¬∞ Gruppo. In addition to its interceptor duties, C.200s frequently operated as fighter-bombers against both land and naval objectives. The North African theatre was the first in which the type had been intentionally deployed as a fighter-bomber.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 7‚Äì8. During September 1942, the type was responsible for sinking the British destroyer and , as well as several smaller motor vessels, near Tobruk during Operation Agreement, an attempted amphibious assault by Allied forces.Cattaneo 1966, p. 8. Following the decisive victory by Commonwealth forces at El Alamein, the C.200 provided cover for the retreating Axis forces, strafing advancing Allied columns and light vehicles. However, operations of the type in the theatre were curtailed around this time by increasing shortages of spares, fuel and components; losses in the face of numerically superior Allied air power also played a role in the rapid decline of deployable C.200s. During January 1943, many Italian aerial units were withdrawn from North Africa, leaving only a single unit operating the type. Bomb-carrying C.200s were amongst those aircraft used during Axis attempts to resist the Allied occupation of the island of Pantelleria. However, early 1943 marked the end of the C.200's viability as an effective front-line fighter. =Eastern Front= In August 1941, the Italian air force command dispatched a single air corps, formed out of the 22¬∫ Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre with four squadrons and 51 C.200s to the Eastern Front with the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia, the first component of the Regia Aeronautica to contribute to the campaign.Neulen 2000, p. 60. By 12 August 1941, all 51 C.200s had arrived at Tudora, »òtefan VodƒÉ, near Odessa. On 13 August 1941, commanded by Maggiore Giovanni Borzoni and deployed in 359a, 362a, 369a and 371a Squadriglia (Flights). On 27 August 1941, C.200s carried out their first operations from Krivoi Rog, achieving eight aerial victories over Soviet bombers and fighters.Neulen 2000, pp. 60‚Äì62. For a short time, the 22¬∞ Gruppo was subordinated to Luftwaffe V.Fliegerkorps.Neulen 2000, p. 62. Subsequently, they took part in the September offensive on the Dnjepr and as the offensive went on, they operated sporadically from airstrips in Zaporozhye, Stalino, Borvenkovo, Voroshilovgrad, Makiivka, Oblivskaja, Millerovo and their easternmost location, Kantemirovka, moving to Zaporozhye late in October 1941.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 8‚Äì9. Maintaining operations became increasingly difficult as winter took hold, the unit having not been furnished with the necessary equipment for conducting low-temperature operations; accordingly, flying was often impossible throughout November and December.Cattaneo 1966, p. 9. In December 1941, 371a Squadriglia was transferred to Stalino, but were replaced two days later by 359a with 11 C.200s. On 25 December, the C.200s flew low-level attacks against Soviet troops that had encircled the Black Shirt Legion Tagliamento, at Novo Orlowka and 359a Squadriglia intercepted Soviet fighters over Bulawa and five of them were claimed shot down without losses. On 28 December, pilots of 359a claimed nine Soviet aircraft, including six Polikarpov I-16 fighters, in the Timofeyevka and Polskaya area, without loss.Neulen 2000, p. 62. According to Cattaneo, during the course of the three-day long 'Christmas battle', a total of 12 Soviet fighters were downed by C.200s in exchange for a single friendly aircraft lost. During February 1942, weather conditions had improved enough to allow for the resumption of full operations. From February onwards, the C.200 was employed in repeated attacks upon Soviet airfields at Liman, Luskotova and Leninski Bomdardir. On 4 May 1942, the 22¬∫ Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre was withdrawn from active operation. The unit had flown 68 missions, taking part in 19 air combats and 11 ground attack missions. The 22¬∫ Gruppo was credited with 66 destroyed, 16 probables and 45 damaged and awarded a Medaglia d‚Äôargento al valor militare (Silver Medal for military valor). It was replaced by the newly formed 21¬∫ Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre, composed of 356a, 361a, 382a and 386a Squadriglia. This unit, commanded by Maggiore Ettore Foschini, brought new C.202s and 18 new C.200 fighters. During the Second Battle of Kharkov (12‚Äì30 May) the Italians flew escort for the German bombers and reconnaissance aircraft.Neulen 2000, p. 63. In May, the aircraft's pilots received praise from the commander of the German 17th Army, mostly for their daring and effective attacks in the Slavyansk area.Neulen 2000, pp. 63‚Äì64. During the German advance in summer 1942, the 21¬∞ Gruppo Autonomo C.T. transferred to Makeevka airfield, and then to Voroshilovgrad and Oblivskaya. As time went on, the type was increasingly tasked to escort German aircraft. On 24 July 1942, the unit was shifted to Tatsinskaya Airfield, with 24 Saettas. Its main task was to provide escort for Stukas in the Don Bend area, where there were few German fighters available. Hauptmann Friedrich Lang, Staffelk√§pitan of 1./StG 2 reported the Italian escort as \\"most disappointing.\\" The Saettas proved unable to protect the Stukas from Soviet fighters.Bergstr√∂m-Dikov-Antipov- 2006, p. 57. On 25 and 26 July 1942, five C.200s were lost in aerial combat.Neulen 2000, p. 64. After only three days of action from Tatsinskaya, one third of the Italian fighters had been shot down. The following winter, the Soviet counter-offensive resulted in the mass retreat of Axis forces. By early-December 1942, only 32 Saettas were still operating, along with 11 C.202s. However, during the first 18 months of its use on the Eastern front, together with C.202s, the C.200 had claimed an 88 to 15 victory/loss ratio, during which it had performed 1,983 escort missions, 2,557 offensive sweeps, 511 ground support sorties, and 1,310 strafing sorties. Losses grew in the face of a more aggressive enemy flying newer aircraft. The last major action was on 17 January 1943: 25 C.200s strafed enemy troops in the Millerovo area. The aviation of the ARMIR was withdrawn on 18 January, bringing 30 C.200 and nine C.202 fighters back to Italy and leaving 15 unserviceable aircraft behind. A total of 66 Italian aircraft had been lost on Eastern Front ‚Äì against, according to official figures, 88 victories claimed during 17 months of action in that theatre.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 122. The summary of the Italian expeditionary force operations included: 2,557 offensive flights (of which 511 with bombs drops), 1,310 strafing attacks, 1,938 escort missions, with the loss of 15 C.200s. The top scoring unit was 362a Squadriglia commanded by Capitano Germano La Ferla, who claimed 30 Soviet aircraft shot down and 13 destroyed on the ground.de Marchi 1994, p. 8. =After the armistice= Following the signing of the armistice, resulting it Italy's withdrawal from the Axis, only 33 C.200s remained serviceable. Shortly thereafter, 23 Saettas were transferred to Allied airfields in southern Italy, and flown for a short time by pilots of the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force. During mid-1944, the C.200s of Southern Italy were transferred to the Leverano Fighter School; a lack of spare parts had made maintenance increasingly difficult, but the type continued to be used for advanced training up to 1947. A small number of C.200s were also flown by the pro-German National Republican Air Force, based in northern Italy. The latter were only recorded as using the type for a training aircraft, but were not used for operations. Variants The Saetta underwent very few modifications during its service life. Aside from the switch to an open canopy, later aircraft were fitted with an upgraded radio and an armoured seat. Some late-production Saettas were built with the MC.202 Serie VII wing, thus adding two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns to the armament. The four (including two proposed) C.200 derivatives were: ;M.C. 200 (prototypes) :Two prototypes fitted with the 623 kW (840 hp) Fiat a.74 RC 38 radial piston engine. ;M.C. 200 :Single-seat interceptor fighter, fighter- bomber aircraft. Production version. ;M.C.200bis :Breda-proposed modification with a Piaggio P.XIX R.C.45 engine producing 880 kW (1,180 hp) at 4,500 m (14,800 ft). Converted from an early production C.200: first flight 11 April 1942 from Milano-Bresso flown by Luigi Acerbi. The aircraft was then fitted with a larger propeller and a revised engine cowling. Top speed in trials was 535 km/h (332 mph). It did not enter production as the C.200 had been replaced by more advanced designs. ;M.C.200AS :Adapted version to North African Campaign. ;M.C.200CB :Fighter-bomber version with 320 kg (710 lb) of bombs or two external fuel tanks (fighter escort). ;M.C.201 :As an answer to a 5 January 1938 request by the Regia Aeronautica for a C.200 replacement, Aermacchi proposed the C.201, with a revised fuselage, an engine Isotta Fraschini Astro A.140RC.40 (license variant of the French Gnome-et-Rhone GR.14Krs Mistral Major) with 870CV. But later the choice was for the Fiat A.76 R.C.40 engine with 750 kW (1,000 hp). Two prototypes were ordered. The first flew on 10 August 1940, with the less powerful A.74 engine.Sgarlato 2008, p. 19. Although Macchi estimated a top speed of 550 km/h (340 mph), the prototype was cancelled after Fiat abandoned the troublesome A.76 engine.

It was operated mainly by the Regia Aeronautica (RA; Royal (Italian) Air Force) in and around the Second World War. According to aviation author David Mondey, the Folgore has been considered to be one of the best wartime fighters to serve in large numbers with the Regia Aeronautica.Mondey 2006, p. 155. The C.202 was designed by a team headed by the company's chief of design, Italian aeronautics engineer Mario Castoldi. As per company tradition, Macchi aircraft designed by Mario Castoldi received the \\"C\\" letter in their model designation, hence the Folgore is commonly referred to as the C.202 or MC.202. The C.202 was a development of the earlier C.200 Saetta, powered by an Italian-built version of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa engine and featuring a redesigned fuselage for greater streamlining.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 219.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 3-4. During July 1941, the Folgore went into service with the Regia Aeronautica. In combat, it very quickly proved itself to be an effective and deadly dogfighter against its contemporaries.Sgarlato 1998, pp. 8‚Äì20.Winchester 2004, p. 172. During its service life, the C.202 was deployed on all fronts in which Italy was involved.Matricardi 2006, pp. 70‚Äì71. During late 1941, it commenced offensive operations over Malta and in North Africa, where Italian and German forces were engaged in heavy combat against British and later American operations. The C.202 continued to be used in North Africa as late as mid-1943, by which point the type was withdrawn to support defensive efforts in Sicily and the Italian mainland following their invasion by Allied forces. It also saw limited use on the Eastern Front. Following the 1943 Armistice with Italy, the type was mostly used as a trainer aircraft. The type was also operated by Croatia. The Australian ace Clive Caldwell, who fought a wide variety of German, Italian and Japanese fighters during 1941‚Äì45, later stated that the C.202 was \\"one of the best and most undervalued of fighters\\".Dunning 2000, p. 209. The C.202 also had its defects: like its predecessor, the C.200, it could enter a dangerous spin.Duma 2007, pp. 232‚Äì233. The radios were unreliable, routinely forcing pilots to communicate by waggling their wings and Western historians regard the C.202 as insufficiently armed, being furnished with just a pair of machine guns that had a tendency for jamming. Still in mid-Summer 1942, in North Africa, the Folgore achieved a ratio kill/loss better than that of the Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Development =Origins= First Folgore prototype During the 1930s, the Italian military authorities chose to adopt only radial engines to power their aircraft; consequently, during the second half of the 1930s, the Italian aeronautical industry had been sufficiently de-incentivised to the point of completely avoiding the development of more powerful engines based on streamlined liquid-cooled designs, which would become popular abroad.Mondey 2006, p. 153.Cattaneo 1966, p. 3. As a result of this preference, Italian aircraft manufacturer Macchi Aeronautica was forced to rely on the aging Fiat A.74 radial engine to power its C.200 fighter. However, by 1941, the C.200, which was armed with a pair of 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine guns and capable of a maximum speed of 504 km/h (315 mph), was considered to be obsolete in comparison to competitors in production overseas. During July 1939, the Regia Aeronautica requested that Reggiane construct a single prototype Re.2000 that was powered by a German Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa, liquid-cooled supercharged inverted V-12 engine rated at 1,175 PS (1,159 hp, 864 kW); this became the Re.2001. At the time, the most powerful reliable Italian inline engine was the 715 kW (960 hp) Isotta Fraschini Asso XI R.C.40, which was designed in 1936. During November 1939, the Italian automotive company Alfa Romeo acquired a license to produce the DB 601Aa as the Alfa-Romeo RA.1000 R.C.41-I Monsone; it was this engine that was to be used in the production of the C.202. While waiting for domestic production of the engine by Alfa Romeo to ramp up, Aeronautica Macchi decided to import a single DB 601Aa engine; this was initially performed as a private venture without any state support. Macchi chief of design Mario Castoldi commenced work on mating the Macchi C.200 wings, undercarriage, vertical and horizontal tail units to a new fuselage that incorporated the imported DB 601Aa.Gentilli and Gorena 1980, p. 5. During January 1940, formal design work on the new fighter commenced and, shortly thereafter, construction began on a single prototype of the design. Castoldi, whose background included working on Schneider Trophy racers design, followed Celestino Rosatelli as the main designer of new fighters for the RA. His new project was robust and small, utilizing a conventional but complex structural arrangement based on his experience with wooden designs, and at the same time paying great attention to its aerodynamics (Castoldi had previously designed the MC.72, the world's fastest aircraft of its time). =Into flight= On 10 August 1940, less than seven months following the start of design work and two months after Italy's entry into the Second World War, the sole prototype conducted its maiden flight. The prototype differed in some respects from the production aircraft; the headrest fairing incorporated two windows for rear visibility, while production versions replaced this with a narrower, scalloped headrest. The square-sectioned supercharger air intake was replaced by an elongated round sectioned fairing, which was later redesigned to incorporate a dust filter. From the onset of flying trials, it was evident that the C.202 was an advanced design for the era, owing much of its performance to the use of the Daimler Benz DB 601, which represented a departure from the standard practice of using engines of Italian origin. Revised and camouflaged C.202 prototype from the rear, showing the three-bladed propeller and wing profile Following its initial flights, the prototype was flown to the Regia Aeronauticas main test airfield at Guidonia, where it reportedly met with an enthusiastic response from test pilots. A speed of 603 km/h (375 mph) was recorded during testing, while an altitude of 5,486 m (18,000 ft) was attained within the space of six minutes; in addition, little of the favourable manoeuvrability of the earlier C.200 had been lost. Another of its positive attributes was its extremely strong construction, which allowed its pilots to dive the aircraft steeply.Caruana 1996, p. 175. The performance figures gathered during these tests indicated that Italy had caught up with both Britain and Germany in the field of fighter airplanes. As a result of the favourable flight test reports, the C.202 was immediately ordered into production; the first examples (built by Macchi as Serie II) appearing in May 1941. However, the complexity of the structure was not well suited to mass production, and resulted in a relatively limited production rate. According to aviation author Giuseppe Ciampaglia, in comparison to the Bf 109E/F, which was rated at typically requiring 4,500‚Äì6,000 man-hours per aircraft to complete, the Macchi routinely needed in excess of 22,000 man-hours.Ciampaglia 1994, p. 79. The growth of the C.202 project was slower than that of the rival Re. 2001 effort; but, by employing both mass production techniques and less expensive advanced technologies, the production cost was slightly less than that of the Reggiane Re.2001, (525,000 lire vs 600,000); this latter, the only other DB 601 fighter in mass production, was slower and heavier (2.460/3.240 kg)Sgarlato 2005, p. 28. but had a bigger wing and a more advanced and adaptable structure.Sgarlato, Nico. Reggiane. Lu-August 2005, pp. 26‚Äì27. In order to expand production, the Milan-based industrial manufacturer Societ√† Italiana Ernesto Breda was selected to also construct the C.202. Breda would eventually produce the majority of the type.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 3, 5. SAI- Ambrosini, based in Passignano sul Trasimeno, also served as another sub- contractor on the C.202, ultimately building around 100 fighters of the type.Gentilli and Gorena 1980, pp. 5, 7. For some time, supplies of the DB 601 engine continued to be provided directly from Germany in order to supplement Italian production. Throughout the type's production life, manufacturing was near-permanently constrained by the limited availability of the engine.Cattaneo 1966, p. 12. Design The nose of a Macchi C.202D The Macchi C.202 Folgore was an Italian fighter aircraft, developed from the earlier C.200 Saetta; its principal difference was its use of an Italian-built version of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa engine and the adoption of a revised streamlined fuselage. Both the wing and fuselage structures were of a conventional metal design, having a single vertical tail with two elevators, and a wing of relatively conventional design with two main spars and 23 ribs. The ailerons, elevators and rudder were metal structures with fabric covering. Apart from the ailerons, the entire trailing edge of the wing was dominated by a pair of all metal split flaps. The undercarriage was of a standard design; the two widely set hydraulically-actuated main gears retracted inwardly into recesses set into the wing, while the tail wheel was non-retractable. The fuselage of the C.202 was a semi-monocoque shell, comprising four light-alloy beams, complete with longerons and ovoidal bulkheads. It was significantly streamlined over the preceding C.200 to increase performance by reducing the parasitic drag encountered. The forward section housed both the main armament and the Alfa Romeo RA.1000 R.C.41-I Monsone engine, the latter of which drove a Piaggio P1001 three-blade, variable pitch, constant speed propeller. As with the C.200, to counteract the torque of the engine, Castoldi extended the left wing by 21 cm (8.5 inches); this meant that the left wing developed more lift, offsetting the tendency of the aircraft to roll to the left due to the rotation of the propeller. The wing was a bi-longeron structure, which was attached to the fuselage center section via steel forgings; it was fitted with flaps that were both statically and dynamically balanced. The main coolant radiator was housed in a rectangular fairing under the fuselage beneath the cockpit, and the oil cooler was placed under the nose within a streamlined, rectangular housing. From the cockpit aft, the fuselage was formed into a round monocoque structure; the aft fuselage tapered into the tail and contained the radio, oxygen and flight control mechanisms. The canopy was hinged on the starboard base and opened sideways. Behind the canopy, the pilot's headrest was fixed to a triangular turn-over pylon which was covered by a streamlined, tapered fairing.Cattaneo 1966, p. 4. This fairing was shaped into an inverted 'T' which enabled the pilot to have a reasonable field of view to the rear. The unpressurised cockpit had an armor plate fitted behind the armored seat for protection. While early C.202s had a very short \\"stub\\" radio mast projecting from the fairing, most used a tall, slim mast. Situated behind the engine and under the 12.7 mm (.5 in) ammunition boxes there was a single 270 L (71.3 US gal) fuel tank; all tanks were of the self-sealing variety. Another 80 L (21.1 US gal) fuel tank was placed behind the pilot, along with a pair of additional tanks, each with a capacity of 40 L (10.5 US gal), being housed in the wing roots; the total fuel capacity was 430 L (113.6 US gal). Jettisonable tanks, containing either 22 or 33 gallons of fuel, could be installed upon some of the later built aircraft. A Macchi C.202 in flight Initially, all the armament was fitted within the nose of the Macchi. Ammunition carried was up to 800 rounds (standard: 700 rounds).Cattaneo 1966, pp. 4-5. An additional pair of Breda 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns was fitted in the wings in the VII series onward, but these, along with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, added 100 kg (220 lb) to the aircraft's weight and were typically removed by pilots to save weight, since they were relatively ineffective against most enemy aircraft in 1942.Sgarlato 1998, p. 33. A synchronizing unit allowed the nose guns to fire through the propeller disk, but with a 25% loss in ROF (Rate of Fire).Ghergo 2006, p. 12. A \\"San Giorgio\\" reflector gun sight was fitted. Australian air ace Clive Caldwell felt the Folgore would have been superior to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 had it been better armed.Ethell and Christy 1979, p. 51. The C.202 was lightly armed by the standards of the time carrying the same armament as the C.R.32, a 1933 design.Williams and Gustin 2003, p. 107. The C.202 carried as standard two 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns. The Breda design was as heavy as the Browning M2, the model from which it was derived. The Breda fired 12.7x81 mm \\"Vickers\\" ammunition ‚Äî while its cartridges were longer than the 13 x 64 mm rounds of its German rough equivalent, the MG 131, the 81 mm Italian rounds were still shorter than the standard 12.7x99 mm rounds of the American \\"Ma Deuce\\"; with the result that the energy at the muzzle was 10,000 joules vs. 16,000. The rate of fire was about 18 rounds/second (1,080 rounds per minute) or 0.63 kg (1.39 lb).Massimello, Giorgio. La caccia italiana 1940‚Äì43, p. 11. A C.202 on display at the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum, Washington D.C. On 21 August 1941, Tenente Giulio Reiner, one of the most skillful and experienced pilots of 9¬∞ Gruppo, flew the \\"military control flight\\" in Lonate Pozzolo, The Ufficio tecnico (Technical Bureau) recorded the maximum speed of 1,078.27 km/h in the Folgore in a vertical dive, with 5.8 G. forces while pulling out of the dive. Ingegner Mario Castoldi, the designer of the 202 questioned whether Reiner had properly flown the test. In fact, during the vertical dive, Reiner had to face very strong vibrations throughout the airframe and in the control stick, while the flying controls were locked and the propeller blades were jammed at maximum pitch. The clean aerodynamics offered by the inline engine permitted dive speeds high enough for pilots to encounter the then-unknown phenomenon of compressibility.Cattaneo 1971, . The empty weight of the new C.202 (approximately 2,350 kg/5,180 lb) gradually increased throughout production, and due to the thickness of metal used it was also comparatively heavy, yet this class of aircraft was still considered lightweight compared to other contemporary fighter designs. The Macchi's mass was around 300 kg (660 lb) higher than the comparable Bf 109E German fighter, consequently, the power-to- weight ratio was considerably lower while wing loading was higher.Marcon, Tullio. \\"P-40.\\" Storia Militare, January 2001. p. 21, gives a ratio of 2.1 kg/hp for the Bf 109, 2.5 for the MC.202, 2.1 for the Spitfire VC and 3.3 for the P-40E. The relatively high diving speed of the type has been attributed to the exceptionally clean design of its fuselage. According to military history author Antonio Duma, some of the defects present on the new fighter could have been easily resolved, such as a tendency for the landing gear to inadvertently lower when pulling out of a steep dive, a machine gun bonnet that often broke, frequent jamming of the ammunition belts and, caused by vibrations generated by the engine, the rapid crystallizing and eventual shearing of the air cleaner intake. Other defects, like the unreliability of the radio sets and of the oxygen systems, and the limited armament, could not be addressed with such ease.Duma 2007, p. 217. However, different sets of radio sets and accompanying antenna were installed upon some aircraft.Cattaneo 1966, p. 5.

During 1940, the Folgore was put into production using imported DB 601Aa engines, while Alfa Romeo set up production of the engine under license as the RA.1000 R.C.41-I Monsone (Monsoon). Due to initial delays in engine production, Macchi resorted to completing some C.202 airframes as C.200s, powered by Fiat-built radial engines. Nevertheless, by late 1942, Folgores outnumbered all other fighter aircraft in the Regia Aeronautica. The first units selected to be equipped with the C.202 Series I were the 17¬∞ and 6¬∞ Gruppi, from 1¬∞ Stormo, based at the airfield of Campoformido, near Udine, and the 9¬∞ Gruppo of 4¬∞ Stormo, based in Gorizia. Their pilots started to train on the new fighter in May‚ÄìJune 1941, at Lonate Pozzolo (Varese), the airfield of the Macchi.Malizia 2002, pp. 92‚Äì93. Although first deployed in mid-1941, the C.202 did not see action until later that autumn; this delay came as a consequence of the many defects that were discovered upon the first fighter deliveries. Some defects appeared similar to those on the early C. 200 version: on 3 August, during a mock dogfight, Sergente Maggiore Antonio Valle ‚Äì an experienced pilot, credited with two kills in Marmarica and recipient of a Medaglia di Bronzo al Valor Militare (Bronze Medal of Military Valor) ‚Äì at a height of 4,000 meters entered in a flat spin and could not recover or bail out, losing his life.Duma 2007, pp. 216‚Äì217. The oxygen system was also regarded as being inefficient, causing, at least during the first sorties, up to 50/60 per cent of the pilots to abandon their missions and in some cases having been determined to have caused fatal accidents. By November 1941, the C.202 had appeared on the Libyan front. However, according to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, the type may have been more of a hindrance than help in that theatre, attributing this to the pilots flying it only being semi-trained, which was in turn caused by the type being rushed into service as Axis air superiority had faded in North Africa, and a lack of spares to maintain it with. The C.202 had a better time on the home front, where supplies were more plentiful and units had more time to prepare and familiarise themselves with the type.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 5-6. The type was quickly put to use outside of North Africa, seeing limited service against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front where, between 1941 and 1943, together with C.200s, the fighter reportedly achieved an 88 to 15 victory/loss ratio.Cattaneo 1966, p. 8. However, according to authors Jeffery Ethell and Pietro Tonizzo, that ratio refers only to the C.200 \\"Saetta\\".Ethell 1996, p. 69.De Marchi, Italo ‚Äì Tonizzo, Pietro. Macchi MC. 200 / FIAT CR. 32. Modena, Edizioni Stem Mucchi 1994, p. 10. =Malta= A C.202 in flight, circa 1941 The Folgore first saw service during the Siege of Malta on 29 or 30 September 1941; their first mission was the interception of British Hurricanes over Sicily.Duma 2007, p. 223.Malizia 2002, p. 95. From early October 1941, the Italian units commenced extensive operations over Malta, which provided many opportunities for encounters with RAF fighters. From its initial combat missions, the C.202 displayed marked superiority over the Hawker Hurricane II, which formed the island's main form of aerial defence at the time.Caruana 1999, p. 175. However, the Macchi's main weakness, its weak armament, proved to be a problem even at this stage.Skulski 2012, p. 25. Over the skies of the besieged island, the new Macchi fighter was not only used to conduct fighter operations, but also for performing ground attack runs and aerial reconnaissance missions. Among the pilots who flew recce C.202s on Malta was Adriano Visconti, later to become a famed ace and credited with at least 10 air victories.Skulski 2012, p. 25. The presence of the Folgores in Maltese skies was to last only until the end of November, when most of the unit was transferred to the deteriorating North Africa front. The 4¬∞ Stormo returned to Sicily at the beginning of April 1942, with 10¬∫ Gruppo, to Castelvetrano. The airport was already the base of Gruppi 7¬∫ and 16¬∫ from 54¬∫ Stormo equipped with some C.202s besides the Macchi C.200s and Fiat CR.42s.Duma 2007, p. 267. The 4¬∞ Stormo C.202s flew the first sortie, on 21 April, claiming a Spitfire V, while escorting three more \\"recce\\" Macchis from 54¬∫ Stormo.Duma 2007, p. 268. The 4¬∫ Stormo flew its last mission on Malta on 19 May before moving back to North Africa.Duma 2007, p. 277.Cattaneo 1966, p. 6. In the meantime, the 16¬∞ Gruppo had started to re-equip with the C.202s at the end of 1941. During May 1942, the Macchis of 51¬∞ Stormo and 23¬∞ Gruppo (3¬∞ Stormo) also arrived.Caruana 1999, pp. 175-177. During Operation Harpoon, one of two simultaneous Allied convoys sent to supply Malta in the Axis-dominated central Mediterranean Sea in mid-June 1942, C.202s were involved in clashing with Sea Hurricanes. However, it was during this time that the Axis had to abandon their plans for the invasion of Malta (known as Operation C 3) due to the aircraft and men being necessary elsewhere. On 7 March 1942, the carrier delivered the first Spitfires to Malta, and the Axis' air-superiority started to shift in favour of the Allies.Shores et al. 1991, pp. 106‚Äì110. At the end of June, however, about 60 C.202s could be mustered in Sicily to operate against Malta, which had been receiving the Spitfire Mk. V in ever-increasing quantities.Caruana 1999, pp. 175‚Äì177. The Macchi could out-turn the Spitfire, but the Folgores suffered from the lack of a more powerful armament and, without radios, the Regia Aeronautica pilots were forced to communicate with one another by waggling their wings and, consequently, had to adopt formations that were too tight and less effective in combat. Their performance had also suffered due to the lack of radar, which the RAF were making extensive use of to successfully vector their fighters against their aerial opposition.Beurling with Roberts 1943, pp. 165‚Äì166. Nevertheless, the C.202's pilots were able to achieve many successes against the British Spitfires. The top scoring Italilan pilots in this theatre included Capitano Furio Niclot-Doglio (a 7 kills ace, shot down and killed on 27 July 1942 by RAF ace George \\"Screwball\\" Beurling) and Sergente Ennio Tarantola. Both pilots flew with 51¬∞ Stormo C.T., the most successful Italian unit over Malta, having reportedly achieved a score of 97 aircraft destroyed for the loss of only 17 Folgores.Skulski 2012, p. 29. 151 Gruppo unit photo with MC.202 =North Africa and Pantelleria= A C.202 in Africa, 1942 On 29 July 1941, the three first operational C.202s of 4¬∞ Stormo, 97¬™ Squadriglia, landed at Merna airport.Duma 2007, p. 215. On 26 November, during Operation Crusader, 19 Macchis of 9¬∞ Gruppo, 4¬∞ Stormo were sent to Africa, and by the end of the month the whole 1¬∞ Stormo was in Libya, both units taking part in the last stages of the British offensive that led to the raising of the siege of Tobruk, and the retreat of Italian and German troops in Cyrenaica in December.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 6-7. During its initial combats over the Western Desert, the Folgore was quite a surprise to British pilots and it remained a respected adversary.Ethell 1995, p. 71. Squadron Leader Dennis Harry Clark, D.F.C. and A.F.C., in his book \\"What were they like to fly\\" (1964), stated: \\"Sleek, supremely fast (..) the 202 was capable of out- turning our P-40s with ease; but the majority would pull away effortlessly into a climbing roll off or a roll off the top when things became at all hectic... Their aircraft was superior to ours on all counts.\\" In the desert war, incursions by the SAS behind enemy lines were often aimed at destroying aircraft on the ground. Macchi 202s of 1¬∞ Stormo based at Uadi Tamet had been transferred from Italy one month before and recently relocated from Bir el Merduma because the airbase was too exposed to SAS attacks. 1¬∞ Stormo had 60 fighters, 17¬∞Gruppo around 30. In a month of combat, the latter lost a total of eight fighters to raids. On the night of 28 December 1941 the SAS managed to destroy a further nine aircraft. After this attack the Italians were forced to move their remaining aircraft well away from the front lines to avoid incurring further losses to such raids.Massimello, Giorgio. \\"Il SAS e la R.A.\\" Storia Militare, February 2008, pp. 9‚Äì10. During 1942, Bf 109F/Gs and Macchi C.202s fought against the Allied air forces in North Africa. At the time of Rommel's offensive on Tobruk, 5¬™ \\"Squadra Aerea\\" (\\"Aviation Corps\\"), based in North Africa, had three Macchi wings: 1¬∞ Stormo had 47 C.202s (40 serviceable), 2¬∞ Stormo had 63 C.200s (52) while 4¬∞ Stormo had 57(47). This, coupled with the 32 Cant Z.1007s, was one of the most powerful fighter forces that the Italians fielded in the war, and constituted almost a tenth of the overall Folgore production. During April 1942 the 4¬∞ Stormo solved the frequent problems to the oxygen masks by adopting the German Dr√§ger \\"oxygen apparatus\\" that already equipped the Bf 109s.Duma 2007, pp. 271. Tripoli- Castel Benito Airport, Tripoli, Libya, early 1943 During the Battle of Bir Hakeim the C.202s performed successfully against the assorted fighters of the Desert Air Force, typically using \\"dive and zoom\\" tactics, similar to those of Luftwaffe fighters. In the morning of 26 May, about 60 Folgore from 1¬∞ and 4¬∞ Stormo attacked Gambut airfield destroying and damaging many Allied aircraft surprised while taking off.Emiliani, Ghergo, Vigna 1979, p. 111. Even if often outnumbered, the C.202s achieved 22 confirmed air victories against Hurricanes and P-40s for the loss of just five of their number, a kill/loss ratio of 4,4/1, bettering the Bf 109s' (3,5/1). On 23 December 1942, the Regia Aeronautica authorized the use of under-wing jettisonable tanks on the C.202s of 6¬∞ and 7¬∞ Gruppo based in Pantelleria, significantly boosting their endurance.Borgiotti 1994, p. 3. By the end of the year, the growing strength of the Allied forces was overwhelming and after the defeat in the skies over Malta as well as El-Alamein the last operational Axis units lost their air superiority in the Mediterranean.Cattaneo 1966, p. 7. The Germans and the Italians succeeded in establishing a bridgehead in Tunisia, and later in December the Regia Aeronautica transferred four fighter squadrons there; the 5¬™ Squadra Aerea, which had left Libya and retreated to Tunisia, had previously repatriated all unserviceable aircraft to Italy. By early 1943, Regia Aeronautica had only 54 serviceable C.202 across 12 squadrons.Skulski 2012, p. 36. By 21 February 1943 the 5¬™ Squadra Aerea still had the 6¬∞Gruppo C.T. with three squadrons of C.202s at Sfax and Gammarth in the northern sector, and in the southern sector, 3¬∞Stormo with six squadrons of C.200s and C.202s at El Hamma. Although these forces were insufficient they nevertheless achieved notable successes. On 6‚Äì7 March 1943, C.202 pilots claimed 19 RAF and two USAAF aircraft, for the loss of two Folgore.Skulski 2012, p. 36. Pilots of 16¬∞ Gruppo Assalto, an attack unit, downed no fewer than 10 aircraft.Skulski 2012, p. 37. The Macchis continued fighting while retreating to Tunisia and then in the defence of Sicily, Sardinia and Italy against an increasingly stronger opponent. The Macchis of two groups at Korba were forced to concentrate 40 C.202s (both 7¬∞ and 16¬∞, 54¬∞ Stormo), and on 8 May 1943, almost all their C.202s were destroyed on the ground by marauding Spitfires.Massiniello 1996 Only eleven aircraft were repaired by 10 May 1943 and retreated to Italy. Because no transport aircraft were available every surviving fighter had two men inside, a pilot and a mechanic. At least one was destroyed and the two crewmen wounded after crash-landing on a beach near Reggio Calabria. During the Tunisian operation the Regia Aeronautica lost a total of 22 C.202s in the air and 47 on the ground.Skulski 2012, p. 37. Pilots of the 51 Stormo C.T. North Africa. Many of these pilots never returned - Gelli =Eastern Front operations= During May 1942, the 22¬∞ Gruppo Caccia, that had reached its operational limit, was replaced by the newly formed 21¬∞ Gruppo Autonomo C.T. composed of 356¬™, 382¬™, 361¬™ and 386¬™ Squadriglia. This unit, commanded by Maggiore (Major) Ettore Foschini, brought new C.202s and 18 new Macchi C.200 fighters.Neulen 2000, p. 63. During August 1942, at the beginning of the German offensive, they were deployed at the Stalino, Lughansk, Kantemirovka and Millerovo airfields, typically performing ground attack strikes against the Red Army positions along the east Don river during October‚ÄìNovember 1942. In this theatre, the fighters were operated under adverse climate conditions (40¬∞ to 45¬∞ below zero and heavy snow storms) as well as frequently coming under heavy harassment from Russian fighter-bombers. As a consequence of these operational circumstances, 21¬∞ Gruppo ‚Äì which had 17 C.202s on strength ‚Äì were rarely able to conduct sorties; as such, only a total of 17 missions were flown with Folgores on the Eastern Front during a four-month period.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 98. When they were able to conduct combat operations, the C.202 were frequently flown as escorts alongside their older C.200 siblings for Fiat BR.20M and Caproni Ca.311 bombers in attacks against Soviet columns, during which they would typically be facing aerial opposition from great numbers of Soviet Air Forces (VVS) fighters. The C.202 were also regularly used to escort CANT Z.1007bis during the latter's reconnaissance missions, as well as for German transport aircraft. During one such mission, on 11 December 1942, which involved the escorting of several Junkers Ju 52s en route to Stalingrad, Tenente Pilota Gino Lionello was shot down and forced to bail out from his Folgore.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 98. After the abandonment of advanced airfields between December 1942 ‚Äì January 1943 at Voroshilovgrad, Stalino and Tscerkow, the Italian air units were operated in a series of defensive actions against a more potent Soviet air offensive, consisting mainly of Ilyushin IL-2s Shturmoviks and Petlyakov Pe-2s. During March 1943, the Corpo Aereo Italiano was detached to Odessa airbase, joining Reggiane Re. 2000 H√©ja I of the Hungarian MKHL 1 and 2/1 Vad√°szsz√°zad, as well as IAR 80C and Bf 109E/G of Romanian FARR 4 and 5 detached at the same base and Saki (Crimea) in a holding action against the VVS armada of 2,000 aircraft, at a time when the Axis air forces only countered with 300 operative aircraft, which were further constrained by having very small quantities of fuel, munitions and equipment available. On 17 January 1943, the last effective operation of Corpo Aereo Italiano in Russia occurred, when a single mixed formation of 25 surviving Macchi fighters (out of a remaining total of 30 C.200s and nine C.202s) attacked several Red Army armored and motorized infantry columns in support of German and Italian units that were encircled in Millerovo.De Marchi 1994, p. 10. =Sicilian and Italian campaigns= A Macchi C.202 at Wright-Patterson Field outside Dayton, Ohio, for United States Army Air Forces evaluation. The aircraft had been captured in Italy during the Italian campaign of World War II. The C.202s played a significant role in the defense of Sicily and Southern Italy against bombing attacks launched by the USAAF, however, by the time of Allied invasion of Sicily during July 1943, their effectiveness had been diminished considerably as a result of attrition, which had reduced the number available.Mondey 2006, p. 155.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 8-9. Furthermore, it was increasingly recognised that 20 mm cannons were required in order to cause enough damage, thus a mixture of Bf 109F/Gs, Macchi MC.205s and Fiat G.55s were deployed to replace the remaining C.202s as soon as possible. Mixed units (such as the 51¬∞ Stormo, Sardinia) were formed with C.202s, yet were often serving with C.205s as well. By the signing of the 1943 Armistice with Italy, there were only 186 Folgores remaining, of which roughly 100 aircraft were still considered to be in a serviceable condition.Sgarlato, Macchi 202, p. 38.Cattaneo 1966, p. 9. Several C.202s served with the Allied- aligned Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, and some of these were subsequently reconstructed into C.205s or C.202/205 with the Veltro's engine. Others served as trainers in the Axis-aligned Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana (National Republican Air Force) of the Italian Social Republic (RSI) and the Luftwaffe (German Air Force).Cattaneo 1966, pp. 9-10. =Folgore aces= The Macchi C.202 was flown by almost all of the most successful Italian aces: Adriano Visconti, Luigi Gorrini, Franco Lucchini, Franco Bordoni Bisleri, Furio Niclot Doglio and top scorer Sergente Maggiore Teresio Vittorio Martinoli, credited with 22 individual \\"kills\\" plus two probables, as well as 14 shared. Seventeen of these victories were obtained in 73¬™ Squadriglia, 9¬∞ Gruppo (from 4¬∞ Stormo). On 25 August 1944, Martinoli was killed during a training flight with the P-39 Airacobra. Capitano Franco Lucchini, who was credited with 21/26 individual victories and 52 shared, began to fly the Folgore after having already shot down 10 enemy aircraft. On 5 July 1943, Lucchini was killed in his C.202 while attacking a B-17 over Gerbini, Sicily. =In Croatian service= About 20‚Äì22 Macchi C.202s were flown by Croatia, who typically operated them in the interceptor role against Allied bombers.Skulski 2012, p. 57. During 1944, the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr≈æave Hrvatske (ZNDH), received several batches of C.202s. During January, eight brand-new Folgore fighters arrived at Zagreb's Lucko airfield. Two weeks later, another four aircraft arrived; one of these was reportedly lost during a test-flight. The first batch of 16 \\"Folgores\\" delivered to the ZNDH was from the XII series, built by Breda following the German occupation of Northern Italy. These fighters equipped Kroat. JGr 1 and retained their Luftwaffe markings whilst in service with the unit. During 1944, the Croatian Air Force Legion (HZL) fighter squadron had returned to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front. Upon its return, the HZL was redesignated Kroat. JGr 1, while its operational fighter squadron was redesignated 2./(Kroat.)JGr; this unit was equipped with Macchis. A second training / operational conversion squadron was also formed, designated 3./(Kroat.)JGr and equipped with Fiat G.50, Macchi C.200 and Fiat CR.42 fighters. During March 1944, they were scrambled for the first time against an American raid west of Zagreb, but combat was avoided: Croatian Macchi pilots had been initially instructed to attack only those aircraft which had already been damaged or had become separated from their main formations.Savic & Ciglic 2002, p. 63. On 24 April 1944, the first confirmed air victory was claimed by Unteroffizier Leopold Hrastovcan against an American B-24 that was shot down near the village of Zapresic (Zagorje). According to some sources, during these first sorties, Croat C.202s claimed between 11 and 16 aerial victories, but only three further were confirmed. During May 1944, the Croatians received four C.202s from the Luftwaffe in Ni≈°, Serbia; during the ferry flight, a single Macchi crash landed near Zemun airfield. Around June 1944, the Croat unit received the last six Folgore and three or four brand new Macchi C.205s.Savic and Ciglic 2002, p. 64. Irrespective of the Croatian Air Force Legion having been disbanded at the end of July, after which it was replaced by the Croatian Air Force Group (HZS), the fighters themselves remained at Borovo. During a period of intensive activity over the summer, the squadron had claimed some 20 Allied aircraft shot down. At the end of the summer, those C.202s that were still in a flight-worthy condition, based in Borovo, were used by Croatian cadets for training purposes. During September 1944, Luftwaffe pilots flew all of the remaining airworthy Folgores to Borongaj, where they were used only for training. According to aviation authors Dragan Savic and Boris Ciglic, Croatian pilots did not at first have a high opinion of the Macchi fighter, in part due to its armament consisting of just a pair of 12.7 mm and two 7.7mm machine guns, which were regarded as scarcely effective against the heavily armed US four-engined bombers. Eastern front veteran Major Josip Helebrant, an 11-kill flying aceSavic and Ciglic 2002, p. 82. (used to flying Bf 109Gs) and the CO of 2./(Kroat.)JGr, had reportedly initially regarded the Macchis as \\"old, weary and unusable\\", and described the morale of his men as \\"low\\", and his unit's results as \\"nil\\", primarily because of the NDH's underdeveloped air-raid warning system, which saw the Croatian Macchi fighters often taking off to intercept attacking Allied bombers that were already flying overhead.Savic and Ciglic 2002, p. 63. =Postwar service= As a consequence of the Allied aerial bombing against the Italian Social Republic, during which the manufacturing facilities of the Macchi company had sustained damage during 1944, both the production life and combat career of both the C.202 and the further refined C.205 were effectively cut short and greatly diminished. Post-war, some of the aircraft which had survived the conflict were joined by a small number of newly manufactured C.205s. The surviving aircraft were operated by the Aeronautica Militare Italiana, where they were used as trainer aircraft as late as 1948 before being phased out entirely. The Royal Egyptian Air Force ordered a total of 42 C.205s, but 31 of these were in fact re-engined Folgores (C.202s), armed with only a pair of 12.7 mm Breda machine guns. Some of these aircraft later fought during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War the State of Israel; the Egyptian fighters were reportedly still in service as late as 1951.Sgarlato 1998, pp. 41‚Äì45. Switzerland had placed an order for 20 C.202s, however, none of these were ever delivered; this was due to the deteriorating war situation at the time (May 1943) that meant that Italy no longer had the capability to export these types of aircraft.Sgarlato 1998, p. 40.Savic and Ciglic 2002 During mid-1944, at least 12 C.202s, and probably another 12 aircraft, were delivered to the Croatian Air Force Legion for operational use against the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces over Croatia, all of which being ex-LW fighters. Those allied pilots who flew against the Folgore were frequently impressed with its performance and manoeuvrability.Spick 1997, p. 117. The C.202 was often considered to have been superior to both the British Hawker Hurricane and the American Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk that it commonly fought against, at first on the Libyan front, as well as being the equal of the Supermarine Spitfire Mk. V. The C.202 was able to out-turn all three, although the Spitfire possessed a superior rate of climb.Glancey 2007, pp. 165‚Äì166. The C.202 could effectively fly against the Hurricane, Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Curtiss P-40 and even the Spitfire at low altitudes, but the aircraft's combat effectiveness was somewhat hampered by its weak armament. Variants and production Like its predecessor C.200, the C.202 had relatively few modifications, with only 116 modifications during its career, most of them invisible, externally. The total series production ordered was 1,454: 900 to Breda, 150 to SAI Ambrosini, 403 to Aermacchi. The amount produced was actually 1,106 and not 1,220 as previous stated. Breda built 649 (Series XVI deleted, Series XII and XV partially completed caused the difference); Aermacchi made 390 examples, SAI only 67.Sgarlato 2008 One of the differences between prototype and series production was the lack of radio antenna and the retractable tailwheel (these differences resulting in a slightly higher top speed); the difference in speed was not so great and so, the series version had the fixed tailwheel and the radio antenna. The support for the engine, originally steel, was replaced with a lighter aluminium structure.Sgarlato Nico, Folgore Monography Feb 2008 ;C.202 : Starting with the Serie VII, the fighter had a new wing with a provision for two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns and an armored windscreen (previously, only the armored seat and the self-sealing tanks were provided). Serie IX's weight was 2,515/3,069 kg with the 7.7 machine guns seldom installed.Sgarlato 2008, p. 36. ;C.202AS :Dust filters for operations in North Africa (AS ‚Äì Africa Settentrionale, North Africa); they little affected the speed and so, almost all Folgores had them and thus were in C.202AS standard; finally, starting with Serie XI there was a provision for two 50, 100 or 160 kg bombs, small bombs clusters (10, 15, 20 kg) or 100 l drop tanks. These underwing pylons were rarely utilized, as Folgores were needed in the interceptor roles.Sgarlato 2008, p. 29. ;C.202CB :Underwing hardpoints for bombs or drop tanks (CB ‚Äì Caccia Bombardiere, Fighter-Bomber) ;C.202EC :Likely standing for Esperimento Cannoni, it was another link between Veltro and Folgore. One aircraft (Serie III, s/n MM 91974) was fitted with a pair of gondola-mounted 20 mm cannon with 200 rounds each (it flew on 12 May 1943); later it was turned into a C.205V. Another four examples were so equipped, but, despite the good results in the trials (aimed to boost the Folgore's firepower), there was no further production, because the cannons penalized the aircraft's performance. There was, in the Folgore, no room to mount them inside the wings or the nose, so the MC.205V/Ns was developed. Nevertheless, the XII series could have introduced a new wing with MG 151 provisions. This is not well documented, as this series was produced by Breda after the Armistice, and was interrupted with the devastating USAAF bombings, together with many other aircraft; among them, also Macchi 205 production and the 206 prototype (30 April 1944; in five days, the USAAF destroyed both Fiat and Macchi facilities, eliminating all of Italy's fighter production).Sgarlato Nico. I caccia Serie 5 Monography, March 2009, pp. 16, 30, 43. ;C.202RF :Equipped with cameras for photo-reconnaissance missions (R ‚Äì Ricognizione, Reconnaissance), very few produced, later the recce role was covered by Veltros.Sgarlato 2008, p. 37. ;C.202D :Prototype with a revised radiator, under the nose, similar to the P-40 (s/n. MM 7768) ;C.202 AR.4 :At least one such aircraft was modified to server as a \\"drone director\\" (coupled with S.79s), and it was planned to use Folgores also as 'Mistel', with an AR.4 \\"radiobomba\\" (a form of remote-control kamikaze bomber). ;C.202 with DB 605 and other engines :Macchi MC.202 with DB 605 were initially known as MC.202 bis; later as the C.205 Veltro. Macchi C.200, C.202 and C.205 shared many common components. The MC.200A/2 was a MC.200 with Folgore wings (MM.8238). After the Armistice, Aeronautica Sannita or the Co-Belligerent Italian AF began MC.205 modifying C.202s with DB 605s. These aircraft were known also as Folgeltro. Around two dozen were made. Another Folgore was modified with DB 601E-1 (1,350 PS) in summer 1944, but this hybrid with Bf 109F technology crashed on 21 January 1946. The MC.204 was a version with a L.121 Asso (1,000 hp); proposed early in the war (28 September 1940), but all the effort continued only with DB 601 engines. Early Folgores had original DB 601s, while from the Serie VII, RC.41s were available. After the war, 31 C.202 airframes were fitted with license-built Daimler-Benz DB 605 engines and sold to Egypt as C.205 Veltros, with another 11 'real' MC.205s (with MG 151 cannons in the wings).

Along with the Reggiane Re.2005 and Fiat G.55, the Macchi C.205 was one of the three \\"Serie 5\\" Italian fighters built around the powerful Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine. The C.205 was a development of the earlier C.202 Folgore. With a top speed of some and equipped with a pair of 20 mm cannon as well as 12.7 mm Breda machine guns, the Macchi C.205 Veltro was highly respected by Allied and Axis pilots alike. Widely regarded as one of the best Italian aircraft of World War II, it proved to be extremely effective, destroying a large number of Allied bombers.Mondey 2006, p. 256. The Macchi C. 205 proved capable of meeting fighters such as the North American P-51D Mustang on equal terms, which encouraged the Luftwaffe to use a number of these aircraft to equip one Gruppe.Mondey 2006, p. 158. While the C.205 was able to match the best Allied opponents in speed and manoeuvrability, it was introduced late in the conflict. Due to the limitations of the Italian war economy, only a small production run was delivered before the end of the war. Like the Spitfire, the Veltro was tricky in its construction and slow to build.Glancey 2006, pp. 166‚Äì168. Italy's highest scoring ace, Adriano Visconti, achieved 11 of his 26 credited victories in the few weeks he was able to fly the Veltro, with the top scoring Sergente Maggiore pilota Luigi Gorrini shooting down 14 enemy aircraft plus six damaged with the C.205.Sgarlato 1998, pp. 8‚Äì20. Design and development In 1941, seeking to further improve the performance of the C.202 fighter, the Regia Aeronautica decided to license-build the German DB 605 1,100 kW (1,475 hp) liquid-cooled supercharged inverted V-12 engine in Italy, which Fiat produced as the RA.1050 R.C.58 Tifone (Typhoon). Fighter manufacturers were invited to enter versions of their designs using this engine as the caccia della serie 5 (\\"series-5 fighter\\") and were provided with imported DB 605s for prototype use. All of the designs used the number 5 in the name, with the Macchi becoming the C.205 (instead of C.202bis or C.203). Macchi had used a licence-built DB 601 engine in the C.202, an engine which was closely comparable in size to the later, more powerful DB 605. This meant that the C.202 airframe could be easily adapted for the DB 605. The C.205V Veltro first flew on 19 April 1942, and was considered a stop-gap measure with the definitive variant being the 205N Orione (N stood for \\"new\\").Massiniello 1997 In testing, the Fiat G.55 Centauro and Re.2005 Sagittario proved to be better performers at high altitude due to their larger wing area. In fact, the Veltro used the same wing as the earlier Folgore but its weight had increased from to and the wing loading from 140 kg/m2 to 153.6 kg/m2. The Veltros performance was similar to German designs with their higher wing loading, and was at its best at medium altitudes where it could reach 642 km/h (399 mph). The C.205 Veltro was placed in production until the G.55 and the Re.2005 could become available. The first 100 Veltro Serie I were only machine-gun-armed, but many were also fitted with the 20 mm MG 151 cannon. There were no Serie II built, but 150 Serie III were ordered, which were fitted with wing cannons as a standard. The necessity to re-engineer the forward fuselage was time-consuming but, after several months of delays, the \\"205N\\" was ready. The C.205N1 first flew on 1 November 1942, with armament consisting of a 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub, and four cowling-mounted 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda- SAFAT machine guns for which it carried 300‚Äì400 and 1,400 rounds of ammunition respectively. This configuration allowed a higher ceiling but lower speed []. The better aerodynamics (with a longer and more streamlined rear fuselage) provided an advantage over the Macchi C.205V/MG151 []. The maiden flight of the second prototype, the C.205N2, took place on 19 May 1943, reaching during testing, which was marginally slower than the C.205N1 with a correspondingly longer time to reach its operational altitude. It was equipped with one engine-mounted 20 mm cannon, two wing-mounted 20 mm cannon and two fuselage- mounted 12.7 mm (.5 in) machine guns. The ammunition load comprised 600 or more 12.7 mm (.5 in) rounds and a maximum of around 900 20 mm rounds which was much heavier than that carried by the C.205N1 and more than that of the Reggiane and the Fiat which carried 490‚Äì550 and 650 20 mm rounds respectively. Although 1,200 aircraft were ordered, the design was abandoned due to the Italian armistice. The N-series aircraft should have performed better than the C.205V but Macchi test pilot Guido Carestiato noted that their flying characteristics were inferior to the lighter and more agile C.205 Veltro. The later series also experienced overheating while climbing.Lembo 2002, p. 5. =Design= The C.205, known initially as the C.202bis, was generally similar to the previous Folgore, although there were numerous differences in the fuselage: the tail was larger, the cockpit and its hump were redesigned, the antenna mast was bigger and some modifications were made to the wings. The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, monoplane fighter, intended primarily as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The long nose housed the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, with the main fuel tank situated between the engine and the cockpit. The radiator was located under the centre section of the fuselage beneath the cockpit while the short rear section housed the radio equipment, oxygen cylinder and an 80 L (20 US gal) reserve fuel tank. The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional fuel tanks, and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the inner wing, all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. Veltros had self- sealing fuel tanks, an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a rear-view mirror. The 827 kg/1,823 lb (normal) payload consisted of the fully equipped pilot (85 kg/187 lb), fuel (307 kg/677 lb), two Breda machine guns and two Mauser MG 151/20 cannon (60 and 84 kg/130 and 185 lb respectively), 740 rounds of 12.7 mm (.5 in) ammunition (76 kg/168 lb), 500 rounds of 20 mm ammunition (100 kg/220 lb), and other sundry items such as oil (33 kg/73 lb), oxygen cylinder (12 kg/26 lb) and radio equipment. Additionally, 100 L (30 US gal) fuel tanks or 160 kg (350 lb) of bombs could be carried on two underwing hardpoints. Due to a lack of passenger transport aircraft, modifications were made to a C.205 to enable it to carry eight passengers in the belly of the fuselage and, among others, three pilots of 51¬∞ Wing (including Adriano Visconti) made the journey from Sardinia to Italy after the Armistice in this manner. Veltros originally had \\"tropical\\" pattern camouflage, with a sand brown base coat and irregular black-green lines all over their surface (referred to as \\"smoke rings\\"). Those in service with Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana were painted an overall dark green (nearly black), while others adopted a variation of the \\"tropical\\" pattern or carried a camouflage pattern based on the German \\"Splinter Pattern\\" consisiting of RLM 74 and 75, Gey/Green over RLM 76 Blue. =Relative performance= The following are relative performance and characteristics data for the three versions of the C.205 (or MC.205, as the machines designed by Castoldi were often called): :{ border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:3px double #999; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\" summary=\\"Comparative performance characteristics of the C.205V, N/1, and N/2. + style=\\"font-size:larger; text-align:left;\\"  - style=\\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\\" ! style=\\"width:140px;\\" ! style=\\"width:10px;\\" ! style=\\"text-align:left; width:115px;\\" C.205V ! style=\\"text-align:left; width:110px;\\" C.205N/1 ! style=\\"text-align:left; width:90px;\\" C.205N/2 - ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  Minimum weight (kg)   2,581  2,695  2,759 - ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  Maximum weight (kg)   3,408  3,621  3,794 - ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  Payload (kg)   827  926  935 - ! style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  Ceiling (m)   11,200  11,500  11,800 - ! style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  Range (km)   950  1,020  950 - ! style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  Maximum speed (km/h)   642/620 (at 7,500 m) [1]  629 (at 6,500 m)  628 (at 6,500 m) - ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  Time to 5,000 m altitude   4 min 47 sec  5 min 46 sec  6 min 14 sec - ! style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  Time to 6,000 m altitude   5 min 53 sec [2]  6 min 07 sec  7 min 38 sec - ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  Time to 7,000 m altitude   7 min 06 sec [2]  7 min 45 sec  9 min 07 sec - ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  Time to 8,000 m altitude   9 min 09 sec [2]  9 min 25 sec  10 min 47 sec } Notes: 1\\\\. Series I/III 2\\\\. Under ideal conditions Although these figures provide an indication of the relative performance of each variant, and showed that the Orione, especially the N2, suffered as a result of the weight increase (particularly in climbs), they are not truly representative as they were obtained under different test conditions. As opposed to the two N versions, the Veltro was tested under ideal conditions, i.e. at light weight (3,250 kg/7,170 lb) and with full emergency power (2,750 rpm). In a climb to 6,000 m (19,700 ft), a Veltro III series, fully equipped and using combat (not emergency) power at 2,600 rpm needed 7 minutes. Production At the end of evaluation tests, the C.205 began series production, with a first order of 250 aircraft. The first C.205 left the factory in September 1942. Speed of production was very slow (about 12 machines per month),Dimensione Cielo 1972, p. 7. because of shortage of engines and strategic materials, and only in June 1943 did Macchi manage to complete the first batch of 100 fighters. It took until September before production reached 177 examples, of which 146 were delivered to Regia Aeronautica units.Matricardi 2006, p. 72. Operational history An Italian Macchi C.205 Veltro aircraft found on Catania airfield, Sicily (Italy) The C.205 entered production only five months after its maiden flight and began reaching front line units in February 1943. At the end of April, the 1¬∞ Stormo, based in Pantelleria, is the first unit to enter action with the C.205, on Mediterranean, escorting maritime and aerial convoys to and from Tunisia. During their first sortie, 22 C.205 clashed with very good results against more numerous formations of Curtiss P-40s and Supermarine Spitfires.Dimensione Cielo 1972, p. 8. During the next few months, C.205s of the Regia Aeronautica were involved in several major engagements with some of the 4,000 Allied aircraft that were stationed in the Mediterranean at that time. At the end of May, because of the vulnerability of Pantelleria, the 1¬∞ Stormo was moved to Sigonella airfield in Sicily and the minor airstrip of Finocchiara, 15 km south-east of Ragusa. On 8 June 1943, 15 C.205s of 1¬∞ Stormo escorted three torpedo bombers attacking Allied ships which were shelling Pantelleria's defenses. At the end of June, the Stormo had no more serviceable Veltros. On 24 June, 1¬∞ Stormo left Sicily for Osoppo, then later Ronchi dei Legionari, and was replaced by 4¬∞ Stormo. Few pilots returned to Udine, while the remaining aircraft joined other units. 4¬∞ Stormo, which had left Africa in January 1943, was re-equipped with Macchi C.202s and C.205s on the airfields of Campoformido (10¬∞ Gruppo) and Bresso (9¬∞ Gruppo). It was then moved to Rome-Ciampino airport. On 9 July 1943 (the eve of the Allied invasion of Sicily), 4¬∞ Stormo was based on the Catania plain, with a complement of 10 Veltros and 38 Folgores (no Italian unit was equipped with Veltros alone). Later it received a batch of a further 10 C.205s. The Italian pilots flew as many as six sorties per day, but on 14 July, with the first Allied paratroopers landing on the Catania plain, 4¬∞ Stormo was forced to retreat to Crotone airfield in Calabria after setting fire to four or five damaged C.205s that could not be repaired in time. 51¬∞ Stormo fought with some success over Sardinia (apart from the battle of 2 August), but sustained heavy losses, especially at the end of July and the beginning of August. 3¬∞ Stormo C.T., commanded by Tenente Colonnello Tito Falconi, also had the opportunity to fly the Veltro in combat. At the time it was based at Cerveteri airstrip, with the task of defending Rome, 83¬™, 85¬™ and 95¬™ Squadriglia, 18¬∞ Gruppo (of 3¬∞ Stormo) all received a number of C.205s. Commander Falconi assigned them to the most eminent pilots: Sergente Maggiore Luigi Gorrini, Tenente Franco Bordoni-Bisleri and Maresciallo Guido Fibbia.Nino Arena, Macchi MC. 205, Modena, Stem Mucchi 1994 3¬∞ Stormo used the new type effectively to intercept American bombers and fighters in the skies over Latium. \\"The Macchi fighter possessed some excellent qualities, and the Italian pilots made optimum use of the aircraft which had a maximum speed of 644 km/h (400 mph).\\"Neulen 2000, p. 70. One of the greatest British fighter pilots of World War II, Group Captain Duncan-Smith DSO DFC respected both the Macchi and the Italian airmen: Like its predecessors, the first Veltros were insufficiently armed, but the aircraft often performed well in combat. Guido Carestiato said the C.205 was the \\"best Italian fighter that he knew\\". The C.205 ace Luigi Gorrini scored 19 or 24 victories (in return, he was downed four or five times). Gorrini claimed 12 victories in July 1943, several of them with the Veltro.Lembo 2002, p. 4. =Battle of Pantelleria= Regia Aeronautica C.205V with a North Africa dust filter. 1¬∞ Stormo received the first Veltros in time to fight over the southern Italian air base. In free-ranging patrols, the wing fielded 24 Veltros (around 1/10 of all those produced) and nine Folgores in an attempt to intercept enemy aircraft in the area. While patrolling between Cap Bon and Cap Mustaf√† on 20 April 1943, Italian fighters spotted a large enemy formation 35 km (22 mi) west of Pantelleria. The Italians started to close in to the aircraft of Nos. 1, 92, 417, and 601 SAAF Squadrons, which were flying at low level, but were surprised by six Polish pilots of 145 Squadron flying high cover. These were joined by other Spitfires, and the 33 Macchis found themselves in combat with up to 60 Spitfires (mainly Mk VCs, and possibly Mk VIIIs and IXs). The Italian pilots claimed 15 victories (one by Maresciallo Baschirotto, who fired 500 rounds), with 14 Spitfires downed in the sea and another over African soil. However, another analysis of this combat shows that the Regia Aeronautica pilots claimed a total of 17 aircraft on 20 April and claimed to have downed 15 Spitfires in this engagement; although Italian ground observers claimed to have seen 14 aircraft crash into the sea or onto land, only one Spitfire, flown by Flg Off Drecki of 145 Sqn, was heavily damaged. In return, three C.205Vs were lost. There is also a possibility that Bf 109s of I./JG77 were involved in this engagement.Shores et al. 1975, p. 330. Allied records report only two C.205Vs downed (Tenenti Andreoli and Fanelli), while another made an emergency landing near Cap Bon, and explains why some sources quote two losses and others three, but there is some doubt as to whether this aircraft, the only one to touch down on African soil, was a Veltro or a Folgore. At least one other Macchi was damaged, and the pilot wounded. Similarly, the Italian claims did not match any losses recorded in Allied squadron reports. =Battle of Capo Pula= On 2 August 1943, two British Beaufighters were downed and the Italians sent a CANT Z.506 Airone aircraft escorted by four C.205Vs on a search-and-rescue mission. A group of P-40s attacked the Z.506, but despite the defence put up by the Veltros, one American fighter crashed into the Z.506 and both fell into the sea.Mattioli 2002 A USAAF search and rescue PBY Catalina mission was also mounted, escorted by 12 P-38s. C.202 and C.205s of 51¬∞ Stormo, led by Ennio Tarantola, intercepted this flight. The Catalina was taken by surprise on the surface near the Sardinian coast, having broken a propeller blade in the heavy sea conditions. The Italians also claimed to have downed all 12 P-38s, whereas the Americans claimed three or four victories over the Axis fighters with no losses. Later records showed that only the Catalina and the C.202 of Maresciallo Bianchi, a close friend of Tarantola, had been shot down.Mattioli 2002 The two or three victories over P-38s claimed by Tarantola are not supported by any data available; however, no further SAR missions were made by Americans to search for the downed pilots. Except for a crewman killed by strafing, the crew of the Catalina was saved, thanks to a fast vessel of the Royal Navy whose captain was awarded the DSC for battling adverse sea conditions, coastal battery fire and enemy aircraft while rescuing the survivors.Mattioli 2002 =Defence of Rome= In mid 1943, Gorrini obtained one of the three C.205s delivered to the 3¬∞ Stormo (the other two were assigned to other aces, Tenente Franco Bordoni Bisleri and Maresciallo Guido Fibbia). In six weeks, during the Difesa di Roma, Gorrini became the top scoring C.205 pilot; by the Armistice, he had claimed three Consolidated B-24 Liberators, three Lockheed P-38 Lightnings (three damaged), two B-17s and two Spitfires.Pagliano 1969, pp. 195‚Äì202. Given the shortage of modern aircraft, more advanced combat aircraft like the Veltros were usually given to the best flyers and most experienced pilots like Vittorio Minguzzi. =After the Armistice= At the time of the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces on 8 September 1943, the Regia Aeronautica had received 177 Veltros, but only 66 were still usable. Six of these flew to Allied airfields to serve with the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force. =Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana= A total of 29 C.205s reached northern airfields and were used by the Italian Social Republic Air Force (ANR ‚Äì Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana). Macchi produced the remaining 72 aircraft of the third series for the ANR before production was shut down by Allied bombing in May 1944. Statistics on aircraft production post-Armistice are unclear and incomplete. In general, C.205s fought well in RSI service: they were attached to units that had homogeneous equipment, or at least of comparable quality, and were guided by German radar stations. Though few in number, they achieved success in inflicting losses on Allied bombers and fighters. The first air battle of the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana ‚Äì still with German insignia ‚Äì took place on 3 January 1944. The C.205s, guided by Italian ace Capitano Adriano Visconti, intercepted a formation of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and their escort of Lockheed P-38 Lightnings bombing RIV factories in Villar Perosa. On 24 January, the Macchi 205 were transferred to two bases in Friuli. On 28 January, the C.205s, now with Italian markings, succeeded in shooting down a B-24 Liberator, their first four-engined American bomber. This air victory was credited to Sergente Marconcini, wingman of the ace Visconti.Giuseppe Pesce. con Giovanni Massimello. Adriano Visconti Asso di guerra. Parma: Albertelli Edizioni, 1997. 1¬∞ Gruppo, based in Udine, was equipped with a few Veltros. According to one author: A few Veltros were also delivered to 3¬∞ Gruppo, based in Vicenza, while further Veltros were scattered throughout other small units. Regia Aeronautica also had a poor opinion about the Macchi C.205N, plagued by overheating in the climb. The 1¬∞ Gruppo C.T. of the ANR, based at the Campoformido airfield, was equipped with C.205. Its first operation, on 3 January, began with a surprise blow right away: the Italian fighter pilots shot down four P-38 Lightnings. By 25 February, 1¬∞ Gruppo C.T. had reported 26 victories for nine losses. An extremely bitter aerial combat took place on 11 March. The Italians claimed 12 victories for themselves, but lost three of their own pilots, including 1st Lt Boscutti, who was killed by an American P-38 Lightning pilot after he had bailed out from his stricken fighter and was hanging from his parachute. On 18 March, 30 C.205s from 1¬∞ Gruppo C.T. and 60 Bf 109 from JG.77 joined combat with about 450 Allied bombers and their escorts, shooting down at least four enemy aircraft, but Corp. Zaccaria was killed while hanging from his parachute again by a P-38 pilot who fired at him from close range.Neulen 2000, p. 79. Allied bombing in April 1944 destroyed most of the Macchi and Fiat facilities bringing fighter production to an end. With the interruption of production, the Italians were forced to re-equip their three groups almost fully with Bf 109s, largely because the Germans were quick to offer some of their best models, including Bf 109G-6s and Bf 109K-4s. The Allies were less generous with the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force (ICAF), and Veltros, including some upgraded C.202s, were slowly replaced with worn-out P-39s and Spitfires, but not before summer 1944.Gueli, Marco. \\"Spitfire con Coccarde Italiane.\\" Storia Militare magazine, n.62. Parma: Albertelli editions, pp. 4‚Äì10. = In Luftwaffe service = Luftwaffe II.Gruppe of JG 77 operated with requisitioned C.205Vs for two months, from October until December 1943 Neulen 2000, p. 78., when the German unit was re- equipped with new Bf 109s. Thus there are photos of C.205s with black crosses painted over the mid-fuselage Italian white stripe markings. The Germans were less enthusiastic about the C.205Vs, nor were they really impressed by the early evaluations in spring of 1943. There is mention in the KTB (History diary) on 25 November 1943 page: \\"the group has 23 Macchi, 11 are ready to fight. Macchi is fast and had a good flying characteristics, except for the tendency to lose control in sharp turns. The fighter is disadvantaged because its radio, while powerful, is far from reliable in action. Refueling and rearming process is slow and difficult, it takes much time to make the fighters ready. Today's mission was made with 17 Macchis, radio control problems caused delays, and the mission concluded without intercepting the enemy.\\"D'Amico, Fernando and Valentini Gabriele. \\"I Veltro dell'Asso di Cuori.\\" (in Italian) JP-4 magazine, May 1991, pp. 78‚Äì83. In the brief German use, Veltros had at least five losses by accidents, often caused by the inverted throttle used on Italian aircraft (In German and Allied fighters the \\"open throttle\\" position was forward, not back, and this was the source of several errors). The first losses occurred on 27 September 1943 near Albenga. Two German pilots were killed and other wounded in these accidents. On the other side, it was recorded only one aerial combat in which Germans claimed at least one P-38 and two probable (1 December 1943). After II.JG 77 was equipped with new Bf 109s, the C.205s were sent to Italian units. Some Veltros were ferried by JG 53. = In Croatian Service = A small batch of C.205s were in service with the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr≈æave Hrvatske (ZNDH) in 1944, but the Croatian \\"Veltros\\" flew few sorties and were soon overwhelmed by the waves of Allied fighters that swarmed over Yugoslavian skies. On 30 June 1944, three recently arrived Macchi C.205s, flown by Eastern Front veterans (Major Josip Helebrant, Oberleutenant Ljudevit \\"Lujo\\" BenceticSavic and Ciglic 2002, p. 77‚Äì78. and Feldwebel Bozidar \\"Bosko\\" BartulovicSavic and Ciglic 2002, p. 85.), along with three inexperienced pilots in Macchi C.202s, took off to intercept USAAF Fifteenth Air force bombers heading to bomb Blechhammer, location of Nazi Germany chemical plants, prisoner of war (POW) camps, and forced labor camps. The Macchis attacked the USAAF bombers and their escorting fighters, 5th FS/52nd FG P-51 Mustangs over Bjelovar, but five of the Italian-built aircraft were shot down both by the bomber's defensive fire and by the Mustangs. Only Bencetic ‚Äì an ace with a final score of 15 kills and his \\"Veltro\\" succeeded in returning to base at Zagreb.Savic and Ciglic 2002, p. 66. Helebrant and Bartulovic bailed out and survived the war, with a final score of, respectively, 11 and eight kills.Savic and Ciglic 2002, pp. 82‚Äì85. =Postwar= Macchi C.205 Veltro in service with the postwar Aeronautica Militare, around 1960. During 1948‚Äì1949, Egypt received 62 refurbished C.205Vs,Cattanno 1995, pp. 76‚Äì77. of which 41 were converted from C.202 airframes. In May 1948, eight C.205V and 16 C.202 were upgraded and in February 1949, three brand new and 15 ex-MC.202, and in May another 10 MC.205 and 10 MC.202 were upgraded. This last contract was not finalized and, given the end of the Israeli War of Independence (1948‚Äì49), the fighters were delivered to Aeronautica Militare Italiana (AMI). Egypt also ordered 19 G.55s and Syria another 16, all new-built. The new Veltros were fully equipped, while the Folgore conversions were armed with only two 12.7 mm Breda machine guns. They were the lightest series of the entire production, and consequently had the best performance, but were seriously under-armed. A total of 15 Macchis were delivered to Egypt before the end of the 1948 Arab- Israeli War, seeing brief combat against the Israeli Air Force.Cattano 1995, p. 77. Some Veltros, equipped with underwing bomb racks were used in ground- attack sorties against Israeli targets.Berrone 2000, p. 116. On 7 January 1949, a C.205 claimed an Israeli P-51D Mustang.Glancey 2006, p. 168. In return two or three Veltros had been claimed by IAF fighters by the end of the war in July, with another six under repair.Berrone 2000, p. 117. Israeli secret services reacted with a bombing in Italy, which at the time was supplying both Israel and the Arab states. On 15 February 1947, an SM.95 airliner was destroyed, possibly by sabotage, soon after takeoff from Rome. On board were an Egyptian princess, several politicians and an Italian intelligence officer. A subsequent bombing was at Venegono on 18 September 1948; one hangar was damaged by several explosive devices, destroying three MB.308 and one MC.205 in Macchi facilities. The hangar, not totally demolished, contained several Veltros destined for Egypt. All the G.55s ordered by Egypt were armed with four Breda(12.7 mm) machine-guns, and they were brand new; 16 were single- seaters and three were twin-seaters. Syria ordered sixteen G.55A (all single- seaters). The MM/Snc were: Macchi first batch: 1201‚Äì1224; second batch, 1225‚Äì1242. Fiat G.55A were 91214-91220, 91225-91229, 91221-91224 (G.55B two- seats).Gori, Paolo. \\"Caccia Italiani in Palestina (in Italian)\\". JP-4 magazine, April 1991, pp. 64‚Äì68. The last Veltros were delivered in 1951, the fighter serving mainly with No.2 Sqn until the mid-1950s. The last batch, 20 Veltros (10 ex-MC.202, six Veltro sr.III and 4 sr.I) were assigned to AMI with deliveries continuing until 29 May 1951. The phasing out process was however swift, because the new Anglo-American jet fighters were available at a surprisingly low cost at the time of the official phasing out of the Veltro (around 1951), although the last MC.205 was phased out in 1955. The \\"Folgore\\" was stricken off register in 1948, with the exception of those C.202 airframes transformed into Veltros.  An Allied test pilot opinion  Capt. Eric Brown, CBE, DSC, AFC, RN, Chief Naval Test Pilot and C.O. Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight, remembered how they were impressed when they tested the Veltro. \\"One of the finest aircraft I ever flew was the Macchi MC. 205. Oh, beautiful. And here you had the perfect combination of Italian styling and German engineering. I believe it was powered by a Daimler Benz DB 605. It was really a delight to fly, and up to anything on the Allied programme. But again, it came just before the Italians capitulated so it was never used extensively. And we did tests on it and were most impressed. The cockpit was smallish but not as bad as the Bf 109.\\"Thompson with Smith 2008, p. 231. Variants With limited production and service life, the C.205 saw only a few modifications. After the first 100 examples, the wing-mounted 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns were replaced with a couple of 20 mm MG 151 cannon. ;M.C.205 :One prototype armed with two 12.7 mm (0.5 in) and two 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine guns. ;M.C.205V :Main production version. ;M.C.205S :Long-range escort fighter with a 200 L (53 US gal) fuel tank replacing the fuselage machine guns; 18 converted from production aircraft. ;M.C.205N :Proposed DB 605-powered fighter with a more significant design revision than the C.202-derived C.205V. The aircraft had a new wing with the wingspan increased to 11.25 m (36 ft 11 in) and wing area increased to 19 m2 (204.5 ft2), and a lengthened fuselage that brought the length to 9.65 m. Also, the fuselage was finally adapted for a 20 mm MG 151 cannon. The heavier weight resulted in decreased performance and handling. ;M.C.205N-1 :High-altitude interceptor fighter prototype. Armed with four 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine guns mounted in the fuselage, and one 20 mm cannon mounted in the engine. ;M.C.205N-2 Orione :High-altitude interceptor fighter prototype. Armed with three 20 mm cannon and two 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine guns. The machine gun bulges were replaced by a streamlined fairing. ;M.C.206 :Similar armament to the C.205N/1 with a larger yet lighter wing (21 m2). Reduced weight resulting in performances similar to that of the C.205V again. The larger wing would have enabled it to fight at higher altitudes. Single prototype destroyed by Allied bombing before being completed. ;M.C.207 :Powered by a Daimler-Benz DB 603 engine. Other than that, similar to C.206 but with armament of four 20 mm cannon, none built.

The Lion of Babylon has remained a prominent symbol of Iraqi culture, a type of Iraqi battle tank was named after it. The 4,100-year-old Great Ziggurat of Ur in western Iraq. Iraq has one of the world's oldest cultural histories. Iraq is where the Ancient Mesopotamian civilizations were, whose legacy went on to influence and shape the civilizations of the Old World. Culturally, Iraq has a very long and rich heritage. The country is known for its poets and its painters and sculptors are among the best in the Arab world, some of them being world-class. Iraq is known for producing fine handicrafts, including rugs and carpets. The architecture of Iraq is seen in the sprawling metropolis of Baghdad, where the construction is mostly new, with some islands of exquisite old buildings and compounds, and elsewhere in thousands of ancient and modern sites across Iraq. Like several fellow Arab nations in the Levant and different from most Gulf Arab nations, Iraq embraces and celebrates the achievements of its past in pre-Islamic times. What is now Iraq was once the Cradle of Civilization in Ancient Mesopotamia and the culture of Sumer, where writing and the wheel were invented. In the 8th and 9th centuries, the Islamic Abbasid Caliph's presided over what was then one of the world's richest civilizations. Minaret at the Great Mosque of Samarra, c. 850. Architecture Cinema While Iraq's first film projection took place in 1909, cinema was not truly regarded as a cultural activity or pastime until the 1920s. The first cinemas, like the famous al-Zawra cinema on Baghdad's bustling thoroughfare al-Rashid, played mostly American silent films for British citizens. In the 1940s under the rule of King Faisal II of Iraq, a real Iraqi cinema began. Supported by British and French financiers, movie production companies established themselves in Baghdad. The Baghdad Studio was established in 1948, but soon came apart when tensions between the Arab and Jewish founders flared up. For the most part, the product was purely commercial, fluffy romances with plenty of singing and dancing often set in small villages. The World of Arts (Dunyat Alfann) studio, which was founded by actors, reached for more serious fare. In 1955, they produced Haidar Al-Omar's Fitna wa Hassan, an Iraqi retelling of Romeo and Juliet, that received international attention. But for the most part, the strong-fist rule of the state discouraged any socially relevant films. In 1959 when King Faisel II's government was overthrown, the Cinema and Theater General organization came into existence with the purpose of promoting the political goals of the new regime both in documentaries and features. Typical were documentaries like the 1969 Al Maghishi Project, which showcased the government's irrigation campaigns and the 1967 A Wedding in Heaven, which celebrates the air force and their weapons system. The 1968 revolution that put the Ba'ath party in power further solidified the government's control of film material, and the state's need to make all films validate its power. Saddam Hussein's ascension to power in 1979 pushed the Iraqi cinema in a slightly different direction. The drain on national resources from the 1980 Iraq-Iran war brought film production to a near halt. The few films put into production were mainly intent on glorifying a mythic Iraqi history or celebrating Hussein's rule. In 1981, the government commissioned Egyptian filmmaker Salah Abouseif to make Al-Qadisiya, a period epic recounting the triumph of the Arabs over the Persians in 636 AD. Likewise Mohamed Shukri Jameel's melodramatic The Great Question (al-Mas' Ala Al-Kubra) cast British actor Oliver Reed as the vicious Lt-Col Gerard Leachman who is righteously killed in the 1920 Iraqi revolution. In 1980 Hussein promoted his own mythology with the autobiographical 6-hour epic The Long Days (al-Ayyam al- tawila), the saga of Hussein's participation in the 1958 failed assassination attempt on Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, and his subsequent heroic escape back to Tikrit. The film was edited and partially directed by Terence Young, the British director who made his name helming the early James Bond films Dr. No and Thunderball (film). Hussein is played by Saddam Kamel, a cousin and son-in-law of Hussein's, who eventually ran afoul of the dictator and was murdered in 1996. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, sanctions against Iraq made filmmaking an impossibility in the country, although a new generation of filmmakers is coming alive in Baghdad Literature Iraqi literature is, and has been, deeply marked by Iraq's political history. In the late 1970s, a period of economic upturn, prominent writers in Iraq were provided with an apartment and car by Saddam Hussein's government, and were guaranteed at least one publication per year. In exchange, literature was expected to express and galvanise support for the ruling Ba'ath Party. The Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980-1988) fuelled a demand for patriotic literature, but also pushed a number of writers into opting for exile. According to Najem Wali, during this period, \\"[e]ven those who chose to quit writing saw themselves forced to write something that did not rile the dictator, because even silence was considered a crime.\\" From the late 1980s onwards, Iraqi exile literature developed with writers whose \\"rejection of dominant ideology and [whose] resistance to the wars in Iraq compelled them to formulate a 'brutally raw realism' characterized by a shocking sense of modernity\\" (N. Wali). Late 20th century Iraqi literature has been marked by writers such as Saadi Youssef, Fadhil Al-Azzawi, Mushin Al- Ramli, Salah Al-Hamdani, Abdul Rahman Majeed al-Rubaie and Sherko Fatah. Music Sport Celebrations in Iraq after Iraqi national team wins the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Football is the most well known sport in Iraq. The Iraq national football team were the 2007 AFC Asian Cup Champions after defeating Saudi Arabia in the final, held in Jakarta, Indonesia. In 2006, Iraq reached the football final of the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, after defeating former FIFA World Cup semi-finalists South Korea and eventually finished as runners-up, winning silver. The football tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, saw Iraq finish in fourth place, with the Italy national football team claiming bronze from a single goal. The Iraqi Football Association is the governing body of football in Iraq, controlling the Iraq national football team and the Iraq Super League (also known as Dawri Al- Nokba). It was founded in 1948, and has been a member of FIFA since 1950, and the Asian Football Confederation since 1971. Al-Shorta (Police Club) are considered the biggest club in the history of Iraq, having won the league in 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14 and they also have an Arab Champions League title to their name which they won in 1982. Other big clubs include Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, Al- Zawraa, Erbil SC, Duhok SC, Al Talaba and Najaf FC. Basketball, swimming, weightlifting, bodybuilding, boxing, kickboxing, and tennis are also popular sports.

Cuisine Iraqi cuisine or Mesopotamian cuisine has a long history going back some 10,000 years ‚Äì to the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Ancient Persians.http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/3592 Foods of Iraq: Enshrined With A Long History. Habeeb Salloum. Tablets found in ancient ruins in Iraq show recipes prepared in the temples during religious festivals - the first cookbooks in the world. Ancient Iraq, or Mesopotamia, was home to a sophisticated and highly advanced civilization, in all fields of knowledge - including the culinary arts. However, it was in the Islamic Golden Age when Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate that the Iraqi kitchen reached its zenith. Today, the cuisine of Iraq reflects this rich inheritance, as well as strong influences from the culinary traditions of neighbouring Persia, Turkey, and the Syria region. . Some popular dishes include Kebab (often marinated with garlic, lemon, and spices, then grilled), Gauss (grilled meat sandwich wrap, similar to D√∂ner kebab), Bamieh (lamb, okra, and tomato stew), Quzi (lamb with rice, almonds, raisins, and spices), and salad in pita, Kubbah (minced meat ground with bulghur wheat, or rice and spices), Masg√ªf (grilled fish with pepper and tamarind), and Maqluba (a rice, lamb, tomato, and aubergine dish). Stuffed vegetable dishes such as Dolma and Mahshi are also popular. Machbous is also a popular dish in the south and south east of Iraq. Contemporary Iraq reflects the same natural division as ancient Mesopotamia, which consisted of Assyria in the arid northern uplands and Babylonia in the southern alluvial plain. Al-Jazira (the ancient Assyria) grows wheat and crops requiring winter chill such as apples and stone fruits. Al-IrƒÅq (Iraq proper, the ancient Babylonia) grows rice and barley, citrus fruits, and is responsible for Iraq's position as the world's largest producer of dates. Modern culture =Cultural heritage= Iraq is a country of a wide and varied heritage, home to Muslims. As such many have contributed to the wide spectrum of Iraqi Culture. Traditional music consists of instruments such as ouds, flutes, violins, drums, and tambourines. Now however, there are many young artists generating pop, rap, and wider types of musical genres. Kulthum and Fairouz are two woman singers renowned for their voices and especially loved in Iraq. Tea houses are scattered throughout Iraq, and in the afternoon, it is a habit for shopkeepers to retreat into the back with close friends to sip tea over gossip, an Iraqi \\"siesta\\". Arab rites of passage in Iraq are primarily centered on children being educated to correctly read the Quran. The Quran is a difficult text to read properly for various reasons, among them: the depth of meaning and various uses of a large number of distinct and indistinct words, the various schools of thought concerning tajwid or what exactly makes a \\"proper\\" recitation, and the complex sounds Arabic demands from human vocal cordss. A child (or any person) who has completely memorized the Quran is called a \\"hafiz\\", or \\"guardian\\". There is usually a large celebration in the child's honor if he has reached this level of excellence. =Cultural institutions= Iraqi National Museum after restoration. Some important cultural institutions in the capital include the Iraqi National Orchestra (rehearsals and performances were briefly interrupted during the Occupation of Iraq, but have since returned to normal) and the National Theatre of Iraq (the theatre was looted during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, but efforts are underway to restore the theatre). The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s, when UN sanctions limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of comedies and dramatic productions. Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include the Academy of Music, Institute of Fine Arts, and the Music and Ballet school Baghdad. Baghdad also features a number of museums including the National Museum of Iraq - which houses the world's largest and finest collection of artifacts and relics of Ancient Iraq civilizations; some of which were stolen during the Iraq War.

Background  John Lange was born in Chicago, Illinois, to John Frederick Lange and Almyra D. Lange (n√©e Taylor). He began his academic career in the early 1950s, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Nebraska in 1953, and his Master of Arts degree from the University of Southern California in 1957. While at USC he married Bernice L. Green on January 14, 1956. The couple have three children: John, David, and Jennifer.  Academic career  Lange earned his PhD in 1963 from Princeton University. His dissertation was named: \\"In defence of ethical naturalism: an examination of certain aspects of naturalistic fallacy, with particular attention to the logic of an open question argument\\". Lange summed it up in an interview by saying \\"if one cannot make sense of morality within some sort of satisfying, natural context, then one is likely to end up with no morality, which is less than societally reassuring, or is likely to end up with a competitive plethora of moralities in which ninety-nine percent of the world's population is convinced that the other ninety-nine percent is unclean, stupid, uninformed, vicious, depraved, in need of coercive correction, and such. That too, seems less than reassuring.\\" He was a professor at Queens College of the City University of New YorkPhilosophy Page Full Time Faculty before retirement.  Writing career  Norman's fiction attained popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s with an estimated 6 to 12 million copies sold. John Norman's Gorean Saga is a long-running series of adventure science fantasy novels, starting in December 1966 with Tarnsman of Gor. The series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment, Magicians of Gor, in 1988, when DAW refused to publish its successor, Witness of Gor. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet, the series was brought back into print in 2001 with the publication of Witness of Gor. Norman has also produced a separate science fiction series, the Telnarian Histories, plus three other fiction works, five non-fiction works, and a collection of thirty short stories. Norman has said that the three major influences on his work are Homer, Freud, and Nietzsche.http://io9.com/5783833/john-norman-the-philosopher-who-created- the-barbaric-world-of-gor  Themes  According to Norman, his Gor books are science fiction or adventure fantasy works which are also \\"intellectual, philosophical, and psychological novels\\".John Norman, the philosophy professor who created the barbaric world of Gor iO9. March 22, 2011. His fiction depicts fantastic worlds where male-dominated bondage relationships are natural and widely practiced and respected culturally, whereas characteristics of modern society are criticized and philosophical themes are explored, specially from a Nietzschean view. Although the bondage in his Imaginative Sex guide is directed to sexual practices, the bondage and slavery presented on \\"Gor\\" follows along the lines of societal or legal slavery; a common way of life as reflected in ancient Rome and other societies. While the philosophy presented is unquestionably that of male dominance, male characters are themselves often enslaved by powerful females. In an interview with Polygraff magazine, Norman stated that he believes that it is obvious that all societies are based on dominance and hierarchy. His non-fiction works cover philosophy, ethics and historiography. = Gorean subculture = A fandom based on his Gor novels, known as the Gorean subculture, has developedBBC: Officers discover sex-slave cult without Lange's direct involvement.

It was aimed at the enthusiast driver and promoted as more \\"European\\" than the automaker's similar models. The \\"Eagle\\" name was taken by Chrysler from the four-wheel drive AMC Eagle models that were introduced for the 1980 model year. This was the last of American Motors' wholly U.S.-designed vehicles and arguably the first modern mass-production crossover automobile. The Eagle name also appeared on a number of Jeep trim packages and special models that included the J-10 pickup trucks, the wide-track Cherokee SJ, as well as the CJ-5 and CJ-7 models starting in 1976. A variety of imported and domestic-built vehicles were marketed mostly by former AMC dealers along with Jeep products until the brand was discontinued in 1998. Though short-lived, the Eagle Vision sedan sold in respectable numbers, while the sporty Eagle Talon sold more than 115,000 units. Origin Following the introduction of General Motors' Saturn brand automobile, Chrysler promised a similar new brand designed to take Saturn on with innovative design and building methods. In a press release by then Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, it was indicated that Chrysler was working on a car that would bow as the \\"Liberty\\". However, these plans never reached fruition. The name later was used for a Jeep model. The main objective of Chrysler acquiring American Motors was the long established Jeep vehicles, but Renault forced the company to take on the contractual obligations of the passenger car models as part of the deal. Thus, \\"Eagle is a line of cars Chrysler inherited from AMC\\" and the Eagle marque was born. Under new ownership, Chrysler quickly discontinued the domestic-built front-wheel drive Alliance and Encore that were developed under Renault, but continued to build the four-wheel drive AMC Eagle crossover. It was now called Eagle Wagon and marketed into the 1988 model year until production ended in December. This meant the Brampton Assembly (AMC) manufacturing capacity could be used for making more Jeeps. Moreover, Chrysler kept AMC's long established Eagle brand by continuing to import the mid-sized Renault 21 (now named Eagle Medallion) as well as starting production of the Renault 25-based full-size sedan that was developed by AMC (now named Eagle Premier). Marketing To consolidate the marketing and maintain distribution through AMC dealerships following the 1987 acquisition, the Jeep/Eagle division of Chrysler Corporation was formed. Chrysler's initial problem was that unlike the Big Three, which had multiple brands under their Corporate name, American Motors had sold passenger cars under its corporate initials of \\"AMC\\" since 1970. Thus, without having a separate brand from the now defunct company, Chrysler looked to re-brand the legacy vehicles inherited through the purchase of AMC under the Eagle name instead of trying to fold those outside- designed products into Chrysler's existing branch structure. Unlike Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth branded automobiles, the Eagle models lacked the Chrysler Corporation \\"pentastar\\" logo. Instead, all models prominently featured the Eagle head logo, seen at the top right. Two of Eagle's first models, the Eagle Premier and the Eagle Medallion, were designed by AMC in cooperation with its former corporate partner (and 46.4 percent owner), Renault. The remainder of the brand's cars were simply rebadged versions of cars sold by other Chrysler Corporation divisions, as well as some captive imports produced by Mitsubishi Motors. Throughout its history, the Eagle brand suffered from a lack of product recognition although its Premier was technically more advanced than anything offered by Chrysler. Most of Eagle's models were offered in Chrysler- Plymouth, Dodge, and Mitsubishi dealerships under different guises. Chrysler was in the midst of financial difficulty at the end of the 1980s, and did not have the funds to spread to its new automotive division. Moreover, Jeep vehicles were quite popular and profitable, so most of the division's marketing resources flowed to the Jeep product range. Since Jeep's products had better recognition and higher profit margins, many dealers placed greater emphasis on Jeeps, and considered the Eagle line of passenger cars to be a distraction to that business. Their sales and service expertise was primarily in the four-wheel drive Jeeps and AMC's Eagle all-wheel-drive models. Furthermore, following Chrysler's acquisition of AMC, there was a realignment of the dealership network. Some former AMC/Jeep dealers were consolidated with Chrysler-Plymouth franchises. Up to this point, Chrysler-Plymouth outlets did not have a sport utility vehicle (SUV) to sell, and adding the Jeep line helped dealers offer customers a range of vehicles in a rapidly growing market segment. The merger may have helped the individual dealerships that signed on, but it caused the nascent Eagle division and its largely derivative models to compete unfavorably for attention with Chrysler's and Plymouth's often similar, but longer-established and better-recognized, lines of passenger cars. Phase out The Eagle brand was phased out in stages. In 1996, Chrysler discontinued the Mitsubishi Mirage-based Eagle Summit, having canceled the nearly identical Dodge Colt and Plymouth Colt models after the 1994 season. After a decade of slow sales, Chrysler announced the discontinuation of the Eagle brand in September 1997, and the last 1998 Eagle Talon rolled off the line shortly thereafter. In 1997, the Eagle Vision was discontinued at the end of its design cycle, though the similar Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler Concorde were redesigned for 1998 and continued through 2004. Only the Mitsubishi Eclipse-based Eagle Talon remained for 1998, after which it, along with the Eagle brand itself, was discontinued. Chrysler had originally planned to redesign the Eagle Vision for 1999. Prototypes, called the VanCuren Eagle were even spotted wearing the Eagle logo, and Vision production continued into September 1997 to provide dealers with enough stock of the older car to carry them through to the new car's introduction. However, Chrysler executives decided to pull the plug on the Eagle brand just a few months later. The car they were working on went on to be marketed as the Chrysler 300M. The AMC name disappeared with Chrysler's acquisition of the independent automaker, \\"but the Eagle name carried on, worn by various Renault- and Mitsubishi-sourced models through the ‚Äò90s, when it was finally retired in 1998.\\" Those Eagle cars failed because the automaker did not have a coherent marketing strategy for the mix of models and they also lacked effective promotional efforts in the automotive marketplace. In the end, \\"Chrysler wasn't fully committed to the nameplate and also left consumers confused about what an Eagle was -- if they knew the name at all.\\" Eagle cars marketed by Chrysler Eagle Premier Eagle Summit wagon 1995 Eagle Talon * Eagle Wagon (1988) The continuation of the AMC Eagle line after Chrysler acquired AMC in only the station wagon body style. Production of the crossover vehicle ended December 14, 1987. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association NADA Guide, Chrysler's \\"Eagle was spawned from the buyout of American Motors and their AMC Eagle model.\\" * Eagle Medallion (1988‚Äì1989) Also badged as the Renault Medallion in 1987, this car was imported and was very similar to the Renault 21. * Eagle Premier (1988‚Äì1992) Designed by AMC, the Premier was briefly badged as the Renault Premier prior to launch. Unusual (for a FWD car) in having a north-south engine mounting (to accommodate a future AWD version), it shared several parts with the Renault 25, and spawned a rebadged version named Dodge Monaco (1990‚Äì1992); this platform was the basis for the 1993 LH cars. * Eagle Vista (1988‚Äì1992) Two models were offered. The 3-door hatchback and 4-door sedan were rebadged Mitsubishi Mirages, and the station wagon (badged as either an Eagle Vista, or a Dodge/Plymouth Colt Vista) was a rebadged Mitsubishi Chariot. Sold only in Canada. * Eagle Summit (1989‚Äì1996) Coupe, sedan, and wagon models were available. The coupe and 1987-1991 sedans were rebadged Mitsubishi Mirages, while the wagon was a rebadged Mitsubishi Expo LRV. The 1991-1996 sedan was a rebadged Dodge/Plymouth Colt. * Eagle Talon (1990‚Äì1998) Similar to the Plymouth Laser and the Mitsubishi Eclipse, the Talon was Eagle's halo car and outsold its Plymouth cousin.

Sold in Europe as the Chrysler Vision. Concept car The Eagle Optima was a 1990 concept car. It was a four-door sedan that used cab forward design and was powered by an experimental, 32-valve all-aluminum V8 engine with all-wheel drive. It was one of a series of concepts (which included the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino and the 1989 Chrysler Millennium) that lead up to the 1993 LH Eagle Vision and its siblings. The Optima's front fascia also inspired that of the 1995-1998 Eagle Talon. Other uses The name Eagle was also used by Dan Gurney's All American Racers team for his racing cars. Among the most notable are the Eagle Mk1 Formula One car, which won the 1967 Belgian Grand Prix; the winning cars at the 1968, 1973, and 1975 Indianapolis 500s; and the Toyota-Eagle IMSA GTPs of the late 1980s/early 1990s. The name was also applied to commercial trucks made by International Harvester, and subsequently by Navistar International as part of its International truck product line.

The first Proton rocket was launched in 1965. Modern versions of the launch system are still in use as of 2020, making it one of the most successful heavy boosters in the history of spaceflight. All Protons are built at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center factory in Moscow and Chemical Automatics Design Bureau http://www.kbkha.ru/?p=8&cat;=8‚àè=33 in Voronezh, transported to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, brought to the launch pad horizontally, and raised into vertical position for launch. As with many Soviet rockets, the names of recurring payloads became associated with the Proton. The moniker \\"Proton\\" originates from a series of similarly named scientific satellites, which were among the rocket's first payloads. During the Cold War, it was designated the D-1/D-1e or SL-12/SL-13 by Western intelligence agencies. Launch capacity to low Earth orbit is about .http://www.khrunichev.ru/main.php?id=54 Geostationary transfer capacity is about . Commercial launches are marketed by International Launch Services (ILS). In 2013, the rocket was intended to be retired before 2030. , production on the Proton rocket is ceasing as the new Angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational. No new launch service contracts for Proton are likely to be signed. History Proton started its life as a \\"super heavy ICBM\\". It was designed to launch a 100-megaton (or larger) thermonuclear weapon over a distance of 13,000 km. It was hugely oversized for an ICBM and was never deployed in such a capacity. It was eventually used as a space launch vehicle. It was the brainchild of Vladimir Chelomei's design bureau as a foil to Sergei Korolev's N1 rocket, whose purpose was to send a two-man Zond spacecraft around the Moon; Korolev openly opposed Proton and Chelomei's other designs for their use of toxic propellants. The unusual appearance of the first stage results from the need to transport components by rail. The central oxidizer tank is the maximum width for the loading gauge of the track. The six tanks surrounding it carry fuel and serve as the attachment points for the engines. Despite resembling strap-on boosters, they are not designed to separate from the central oxidizer tank. The first and second stages are connected by a lattice structure. The second stage engine ignites shortly before separation of the first stage and the lattice allows the exhaust to escape.The first stage of the Proton rocket at Russian Space Web A rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972. Proton did not complete its State Trials until 1977, at which point it was judged to have a higher than 90% reliability. Proton's design was kept secret until 1986, with the public being only shown the upper stages in film clips and photographs, and the first time the complete vehicle was shown to the outside world happened during the televised launch of Mir. Mass-production of guidance, navigation and control system for Proton has begun in 1964 on \\"Communard\\" Industrial Association (Kharkov, Ukraine). Proton launched the uncrewed Soviet circumlunar flights and was intended to have launched the first crewed Soviet circumlunar spaceflights, before the United States flew the Apollo 8 mission. Proton launched the Salyut space stations, the Mir core segment and expansion modules, and both the Zarya and Zvezda modules of the ISS. Proton also launches commercial satellites, most of them being managed by International Launch Services. The first ILS Proton launch was on 9 April 1996 with the launch of the SES Astra 1F communications satellite. Between 1994 and mid-2010, Proton revenues were $4.3 billion, and were projected to grow to $6 billion by 2011.Statement by Vladimir Ye. Nesterov, Khrunichev Director- General, at Press Conference on 15 July 2010 Khruhichev 29 July 2010. In January 2017, the Proton was temporarily grounded due to the manufacturer, Voronezh Mechanical Plant, having substituted a heat-resistant alloy in the engines with a cheaper metal. In June 2018, the state corporation Roscosmos announced that the Proton rocket would cease production as the new Angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational. No new launch service contracts for Proton are likely to be signed. Proton flew its last scheduled commercial mission on 9 October 2019, delivering Eutelsat 5 West B and Mission Extension Vehicle-1 to geostationary orbit.http://russianspaceweb.com/eutelsat5wb-mev1.html A number of Roscosmos and other Russian government missions remain on Proton launch manifest. Proton 8K82K The (GRAU index) 8K82K version is now usually called \\"Proton K\\". It is fuelled by very toxic unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. These are hypergolic fuels which ignite on contact, avoiding the need for an ignition system, and can be stored at ambient temperatures. This avoids the need for components that are tolerant of low temperatures, and allows the rocket to remain on the pad indefinitely (other launchers with such capability include the U.S. Titan II GLV, Titan III, and Titan IV, the Chinese Long March 2 and Long March 4, the Soviet/Ukrainian Tsyklon launchers, the Soviet/Russian Kosmos-3 and Kosmos-3M launchers and the European Ariane 1 to Ariane 4 launchers). In contrast, cryogenic fuels need periodic replenishment as they boil off. The fourth stage has multiple variants, depending on the mission. The simplest, Blok D, was used for interplanetary missions. Blok D had no guidance module, depending on the probe to control flight. Three different Blok DM versions (DM, DM2, and DM-2M) were for high Earth orbits. The Blok D/DM were unusual in that the fuel was stored in a toroidal tank, around the engine and behind the oxidizer tank. The initial Proton tests in 1965‚Äì66 only used the first two stages of the booster, the complete four-stage vehicle being flown for the first time in 1967. When the Soviet space station program began in 1971, Protons began being flown with the Blok D removed for use as a heavy-lift LEO launcher. Proton-K payloads included all of the Soviet Union's Salyut space stations, almost all Mir modules (with the exception of the Docking Module, which was launched on the United States Space Shuttle), and the Zarya and Zvezda modules of the International Space Station. It was intended to launch the crewed TKS spacecraft, prior to the cancellation of that programme, although a few robotic flights of spacecraft were fulfilled. In addition it was intended to launch the 1970s LKS spaceplane that was never realised. Proton-M The initial version of Proton M, could launch into geostationary orbit or into a geostationary transfer orbit. It could place up to in low Earth orbit with a 51.6-degree inclination, the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS). The Proton M's improvements included lower stage modifications to reduce structural mass, increase thrust, and fully use propellants. Generally a Briz-M ( meaning Breeze) storable propellant upper stage is used instead of the Blok D or Blok DM stage, removing the need for multiple fuel supplies and oxygen top-off due to boiling; the Proton-M also flew with a Blok-DM upper stage. Efforts were also made to reduce dependency on foreign (usually Ukrainian) component suppliers. With the Briz-M upper stage, the payload fairing diameter is 4.1 m (13.45 ft). Proton launch vehicles and Briz-M upper stages are designed and built by Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev) in Moscow, the majority owner of International Launch Services (ILS). The Center is home to all engineering, assembly and test functions of Proton production. With the recent consolidation of the Russian space enterprises, Khrunichev has direct oversight and control of up to 70% of all Proton manufacturing from suppliers to manufacturers. The consolidation directly supports Khrunichev's ongoing efforts for vertical integration of Proton production. An enhanced variant, the Phase III Proton-M/Briz-M launch vehicle, was flight proven on the Russian Federal dual mission of Express AM-44 and Express MD-1 in February 2009 and performed its first commercial launch in March 2010 with the Echostar XIV satellite. The Proton-M/Briz-M phase III configuration provides 6150 kg of GTO performance, an increase of 1150 kg over the original Proton-M Briz-M, while maintaining the fundamental design configuration. On 6 August 2012, the Russian Federal Space Agency lost a Russian and an Indonesian communications satellite in an attempt to launch them into orbit on a Proton-M due to technical difficulties with the last stage. On 2 July 2013, a Proton-M launching three GLONASS navigation satellites experienced a failure reminiscent of the 1960s disasters shortly after liftoff when the booster crashed near LC-39 at Baikonour, ending a 30-year unbroken stretch without a first stage failure; all future Proton flights were suspended pending investigation. The accident was eventually determined to be caused by the rate gyro package having been installed upside-down. Due to the difficulty of installing the package incorrectly, it was widely suspected that it had been done deliberately by a disgruntled or drunk worker at the Khrunichev plant. On 15 May 2014, a Proton-M/Briz-M carrying an Ekspress satellite suffered a third stage failure from a bad turbopump bearing. Debris fell in Manchuria. On 21 October, another Ekspress satellite was left in a useless orbit when the Briz stage cut off 24 seconds too early. On 16 May 2015, a MEXSAT communications satellite failed to orbit due to another third stage malfunction, the eighth Proton failure since 2010. Khrunichev has initiated development of a set of phase IV enhancements in order to keep pace with market demands and the mass growth trends of commercial satellites. The implementation of Phase IV Proton Briz-M enhancements were completed in 2016. The payload mass performance for phase IV has been increased to 6320 kg to a reference GTO orbit with 1500 m/s of residual delta V to GSO. Launches Future developments Significant upgrades were temporarily put on hold following announcement (in 1992) of the new Angara launch vehicle. The single largest upgrade was the KVRB stage. This cryogenic stage would have greatly increased capacity. The engine was developed successfully, and the stage as a whole had progressed to hardware. However, as KVRB is noticeably larger than Block D, the vehicle's aerodynamics, flight control, software, and possibly electronics would have to be reevaluated. In addition, the launch pad can supply existing Protons with common hypergolic fuels from single sources. The upper stages, in particular, are fed by common loading pipes running along the rocket. Switching to a stage with different fuels requires the addition of extra support articles; switching to cryogens requires that such support articles top off the stage periodically. Heavy variants of Angara will be simpler and cheaper than Proton (and like the Atlas V rocket, will not use hypergolic fuels; instead, it will use the same RP-1 fuel as that used on the Soyuz rocket). They will also be designed from the start to accept a KVTK stage, and will already have a LOX supply at the pad; only a hydrogen supply will be called upon.

It served as the standard-issue sidearm for the United States Armed Forces from 1911 to 1985. It was widely used in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The pistol's formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 for the original model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, which was adopted in 1924. The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam War era. The U.S. procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols in military contracts during its service life. The M1911 was replaced by the adoption of the 9 mm Beretta M9 pistol as the standard U.S. sidearm in 1985 and it officially entered service in 1990. But, due to its popularity among users, it has not been completely phased out. Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the U.S. Army Special Forces, U.S. Marine Corp and the U.S. Navy. Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols. It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as USPSA, IDPA, International Practical Shooting Confederation, and bullseye shooting. Compact variants are popular civilian concealed carry weapons in the U.S. because of the design's relatively slim width and the stopping power of the .45 ACP cartridge. History =Early history and adaptations= The M1911 pistol originated in the late 1890s as the result of a search for a suitable self-loading (or semi-automatic) pistol to replace the variety of revolvers then in service. The United States was adopting new firearms at a phenomenal rate; several new pistols and two all- new service rifles (the M1892/96/98 Krag and M1895 Navy Lee), as well as a series of revolvers by Colt and Smith & Wesson for the Army and Navy, were adopted just in that decade. The next decade would see a similar pace, including the adoption of several more revolvers and an intensive search for a self-loading pistol that would culminate in official adoption of the M1911 after the turn of the decade. Hiram S. Maxim had designed a self-loading rifle in the 1880s, but was preoccupied with machine guns. Nevertheless, the application of his principle of using cartridge energy to reload led to several self-loading pistols in 1896. The designs caught the attention of various militaries, each of which began programs to find a suitable one for their forces. In the U.S., such a program would lead to a formal test at the turn of the 20th century. M1911 designer John Browning During the end of 1899 and start of 1900, a test of self-loading pistols, including entries from Mauser (the C96 \\"Broomhandle\\"), Mannlicher (the Mannlicher M1894), and Colt (the Colt M1900), was conducted. This led to a purchase of 1,000 DWM Luger pistols, chambered in 7.65mm Luger, a bottlenecked cartridge. During field trials, these ran into some problems, especially with stopping power. Other governments had made similar complaints. Consequently, DWM produced an enlarged version of the round, the 9√ó19mm Parabellum (known in current military parlance as the 9√ó19mm NATO), a necked-up version of the 7.65 mm round. Fifty of these were tested as well by the U.S. Army in 1903. American units fighting guerrillas in the Moro Rebellion in Sulu during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War using the then-standard Colt M1892 revolver, .38 Long Colt, found it to be unsuitable for the rigors of jungle warfare, particularly in terms of stopping power, as the Moros had high battle morale and often used drugs to inhibit the sensation of pain.Linn, Brian McAllister. The Philippine War, 1899‚Äì1902 (Modern War Studies (Paperback)). University Press of Kansas. . The U.S. Army briefly reverted to using the M1873 single-action revolver in .45 Colt caliber, which had been standard during the late 19th century; the heavier bullet was found to be more effective against charging tribesmen. The problems prompted the Chief of Ordnance, General William Crozier, to authorize further testing for a new service pistol. Following the 1904 Thompson-LaGarde pistol round effectiveness tests, Colonel John T. Thompson stated that the new pistol \\"should not be of less than .45 caliber\\" and would preferably be semi- automatic in operation. This led to the 1906 trials of pistols from six firearms manufacturing companies (namely, Colt, Bergmann, Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM), Savage Arms Company, Knoble, Webley, and White- Merrill). Of the six designs submitted, three were eliminated early on, leaving only the Savage, Colt, and DWM designs chambered in the new .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge. These three still had issues that needed correction, but only Colt and Savage resubmitted their designs. There is some debate over the reasons for DWM's withdrawal‚Äîsome say they felt there was bias and that the DWM design was being used primarily as a \\"whipping boy\\" for the Savage and Colt pistols,Hallock, Kenneth R. (1980), Hallock's .45 Auto Handbook. though this does not fit well with the earlier 1900 purchase of the DWM design over the Colt and Steyr entries. In any case, a series of field tests from 1907 to 1911 were held to decide between the Savage and Colt designs. Both designs were improved between each round of testing, leading up to the final test before adoption. Among the areas of success for the Colt was a test at the end of 1910 attended by its designer, John Browning. 6000 rounds were fired from a single pistol over the course of 2 days. When the gun began to grow hot, it was simply immersed in water to cool it. The Colt gun passed with no reported malfunctions, while the Savage designs had 37. =Service history= A government-issue 'Model of 1911' pistol (serial number: 94854) manufactured in 1914. Comparison of government-issue M1911 (top) and M1911A1 pistols M15 General Officers adopted by the U.S. Army in the 1970s for issue to Generals. Following its success in trials, the Colt pistol was formally adopted by the Army on March 29, 1911, when it was designated Model of 1911, later changed to Model 1911, in 1917, and then M1911, in the mid-1920s. The Director of Civilian Marksmanship began manufacture of M1911 pistols for members of the National Rifle Association in August 1912. Approximately 100 pistols stamped \\"N.R.A.\\" below the serial number were manufactured at Springfield Armory and by Colt.Ness, Mark American Rifleman June 1983 p. 58 The M1911 was formally adopted by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in 1913. The .45 ACP \\"Model of 1911 U.S. Army\\" was used by both US Army Cavalry Troops and Infantry Soldiers during the United States' Punitive Expedition into Mexico against Pancho Villa in 1916. World War I By the beginning of 1917, a total of 68,533 M1911 pistols had been delivered to U.S. armed forces by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company and the U.S. government's Springfield Armory. However, the need to greatly expand U.S. military forces and the resultant surge in demand for the firearm in World War I saw the expansion of manufacture to other contractors besides Colt and Springfield Armory, including Remington-UMC and North American Arms Co. of Quebec. Several other manufacturers were awarded contracts to produce the M1911, including the National Cash Register Company, the Savage Arms Company, the Caron Brothers Manufacturing of Montreal, the Burroughs Adding Machine Co., Winchester Repeating Arms Company, and the Lanston Monotype Company, but the signing of the Armistice resulted in the cancellation of the contracts before any pistols had been produced. Interwar changes Battlefield experience in World War I led to some more small external changes, completed in 1924. The new version received a modified type classification, M1911A1, in 1926 with a stipulation that M1911A1s should have serial numbers higher than 700,000 with lower serial numbers designated M1911.Canfield, Bruce N. American Rifleman June 2005, p. 26 The M1911A1 changes to the original design consisted of a shorter trigger, cutouts in the frame behind the trigger, an arched mainspring housing, a longer grip safety spur (to prevent hammer bite), a wider front sight, a shortened hammer spur, and simplified grip checkering (eliminating the \\"Double Diamond\\" reliefs). These changes were subtle and largely intended to make the pistol easier to shoot for those with smaller hands. Many persons unfamiliar with the design are often unable to tell the difference between the two versions at a glance. No significant internal changes were made, and parts remained interchangeable between the M1911 and the M1911A1. Working for the U.S. Ordnance Office, David Marshall Williams developed a .22 training version of the M1911 using a floating chamber to give the .22 long rifle rimfire recoil similar to the .45 version. As the Colt Service Ace, this was available both as a pistol and as a conversion kit for .45 M1911 pistols. Colt 1911 01 Before World War II, 500 M1911s were produced under license by the Norwegian arms factory Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk, as Automatisk Pistol Model 1912. Then, production moved to a modified version designated Pistol Model 1914 and unofficially known as \\"Kongsberg Colt\\". The Pistol M/1914 is noted for its unusual extended slide stop which was specified by Norwegian ordnance authorities. 22,000 were produced between 1914 and 1940 but production continued after the German occupation of Norway in 1940 and 10,000 were produced for the German armed forces as Pistole 657 (n). Between 1927 and 1966, 102,000 M1911 pistols were produced as Sistema Colt Modelo 1927 in Argentina, first by the Direcci√≥n General de Fabricaciones Militares. A similar gun, the Ballester‚ÄìMolina, was also designed and produced. The M1911 and M1911A1 pistols were also ordered from Colt or produced domestically in modified form by several other nations, including Brazil (M1937 contract pistol), Mexico (M1911 Mexican contract pistol and the Obreg√≥n pistol), and Spain (private manufacturers Star and Llama). World War II World War II and the years leading up to it created a great demand. During the war, about 1.9 million units were procured by the U.S. Government for all forces, production being undertaken by several manufacturers, including Remington Rand (900,000 produced), Colt (400,000), Ithaca Gun Company (400,000), Union Switch & Signal (50,000), and Singer (500). New M1911A1 pistols were given a parkerized metal finish instead of bluing, and the wood grip panels were replaced with panels made of brown plastic. The M1911A1 was a favored small arm of both US and allied military personnel during the war, in particular, the pistol was prized by some British commando units and Britain's highly covert Special Operations Executive, as well as South African Commonwealth forces.Dunlap, Roy, Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 160 So many 1911A1 pistols were produced during the war that the government canceled all postwar contracts for new production, instead choosing to rebuild existing pistols with new parts, which were then refinished and tested for functioning. From the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s thousands of 1911s and 1911A1s were refurbished at U.S. Arsenals and Service depots. These arsenal rebuilds consisted of anything from minor inspections to major overhauls of pistols returned from service use. Pistols that were refurbished at government arsenals will usually be marked on the frame/receiver with the arsenal's initials, such as RIA (Rock Island Armory) or SA (Springfield Armory). Among collectors today, the Singer-produced pistols in particular are highly prized, commanding high prices even in poor condition. General Officer's Model From 1943 to 1945 a fine-grade russet-leather M1916 pistol belt set was issued to some generals in the US Army. It was composed of a leather belt, leather enclosed flap-holster with braided leather tie-down leg strap, leather two- pocket magazine pouch, and a rope neck lanyard. The metal buckle and fittings were in gilded brass. The buckle had the seal of the U.S. on the center (or \\"male\\") piece and a laurel wreath on the circular (or \\"female\\") piece. The pistol was a standard-issue M1911A1 that came with a cleaning kit and three magazines. From 1972 to 1981 a modified M1911A1 called the RIA M15 General Officer's Model was issued to General Officers in the US Army and US Air Force. From 1982 to 1986 the regular M1911A1 was issued. Both came with a black leather belt, open holster with retaining strap, and a two-pocket magazine pouch. The metal buckle and fittings were similar to the M1916 General Officer's Model except it came in gold metal for the Army and in silver metal for the Air Force. Post World War II usage After World War II, the M1911 continued to be a mainstay of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. It was used during Desert Storm in specialized U.S. Army units and U.S. Navy Mobile Construction Battalions (Seabees), and has seen service in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, with U.S. Army Special Forces Groups and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Companies. However, by the late 1970s, the M1911A1 was acknowledged to be showing its age. Under political pressure from Congress to standardize on a single modern pistol design, the U.S. Air Force ran a Joint Service Small Arms Program to select a new semi-automatic pistol using the NATO-standard 9 mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. After trials, the Beretta 92S-1 was chosen. The Army contested this result and subsequently ran its own competition in 1981, the XM9 trials, eventually leading to the official adoption of the Beretta 92F on January 14, 1985. By the late 1980s production was ramping up despite a controversial XM9 retrial and a separate XM10 reconfirmation that was boycotted by some entrants of the original trials, cracks in the frames of some pre-M9 Beretta-produced pistols, and despite a problem with slide separation using higher-than-specified-pressure rounds that resulted in injuries to some U.S. Navy special operations operatives. This last issue resulted in an updated model that includes additional protection for the user, the 92FS, and updates to the ammunition used. During the Gulf War of 1990 to 1991, M1911A1s were deployed with reserve component U.S. Army units sent to participate in Operation Desert Storm. By the early 1990s, most M1911A1s had been replaced by the Beretta M9, though a limited number remain in use by special units. The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in particular were noted for continuing the use of M1911 pistols for selected personnel in MEU(SOC) and reconnaissance units (though the USMC also purchased over 50,000 M9 pistols.) For its part, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) issued a requirement for a .45 ACP pistol in the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) trials. This resulted in the Heckler & Koch OHWS becoming the MK23 Mod 0 Offensive Handgun Weapon System (itself being heavily based on the 1911's basic field strip), beating the Colt OHWS, a much-modified M1911. Dissatisfaction with the stopping power of the 9 mm Parabellum cartridge used in the Beretta M9 has actually promoted re-adoption of pistols based on the .45 ACP cartridge such as the M1911 design, along with other pistols, among USSOCOM units in recent years, though the M9 has been predominant both within SOCOM and in the U.S. military in general. Both U.S. Army Special Forces Units and SFOD-D continue to use modernized M1911s. MEU(SOC) pistol Marine Expeditionary Units formerly issued M1911s to Force Recon units. Hand-selected Colt M1911A1 frames were gutted, deburred, and prepared for additional use by the USMC Precision Weapon Section (PWS) at Marine Corps Base Quantico. They were then assembled with after-market grip safeties, ambidextrous thumb safeties, triggers, improved high-visibility sights, accurized barrels, grips, and improved Wilson magazines. These hand-made pistols were tuned to specifications and preferences of end users.Johnston, Gary Paul.(2004)\\"One Good Pistol\\", Soldier of Fortune Magazine, December 2004, 62‚Äì67 In the late 1980s, the Marines laid out a series of specifications and improvements to make Browning's design ready for 21st-century combat, many of which have been included in MEU(SOC) pistol designs, but design and supply time was limited. Discovering that the Los Angeles Police Department was pleased with their special Kimber M1911 pistols, a single source request was issued to Kimber for just such a pistol despite the imminent release of their TLE/RLII models.Rogers, Patrick A.(2003)\\"Marines New SOCOM Pistol\\", SWAT Magazine, December 2003, 52‚Äì57 Kimber shortly began producing a limited number of what would be later termed the Interim Close Quarters Battle pistol (ICQB). Maintaining the simple recoil assembly, 5-inch barrel (though using a stainless steel match grade barrel), and internal extractor, the ICQB is not much different from Browning's original design. In July 2012, the U.S. Marines placed a $22.5 million order with Colt for 12,000 M1911 pistols for MEU(SOC) forces. The new 1911 was designated M45A1 or \\"Close Quarters Battle Pistol\\" CQBP. The M45A1 features a dual recoil spring assembly, Picatinny rails and is cerakoted tan in color. M45A1 pistols continue to see usage today with USMC Force Recon Battalions, in addition to other specialized USMC units. =Current users in the U.S.= Many military and law enforcement organizations in the U.S. and other countries continue to use (often modified) M1911A1 pistols including Los Angeles Police Department SWAT and S.I.S., the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, FBI regional SWAT teams, and 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment‚ÄîDelta (Delta Force). A basic version of Smith & Wesson's SW1911 with user-installed Pachmayr grips. M1911 by Springfield Armory, Inc. (contemporary remake of the World War II G.I. Model, parkerized). The M1911A1 is popular among the general public in the U.S. for practical and recreational purposes. The pistol is commonly used for concealed carry thanks in part to a single-stack magazine (which makes for a thinner pistol that is, therefore, easier to conceal), personal defense, target shooting, and competition as well as collections. Numerous aftermarket accessories allow users to customize the pistol to their liking. There are a growing number of manufacturers of M1911-type pistols and the model continues to be quite popular for its reliability, simplicity, and patriotic appeal. Various tactical, target and compact models are available. Price ranges from a low end of around $400 for basic pistols imported from the Philippines or Turkey (Armscor, Tisas, Rock Island Armory, Girsan, STI Spartan, Seraphim Armoury) to more than $4,000 for the best competition or tactical versions (Wilson Combat, Ed Brown, Les Baer, Nighthawk Custom, and STI International). Due to an increased demand for M1911 pistols among Army Special Operations units, who are known to field a variety of M1911 pistols, the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit began looking to develop a new generation of M1911s and launched the M1911-A2 project in late 2004. The goal was to produce a minimum of seven variants with various sights, internal and external extractors, flat and arched mainspring housings, integral and add-on magazine wells, a variety of finishes and other options, with the idea of providing the end-user a selection from which to select the features that best fit their missions. The AMU performed a well- received demonstration of the first group of pistols to the Marine Corps at Quantico and various Special Operations units at Ft. Bragg and other locations. The project provided a feasibility study with insight into future projects. Models were loaned to various Special Operations units, the results of which are classified. An RFP was issued for a Joint Combat Pistol but it was ultimately canceled. Currently units are experimenting with an M1911 pistol in .40 which will incorporate lessons learned from the A2 project. Ultimately, the M1911A2 project provided a testbed for improving existing M1911s. An improved M1911 variant becoming available in the future is a possibility. The Springfield Custom Professional Model 1911A1 pistol is produced under contract by Springfield Armory for the FBI regional SWAT teams and the Hostage Rescue Team. This pistol is made in batches on a regular basis by the Springfield Custom Shop, and a few examples from most runs are made available for sale to the general public at a selling price of approximately US$2,700 each. =International users= Colt 1911 British Service Model, cal .455 Webley Auto * Bangladesh still uses USGI M1911s supplied as military aid during the Vietnam War era while Rapid Action Battalion (RAB Forces), an anti- terrorist police tactical team in Bangladesh uses this weapon. * The Brazilian company IMBEL (Ind√∫stria de Material B√©lico do Brasil) still produces the pistol in several variants for civilian, military and law enforcement uses in .45 ACP, .40 S&W;, .380 ACP and 9 mm calibers.

China has also manufactured conversion kits to chamber the 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev round following the Korean War. : As of 2013, the pistol is made under license instead of copying with Colt manufacturing machinery, due to an agreement between Norinco and Colt in order to stop Norinco from producing the Norinco CQ rifle. Importation into the United States was blocked by trade rules in 1993 but Norinco still manages to import the weapon into Canada and successfully adopted by IPSC shooters, gunsmiths and firearms enthusiasts there because of the cheaper price of the pistol than the other M1911s. * The German Volkssturm used captured M1911s at the end of World War II under the weapon code P.660(a), in which the letter 'a' refers to \\"Amerika,\\" the weapon's country of origin. * The Greek Hellenic Army issues the World War II production American M1911 as a sidearm.

Later, some ex-US Navy Colts were transferred with ex-US ships. Argentina produced under license some 102,494 M1911A1s as Model 1927 Sistema Colt, which eventually led to production of the cheaper Ballester‚ÄìMolina, which resembles the 1911. * The Armed Forces of the Philippines issues Mil-spec M1911A1 pistols as a sidearm to the special forces, military police, and officers. These pistols are mostly produced by Colt, though some of them are produced locally by Armscor, a Philippine company specialized in making 1911-style pistols. The Indonesian Army issued a locally produced version of the Colt M1911A1, chambered in .45 ACP along with the Pindad P1, the locally manufactured Browning Hi-Power pistol as the standard-issue sidearm. * In the 1950s, the Republic of China Army (Taiwan) used original M1911A1s, and the batches are now still used by some forces. In 1962, Taiwan copied the M1911A1 as the T51 pistol, and it saw limited use in the Army. After that, the T51 was improved and introduced for export as the T51K1.

Replacement sights, grips, and other aftermarket accessories are the most commonly offered parts. Since the 1950s and the rise of competitive pistol shooting, many companies have been offering the M1911 as a base model for major customization. These modifications can range from changing the external finish, checkering the frame, and hand fitting custom hammers, triggers, and sears. Some modifications include installing compensators and the addition of accessories such as tactical lights and even scopes. A common modification of John Browning's design is to use a full- length guide rod that runs the full length of the recoil spring. This adds weight to the front of the pistol, but does not increase accuracy, and does make the pistol slightly more difficult to disassemble. Custom guns can cost over $5,000 and are built from scratch or on existing base models. The main companies offering custom M1911s are: Dan Wesson Firearms, Ed Brown, Les Baer, Nighthawk Custom, Springfield Custom Shop, STI International, and Wilson Combat. IPSC models are offered by both Strayer Voigt Inc (Infinity Firearms) and STI International.

Springfield Mil Spec field stripped Parkerized ATI M1911A1 Government, Series 70 GI reproduction. Manufactured 2017. Browning's basic M1911 design has seen very little change throughout its production life. The basic principle of the pistol is recoil operation. As the expanding combustion gases force the bullet down the barrel, they give reverse momentum to the slide and barrel which are locked together during this portion of the firing cycle. After the bullet has left the barrel, the slide and barrel continue rearward a short distance. At this point, a link pivots the rear of the barrel down, out of locking recesses in the slide, and the barrel is stopped by making contact with the lower barrel lugs against the frame. As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the firing chamber and an ejector strikes the rear of the case, pivoting it out and away from the pistol through the ejection port. The slide stops its rearward motion then, and is propelled forward again by the recoil spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber. At the forward end of its travel, the slide locks into the barrel and is ready to fire again. However, if the fired round was the last round in the magazine, the slide will lock in the rearward position, which notifies the shooter to reload by ejecting the empty magazine and inserting a loaded magazine, and facilitates (by being rearwards) reloading the chamber, which is accomplished by either pulling the slide back slightly and releasing, or by pushing down on the slide stop, which releases the slide to move forward under spring pressure, strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber. There are no fasteners of any type in the 1911 design, excepting the grip screws. The main components of the gun are held in place by the force of the main spring. The pistol can be \\"field stripped\\" by partially retracting the slide, removing the slide stop, and subsequently removing the barrel bushing. Full disassembly (and subsequent reassembly) of the pistol to its component parts can be accomplished using several manually removed components as tools to complete the disassembly. The military mandated a grip safety and a manual safety. A grip safety, sear disconnect, slide stop, half cock position, and manual safety (located on the left rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911A1s. Several companies have developed a firing pin block safety. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers, including Kimber and Smith & Wesson, use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety.U.S. Patent 2,169,084 (1939)Davis and Raynor(1976), Safe Pistols Made Even Safer, American Rifleman, Jan. 1976 Language cautioning against pulling the trigger with the second finger was included in the initial M1911 manual, (published in 1917) and later manuals up to the 1940s. The same basic design has been offered commercially and has been used by other militaries. In addition to the .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), models chambered for .38 Super, 9√ó19mm Parabellum, 7.65mm Parabellum, 9mm Steyr, .400 Corbon, and other cartridges were offered. The M1911 was developed from earlier Colt semi- automatic designs, firing rounds such as .38 ACP. The design beat out many other contenders during the government's selection period, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, up to the pistol's adoption. The M1911 officially replaced a range of revolvers and pistols across branches of the U.S. armed forces, though a number of other designs have seen use in certain niches. Despite being challenged by newer and lighter weight pistol designs in .45 caliber, such as the Glock 21, the SIG Sauer P220, the Springfield XD and the Heckler & Koch USP, the M1911 shows no signs of decreasing popularity and continues to be widely present in various competitive matches such as those of USPSA, IDPA, IPSC, and Bullseye.

The park preserves Biscayne Bay and its offshore barrier reefs. Ninety-five percent of the park is water, and the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive mangrove forest. The park covers and includes Elliott Key, the park's largest island and northernmost of the true Florida Keys, formed from fossilized coral reef. The islands farther north in the park are transitional islands of coral and sand. The offshore portion of the park includes the northernmost region of the Florida Reef, one of the largest coral reefs in the world. Biscayne National Park protects four distinct ecosystems: the shoreline mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps of the mainland and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators. The people of the Glades culture inhabited the Biscayne Bay region as early as 10,000 years ago before rising sea levels filled the bay. The Tequesta people occupied the islands and shoreline from about 4,000 years before the present to the 16th century, when the Spanish took possession of Florida. Reefs claimed ships from Spanish times through the 20th century, with more than 40 documented wrecks within the park's boundaries. While the park's islands were farmed during the 19th and early 20th centuries, their rocky soil and periodic hurricanes made agriculture difficult to sustain. In the early 20th century the islands became secluded destinations for wealthy Miamians who built getaway homes and social clubs. Mark C. Honeywell's guesthouse on Boca Chita Key that featured a mock lighthouse was the area's most elaborate private retreat. The Cocolobo Cay Club was at various times owned by Miami developer Carl G. Fisher, yachtsman Garfield Wood, and President Richard Nixon's friend Bebe Rebozo, and was visited by four United States presidents. The amphibious community of Stiltsville, established in the 1930s in the shoals of northern Biscayne Bay, took advantage of its remoteness from land to offer offshore gambling and alcohol during Prohibition. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the Central Intelligence Agency and Cuban exile groups used Elliott Key as a training ground for infiltrators into Fidel Castro's Cuba. Originally proposed for inclusion in Everglades National Park, Biscayne Bay was removed from the proposed park to ensure Everglades' establishment. The area remained undeveloped until the 1960s, when a series of proposals were made to develop the keys in the manner of Miami Beach, and to construct a deepwater seaport for bulk cargo, along with refinery and petrochemical facilities on the mainland shore of Biscayne Bay. Through the 1960s and 1970s, two fossil-fueled power plants and two nuclear power plants were built on the bay shores. A backlash against development led to the 1968 designation of Biscayne National Monument. The preserved area was expanded by its 1980 re-designation as Biscayne National Park. The park is heavily used by boaters, and apart from the park's visitor center on the mainland, its land and sea areas are accessible only by boat. Geography Map of Biscayne National Park. Also see resolution adjustable pdf map. Biscayne National Park comprises in Miami-Dade County in southeast Florida. Extending from just south of Key Biscayne southward to just north of Key Largo, the park includes Soldier Key, the Ragged Keys, Sands Key, Elliott Key, Totten Key and Old Rhodes Key, as well as smaller islands that form the northernmost extension of the Florida Keys. The Safety Valve, a wide shallow opening in the island chain, between the Ragged Keys and Key Biscayne just north of the park's boundary, allows storm surge water to flow out of the bay after the passage of tropical storms. The park's eastern boundary is the ten-fathom line () of water depth in the Atlantic Ocean on the Florida Reef. The park's western boundary is a fringe of property on the mainland, extending a few hundred meters inland between Cutler Ridge and Mangrove Point. The only direct mainland access to the park is at the Convoy Point Visitor Center, adjacent to the park headquarters. The southwestern boundary adjoins the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station and its system of cooling canals. The southern portion of Biscayne Bay extends between Elliott Key and the mainland, transited by the Intracoastal Waterway. The park abuts the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary on the east and south sides of the park and John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park to the south. Only of the park's area are on land, with the offshore keys comprising and mainland mangrove swamps account for the remaining . As an extension of the Everglades ecosystem, much of the park was originally proposed to be included in Everglades National Park, but was excluded to obtain a consensus for the establishment of the Everglades park in 1947.Grunwald, p. 214 =Geology= Underwater view of a coral reef at Biscayne National Park Biscayne Bay marks the southernmost extent of the Atlantic barrier islands, represented by Key Biscayne, and the northernmost extent of the Florida Keys at Elliott Key. The keys are distinguished from the barrier islands by the coral limestone that extends to the islands' surface under a thin veneer of topsoil, while the barrier islands are dominated by wave-deposited sands that cover most of the limestones.Bryan et al., p. 288 Biscayne Bay lies between low ridges of oolitic Miami Limestone on the west, forming Cutler Ridge, and the coral-based Key Largo Limestone that underlies Elliott Key and the keys to the south. The Miami Limestone was deposited in turbulent lagoon waters. The Key Largo Limestone is a fossilized coral reef formed during the Sangamonian Stage of about 75,000 to 125,000 years ago. The Miami Formation achieved its present form somewhat later, during a glacial period in which fresh water consolidated and cemented the lagoon deposits.Bryan et al., pp. 287‚Äì290 The Key Largo Limestone is a coarse stone formed from stony corals, between in thickness.Bryan et al., p. 298 As a consequence of their origins as reefs, the beaches of Elliott Key and Old Rhodes Key are rocky. Significant sandy beaches are found only at Sands Key. =Hydrology= Biscayne Bay is a shallow semi- enclosed lagoon which averages in depth. Both its mainland margins and the keys are covered by mangrove forest. The park includes the southern portion of Biscayne Bay, with areas of thin sediment called \\"hardbottom\\", and vegetated seagrass meadows supporting turtlegrass and shoal grass. As a result of efforts to control water resources in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of water out of the southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay.NPCA, p. 2 The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.NPCA, p. 13 Human history =Native people= Piles of conch and whelk shells left behind by Native Americans Native Americans were present in lower Florida 10,000 years ago, when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was comparatively empty of water. Water levels rose from about 4000 years ago and inundated the bay. Archeologists believe any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The Cutler Fossil Site, just to the west of the park, has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000 years before the present.Leynes, Cullison, Chapter 2, pp. 9‚Äì10 The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500 years before the present, with piles of conch and whelk shells left by the Glades culture. The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community that lived on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity. A site on Sands Key has yielded potsherds, worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000 AD to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans. Fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.NPCA, p. 33 =Exploration= Juan Ponce de Le√≥n explored the area in 1513, discovering the Florida Keys and encountering the Tequesta on the mainland. Other Spanish explorers arrived later in the 16th century and Florida came under Spanish rule. The Tequesta were resettled by the then-Spanish government in the Florida Keys, and the South Florida mainland was depopulated. Ponce de Le√≥n referred to the bay as \\"Chequescha\\" after its inhabitants, becoming \\"Tequesta\\" by the time of Spanish governor Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s later in the century. The present name has been attributed to a shipwrecked Basque sailor known as the \\"Biscaino\\" or \\"Viscayno\\" who lived in the area for a time, or to a more general allusion to the Bay of Biscay. Spanish treasure fleets regularly sailed past the Florida Keys and were often caught in hurricanes. There are 44 documented shipwrecks in the park from the 16th through the 20th centuries. At least two 18th-century Spanish ships were wrecked in the park area.Miller, p. 6 The Spanish galleon Nuestra Senora del Popolo is believed to have been wrecked in park waters in 1733, though the site has not been found. HMS Fowey was wrecked in 1748NPCA, p. 32 in what is now Legare Anchorage, at some distance from the Fowey Rocks. The discovery of the ship in 1975 resulted in a landmark court case that established the wreck as an archaeological site rather than a salvage site. 43 wrecks are included on the National Register of Historic Places in the Offshore Reefs Archeological District, which extends for along the seaward side of the Biscayne National Park keys.Leynes, Cullison, Chapter 2, p. 12 During the 18th century, Elliott Key was the reputed base of two different pirates, both called Black Caesar, commemorated by Caesar's Creek between Elliott and Old Rhodes Key.Miller, p. 9 =Settlement and pre-park use= The first permanent European settlers in the Miami area did not come until the early 19th century. The first settlements around Biscayne Bay were small farms on Elliott Key growing crops like key limes and pineapples. John James Audubon visited Elliott Key in 1832.Miller, p. 11 Colonel Robert E. Lee surveyed the area around Biscayne Bay for potential fortification sites in 1849. At the end of the American Civil War in 1865, a number of Confederates passed through the area as they were attempting to escape to Cuba. Elliott Key was a brief stopping point for John C. Breckinridge during his flight to Cuba. The former United States vice president, Confederate general and Confederate secretary of war spent two nights in Biscayne Bay on his journey.Leynes, Cullison, Chapter 2, p. 13 Few people lived in the park area until 1897, when Israel Lafayette Jones, an African-American property manager, bought Porgy Key for $300 US. The next year Jones bought the adjoining Old Rhodes Key and moved his family there, clearing land to grow limes and pineapples. In 1911 Jones bought Totten Key, which had been used as a pineapple plantation, for a dollar an acre, selling in 1925 for $250,000.Shumaker, p. 53 Before Israel Jones' death in 1932 the Jones plantations were for a while among the largest lime producers on the Florida east coast.Shumaker, p. 55 U.S. President Warren G. Harding and fishing party at the Cocolobo Cay Club Carl G. Fisher, who was responsible for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, Will Rogers and Frank Seiberling.Miller, pp.19‚Äì20Shumaker, p. 57 Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934.Shumaker, p. 59 Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by the Joneses included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s.Shumaker, p. 61 During the Cold War the future park area was a training ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for Bay of Pigs invasion. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.Hach, pp. 35‚Äì36 =Proposed development= Boca Chita Key lighthouse and the Miami skyline As modern communities grew in and around Miami, developers looked to southern Dade County for new projects. The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. Beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted the construction of a causeway to the mainland. One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the Overseas Highway at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north.Miller, pp. 17‚Äì18 At the same time, pressure built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida. This led to competing priorities between those who wanted to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development. On December 6, 1960, 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of Islandia on Elliott Key. The town was incorporated to encourage Dade County to improve access to Elliott Key in particular, which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach. The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers. In 1962 an industrial seaport was proposed for the mainland shores of Biscayne Bay, to be known as SeaDade. SeaDade, supported by billionaire shipping magnate Daniel K. Ludwig, would have included an oil refinery. In addition to the physical structures, it would have been necessary to dredge a channel through the bay for large ships to access the refinery. The channel would have also required cutting through the coral reef to get to the deep water. In 1963 Florida Power and Light (FP&L;) announced plans for two new 400-megawatt oil-fired power plants on undeveloped land at Turkey Point.Miller, p. 46 Many local residents and politicians supported SeaDade because it would have created additional jobs, but a group of early environmentalists thought the costs were too high. They fought against development of the bay and formed the Safe Progress Association. Led by Lloyd Miller, the president of the local chapter of the Izaak Walton League, Miami Herald reporter Juanita Greene, and Art Marshall, the opponents of industrialization proposed the creation of a national park unit that would protect the reefs, islands and bay. After initial skepticism, the park proposal obtained the support of Miami Herald editors, as well as Florida Congressman Dante Fascell and Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr., and were supported by lobbying efforts by sympathetic businessmen including Herbert Hoover, Jr. One vision of Islandia, supported by land owners, would have connected the northern Florida Keys ‚Äì from Key Biscayne to Key Largo ‚Äì with bridges and created new islands using the fill from the SeaDade channel. Although Miami-area politicians and the state of Florida did not support Ludwig's SeaDade plans, Islandia's supporters continued to lobby for development support. In 1968, when it appeared the area was about to become a national monument, Islandia supporters bulldozed a highway six lanes wide down the center of the island, destroying the forest for . Islandia landowners called it Elliott Key Boulevard, but called it \\"Spite Highway\\" privately. It was hoped that since there was so much environmental damage, no one would want it for a national monument. Over time in the near-tropical climate, the forest grew back and now the only significant hiking trail on Elliott Key now follows the path of Elliott Key Boulevard. Turkey Point Power Station from the park visitor center The oil-fired Turkey Point power stations were completed in 1967‚Äì68 and experienced immediate problems from the discharge of hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses.Miller, pp. 48, 59, 61, 64 In 1964 FP&L; announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site,Miller, p. 48 which were expected to compound the cooling water problem. Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the power stations were projected to consume a significant proportion of the bay's waters each day for cooling. After extensive negotiations and litigation with both the state and with Ludwig, who owned lands needed for cooling water canals, a closed-loop canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.Miller, pp. 69, 76‚Äì79 Portions of the present park were used for recreation prior to the park's establishment. Homestead Bayfront Park, still operated by Miami-Dade County just south of Convoy Point, established a \\"blacks-only\\" segregated beach for African-Americans at the present site of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center. The segregated beach operated through the 1950s into the early 1960s before segregated public facilities were abolished. =Park establishment and history= Biscayne National Monument as proposed in 1966 The earliest proposals for the protection of Biscayne Bay were part of proposals by Everglades National Park advocate Ernest F. Coe, whose proposed Everglades park boundaries included Biscayne Bay, its keys, interior country including what are now Homestead and Florida City, and Key Largo. Biscayne Bay, Key Largo and the adjoining inland extensions were cut from Everglades National Park before its establishment in 1947. When proposals to develop Elliott Key surfaced in 1960, Lloyd Miller asked Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall to send a Park Service reconnaissance team to review the Biscayne Bay area for inclusion in the national park system. A favorable report ensued, and with financial help from Herbert Hoover, Jr., political support was solicited, most notably from Congressman Fascell. A area of Elliott Key was by this time a part of the Dade County park system. The 1966 report noted the proposed park contained the best remaining areas of tropical forest in Florida and a rare combination of \\"terrestrial, marine and amphibious life,\\" as well as significant recreational value. The report found the most significant virtues of the potential park were \\"the clear, sparkling waters, marine life, and the submerged lands of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Here in shallow water is a veritable wonderland.\\" President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Public Law 90-606 to create Biscayne National Monument on October 18, 1968. The monument was expanded in 1974 under Public Law 93-477 and expanded again when the monument was redesignated a national park by an act of Congress through Public Law 96-287, effective June 28, 1980. The 1980 expansion extended the park almost to Key Biscayne and included Boca Chita Key, the Ragged Keys and the Safety Valve shoal region, together with the corresponding offshore reefs and a substantial portion of central Biscayne Bay.NPS, Draft General Management Plan, pp. 295‚Äì299NPCA, p. 9 The first Islandia property owner to sell land to the National Park Service was Lancelot Jones, together with Katherine Jones, Arthur's widow. They sold their lands for $1,272,500, about a third of the potential development value. Jones was given a life estate on at the age of 70. He visited with park rangers stationed at the former Cocolobo Club, which eventually burned down in 1975. The other life estate in the park was held by Virginia Tannehill, the widow of Eastern Airlines executive Paul Tannehill.Shumaker, p. 64 Jones' house built by Lancelot, his father and his brother, burned down in 1982. He lived in a two-room shack for the next ten years, riding out hurricanes on Porgy Key, but left his home permanently just before Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The house was destroyed and Jones remained in Miami until his death in 1997 at 99 years.Shumaker, p. 66 Deprived of a rationale for existence by the national monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney's office, headed by Janet Reno. In 1990 Reno's office determined after investigation that all of the town's elections were invalid, since the elections were restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012. The impact of Hurricane Andrew on neighboring Homestead Air Force Base caused the Air Force to consider closing the base and conveying it to Miami-Dade County, which was interested in using the base for commercial air traffic as an alternative to Miami International Airport. An environmental impact study concluded the resulting flight paths over the bay, only to the east, would result in degradation of the park. In 1999 The Air Force prohibited major commercial development at Homestead as a result.Miller, pp. 137‚Äì139 Columbus Day boating crowd The park's popularity as a destination for boaters has led to a high rate of accidents, some of them fatal. The Columbus Day weekend has been cited as the \\"most dangerous weekend of the year.\\" An annual boating regatta in its 57th year in 2012 resulted in six deaths between 2002 and 2011, with damage to seabeds from vessel groundings and littering. Although official regatta activities take place outside the park, the area of Elliott Key has become a popular destination for some participants. A fifth generating unit fueled by natural gas and oil was added to the Turkey Point generating station in 2007. In 2009, Turkey Point was proposed as the site of two new 1117 MW AP1000 nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami- Dade County, a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary at Black Point, and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.NPCA, p. 14 Activities A park ranger shows underwater life to a visitor using a glass-bottomed bucket. Biscayne National Park operates year-round. Camping is most practical in winter months, when mosquitoes are less troublesome on the keys. Private concessioners provide full day tours in the park that include snorkeling, hiking, paddling and sailing from the park headquarters. Boat excursions to Boca Chita and Adams Key are also available. =Recreation= Access to the park from the mainland is limited to the immediate vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling and scuba diving. Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near the park. Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent to the park headquarters at Convoy Point. Farther south Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys. Matheson Hammock Park is near the north end of the park, and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne. Although it is a federally designated park, fishing within Biscayne is governed by the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, spiny lobster, stone crab, blue crab and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary, administered by the state of Florida to protect spiny lobster breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay. A private concessioner provides tours from the Park headquarters into the bay and to the keys. Most tours are operated during the peak winter season from January to April. Personal watercraft are prohibited in Biscayne and most other national parks,NPS, Draft General Management Plan, p. 12 but other private powerboats and sailboats are permitted. =Island facilities= Most of Biscayne's permanent facilities are on the offshore keys. A seasonally staffed ranger station is on Elliott Key, as well as a campground and 36 boat slips. A single loop trail runs from the harbor to the oceanfront, and a path following the Spite Highway runs the length of the island. Adams Key is a day-use-only area for visitors, although two Park Service residences are on the island. Boca Chita Key is the most-visited island, with a campground and picnic areas. The Boca Chita Lighthouse is occasionally open to visitors when staffing permits. =Snorkeling and diving= Snorkeling and scuba diving on the offshore reefs are popular activities. The reefs have been the cause of many shipwrecks. A selection of wrecks have been the subjects of ranger-led snorkeling tours and have been organized as the Maritime Heritage Trail, the only underwater archaeological trail in the National Park Service system. The wrecks of the Arratoon Apcar (sank 1878), Erl King (1891), Alicia (1905), Lugano (1913) and Mandalay (1966) are on the trail together with an unknown wreck from the 1800s and the Fowey Rocks Lighthouse. The Alicia, Erl King and Lugano are relatively deep wrecks, best suited for scuba dives. The Mandalay is at a shallower depth and is especially popular for snorkeling. Historical structures Stiltsville as seen from Cape Florida Although most of Biscayne National Park's area is water, the islands have a number of protected historical structures and districts. Shipwrecks are also protected within the park, and the park's offshore waters are a protected historic district. =Stiltsville= The ornamental lighthouse at Boca Chita Key Stiltsville was established by Eddie \\"Crawfish\\" Walker in the 1930s as a small community of shacks built on pilings in a shallow section of Biscayne Bay, not far from Key Biscayne. Comprising 27 structures at its height in the 1960s, Stiltsville lost shacks to fires and hurricanes, with only seven surviving in 2012, none of them dating to the 1960s or earlier. The site was incorporated into Biscayne National Park in 1985, when the Park Service agreed to honor existing leases until July 1, 1999. Hurricane Andrew destroyed most of Stiltsville in 1992. The Park Service has undertaken to preserve the community, which is now unoccupied. The community is to be administered by a trust and used as accommodation for overnight camping, educational facilities and researchers. =Other structures= Biscayne National Park includes a number of navigational aids, as well as an ornamental structure built to resemble a lighthouse. The Fowey Rocks Light is a skeleton-frame cast iron structure built in 1878. Already included within the boundaries of the park, the light was acquired by the Park Service on October 2, 2012. The unmanned Pacific Reef Light is about three miles (5 km) offshore from Elliott Key. The original 1921 structure was replaced in 2000 and its lantern was placed on display in a park in Islamorada. Industrialist Mark C. Honeywell was a Cocolobo Club member who bought Boca Chita Key in 1937, expanding the facilities to include a small lighthouse.Shumaker, pp. 59‚Äì60 Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including an imitation lighthouse, built using coral rock and topped with a wire cage resembling a lighthouse lantern, and the end of a jetty on the north side of the key. The key was owned by Honeywell until 1945. Mark and Olive Honeywell also built a chapel, a guesthouse, seawalls and utility buildings on the island.NPCA, p. 29 The Boca Chita Key structures are administered as a cultural landscape, interpreting the area's use as a retreat for the rich. More modest homesteads include the now-abandoned plantations developed by Israel Jones and his sons, and the Sweeting Homestead on Elliott Key. The frame structures associated with these plantations, together with those of the Cocolobo Cay Club and frame buildings on Boca Chita Key, have been destroyed by fire and hurricanes.NPS, Draft General Management Plan, p. 151 Ecology Snorkelers and elkhorn coral South Florida is a transitional zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical realms, resulting in a wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of realms brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in. Hundreds of species of fish are present in park waters, including more than fifty crustacean species ranging from isopods to giant blue land crabs, about two hundred species of birds and about 27 mammal species, both terrestrial and marine. Molluscs include a variety of bivalves, terrestrial and marine snails, sea hares, sea slugs and two cephalopods, the Caribbean reef octopus and the Caribbean reef squid. The sheltered open waters of the bay and the outlying chain of keys provide resting areas for migrating birds on their way between North American, the Caribbean islands, and South America. Many southbound land birds stop in the fall at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, just north of the park on Key Biscayne, before venturing across the open waters of Biscayne Bay. Northbound spring migrants do likewise on Elliott Key. Most of the small passerine migrants are warblers, with ovenbirds, palm warblers, American redstarts, common yellowthroats, prairie warblers, worm-eating warblers and black- throated blue warblers accounting for the majority. Migrant raptors include short-tailed hawks, sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, peregrine falcons and swallow-tailed kites, while bald eagles and ospreys nest in the park. Both white-tailed and red-tailed tropicbirds are seen in the park, as are American flamingos, with some of the latter probably escaped captive birds. =Shoreline and mangrove swamp= The mainland shorelines are dominated by a marshy transitional zone chiefly populated by red mangrove and black mangrove growing from the shallow water, with white mangrove growing farther back from the water's edge. The trees' aerial root structure provides a sheltered habitat for crabs, fish and wading birds. The brown waters within the mangrove thickets are nurseries for fish, mollusc and crustacean larvae that require a quiet sheltered environment before the immature animals can disperse into open waters. Mangroves shed leaves at about per year, providing food for fish, worms and crustaceans. Because the carbon in the leaves is sequestered by incorporation into animals, the mangrove swamp is estimated to have two to three times the ability to sequester carbon of terrestrial forests. The mangrove forest on Biscayne Bay is the longest on Florida's east coast. Shoreline and island mangrove swamps, together with the bay, represent a significant nursery for the marine life of southeast Florida.NPCA, p. 1 American crocodile The salt-tolerant mangrove margin has expanded inland as freshwater flow into the bay has been channelized, replacing freshwater sawgrass marshes. The L-31E coastal storm surge levee inland of the park's western boundary has played a significant role in isolating former freshwater marshlands from their water sources. At the same time, tidal water does not reach the interior of the coastal margin, limiting interchange between salt and freshwater ecosystems.NPCA, p. 16 Bird life on the shoreline includes yellow-crowned night herons, loggerhead shrikes, prairie warblers and shorebirds. Mangrove cuckoos, a notoriously difficult-to-observe species, may be seen at Convoy Point and Black Point. Biscayne has one of the largest populations of mangrove cuckoos in Florida. The park's margins are habitat for the threatened American crocodile. The construction of miles of cooling water canals in the marl lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant, and the canals' warm waters, have provided a nearly ideal environment for crocodile nesting, making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park. Although crocodiles and American alligators both occur in extreme southern Florida, alligators are uncommon in Biscayne, since alligators mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland, while crocodiles can live in Biscayne's somewhat saltier estuarine waters. =Bay waters= Manatees in Biscayne Bay The open waters are inhabited by fishes, molluscs and crustaceans living on sea grasses or who prey on each other. The shallowness of the lagoon makes it suitable habitat for diving birds such as anhinga, cormorants and diving ducks. The bay also provides habitat for juvenile sea animals that have left the shelter of the mangrove belts. Manatees frequent the quiet waters of the bay. The bay has a year-round population of double- crested cormorants. Winter residents include northern gannets, American white pelicans and common loons. The bay also has a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins. Biscayne Bay is a shallow lagoon with little vertical density or salinity gradient due to its lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals on the west side and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum. Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper.NPCA, p. 23 The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. The endangered Johnson's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is at the southern end of the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses.NPCA, p. 20 Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years.NPCA, p. 21 The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling, which is permitted in park waters. The passage of roller-frame trawl nets does not harm grasses, but damages soft corals and sponges.NPCA, p. 27 =Keys= Totten Key and reefs Elliott Key is the largest island in the park, measuring and about long by wide. Next largest is Old Rhodes Key at , then Sands Key , Totten Key and Little Totten Key at , with 37 smaller islands arranged in a north-south line east of the mainland shoreline. The keys shift from barrier islands with rocky cores in the north to coral rock platforms in the south. All are fringed with mangroves, with subtropical vegetation and hardwood forests in the interiors, including gumbo limbo, mahogany, ironwood, torchwood and satinleaf. Insects include Schaus' swallowtail, an endangered species, as well as dense clouds of mosquitoes in the wet season, preyed upon by dragonflies. Marsh rabbits and raccoons, together with mice and rats comprise the primary mammalian species. Reptiles include rattlesnakes and a variety of lizards, as well as an occasional crocodile. The keys are a transitional area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland. The interior of the keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for ruddy turnstones and least sandpipers. Gulls and terns include royal terns, laughing gulls and ring- billed gulls, with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones are closed during breeding season. The semaphore prickly-pear cactus is only found in and near Biscayne National Park and may be the rarest plant in the U.S. Sea turtles nest on island beaches in the park. Park staff actively assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose an obstacle to adults and hatchlings. Loggerhead turtles are the most common sea turtle species and account for nearly all of the turtle nests in the park. Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with mesh screen against the predation by abundant raccoon population. Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100% of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007, with a more usual average of more than 50% nest disturbance in most years. In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected, five partially disturbed nests were protected, and one nest was destroyed by predators. The threatened eastern indigo snake is also present on the island.NPCA, p. 22 Rare and endangered plant species on the islands include Sargent's cherry palm and the semaphore prickly-pear cactus (Consolea corallicola). The cactus, which has been described as \\"near extinction\\", has been reduced to about 20 individuals. A colonial population of 570 cacti were found on one island in Biscayne Bay in 2001, making it the largest known population of semaphore prickly-pear cactus in the world. The only natural population of Sargent's palm grows on Elliott Key. Fewer than 50 grew on the key in 1991. Despite efforts to propagate the plant, there are now 16 Sargent's palms on Elliott Key, with about 123 propagated on Long Key. Two critically endangered butterflies, Schaus' swallowtail (Papilio aristodemus) and the Miami blue, are found in the park, mostly on Elliott Key. In 2012 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) authorized a capture and captive breeding program for Schaus' swallowtail after only five of the butterflies were found by surveyors in the park, down from 35 in 2011, of a total surveyed Florida population of 41. The Miami blue was feared to be extinct after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, but a population was found in 1999 at Bahia Honda Key. Captive breeding produced 25,000 Miami blues, some of which have been released on Elliott Key with mixed results. =Coral reef and offshore waters= Green sea turtle Beyond the keys in the Atlantic Ocean the seafloor slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef. The reef, composed of living corals, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations.NPCA, p. 15 Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half the area of the park, with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank-barrier reef.NPCA, p. 18 Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters. The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef on the edge of the Florida carbonate platform, the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys, and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys. The offshore reefs are dominated by elkhorn coral to water depth, and staghorn coral below 10 meters. The landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical brain coral. The island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and Porites finger corals.Harris, Tuttle, Tuttle, pp. 272‚Äì273 Reef environments in Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species richness and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006‚Äì2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract and the decline in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so coral- dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.Kellison et al., pp. 19‚Äì21 The park's eastern boundary lies just beyond the rise of the offshore reef at ten-fathom () sea depth. Areas farther offshore are protected within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which extends eastward to a boundary corresponding to a depth of . The offshore waters harbor brown pelicans, magnificent frigatebirds, brown boobies, particularly around the offshore lights, and pelagic birds such as shearwaters and petrels. Whales in offshore waters are rare, but can include right whales, humpback whales, sperm whales, fin whales and sei whales, all of them endangered. The smalltooth sawfish is similarly rare in park waters and endangered. Threatened coral species include elkhorn and staghorn corals, as well as pillar coral, listed as endangered in Florida. =Exotic species= Biscayne Bay's \\"Safety Valve\\" is a natural outlet for storm surges More than 50 species of exotic plant have been documented in the park, with almost 20 of those considered to be pest species which may displace native plants and possibly alter the ecological balance. Green iguanas, cane toads, black rats, lionfish, fire ants, oscars and brown basilisk lizards are common in the park. The lionfish (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) is a tropical fish from the Indian-Pacific Ocean area. It is known for its voracious appetite and its ability to establish itself in new waters, rapidly replacing other species. Researchers theorized the introduction of this species in the park occurred during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Sightings in Biscayne Bay at that time were believed to have been from home aquariums destroyed during the hurricane, though the researcher who first proposed the theory has since retracted the assertion. More recent lionfish sightings are probably from more established populations in the Florida Keys to the south of the park. Also likely originating from human captivity, Burmese pythons have been observed near the park's boundary along the mainland. Exotic plant species which pose the highest risk to native plant communities include Brazilian-pepper, torpedo grass, tuberous sword fern, guava and portiatree. Climate Biscayne's tropical climate reflects its location in extreme South Florida. Southern Miami-Dade County is classified as having a tropical savanna climate in the K√∂ppen-Geiger system, with the park bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. Seasons may be divided into the November‚ÄìApril dry season and the May‚ÄìOctober wet season. Dry season temperatures average between with an average monthly rainfall of . Wet season temperatures average between with an average monthly rainfall of . The wet season roughly coincides with hurricane season, with frequent thunderstorms. Like many locations in southern Florida, Biscayne National Park is affected by hurricanes every few years. Most storms require temporary closings and occasional repairs to park facilities. A direct hit by a powerful hurricane can produce severe consequences, primarily by its impact on human interventions in the environment rather than on the natural environment of the park, which is well-adapted to these events.Harris, Tuttle, Tuttle, p. 268 Significant hurricanes to strike Biscayne include storms in 1835 and 1904, the 1906 Florida Keys hurricane, the 1926 Miami hurricane, the 1929 Bahamas hurricane, the 1935 Labor Day hurricane,Shumaker, pp. 58‚Äì59 the 1935 Yankee hurricane, the 1941 Florida hurricane, the 1945 Southeast Florida hurricane, the 1948 Miami hurricane, Hurricane King in 1950, Hurricane Donna in 1960,. Hurricane Cleo in 1964, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The park can be affected by wave action from more distant tropical storms such as 2012's Hurricane Sandy, which damaged facilities on Elliott Key. Hurricane Andrew at landfall on Biscayne Bay On August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew came ashore just south of Miami, passing directly across Biscayne National Park with maximum sustained winds of , with gusts to . The storm surge was up to above mean sea level. It was a compact Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Biscayne Bay was affected by bottom scouring and turbidity and with damage to its fringes of mangrove forest. Leakage from damaged boats and marinas polluted the bay with fuel, with discharges continuing for nearly a month after the hurricane's passage. A commemorative plaque was placed at the Dante Fascell Visitor Center in 2002 to commemorate the human and environmental cost of Andrew, and to celebrate the area's recovery from the storm's effects. The inscription reads in part: > On Monday, August 24, 1992, at 4:30 a.m., the eye wall of Hurricane Andrew > passed over this point before striking Homestead and southern Miami-Dade > County. The Fowey Rocks light station transmitted weather data with winds peaking at a two-minute wind speed of and a gust to before the station ceased transmitting, presumably due to damage from stronger gusts. The strongest part of the eyewall had not reached Fowey Rocks when it stopped transmitting. Since all park lands are no more than a few feet above sea level, they are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Park Service studies project that much of the park's land area will be lost in the next two hundred years. Sea level in Biscayne Bay is projected to rise between by 2030, and by 2060. A sea level rise of is projected to increase saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne Aquifer. Higher rises will make the southern Everglades a saltwater marsh, altering the ecology of the region.

Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play Wood Painting. The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \\"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\". Here, the motif of silence refers to the \\"silence of God\\", which is a major theme of the film. The Seventh Seal is considered a classic of world cinema, as well as one of the greatest movies of all time. It established Bergman as a world-renowned director, containing scenes which have become iconic through homages, critical analysis, and parodies. Plot Disillusioned knight Antonius Block and his cynical squire J√∂ns return from the Crusades to find the country ravaged by the plague. The knight encounters Death, whom he challenges to a chess match, believing he can survive as long as the game continues. The game they start continues throughout the story. Death and Antonius Block choose sides for the chess game The knight and his squire pass a caravan of actors: Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son Mikael and actor-manager Jonas Skat. Waking early, Jof has a vision of Mary leading the infant Jesus, which he relates to a smilingly-disbelieving Mia. Block and J√∂ns visit a church where a fresco of the Danse Macabre is being painted, and the squire chides the artist for colluding in the ideological fervor that led to the crusade. In the confessional, Block tells the priest he wants to perform \\"one meaningful deed\\" after what he now sees as a pointless life. Upon revealing to him the chess strategy that will save his life, the knight discovers that it is actually Death with whom he has been speaking. Leaving the church, Block speaks to a young woman condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the devil. He believes she will tell him about life beyond death, only to find that she is insane. In a deserted village, J√∂ns saves a mute servant girl from being raped by Raval, a theologian who ten years earlier convinced the knight to join the Crusades and is now a thief. J√∂ns vows to destroy his face if they meet again. The servant girl accompanies J√∂ns into town, where the actors are performing. There, Skat is enticed away for a tryst by Lisa, wife of the blacksmith Plog. The stage show is interrupted by a procession of flagellants led by a preacher who harangues the townspeople. At the town's inn, Raval manipulates Plog and other customers into intimidating Jof. The bullying is broken up by J√∂ns who slashes Raval's face. The knight and squire are joined by Jof's family and a repentant Plog. Block enjoys a picnic of milk and strawberries that Mia has gathered and declares, \\"I'll carry this memory between my hands as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk... And it will be an adequate sign ‚Äî it will be enough for me.\\" Block now invites Plog and the actors to shelter from the plague in his castle. When they encounter Skat and Lisa in the forest, she returns to Plog, while Skat fakes a remorseful suicide. As the group moves on, Skat climbs a tree to spend the night, but Death appears beneath and cuts down the tree. Meeting the condemned woman being drawn to execution, Block asks her to summon Satan so he can question him about God. The girl claims she has done so, but the knight only sees her terror and gives her herbs to take away her pain as she is placed on the pyre. The final scene depicting the Danse Macabre They encounter Raval, stricken by the plague. J√∂ns stops the servant girl from uselessly bringing him water, and Raval dies alone. Jof tells his wife that he can see the knight playing chess with Death and decides to flee with his family, while Block knowingly keeps Death occupied. As Death states \\"No one escapes me\\", Block knocks the chess pieces over but Death restores them to their place. On the next move, Death wins the game and announces that when they meet again, it will be the last time for all. Death then asks Block if he achieved the \\"meaningful deed\\" he wished to accomplish and the knight replies that he has. Block is reunited with his wife and the party shares a final supper, interrupted by Death's arrival. The rest of the party then introduce themselves, and the mute servant girl greets him with \\"It is finished.\\" Jof and his family have sheltered in their caravan from a violent storm, which he interprets as the Angel of Death passing by. In the morning, Jof's second sight allows him to see the knight and his companions being led away over the hillside in a wild Dance of Death.

Its first public performance, which he directed, was on radio in 1954. He also directed it on stage in Malm√∂ the next spring, and in the autumn it was staged in Stockholm, directed by Bengt Ekerot, who would later play the character Death in the film version.Det sjunde inseglet ‚Äì Pressreaktion & Kommentar Svensk Filmografi (in Swedish). Swedish Film Institute. Retrieved on 17 August 2009. In his autobiography, The Magic Lantern, Bergman wrote that \\"Wood Painting gradually became The Seventh Seal, an uneven film which lies close to my heart, because it was made under difficult circumstances in a surge of vitality and delight.\\"Ingmar Bergman (1988). The Magic Lantern. Penguin Books. London. p. 274. The script for The Seventh Seal was commenced while Bergman was in the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm recovering from a stomach complaint. It was at first rejected and Bergman was given the go-ahead for the project from Carl-Anders Dymling at Svensk Filmindustri only after the success at Cannes of Smiles of a Summer Night. Bergman rewrote the script five times and was given a schedule of only thirty-five days and a budget of $150,000. It was to be the seventeenth film he had directed. All scenes except two were shot in or around the Filmstaden studios in Solna. The exceptions were the famous opening scene with Death and the Knight playing chess by the sea, and the ending with the dance of death, which were both shot at Hovs Hallar, a rocky, precipitous beach area in north- western Scania.Ingmar Bergman Face to Face ‚Äì Shooting the film The Seventh Seal In the Magic Lantern autobiography Bergman writes of the film's iconic penultimate shot: \\"The image of the Dance of Death beneath the dark cloud was achieved at hectic speed because most of the actors had finished for the day. Assistants, electricians, and a make-up man and about two summer visitors, who never knew what it was all about, had to dress up in the costumes of those condemned to death.

Portrait of the Middle Ages With regard to the relevancy of historical accuracy to a film that is heavily metaphorical and allegorical, John Aberth, writing in A Knight at the Movies, holds > the film only partially succeeds in conveying the period atmosphere and > thought world of the fourteenth century. Bergman would probably counter that > it was never his intention to make an historical or period film. As it was > written in a program note that accompanied the movie's premier \\"It is a > modern poem presented with medieval material that has been very freely > handled... The script in particular‚Äîembodies a mid-twentieth century > existentialist angst... Still, to be fair to Bergman, one must allow him his > artistic license, and the script's modernisms may be justified as giving the > movie's medieval theme a compelling and urgent contemporary relevance... Yet > the film succeeds to a large degree because it is set in the Middle Ages, a > time that can seem both very remote and very immediate to us living in the > modern world...

Death playing chess, from T√§by Church, fresco by Albertus Pictor Similarly defending it as an allegory, Aleksander Kwiatkowski in the book Swedish Film Classics, writes > The international response to the film which among other awards won the > jury's special prize at Cannes in 1957 reconfirmed the author's high rank > and proved that The Seventh Seal regardless of its degree of accuracy in > reproducing medieval scenery may be considered as a universal, timeless > allegory.Swedish Film Classics by Aleksander Kwiatkowski, Svenska > filminstitutet p. 93 Much of the film's imagery is derived from medieval art. For example, Bergman has stated that the image of a man playing chess with a skeletal Death was inspired by a medieval church painting from the 1480s in T√§by kyrka, T√§by, north of Stockholm, painted by Albertus Pictor.Stated in Marie Nyrer√∂d's interview series (the first part named Bergman och filmen) aired on Sveriges Television Easter 2004. However, the medieval Sweden portrayed in this movie includes creative anachronisms. The flagellant movement was foreign to Sweden, and large-scale witch persecutions only began in the 15th century.Said by Swedish historian Dick Harrison in an introduction to the movie on Sveriges Television, 2005. Reiterated in his book Gud vill det! Generally speaking, historians Johan Huizinga, Friedrich Heer and Barbara Tuchman have all argued that the late Middle Ages of the 14th century was a period of \\"doom and gloom\\" similar to what is reflected in this film, characterized by a feeling of pessimism, an increase in a penitential style of piety that was slightly masochistic, all aggravated by various disasters such as the Black Death, famine, the Hundred Years' War between France and England, and the Papal schism.Barbara Tuchman (1978). A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. This is sometimes called the crisis of the Late Middle Ages, and Tuchman regards the 14th century as \\"a distant mirror\\" of the 20th century in a way that echoes Bergman's sensibilities. Nonetheless, the main period of the Crusades is well before this era; they took place in a more optimistic period. Major themes The title refers to a passage about the end of the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \\"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\" (Revelation 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: \\"Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to?\\" Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block states: \\"Faith is a torment ‚Äì did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.\\" Melvyn Bragg notes that the concept of the \\"Silence of God\\" in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be- believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State Lutheran Church. In Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as A Painting on Wood, the figure of Death in a Dance of Death is represented not by an actor, but by silence, \\"mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void.\\"Martin Esslin. Mediations: Essays on Brecht, Beckett and the Media. Abacus. London. 1980. p. 181. Some of the powerful influences on the film were Picasso's picture of the two acrobats, Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, Strindberg's dramas Folkungasagan (\\"The Saga of the Folkung Kings\\") and The Road to Damascus, the frescoes at H√§rkeberga church and a painting by Albertus Pictor in T√§by church. Just prior to shooting, Bergman directed for radio the play Everyman by Hugo von Hofmannsthal. By this time he had also directed plays by Shakespeare, Strindberg, Camus, Chesterton, Anouilh, Tennessee Williams, Pirandello, Leh√°r, Moli√®re and Ostrovsky. The actors Bibi Andersson (with whom Bergman was in a relationship from 1955 to 1959) who played the juggler's wife Mia, and Max von Sydow, whose role as the knight was the first of many star parts he would bring to Bergman's films and whose rugged Nordic dignity became a vital resource within Bergman's \\"troupe\\" of key actors,H√∂√∂k, Marianne, Ingmar Bergman, Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand, Stockholm, 1962 p.115f both made a strong impact on the mood and style of the film. Bergman grew up in a home infused with an intense Christianity, his father being a charismatic rector (this may have explained Bergman's adolescent infatuation with Hitler, which later deeply tormented him). As a six-year-old child, Bergman used to help the gardener carry corpses from the Royal Hospital Sophiahemmet (where his father was chaplain) to the mortuary. When as a boy he saw the film Black Beauty, the fire scene excited him so much he stayed in bed for three days with a temperature. Despite living a Bohemian lifestyle in partial rebellion against his upbringing, Bergman often signed his scripts with the initials \\"S.D.G\\" (Soli Deo Gloria) ‚Äî \\"To God Alone the Glory\\" ‚Äî just as J. S. Bach did at the end of every musical composition. Gerald Mast writes: > \\"Like the gravedigger in Hamlet, the Squire [...] treats death as a bitter > and hopeless joke. Since we all play chess with death, and since we all must > suffer through that hopeless joke, the only question about the game is how > long it will last and how well we will play it. To play it well, to live, is > to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the Church urges in > Bergman's metaphor.\\"Gerald Mast A Short History of the Movies. p. 405. Melvyn Bragg writes: > \\"[I]t is constructed like an argument. It is a story told as a sermon might > be delivered: an allegory...each scene is at once so simple and so charged > and layered that it catches us again and again...Somehow all of Bergman's > own past, that of his father, that of his reading and doing and seeing, that > of his Swedish culture, of his political burning and religious melancholy, > poured into a series of pictures which carry that swell of contributions and > contradictions so effortlessly that you could tell the story to a child, > publish it as a storybook of photographs and yet know that the deepest > questions of religion and the most mysterious revelation of simply being > alive are both addressed.\\" The Jesuit publication America identifies it as having begun \\"a series of seven films that explored the possibility of faith in a post-Holocaust, nuclear age\\". Likewise, film historians Thomas W. Bohn and Richard L. Stromgren identify this film as beginning \\"his cycle of films dealing with the conundrum of religious faith\\". Reception Upon its original Swedish release, The Seventh Seal was met with a somewhat divided critical response; its cinematography was widely praised, while \\"Bergman the scriptwriter [was] lambasted.\\" Swedish journalist and critic Nils Beyer, writing for Morgon- tidningen, compared it to Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc and Day of Wrath. While finding Dreyer's films to be superior, he still noted that \\"it isn't just any director that you feel like comparing to the old Danish master.\\" He also praised the usage of the cast, in particular Max von Sydow, whose character he described as \\"a pale, serious Don Quixote character with a face as if sculpted in wood\\", and \\"Bibi Andersson, who appears as if painted in faded watercolours but still can emit small delicious glimpses of female warmth.\\" Hanserik Hjert√©n for Arbetaren started his review by praising the cinematography, but soon went on to describe the film as \\"a horror film for children\\" and said that beyond the superficial, it is mostly reminiscent of Bergman's \\"sophomoric films from the 40s.\\" Bergman's international reputation, on the other hand, was largely cemented by The Seventh Seal. Bosley Crowther had only positive things to say in his 1958 review for The New York Times, and praised how the themes were elevated by the cinematography and performances: \\"the profundities of the ideas are lightened and made flexible by glowing pictorial presentation of action that is interesting and strong. Mr. Bergman uses his camera and actors for sharp, realistic effects.\\" The film is now regarded as a masterpiece of cinema. Empire magazine, in 2010, ranked it the eighth-greatest film of world cinema. In a poll held by the same magazine, it was voted 335th 'Greatest Movie of All Time' from a list of 500. In addition, on the 100th anniversary of cinema in 1995, the Vatican included The Seventh Seal in its list of its 45 \\"great films\\" for its thematic values. The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 30th Academy Awards, but was not nominated. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Narratively bold and visually striking, The Seventh Seal brought Ingmar Bergman to the world stage ‚Äì and remains every bit as compelling today\\". Influence The Seventh Seal significantly helped Bergman in gaining his position as a world-class director. When the film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, the attention generated by it (along with the previous year's Smiles of a Summer Night) made Bergman and his stars Max von Sydow and Bibi Andersson well known to the European film community, and the critics and readers of Cahiers du Cin√©ma, among others, discovered him with this movie. Within five years of this, he had established himself as the first real auteur of Swedish cinema. With its images and reflections upon death and the meaning of life, The Seventh Seal had a symbolism that was \\"immediately apprehensible to people trained in literary culture who were just beginning to discover the 'art' of film, and it quickly became a staple of high school and college literature courses... Unlike Hollywood 'movies,' The Seventh Seal clearly was aware of elite artistic culture and thus was readily appreciated by intellectual audiences.\\" = Film and television = Bengt Ekerot as Death The representation of Death as a white-faced man who wears a dark cape and plays chess with mortals has been a popular object of parody in other films and television. Several films and comedy sketches portray Death as playing games other than or in addition to chess. In the final scene of the 1968 film De D√ºva (mock Swedish for \\"The Dove\\"), a 15-minute pastiche of Bergman's work generally and his Wild Strawberries in particular, the protagonist plays badminton against Death, and wins when the droppings of a passing dove strike Death in the eye. The photography imitates throughout the style of Bergman's cinematographers Sven Nykvist and Gunnar Fischer.Remembering De D√ºva (The Dove), a 30 July 2007 Slate article = Popular music = The film is referenced in several songs. The plot is recapitulated in Scott Walker's \\"The Seventh Seal\\" from his album Scott 4.Genius.com There is a passing reference in Bruce Cockburn's song \\"How I Spent My Fall Vacation\\", from his album Humans, in which the song's narrative is bracketed by two young men watching the film in a cinema. On Iron Maiden's album Dance of Death (2003), the title track was inspired by the final scene of The Seventh Seal where, according to guitarist Janick Gers, \\"these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death.\\" =Opera= In 2016, composer Jo√£o MacDowell premiered in New York City at Scandinavia House the music for the first act of The Seventh Seal, a work in progress under contract with the Ingmar Bergman Foundation, sung in Swedish. The work was under production by the International Brazilian Opera (IBOC) as part of the celebrations for the Ingmar Bergman centenary in 2018. The posters for the opera with photography by Athena Azevedo and design by Toshiaki Ide and Hisa Ide, featuring dancer Eliana Carneiro, in a collaboration work by the International Brazilian Opera (IBOC) and IF Studio LLC, have won multiple prizes in the Graphis Inc. International Competition, including double Platinum in the Poster and Design categories.

He has been a member of several notable bands, in addition to his own work as a songwriter for other artists. Alexakis founded several record labels throughout his career, and worked as an A&R; representative for major record labels between and during his own musical projects. Later he became a political activist, and lobbied for special concerns which included drug awareness policies, and support of the families of the military. Early life Alexakis was born in Los Angeles, California, the youngest of five children. Soon after his father left the family when Art was five years old, financial difficulties forced his mother to relocate the family to the Mar Vista Gardens housing project in California, located on the Westside of Los Angeles in Del Rey. Alexakis was physically and sexually abused by older kids in his neighborhood.Carlson, Daniel. \\"SXSW Film Festival: The Other F-Word\\" His brother George died of a heroin overdose when Alexakis was 12. That same year, Alexakis's 15-year-old girlfriend committed suicide.Everclear‚Äôs Art Alexakis: ‚ÄùSparkle and Fade‚Äô Was My Escape Route‚Äô Not long after her death, Alexakis attempted suicide by filling his pockets with sand and lead weights and jumping off the Santa Monica Pier. Later, he said that the vision and voice of his brother George compelled him to survive.Edwards, Gavin. \\"Clear Unpleasant Danger\\". Details. May 1996. Alexakis started shooting up when he was 13, mostly taking crystal methamphetamine. He became addicted to heroin and cocaine, and he survived a cocaine overdose when he was 22. He quit drugs cold turkey in June, 1984. Music career =Early bands= While living in Los Angeles in the '80s, Alexakis was in a band called Shakin' Brave. Shakin' Brave featured a rather rough rock sound, but never really rose above the sea of music in Southern California. Alexakis and his first wife Anita relocated to San Francisco. While living in San Francisco, Alexakis stumbled upon a genre of music known as \\"cowpunk\\", a style merging two prevalent forms of music with which he grew up ‚Äî the tunefulness of country and the distorted guitars/fast tempo of rock and roll. Inspired, Alexakis established Shindig Records. The Easy Hoes formed in the late '80s and released one album, Tragic Songs of Life, in 1989. Alexakis's next project began as a solo album but grew into a group project under the name Colorfinger. This band released the album, Deep in the Heart of the Beast in the Sun as well as an EP, Demonstration. Only the full-length album was made available for sale. Both were released on Alexakis's Shindig Records. A few songs originally performed by Colorfinger were made into Everclear songs, such as \\"Why I Don't Believe in God\\", \\"Invisible,\\" \\"The Twistinside\\", \\"Heartspark Dollarsign\\", and \\"Hateful\\". =Everclear= Alexakis singing with Everclear at Woodstock '99. Following a move to Portland, Alexakis placed an ad in The Rocket seeking a bass player and a drummer to form a new band. Alexakis had two respondents, Craig Montoya and Scott Cuthbert. The trio became the first incarnation of Everclear. After Cuthbert was replaced by Greg Eklund, the band spent the better part of a decade as a dominant act on alternative rock radio. The band scored three platinum albums in Sparkle & Fade, So Much for the Afterglow, and Songs from an American Movie Vol. One: Learning How to Smile. The instability and personal turmoil Alexakis experienced throughout his life would directly inspire his lyrics. \\"Father of Mine\\" and \\"Why I Don't Believe in God\\" described his difficult youth, while \\"Heroin Girl\\", \\"Strawberry\\", and \\"Color Pit\\" touched upon his drug addictions. Everclear's breakthrough album, Sparkle & Fade, deals with the themes of escape and redemption that pervaded his life upon leaving San Francisco. =Songwriting and industry roles= While finding success as a musical act and songwriter, Alexakis took on other projects within the music industry. For several years, he served as an A&R; representative for Capitol Records. In 1996, he produced Frogpond's 1996 album Count to Ten. In the early 2000s, Alexakis established his own label, Popularity Recordings, as a subsidiary of Artemis Records. Alexakis produced the label's first release, the 2002 album Volume by Flipp. The label closed in 2003. Alexakis has also dabbled in songwriting with other artists, including co-writing and dueting the song \\"At the End of the Day\\" released on Marion Raven's 2005 and 2007 albums, Here I Am and Set Me Free, respectively. In October 2008, Alexakis entered the studio with the Minneapolis-based band Apparently Nothing (previously a Madison band and later renamed to The Usual Things) to produce their debut album, tentatively titled The Middle Coast. Radio From March 2017 through February 2019, Alexakis hosted a weekly radio show on Sirius XM's 1990s alternative and grunge music channel, Lithium (Channel 34). Film and television Alexakis took film classes at Los Angeles Community College. In 2000, Alexakis made brief appearances in the Heather Graham comedy Committed. He played the lead role in the 2006 short film Room to Breathe and had parts in Rid of Me (2011) and Rogue River (2012). In 2014, he had a role as a tattoo artist in the biographical drama film Wild starring Reese Witherspoon. Alexakis was interviewed on Space Ghost Coast to Coast; the interview never aired, although it is briefly glimpsed on Episode 60, \\"Lawsuit.\\" In 2002, Alexakis appeared in two episodes of The Chris Isaak Show. In 2006, Alexakis appeared on an episode of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide on Nickelodeon as a music teacher named Mr. Gibson (a reference to Gibson guitars). In August 2006, Alexakis appeared on The O'Reilly Factor discussing the music video for \\"Hater\\", the first single from Everclear's Welcome to the Drama Club. Political activism In 2000, Alexakis testified before Congress in support of HR 1488, the Compassion for Children and Child Support Enforcement Act. Through ACES, the Association of Children for the Enforcement of Support, President Geraldine Jenson and Nancy Pelosi sponsored this bill. The law passed. Alexakis was a delegate for the 2004 Democratic National Convention representing Oregon's 3rd congressional district after campaigning for John Edwards during the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries. He and Everclear recorded the Woody Guthrie standard \\"This Land Is Your Land\\", which he performed at several political events. He has also been involved in drug awareness programs, including the taping of public service announcements for the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Along with Everclear, he has performed for U.S. soldiers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Hawaii, and Abu Dhabi. He has also performed for Snowball Express, which organizes events for military families who lost loved ones in the war. Personal life During his younger years, Alexakis was an atheist. In an August 2000 interview with Spin, Alexakis stated he had since become Christian. Speaking about his then-fianc√©e Stephanie Greig, he said, \\"She's a Christian, and I'm a Christian‚Äîmy ex isn't‚Äîand so I was like, it's okay to be a Christian. I'm not like a born- again... Well, I guess I am born-again, in a way. But I don't knock people over the head with it. I just kind of use my spirituality to make my life better.\\" Alexakis is also a gay rights activist. In 2010, he expressed his support for gay marriage and opposition to Proposition 8, \\"I don't think Prop 8, gay marriage or the things your community lobbies for are political issues. We are Americans; that's where it ends. If Lady Justice is supposed to be blind, then why not towards your community? It is going to happen; it's happening, and I think it is a great thing.\\" In the same interview, he reflected on the gay rights movement in the 1970s by saying, \\"I went to San Francisco to see the Sex Pistols in 1978. I was barely 16 and I went with this neighbor of mine, who my mom didn't know was gay, but I knew was gay. I went to Castro with a whole group of gay guys and saw a side of the culture that I had never seen before. I was aware of Harvey Milk before most people were. It was a great experience.\\" On March 26, 2019, Alexakis announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in a letter to fans posted on the band's website. Alexakis says he was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS following a car accident three years prior.

Cedar Breaks is a natural amphitheater, stretching across , with a depth of over . The elevation of the rim of the amphitheater is over above sea level. The rock of the amphitheater is more eroded than, but otherwise similar to, formations at nearby Bryce Canyon National Park, Red Canyon in Dixie National Forest, and select areas of Cedar Mountain (SR-14). Because of its elevation, snow often makes parts of the park inaccessible to vehicles from October through May. Its rim visitor center is open from June through October. Several hundred thousand people visit the monument annually. The monument area is the headwaters of Mammoth Creek, a tributary of the Sevier River.  Flora and fauna  Wildlife can often be seen in this high altitude setting. Mule deer and porcupines are common, as are rodents and similar animals such as marmots, golden-mantled ground squirrels, pocket gophers, and chipmunks. Mountain lions and other larger animals live in the area but are seldom seen. Common birds include the Clark's nutcracker, violet-green swallows, and the common raven. Larkspur wildflower near the rim of Cedar Breaks. The bristlecone pine, a species of tree that is known as the longest living single organism, can also be found in the high country, with some local specimens known to be more than 1600 years old. Subalpine meadows dot the canyon rim in such areas as Alpine Pond, which is an easy hike from the road along a clear trail. Aspen, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir trees, and limber pine also grow here. Spring begins in June at this elevation, when wildflowers cover the canyon rim. Wildflowers bloom all during the short growing season, and visitors can enjoy Colorado columbine, scarlet paintbrush, subalpine larkspur, pretty shooting star, orange sneezeweed, Panguitch buckwheat, prairie smoke, silvery lupin, yellow evening primrose, shrubby cinquefoil, Parry primrose, plantainleaf buttercup, and two species of Penstemon.  History and geology  Hoodoos in Cedar Breaks The amphitheater, located near the west end of the Colorado Plateau, covers the west side of the Markagunt Plateau, the same plateau that forms parts of Zion National Park. Uplift and erosion formed the canyon over millions of years, raising and then wearing away the shale, limestone, and sandstone that were deposited at the bottom of an ancient lake, known as Lake Claron, about 60 million years ago. It continues to erode at a pace of about every 5 years. Atop the plateau, much of the area is covered by volcanic rock known as rhyolitic tuff, formed during cataclysmic eruptions around 28 million years ago. The rocks of the eroded canyon contain iron and manganese in various combinations, providing brilliant colors that led Indians to call it the Circle of Painted Cliffs. Iron oxides provide the reds, oranges and yellows, while manganese oxides provide shades of purple. The color of the rock is soft and subtle compared to the hoodoos at Bryce Canyon. The area is a form of badlands--canyons, spires, walls, and cliffs so steep and confusing that the land, while of great aesthetic value, is of little utilitarian worth. Early settlers called them badlands or breaks and created the current name by combining breaks with cedar for the many juniper trees (often incorrectly called cedars) that grow in the area. Cedar Breaks National Monument was established in 1933. A small lodge designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood and built and operated by the Utah Parks Company once existed near the south end of the monument, but it was razed in 1972. The Cedar Breaks Lodge was the smallest of the park lodges in the Southwest. It was deemed \\"uneconomical to operate\\" by the Park Service, but protests associated with its demolition caused the Park Service to re-examine its policies concerning lodges in other parks, contributing to their preservation. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification, the area has a dry-summer subalpine climate (Dsc).  Attractions  There are two well-advertised hiking trails in the monument, and a campsite near the canyon rim.  National park proposal  In 2006, Iron County officials considered a proposal for legislation to expand the monument and rename it Cedar Breaks National Park. The new park would include the adjacent Ashdown Gorge Wilderness, some private land and nearby Flanigan Arch.

The standard molar entropy is usually given the symbol , and has units of joules per mole kelvin (J‚ãÖmol‚àí1‚ãÖK‚àí1). Unlike standard enthalpies of formation, the value of is absolute. That is, an element in its standard state has a definite, nonzero value of at room temperature. The entropy of a pure crystalline structure can be 0J‚ãÖmol‚àí1‚ãÖK‚àí1 only at 0K, according to the third law of thermodynamics. However, this assumes that the material forms a 'perfect crystal' without frozen in entropy (crystallographic defects, dislocations), which is never completely true because crystals always grow at a finite temperature. However, this residual entropy is often quite negligible. Thermodynamics If a mole of substance were at 0K, then warmed by its surroundings to 298K, its total molar entropy would be the addition of all individual contributions: :S^\\\\circ = \\\\sum_{k=1}^N \\\\Delta S_k =\\\\int _{T_1\\\\approx0} ^{T_2} \\\\frac{dS}{dT} dT=\\\\sum_{k=1}^N \\\\frac{dQ_k}{T} = \\\\int _{T_1\\\\approx0} ^{T_2} \\\\frac {C_{p_k}}{T} dT In this example, T_2 =298 K and C_{p_k} is the specific heat at a constant pressure of the substance in the reversible process . The specific heat is not constant during the experiment because it changes depending on the temperature of the substance (which is increasing to 298K in this case). Therefore, a table of values for \\\\frac{C_{p_k}}{T} is required to find the total molar entropy. \\\\frac{dQ_{k}}{T} represents a very small exchange of heat energy at temperature . The total molar entropy is the sum of many small changes in molar entropy, where each small change can be considered a reversible process. Chemistry The standard molar entropy of a gas at STP includes contributions from: * The heat capacity of one mole of the solid from 0K to the melting point (including heat absorbed in any changes between different crystal structures). * The latent heat of fusion of the solid. * The heat capacity of the liquid from the melting point to the boiling point. * The latent heat of vaporization of the liquid. * The heat capacity of the gas from the boiling point to room temperature. Changes in entropy are associated with phase transitions and chemical reactions. Chemical equations make use of the standard molar entropy of reactants and products to find the standard entropy of reaction: :{\\\\Delta S^\\\\circ}_{rxn} = S^\\\\circ_{products} - S^\\\\circ_{reactants} The standard entropy of reaction helps determine whether the reaction will take place spontaneously. According to the second law of thermodynamics, a spontaneous reaction always results in an increase in total entropy of the system and its surroundings: :(\\\\Delta S_{total} = \\\\Delta S_{system} + \\\\Delta S_{surroundings})>0 Molar entropy is not same for all gases. Under identical conditions, it is greater for a heavier gas.

At the time, it was the largest corporate merger in U.S. history.. American Motors's most-similar competitors were those automakers who held similar annual sales such as Studebaker, Packard, Kaiser and Willys-Overland. American Motors's largest competitors were the Big Three--Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. American Motors's production line included small cars: the Rambler American which began as the Nash Rambler in 1950, Hornet, Gremlin and Pacer; intermediate and full-size cars, including the Ambassador, Rebel, and Matador; muscle cars including the Marlin, AMX and Javelin; and early four-wheel-drive variants of the Eagle, the first true crossover in the U.S. market. Regarded as \\"a small company deft enough to exploit special market segments left untended by the giants\\", American Motors was widely known for the design work of chief stylist Dick Teague, who \\"had to make do with a much tighter budget than his counterparts at Detroit's Big Three\\" but \\"had a knack for making the most of his employer's investment\\". After periods of intermittent but unsustained success, Renault acquired a major interest in American Motors in 1979, and the company was ultimately acquired by Chrysler. Overview 1954 - George W. Mason The 1954 merger of Nash-Kelvinator Corporation and Hudson Motor Car Company, and the creation of American Motors, was led by Nash- Kelvinator president George W. Mason to reap benefits from the strengths of the two firms to battle the much larger \\"Big Three\\" automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). The merger was intended to be the first step of amalgamating the Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, and Packard marques into a single company. The plan was for Nash to acquire Hudson and for Packard to acquire Studebaker, then merge the four marques into one. Mason had first discussed the possibility of a merger with Packard president James J. Nance in the late 1940s. Packard acquired Studebaker two months after Nash acquired Hudson. Mason became CEO and president of the new company and Hudson president A.E. Barit retired to become an American Motors board member. Mason selected long- time Nash associate and future governor of Michigan, George W. Romney as vice president. Roy Abernethy, ex Vice president of Sales for Willys, was hired to be Vice president of Sales for American Motors. 1954‚Äì1962 - George W. Romney Following Mason's sudden death on October 8, 1954, Romney took over, reorganizing the company and focusing American Motors's future on a new small car line. Mason's death also allowed Romney to put an end to any further discussions for a merger between American Motors and Studebaker-Packard. By the end of 1957, the legacy Nash and Hudson brands were completely phased out, replaced with the Rambler and Metropolitan brands. The company struggled at first, but under Abernethy, Rambler sales took off. A Rambler won the 1959 Mobil Economy Run and by 1960, was the third most popular brand of automobile in the United States, behind Ford and Chevrolet. 1962‚Äì1967 - Roy Abernethy George Romney left American Motors in 1962 to run for governor in Michigan and was replaced as CEO by Roy Abernethy. After two model years (1963 and 1964) of only producing compact cars, Abernethy shifted the focus of American Motors back to larger and more profitable cars like the Ambassador line from the perceived negative of the Rambler's economy car image. Ambassador sales jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965. In 1966 they went to more than 71,000. However, the huge costs of developing the new cars and engines meant American Motors now had problems in securing working capital to keep the company going. American Motors sales dropped twenty percent in the first half of 1966, and the firm reported a fiscal six-month loss of $4.2 million on sales of $479 million. Consequently, Robert B. Evans invested more than US$2 million because American Motors's stock was selling for only 60 percent of the company's net worth; thus he became its largest stockholder and was named its chairman on June 6, 1966, replacing Richard E. Cross, who continued as a director and chairman of the executive committee. The last quarter sales for American Motors ended September 30, 1966. American Motors recorded a loss of $12,648,000 for the year before Tax Credits and deferred Tax Assets. In the face of deteriorating financial and market positions, Abernethy was \\"retired\\" as CEO in 1967 and Evans \\"resigned\\" as chairman. 1967‚Äì1977 - Roy D. Chapin, Jr. Abernethy was replaced by the son of Hudson co-founder Roy D. Chapin, Roy D. Chapin, Jr. and Evans was replaced by William V. Luneberg. American Motors's public explanation for the removals was that the two had \\"stepped aside according to a plan to give a younger team an opportunity to move the company forward\\". Chapin took charge to revitalize the company, and designer Dick Teague economized by developing several vehicles from common stampings. While prices and costs were cut, new and more sporty automobiles were introduced, and from 1968 American Motors became known for the Javelin and AMX muscle cars. American Motors purchased Kaiser's Jeep utility vehicle operations in 1970 to complement its existing passenger car business. Beginning in the early 1970s, the company moved towards all-new compact car designs based on the Hornet, including the Hornet itself and the Gremlin. Other new models in the 1970s included the Matador and Pacer. 1977‚Äì1982 - Gerald C. Meyers A major management transition at American Motors stated on May 24, 1977, then Meyers was named president and Chief Operating Officer, succeeding the retiring William Luneburg. Upon the retirement of Chapin on October 21, 1977, Gerald C. Meyers, former president and Chief Operating Officer, became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. At the time, Meyers was 49 years old and became the youngest top executive in the automobile industry bringing a wealth of manufacturing experience. \\"The company was looking for a lot more than a steady hand on the tiller ‚Äî it was looking for a savior\\" but Meyers disagreed and argued that the company could survive and remain a factor in the automobile industry by abandoning its policy of head-on competition and instead focusing on and revamping its four-wheel-drive vehicles, a market segment left untended by the large automakers, and by acquiring advanced technology. Sagging sales and tight finances resulted in the elimination of the Matador line in the 1979 model year and the Pacer line in 1980, leaving American Motors to focus almost exclusively on its Hornet platform-based cars and the Jeep line. Hornet derivatives of the late 1970s included the Spirit and Concord, while the innovative 4-wheel-drive AMC Eagle introduced in 1979 was one of the first true crossovers. From 1980, American Motors partnered with France's Renault to help finance their manufacturing operations, obtain much-needed capital, and source subcompact vehicles. 1982‚Äì1984 - W. Paul Tippett, Jr. At age 53, Meyers retired from the company in February 1982, by which time Renault controlled 46 percent of American Motors. He was with the automaker 20 years and was noted for orchestrating \\"the complicated linkup between American Motors and Renault starting in 1979.\\" Meyers was succeeded as chairman by former American Motors President W. Paul Tippett Jr. At the time, Tippett was a member of American Motors management for only three years. Jose J. Dedeurwaerder, a Renault manager, became the new president of American Motors. After the 1983 model year, the Ameican Motors brand focused entirely on AWD autos; the company stopped producing two-wheel drive cars. American Motors facilities were used to produce the Renault-branded Alliance and Encore compact and subcompact cars. In September 1984 Paul Tippet left American Motors as CEO and was replaced by Jose J. Dedeurwaerder.AMC\`S TIPPETT TO HEAD HOME-FURNISHINGS FIRM  Date: June 28, 1985  Author: James Mateja  URL: https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-06-28-8502110570-story.html (Chicago Tribune)RENAULT OFFICER NAMED A.M.C.

Dedeurwaerder In 1985 Chrysler entered an agreement with American Motors to produce Dodge Diplomats and Plymouth Furys as well as Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons in American Motors's Kenosha, Wisconsin, plant. At the time, American Motors had excess manufacturing capacity, thus contract manufacturing for Chrysler made sense. 1986‚Äì1987 - Joe Cappy In 1987, after further new vehicle development that included the Medallion (a re-badged Renault 21) and Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign new full-size front-drive sedan that became the Eagle Premier, Renault sold its 47% ownership stake in American Motors to Chrysler. Chrysler made a public offer to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares of American Motors stock on the NYSE. American Motors was acquired by Chrysler Corporation in August 1987. The primary task of Chrysler management was to integrate the two companies into one as quickly as possible. American Motors's final CEO, Joe Cappy was tasked with achieving this by Chrysler president Gerald Greenwald as highest priority.'A merger of equals? Someone has to be in charge', Author: Joe Cappy, Date: June 10, 2019, URL: https://www.autonews.com/commentary/merger-equals-someone-has-be-charge (Automotive News magazine) Renault left the US market completely as a brand in 1987 and thus the Renault Medallion was sold through the newly formed Jeep- Eagle division of Chrysler as an Eagle, not a Renault. The Jeep-Eagle division was formed from the American Motors Jeep Renault dealer network. The Jeep and Eagle vehicles were marketed primarily by former American Motors dealers. American Motors's badge would be last used on the Eagle Sports Wagon through the 1988 model year, then be eliminated entirely. The Eagle car brand was phased out by 1998.  1954 creation  In January 1954, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation began acquisition of the Hudson Motor Car Company (in what was called a merger). The new corporation would be called the American Motors Corporation. (An earlier corporation with the same name, co-founded by Louis Chevrolet, had existed in New Jersey from 1916 through 1922 before merging into the Bessemer‚ÄìAmerican Motors Corporation.) The Nash-Kelvinator/Hudson deal was a straight stock transfer (three shares of Hudson listed at 11‚Öõ, for two shares of American Motors and one share of Nash-Kelvinator listed at 17‚Öú, for one share of American Motors) and finalized in the spring of 1954, forming the fourth-biggest auto company in the U.S. with assets of US$355 million and more than $100 million in working capital. The new company retained Hudson CEO A.E. Barit as a consultant and he took a seat on the Board of Directors. Nash's George W. Mason became president and CEO. American Motors dealership sign Mason, the architect of the merger, believed that the survival of the U.S' remaining independent automakers was dependent on their joining in one multibrand company capable of challenging the \\"Big Three\\"‚ÄîGeneral Motors, Ford, and Chrysler‚Äîas an equal. The \\"frantic 1953‚Äì54 Ford/GM price war\\" had a devastating impact on the remaining \\"independent\\" automakers. The reasons for the merger between Nash and Hudson included helping cut costs and strengthen their sales organizations to meet the intense competition expected from autos' Big Three. One quick result from the merger was the doubling up with Nash on purchasing and production, allowing Hudson to cut prices an average of $155 on the Wasp line, up to $204 on the more expensive Hornet models. After the merger, AMC had its first profitable quarter during the second three months of 1955, earning $1,592,307, compared to a loss of $3,848,667 during the same period in the previous year. Mason also entered into informal discussions with James J. Nance of Packard to outline his strategic vision. Interim plans were made for American Motors to buy Packard Ultramatic automatic transmissions and Packard V8 engines for certain American Motors products. In July 1954, Packard acquired Studebaker. The new Studebaker-Packard Corporation (S-P) made the new Packard V8 engine and Packard's Ultramatic automatic transmission available to American Motors for its 1955 Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models. When Mason died in 1954, George W. Romney succeeded him. Ironically, Romney had once been offered Nance's job. In 1948, Romney received offers from Packard for the post of chief operating officer and from Nash for the number two position in the company. Although the Packard offer would have paid more, Romney decided to work under Mason because he thought Nash had a brighter future. Studebaker-Packard President James Nance refused to consider merging with American Motors unless he could take the top position (Mason and Nance were former competitors as heads of the Kelvinator and Hotpoint, respectively), and a week after Mason's death Romney announced, \\"there are no mergers under way either directly or indirectly.\\" Romney agreed with Mason's commitment to buy S-P products. Mason and Nance had agreed that in return S-P would endeavor to purchase parts from American Motors, but S-P did not do so. As the Packard engines and transmissions were comparatively expensive, American Motors began development of its own V8. American Motors also spent US$40 million developing its Double Safe Single Unit monocoque, which debuted in the 1956 model year. In mid-1956, the Packard V8 and TwinUltramatic transmission were phased out and replaced by American Motors's new V8 and by GM Hydra-Matic and Borg-Warner transmissions.  Product development in the 1950s  Nash Metropolitan 1959 Rambler American Club Sedan 1958 Rambler Custom 4-Door Sedan = Product consolidation = American Motors combined the Nash and Hudson product lines under a common manufacturing strategy in 1955, with the production of Nashes and Hudsons consolidated at the Nash plant in Kenosha. The Detroit Hudson plant was converted to military contract production and eventually sold. The separate Nash and Hudson dealer networks were retained. The Hudsons were redesigned to bring them in harmony with Nash body styles. The fast-selling Rambler model was sold as both a Nash and a Hudson in 1955 and 1956. These badge-engineered Ramblers, along with similar Metropolitans, were identical save for hubcaps, nameplates, and other minor trim details. The pre-existing full-size Nash product line was continued and the Nash Statesman and Ambassador were restyled as the \\"new\\" Hudson Wasp and Hudson Hornet. Although the cars shared the same body shell, they were at least as different from one another as Chevrolet and Pontiac. Hudsons and Nashes each used their own engines as they had previously: the Hudson Hornet continued to offer the I6 that had powered the (NASCAR) champion during the early 1950s; the Wasp now used the former engine of the Hudson Jet. The Nash Ambassador and Statesman continued with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body panels, rear window glass, dash panels and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy owing to the lighter unitized Nash body. For the 1958 model year, the Nash and Hudson brands were dropped. Rambler became a marque in its own right and the mainstay of the company. The popular British-built Metropolitan subcompact continued as a standalone brand until it was discontinued in 1961. The prototype 1958 Nash Ambassador / Hudson Hornet, built on a stretched Rambler platform, was renamed at the last minute as \\"Ambassador by Rambler\\". To round out the model line American Motors reintroduced the old 1955, wheelbase Nash Rambler as the new Rambler American with only a few modifications. This gave Rambler a compact lineup with American, Rambler Six and Rebel V8, as well as the Ambassador wheelbase vehicles. = The \\"dinosaur-fighter\\" = Sales of Ramblers soared in the late 1950s in part because of American Motors' focus on the compact car and its marketing efforts. These included sponsoring the hugely popular Walt Disney anthology television series and as an exhibitor at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. George Romney himself pitched the Rambler product in the television commercials. While the \\"Big Three\\" introduced ever-larger cars, American Motors followed a \\"dinosaur- fighter\\" strategy. George W. Romney's leadership focused the company on the compact car, a fuel-efficient vehicle 20 years before there was a real need for them. This gave Romney a high profile in the media. Two core strategic factors came into play: (1) the use of shared components in American Motors products and (2) a refusal to participate in the Big Three's restyling race. This cost-control policy helped Rambler develop a reputation as solid economy cars. Company officials were confident in the changing market and in 1959 announced a $10 million (US$ in 2016 dollars) expansion of its Kenosha complex (to increase annual straight-time capacity from 300,000 to 440,000 cars). A letter to shareholders in 1959 claimed that the introduction of new compact cars by American Motors's large domestic competitors (for the 1960 model year) \\"signals the end of big-car domination in the U.S.\\" and that American Motors predicts small-car sales in the U.S. may reach 3 million units by 1963. American Motors was also beginning to experiment in non-gasoline powered automobiles. On April 1, 1959, American Motors and Sonotone Corporation announced a joint research effort to consider producing an electric car that was to be powered by a \\"self-charging\\" battery. Sonotone had the technology for making sintered plate nickel‚Äìcadmium batteries that can be recharged very rapidly and are lighter than a typical automobile lead‚Äìacid battery. In 1959, American Motors hired designer Dick Teague, who had previously worked for General Motors, Packard, and Chrysler; after Edmund E. Anderson left the company in 1961, Teague was named principal designer and in 1964, Vice President.  Changing focus in the 1960s  = Innovation = 1964 Rambler American 440-H 1964 Rambler Classic 770 1965 Rambler Marlin 1967 Ambassador 990 1969 American Motors AMX In an effort to stay competitive, American Motors produced a wide range of products during the 1960s and added innovations long before the \\"Big Three\\" introduced them. For example, the Rambler Classic was equipped with a standard tandem master cylinder in 1962 that provided stopping ability even if there was a failure in the brake system. Only Cadillac also included this safety feature six years before U.S. safety regulations required it on all cars. Rambler also was an early pioneer in offering an automatic shift indicator sequence (P R N D2 D1 L, where if one selected \\"D2\\", the car started in second gear, while \\"1\\" started in first gear) on its \\"Flash-O- Matic\\" transmission which is similar to today's \\"PRNDSL\\" shift pattern, made mandatory for the 1968 model year cars, which required a neutral position between reverse and drive, while General Motors still offered a shift selector that had reverse immediately next to low gear (PNDSLR) well into the 1960s. Unique in the domestic automotive industry, American Motors offered adjustable front seat backrests from their Nash-origin, and in 1964, the Classic and Ambassador were equipped with standard dual reclining front seats nearly a decade before the Big Three offered them as options. Bendix disc brakes were made standard on the Marlin and optional on other models in 1965. This made the Marlin one the first modern American cars with standard disc brakes, while the Big Three did not offer them until the early 1970s on most of their models to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. In the early part of the decade, sales were strong, thanks in no small part to the company's history of building small cars, which came into vogue in 1961. In both 1960 and 1961, Ramblers ranked in third place among domestic automobile sales, up from third on the strength of small-car sales, even in the face of a lot of new competition. Romney's strategic focus was very successful as reflected in the firm's healthy profits year after year. The company became completely debt- free. The financial success allowed the company to reach an agreement on August 26, 1961, with the United Auto Workers for a profit sharing plan that was new in the automobile industry. Its new three-year labor contract also included generous annual improvement pay increases, as well as automatic cost- of-living raises. However, in 1962, Romney resigned to run for Governor of Michigan. His replacement was Roy Abernethy, American Motors's successful sales executive. By 1964, Studebaker production in the United States had ended, and its Canadian operations ceased in 1966. The \\"Big Three\\", plus the smaller American Motors, Kaiser Jeep, International Harvester, Avanti, and Checker companies were the remaining North American auto manufacturers. Abernethy believed that American Motors's reputation of building reliable economical cars could be translated into a new strategy that could follow AMC buyers as they traded up into larger, more expensive vehicles. American Motors, in reality, had produced large cars throughout most of its history, The Rambler Ambassadors were every bit as large as a full-sized Ford or Chevy. There was only an absence of largest sized cars from the American Motors lineup in 1963 and 1964 The first cars bearing his signature were the 1965 models. These were a longer Ambassador series and new convertibles for the larger models. During mid-year a fastback, called the Marlin, was added. It competed directly with cars like the Dodge Charger, American Motors's \\"family- sized\\" car emphasized personal-luxury. Abernethy also called for the de- emphasis of the Rambler brand, because he believed the public associated it too strongly with economy cars, and that it was hindering the sale of American Motors's other models at a time when mid and luxury car sales were very strong. As a result, he ordered that for 1966, the Ambassador and Marlin were to be badged purely as a product of American Motors.http://wildaboutcarsonline.com/cgi- bin/pub9990262549620.cgi?itemid=9990287407543&categoryid;=9990287330870 This was followed by the 1968 Rebel. The new models shared fewer parts among each other and were more expensive to build. = Tough choices = The continuing quest \\"in the business world's toughest race ‚Äì the grinding contest against the Big Three automobile makers\\" also meant annual styling changes requiring large expenditures. American Motors's management total confidence \\"that the new 1965 models would stem a bothersome decline\\" actually began falling behind in share of sales. Moreover, a new line of redesigned cars in the full and mid-sized markets was launched in the fall of 1966. The cars won acclaim for their fluid styling, and Abernethy's ideas did work as Ambassador sales increased significantly. The dated designs of the Rambler Americans, however, hurt its sales which offset gains from Ambassador sales. There were quality control problems with the introduction of the new full-sized cars, as well as persistent rumors of the company's demise because of their precarious cash flow. Consumer Reports' negative ratings for American Motors's safety didn't help either. American Motors did not have their own electric car program as did the Big Three, and after some negotiation, a contract was drawn in 1967 with Gulton Industries to develop a new battery based on lithium and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. A nickel-cadmium battery powered 1969 Rambler station wagon demonstrated the power systems that according to the scientist was a \\"wonderful car\\". This was also the start of other \\"plug- in\\"-type experimental American Motors vehicles developed with Gulton ‚Äì the Amitron and the Electron. Abernethy was ousted from American Motors on January 9, 1967, and damage control fell to the new CEO, Roy D. Chapin Jr. (son of Hudson Motors founder Roy D. Chapin). Chapin quickly instituted changes to American Motors's offerings and tried to regain market share by focusing on younger demographic markets. Chapin's first decision was to cut the price of the Rambler to within US$200 of the basic Volkswagen Beetle. Innovative marketing ideas included making air conditioning standard on all 1968 Ambassador models (available as a delete option). This made American Motors the first U.S. automaker to make air conditioning standard equipment on a line of cars, preceding even luxury makes such as Lincoln, Imperial, and Cadillac. The company introduced exciting entries for the decade's muscle car boom, most notably the AMX, while the Javelin served as the company's entrant into the sporty \\"pony car\\" market created by the Ford Mustang. Additional operating cash was derived in 1968 through the sale of Kelvinator Appliance, once one of the firm's core operating units. The Kelvinator divestiture left American Motors a downsized company solely manufacturing automobiles. The Rambler brand was completely dropped after the 1969 model year in North America, although it continued to be used in several overseas markets as either a model or brand name, with the last use in Mexico in 1983. From 1970, American Motors was the brand used for all American Motors passenger cars; and all vehicles from that date bore the American Motors name and the new corporate logo. However, the names \\"American Motors\\" and \\"AMC\\" were used interchangeably in corporate literature well into the 1980s. The branding issue was further complicated when the company's Eagle all-wheel drive passenger cars were marketed as the American Eagle in the 1980s.  1970s product developments  Jeep Cherokee (SJ) Chief S 1972 Gremlin X 1975 second-generation Matador sedan 1971 Ambassador hardtop with \\"Brougham\\" trim 1974 Matador X Coupe AM General transit bus 1975 AMC Pacer 1976 Hornet Sportabout 1979 Concord two-door sedan 1979 Spirit GT Jeep In the late 1960s Kaiser Jeep Corporation (formerly Willys-Overland) decided to leave the automotive industry and sought a buyer for its money-losing Jeep division. American Motors's vice president for manufacturing, Gerald C. Meyers headed the team sent to evaluate Kaiser's Jeep factories. Although opposed by American Motors top management, Chapin made a major decision in February 1970 to purchase Kaiser's Jeep operations for $70 million. Although it was a gamble Chapin believed that Jeep vehicles would complement American Motors's passenger car business. The Jeep market was also a market in which the Big Three had no presence, and therefore there was no competition. American Motors gained the iconic Jeep brand of light trucks and SUVs, as well as Kaiser-Jeep's government contracts ‚Äì notably the M151 line of military Jeeps and the DJ-Series postal Jeeps. American Motors also expanded their international network. The military and special products business was reconstituted as American Motors General Products Division, later reorganized as AM General. Hornet and Gremlin In 1970, American Motors consolidated all passenger cars under one distinct brand identity and debuted the Hornet range of compact cars. The Hornet and the later Gremlin shared platforms. The Gremlin, the first North American-built subcompact, sold more than 670,000 units from 1970 to 1978. The Hornet became American Motors's best-selling passenger car since the Rambler Classic, with more than 860,000 units sold by the time production ended in 1977. The Hornet platform continued to be built under a variety of models through 1987. For a time, both the Hornet and Gremlin could be ordered with Levi's denim interiors. Matador The new facelifted, mid-sized AMC Matador replaced the Rebel in 1971, using an advertising campaign that asked, \\"What's a Matador?\\" In 1972, American Motors won the tender for Los Angeles Police Department cruisers, and Matadors were used by the department from 1972 to 1975, replacing the Plymouth Satellite. American Motors supplied Mark VII Limited owner Jack Webb with two Matadors, a sedan and a wagon, for use in his popular television series Adam-12, increasing the cars' public profile. In 1973, American Motors signed a licensing agreement with Curtiss-Wright to build Wankel engines for cars and Jeeps. Starting in 1974, the Matador sedan and station wagon were mildly refreshed, with new boxier front and rear ends. This second generation model was made virtually unchanged until 1978. Ambassador The Ambassador was redesigned and stretched to become the biggest ever, just as the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo sparked gasoline rationing across the nation. The additional length was due to a new front end design and stronger energy-absorbing bumpers required of all automobiles sold in the U.S. Sales of all large cars fell due to economic problems and rising gasoline prices. The full-sized Ambassador was discontinued as American Motors's flagship line after the 1974 model year, leaving only the Matador as American Motors's full-size offering. Nash and American Motors made Ambassadors from 1927 to 1974, the longest use of the same model name for any American Motors product and, at the time, the longest continuously used nameplate in the industry. Matador Coupe In 1974, the first- generation Matador two-door hardtop, known as the \\"flying brick\\" due to its poor aerodynamics in NASCAR competition, was replaced at great cost with a sleek, smoothly shaped, and radically styled two-door coupe. The model received praise for its design, including \\"Best Styled Car of 1974\\" by Car and Driver magazine, customer satisfaction, and sold almost 100,000 coupes over a five-year period. The Matador Coupe shared few components with the Matador sedan and station wagon other than suspension, drive train, some trim, and interior parts. Metropolitan Buses In 1974, American Motors's AM General subsidiary began building urban transit buses in cooperation with Flyer Industries of Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Metropolitan coach had sold 5,212 units when production ceased in 1978. Pacer The AMC Pacer, an innovative all-new model introduced in March 1975 and marketed as \\"the first wide small car\\", was a subcompact designed to provide the comfort of a full-sized car. Its pre- production development coincided tightened U.S. Federal passenger emissions and auto safety regulations. With the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, General Motors aborted the Wankel rotary engine around which the Pacer had been designed, as its fuel consumption exceeded that of conventional engines with similar power. Therefore, American Motors's existing AMC Straight-6 engines were used in the Pacer instead. Fuel economy was better than a rotary but still relatively poor in light of the new focus on energy efficiency. Also, as the Pacer shared few components other than drivetrain with other American Motors cars, it was expensive to make and the cost increased when sales fell steeply after the first two years. Development and production costs for the Pacer and Matador Coupe drained capital which might otherwise have been invested in updating the more popular Hornet and Gremlin lines so that toward the end of the 1970s the company faced the growing energy crisis with aged products that were uncompetitive in hotly contested markets. However, \\"AMC used cars, as far back as 1967, had the advantage of good warranty coverage ‚Ä¶ so most owners were conscious of low-cost car maintenance ‚Ä¶ AMC units [became] some of the very best buys on the used car market\\" by 1975. The 1977 Gremlin had redesigned headlights, grille, rear hatch, and fascia. For economy in the fuel crisis, American Motors offered the car with a more fuel-efficient Volkswagen-designed Audi 4-cylinder engine . The engine was expensive for American Motors to build and the Gremlin retained the less costly but also less economical as standard equipment. The AMX nameplate was revived in 1977. It was a sporty appearance package on the Hornet hatchback featuring upgrades, as well as the inline six as standard with a choice of three-speed automatic or four-speed manual transmissions. The V8 engine was optional with the automatic transmission. As all Matadors now received standard equipment that was formerly optional (e.g. power steering, automatic transmission), the \\"Brougham\\" package was dropped. Optional on the Matador coupe was a landau vinyl roof with opera windows, and top-line Barcelonas offered new two-tone paint. Concord For 1978, the Hornet platform was redesigned with an adaptation of the new Gremlin front-end design and renamed AMC Concord. American Motors targeted it at the emerging \\"premium compact\\" market segment, paying particular attention to ride and handling, standard equipment, trim, and interior luxury. Gremlins borrowed the Concord instrument panel, as well as a Hornet AMX-inspired GT sports appearance package and a new striping treatment for X models. The AMC Pacer hood was modified to clear a V8 engine, and a Sports package replaced the former X package. With falling sales of Matador Coupes, sedans and wagons, their V8 engine was dropped, leaving only the Inline-6 (standard on coupes and sedans) and the V8 (optional on coupes and sedans, standard on wagons). The two-tone Barcelona luxury package was offered on Matador sedans, and two-tone red paint introduced as an additional Barcelona option. Matador production ceased at the end of the model year with total sales of 10,576 units. The Matador was no longer attractive as automakers struggled to overcome economic woes including continuing fuel price increases and double-digit domestic inflation. Spirit In 1979, the Spirit sedan replaced the Gremlin. A new fastback version of the car, the Spirit Liftback, proved successful. In December, Pacer production ceased after a small run of 1980 models was built to use up parts stock. Concords received a new front end treatment, and in their final season, hatchbacks became available in DL trim. On May 1, 1979, American Motors marked the 25th anniversary of the Nash-Hudson merger with \\"Silver Anniversary\\" editions of the AMC Concord and Jeep CJ in two-tone silver (Jeeps then accounted for around 50 percent of the company's sales and most of their profits); and introduced LeCar, a U.S. version of the small, fuel-efficient Renault 5, in dealer showrooms. Concord and Spirit models were dropped after 1983.  Financial developments, Renault partnership  = Late 1970s = 1978 AMC Concord AMC Spirit liftback 1981 AMC Concord Jeep Grand Wagoneer In February 1977, Time magazine reported that although American Motors had lost $73.8 million in the previous two fiscal years, U.S. banks had agreed to a year's extension for a $72.5 million credit that had expired in January; that stockholders had received no dividends since 1974; and that Pacer sales did not match expectations. However, Time noted record Jeep sales and a backlog of orders for AM General's buses. On October 21, 1977, Roy Chapin Jnr. retired and Gerald C. Meyers became Chairman and CEO. On March 31, 1978, American Motors and Renault announced a sweeping agreement for the joint manufacture and distribution of cars and trucks that would achieve benefits for both. A month later, American Motors announced that it would halt the production of standard urban transit buses after about 4,300 were sold by its AM General subsidiary over a period of three years. In May 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered the recall of all American Motors's 1976 cars (except those conforming to California emissions regulations) ‚Äì some 270,000 vehicles‚Äî plus 40,000 1975 and 1976 Jeeps and mini trucks, for correction of a fault in the pollution control system. Total cost was estimated at up to $3 million‚Äîmore than AMC had earned the previous quarter. American Motors lost an estimated $65 million on its conventional (non-Jeep) cars for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1978, but strong Jeep sales helped the company to an overall $36.7 million profit on sales of $2.6 billion. However, American Motors faced costly engineering work to bring their Jeeps into compliance with a federal directive for all 4-wheel-drive vehicles to average by 1981. A year later, with its share of the American market at 1.83%, the company struck a deal with Renault, the nationally owned French automaker. American Motors would receive a $150 million cash injection, $50 million in credits, and also the rights to start building the Renault 5 in 1982. (A deal for Renault products to be sold through the American Motors-Jeep dealer network had already been made in 1979). In return, Renault acquired a 22.5% interest in American Motors. This was not the first time the two companies had worked together. Lacking its own prestige model line in the early 1960s, Renault assembled CKD kits and marketed Rambler cars in France. In 1979, American Motors announced a record $83.9 million profit on sales of $3.1 billion (US$ in dollars) for the fiscal year ending in September‚Äîthis despite an economic downturn, soaring energy prices, rising American unemployment, automobile plants shutting down, and an American market trend towards imported cars. =1980s= In 1980, all American Motors cars received a new rust-proofing process called Ziebart Factory Rust Protection. This included aluminized trim screws, plastic inner fender liners, galvanized steel in every exterior body panel, and a deep-dip (up to the window line) bath in epoxy-based primer. American Motors backed up the rust protection program with a 5-year \\"No Rust Thru\\" component to its comprehensive \\"Buyer Protection Plan\\". A drop in Jeep sales caused by the declining economy and soaring energy prices began to constrict American Motors's cash flow. At the same time, pressure increased on the company's non-Jeep product lines. The face-lifts and rebranding of American Motors's once-innovative and successful cars were not enough in a competitive landscape that had changed dramatically. No longer was the threat limited to the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). The Japanese manufacturers (Honda, Toyota, Nissan) used streamlined production methods such as outsourcing and Just In Time (JIT) supply-chain management. They had new, highly efficient assembly plants in the United States. And now they targeted the heart of American Motors's passenger product line: small cars. While Americans turned to the new imports in increasing numbers, American Motors continued its struggle at the inefficient and aging Kenosha, Wisconsin, facilities‚Äîthe oldest continuously operating automobile plant in the world, where components and unfinished bodies still had to be transported across the city. In early 1980, the banks refused American Motors further credit. Lacking both capital and resources for the new, truly modern products it needed to offer, the company turned to Renault for a $90 million loan (US$ in dollars). By September that year, American Motors's U.S. market share had fallen to 1.7%, and in November sales dropped 19.1%. American Motors warned stockholders that the company could be bankrupted if they did not approve a plan for Renault to acquire as much as 59% of the company. On December 16, 1980, American Motors shareholders \\"overwhelmingly approved making the French Government-owned Renault\\" their company's principal owner. Jean-Marc Lepeu, former corporate treasurer at Renault, became vice president for finance at American Motors. In September 1981, Jose Dedeurwaerder, a Renault veterans of 23 years, mainly in manufacturing, became American Motors's executive vice president for manufacturing.https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/07/business/at- franco-american-motors-paris-takes-the-wheel.html?searchResultPosition=68 In January 1982 the company's former president W. Paul Tippett Jr. replaced Gerald C. Meyers as chairman and CEO, and Dedeurwaerder moved up to president. By this time Renault owned 46% of American Motors. Dedeurwaerder brought a broad perspective at this critical time: he is credited with streamlining many of American Motors's arcane management techniques. He also instituted important improvements in plant layouts, as well as in cost and quality control. Renault, having increased its stake in the company several times to keep it solvent, eventually owned 49% in 1983. This development effectively ended American Motors's run as a truly American car company. New ownership and new management heralded a new product venture for American Motors: a line of modern front-wheel drive cars, designed by Renault, to be produced at Kenosha.  1980s product developments  = AMC Eagle = 1981 AMC Eagle Wagon. In August 1979, for the 1980 model year, American Motors introduced four-wheel- drive versions of the Spirit and Concord, calling the collective line the AMC Eagle. Eagles rapidly became one of the company's best-known products and are considered one of the first \\"crossover SUVs\\". Eagles used the 2-wheel drive body shells mounted on an all-new platform developed by American Motors in the late 1970s. Featuring an innovative full-time four-wheel-drive system, it sold best in snow-prone areas. Sales started strongly but declined over time. While the two-wheel drive Spirit and Concord were both discontinued after 1983 as the company concentrated on its new Renault Alliance, the Eagle survived for five years longer, albeit only in station wagon form, into the 1988 model year. This meant the four-wheel-drive Eagle was the lone representative of the American Motors brand from 1984 to 1988. All the company's remaining output was branded Renault or Jeep. The last AMC Eagle was built on December 14, 1987. = Renault Alliance, Encore & GTA = The Renault Alliance, based on the Renault 9, was built by American Motors Corporation from 1983 to 1987 The Renault Alliance was the first joint product of the American Motors-Renault partnership. Introduced in 1983, the Alliance was a front-wheel-drive Renault 9 compact car slightly restyled for the American market by Dick Teague, mostly to comply with American safety standards, and produced by American Motors at Kenosha. The car was badged as a Renault and some cars also carried American Motors badges. It was available as a sedan with two or four doors and later as a convertible. The hatchback, introduced in 1984 and badged as the Renault Encore, was basically the same as the European Renault 11 model. For the final 1987 model year, a higher-performance version of the Alliance 2 door sedan and the convertible was sold as the Renault GTA.The One To Watch: 1987 Renault GTA brochure, www.hemmings.com Retrieved April 24, 2018 This version had a Renault two-liter engine that was exclusive to it and not shared with the European Renault 9 and 11 models. The new model, introduced at a time of increased interest in small cars, won several awards including Motor Trend Car of the Year. Motor Trend declared: \\"The Alliance may well be the best-assembled first-year car we‚Äôve ever seen. Way to go Renault!\\" The Alliance was listed as number one on Car and Driver's list of Ten Best cars for 1983. The positive reception and sales of 200,000 Alliances by 1984 was hindered by the availability of only two body styles. The Alliance was a European-designed car and not fully suited to U.S. market demands. The distribution network was also not well supported, which led to the lower quality delivered by dealerships with \\"disastrous consequences\\" for the image of the automobiles, as well as high warranty costs because of quality failings which greatly impacted sales from 1985 to the end of production in 1987. The Encore models were renamed Alliance Hatchback in 1987. Alliance and GTA production ended in June of that year while the Renault 9 and 11 models continued through the 1988 model year in Europe, being replaced by the all-new Renault 19. = Jeeps = Jeep Cherokee Laredo Jeep Comanche Pioneer More beneficial to American Motors's future was the introduction of an all-new line of compact Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer models in the autumn of 1983 for the 1984 model year. The popularity of these downsized Jeeps pioneered a new market segment for what later became defined as the sport utility vehicle (SUV). They initially used the American Motors 150 C.I.D. (2.5L) OHV four-cylinder engine with a carburetor, and a General Motors-built carbureted V6 was optional. In 1986, throttle-body injection replaced the carburetor on the 2.5 L I4 engines. A Renault Turbo- Diesel I4 diesel was also offered. Starting with the 1987 models, a I6 engine, derived from the older I6 with a new head design and an electronic fuel injection system, replaced the outsourced V6. American Motors' \\"new\\" engine was designed with help from Renault and incorporated Renault-Bendix (Renix) parts for fuel and ignition management. The 4.0 developed an outstanding reputation for reliability and toughness. Retained by Chrysler after the buyout, the design continued to be improved and refined until its discontinuation at the end of the 2006 model year. The 4.0 engine saw extensive application in XJ Cherokees and Wagoneers, Grand Cherokees, and Wranglers, and many of those engines saw (or are seeing) extremely long lives, quite a few exceeding . The XJ Cherokee itself was built by Chrysler until the end of the 2001 model year in the U.S. and until 2005 in China. Three other designs continued to be used after the Chrysler buyout: the Grand Wagoneer full-size luxury SUV, the full-sized J-series pickups, built on the same chassis as the earlier SJ model Wagoneers and Cherokees that dated from 1963 with the AMC V8, and the Jeep Comanche (MJ) compact pickup, which debuted in 1986. Unlike most sport-utility vehicles that are based on adapted pickup truck designs, the Cherokee XJ SUV came first and the Comanche was designed as a later pickup truck version. Production of the full-sized pickups ceased after 1987. The Grand Wagoneer and 360 V8 engine were dropped after 1991 (the last American-made vehicle whose engine used a carburetor for fuel delivery), and the Comanche bowed after 1992.  1985 and the final buyout  = Marketplace and management changes = There were significant changes in 1985 as the market moved away from American Motors's small models. With fuel relatively cheap again, buyers turned to larger more powerful automobiles and American Motors was unprepared for this development. Even the venerable Jeep CJ-5 was dropped after a 60 Minutes TV news magazine expos√© of rollover tendencies under extreme conditions. American Motors also confronted an angry workforce. Labor was taking revenge, and reports circulated about sabotage of vehicles on the assembly lines because of the failure to receive promised wage increases. There were rumors that the aging Kenosha plant was to be shut down. At the same time, Chrysler was having trouble meeting the demand for its M-body rear-drive models (Dodge Diplomat, Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler Fifth Avenue). Because they were assembled using the old \\"gate and buck system\\" and the tooling could be easily moved, Chrysler could supply the components and control the quality, while American Motors assembled the car. Therefore, Lee Iacocca and Joe Cappy reached an agreement to use some of American Motors's idle plant capacity in Kenosha. These problems came in the midst of a transfer of power at American Motors from Paul Tippet to a French executive, Pierre Semerena. The new management responded with tactical moves by selling the lawn care Wheel Horse Products Division and signing an agreement to build Jeeps in the People's Republic of China. The Pentagon had problems with AM General, a significant defense contractor, being managed by a partially French-government-owned firm. The U.S. government would not allow a foreign government to own a significant portion of an important defense supplier. As a result, the profitable AM General Division was sold. Another milestone was the departure of Dick Teague; American Motors's design vice president for 26 years, he was responsible for many Jeep and AMC designs including the Rambler American, Javelin, Hornet, Gremlin, Pacer, and Matador coupe. = Problems at Renault and assassination = American Motors's major stockholder, Renault, was itself experiencing financial trouble in France. The investment in American Motors (including the construction of a new Canadian assembly plant in Brampton, Ontario) forced cuts at home, resulting in the closure of several French plants and mass layoffs. Renault was down to just three alternatives regarding its American holdings: (1) They could declare American Motors officially bankrupt thereby lose its investment; (2) They could come up with more money, but Renault management perceived American Motors as a bottomless pit; or (3) American Motors could be put up for sale and the French could get back part of their investment. Against these detractions, Renault's chairman, Georges Besse, continued to champion the French firm's future in the North American market; pointing to the company's completion of the newest and most-advanced automotive assembly plant in North America, then known as Bramalea Assembly, as well as the recent introduction of the thoroughly modern, fuel-injected 4.0 L and 2.5 L engines. In addition, Jeep vehicles were riding an unprecedented surge in demand. It seemed to Besse and others that American Motors was on course for profitability. However, on November 17, 1986, Besse, who had a high-profile among French capitalists, was assassinated by a member of a French clandestine far-left extremist group, Action directe. = Chrysler purchases American Motors Stock = Under pressure from Renault executives following Besse's death, Renault's new president, Raymond Levy, set out to repair employee relations and divest the company of its investment in American Motors. Renault owned 46.1% of American Motors's outstanding shares of stock. In 1986 American Motors had lost $91.3 million. The earlier agreement between Chrysler and American Motors in 1985, under which American Motors would produce M-body chassis rear-drive large cars for two years from 1986 to 1988, fed the rumor that Chrysler was about to buy AMC. According to the head of manufacturing for Chrysler at the time, Stephan Sharf, the existing relationship with American Motors producing a car for a competitor facilitated the negotiations. The Jeep Grand Cherokee was the driving force behind Chrysler's buyout of American Motors; Lee Iacocca wanted the design. Chrysler completed development and released it to the public in late 1992, and continues to use the nameplate today. On March 9, 1987, Chrysler agreed to buy Renault's share in American Motors, plus all the remaining shares, for about $1.5 billion ($ in dollars). American Motors became the Jeep-Eagle division of Chrysler. It was the Jeep brand that Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca really wanted ‚Äì in particular the ZJ Grand Cherokee, then under development by Jeep engineers, which ultimately proved highly profitable for Chrysler (the nameplate remains in production today). However, the buyout included other attractive deal sweeteners for Chrysler. Among them was the world-class, brand-new manufacturing plant in Bramalea, Ontario, which offered Iacocca an unprecedented opportunity to increase his company's production capacity at a fire-sale price. American Motors had designed and built the plant in anticipation of building the Renault 25-based Eagle Premier. Additional profitable acquisitions were the American Motors dealer network (the addition of which strengthened Chrysler's retail distribution ‚Äì many American Motors dealers switched to selling Chrysler products); and American Motors's underrated organization and management talent ‚Äì which Chrysler quickly assimilated (numerous leading Chrysler engineers and executives were ex-American Motors). American Motors was renamed Jeep Eagle Corporation (a Chrysler subsidiary) August 25, 1988, and was fully merged as of March 29, 1990. The sale came at a time when the automotive press was enthusiastic about the proposed 1988 lineup of Renault, Eagle and Jeep vehicles, and reports that the financial outlook for the tiny automaker was improving. American Motors quarterly results for all of 1987 were positive, Chrysler purchased American Motors at a time the company appeared to be in a very good financial position with its new product line.  Business legacy  American Motors was forced to constantly innovate for 33 years until Chrysler absorbed it in 1987. The lessons learned from this experience were integrated into the company that bought American Motors. The organization, strategies, as well as several key executives, allowed Chrysler to gain an edge on the competition. Even today, the lessons gained from the American Motors experience continue to provide benefits to other firms in the industry. There are a number of legacies from American Motors's business strategies. American Motors had an ability to formulate strategies that were often evaluated by industry critics as \\"strokes of brilliance\\". According to Roy D. Chapin Jr., American Motors realized they were up against the giants of the industry, so to compete successfully they had to be able to move quickly and with ingenuity. An essential strategy practiced by American Motors was to rely on outside vendors to supply components in which they had differential advantages. This approach was finally accepted within the U.S. auto industry, but only after each of the Big Three experienced the failure of attempting to be self-sufficient. The smallest domestic automaker did not have \\"the massive R&D; budgets of General Motors, Ford, and foreign competitors ‚Ä¶ [thus] American Motors placed R&D; emphasis on bolstering the product life cycle of its prime products (particularly Jeeps).\\" In 1985, American Motors originated product lifecycle management (PLM) as a strategic business approach according to Sidney Hill, Jr., executive editor for Manufacturing Business Technology, in an effort to better compete against its much larger rivals by ramping up its product development process. Another example of American Motors's agility was the ability of management to squeeze money out of reluctant bankers, even in the face of bankruptcy. These core abilities helped save the company from collapse and after each obstacle, give it the wherewithal to keep it operating. Ironically, American Motors was never stronger than just before its demise. American Motors's managers anticipated important trends in the automotive industry. It preached fuel efficiency in the 1950s, long before most auto buyers demanded it. Led by American Motors's Rambler and several European cars, the small car innovation reduced the Big Three's market share from 93% in 1957 to 82% in 1959. The company inherited foreign manufacturing and sales partnerships from Nash and continued developing business relations, decades before most of the international consolidations among automobile makers took place. American Motors was the first U.S. automaker to establish ownership agreement with a foreign automaker, Renault. Although small in size, American Motors was able to introduce numerous industry innovations. Starting in 1957, American Motors was the only U.S. manufacturer to totally immerse all automobile bodies in primer paint for protection against rust, until competitors adopted the practice in 1964. Even one of American Motors's most expensive new product investments (the Pacer) established many features that were later adopted by the auto industry worldwide. These included aerodynamic body design, space-efficient interiors, aircraft-style doors, and a large greenhouse for visibility. American Motors was also effective in other areas such as marketing by introducing low rate financing. American Motors's four- wheel-drive vehicles established the foundation for the modern SUV market segments, and \\"classic\\" Jeep models continue to be the benchmark in this field. Roy D. Chapin drew on his experiences as a hunter and fisherman and marketed the Jeep brand successfully to people with like interests. The brand developed a cult appeal that continues. The purchase of American Motors was instrumental in reviving Chrysler. According to Robert Lutz, former President of Chrysler, the American Motors acquisition was a big and risky undertaking. The purchase was part of Chrysler's strategic \\"retreat-cum-diversification\\" plan that he states did not have the right focus. Initially, the goal was to obtain the world-renowned Jeep brand. However, Lutz discovered that the decision to buy American Motors turned out to be a gold mine for Chrysler. At that time, Chrysler's management was attempting to find a model to improve structure and operations, \\"something that would help get our minds unstuck and thinking beyond the old paradigms that we were so familiar with\\". In this transformation, \\"Chrysler's acquisition of AMC was one of the all-time great moments in corporate serendipity\\" according to Lutz \\" that most definitely played a key role in demonstrating how to accomplish change\\". According to Lutz (1993), while American Motors had its share of problems, it was far from being a bunch of \\"brain-dead losers\\". He describes the \\"troops\\" at American Motors as more like the Wake Island Marines in battle, \\"with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy, they were able to roll out an impressive succession of new products\\". After first reacting with anger to the purchase, Chrysler managers soon anticipated the benefits. To further solidify the organizational competencies held by American Motors, Lee Iacocca agreed to retain former American Motors units, such as engineering, completely intact. In addition, American Motors's lead engineer, Fran√ßois Castaing, was made head of all engineering at Chrysler. In an unthinkable strategic move, Castaing completely dismantled the entrenched Chrysler groups. In their place, American Motors's \\"platform team\\" was implemented. These were close-knit cross- functional groups responsible for the whole vehicle, as contrasted with Chrysler's highly functional structure. In this capacity, Castaing's strategy was to eliminate the corporate administrative overhead bureaucracy. This move shifted corporate culture and agitated veteran executives who believed that Chrysler's reputation as \\"the engineering company\\" was being destroyed. Yet, according to the popular press, by the 1980s Chrysler's reputation was totally shot, and in Lutz's view only dramatic action was going to change that. In summary, Chrysler's purchase of American Motors laid the critical foundation to help re-establish a strategy for its revival in the 1990s. Top managers at Chrysler after the AMC buyout appeared to have made errors similar to those by American Motors. For example, Chrysler invested heavily in new untested models while not keeping up its profitable high-volume lines. The American Motors influence also continued at General Motors. GM recruited a new executive team to turn itself from near bankruptcy in the early 2000s. Among the new strategists at GM was Lutz who brought an understanding of the importance of passion in the product design. Lutz implemented a new thinking at GM that incorporated the systems and structures that originated from American Motors's lean and focused operations. Renault implemented the lessons it learned from its investment in American Motors. The French firm took a parallel approach as it did with its initial ownership of American Motors and applied it to resurrect the money-losing Nissan automaker in Japan. In 2009, in a deal brokered by the Obama administration, Italian automaker Fiat initiated a white knight takeover of Chrysler to save the struggling automaker from liquidation. The deal was immediately compared to the American Motors-Renault deal; some commentators noted the irony in that Chrysler now faced the same fate that American Motors faced 30 years earlier, while others expressed skepticism of whether the Italian firm could save Chrysler, given how the Renault deal failed. However, there were key differences between the two: *Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne became CEO of Chrysler as part of the deal and immediately began globally integrating Fiat and Chrysler's assets and product lines; *the Fiat- Chrysler merger did not face the political opposition the American Motors- Renault deal did since Fiat is led by a family group with significant equity and the US government supported the merger; *while American Motors proved to be a continuous money-loser for Renault, Chrysler returned to profitability fairly quickly and has since become an important source of revenue and profits for Fiat, which has been struggling to maintain volume and profitability amid the European debt crisis. The two firms would later fully merge to create Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014.  Legacy of products  = Passenger automobiles = Eagle Premier Chrysler revived the \\"Spirit\\" name dropped by American Motors after 1983 for use on one of its A platform cars, (the Dodge Spirit) from 1989 to 1995. The planned Renault Medallion was sold as the Eagle Medallion in 1988 and 1989. The planned all-new 1988 Renault Premier, a joint development effort between American Motors and Renault, and for which the Brampton Assembly plant (Brampton, Ontario‚Äîoriginally called the Bramalea Plant) was built, was sold by Chrysler as the 1988‚Äì1992 Eagle Premier, with a rebadged Dodge Monaco variant available from 1990 to 1992. The full-sized Premier's platform was far more advanced than anything Chrysler was building at the time. After some re-engineering and a re-designation to Chrysler code LH, the Eagle Premier went on to form the backbone of Chrysler's passenger car lineup during the 1990s as the Chrysler Concorde (a revived model name that was briefly used by Plymouth in 1951 and 1952), Chrysler New Yorker, Chrysler LHS, Dodge Intrepid, and Eagle Vision. Plymouth almost received their own rendition of the LH platform, which was to be called the Accolade, but Chrysler decided to nix this idea not long before LH production started. The Chrysler 300M was likewise a Premier/LH-derived car and was initially to have been the next-generation Eagle Vision, until the Eagle brand was dropped after 1998. The LH Platform was subsequently re-engineered, using Mercedes-Benz components, into the Chrysler LX Platform which remains in production today underpinning the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger. = Jeep vehicles = Jeep Comanche Chrysler marketed the SJ Jeep Grand Wagoneer until 1991, leaving it almost entirely unaltered from the final American Motors rendition before the buyout. The Jeep Comanche pickup truck remained until 1992, while the Cherokee remained until 2001 in the U.S. (the XJ Cherokee was produced in China through 2006 as the Cherokee 2500 [2.5L] and Cherokee 4000 [4.0L]). Although it was not introduced until 1993, the Jeep Grand Cherokee was initially an American Motors-developed vehicle. Traces of American Motors remained within. American Motors's Toledo, Ohio, plants continued to manufacture the Jeep Wrangler and Liberty, as well as parts and components for Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep vehicles (although Toledo Machining and Forge were closed in 2005). American Motors's main plant in Wisconsin, albeit heavily downsized, operated as the Kenosha Engine Plant, producing engines for several Chrysler Group products including the Wrangler. The plant was closed as part of the post-bailout restructuring of Chrysler in October 2010. The engine was used until the 2006 model year by DaimlerChrysler in the Jeep Wrangler. American Motors's technologically advanced Bramalea Assembly and Stamping Plants in Brampton, Ontario, later produced the LX-cars ‚Äì the Dodge Charger and the Chrysler 300, and the now discontinued Dodge Magnum. In terms of American Motors-related parts, some were used as late as 2006, when the Jeep Wrangler (the last new product introduced by American Motors before the Chrysler deal) was still using the AMC Straight-6 engine in some models, as well as the recessed \\"paddle\\" door handles that were used since the 1968 model year by American Motors. Both were retired when the Wrangler was completely redesigned for the 2007 model year. AM General, sold by American Motors in 1982, is still in business building the American Motors-designed Humvee for American and allied militaries. AM General also built the now-discontinued civilian variant ‚Äì the H1 ‚Äì and manufactured a Chevrolet Tahoe-derived companion, the H2, under contract to GM, who acquired the rights to the civilian Hummer brand in 1999. GM was forced to phase out the Hummer brand in early 2010 as a part of its bankruptcy restructuring after offering it for sale, but failing to find a suitable buyer. Although Chrysler introduced new logos for its brands in the 1990s and again in 2010 after the Fiat Group took control of the company, Jeep still uses the American Motors-era logo introduced shortly after American Motors's purchase of the brand in 1970. Until the Chrysler purchase, Jeep's logo also featured the American Motors emblem.  International legacy  Beginning in 1960, American Motors's executive vice president of international operations Roy D. Chapin Jr., embarked on a strong international campaign to set up importation and local assembly operations of American Motors vehicles around the world. Over the next few years, Chapin was successful in establishing or re-establishing vehicle assembly operations in Argentina, Australia, Belgium (via Renault of France), Costa Rica, Germany, Iran, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa and Venezuela. He also strengthened import operations into the United Kingdom, which had already a long history of importing and assembling Hudson and Essex/Terraplane motor vehicles prior to the merger. The Rambler Classic would even become the basis of Argentina's future national car, the Torino. With American Motors's acquisition of Jeep in 1970, American Motors inherited all existing international Jeep operations which helped sustain American Motors during the 1970s and 1980s. While the Rambler marque had been dropped in the United States after 1967, all export markets retained the Rambler name, with the longest to retain it being Mexico up until 1983.

Legacy of divisions and facilities  = Former divisions = During its history, American Motors bought or created, then later sold and divested itself of several specialized divisions, some which continue to exist today: Kelvinator, the subdivision of Nash-Kelvinator, was sold by American Motors in 1968 to White Consolidated Industries and subsequently became part of Electrolux. The Kelvinator Company is still in business. Jeep is now a brand of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Many Jeep models retained the mechanical specifications and styling cues that were developed by American Motors well into the 1990s or even into the first decade of the 2000s. AM General is now owned by MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings and the Renco Group. It was organized as an LLC in August 2004. Wheel Horse Products Division is now owned by the Toro Company. Beijing Jeep was established by American Motors in 1983 to produce Jeeps for the burgeoning Chinese market; the joint venture was inherited by Chrysler and continues under the ownership of the new Chrysler. American Motors's trials with the venture were the subject of a fairly well-known book on the venture, \\"Beijing Jeep\\", by James Mann. = Facilities = American Motors World Headquarters (1954‚Äì1975) was located at 14250 Plymouth Road in Detroit and was widely known as the Plymouth Road Office Center (PROC). In 1975, American Motors moved its headquarters from the facility on Plymouth Road to a newly constructed building on Northwestern Highway in Southfield, Michigan, known as the American Center. The initial building had been built in 1926‚Äì27 by the Electric Refrigeration Corporation (subsequently Nash-Kelvinator) with design by Amedeo Leoni, industrial layout by Wallace McKenzie, and tower enclosure and industrial units by William E. Kapp, of SHG. The original three-story factory and four-story administration building had been headquarters to Nash- Kelvinator from 1937 to 1954 as well as a factory for refrigerators, electric ranges, and commercial refrigeration‚Äîas well as airplane propellers for the U.S. military effort during World War II. During World War II, the U.S. War Department contracted with Nash-Kelvinator to produce 900 Sikorsky R-6 model helicopters. As part of that contract, a site north of the factory was used as the smallest airport in the world as a flight testing base. Nash-Kelvinator produced about fifty R-6s a month during the war. When the contract was terminated at the end of the war, a total of 262 helicopters had been constructed. During Chrysler's occupancy of the complex, it was known Jeep and (Dodge) Truck Engineering (JTE), including facilities for Body on Frame (BoF) work as well as testing facilities and labs. The buildings included , approximately one third devoted to engineering and computer functions. As of 2007, Chrysler still employed over 1,600 people at the complex, moving those operations in mid-2009 to the Chrysler Technology Center. PROC was made available for sale by Chrysler in early 2010. It was bought be a local man who gutted the building for scrap and left it in a dilapidated state before losing it to foreclosure. The abandoned building was in possession of the city of Detroit and officials were considering if the industrial site would be more marketable if the building was torn down. In 2018, the Wayne County Commission approved a land swap that included a new jail complex for the county as well as a potential revival for the old American Motors building. * American Center ‚Äì American Motors's corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan, is still standing, still open, and still called \\"American Center\\". The original \\"American Center\\" signage at the top of the building remained until 2005, although the American Motors logo has been removed. The signage has since been changed to Charter One. The 25-story building is rented to several different organizations and companies as office space. After the Chrysler acquisition, Chrysler Financial occupied as much as of the building. * Toledo South Assembly Plants ‚Äì Torn down by Chrysler in 2007. Until it was demolished, still visible on most of the signage on the outside of the factories were areas where Chrysler painted over the American Motors logo. * Toledo Forge ‚Äì Torn down by Chrysler in 2007. * Brampton (formerly Bramalea) Assembly and Satellite Stamping Plants. ‚Äì still in use by Chrysler. American Motors designed this US$260 million (US$ in dollars), plant, which was operational by 1986. This plant was designed and built by American Motors for the specific purpose of building the Eagle Premier. Like the older Brampton plant (see \\"Former Factory Facilities\\", below), this factory was also part of American Motors Canada, Inc., and with the Chrysler buyout in 1987, became part of Chrysler Canada Limited. The plant currently builds the LX series of vehicles including the Chrysler 300, the Dodge Charger. Also Producing a slightly modified version of the lX series; renamed the LC series; supporting the Dodge Challenger nameplate. * Kenosha \\"Main\\" Plant ‚Äì Portions of the Kenosha Main Plant (later Chrysler's Kenosha Engine plant with some new additions) at 52nd Street and 30th Avenue continued to be run by Chrysler as an engine-production factory. This plant closed in October 2010 as part of Chrysler LLC's Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure which resulted from the automotive industry crisis. Demolition of the plant began in early December 2012. * Canadian Fabricated Products Ltd. ‚Äì An American Motors division (part of AMC Canada, Ltd.) in Stratford, Ontario; established 1971 and sold post-buyout by DaimlerChrysler in 1994; produced automotive interior trim. * Guelph Products ‚Äì An American Motors division (also part of AMC Canada, Ltd.) in Guelph, Ontario; opened in 1987, and subsequently sold by Chrysler in early 1993; the operation supplied molded plastic components to the Brampton Assembly Plant. * Coleman Products Corporation ‚Äì An American Motors subsidiary in Coleman, Wisconsin. Manufactured automotive wiring harnesses for American Motors and other automakers. (Not the same as Coleman Company) * Evart Products Co. ‚Äì An American Motors subsidiary in Evart, Michigan. The plant was established in 1953 with 25 workers and eventually expanded to over 1,200, becoming Osceola County's largest employer. This factory manufactured injection molded plastic parts (notably, grilles) for American Motors (supplying 90% of in-house needs), as well as for other automakers. In 1966, Products Wire Harness was built. After Chrysler's purchase of American Motors, Collins & Aikman took over the factory. * Mercury Plastics Co. ‚Äì Mercury Plastics operated a plant at 34501 Harper Ave., Mt. Clemens, Michigan. The company was acquired in 1973 for 611,111 shares of American Motors stock. The company produced plastic parts for American Motors, as well as for uses in other industries. * Windsor Plastics Co. ‚Äì Windsor Plastics, 601 North Congress Avenue, Evansville, Indiana, was acquired in 1970. The division produced plastic parts for American Motors and other industries. The company was sold to Guardian Industries in 1982, and underwent a name change to Guardian Automotive Trim, Inc. It is still in operation today. The original factory in Evansville continues to manufacture plastic parts for the OEM and aftermarket automotive industries. Items manufactured include grilles, bezels, and other parts. * The American Motors Proving Grounds ‚Äì The former American Motors Proving Grounds in Burlington, Wisconsin, had initially been Nash's test track and subsequently became Jeep's test facilities (after American Motors's acquisition of Willys in the 1970s). The grounds fell into disuse after Chrysler's takeover of American Motors in 1987 and subsequently became the engineering and test facility for MGA Research. The company rents out this proving grounds to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), for \\"ride-and-drive\\" events by automakers, as well as for movies and commercials. * Axle tooling equipment ‚Äì sold in 1985 to Dana Holding Corporation, and they named the AMC-15 axles as Dana 35. Dana manufactured the AMC-20 axles for AM General's Hummer H1. The company also continues to produce the AMC-15 axle as well; however they have been upgraded from American Motors's original design with multiple variations (including front axle designs). * Holmes Foundry, Ltd. ‚Äì American Motors's block-casting foundry was a major American Motors factory which is now completely obliterated. Holmes had its main office and foundry at 200 Exmouth Street, Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Holmes was established in 1918, by Mr. J. S. Blunt, and was called Holmes Blunt Limited. In the early years, Ford Motor Company contracted the plant for a steady supply of engine casting blocks. This factory had a reputation locally as a dirty, dangerous place to work. The company had three divisions, all operating on one site at the edge of Sarnia. Beginning in 1962, American Motors contracted with Holmes Foundry to supply American Motors with cylinder block castings. American Motors acquired 25% interest in the foundry in January 1966. In July 1970, American Motors acquired 100% of Holmes Foundry through an exchange of shares, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. However, it was not until October 1981 that Holmes Foundry finally became a Division of American Motors, Canada. As part of its acquisition of American Motors in 1987, Chrysler Corporation took ownership of the Holmes facility and its manufacturing business but closed the operation on September 16, 1988. The industrial facilities were cleaned of their environmental contaminants in 2005, in preparation for a new highway interchange to be built on the site. * Kenosha \\"Lakefront\\" (Kenosha, Wisconsin) Plant ‚Äì The American Motors plant in downtown Kenosha along Lake Michigan was razed, and after reclamation the land was used for new development. At the company's inception in 1954, the plant covered and together with the Milwaukee plant had an annual production capacity of 350,000 cars. * Milwaukee Body (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) Plant ‚Äì American Motors inherited a body plant in Milwaukee from Nash. The plant was the main body plant for Seaman Body Company, which did a lot of business with Nash and other makers assembling bodies of various designs. For American Motors, the plant was sometimes an internal headache. For instance, in late 1961, George Romney himself stormed through the plant and threatened to close it and eliminate its 9,000 jobs due to labor problems. The plant survived until the Chrysler buyout. Chrysler later decided to dispose of the factory. Upon closure, the site was named as a Superfund site. The factory was demolished and the site rehabilitated and redeveloped. * Danforth Ave (Toronto, Ontario) Plant ‚Äì Inherited from Nash. This plant was purchased by Nash from Ford of Canada in 1946. The first Canadian-built Nash rolled off the line in April 1950. Upon the formation of American Motors in 1954, the plant assembled 1955 Nash and Hudson Ramblers (2- and 4-door sedans); as well as Nash Canadian Statesman and Hudson Wasp (4 door sedans). In 1956, the plant continued to assemble Nash and Hudson Rambler (4-door sedans and wagons) and the Nash Canadian Statesman (4-door sedan); but The Hudson Wasp was imported. That same year, American Motors Sales (Canada) Limited was formed ‚Äì taking over Nash Motors of Canada Limited and Hudson Motors of Canada Limited. In 1957, American Motors assembled the Rambler Six and Rambler Rebel V8 at the Danforth plant; but in July 1957, American Motors closed the plant and imported Ramblers into Canada until 1961. The structure remains today as the Shoppers World Danforth Lowe's store. * Tilbury, Ontario Assembly Plant ‚Äì Another plant American Motors inherited from the 1954 merger; this one via Hudson. Specifically, it was a contract with CHATCO Steel Products which actually owned the plant. American Motors ceased Hudson production at the Tilbury plant in 1955. * Brampton Assembly Plant ‚Äì American Motors opened a plant in 1960 in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. It was part of American Motors Canada, Inc. Rambler Drive, a small street just west of this plant, still exists and leads into a residential subdivision that was built in the 1960s. In 1987, with the Chrysler buyout, the division and the plant were absorbed as well, becoming part of Chrysler Canada Limited. The plant was closed in 1994 and sold to Wal-Mart for use as their Canadian warehouse. This plant/warehouse was demolished in 2004 and redeveloped in 2007 with multiple smaller commercial buildings now onsite; a new Lowes Home Improvement Warehouse now takes up the largest section of this commercial development. Note that this is a separate facility from the current Brampton (formerly Bramalea) Assembly and Satellite Stamping Plants nearby. * South Charleston Stamping Plant ‚Äì A South Charleston, West Virginia, facility. While American Motors leased it, the plant stamped steel automotive parts. In 1978 Volkswagen of America purchased the plant. to supply stampings for its Westmoreland Assembly Plant, subsequently selling the plant when it closed Westmoreland in 1988 to Park Corporation of Cleveland, OH. In October 2006 its recent tenant, Union Stamping and Assembly, declared bankruptcy.  Earlier use of the name  The era of 1900 to 1925 saw various corporations, in several U.S. states, use similar \\"American\\" names, such as American Motor Carriage Company (Ohio, 1902‚Äì1903), American Automobile Manufacturing Company (Indiana, 1911‚Äì1912), and American Motors Incorporated (New York, 1919‚Äì1920). In 1916, an earlier \\"American Motors Corporation\\", apparently unrelated to the more famous later corporation of the same name, was formed in Newark, New Jersey, with Louis Chevrolet as vice president and chief engineer. By 1918 it was producing cars in a plant at Plainfield, New Jersey. In 1923 it merged with the Bessemer Motor Truck Company of Pennsylvania into Bessemer‚ÄìAmerican Motors Corporation, which lasted less than a year before merging with the Winther and Northway companies into Amalgamated Motors. The latter company apparently ceased soon after.  Later reuse of the trademark  A new company was formed in Palmdale, California, in 2001. Registration for the American Motors trademarks was filed in 2001 by this California-based firm. The company's website specifically claimed no affiliation to the previous American Motors but used American Motors's history and logos on its website. The website is now dead, and the company's claims to American Motors's trademarks expired in 2005. The new Chrysler LLC holds a live registration for the name \\"American Motors\\", which was applied for in 2005. The \\"AMC\\" wordmark, complete with \\"A-mark\\" graphic logo, as was originally used in 1970 and through the late-1980s ‚Äì was registered and published for comment by Chrysler as of 2010.

Major parts (block, crankshaft, head assembly) were initially purchased from Audi and shipped to the U.S. where final assembly was accomplished by American Motors at a plant purchased specifically for the production of this engine. Sales never reached numbers to justify taking over total production. American Motors made several changes to the engine. They were prevented from using the Volkswagen or Audi names in association with the American Motors assembled version by contractual agreement.  Collectibility  Javelin with \\"Go\\" package Ambassador hardtop wagon Rambler American convertible American Motors models historically regarded by hobbyists as particularly \\"collectible\\" include the Javelin, AMX, and performance specials such as the 1957 Rambler Rebel, 1965‚Äì67 Marlin, 1969 Hurst SC/Rambler, 1970 Rebel Machine, and 1971 Hornet SC/360. These models enjoyed limited popularity when new, resulting in low production figures. In January 2007, the AMC AMX was \\"really taking off in the muscle car market\\" according to the editors of Hemmings Classic Car, and it had \\"left its mark among AMC collectors' minds as a great alternative\\" to higher-priced Hemi- powered muscle cars. The early Javelin (1968‚Äì70) stands out from the Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler pony cars. Car expert Jack Nerad noted in a 2007 article \\"several fully restored AMX models\\" listed for sale at \\"little more than half the price of a comparable Buick Gran Sport, Chevrolet Chevelle, Olds 4-4-2 or Pontiac GTO\\" in support of the author's opinion that the 1971‚Äì74 Javelin was \\"clearly an outstanding alternative muscle car for the enthusiast on a budget.\\" According to James C. Mays, automotive historian and author of The Savvy Guide to Buying Collector Cars at Auction, the \\"Wow! Factor\\" is an important and measurable pleasure to an owner whether their car is driven or sits in a climate-controlled garage. His \\"Wow! Factor\\" includes examples of a bright red 1969 AMX that according to its owner \\"is just a fast Rambler\\", but draws more people at events than the more prestigious Ferraris and Lamborghinis, as well as a \\"million-dollar moment\\" when a Rambler owner was serenaded with the \\"Beep Beep\\" song by The Playmates while fueling at a travel plaza. Moreover, the author's collector car, a 1969 Ambassador station wagon, made friends as strangers came to greet and host him as if \\"long lost kin\\".Mays, pp. 37‚Äì38. Mays points out the ready availability of parts for American Motors engines and his experiences in having service done on Ramblers without being charged for the work in exchange for the experience of driving a \\"sassy Rambler\\" (a 1966 American convertible) and having pictures taken with it.Mays, pp. 39‚Äì40. Other American Motors models, once somewhat ignored by the hobby, are now considered \\"future collectibles\\". Examples include the 1959 Ambassador 4-door hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were produced, and the Jeep Scrambler CJ8, a combined pickup truck-Jeep, of which only a few thousand were produced. Hemmings Classic Car magazine included the 1969‚Äì70 Rebel SST and the 1974‚Äì78 Matador coupe in their 2008 list of \\"dollar-for- pound [weight]\\" cars that could be bought in show-quality condition for a comparatively modest outlay, The writer also noted that \\"most of AMC's '70s lineup\\" qualified for inclusion on the list. The AMC Gremlin is described to have \\"a cult-like following in today's collectible car market. The Gremlin shares components with some other American Motors models its repair and restoration can be relatively inexpensive compared with other \\"historic cars\\". The AMC Pacer increased in value according to a Pacer owner who is the CEO of a major insurance provider for collector car owners. There are active Rambler and American Motors car clubs in the U.S. and elsewhere (examples in External Links). = Hot Rod Magazine revival April Fool's joke = In April 2008, Hot Rod Magazine released an article claiming that American Motors was in the process of being revived. The vehicles in the works were to be the AMX, Matador, Ambassador, Pacer, and Gremlin. Illustrated with drawings of the concept cars entering production and accompanied by plentiful information, it was a popular article, although it was later revealed to be an April Fools' joke.

Established in 1902, Crater Lake is the fifth-oldest national park in the United States and the only national park in Oregon. The park encompasses the caldera of Crater Lake, a remnant of Mount Mazama, a destroyed volcano, and the surrounding hills and forests. The lake is deep at its deepest point,Bacon, Charles R.; James V. Gardner; Larry A. Mayer; Mark W. Buktenica; Peter Darnell; David W. Ramsey; Joel E. Robinson (June 2002). \\"Morphology, volcanism, and mass wasting in Crater Lake, Oregon\\". Geological Society of America Bulletin 114 (6): 675‚Äì692. doi:10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114<0675:MVAMWI>2.0.CO;2. ISSN 0016-7606. which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second-deepest in North America and the ninth-deepest in the world. Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh-deepest lake in the world, but this former listing excludes the approximately depth of subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica, which resides under nearly of ice, and the recent report of a maximum depth for Lake O'Higgins/San Martin, located on the border of Chile and Argentina. However, when comparing its average depth of to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third- deepest in the world. The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Range. The caldera rim ranges in elevation from . The United States Geological Survey benchmarked elevation of the lake surface is . The national park encompasses . Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage. The lake's water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is refilled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain. Geology Satellite view of Crater Lake Volcanic activity in this area is fed by subduction off the coast of Oregon as the Juan de Fuca Plate slips below the North American Plate (see plate tectonics). Heat and compression generated by this movement has created a mountain chain topped by a series of volcanoes, which together are called the Cascade Range. The large volcanoes in the range are called the High Cascades. However, there are many other volcanoes in the range as well, most of which are much smaller. About 400,000 years ago, Mount Mazama began its existence in much the same way as the other mountains of the High Cascades, as overlapping shield volcanoes. Over time, alternating layers of lava flows and pyroclastic flows built Mazama's overlapping cones until it reached about in height. Relief map of Crater Lake area As the young stratovolcano grew, many smaller volcanoes and volcanic vents were built in the area of the park and just outside what are now the park's borders. Chief among these were cinder cones. Although the early examples are gone‚Äîcinder cones erode easily‚Äîthere are at least 13 much younger cinder cones in the park, and at least another 11 or so outside its borders, that still retain their distinctive cinder cone appearance. There continues to be debate as to whether these minor volcanoes and vents were parasitic to Mazama's magma chamber and system or if they were related to background Oregon Cascade volcanism. After a period of dormancy, Mazama became active again. Then, around 5700 BC, Mazama collapsed into itself during a tremendous volcanic eruption, losing in height. The eruption formed a large caldera that, depending on the prevailing climate, was filled in about 740 years, forming a beautiful lake with a deep blue hue, known today as Crater Lake. The eruptive period that decapitated Mazama also laid waste to much of the greater Crater Lake area and deposited ash as far east as the northwest corner of what is now Yellowstone National Park, as far south as central Nevada, and as far north as southern British Columbia. It produced more than 150 times as much ash as the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. This ash has since developed a soil type called andisol. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown sandy loams or loamy sands which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.  Climate  Rim Village. During the winter, the road up to Rim Village is normally plowed but Rim Drive is closed. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Crater Lake National Park has a continental subarctic climate - Cold Dry Summer (Dsc). The plant hardiness zone at the lake is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . Snow is relatively rare at low elevations in western Oregon, but it is common at higher elevations, especially at Crater Lake. Measurements at park headquarters, above sea level, show that snow falls more often here than at any other long- term weather station in Oregon. Winter, which typically begins at the park in September and runs through June, includes an average of 98 days with measurable snowfall. Up to of snow have fallen on the park in a single day (in 1937, 1951, and 1971), in a month (January 1950), and in a year (1950).Taylor and Hannan, pp. 39‚Äì41 Snow typically accumulates in the park to depths of by early spring. Most of the park's roads remain closed through late spring, and snow lingers into the summer. In July and August, snowfall is uncommon, and \\"one magnificent day typically follows another\\". January is the coldest month, when highs average about and lows average about .Taylor and Hannan, p. 24 August is the warmest month, with an average high of roughly and an average low of about . Between 1962 and 1990, the highest recorded temperature was , and the lowest was .Taylor and Hannan, p. 118 Annual precipitation averages about a year.Taylor and Hannan, p. 11 December is the wettest, averaging about . Although snow covers Crater Lake National Park for eight months of the year (average annual snowfall is ), the lake rarely freezes over due in part to a relatively mild onshore flow from the Pacific Ocean. The last recorded year in which the lake froze over was in 1949, a very long, cold winter. A 95% surface freeze occurred in 1985. The immense depth of Crater Lake acts as a heat reservoir that absorbs and traps sunlight, maintaining the lake temperature at an average of on the surface and at the bottom throughout the year. The surface temperature fluctuates a bit, but the bottom temperature remains quite constant. Fauna Mammals that are residents of this national park are Canadian lynxes, bobcats, beavers, chipmunks, pronghorns, foxes, squirrels, porcupines, black bears, coyotes, pika, badgers, deer, elk, muskrats, and martens. Birds that commonly fly through this park including raptors are American dippers, Peregrine falcons, ravens, Clark's nutcrackers, Canada jays, bald eagles, hummingbirds and spotted owls while Canada geese float on its lake. Park features Comfort Station Number 4 The Pinnacles Some notable park features created by this huge eruption are: * The Pumice Desert: A very thick layer of pumice and ash leading away from Mazama in a northerly direction. Even after thousands of years, this area is largely devoid of plants due to excessive porosity (meaning water drains through quickly) and poor soil composed primarily of regolith. * The Pinnacles: When the very hot ash and pumice came to rest near the volcano, it formed gas-charged deposits. For perhaps years afterward, hot gas moved to the surface and slowly cemented ash and pumice together in channels and escaped through fumaroles. Erosion later removed most of the surrounding loose ash and pumice, leaving tall pinnacles and spires. ;Other park features: * Mount Scott is a steep andesitic cone whose lava came from magma from Mazama's magma chamber; geologists call such volcano a parasitic or satellite cone. Volcanic eruptions apparently ceased on Scott sometime before the end of the Pleistocene; one remaining large cirque on Scott's northwest side was left unmodified by post-ice-age volcanism. * In the southwest corner of the park stands Union Peak, an extinct volcano whose primary remains consist of a large volcanic plug, which is lava that solidified in the volcano's neck. * Crater Peak is a shield volcano primarily made of andesite and basalt lava flows topped by andesitic and dacite tephra. * Timber Crater is a shield volcano located in the northeast corner of the park. Like Crater Peak, it is made of basaltic and andesitic lava flows but, unlike Crater, it is topped by two cinder cones. * Rim Drive is the most popular road in the park; it follows a scenic route around the caldera rim. * Llao Rock on the north side rises above the lake, with a trail from Rim Drive leading to the summit. * The Pacific Crest Trail, a long- distance hiking and equestrian trail that stretches from the Mexican to Canadian borders, passes through the park. * Old-growth forests covering . History Aerial view of Crater Lake Local Native Americans witnessed the collapse of Mount Mazama and kept the event alive in their legends. One ancient legend of the Klamath people closely parallels the geologic story which emerges from today's scientific research. The legend tells of two Chiefs, Llao of the Below World and Skell of the Above World, pitted in a battle which ended up in the destruction of Llao's home, Mt. Mazama. The battle was witnessed in the eruption of Mt. Mazama and the creation of Crater Lake. A trio of gold prospectors‚ÄîJohn Wesley Hillman, Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters‚Äîwere the first white people to visit the lake. On June 12, 1853, they stumbled upon the long, sloping mountain while hunting for provisions. Stunned by vibrant blue color of the lake, they named the indigo body of water \\"Deep Blue Lake\\" and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as Discovery Point. But gold was more on the minds of settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten. The suggested name later fell out of favor by locals, who preferred the name \\"Crater Lake.\\" William Gladstone Steel devoted his life and fortune to the establishment and management of a national park at Crater Lake. His preoccupation with the lake began in 1870. In his efforts to bring recognition to the park, he participated in lake surveys that provided scientific support. He named many of the lake's landmarks, including Wizard Island, Llao Rock, and Skell Head. With the help of geologist Clarence Dutton, Steel organized a USGS expedition to study the lake in 1886. The party carried the Cleetwood, a half-ton survey boat, up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake. From the stern of the Cleetwood, a piece of pipe on the end of a spool of piano wire sounded the depth of the lake at 168 different points. Their deepest sounding, , was very close to the modern official depth of made in 2000 by sonar. At the same time, a topographer surveyed the area and created the first professional map of the Crater Lake area. Crater Lake Lodge Partly based on data from the expedition and lobbying from Steel and others, Crater Lake National Park was established May 22, 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt. And because of Steel's involvement, Crater Lake Lodge was opened in 1915 and the Rim Drive was completed in 1918. Highways were later built to the park to help facilitate tourism. The 1929 edition of O Ranger! described access and facilities available by then: > Crater Lake National Park is reached by train on the Southern Pacific > Railroad lines into Medford and Klamath Falls, at which stops motor stages > make the short trip to the park. A hotel on the rim of the lake offers > accommodations. For the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip > from the Pacific and Dalles-California highways. He will find, in addition > to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. The park is open to > travel from late June or July 1 for as long as snow does not block the > roads, generally until October. The lake is described in the poetry of Joaquin Miller. Activities Daily Trips (1931) There are many hiking trails and several campgrounds inside the park. Unlicensed fishing is allowed without any limitation of size, species, or number. The lake is believed to have no indigenous fish, but several species of fish were introduced beginning in 1888 until all fish stocking ended in 1941. Kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) now thrive and reproduce here naturally. Swimming is allowed in the lake, and the boat tours, which stop at Wizard Island, a cinder cone inside the lake, operate daily during the summer. All lake access for people is from Cleetwood Trail, a steep walking trail, and there are no roads for cars, trucks, or wagons that lead to the waterfront. All of the boats in the lake were delivered by helicopter. Numerous observation points along the caldera rim for the lake are readily accessible by automobile via the Rim Drive, which is long and has an elevation gain of . The highest point in Crater Lake National Park is Mount Scott at . Getting there requires a fairly steep hike from the Rim Drive trailhead. On a clear day, visibility from the summit exceeds , and one can, in a single view, take in the entire caldera. Also visible from this point are the white-peaked Cascade Range volcanoes to the north, the Columbia River Plateau to the east, and the Western Cascades and the more-distant Klamath Mountains to the west. The scenery of Crater Lake is fully accessible during the summer months. Heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall, winter, and spring months force many road and trail closures, including the popular Rim Drive, which is generally completely open from July to October and partially open in some other months, such as May, June, and November.  Trails  View up to Watchman Trail and peak Garfield Peak trail, view east towards Crater Lake = Cleetwood Cove = The Cleetwood Cove trail originates on the north side of the lake about east of North Junction along East Rim Drive. The trail is the only one that accesses the shoreline of the lake, descending from the Cleetwood Cove parking lot. First opened during the summer of 1960, the trail is long with an 11% grade that rates it as a strenuous route on the return trip. Due to its steep grade, the trail is not accessible for mobility-impaired visitors. A dock with concessionaire boats facilitates tours around the lake with a stop at Wizard Island for dropping off and picking up passengers. Swimming and fishing are permitted. Snow may cover the trail from October to July with some variance depending on yearly snowfall conditions. = The Watchman = The Watchman Peak trail begins from the Watchman Overlook parking lot, about northwest of Rim Village. The trail is long with a elevation change. It is a steady uphill trail on an isolated mountain on the west rim of the crater, with several switchbacks, providing wide views of Crater Lake and Wizard Island. Several nearby landmarks are visible from the summit, including Mount McLoughlin, Mount Thielsen, Union Peak, Mount Scott and the Klamath Basin. The trail ends next to a historic fire lookout tower built in 1932. = Lightning Spring = The Lightning Spring trail starts from the Lightning Spring picnic area. It is a hike with an elevation gain of . The trail circles around several meadows up to the Lightning Spring creek. The trail is known for the frequent sights of grazing deer. = Castle Crest Wildflower Garden = This is considered to be the easiest trail, looping around the Castle Crest Wildflower Garden. It starts from the East Rim Road, near the park's headquarters. It received its name because of a large stretch of meadows around which the trail circles and which is bursting with wildflowers in the springtime. The trail is about before it reaches the wildflower meadow garden, from which other improvised routes depart. = Plaikni Falls = The Plaikni Falls trail is the newest trail on the Crater Lake park. It stretches from the trailhead located south from the Phantom Ship Overlook on Pinnacles Road, which spins off Rim Drive. The trail leads to Plaikni Falls. Most of the trail is wheelchair-accessible. The final stretch is fairly uphill, which may prove moderately challenging. = Garfield Peak = Phantom Ship The Garfield Peak trail is a moderately challenging hike to Garfield Peak. The trailhead is located east of the Crater Lake Lodge and gains approximately of elevation. Several spots along the trail provide viewpoints overlooking the Phantom Ship island and Dutton Cliff. A few viewpoints offer unique views of Wizard island. The trail is popular in the late afternoon on account of unique shifting colors over the lake and its surroundings.

The Aichi D3A Type 99 Carrier Bomber (Allied reporting name \\"Val\\")Note: This code name was applied mid-to- late 1943; more often the D3A was referred to as the \\"Type 99 navy dive bomber\\" by Allied forces. is a World War II carrier-borne dive bomber. It was the primary dive bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and was involved in almost all IJN actions, including the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Aichi D3A was the first Japanese aircraft to bomb American targets in the war, commencing with Pearl Harbor and U.S. bases in the Philippines, such as Clark Air Force Base. They sank more Allied warships than any other Axis aircraft.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 142.Worth 2001, p. 170.Casey 1977, p. 87. Design and development In mid-1936, the Japanese Navy issued the 11-Shi specification for a monoplane carrier-based dive bomber to replace the existing D1A biplane then in service. Aichi, Nakajima, and Mitsubishi all submitted designs, with the former two subsequently being asked for two prototypes each. The Aichi design started with low-mounted elliptical wings inspired by the Heinkel He 70 Blitz. It flew slowly enough that the drag from the landing gear was not a serious issue, so fixed gear was used for simplicity.Francillon 1979, p. 272. The aircraft was to be powered by the Nakajima Hikari 1 nine-cylinder radial engine. The first prototype was completed in December 1937, and flight trials began a month later. Initial tests were disappointing. The aircraft was underpowered and suffered from directional instability in wide turns, and in tighter turns it tended to snap roll. The dive brakes vibrated heavily when extended at their design speed of , and the Navy was already asking for a faster diving speed of .Francillon 1979, pp. 272‚Äì273. The second aircraft was extensively modified before delivery to try to address the problems. Power was increased by replacing the Hikari with the Mitsubishi Kinsei 3 in a redesigned cowling, and the vertical tail was enlarged to help with the directional instability. The wings were slightly larger in span and the outer sections of the leading edges had wash- out to combat the snap rolls, and strengthened dive brakes were fitted. These changes cured all of the problems except the directional instability, and it was enough for the D3A1 to win over the Nakajima D3N1.Francillon 1969, p. 24. In December 1939, the Navy ordered the aircraft as the Navy Type 99 Carrier Bomber Model 11 (kanj≈ç bakugekiki, usually abbreviated to Ëâ¶ÁàÜ kanbaku.Parshall and Tully 2007, p. 80.). The production models featured slightly smaller wings and increased power in the form of the Kinsei 43 or Kinsei 44. The directional instability problem was finally cured with the fitting of a long dorsal fin- strake which started midway down the rear fuselage, and the aircraft actually became highly maneuverable.Air International December 1987, p. 289. Equipment The pilot position was equipped with a Type 95 telescopic gunsight in the earlier models and a Type 99 in the later models, which were used for aiming the bomb during the dive. The observer/navigator position was equipped with a Type 97 Mk1 drift sight, which was a long vertical tube located in the front-left of the observer's seat. In addition, the observer position was equipped with a drift meter that was mounted on the floor in the front-right of the observer's seat. The observer also operated a Type 96 Mk2 radio set that was mounted in front of the observer's seat and behind the pilot's seat. On top of the radio set was a Type 3 reflector compass for precise navigation.Mikesh (2004) Armament was two fixed forward-firing Type 97 machine guns, and one flexible 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 92 machine gun at the rear end of cockpit, which was operated by the observer. Normal bomb load was a single 250 kg bomb (e.g., Type 99 No 25 semi-AP or Type 98 No 25 land bomb) carried under the fuselage, swung out under the propeller on release by a trapeze. Two additional 60 kg bombs (e.g., Type 99 No 6 semi-AP or Type 2 No 6 land bomb) could be carried on wing racks located under each wing outboard of the dive brakes.Air International December 1987, p. 288. Operational history An individual D3A dive bomber was commanded by the senior ranking crew member aboard, which could be the observer rather than the pilot. This was in contrast to US Navy, where the pilot was almost always the commander of a dive bomber. For example, Petty Officer First Class Kiyoto Furuta was serving as a pilot to Lieutenant Takehiko Chihaya during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and later on to Lieutenant Keiichi Arima during the two carrier battles of the Solomon Islands campaign, both of whom were observers. The D3A1 commenced carrier qualification trials aboard the aircraft carriers and during 1940, while a small number of aircraft made their combat debut from land bases over China. Starting with the attack on Pearl Harbor, the D3A1 took part in all major Japanese carrier operations in the first 10 months of the war. They achieved their first major success against the Royal Navy during their Indian Ocean raid in April 1942. D3A1 dive bombers scored over 80% hitsFrancillon 1979, p. 274. with their bombs during attacks on two heavy cruisers and an aircraft carrier during the operation. Before Indian Ocean raid, the established doctrine regarding attack against ships was to arm all D3A dive bombers with semi-AP bombs. On 5 April 1942, IJN carrier force attacked Colombo on Ceylon with half of its complement, while the other half was kept in reserve for strikes against ships. Since a second strike against Colombo was deemed necessary, the dive bombers of reserve force were rearmed from semi-AP bombs to land bombs. When British heavy cruisers were spotted soon afterwards, the reserve force was sent with a portion of D3A dive bombers armed with land bombs. In the subsequent attack, land bombs unintentionally proved very effective in suppressing the anti-aircraft fire from the ships. As a result, the doctrine was modified in order to intentionally equip the first few D3A dive bombers with land bombs. This new method was already implemented for the attack that sunk just four days later, and continued to be used from then on. During 1942, dive bombing attacks by D3A bombers significantly contributed to sinking of three US fleet carriers: Lexington at the Battle of the Coral Sea, Yorktown at the Battle of Midway and Hornet at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. In addition, they damaged carrier Enterprise both at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. During the course of the war, D3A dive bombers often combined their attacks upon enemy warships with the IJN Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bomber; consequently enemy vessels were often sunk by a combination strike of bombs and torpedoes. However, there were occasions when just the D3A's would make the attacks, or at least score the sinking hits. Discounting the Pearl Harbor strike, which also used the B5N for level bombing and torpedo attacks, D3A dive bombers were credited with sinking the following Allied warships:Brown 1990, pp. 60‚Äì125. *, American destroyer, 19 February 1942 ‚Äì Australia (Darwin)Roscoe 1953, p. 96 *, American destroyer, 1 March 1942 ‚Äì Java Sea *, American destroyer, 1 March 1942- Indian Ocean *, American oiler, 1 March 1942- Indian Ocean *, British heavy cruiser, 5 April 1942 ‚Äì Indian Ocean *, British heavy cruiser, 5 April 1942 ‚Äì Indian Ocean *, British armed merchant cruiser, 5 April 1942 ‚Äì Indian Ocean *, British destroyer, 5 April 1942 ‚Äì Indian Ocean *, British aircraft carrier, 9 April 1942 ‚Äì Indian Ocean *, Australian destroyer, 9 April 1942 ‚Äì Indian Ocean *, American destroyer, 7 May 1942 ‚Äì Pacific Ocean *, American destroyer, 1 February 1943 ‚Äì Pacific Ocean (Ironbottom Sound) *, American destroyer, 7 April 1943 ‚Äì Pacific Ocean (Ironbottom Sound) *, American destroyer, 26 December 1943 ‚Äì Pacific OceanParkin 1995, p. 198. *, American destroyer, sunk by kamikaze 1 November 1944 ‚Äì Pacific OceanParkin 1995, p. 251. *, American destroyer, sunk by kamikaze 10 June 1945 ‚Äì Japan (Okinawa) As the war progressed, there were instances when the dive bombers were pressed into duty as fighters in the interceptor role, their maneuverability being enough to allow them to survive in this role.Francillon 1969, p. 25. In June 1942, an improved version of the D3A powered by a Kinsei 54 was tested as the Model 12. The extra power reduced range, so the design was further modified with additional fuel tanks to bring the total tankage to , giving it the range needed to fight effectively over the Solomon Islands. Known to the Navy as the Model 22, it began to replace the Model 11 in front-line units in autumn 1942, and most Model 11s were then sent to training units. When the Yokosuka D4Y Suisei became available, the D3A2s ended up with land-based units or operating from the smaller carriers, which were too small to handle the fast-landing Suisei. When American forces recaptured the Philippines in 1944, land-based D3A2s took part in the fighting, but were hopelessly outdated and losses were heavy. By then, many D3A1s and D3A2s were operated by training units in Japan, and several were modified with dual controls as Navy Type 99 Bomber Trainer Model 12s (D3A2-K). During the last year of the war, the D3A2s were pressed back into combat for kamikaze missions.Air International December 1987, p. 290.

The house originated in 1635 as a cadet branch of the House of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, growing in prestige until Hanover became an Electorate in 1692. George I became the first Hanoverian monarch of Great Britain and Ireland in 1714. At Victoria's death in 1901, the throne of the United Kingdom passed to her eldest son Edward VII, a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The last reigning members of the House lost the Duchy of Brunswick in 1918 when Germany became a republic. The formal name of the house was the House of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, Hanover line. The senior line of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, which ruled Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, became extinct in 1884. The House of Hanover is now the only surviving branch of the House of Welf, which is the senior branch of the House of Este. The current head of the House of Hanover is Ernst August, Prince of Hanover. History =Dukes and Electors of Brunswick-L√ºneburg= George, Duke of Brunswick- L√ºneburg, is considered the first member of the House of Hanover. When the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg was divided in 1635, George inherited the Principality of Calenberg and moved his residence to Hanover. His son, Christian Louis, inherited the Principality of L√ºneburg from George's brother. Calenberg and L√ºneburg were then shared between George's sons until united in 1705 under his grandson, also called George, who subsequently became George I of Great Britain. All held the title Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. George died in 1641 and was succeeded by: *Christian Louis, 1st son of Duke George, Prince of Calenberg (1641‚Äì1648) and Prince of L√ºneburg (1648‚Äì1665). He relinquished Calenburg when he became Prince of L√ºneburg. *George William, 2nd son of Duke George, Prince of Calenberg (1648‚Äì1665) and Prince of L√ºneburg (1665‚Äì1705). He relinquished Calenburg when he became Prince of L√ºneburg on the death of his brother, Christian Louis. *John Frederick, 3rd son of Duke George, Prince of Calenberg (1665‚Äì1679). *Ernest Augustus, 4th son of Duke George, Prince of Calenberg (1679‚Äì1698). He became Prince of Calenberg on the death of his brother John Frederick. He was elevated to prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. Ernest Augustus's wife, Sophia of the Palatinate, was declared heiress of the throne of England by the Act of Settlement of 1701, which decreed Roman Catholics could not accede to the throne. Sophia was at that time the senior eligible Protestant descendant of James I of England. *George Louis, son of Duke Ernest Augustus and Sophia, became Elector and Prince of Calenberg in 1698 and Prince of L√ºneburg when his uncle George William died in 1705. He inherited his mother's claim to the throne of Great Britain when she died in 1714. =Monarchs of Great Britain, Ireland, and Hanover= George Louis became the first British monarch of the House of Hanover as George I in 1714.. The dynasty provided six British monarchs: Of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland: *George I ( 1714‚Äì1727) (Georg Ludwig = George Louis) *George II ( 1727‚Äì1760) (Georg August = George Augustus) *George III ( 1760‚Äì1801)In 1801, the British and Irish kingdoms merged, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland: *George III ( 1801‚Äì1820) *George IV ( 1820‚Äì1830) *William IV ( 1830‚Äì1837) *Victoria ( 1837‚Äì1901). George I, George II, and George III also served as electors and dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, informally, Electors of Hanover (cf. personal union). From 1814, when Hanover became a kingdom, the British monarch was also King of Hanover.

Succession to the Hanoverian throne was regulated by semi-Salic law (agnatic-cognatic), which gave priority to all male lines before female lines, so that it passed not to Queen Victoria but to her uncle, the Duke of Cumberland. In 1901, when Queen Victoria, the last British monarch provided by the House of Hanover, died, her son and heir Edward VII became the first British Monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Edward taking his family name from that of his father, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

The 1866 rift between the House of Hanover and the House of Hohenzollern was settled only by the 1913 marriage of Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia to Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, the last king's grandson. =Prince-bishops of Osnabr√ºck= At the end of the Thirty Years' War, the Peace of Westphalia (1648) awarded the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr√ºck alternately to a Catholic bishop and to a cadet branch of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Since the treaty gave cadets priority over heirs and reigning princes, Osnabr√ºck became a form of appanage (in alternation) of the House of Hanover. * Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (r. 1662‚Äì1698), fourth son of George, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg * Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany (r. 1715‚Äì1728), sixth son of Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L√ºneburg * Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (r. 1764‚Äì1802), second son of George III Osnabr√ºck was mediatized to Hanover in 1803. =Dukes of Brunswick= In 1884, the senior branch of the House of Welf became extinct. By semi-Salic law, the House of Hanover would have acceded to the Duchy of Brunswick, but there had been strong Prussian pressure against having George V of Hanover or his son, the Duke of Cumberland, succeed to a member state of the German Empire, at least without strong conditions, including swearing to the German constitution. By a law of 1879, the Duchy of Brunswick established a temporary council of regency to take over at the Duke's death, and if necessary appoint a regent. The Duke of Cumberland proclaimed himself Duke of Brunswick at the Duke's death, and lengthy negotiations ensued, but were never resolved. Prince Albert of Prussia was appointed regent; after his death in 1906, Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg succeeded him. The Duke of Cumberland's eldest son died in a car accident in 1912; the father renounced Brunswick in favor of his younger son Ernest Augustus, who married the Kaiser's daughter Victoria Louise the same year, swore allegiance to the German Empire, and was allowed to ascend the throne of the Duchy in November 1913. He was a major-general during the First World War; but he was overthrown as Duke of Brunswick in 1918. His father was also deprived of his British titles in 1919, for \\"bearing arms against Great Britain\\". After having left Brunswick Palace, the duke and his family moved back to their exile seat Cumberland Castle at Gmunden, Austria, but in 1924 he received Blankenburg Castle and some other estates in a settlement with the Free State of Brunswick, and moved there in 1930. A few days before Blankenburg was handed over to the Red Army by British and US forces in late 1945, to become part of East Germany, the family was able to quickly move to Marienburg Castle (Hanover) with all their furniture, transported by British army trucks, on the order of King George VI. Duke Ernest Augustus died at Marienburg Castle in 1953. His Herrenhausen Palace in Hanover had been completely destroyed during World War II. His eldest son, Prince Ernest Augustus, sold his remaining property at Herrenhausen Gardens in 1961, but kept the nearby Princely House, a small palace built in 1720 by George I for his daughter Anna Louise. It is now his grandson Ernest Augustus's private home, along with Marienburg Castle. File:Braunschweiger Schloss.jpgBrunswick Palace File:Wolfenbuettel Schloss (2006).jpgWolfenb√ºttel Castle =Claimants= Flag of the House of Hanover The later heads of the House of Hanover have been: * George V (1866‚Äì1878) * Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale (1878‚Äì1923) * Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick (1923‚Äì1953), son of the previous * Ernest Augustus, Prince of Hanover (1953‚Äì1987) * Ernest Augustus, Prince of Hanover (1987‚Äìpresent) ** Ernest Augustus, Hereditary Prince of Hanover (heir apparent) The family has been resident in Austria since 1866 and thus took on Austrian nationality besides their German and British. Since the later king Ernest Augustus had been created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh by his father George III in 1799, these British peerages were inherited by his descendants. In 1914 the title of a Prince of Great Britain and Ireland was additionally granted to the members of the house by King George V. These peerages and titles however were suspended under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917.Privately however the British Royal Family (of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, alias House of Windsor) continued to call their German branch the Cumberlands, for instance when Edward VIII described his visit to the family in Gmunden in a letter to his mother in 1937. However, the title Royal Prince of Great Britain and Ireland had been entered into the family's German passports, together with the German titles, in 1914. After the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, with the abolishment of nobility's privileges,In 1919 royalty and nobility lost their privileges as such in Germany, hereditary titles thereafter being legally retained only as part of the surname, according to Article 109 the Weimar Constitution. titles officially became parts of the last name. So, curiously, the British prince's title is still part of the family's last name in their German passports, while it is no longer mentioned in their British documents. On 29 August 1931, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, as head of the House of Hanover, declared the formal resumption, for himself and his dynastic descendants, of use of his former British princely title as a secondary title of pretense, which style, \\"Royal Prince of Great Britain and Ireland\\", his grandson, the current head of the house, also called Ernest Augustus, continues to claim.Ernst August (geb.1954) Prinz von Hannover at welfen.de (German) He has the right to petition under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 for the restoration of his ancestors' suspended British peerages Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh, but he has not done so.

Following a preparatory course in Brussels, Belgium, she passed her baccalaur√©at exam in the summer of 2003.Gage, Nicholas: \\"The Last Onassis.\\" Vanity Fair, Issue 537.

In 2016, the couple legally separated, following Miranda's alleged infidelity.http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/05/25/estilo/1464165250_537941.html Divorce negotiations began almost immediately, with Onassis hiring high- profile divorce lawyer Robert Stephan Cohen. The divorce caused complicated legal issues in the courts of Antwerp, Belgium, where Onassis had been living. Miranda challenged the prenuptial agreement and demanded alimony payments, and there were custody disputes over jointly owned horses. The divorce was finally settled in November 2017. Wealth Athina Onassis is the sole heiress of Christina Onassis, who inherited 55% of Aristotle Onassis's fortune. The remaining 45% of Aristotle's fortune (minus $26 million settled upon Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis) was left to the Alexander S. Onassis Foundation, established in honor of Alexander Onassis, Athina's late uncle, who had died in 1973. When Athina Onassis was seven years old, The New York Times cited a report from the Associated Press, naming Onassis one of the year's new billionaires, and even though she is often credited as a \\"billionaire heiress\\" throughout the media, the true extent of her wealth remains unknown. There have been several estimates of her inheritance, including the island of Skorpios, which was later sold to trusts connected with Ekaterina Rybolovleva, with some accounts claiming that Onassis's net worth is less than $1 billion. =Disputes over Onassis estate= Onassis's mother Christina never trusted Thierry Roussel completely, which led the family to arrange for a board of administrators to control the family's money until Athina came of age. The trustees Christina selected to manage the estate were Stelio Papadimitriou, Paul Ioannidis, Apostolos Zabelas, and Theodore Gabrielides.Stelio Papadimitriou's obituary During Athina's childhood and adolescence, all expenditures made on her behalf by her father (using money from the inheritance) had to be approved by the board, which led to her father threatening to move back to France, where the estate would have had to pay much higher income tax. In 1999, a Vaduz court ordered the management of Athina's inheritance to be transferred to the KPMG Fides auditing firm in Lucerne, Switzerland. At that time, aged 13, Onassis stated that she felt \\"great aversion to anything Greek\\". In one of her few interviews, published in Oggi, an Italian magazine, she later stated that she blamed \\"all the problems\\" on the Onassis name. Similarly, her stepmother, Gaby Landhage, stated on 20/20, an American television show, that Athina had told her \\"if she could burn all the Onassis money, she would do it.\\"\\"Hostage to fortune\\"; smh.com; January 25, 2003 On her 18th birthday, Athina took control of her mother's inheritance.

Sources  A sugar maple tree Three species of maple trees are predominantly used to produce maple sugar: the sugar maple (Acer saccharum), the black maple (A. nigrum), and the red maple (A. rubrum), because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, the sugar maple, by some botanists. Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavour of the sap. A few other (but not all) species of maple (Acer) are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple sugar, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum). Similar sugars may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources. Preparation Maple sugar is what remains after the sap of the sugar maple is boiled for longer than is needed to create maple syrup or maple taffy. Once almost all the water has been boiled off, all that is left is a solid sugar. By composition, this sugar is about 90% sucrose, the remainder consisting of variable amounts of glucose and fructose. This is usually sold in pressed blocks or as a translucent candy. It is difficult to create as the sugar easily burns and thus requires considerable skill. Regulation for product labeling In Canada, maple sugar is one of several maple products manufactured from maple sap or maple syrup, including maple butter and maple taffy. Under the Food and Drugs Act and Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, Canadian regulations require that maple sugar products identify the business identity and country of origin on the retail product label. History Maple sugar was the preferred form of maple by First Nations/American Indian peoples as the sugar could easily be transported and lasted a long time. It is called ziinzibaakwad by the Anishinaabeg.Weshki- Ayaad, Lippert and Gambill. Ojibwe-English and English-Ojibwe online dictionary . Blessing of the Bay, the second ocean-going merchant ship built in the English colonies, carried maple sugar from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to New Amsterdam as early as 1631. French awareness of the process is indicated in at least one engraver's works, those of the mid-18th-century artist Jean-Francois Turpin, the engraver Bernard (including several for Diderot's 1755 Encyclopedie.) and others.

When it is a savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, and then it can be served with a sauce such as ketchup or mayonnaise. History The earliest known reference to French toast is in the Apicius, a collection of Latin recipes dating to the 4th or 5th century, where it is described as simply aliter dulcia (\\"another sweet dish\\").Joseph Dommers Vehling, trans., Apicius: Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome, Book VII, chapter 13, recipe 296 full text at Gutenberg The recipe says to \\"Break [slice] fine white bread, crust removed, into rather large pieces which soak in milk [and beaten eggs] fry in oil, cover with honey and serve\\". A 14th-century German recipe uses the name Arme Ritter (\\"poor knights\\"), a name also used in English and the Nordic languages. Also in the 14th-century, Taillevent presented a recipe for \\"tost√©es dor√©es\\". Italian 15th-century culinary expert Martino da Como offers a recipe.Odile Redon, et al., The Medieval Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy, 2000, p. 207f The usual French name is pain perdu (, \\"lost bread\\", reflecting its use of stale or otherwise \\"lost\\" bread ‚Äî which gave birth to the metaphoric term pain perdu for sunk costs.Gabriel Meurier, Christoffel Plantijn, Vocabulaire francois- flameng, 1562 p. 83 It may also be called pain dor√©, \\"golden bread\\", in Canada.Tr√©sor de la Langue Fran√ßaise Informatis√© s.v. pain There are fifteenth-century English recipes for pain perdu.Austin, T.

In Hungary, it is commonly called bund√°skeny√©r (lit. \\"furry bread\\"). Preparation French toast topped with fruit, butter and cream, served with maple syrup. Slices of bread are soaked or dipped in a mixture of beaten eggs, often whisked with milk or cream. Sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla may be variously added to the mixture. The bread is then fried in butter or olive oil until browned and cooked through. Day-old bread is often used, both for its thrift and because it will soak up more egg mixture without falling apart. The cooked slices may be served with sugar or sweet toppings such as jam, honey, fruit, or maple syrup. =Variations= According to the Compleat Cook (1659) as quoted in the OED, the bread was dipped in milk only, with the egg mixture added afterwards.[Compleat Cook (1659) as quoted in the OED Citation incomplete, needs improvement] Alternatively, the bread may be soaked in wine, rosewater, or orange juice, either before or after cooking.John Ayto, The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink, , p. 142Adam Islip, A Dictionarie [sic] of the French and English Tongues, 1611, full text International versions =Portugal and Brazil= In both Portugal and Brazil, rabanadas are a traditional Christmas dessert.Rabanada, um antigo cl√°ssico natalino presente em todo o mundo (in Portuguese) =Algeria= In Algeria, pin doray. =France= In France, pain perdu has a wide range of regional variations. =Qu√©bec= In Qu√©bec, pain dor√©.

It is usually made by soaking stale bread in milk or wine with honey and spices. It is dipped in beaten egg and fried with olive oil. This cooking technique breaks down the fibres of the bread and results in a pastry with a crispy outside and smooth inside. It is often sprinkled with cinnamon as a final touch. Torrijas or torrejas were first mentioned by the Spanish composer, poet and playwright Juan del Encina (1468‚Äì1533) in his Cancionero, published in 1496. \\"Anda ac√° pastor\\" has the verse \\"En cantares nuevos/ gocen sus orejas,/ miel y muchos huevos/ para hacer torrejas,/ aunque sin dolor/ pari√≥ al Redentor\\". =Hong Kong= Hong Kong-style French toast Hong Kong-style French toast () is typically prepared by combining multiple slices of bread with peanut butter or fruit jam filling, then dipping in beaten egg and deep frying. It is served with butter, and topped with golden syrup or honey. It is a typical offering in Hong Kong teahouses (cha chaan teng).CNN Go World's 50 most delicious foods 21 July 2011.

After his 1760s move to the Ohio Country, he became affiliated with the Mingo, a tribe formed from Seneca, Cayuga, Lenape and other remnant peoples. He took revenge for family members killed by Virginian Long knives in 1774 in what is known as the Yellow Creek Massacre. His actions against settlers on the frontier helped spark Dunmore's War later that year. Logan became known for a speech, later known as Logan's Lament, which he reportedly delivered after the war. Scholars dispute important details about Logan, including his original name and whether the words of Logan's Lament were his. Identity debate Scholars agree that Logan Elrod was a son of Chief Shikellamy, an important diplomat for the Iroquois Confederacy. But, as anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace has written, \\"Which of Shikellamy's sons was Logan the orator has been a matter of dispute.\\"Wallace, Jefferson and the Indians, 343. Logan the orator has been variously identified as Tah-gah-jute, Tachnechdorus (also spelled \\"Tachnedorus\\" and \\"Taghneghdoarus\\"), Soyechtowa, Tocanioadorogon, the \\"Great Mingo\\" , James Logan, and John Logan. The name \\"Tah-gah-jute\\" was popularized in an 1851 book by Brantz Mayer entitled Tah- gah-jute: or Logan and Cresap. However, historian Francis Jennings wrote that Mayer's book was \\"erroneous from the first word of the title.\\" He identified Logan as James Logan, also known as Soyechtowa and Tocanioadorogon.Jennings, \\"James Logan\\". Historians who agree that Logan the orator was not named \\"Tah- gah-jute\\" sometimes identify him as Tachnechdorus. But Jennings identifies Tachnechdorus as Logan the orator's older brother. Oneida Chief Shikellamy Logan's father Chief Shikellamy, who was Oneida, worked closely with Pennsylvania official James Logan to maintain the Covenant Chain relationship with the colony of Pennsylvania. Following a prevailing Native American practice, the young man who would become Logan the Mingo took the name \\"James Logan\\" out of admiration for his father's friend. With the disruption of warfare, disease, and encroachment, some Seneca and Cayuga among the Iroquois migrated to the Ohio Country, as did Lenape. Joining together in a process of ethnogenesis, they became known as the Mingo tribe. Logan the Mingo is usually identified as a Mingo \\"chief\\", but historian Richard White has written that \\"He was not a chief. Kayashuta and White Mingo were the Mingo chiefs. Logan was merely a war leader. ... \\"White, Middle Ground, 358. The Iroquois and other Native American tribes tended to have peace chiefs and war chiefs, or leaders. Like his father, Logan generally maintained friendly relationships with white settlers who were moving from eastern Pennsylvania and Virginia into the Ohio Country: the region that is now Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and western Pennsylvania. Biography =Early life and family= John Logan's Father was the Iroquois Chief, Shikellamy of the Oneida Tribe. His mother was Neanoma a Cayuga. Shikellamy and Neanoma were married in New York State. A historical marker in Danby, New York, designates the \\"possible birthplace of Chief Logan (Tah-Gah-Jute),\\" and then quotes Logan's famous speech (see https://www.hmdb.org/results.asp?SearchFor=%22cayuga+indian+village%22). John Logan was also known as Tachnechtoris, \\"The Spreading Oak\\" or John Shikellamy. He had 3 known brothers and one sister. John was the oldest of the siblings. His next brother was. known as Tah-gah-jute, Sayughtowa, \\"The Beetling Brow\\", or James Logan. James later in life was referred to as \\"Logan, the Mingo.\\" His brother, Arahhot or \\"Unhappy Jake\\" was killed in the war with the Catawbas in 1744. John Petty or Sogogeghyata, was the youngest of his brothers and bore the name of a Shamokin Indian Trader.Hanna, The Wilderness Trail, i. p. 197 John Logan's sister was known as the widow of Cajadies who was known as \\"the best hunter among all of the Indians\\" who died in November 1747. Children, by tradition, took the clan or tribe of the mother. The Shikellamy children were of the Cayuga Tribe. Statement of Jesse Logan, aged 106 years old and Great Grandson of Chief Shikellamy Cornplanter Reservation, Penn October 9, 1915 \\"I was born on the West Bank of the Allegheny River, in the Cornplanter Reservation, in 1809, the same year as Abraham Lincoln. My father was John Logan, Jr., a Cayuga, the only surviving child of Captain John Logan, the oldest son of Shikellamy. My mother was a daughter of the Seneca Chief Cornplanter. My father after retiring from the war path, settled at Cold Spring, in the Allegheny Reservation, in New York State, where he died in 1944 aged 100 years. Early in life he married Annie, a daughter of Cornplanter, who bore him fine children, three daughters and two sons. The last were names Lyman and Jesse. When my grandfather was old he came to this Reservation, where he lived with my father until his death. To the best of my knowledge, he died in this reservation, and is buried near the grave of Chief Cornplanter. I married Susan, a Seneca maid, and we had one child, James Logan, who died at the age of thirty. He was named for my great-uncle, the immortal Cayuga orator. Physically, my father and my son were small men, much smaller than my grandfather and my great-uncle. I took after my grandfather, as I am of large stature. I remember Cornplanter, my maternal grandfather, very well. He was a large, strong man, not dark in color, and with grey eyes. He was a great man for work. Every morning, winter or summer, rain or shine, at six o'clock he would come out of his house and ring a big dinner bell as a signal for all to get busy. He wore a red cap much the same as the white hunters do now. I remember Philip Tome, the great elk and panther hunter, who lived a mile up the river. I hunted elk with the famous Jim Jacobs many times. I was taught to hunt by my grandfather, who died in 1820. He was a very old man when I was very young, but I recall what he looked like. I killed hundreds of elk, many bear and deer, and quite a few panthers, the last in 1860. I have always been fond of sports. I walk two miles to town (Corydon) every time there is a baseball game. As a boy I excelled at the Indian games of long ball and snow snake. I love a joke and enjoy a good dinner. I use tobacco and liquor sparingly. I attribute my long life to my love of outdoor exercise and hunting and fishing. In my old age I am well cared for by my Indian friends, but regret that 'my blood flows not in any living person,' to use the language of my great-uncle James. There are many Logans in the Reservations in Pennsylvania and New York; some are descended from my brother and sisters, others adopted the name because of the honor attached to it. I wish I had been invited to attend the unveiling of my great-grandfather's [Shikellamy's] monument in Sunbury next week, but I guess that the world has forgotten Logan. I tried to fight for the white man in the Civil War, but when I got to Harrisburg I was sent back as too old. But I was a dead shot, and can still beat men one-quarter of my age with the gun and bow and arrow. Next summer, if I live I hope to visit Logan Valley, where my grandfather resided, and view the scenes that my father loved to talk about. I would also like to visit Mrs. Gross, at Fort Augusta, who has done so much to honor Shikellamy's memory. I have lived a long while, but I am not tired of life, and each day seems new and pleasant to me.\\"Swanger, The Logans, Sons of Shikellamy =Yellow Creek Massacre= Logan's friendly relations with white settlers changed after the Yellow Creek Massacre of April 30, 1774. A group of Virginia Long knives led by Daniel Greathouse murdered a number of Mingo, among them Logan's brother (commonly known as John Petty) and at least two other close female relatives, one of them pregnant and caring for an infant daughter. Her children's father was John Gibson, a prominent trader in the region. These Mingo had been living near the mouth of Yellow Creek, and had been lured to the cabin of Joshua Baker, a settler and rum trader who lived across the Ohio River from their village. The Mingo in Baker's cabin were all murdered, except for the infant mixed-race child, who was spared with the intention of giving her to her father. At least two canoes were dispatched from the Yellow Creek village to aid their members, but they were repelled by Greathouse's men concealed along the river. In all, approximately a dozen Mingo were murdered in the cabin and on the river. Logan was not present in the area when the massacre took place, and was summoned to return by runners. =Logan's revenge= Influential tribal chiefs in the region, such as Cornstalk (Shawnee), White Eyes (Lenape), and Guyasuta (Seneca/Mingo), attempted to negotiate a peaceful resolution lest the incident develop into a larger war, but by Native American custom Logan had the right to retaliate for the murders. Several parties of mixed Mingo and Shawnee warriors soon struck the frontier, including one led by Logan. They attacked settlers in several frontier regions, both killing and taking captives. One known as the Spicer Massacre in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, responded by launching an expedition against the Mingo and Shawnee, in the conflict known as Dunmore's War. =Logan's Lament= Monument to Logan at the Logan Elm State Memorial in Pickaway County, Ohio. The text of \\"Logan's Lament\\" is inscribed on the other side of the monument. Logan was not at the Battle of Point Pleasant (October 10, 1774), the only major battle of Dunmore's War. Following the battle, Dunmore's army marched into the Ohio Country and compelled the Ohio Indians to agree to a peace treaty. According to tradition, Logan refused to attend the negotiations and instead made a speech that became legendary: The speech was printed in colonial newspapers, and in 1782 Thomas Jefferson reprinted it in his book Notes on the State of Virginia. The American elm tree in Pickaway County, Ohio under which Logan was said to have given the speech became known as the Logan Elm. it grew to great size before dying in 1964. =Logan's Letter= =Later life and death= The remainder of Logan's life is shrouded in obscurity. Logan continued his attacks on white settlers and associated himself with the Mohawk auxiliaries of the British during the American Revolution. He died in an altercation near Lake Erie in 1780.

Examples include microwave ovens, toasters, humidifiers, food processors and coffeemakers. They contrast with major appliances (British \\"white goods\\"), such as the refrigerator and washing machine, which cannot be easily moved and are generally placed on the floor. Small appliances also contrast with consumer electronics (British \\"brown goods\\") which are for leisure and entertainment rather than purely practical tasks. Uses Some small appliances perform the same or similar function as their larger counterparts. For example, a toaster oven is a small appliance that performs a similar function as an oven. Small appliances often have a home version and a commercial version, for example waffle irons, food processors, and blenders are small household appliances. A food processor will perform the tasks of chopper, slicer, mixer as well as juicer. Instead of buying multiple small appliances you can buy a single food processor. The commercial, or industrial, version is designed to be used nearly continuously in a restaurant or other similar setting. Commercial appliances are typically connected to a more powerful electrical outlet, are larger and stronger, have more user- serviceable parts, and cost significantly more. These commercial versions are capable of performing heavy tasks in one go. Types and examples An electric blender Small appliances include those used for : * Beverage-making, such as electric kettles, coffeemakers or iced tea-makers * Cleaning, such as Vacuum cleaner * Cooking, such as on a hot plate or with a microwave oven * Lighting, using light fixtures * Thermal comfort, such as an electric heater or fan * Kitchen , such as https://www.reviews4u63.com/2020/10/10-best-gas- stoves-in-india-in-2020-to.html gas stoves] & https://www.reviews4u63.com/2020/10/6-best-kitchen-chimneys-in-india-2020.html chimney\`s] Many small appliances perform a combination of the above processes such as mixing, heating by a bread machine Prices Small appliances can be very inexpensive, such as an electric can opener, hot pot, toaster, or coffee maker which may cost only a few U.S. dollars, or very expensive, such as an elaborate espresso maker, which may cost several thousand U.S. dollars. Most homes in developed economies contain several cheaper home appliances, with perhaps a few more expensive appliances, such as a high-end microwave oven or mixer. A small appliances like chopper, juicer, grinder and mixer may cost you few dollars. Instead of buying separate units the food processor will be less expensive. Sometime these kind of smart appliances saves money as well as the space. Powering Many small appliances are powered by electricity. The appliance may use a permanently attached cord which is plugged into a wall outlet or a detachable cord. The appliance may have a cord storage feature. A few hand-held appliances use batteries, which may be disposable or rechargeable. Some appliances consist of an electrical motor upon which is mounted various attachments so as to constitute several individual appliances, such as a blender, a food processor, or a juicer. Many stand mixers, while functioning primarily as a mixer, have attachments which can perform additional functions. A few gasoline and gas-powered appliances exist for use in situations where electricity is not expected to be available, but these are typically larger and not as portable as most small appliances. Items that perform the same function as small appliances but are hand powered are generally referred to as tools or gadgets, for example a hand cranked egg beater, a grater, a mandoline, or a hand-powered meat grinder. Safety Small appliances which are defective or improperly used or maintained may cause house fires and other property damage, or may harbor bacteria if not properly cleaned. It is important that users read the instructions carefully and that appliances that use a grounded cord be attached to a grounded outlet. Because of the risk of fire, some appliances have a short detachable cord that is connected to the appliance magnetically. If the appliance is moved further than the cord length from the wall, the cord will detach from the appliance.

It is most easily accessed in the north portion of Petrified Forest National Park. The Painted Desert is known for its brilliant and varied colors, that not only include the more common red rock, but also shades of lavender.  History  The Painted Desert was named by an expedition under Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado on his 1540 quest to find the Seven Cities of Cibola, which he located some east of Petrified Forest National Park. Finding the cities were not made of gold, Coronado sent an expedition to find the Colorado River to resupply him. Passing through the wonderland of colors, they named the area El Desierto Pintado (\\"The Painted Desert\\"). Much of the Painted Desert within Petrified Forest National Park is protected as Petrified Forest National Wilderness Area, where motorized travel is limited. Nonetheless, the park offers both easy and longer hikes into the colored hills. The Painted Desert continues north into the Navajo Nation, where off-road travel is allowed by permit. Geology The desert is composed of stratified layers of easily erodible siltstone, mudstone, and shale of the Triassic Chinle Formation. These fine grained rock layers contain abundant iron and manganese compounds which provide the pigments for the various colors of the region. Thin resistant lacustrine limestone layers and volcanic flows cap the mesas. Numerous layers of silicic volcanic ash occur in the Chinle and provide the silica for the petrified logs of the area. The erosion of these layers has resulted in the formation of the badlands topography of the region.Chronic, Halka, Pages of Stone: Geology of Grand Canyon & Plateau Country National Parks & Monuments, Mountaineers Books; 2nd ed., 2004, pp. 131-34 Baars, Donald L., Navajo Country, University of New Mexico Press, 1995 pp. 47-53 Baars, Donald L., The Colorado Plateau: a Geologic History, University of New Mexico Press, 1983, pp. 163-68 In the southern portions of the desert the remains of a Triassic period coniferous forest have fossilized over millions of years. Wind, water and soil erosion continue to change the face of the landscape by shifting sediment and exposing layers of the Chinle Formation. An assortment of fossilized prehistoric plants and animals are found in the region, as well as dinosaur tracks and the evidence of early human habitation. Area and climate The Painted Desert extends roughly from Cameron-Tuba City southeast to past Holbrook and the Petrified Forest National Park. The desert is about long by about wide, making it roughly in area.\\"Grand Canyon and Other Spectacular Sights in Arizona\\", on-the-matrix.com, Bordering southwest and south is the Mogollon Plateau, and on the plateau's south border the Mogollon Rim, the north border of the Arizona transition zone. Owing to the strong rain shadow of the Mogollon Rim, the Painted Desert has a cold desert climate (K√∂ppen BWk), with hot, dry summers and chilly (though virtually snow-free) winters. The annual precipitation is the lowest in northern Arizona and in many places is lower even than Phoenix.Arizona Annual Precipitation Map Accessibility Much of the region is accessible only by foot or unpaved road though major highways and paved roads cut across the area.

Jeffery Company between 1900 and 1914, then by its successor, Nash Motors from 1950 to 1954, and finally by Nash's successor, American Motors Corporation from 1954 to 1969 in the United States and 1983 in international markets. It was often nicknamed the \\"Kenosha Cadillac\\" after its place of manufacture. 1897‚Äì1914 The first use of the name Rambler for an American made automobile dates to 1897 when Thomas B. Jeffery of Chicago, Illinois and builder of the Rambler bicycle, constructed his first prototype automobile. After receiving positive reviews at the 1899 Chicago International Exhibition & Tournament and the first National Automobile Show in New York City, Jeffery decided to enter the automobile business. In 1900, he bought the old Sterling Bicycle Co. factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and set up shop. Jeffery started commercially mass-producing automobiles in 1902 and by the end of the year had produced 1,500 motorcars, one-sixth of all existing in the USA at the time. The Thomas B. Jeffery Company was the second largest auto manufacturer at that time, (behind Oldsmobile). Rambler experimented with such early technical innovations as a steering wheel (as opposed to a tiller), but it was decided that such features were too advanced for the motoring public of the day, so the first production Ramblers were tiller-steered. Rambler innovated various design features and was the first to equip cars with a spare wheel-and-tire assembly. This allowed the driver, when experiencing a common puncture (flat tires) to exchange the spare wheel & tire for the flat one. In 1914, Charles T. Jeffery, Thomas B. Jeffery's son, replaced the Rambler brand name with Jeffery in honor of his now deceased father. In 1916, the Thomas B. Jeffery Company was purchased by Charles W. Nash and became Nash Motors Company in 1917. The Jeffery brand name was dropped at the time of the sale and the manufacture of Nash branded automobiles commenced. In 1937, the concern became the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation through a merger with the well-known appliance maker. File:1901 Rambler A -Charles T.

Mason, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation began development of a small car that could be produced inexpensively for the post World War II economy. However, steel shortages limited the amount of raw materials that Nash could get, so Mason turned the compact, now designated the Rambler, into a two-door sedan with a convertible top and the cars were equipped with many standard features that were typically options, to maximize profits for the company. When introduced, the Rambler was an immediate success for Nash. As steel quotas (related to the Korean War) eased, the Rambler line was broadened in both its model types (first a station wagon and 2-door hardtop dubbed \\"Country Club\\", and later a 2-door sedan. A further expansion of the line for 1954 included a four-door sedan and station wagon called \\"Cross Country\\") on a stretched wheelbase, which proved to be as successful as the first generation of two-door sedan convertibles. The first generation of modern Ramblers carried a modified version of Nash's Airflyte styling, which included closed wheel openings. Where the wheel openings of any car are a major source of wind resistance, the design was rather primarily an engineering design to increase the strength of the car for impact resistance. Many people surmised that the skirted fenders limited the turning radius of the wheels but was not an actual handicap for having a comparatively narrow front track. Ramblers continued to use this styling until 1955, when the front wheels were revealed by a periodic design update. In 1954 the Rambler offered the first industry combination heating and air conditioning unit that could be an add-on or installed at the factory for $395.00, which at that time was about the lowest cost unit available in an American car. \\"Nash Low Cost Air Conditioner Cools or Heats by Turning Knob.\\" Popular Mechanics, May 1954, p. 86. In 1954, American Motors Corporation (AMC) was formed from the merger of Nash-Kelvinator and the Hudson Motor Car Company. Following the merger, 1955 and 1956 Ramblers were badged as both Nashes and Hudsons, with no visible difference between the two. Rambler became a marque in its own right for the 1957 model year. The Nash and Hudson makes were continued as senior model only through 1957, after which all of AMC's offerings were marketed as Ramblers, with the exception of the imported 1958‚Äì1962 Metropolitan.

In 1962, the Ambassador, a top-trim level model, was officially brought under the Rambler name (it had previously been named the \\"Ambassador by Rambler\\"), and the former Rambler Six and Rambler Rebel V8 were renamed the Rambler Classic. (Note: while the top-line models for 1958-1961 were advertised as the \\"Ambassador V-8 by Rambler\\", on the cars themselves, the nomenclature was \\"Rambler Ambassador\\".) Back in 1958, AMC introduced America's first \\"compact car,\\" the Rambler American. This car was essentially the 1950 Nash Rambler, slightly restyled and modernized for the late 1950s. However the car was an instant success and lost sales only after the \\"Big Three\\" (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) each introduced compact cars of their own (GM \\"X\\" body, Ford Falcon, Chrysler A platform). Romney also put into play his plan to slash production costs, which involved more common parts sharing between the Ambassador and Classic models. Beginning in 1962, all \\"senior\\" Rambler models would share the same automobile platform with identical wheelbase and body parts, but the engines, trims, and equipment levels distinguished the Classic from the Ambassador. The Rambler's compact size (by US standards) also made it an international competitor, and between 1961 and 1965 AMC opened thirteen foreign assembly plants, from Costa Rica to the Philippines. In 1963, the entire Rambler line received the Motor Trend Car of the Year award. However, Romney's departure to become Michigan governor opened the door for his successor, Roy Abernethy, to redirect the company towards a strategy of competing head to head with the Big Three (General Motors, Chrysler Corporation, and Ford Motor Company) with a variety of bodies and automobile platforms. This new plan also included marketing the various models apart from the Rambler brand name, which Abernethy felt would be a hindrance in the market segments he hoped to pursue. One of the first moves in that direction was the creation of the 1965 line of Ramblers, which split the Classic from the Ambassador visually, while still sharing a significant number of parts. Once again the Ambassador had a unique, extended wheelbase. In addition, AMC introduced the Marlin, a hardtop coupe intended to give AMC a toe-hold in the sporty fastback market while also functioning as a \\"halo\\" vehicle. AMC chief stylist Richard Teague introduced a totally restyled and attractive Rambler American in 1964, which was a sales success. This basic body remained in its original shape through 1969. Backed by marketing reports, Abernethy next made a persuasive argument to the AMC board that the Rambler name had not only acquired a stodgy image and was a hindrance to increasing sales, but that consumers associated it with compact cars. In what hindsight would show to be an ill-conceived decision, American Motors began to phase it out in favor of an AMC marque beginning in 1966, as it attempted to become a multiplatform automobile manufacturer. Retention of the well-known Rambler brand name and its association with compact economy models could have served AMC well in the 1970s. By 1968, the only vehicle produced by AMC to carry the Rambler marque was the compact Rambler American. Although designed as a no-nonsense economy car, the American spawned the audacious SC/Rambler developed with Hurst Performance. While AMC planned to produce only 500 for the 1969 model year, the \\"Scrambler\\" proved so popular two more groups of about 500 each were built. All featured the same V8, four-barrel carburetor, and close-ratio four- speed transmission of the AMX, plus Hurst shifter, Twin-Grip (limited slip) differential, and cold air hood. For the final year in 1969 the models were simply called Rambler. The 1969 Rambler (and Chevrolet Corvair and Dodge Dart) were the only U.S. compact cars available that year in a two-door hardtop body style; Ford compacts were only available as sedans. The last U.S. built Rambler was produced on 30 June 1969, and it was one of over 4.2 million cars to carry the Rambler name that rolled off the assembly line in Kenosha.

He wrote more than 200 songs, including \\"Oh! Susanna\\", \\"Hard Times Come Again No More\\", \\"Camptown Races\\", \\"Old Folks at Home\\" (\\"Swanee River\\"), \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\", \\"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\", \\"Old Black Joe\\", and \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\", and many of his compositions remain popular today. He has been identified as \\"the most famous songwriter of the nineteenth century\\" and may be the most recognizable American composer in other countries. Compare: Most of his handwritten music manuscripts are lost, but editions issued by publishers of his day feature in various collections. Biography Eliza Tomlinson Foster and William Barclay Foster There are many biographies on Foster, but details can differ widely. In addition, Foster wrote very little biographical information himself, and his brother Morrison Foster destroyed much of the information that he judged to reflect negatively upon the family. Foster was born on July 4, 1826, to William Barclay Foster and Eliza Clayland Tomlinson Foster, with three older sisters and six older brothers. His parents were of Ulster Scots and English descent. He attended private academies in Allegheny, Athens, and Towanda, Pennsylvania and received an education in English grammar, diction, the classics, penmanship, Latin, Greek, and mathematics. The family lived in a northern city but they did not support the abolition of slavery. Foster taught himself to play the clarinet, guitar, flute, and piano. He did not have formal instruction in composition but he was helped by Henry Kleber (1816‚Äì97), a German-born music dealer in Pittsburgh. In 1839, his brother William was serving his apprenticeship as an engineer at Towanda and thought that Stephen would benefit from being under his supervision. The site of the Camptown Races is from Athens and 15 miles from Towanda. His education included a brief period at Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania, now Washington & Jefferson College. His tuition was paid, but he had little spending money. He left Canonsburg to visit Pittsburgh with another student and did not return. Career In 1846, Foster moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and became a bookkeeper with his brother Dunning's steamship company. He wrote his first successful songs in 1848‚Äì1849, among them \\"Oh! Susanna\\", which became an anthem of the California Gold Rush. In 1849, he published Foster's Ethiopian Melodies, which included the successful song \\"Nelly Was a Lady\\" as made famous by the Christy Minstrels. A plaque marks the site of his residence in Cincinnati, where the Guilford School building is now located. House in Hoboken, New Jersey where Foster is believed to have written \\"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" in 1854 Then he returned to Pennsylvania and signed a contract with the Christy Minstrels. It was during this period that he wrote most of his best-known songs: \\"Camptown Races\\" (1850), \\"Nelly Bly\\" (1850), \\"Ring de Banjo\\" (1851), \\"Old Folks at Home\\" (known also as \\"Swanee River\\", 1851), \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" (1853), \\"Old Dog Tray\\" (1853), and \\"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" (1854), written for his wife Jane Denny McDowell. A Pittsburgh Press illustration of the original headstone on Stephen Foster's grave Many of Foster's songs were of the blackface minstrel show tradition popular at the time but now recognized as racist. He sought to \\"build up taste...among refined people by making words suitable to their taste, instead of the trashy and really offensive words which belong to some songs of that order\\". In the 1850s, he associated with a Pittsburgh-area abolitionist leader named Charles Shiras, and wrote an abolitionist play himself. Many of his songs had Southern themes, yet Foster never lived in the South and visited it only once, during his 1852 honeymoon. Foster's last four years were spent in New York City. There is little information on this period of his life, although family correspondence has been preserved. Illness and death Foster got sick with a fever in January 1864. Weakened, he fell in his hotel in the Bowery, cutting his neck. His writing partner George Cooper found him still alive but lying in a pool of blood. Foster died in Bellevue Hospital three days later at the age of 37. Other biographers describe different accounts of his death. Historian JoAnne O‚ÄôConnell speculates in her biography, The Life and Songs of Stephen Foster, that Foster may have killed himself, a common occurrence during the Civil War. George Cooper, who was with Foster until he died, said: ‚ÄúHe lay there on the floor, naked, suffering horribly. He had wonderful big brown eyes, and they looked up at me with an appeal I can never forget. He whispered, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm done for.‚Äô‚Äù Unlike Foster‚Äôs brother Morrison, who was not in New York and said Foster was ill and cut his neck on a washbasin, Cooper mentioned no broken crockery and also said Foster had a ‚Äúlarge knife‚Äù for cutting up apples and turnips. Morrison may have covered up Foster‚Äôs suicide. Evelyn Morneweck, Morrison‚Äôs daughter, also said the family would have covered up the suicide of their uncle if they could have. As O‚ÄôConnell and musicologist Ken Emerson have noted, several of the songs Foster wrote during the last years of his life foreshadow his death, such as ‚ÄúThe Little Ballad Girl‚Äù and ‚ÄúKiss Me Dear Mother Ere I Die.‚ÄùEmerson says in his 2010 Stephen Foster and Co. that Foster‚Äôs injuries may have been ‚Äúaccidental or self-inflicted.‚Äù Telegram that communicated Stephen Foster's death addressed to his brother Morrison Foster When Foster died, his leather wallet contained a scrap of paper that simply said, \\"Dear friends and gentle hearts\\", along with 38 cents (one for each year of his life) in Civil War scrip and three pennies. The note is said to have inspired Bob Hilliard's lyric for \\"Dear Hearts and Gentle People\\" (1949). Foster was buried in the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh. After his death, Morrison Foster became his \\"literary executor\\". As such, he answered requests for copies of manuscripts, autographs, and biographical information. One of the best-loved of his works was \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\", published shortly after his death. Music Foster grew up in a section of the city where many European immigrants had settled and was accustomed to hearing the music of the Italian, Scots-Irish, and German residents. He composed his first song when he was 14 and entitled it the \\"Tioga Waltz\\". The first song that he had published was \\"Open thy Lattice Love\\" (1844). He wrote songs in support of drinking, such as \\"My Wife Is a Most Knowing Woman\\", \\"Mr. and Mrs. Brown\\", and \\"When the Bowl Goes Round\\", while also composing temperance songs such as \\"Comrades Fill No Glass for Me\\" or \\"The Wife\\". Foster also authored many church hymns, although the inclusion of his hymns in hymnals ended by 1910. Some of the hymns are \\"Seek and ye shall find\\", \\"All around is bright and fair, While we work for Jesus\\", and \\"Blame not those who weep and sigh\\". Several rare Civil War-era hymns by Foster were performed by The Old Stoughton Musical Society Chorus, including \\"The Pure, The Bright, The Beautiful\\", \\"Over The River\\", \\"Give Us This Day\\", and \\"What Shall The Harvest Be?\\" Foster usually sent his handwritten scores directly to his publishers. The publishers kept the sheet music manuscripts and did not give them to libraries nor return them to his heirs. Some of his original, hand-written scores were bought and put into private collections and the Library of Congress. =Popular songs= Foster's songs lyrics and melodies have often been altered by publishers and performers. Ray Charles released a version of \\"Old Folks at Home\\" that was titled \\"Swanee River Rock (Talkin‚Äô ‚ÄôBout That River),\\" which became his first pop hit in November 1957.Whitburn, Joel, Top R&B; Singles, 1942‚Äì1999, p. 74. \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" is the official state song of Kentucky, adopted by the General Assembly on March 19, 1928. \\"Old Folks at Home\\" became the official state song of Florida, designated in 1935. The lyrics are widely regarded as racist today, however, so \\"Old Folks at Home\\" was modified with approval from the Stephen Foster Memorial. The modified song was kept as the official state song, while \\"Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky)\\" was added as the state anthem. Critics and controversies From a modern perspective Foster's compositions can be seen as disparaging to African Americans, or outright racist. Apologists have argued that Foster unveiled the realities of slavery in his work while also imparting some dignity to African Americans in his compositions, especially as he grew as an artist. Foster composed many songs that were used in minstrel shows. This form of public entertainment lampooned African Americans as buffoonish, superstitious, without a care, musical, lazy, and dim-witted.\\"The Coon Character\\".

There is also a statue of him next to the Federal Hill mansion, where he visited relatives and which is the inspiration for My Old Kentucky Home. A painting by Howard Chandler Christy entitled, \\"Stephen Foster and the Angel of Genius\\" is on display in the park's art collection. The painting inspired Florence Foster Jenkins to author a tableau in which she personally plays the role of the angel depicted in Christy's painting. The scene was featured in the film Florence Foster Jenkins in 2016. Accolades and honors The Stephen Collins Foster sketchbook kept in a safe in the research library in the memorial Pitt's Stephen Foster Memorial contains two theaters Foster is honored on the University of Pittsburgh campus with the Stephen Foster Memorial, a landmark building that houses the Stephen Foster Memorial Museum, the Center for American Music, as well as two theaters: the Charity Randall Theatre and Henry Heymann Theatre, both performance spaces for Pitt's Department of Theater Arts. It is the largest repository for original Stephen Foster compositions, recordings, and other memorabilia his songs have inspired worldwide. Two state parks are named in Foster's honor: the Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park in White Springs, Florida and Stephen C. Foster State Park in Georgia. Both parks are on the Suwannee River. Stephen Foster Lake at Mount Pisgah State Park in Pennsylvania is also named in his honor. One state park is named in honor of Foster's songs, My Old Kentucky Home, an historic mansion formerly named Federal Hill, located in Bardstown, Kentucky where Stephen is said to have been an occasional visitor according to his brother, Morrison Foster. The park dedicated a bronze statue in honor of Stephen's work. The Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh) Historical Society, together with the Allegheny Cemetery Historical Association, hosts the annual Stephen Foster Music and Heritage Festival (Doo Dah Days!). Held the first weekend of July, Doo Dah Days! celebrates the life and music of one of the most influential songwriters in America's history. His home in the Lawrenceville Section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, still remains on Penn Avenue nearby the Stephen Foster Community Center. A 1900 statue of Foster by Giuseppe Moretti was located in Schenley Plaza, in Pittsburgh, from 1940 until 2018. On the unanimous recommendation of the Pittsburgh Art Commission, the statue was removed on April 26, 2018. Its new home has not yet been determined. It has a long reputation as the most controversial public art in Pittsburgh \\"for its depiction of an African- American banjo player at the feet of the seated composer. Critics say the statue glorifies white appropriation of black culture, and depicts the vacantly smiling musician in a way that is at best condescending and at worst racist.\\" A city-appointed Task Force on Women in Public Art called for the statue to be replaced with one honoring an African American woman with ties to the Pittsburgh community. The Task Force held a series of community forums in Pittsburgh to collect public feedback on the statue replacement and circulated an online form which allowed the public to vote for one of seven previously selected candidates or write in an alternate suggestion. However, the Task Force on Women in Public Art and the Pittsburgh Art Commission have not reached an agreement as to who will be commemorated or if the statue will stay in the Schenley Plaza location.

These watertight trough-like channels could be built to span a long distance across chasms and down steep mountain slopes. The use of log flumes facilitated the quick and cheap transportation of logs and thereby eliminated the need for horse- or oxen-drawn carriages on dangerous mountain trails. Early flumes were square chutes that were prone to jams that could cause damage and required constant maintenance. In 1868, James W. Haines first built the \\"V\\"-shaped log flumes that allowed a jammed log to free itself as the rising water level in the flume pushed it up. These efficient flumes consisted of two boards, wide, joined perpendicularly, and came in common use in the western United States during the late 19th century. The longest log flume was reputedly the Kings River Flume in Sanger, California. Built in 1890 by the Kings River Lumber Company, it spanned over from the Sierra Nevada to the lumber yard and railroad depot in Sanger. Together with a constant water supply from a nearby reservoir, the flume enabled the efficient transportation of boards of lumber over deep gorges and cliffs and thereby opened up the area now known as Sequoia National Forest for clearcutting of the giant redwood forests. Proper operation was ensured by \\"flume herders\\" who at various locations along the flume checked the flow of lumber and water. On occasion, despite being exceedingly dangerous, flume herders and others would ride down the flume in small craft or boats, either for inspection or for thrills. Such rides were the precursor of the modern log-ride amusement park attractions.

The crisis began to unfold in the beginning of the 1990s.  History  Total population of Russia 1950‚Äì2010 = In the economic sphere = The demographic crisis has a positive economic effect on the second stage of the changing age structure of the population (the fraction of the average working-age generation is maximal at a relatively small proportion of younger and older) and a negative economic effect on the third stage of the changing age structure of the population (when the proportion of the older generation is maximal at a relatively small share younger and middle generation). By 2025, Russia will have labor shortages. With a reduced fertility rate, the load on the working population increases because each worker has to support more retirees. The rapid rise in the birth rate in a short period of time is difficult to implement due to economic reasons; sharply increased social spending on the old generation, which in the future will only bring troubles.  Demographic ageing of the population  Russia at the end of the 19th century was a country with a young population: the number of children significantly exceeded the number of the elderly. Up to 1938, the population of the Soviet Union remained \\"demographically young\\", but later, since 1959, began its demographic ageing: the proportion of young age began to decline, and the elderly ‚Äì to increase, which was the result of lower fertility. This was not unique to Russia, and such issues have been felt in many developed countries and increasingly in many developing countries as well. In 1990, Russia ranked 25th in the list of countries with high rates of population ageing. Currently, the share of people aged 65 and older in the population of Russia is 13%. According to forecasts of the Russian Academy of Sciences from the early 2000s, in 2016 elderly people aged over 60 would have accounted for 20% of Russians, and children up to 15 years would only have made up 17%. However in Russia, in contrast to other countries, ageing is limited by high mortality among older people.

Demographics of Russia Antinatalism ","title":"Demographic crisis of Russia"},{"id":"176613","text":"The boysenberry is a cross among the European raspberry (Rubus idaeus), European blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), American dewberry (Rubus aboriginum), and loganberry (Rubus √ó loganobaccus). It is a large aggregate fruit, with large seeds and a deep maroon color.  History  The exact origins of the boysenberry are unclear, but the most definite records trace the plant as it is known today back to grower Rudolph Boysen, who obtained the dewberry- loganberry parent from the farm of John Lubben. In the late 1920s, George M. Darrow of the USDA began tracking down reports of a large, reddish-purple berry that had been grown on Boysen's farm in Anaheim, California. Darrow enlisted the help of Walter Knott, another farmer, who was known as a berry expert. Knott had never heard of the new berry, but he agreed to help Darrow in his search. Darrow and Knott learned that Boysen had abandoned his growing experiments several years earlier and sold his farm. Undaunted by this news, Darrow and Knott headed out to Boysen's old farm, on which they found several frail vines surviving in a field choked with weeds. They transplanted the vines to Knott's farm in Buena Park, California, where he nurtured them back to fruit-bearing health. Walter Knott was the first to commercially cultivate the berry in Southern California. He began selling the berries at his farm stand in 1932 and soon noticed that people kept returning to buy the large, tasty berries. When asked what they were called, Knott said, \\"Boysenberries,\\" after their originator. His family's small restaurant and pie business eventually grew into Knott's Berry Farm. As the berry's popularity grew, Mrs. Knott began making preserves, which ultimately made Knott's Berry Farm famous. By 1940, of land in California were dedicated to boysenberries. The number trailed off during World War II but peaked again in the 1950s at about 2,400 acres, to the point where boysenberry crops exceeded those of the (previously) more common raspberry and blackberry. By the 1960s, the boysenberry began to fall out of favor due to a combination of being difficult to cultivate, susceptible to fungal diseases in coastal growing areas, and too soft and delicate to easily ship without damage, as well as having a short season of availability compared with newer cultivars. In the 1980s, breeding efforts in New Zealand combined cultivars and germplasm from California with Scottish sources to create five new thornless varieties. As of the early 2000s, fresh boysenberries were generally only grown for market by smaller California farmers and sold from local farm stands and markets. Most commercially grown boysenberries, primarily from Oregon, are processed into other products such as jam, pie, juice, syrup, and ice cream. As of 2016, New Zealand was the world's largest producer and exporter of boysenberries. Cultivars Since 2007, a hybrid variety called the \\"Newberry\\" or \\"Ruby Boysen\\", was developed to overcome cultivation challenges that led to the decline in boysenberry popularity, and was marketed through farm markets and retailers in California. There is also a hybrid variety with marionberry called \\"Silvanberry\\" in Australia. Classed under the blackberry family, Sylvanberry plants have many characteristics commonly found among other blackberry varieties. These plants are long living (15 to 20 years) perennials, hardy and cold tolerant, easy to grow, and productive spreaders.Silvanberry Planting ‚Äì How To Grow Silvanberries  Characteristics  Boysenberries grow on low, trailing plants and are characterized by their soft texture, thin skins, and sweet-tart flavor. Mature fruits leak juice very easily and can start to decay within a few days of harvest.

The starter is a substitute for baking yeast and can be used to make many kinds of yeast-based breads, shared with friends, or frozen for future use. The sweet, cake-like Amish cinnamon bread is a common bread that is made from this starter; it is a simple, stirred quickbread that includes a substantial amount of sugar and vegetable oil, with a mild cinnamon flavor. It has characteristics of both pound cake and coffee cake. The flavor of the finished product can be altered by cinnamon being omitted. A common recipe using this starter suggests using one cup (240 ml) of it to make bread, keeping one cup to start a new cycle, and giving the remaining three cups to friends. The process of sharing the starter makes it somewhat like a chain letter. One cup of starter makes one standard loaf of bread. History There is no reason to think that the sweet, cinnamon-flavored bread has any connection to the Amish people, although the name is taken from them. According to Elizabeth Coblentz, a member of the Old Order Amish and the author of the syndicated column \\"The Amish Cook\\", true Amish friendship bread is \\"just sourdough bread that is passed around to the sick and needy\\". The recipe for Amish cinnamon bread may have first been posted to the Internet in 1990,*A 1990 Usenet posting which may be the first mention of this bread on the Internet but the recipe itself is several decades old. Although the origin of Amish friendship bread is up for debate, it is similar to a cake called Herman friendship cake which was developed in Europe. Anne Byrn, who researched hundreds of historical recipes for her book American Cake remembers the friendship bread craze popping up in newspaper columns in the late 1980s, but thinks the recipe can be traced back much further. Obtaining starter Starter can easily be created from scratch with a package of regular baker's yeast and the ingredients that are used to maintain it. Also it is possible to create it in a baker's kitchen through natural wild yeasts. Typically, however, a friend shares a cup of the liquid yeast culture with people who would like to make this bread. The starter is typically maintained by adding sugar, flour and milk every few days, although any source of water and food for the yeast will work. Controlling the starter cycle A common cycle is based on the addition of one cup each of sugar, flour, and milk every five days, with bread baked and extra starter shared every tenth day. The ten-day cycle produces five cups of starter, which must be either used to bake bread, given away, or used to start a new cycle. A common suggestion is to bake one loaf of bread, give away three cups of starter, and to save the remaining one for the next cycle. It is not necessary to wait the canonical ten days before using one cup of starter: a cup of starter can be used as a yeast substitute at any point. However, using starter on earlier days will result in a smaller quantity of starter at the end of the cycle. To avoid running out of starter, it is normal to feed the starter (add milk, sugar, and flour) before removing a cup for use, and most recipes assume that starter is always fed immediately before being removed. A five-day baking cycle feeds the starter every fifth day and uses the resulting mixture on that day to bake one or two loaves of bread (one cup per loaf). The remaining starter is reserved to begin the next five-day fermentation cycle. Despite common instructions to the contrary, the starter can be frozen for later use, and the cycle begun anew after thawing. The cycle can also be slowed to about half the normal fermentation rate by refrigerating the starter instead of allowing it to ferment at room temperature. Refrigeration is usually recommended if a few days' delay is desired.

The reaction is named after Adolf Pinner, who first described it in 1877. Pinner salts are themselves reactive and undergo additional nucleophilic additions to give various useful products: * With an excess of alcohol to form an orthoester * With ammonia or an amine to form an amidine * With water to form an ester * With hydrogen sulfide to form a thionoester center Commonly the Pinner salt itself is not isolated, with the reaction being continued to give the desired functional group (orthoester etc.) in one go. It should be appreciated that the Pinner reaction refers specifically to an acid catalyzed process, but that similar results can often be achieved using base catalysis. The two approaches can be complementary, with nitriles which are unreactive under acid conditions often giving better results in the presence of base, and vice versa. The determining factor is typically how electron-rich or poor the nitrile is. For example: an electron-poor nitrile is a good electrophile (readily susceptible to attack from alkoxides etc.) but a poor nucleophile would be difficult to protonate and hence would be expected to react more readily under basic rather than acidic conditions.

Born in Jun√≠n, Argentina, he was nicknamed The Wild Bull of the Pampas. Boxing career In 1917, Firpo began his professional boxing career by beating Frank Hagney by a decision in six in Buenos Aires. Originally declared a no decision, the bout's result was later changed to a win for Firpo. For his second bout, he traveled, in January 1918, to Montevideo, Uruguay, where he suffered his first defeat, a first round knockout at the hands of Angel Rodriguez. He put a string of six wins in a row after that, and so on November 1, 1919, he found himself challenging Dave Mills in Santiago, for the South American Heavyweight title. He lost on that occasion by a decision in 15 rounds, but then came back with a win over Andres Balsa by a knockout in round six. Luis √Ångel Firpo and his handlers. On April 20, 1920, he and Mills had a rematch and Firpo won the title with a first-round knockout. After one more win, he and Mills faced each other in a rubber match, and the result was the same as that of their second bout: Firpo the winner by a knockout in the first. In 1921, the quality of Firpo's challengers improved, when he defeated fringe contender Gunboat Smith twice, the first by decision in 12 and the second by knockout, also in 12. In 1922, he continued his rise in the Heavyweight rankings by winning all four of his fights by a knockout. Firpo began 1923 by knocking out former title challenger Bill Brennan in the 12th round. He followed that with seven more wins in a row, including wins over Jack McAuliffe and former world champion Jess Willard. After a win against Charlie Weinert, Firpo challenged world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey at New York City on September 14, becoming the first Latin American in history to challenge for the title. Firpo was floored seven times in the first round of the bout, before he trapped Dempsey against the ropes and launched a combination that sent the champion out of the ring. Dempsey hit his head against a writer's typing machine, and for a moment, it looked as if Firpo would become world Heavyweight champion. But Dempsey was helped into the ring at the count of nine (in spite of having been seventeen seconds outside the ring; fighters are given a twenty-second count when they are knocked through the ropes) and he eventually knocked out Firpo in the second round. This fight has been regarded by critics and experts as one of the greatest fights in history. Boxing historian Bert Sugar called it the greatest fight in the history of the sport. Despite losing, Firpo gained substantial fame all over Latin America after this bout, as many people in different parts of that region spoke about his feat of dropping Dempsey. This fight remained so inspirational that, for instance, it led to the naming of the Salvadorian football club C.D. Luis √Ångel Firpo. Firpo sending Dempsey outside the ring; Dempsey and Firpo, 1923 painting by George Bellows. In 1924, Firpo won his first three fights by knockout, but then lost his last two by decision, the last to legendary challenger Harry Wills. He retired for a short period, but came back in 1926 to beat Erminio Spalla by a decision in ten. Then, he kept away from the fight game for nine years, but he attempted another comeback in 1936, winning two fights before being beaten by a knockout in three by future Joe Louis challenger Arturo Godoy. Firpo finally retired after compiling a record of 32 wins and 6 losses in 38 fights, with 26 wins by knockout. Retirement Afterwards, Firpo became a car-dealer for Stutz and a rancher. By 1940 he was ranching on a large scale in Carlos Casares with 8,000 cattle, 4,000 sheep and 400 horses. He discovered the boxer Abel Cestac in July 1940. Firpo and Jack Dempsey agreed to jointly manage Cestac, who went on to become the South American heavyweight champion. On his passing in 1960, Luis Firpo was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. His mausoleum has a statue of him at the front.The Rough Guide to Buenos Aires Legacy Luis Angel Firpo vault in the Cemetery of Recoleta, Buenos Aires, where his remains were interred. Firpo's popularity around Latin America was immeasurable. Years later, C.D. Luis √Ångel Firpo, a professional football team in El Salvador, a Central American country thousands of miles north of Argentina, was named after him. In addition, various schools, streets, and avenues across Latin America have been named after him. In 2003, he was named by The Ring as one of the 100 greatest punchers of all time.

Established in 1905, the school trains about 850 undergraduate and graduate students in dance, drama, and music. It is widely regarded as one of the world's leading drama, music and dance schools, with some of the most prestigious arts programs. History Alice Tully Hall in the Juilliard School building The Juilliard School In 1905, the Institute of Musical Art, Juilliard's predecessor institution, was founded on the premise that the United States did not have a premier music school and too many students were going to Europe to study music. The Institute opened in the former Lenox Mansion, Fifth Avenue and 12th Street, on October 11. It moved in 1910 to 120 Claremont Avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, onto a property purchased from Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. In 1920, the Juilliard Foundation was created, named after textile merchant Augustus D. Juilliard, who bequeathed a substantial amount of money for the advancement of music in the United States. In 1924, the foundation purchased the Vanderbilt family guesthouse at 49 E. 52nd Street, and established the Juilliard Graduate School. In 1926, the Juilliard School of Music was created through a merger of the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Graduate School. The two schools shared a common board of directors and president (Columbia University professor John Erskine) but retained their distinct identities. The conductor and music-educator Frank Damrosch continued as the Institute's dean, and the Australian pianist and composer Ernest Hutcheson was appointed dean of the Graduate School. In 1937, Hutcheson succeeded Erskine as president of the two institutions, a job he held until 1945. In 1946, the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Graduate School completely merged to form a single institution. The president of the school at that time was William Schuman, the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Music. Schuman established the Juilliard String Quartet in 1946 and the Dance Division in 1951, under the direction of Martha Hill. William Schuman graduated from Columbia's Teachers College (BS 1935, MA 1937) and attended the Juilliard Summer School in 1932, 1933 and 1936. While attending Juilliard Summer School, he developed a personal dislike for traditional music theory and ear training curricula, finding little value in counterpoint and dictation. Soon after being appointed as president of the Juilliard School of Music in 1945, William Schuman created a new curriculum called the Literature and Materials of Music (L&M;), designed for composers to teach. L&M; was a reaction against more formal theory and ear training, and as a result did not have a formal structure. The general mandate was \\"to give the student an awareness of the dynamic nature of the materials of music.\\" The quality and degree of each student's education in harmony, music history, or ear training was dependent on how each composer-teacher decided to interpret this mandate. William Schuman resigned as president of Juilliard after being elected president of Lincoln Center in 1962. Peter Mennin, another composer with directorial experience at the Peabody Conservatory, was elected as his successor. Mennin made significant changes to the L&M; program‚Äîending ear training and music history and hiring the well known pedagogue Ren√©e Longy to teach solf√®ge. In 1968, Mennin hired John Houseman to manage a new Drama Division, and in 1969 oversaw Juilliard's relocation from Claremont Avenue to Lincoln Center. The School's name was changed to The Juilliard School to reflect its broadened mission to educate musicians, directors, and actors.A Brief History, The Juilliard School. Retrieved June 13, 2010.Juilliard School, The, The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. 2007, Columbia University Press, found in Infoplease. Retrieved June 13, 2010. Dr. Joseph W. Polisi became president of Juilliard in 1984 after Peter Mennin died. Polisi's many accomplishments include philanthropic successes, broadening of the curriculum and establishment of dormitories for Juilliard's students. In 2001, the school established a jazz performance training program. In September 2005, Colin Davis conducted an orchestra that combined students from the Juilliard and London's Royal Academy of Music at the BBC Proms, and during 2008 the Juilliard Orchestra embarked on a successful tour of China, performing concerts as part of the Cultural Olympiad in Beijing, Suzhou, and Shanghai under the expert leadership of Maestro Xian Zhang. In 1999, the Juilliard School was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 2006, Juilliard received a trove of precious music manuscripts from board chair and philanthropist Bruce Kovner. The collection includes autograph scores, sketches, composer-emended proofs and first editions of major works by Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann, Chopin, Schubert, Liszt, Ravel, Stravinsky, Copland, and other masters of the classical music canon. Many of the manuscripts had been unavailable for generations. Among the items are the printer's manuscript of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, complete with Beethoven's handwritten amendments, that was used for the first performance in Vienna in 1824; Mozart's autograph of the wind parts of the final scene of The Marriage of Figaro; Beethoven's arrangement of his monumental Gro√üe Fuge for piano four hands; Schumann's working draft of his Symphony No. 2; and manuscripts of Brahms's Symphony No. 2 and Piano Concerto No. 2. The entire collection has since been digitized and can be viewed online. In 2010, philanthropist James S. Marcus donated $10 million to the school to establish the Ellen and James S. Marcus Institute for Vocal Arts at the school. On September 28, 2015, The Juilliard School announced a major expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, the institution's first such full-scale foray outside the United States, with plans to offer a master's degree program. In May 2017, retired New York City Ballet principal dancer Damian Woetzel was named president, replacing Joseph W. Polisi. Admission Juilliard admits both degree program seekers and pre- college division students. The latter enter a conservatory program for younger students to develop their skills; All applicants who wish to enroll in the Music Advancement Program, for the Pre-College Division, must perform an audition in person before members of the faculty and administration and must be between ages 8 and 18. The Juilliard admissions program comprises several distinct steps. Applicants must submit a complete application, school transcripts, and recommendations; some majors also require that applicants submit prescreening recordings of their work, which are evaluated as part of the application. A limited number of applicants are then invited to a live audition, sometimes with additional callbacks. After auditions, the school invites select applicants to meet with a program administrator. Admission to The Juilliard School is highly competitive. In 2007, the school received 2,138 applications for admission, of which 162 were admitted for a 7.6% acceptance rate. For the fall semester of 2009, the school had an 8.0% acceptance rate. In 2011, the school accepted 5.5% of applicants. For Fall 2012, 2,657 undergraduate applicants were received by the college division and 7.2% were accepted. The 75th percentile accepted into Juilliard in 2012 had a GPA of 3.96 and an SAT score of 1350. Programs The school offers courses in dance, drama, and music. The Dance Division was established in 1951 by William Schuman with Martha Hill as its director. It offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts or a Diploma. The Drama Division was established in 1968 by the actor John Houseman and Michel Saint-Denis. Its acting programs offer a Bachelor of Fine Arts, a Diploma and, beginning in Fall 2012, a Master of Fine Arts. Until 2006, when James Houghton became director of the Drama Division, there was a \\"cut system\\" that would remove up to one-third of the second-year class. The Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program, begun in 1993, offers one- year, tuition-free, graduate fellowships; selected students may be offered a second-year extension and receive an Artist Diploma. The Andrew W. Mellon Artist Diploma Program for Theatre Directors was a two-year graduate fellowship that began in 1995 (expanded to three years in 1997) this was discontinued from autumn 2006. The Music Division is the largest of the school's divisions. Available degrees are Bachelor of Music or Diploma, Master of Music or Graduate Diploma, Artist Diploma and Doctor of Musical Arts. Academic majors are brass, collaborative piano, composition, guitar, harp, historical performance, jazz studies, orchestral conducting, organ, percussion, piano, strings, voice, and woodwinds. The collaborative piano, historical performance, and orchestral conducting programs are solely at the graduate level; the opera studies and music performance subprograms only offer Artist Diplomas. The Juilliard Vocal Arts department now incorporates the former Juilliard Opera Center. All Bachelor and Master courses require credits from the Liberal Arts course; Joseph W. Polisi is a member of the Liberal Arts faculty. =Pre-College Division= The Pre-College Division teaches students enrolled in elementary, junior high, and high school. The Pre-College Division is conducted every Saturday from September to May in the Juilliard Building at Lincoln Center. All students study solf√®ge and music theory in addition to their primary instrument. Vocal majors must also study diction and performance. Similarly, pianists must study piano performance. String, brass and woodwind players, as well as percussionists, also participate in orchestra. The pre-college has two orchestras, the Pre-College Symphony (PCS) and the Pre-College Orchestra (PCO). Placement is by age and students may elect to study conducting, chorus, and chamber music. The Pre-College Division began as the Preparatory Centers (later the Preparatory Division), part of the Institute of Musical Art since 1916. The Pre-College Division was established in 1969 with Katherine McC. Ellis as its first director. Olegna Fuschi served as director from 1975 to 1988. The Fuschi/Mennin partnership allowed the Pre- College Division to thrive, affording its graduates training at the highest artistic level (with many of the same teachers as the college division), as well as their own commencement ceremony and diplomas. In addition to Fuschi, directors of Juilliard's Pre-College Division have included composer Dr. Andrew Thomas. The current director of the Pre-College Division is Yoheved Kaplinsky. =Music Technology Center= The Music Technology Center at the Juilliard School was created in 1993 to provide students with the opportunity to use digital technology in the creation and performance of new music. Since then, the program has expanded to include a wide offering of classes such as, Introduction to Music Technology, Music Production, Film Scoring, Computers In Performance and an Independent Study In Composition. In 2009, the Music Technology Center moved to a new, state of the art facility that includes a mix and record suite and a digital \\"playroom\\" for composing and rehearsing with technology. Together with the Willson Theater, the Music Technology Center is the home of interdisciplinary and electro-acoustic projects and performances at the Juilliard School. =Juilliard Electric Ensemble= The Juilliard Electric Ensemble was created in 2003 to provide students from all three of Juilliard's divisions (dance, drama, and music) with an opportunity to use new technology in the creation and performance of interactive and multi-disciplinary work. In past performances, the Juilliard Electric Ensemble has used interactive technology to expand the range of their instruments, control audio and visual elements with electronic tools, shape video and projection design in real-time by moving through a virtual field, and interact with artists and computers around the world via the web. Since its debut, the Electric Ensemble has performed works by over 50 composers including Joan La Barbara, Kenji Bunch, Eric Chasalow, Sebastian Currier, Avner Dorman, Jonathan Harvey, Jocelyn Pook, Steve Reich, Daniel Bernard Roumain, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Morton Subotnick, Alejandro Vi√±ao, Jacob ter Veldhuis, David Wallace, Mark Wood, and Peter Wyer. Performing ensembles Morse Hall, one of the performing spaces inside the Juilliard School The Juilliard School has a variety of ensembles, including chamber music, jazz, orchestras, and vocal/choral groups. Juilliard's orchestras include the Juilliard Orchestra, the New Juilliard Ensemble, the Juilliard Theatre Orchestra, and the Conductors' Orchestra. The Axiom Ensemble is a student directed and managed group dedicated to well-known 20th-century works. In addition, several ensembles of Juilliard Faculty, called Resident Ensembles, perform frequently at the school. These groups include the Juilliard String Quartet, the American Brass Quintet, the New York Woodwind Quintet, and Juilliard Baroque. Fundraising The Juilliard Second Century Fund aims to raise $300 million to enable the Juilliard School to sustain its eminence in performing arts education well into the school's next century. The tuition for 2019-20 is $47,370 for the school year, with total expenses of $69‚Äì73,500.https://www.juilliard.edu/campus-life/tuition-financial- aid/tuition-fees-and-expenses Expanded and renamed on Juilliard's 100th anniversary, the fund supports six components that help Juilliard continue to recruit the world's best young artists and faculty, offer educational programs that maintain the quality of a Juilliard education, and increase the size and functionality of Juilliard's physical plant. Fundraising specifically targeted to the Pre-College Division began during 2004 with a benefit concert given by the Park Avenue Chamber Symphony. The event raised $90,000 to establish a Pre- College Parents' Association Scholarship Fund. During 2005, Juilliard produced its own benefit concert for the Pre-College Division featuring its own students directed by faculty member Itzhak Perlman and hosted by entertainer Bill Cosby to add to this fund. In April 2009, it was announced that the Music Advancement Program (MAP) would be curtailed due to budget reductions. After strong opposition to the reductions, the program, which helps inner-city children get music lessons, was then reinstated after several donors pledged money to support it.

It is about north of Alnwick, within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Attraction Seahouses attracts many visitors, mainly from the north east area. However national and international tourists often come to Seahouses whilst visiting the Northumberland National Park, Northumberland Coast and the Farne Islands. Seahouses also has a working fishing port, which also serves the tourist trade, being the embarkation point for visits to the Farne Islands. From shops in the town and booths along the harbour, several boat companies operate, offering various packages which may include inter alia landing on at least one Farne, seeing seals and seabirds, and hearing a commentary on the islands and the Grace Darling story or scuba diving on the many Farne Islands wrecks. Grace Darling's brother is buried in the cemetery at North Sunderland. He died in 1903, aged 84. The current Seahouses lifeboat bears the name Grace Darling. The Seahouses Festival is an annual cultural event which began in 1999 as a small sea shanty festival. After a significant European funding grant from the Leader+ programme, in 2005,http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID;=167692 it has grown into a more broadly based cultural celebration. The fish processing factory in Seahouses is one of the places where the practice of kippering herrings is said to have originated There are claims that kippers were first created in Seahouses in the 1800s, and they are still produced locally to this day. Between 1898 and 1951, Seahouses was the north-eastern terminus of the North Sunderland Railway. Independent until its final closure, it formed a standard gauge rail link between the village and Chathill Station on the East Coast Main Line (Wright, 1988). The site of Seahouses station is now the town car park and the trackbed between village and North Sunderland is a public footpath. Governance Seahouses is within the civil parish of North Sunderland and the Northumberland County Council electoral division of Bamburgh, The parliamentary constituency is Berwick-upon-Tweed, represented by MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan (Conservative). Religion Seahouses is in the Anglican archdeaconry of Lindisfarne, in the Diocese of Newcastle.

It is distinguished by its irregular shape, its chaotic rotation, and its unexplained sponge-like appearance. It was the first non-round moon to be discovered.  Name  The moon is named after Hyperion, the Titan god of watchfulness and observation ‚Äì the elder brother of Cronus, the Greek equivalent of Saturn ‚Äì in Greek mythology. It is also designated Saturn VII. The adjectival form of the name is Hyperionian. Hyperion's discovery came shortly after John Herschel had suggested names for the seven previously known satellites of Saturn in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. William Lassell, who saw Hyperion two days after William Bond, had already endorsed Herschel's naming scheme and suggested the name Hyperion in accordance with it. He also beat Bond to publication.  Physical characteristics  = Shape = Hyperion is one of the largest bodies known to be highly irregularly shaped (non-ellipsoidal, i.e. not in hydrostatic equilibrium) in the Solar System. The only larger moon known to be irregular in shape is Neptune's moon Proteus. Hyperion has about 15% of the mass of Mimas, the least massive known ellipsoidal body. The largest crater on Hyperion is approximately in diameter and deep. A possible explanation for the irregular shape is that Hyperion is a fragment of a larger body that was broken up by a large impact in the distant past. A proto- Hyperion could have been in diameter. Over about 1,000 years, ejecta from a presumed Hyperion breakup would have impacted Titan at low speeds, building up volatiles in the atmosphere of Titan. Cassini spacecraft. = Composition = Like most of Saturn's moons, Hyperion's low density indicates that it is composed largely of water ice with only a small amount of rock. It is thought that Hyperion may be similar to a loosely accreted pile of rubble in its physical composition. However, unlike most of Saturn's moons, Hyperion has a low albedo (0.2‚Äì0.3), indicating that it is covered by at least a thin layer of dark material. This may be material from Phoebe (which is much darker) that got past Iapetus. Hyperion is redder than Phoebe and closely matches the color of the dark material on Iapetus. Hyperion has a porosity of about 0.46. = Surface features = Voyager 2 passed through the Saturn system, but photographed Hyperion only from a distance. It discerned individual craters and an enormous ridge, but was not able to make out the texture of Hyperion's surface. Early images from the Cassini orbiter suggested an unusual appearance, but it was not until Cassini's first targeted flyby of Hyperion on 25 September 2005 that Hyperion's oddness was revealed in full. Hyperion's surface is covered with deep, sharp-edged craters that give it the appearance of a giant sponge. Dark material fills the bottom of each crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of carbon and hydrogen and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably Iapetus. Scientists attribute Hyperion's unusual, sponge-like appearance to the fact that it has an unusually low density for such a large object. Its low density makes Hyperion quite porous, with a weak surface gravity. These characteristics mean impactors tend to compress the surface, rather than excavating it, and most material that is blown off the surface never returns. The latest analyses of data obtained by Cassini during its flybys of Hyperion in 2005 and 2006 show that about 40 percent of it is empty space. It was suggested in July 2007 that this porosity allows craters to remain nearly unchanged over the eons. The new analyses also confirmed that Hyperion is composed mostly of water ice with very little rock.  Rotation  Animation of Hyperion's orbit. Cassini space probe. The Voyager 2 images and subsequent ground-based photometry indicated that Hyperion's rotation is chaotic, that is, its axis of rotation wobbles so much that its orientation in space is unpredictable. Its Lyapunov time is around 30 days. Hyperion, together with Pluto's moons Nix and Hydra, is among only a few moons in the Solar System known to rotate chaotically, although it is expected to be common in binary asteroids. It is also the only regular planetary natural satellite in the Solar System known not to be tidally locked. Hyperion is unique among the large moons in that it is very irregularly shaped, has a fairly eccentric orbit, and is near a much larger moon, Titan. These factors combine to restrict the set of conditions under which a stable rotation is possible. The 3:4 orbital resonance between Titan and Hyperion may also make a chaotic rotation more likely. The fact that its rotation is not locked probably accounts for the relative uniformity of Hyperion's surface, in contrast to many of Saturn's other moons, which have contrasting trailing and leading hemispheres.  Exploration  Hyperion has been imaged several times from moderate distances by the Cassini orbiter. The first close targeted flyby occurred at a distance of on 26 September 2005. Cassini made another close approach to Hyperion on 25 August 2011 when it passed from Hyperion, and third close approach was on 16 September 2011, with closest approach of . Cassini's last flyby was on 31 May 2015 at a distance of about .

They also functioned as watch towers where signal fires could be lit by the garrison to warn of approaching danger. The FISH Vocabulary Monument Types Thesaurus lists \\"pele\\" alongside \\"bastle\\", \\"fortified manor house\\" and \\"tower house\\" under the broader term \\"fortified house\\". Pevsner defines a peel as simply a stone tower. Outside of this, \\"peel\\" or \\"pele\\" can also be used in related contexts, for example a \\"pele\\" or \\"barmkin\\" (in Ireland a bawn) was an enclosure where livestock were herded in times of danger.Aslet & Powers, 20; Historic England The rustling of livestock was an inevitable part of Border raids, and often their main purpose.James, 16 In this usage, the tower usually stood at a corner of the pele. Most pele walls have not survived, and some towers perhaps never had them. Some, known as a \\"vicar's pele\\", were in villages for the use of the whole community.Aslet & Powers, 20  History  Peels were built in Scotland, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland and North Riding of Yorkshire, and as far south as Lancashire, in response to the threat of attack from the English, Scots and the Border Reivers of both nationalities. In Scotland, a line of these towers was built in the 1430s across the Tweed valley from Berwick to its source, as a response to the dangers of invasion from the Marches. In the upper Tweed valley, going downstream from its source, they were as follows: Fruid, Hawkshaw, Oliver, Polmood, Kingledoors, Mossfennan, Wrae Tower, Quarter, Stanhope, Drumelzier, Tinnies, Dreva, Stobo, Dawyck, Easter Happrew, Lyne, Barnes, Caverhill, Neidpath, Peebles, Horsburgh, Nether Horsburgh Castle, Cardrona, Kirna(Kirnie) Tower, Elibank. By an Act of the Parliament of England in 1455, each of these towers was required to have an iron basket on its summit and a smoke or fire signal, for day or night use, ready at hand.James, 19 Apart from their primary purpose as a warning system, these towers were also the homes of the lairds and landlords of the area, who dwelt in them with their families and retainers, while their followers lived in simple huts outside the walls. The towers also provided a refuge so that, when cross- border raiding parties arrived, the whole population of a village could take to the tower and wait for the marauders to depart.  Surviving towers  Hawkshaw, ancestral home of the Porteous family at Tweedsmuir in Peeblesshire, a peel tower dating from at least 1439, no longer stands but its site is marked by a cairn. Peel towers can be associated with a church: for example Embleton Tower in Embleton, Northumberland, is an example of a so-called vicar's pele and the one at Hulne Priory is in the grounds of the priory. St Michael's Church, Burgh by Sands has a heavily fortified tower at the west end and a former vicar's pele at the east end. St Cuthbert's, Great Salkeld, is another example. Some peels were converted to castles, such as Penrith Castle.Historic England Some towers are now derelict while others have been converted for use in peacetime. Embleton Tower is now part of the (former) vicarage and that on the Inner Farne is a home to bird wardens. The most obvious conversion needs include access, which would have originally been made intentionally difficult, and the provision of more and larger windows. A peel tower in Hellifield, North Yorkshire featured in an episode of Grand Designs showing the conversion from a derelict state to a home and a bed-and-breakfast business. Darnick Tower stands just outside Melrose and is still habitable. It was built in 1425 by the Heiton family from Normandy, and is considered one of the finest examples of a Borders peel tower. It had remained the property of the same family until 2016. Canons Ashby House incorporates one of only a few Peel towers constructed in the Midlands; it owes its existence to the settlement of Cumbrian sheep farmer, John Dryden, in the county of Northamptonshire.

It is based on the Titanomachia, and tells of the despair of the Titans after their fall to the Olympians. Keats wrote the poem from late 1818 until the spring of 1819, when he gave it up as having \\"too many Miltonic inversions.\\" He was also nursing his younger brother Tom, who died on 1 December 1818 of tuberculosis. The themes and ideas were picked up again in Keats's The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream, when he attempted to recast the epic by framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding. Plot The Titans are a pantheon of gods who ruled prior to the Olympians, and are now destined to fall. They include Saturn (king of the gods), Ops (his wife), Thea (his sister), Enceladus (god of war), (in Greek mythology, a Giant rather than a Titan), Oceanus (god of the sea), Hyperion (the god of the sun) and Clymene (a young goddess). The poem opens with Saturn bemoaning the loss of his power, which is being overtaken by Jupiter. Thea leads him to a place where the other Titans sit, similarly miserable, and they discuss whether they should fight back against their conquest by the new gods (the Olympians). Oceanus declares that he is willing to surrender his power to Neptune (the new god of the sea) because Neptune is more beautiful (this is worth bearing in mind in relation to the Romantic idea that beauty is paramount). Clymene describes first hearing the music of Apollo, which she found beautiful to the point of pain (another Romantic idea). Finally, Enceladus makes a speech encouraging the Titans to fight. Meanwhile, Hyperion's palace is described, and we first see Hyperion himself, the only Titan who is still powerful. He is addressed by Uranus (old god of the sky, father of Saturn), who encourages him to go to where Saturn and the other Titans are. We leave the Titans with the arrival of Hyperion, and the scene changes to Apollo (the new sun god, also god of music, civilisation and culture) weeping on the beach. Here Mnemosyne (goddess of memory) encounters him and he explains to her the cause of his tears: he is aware of his divine potential, but as yet unable to fulfill it. By looking into Mnemosyne's eyes he receives knowledge which transforms him fully into a god. The poem as usually printed breaks off at this point, in mid-line, with the word \\"celestial\\". Keats's friend Richard Woodhouse, transcribing this poem, completed this line as \\"Celestial Glory dawn'd: he was a god!\\"https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keats/john/hyperion/book3.html Style The language of Hyperion is very similar to Milton's, in meter and style.Bate, Walter Jackson. The Stylistic Development of Keats. New York: Humanities Press, 1962 However, his characters are quite different. Although Apollo falls into the image of the \\"Son\\" from Paradise Lost and of \\"Jesus\\" from Paradise Regained, he does not directly confront Hyperion as Satan is confronted. Also, the roles are reversed, and Apollo is deemed as the \\"challenger\\" to the throne, who wins it by being more \\"true\\" and thus, more \\"beautiful.\\" Extract From Book I, lines spoken by the Titan Hyperion: Later influence Hyperion has influenced a number of later works: * Dan Simmons's science fiction quartet, the Hyperion Cantos. * The cosmic metal band Keldian referenced the poem in the song \\"Hyperion\\" on the album Journey of Souls.

With his sister, the Titaness Theia, Hyperion fathered Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn).Morford, p. 40; Keightley, p. 47; Smith, \\"Hyperion\\"Hesiod.

John Keats's abandoned epic poem Hyperion is among the literary works that feature the figure.  Mythology  Hyperion's son Helios was referred to in early mythological writings as Helios Hyperion (, \\"Sun High-one\\"). In Homer's Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony, and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, the Sun is once in each work called Hyperionides (, \\"son of Hyperion\\"), and Hesiod certainly imagines Hyperion as a separate being in other writings. In later Greek literature, Hyperion is always distinguished from Helios; the former was ascribed the characteristics of the \\"God of Watchfulness, Wisdom and the Light\\", while the latter became the physical incarnation of the Sun. Hyperion is an obscure figure in Greek culture and mythology, mainly appearing in lists of the twelve Titans: > Of Hyperion we are told that he was the first to understand, by diligent > attention and observation, the movement of both the sun and the moon and the > other stars, and the seasons as well, in that they are caused by these > bodies, and to make these facts known to others; and that for this reason he > was called the father of these bodies, since he had begotten, so to speak, > the speculation about them and their nature. :‚Äî Diodorus Siculus (5.67.1) There is little to no reference to Hyperion during the Titanomachy, the epic in which the Olympians battle the ruling Titans. As the father of Helios, Hyperion was regarded as the ‚Äúfirst principle‚Äù by Emperor Julian, though his relevance in Julian's notions of theurgy is unknown.

The term originated in contrast to sheet film. Confusingly, roll film was originally often referred to as \\"cartridge\\" film because of its resemblance to a shotgun cartridge. The opaque backing paper allows roll film to be loaded in daylight. It is typically printed with frame number markings which can be viewed through a small red window at the rear of the camera. A spool of roll film is usually loaded on one side of the camera and pulled across to an identical take up spool on the other side of the shutter as exposures are made. When the roll is fully exposed, the take up spool is removed for processing and the empty spool on which the film was originally wound is moved to the other side, becoming the take up spool for the next roll of film. History Classic 120 negative roll film, manufactured by Agfa-Gevaert, with backing paper indicating total exposures available for 4.5√ó6, 6√ó6 and 6√ó9 cm camera film-frame sizes In 1881 a farmer in Cambria, Wisconsin, Peter Houston, invented the first roll film camera. His younger brother David, filed the patents for various components of Peter's camera. David Henderson Houston (born June 14, 1841; died May 6, 1906), originally from Cambria, Wisconsin, patented the first holders for flexible roll film. Houston moved to Hunter in Dakota Territory in 1880. He was issued an 1881 patent for a roll film holder US patent #248,179 for Photographic Apparatus is dated October 11, 1881; issued to David H. Houston of Cambria, WI. which he licensed to George Eastman (it was used in Eastman's Kodak 1888 box camera). Houston sold the patent (and an 1886 revision 1886 patent #355084) outright to Eastman for $5000 in 1889.Hammer, 1940, p.55. Houston continued developing the camera, creating 21 patents for cameras or camera parts between 1881 and 1902.Hammer, 1940, pp.55ff. In 1912 his estate transferred the remainder of his patents to Eastman. negative and transparency roll films The most popular roll film format is 120 film, which is used in most medium format cameras and roll film magazines for large-format cameras. Until the 1950s, 120 roll film was, with the smaller 127 film, also used in the simplest of box cameras and other snapshot cameras. The use of roll film in consumer cameras was largely superseded by 135 and 126 cartridges, but 120 and 220 (double length) film are still commonly used in medium format cameras. Automatic film speed sensing In 1998, Fujifilm introduced a film identification system for 120 and 220 format roll film called Barcode System (with logo \\"B\\"). The barcode encoding the film format and length as well as the film speed and type is located on the sticker between the emulsion carrying film and the backing paper. This 13-bit barcode is optically scanned by newer medium format cameras like the Fujifilm GA645i Professional, GA645Wi Professional, GA645Zi Professional, GX645AF Professional, GX680III Professional, GX680IIIS Professional, Hasselblad H1, H2, H2F and H3D Model I with HM 16-32 as well as by the Contax 645 AF.

The action was the culmination of a campaign that had criss-crossed the Bay of Biscay over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial, but inconclusive, fleet actions. The British Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe attempted to prevent the passage of a vital French grain convoy from the United States, which was protected by the French Atlantic Fleet, commanded by Rear-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse. The two forces clashed in the Atlantic Ocean, some west of the French island of Ushant on 1 June 1794. During the battle, Howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the French and for each of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent. This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains, and as a result his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered; in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe's fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies. The Glorious First of June demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the French and British navies at the start of the Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.  Background  Since early 1792 France had been at war with four of its neighbours on two fronts, battling the Habsburg monarchy and Prussia in the Austrian Netherlands, and the Austrians and Piedmontese in Italy. On 2 January 1793, almost one year into the French Revolutionary War, republican-held forts at Brest in Brittany fired on the British brig HMS Childers. A few weeks later, following the execution of the imprisoned King Louis XVI,Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 9 diplomatic ties between Britain and France were broken. On 1 February, France declared war on both Britain and the Dutch Republic. Protected from immediate invasion by the English Channel, Britain prepared for an extensive naval campaign and dispatched troops to the Netherlands for service against the French.Padfield, p. 15 Throughout the remainder of 1793, the British and French navies undertook minor operations in Northern waters, the Mediterranean and the West and East Indies, where both nations maintained colonies. The closest the Channel Fleet had come to an engagement was when it had narrowly missed intercepting the French convoy from the Caribbean, escorted by 15 ships of the line on 2 August.Mostert, p. 102 The only major clash was the Siege of Toulon, a confused and bloody affair in which the British force holding the town‚Äîalongside Spanish, Sardinian, Austrian and French Royalist troops‚Äîhad to be evacuated by the Royal Navy to prevent its imminent defeat at the hands of the French Republican army.Tracy, p. 27 The aftermath of this siege was punctuated by recriminations and accusations of cowardice and betrayal among the allies, eventually resulting in Spain switching allegiance with the signing of the Treaty of San Ildefonso two years later.Williams, p. 387 Nevertheless, the siege produced one major success: Sir Sidney Smith, with parties of sailors from the retreating British fleet, accomplished the destruction of substantial French naval stores and shipping in Toulon.Williams, p. 373 More might have been achieved had the Spanish raiding parties that accompanied Smith not been issued with secret orders to stall the destruction of the French fleet.Tracy, p. 53 The situation in Europe remained volatile into 1794. Off northern France, the French Atlantic Fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay. In consequence, the French Navy officer corps suffered greatly from the effects of the Reign of Terror, with many experienced sailors being executed, imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty.James, p. 122 The shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though; France itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest. By this time at war with all her neighbours, France had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions. Eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the National Convention: food produced in France's overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in Chesapeake Bay, and augmented with food and goods purchased from the United States.Tracy, p. 89 During April and May 1794, the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the Atlantic to Brest, protected by elements of the French Atlantic Fleet.Mostert, p. 132 Fleets The navies of Britain and France in 1794 were at very different stages of development. Although the British fleet was numerically superior, the French ships were larger and stronger, and carried a heavier weight of shot. The largest French ships were three-decker first rates, carrying 110 or 120 guns, against 100 guns on the largest British vessels. =Royal Navy= Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe; 1794 painting by John Singleton Copley Since the Spanish Armament of 1790, the Royal Navy had been at sea in a state of readiness for over three years.James, p. 48 The Navy's dockyards under First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict. This was quite unlike the disasters of the American Revolutionary War ten years earlier, when an ill- prepared Royal Navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the North American campaign‚Äîwhich ended in defeat at the Battle of Yorktown due to lack of supplies.Rodger, p. 429 With British dockyards now readily turning out cannon, shot, sails, provisions and other essential equipment, the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the Navy list. Unfortunately for the British, gathering sufficient manpower was difficult and never satisfactorily accomplished throughout the entire war. The shortage of seamen was such that press gangs were forced to take thousands of men with no experience on the sea, meaning that training and preparing them for naval life would take quite some time. The lack of Royal Marines was even more urgent, and soldiers from the British Army were drafted into the fleet for service at sea. Men of the 2nd.

George Montagu, in HMS Hector, was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard British convoys to the East Indies, West Indies and Newfoundland as far as Cape Finisterre. Peter Rainier, in HMS Suffolk and commanding six other ships, was to escort the convoys for the rest of their passage. The third force consisted of 26 ships of the line, with several supporting vessels, under Howe's direct command. They were to patrol the Bay of Biscay for the arriving French.James, p. 125 =French Navy= Gu√©rin In contrast to their British counterparts, the French Navy was in a state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier.Jane, p. 94 Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts‚Äîmany of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel‚Äîfilled the Atlantic fleet.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 16 The manpower problem was compounded by the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation, with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times.James, p. 58 In August 1793, these problems came to a head in the fleet off Brest, when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors. The crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food, leaving the French coast undefended.James, p. 59 The National Convention responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship's non- commissioned officers. Hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned, banished or dismissed from naval service. The effect of this purge was devastating, seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel. In their places were promoted junior officers, merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal, although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea.Padfield, p. 13 The newly appointed commander of this troubled fleet was Villaret de Joyeuse; although formerly in a junior position, he was known to possess a high degree of tactical ability;Jane, p. 96 he had trained under Admiral Pierre Andr√© de Suffren in the Indian Ocean during the American war.Mosert, p. 133 However, Villaret's attempts to mould his new officer corps into an effective fighting unit were hampered by another new appointee, a deputy of the National Convention named Jean-Bon Saint-Andr√©. Saint-Andr√©'s job was to report directly to the National Convention on the revolutionary ardour of both the fleet and its admiral. He frequently intervened in strategic planning and tactical operations.James, p. 123 Shortly after his arrival, Saint-Andr√© proposed issuing a decree ordering that any officer deemed to have shown insufficient zeal in defending his ship in action should be put to death on his return to France, although this highly controversial legislation does not appear to have ever been acted upon. Although his interference was a source of frustration for Villaret, Saint-Andr√©'s dispatches to Paris were published regularly in Le Moniteur, and did much to popularise the Navy in France.James, p. 124 The French Atlantic fleet was even more dispersed than the British in the spring of 1794: Rear-Admiral Pierre Vanstabel had been dispatched, with five ships including two of the line, to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard. Rear-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly had sailed from Rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid-Atlantic. This left Villaret with 25 ships of the line at Brest to meet the threat posed by the British fleet under Lord Howe. =Convoy= By early spring of 1794, the situation in France was dire. With famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance. Turning to France's colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, where Admiral Vanstabel would wait for them. According to contemporary historian William James this conglomeration of ships was said to be over 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).James, p. 127 The convoy had also been augmented by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the American Revolution. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the American government, urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France.Williams, p. 381 Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the Quasi War.Gardiner, Nelson Against Napoleon, p. 148 May 1794 The French convoy, escorted by Vanstabel, departed America from Virginia on 2 April, and Howe sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May, taking his entire fleet to both escort British convoys to the Western Approaches and intercept the French. Checking that Villaret was still in Brest, Howe spent two weeks searching the Bay of Biscay for the grain convoy, returning to Brest on 18 May to discover that Villaret had sailed the previous day. Returning to sea in search of his opponent, Howe pursued Villaret deep into the Atlantic. Also at sea during this period were the squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British), both of whom had met with some success; Nielly had captured a number of British merchant ships and Montagu had taken several back. Nielly was the first to encounter the grain convoy, deep in the Atlantic in the second week of May. He took it under escort as it moved closer to Europe, while Montagu was searching fruitlessly to the south.James, p. 128 Despite Howe's pursuit, the main French sortie found initial success, running into a Dutch convoy and taking 20 ships from it on Villaret's first day at sea. For the next week Howe continued to follow the French, seizing and burning a trail of French-held Dutch ships and enemy corvettes.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 27 On 25 May Howe spotted a straggler from Villaret's fleet and gave chase; Audacieux led Howe straight to his opponent's location.James, p. 130 Having finally found Villaret, on 28 May Howe attacked, using a flying squadron of his fastest ships to cut off its rearmost vessel R√©volutionnaire. This first rate was at various times engaged with six British ships and took heavy damage, possibly striking her colours late in the action.James, p. 132 As darkness fell the British and French fleets separated, leaving R√©volutionnaire and her final enemy, HMS Audacious, still locked in combat behind them. These two ships parted company during the night and eventually returned to their respective home ports.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 28 By this stage Villaret knew through his patrolling frigates that the grain convoy was close, and deliberately took his fleet to the west, hoping to decoy Howe away from the vital convoy. Taking the bait, the following day Howe attacked again, but his attempt to split the French fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship, HMS Caesar, failed to follow orders.James, p. 138 Much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive, and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue. Howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage, enabling him to further attack Villaret at a time of his choosing. Three French ships were sent back to port with damage, but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained the following day with the arrival of Nielly's detached squadron.Padfield, p. 16 Battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog, but when the haze lifted on 1 June 1794, the battle lines were only 6 miles (10 km) apart and Howe was prepared to force a decisive action.  First of June  The British and French fleets on the morning of 1 June 1794James p.147 Although Howe was in a favourable position, Villaret had not been idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was within a few hours of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of his position on the weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6 km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands.Jane, p. 95 The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.James, p. 146 It was normal in fleet actions of the 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy.Padfield, p. 18 In contrast, Howe was counting on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with the advantage of the weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters, each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12 years earlier).Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 31 Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat downwind, and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet. British break the line Within minutes of issuing the signal and turning his flagship HMS Queen Charlotte, Howe's plan began to falter. Many of the British captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging back in the original line.Padfield, p. 22 Other ships were still struggling with damage from Howe's earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough. The result was a ragged formation tipped by Queen Charlotte that headed unevenly for Villaret's fleet. The French responded by firing on the British ships as they approached, but the lack of training and coordination in the French fleet was obvious; many ships which did obey Howe's order and attacked the French directly arrived in action without significant damage. =Van squadron= HMS Defence at the Battle of the Glorious 1 June 1794, Nicholas Pocock Although Queen Charlotte pressed on all sail, she was not the first through the enemy line. That distinction belonged to a ship of the van squadron under Admiral Graves: HMS Defence under Captain James Gambier, a notoriously dour officer nicknamed \\"Dismal Jimmy\\" by his contemporaries.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 32 Defence, the seventh ship of the British line, successfully cut the French line between its sixth and seventh ships; Mucius and Tourville. Raking both opponents, Defence soon found herself in difficulty due to the failure of those ships behind her to properly follow up.James, p. 158 This left her vulnerable to Mucius, Tourville and the ships following them, with which she began a furious fusillade. However, Defence was not the only ship of the van to break the French line; minutes later George Cranfield Berkeley in HMS Marlborough executed Howe's manoeuvre perfectly, raking and then entangling his ship with Imp√©tueux.Padfield, p. 29James, p. 157 In front of Marlborough the rest of the van had mixed success. HMS Bellerophon and HMS Leviathan were both still suffering the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the near side of √âole and America respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley of Bellerophon was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. HMS Royal Sovereign, Graves's flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent Terrible. In the time it took to engage Terrible more closely, Royal Sovereign suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded. More disturbing to Lord Howe were the actions of HMS Russell and HMS Caesar. Russell's captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get to grips with the enemy more closely and allowing her opponent T√©m√©raire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action. There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of Caesar, who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly.Padfield, p. 24 Caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship Trajan but her fire had little effect, while Trajan inflicted much damage to Caesar's rigging and was subsequently able to attack Bellerophon as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing at the head of the line.James, p. 155 =Centre= The centre of the two fleets was divided by two separate squadrons of the British line: the forward division under admirals Benjamin Caldwell and George Bowyer and the rear under Lord Howe. While Howe in Queen Charlotte was engaging the French closely, his subordinates in the forward division were less active. Instead of moving in on their opposite numbers directly, the forward division sedately closed with the French in line ahead formation, engaging in a long distance duel which did not prevent their opponents from harassing the embattled Defence just ahead of them. Of all the ships in this squadron only HMS Invincible, under Thomas Pakenham, ranged close to the French lines. Invincible was badly damaged by her lone charge but managed to engage the larger Juste.James, p. 159 HMS Barfleur under Bowyer did later enter the action, but Bowyer was not present, having lost a leg in the opening exchanges. Howe and Queen Charlotte led the fleet by example, sailing directly at the French flagship Montagne. Passing between Montagne and the next in line Vengeur du Peuple, Queen Charlotte raked both and hauled up close to Montagne to engage in a close-range artillery battle. As she did so, Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships. To the right of Queen Charlotte, HMS Brunswick had initially struggled to join the action. Labouring behind the flagship, her captain John Harvey received a rebuke from Howe for the delay. Spurred by this signal, Harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped Queen Charlotte, blocking her view of the eastern half of the French fleet for a time and taking severe damage from French fire as she did so. Harvey hoped to run aboard Jacobin and support his admiral directly, but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between Achille and Vengeur du Peuple. This manoeuvre failed when Brunswick's anchors became entangled in Vengeur's rigging. Harvey's master asked if Vengeur should be cut loose, to which Harvey replied \\"No; we have got her and we will keep her\\". The two ships swung so close to each other that Brunswick's crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids, the ships battering each other from a distance of just a few feet.James, p. 161 Behind this combat, other ships of the centre division struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion and unable to take their ship into battle.James, p. 165 Valiant instead turned her attention on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded.Padfield, p. 31 Both ships bore down on the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely. =Rear= Of the British rear ships, only two made a determined effort to break the French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between R√©publicain and Sans Pareil, engaging both closely, while HMS Glory came through the line behind Sans Pareil and threw herself into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard did not participate in this close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely,James, p. 167 although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly.Donnelly, Sir Ross, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton and Andrew Lambert, (subscription required), Retrieved 10 May 2012 Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in the confused action around Queen Charlotte.James, p. 163 Three other British ships failed to respond to the signal from Howe, including HMS Alfred which engaged the French line at extreme range without noticeable effect, and Captain Charles Cotton in HMS Majestic who likewise did little until the action was decided, at which point he took the surrender of several already shattered French ships. Finally HMS Thunderer under Albemarle Bertie took no part in the initial action at all, standing well away from the British line and failing to engage the enemy despite the signal for close engagement hanging limply from her mainmast. The French rear ships were no less idle, with Entreprenant and Pelletier firing at any British ships in range but refusing to close or participate in the melees on either side. The French rear ship Scipion did not attempt to join the action either, but could not avoid becoming embroiled in the group around Royal George and R√©publicain and suffered severe damage.James, p. 168 Melee Vengeur du Peuple in the aftermath of battle. Lithograph after Auguste Mayer. Within an hour of their opening volleys the British and French lines were hopelessly confused, with three separate engagements being fought within sight of one another. In the van, Caesar had finally attempted to join the fight, only to have a vital spar shot away by Trajan which caused her to slip down the two embattled fleets without contributing significantly to the battle.James, p. 154 Bellerophon and Leviathan were in the thick of the action, the outnumbered Bellerophon taking serious damage to her rigging. This left her unable to manoeuvre and in danger from her opponents, of which Eole also suffered severely. Captain William Johnstone Hope sought to extract his ship from her perilous position and called up support; the frigate HMS Latona under Captain Edward Thornbrough arrived to provide assistance. Thornbrough brought his small ship between the ships of the French battleline and opened fire on Eole, helping to drive off three ships of the line and then towing Bellerophon to safety. Leviathan, under Lord Hugh Seymour, had been more successful than Bellerophon, her gunnery dismasting America despite receiving fire from Eole and Trajan in passing. Leviathan only left America after a two-hour duel, sailing at 11:50 to join Queen Charlotte in the centre.James, p. 156 Russell had not broken the French line and her opponent T√©meraire got the better of her, knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with Trajan and Eole. Russell then fired on several passing French ships before joining Leviathan in attacking the centre of the French line. Russell's boats also took the surrender of America, her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize (although later replaced by men from Royal Sovereign).Tracy, p. 98, Biographical Memoir of Rear-Admiral John Willett Payne Royal Sovereign lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as Terrible fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line on the far side of the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship Montagne, which had escaped from Queen Charlotte, and it was Montagne which Royal Sovereign engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by Valiant, and beginning a long-range action. Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, inextricably tangled with Imp√©tueux. Badly damaged and on the verge of surrender, Imp√©tueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships.Padfield, p. 33 The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Imp√©tueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. Imp√©tueux was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell. Dismasted, Defence was unable to hold any of her various opponents to a protracted duel, and by 13:00 was threatened by the damaged R√©publicain moving from the east. Although R√©publicain later hauled off to join Villaret to the north, Gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet's frigates and was aided by HMS Phaeton under Captain William Bentinck. As Imp√©tueux passed she fired on Phaeton, to which Bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own. Invincible, the only ship of the forward division of the British centre to engage the enemy closely, became embroiled in the confusion surrounding Queen Charlotte. Invincible's guns drove Juste onto the broadside of Queen Charlotte, where she was forced to surrender to Lieutenant Henry Blackwood in a boat from Invincible. Among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties, although HMS Impregnable lost several yards and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers, Lieutenant Robert Otway and Midshipman Charles Dashwood.Otway, Sir Robert, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 2 January 2008 Lord Howe on the deck of HMS Queen Charlotte 1 June 1794, painted by Mather Brown. The conflict between Queen Charlotte and Montagne was oddly one- sided, the French flagship failing to make use of her lower-deck guns and consequently suffering extensive damage and casualties. Queen Charlotte in her turn was damaged by fire from nearby ships and was therefore unable to follow when Montagne set her remaining sails and slipped to the north to create a new focal point for the survivors of the French fleet.James, p. 149 Queen Charlotte also took fire during the engagement from HMS Gibraltar, under Thomas Mackenzie, which had failed to close with the enemy and instead fired at random into the smoke bank surrounding the flagship. Captain Sir Andrew Snape Douglas was seriously wounded by this fire.Padfield, p. 32 Following Montagne's escape, Queen Charlotte engaged Jacobin and R√©publicain as they passed, and was successful in forcing the surrender of Juste. To the east of Queen Charlotte, Brunswick and Vengeur du Peuple continued their bitter combat, locked together and firing main broadsides from point blank range. Captain Harvey of Brunswick was mortally wounded early in this action by langrage fire from Vengeur, but refused to quit the deck, ordering more fire into his opponent.Harvey, John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 24 December 2007 Brunswick also managed to drive Achille off from her far side when the French ship attempted to intervene. Achille, already damaged, was totally dismasted in the exchange and briefly surrendered, although her crew rescinded this when it became clear Brunswick was in no position to take possession. With her colours rehoisted, Achille then made what sail she could in an attempt to join Villaret to the north. It was not until 12:45 that the shattered Vengeur and Brunswick pulled apart, both largely dismasted and very battered. Brunswick was only able to return to the British side of the line after being supported by Ramillies, while Vengeur was unable to move at all.Padfield, p. 37 Ramillies took Vengeur's surrender after a brief cannonade but was unable to board her and instead pursued the fleeing Achille, which soon surrendered as well. To the east, Orion and Queen forced the surrender of both Northumberland and Jemmappes, although Queen was unable to secure Jemmappes and she had to be abandoned later. Queen especially was badly damaged and unable to make the British lines again, wallowing between the newly reformed French fleet and the British battleline along with several other shattered ships.Tracy, p. 99, Biographical Memoir of Captain James Manderson Royal George and Glory had between them disabled Scipion and Sans Pareil in a bitter exchange, but were also too badly damaged themselves to take possession. All four ships were among those left drifting in the gap between the fleets. French recovery Villaret's Montagne breaking loose to reform the French forces. Drawing by Antoine Morel-Fatio. Villaret in Montagne, having successfully broken contact with the British flagship and slipped away to the north, managed to gather 11 ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron. At 11:30, with the main action drawing to a close, he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered. Aiming his new squadron at the battered Queen, Villaret's attack created consternation in the British fleet, which was unprepared for a second engagement.Padfield, p. 38 However, discerning Villaret's intention, Howe also pulled his ships together to create a new force. His reformed squadron consisted of Queen Charlotte, Royal Sovereign, Valiant, Leviathan, Barfleur, and Thunderer.James, p. 151 Howe deployed this squadron in defence of Queen, and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 38 Villaret was subsequently joined by the battered Terrible, which sailed straight through the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines, and he also recovered the dismasted Scipion, Mucius, Jemmappes, and R√©publicain‚Äîall of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships‚Äîbefore turning eastwards towards France.James, p. 169 At this stage of the battle, Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his Captain of the Fleet, Sir Roger Curtis. Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the dismasted French ships, and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit. The sinking of the Vengeur du Peuple, engraving by P. Ozanne. The sinking of the Vengeur du Peuple, haut relief by L√©opold Morice, Monument to the Republic, Paris, 1883. In fact, the British fleet was unable to pursue Villaret, having only 11 ships still capable of battle to the French 12, and having numerous dismasted ships and prizes to protect. Retiring and regrouping, the British crews set about making hasty repairs and securing their prizes; seven in total, including the badly damaged Vengeur du Peuple. Vengeur had been holed by cannon firing from Brunswick directly through the ship's bottom, and after her surrender no British ship had managed to get men aboard. This left Vengeur's few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could‚Äîa task made harder when some of her sailors broke into the spirit room and became drunk. Ultimately the ship's pumps became unmanageable, and Vengeur began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged Alfred and HMS Culloden, as well as the services of the cutter HMS Rattler, saved any of the Vengeur's crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 33 Lieutenant John Winne of Rattler was especially commended for this hazardous work.James, p. 164 By 18:15, Vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded, the dead, and the drunk remained aboard. Several sailors are said to have waved the tricolor from the bow of the ship and cried \\"Vive la Nation, vive la R√©publique!\\" Having escaped to the east, Villaret made what sail his battered fleet could muster to return to France, and dispatched his frigates in search of the convoy. Villaret was also hoping for reinforcements; eight ships of the line, commanded by Admiral Pierre-Fran√ßois Cornic, were patrolling near the Ushant headland. Behind him to the west, the British took the whole night to secure their ships and prizes, not setting out to return to Britain until 05:00 on 2 June. Casualties in the battle are notoriously hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-Andr√© and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither of which can be treated as completely reliable.James, p. 153 Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000 captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200. Convoy arrives Howe failed to achieve the broader strategic aim of intercepting a vital grain convoy bound for the famine-ridden French populace. With a large portion of his fleet no longer battleworthy, Howe was unable to resume his search for the French convoy in the Bay of Biscay. The Admiralty, though unaware of Howe's specific circumstances, knew a battle had taken place through the arrival of HMS Audacious in Portsmouth, and was preparing a second expedition under George Montagu. Montagu had returned to England after his unsuccessful May cruise, and was refitting in Portsmouth when ordered to sea again. His force of ten ships was intended to both cover Howe's withdrawal from Biscay, and find and attack the French grain convoy. Montagu returned to sea on 3 June, and by 8 June was off Ushant searching for signs of either the French or Howe; unknown to him, neither had yet entered European waters. At 15:30 on 8 June Montagu spotted sails, and soon identified them as the enemy. He had located Cornic's squadron, which was also patrolling for the convoy and the returning fleets. Montagu gave chase and drove Cornic into Bertheaume Bay, where he blockaded the French squadron overnight, hoping to bring them to action the following day.James, p. 171 However, on 9 June, Montagu sighted 19 French ships appearing from the west‚Äîthe remnants of Villaret's fleet. Hastily turning his ships, Montagu sailed south to avoid becoming trapped between two forces which might easily overwhelm him.Williams, p. 382 Villaret and Cornic gave chase for a day before turning east towards the safety of the French ports. Howe benefited from Montagu's withdrawal, as his own battered fleet passed close to the scene of this stand-off on 10 June, pushing north into the English Channel. With Villaret and Cornic fortuitously pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant without difficulty and arrived off Plymouth on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day before, but Saint- Andr√© refused to allow him to enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town's population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy from America finally arrived off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.James, p. 172 Aftermath Both Britain and France claimed victory in the battle: Britain by virtue of capturing or sinking seven French ships without losing any of her own and remaining in control of the battle site; France because the vital convoy had passed through the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism‚Äîthe latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting.James, p. 173 The British fleet in Spithead was treated with a Royal visit by King George III and the entire royal household.Tracy, p. 99, The Biographical memoir of Lord Howe =France= In France the revolutionary principles of precluded extensive awards, but Villaret was promoted to vice-admiral on 27 September 1794Levot, p.544 and other minor awards were distributed to the admirals of the fleet. In addition the fleet's officers took part in a celebratory parade from Brest to Paris, accompanying the recently arrived food supplies. The role of Vengeur du Peuple was mythified by Bertrand Barr√®re, giving birth to an exalted legend. Opinion in France concerning the battle's outcome was divided; while many celebrated Saint-Andr√©'s exaggerated accounts of victory in Le Moniteur, senior naval officers disagreed.James, p. 174 Among the dissenters was the highly experienced but recently dismissed Admiral Kerguelen. Kerguelen was disgusted by Villaret's failure to renew the battle after he had reformed his squadron, and felt that the French fleet could have been successful tactically as well as strategically if only Villaret had made greater efforts to engage the remains of Howe's fleet.James, p. 175 The French Navy had suffered its worst losses in a single day since the Battle of La Hogue in 1692. Ultimately the revolutionary excesses of the period would prove disastrous for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure at the hands of more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20 years earlier.Padfield, p. 163 =Britain= The celebrated victory obtained by the British Fleet under the Command of Earl Howe, over The French Fleet on The Glorious First of June, 1794, Daniel Orme, 1795. 1802 engraving commemorating the Glorious First of June. French cannon, captured by Lord Howe, now on display at Royal Arsenal, Woolwich In Britain, numerous honours were bestowed on the fleet and its commanders. Admiral Howe, already an earl, refused any further elevation, and one of Howe's political opponents dissuaded King George III from making him a Knight of the Garter. Vice-Admiral Graves was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Graves, while Vice-Admiral Hood was made Viscount Bridport. Rear-Admirals Bowyer, Gardner, Pasley and Curtis (the last-named was promoted from captain on 4 July 1794) were all made baronets, and Bowyer and Pasley also received pensions of ¬£1,000 a year to compensate them for their severe wounds.James, p. 179 All first lieutenants were promoted to commander and numerous other officers were promoted in consequence of their actions. The thanks of parliament were unanimously passed to all who fought at the action and various other gifts and awards were distributed among the fleet. A memorial to Captains John Hutt and John Harvey, both of whom had died of their wounds on 30 June, was raised in Westminster Abbey. There was, however, a bitter consequence of the awards, rooted in Howe's official dispatch to the Admiralty concerning the battle, which according to some accounts was actually written by Curtis. Howe had appended a list to his report containing the names of officers whom he believed merited special reward for their part in the battle. The list included Vice-Admirals Graves and Hood, Rear-Admirals Bowyer, Gardner, and Pasley, and Captains Seymour, Pakenham, Cranfield Berkeley, Gambier, John Harvey, Payne, Henry Harvey, Pringle, Duckworth, Elphinstone, Nichols, and Hope. Also mentioned were Lieutenants Monkton and Donnelly.James, p. 181 The list had omitted a number of officers who had served in the battle, and the justice of their omission was a highly controversial issue in the Navy.Tracy, p. 90 Rear-Admiral Caldwell was the sole British flag officer present not to receive a hereditary honour, although he was promoted to Vice- Admiral on 4 July (as were Bowyer and Gardner). After studying the ship's logs and reports of the battle, the Admiralty minted a medal to be awarded to the living captains on the list only (although Captain William Parker of HMS Audacious was awarded one as well). The captains excluded from the list were furious, and the furor from this selective commendation lasted years: in 1795 Vice-Admiral Caldwell quit the service in anger as a result,Caldwell, Sir Benjamin, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 8 December 2007 while Cuthbert Collingwood, flag captain of Barfleur, refused all awards for future service until the Glorious First of June medal was presented to him as well. He eventually received it after the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797.Collingwood, Cuthbert, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, C. H. H. Owen, Retrieved 31 December 2007 Over five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. Bitterest of all was the whispering campaign directed at Anthony Molloy, captain of HMS Caesar. Molloy was accused of cowardice by fellow officers for his failure to follow Howe's orders on both 29 May and 1 June. Molloy's request for an official court-martial to clear his name failed, and although his personal courage was not called into question, his professional ability was.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 39 Molloy was dismissed from his ship.Brenton, The Naval History of Great Britain, p. 227 Of the captured ships, several were purchased and enjoyed long careers in the Royal Navy, in particular the two 80-gun ships HMS Sans Pareil, which was decommissioned in 1802 but not broken up until 1842, and HMS Juste, which was a popular command until her decommissioning in 1802 at the Peace of Amiens.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 41 Of the four 74-gun prizes, Achille and Northumberland (both 74s built in the late 1770s) were broken up as unserviceable soon after arrival in Britain, while Imp√©tueux was destroyed in a dockyard fire on 24 August 1794 while undergoing repairs.

Medium-format film lacks the sprocket holes of 35-mm film. Medium format has traditionally referred to a film format in still photography and the related cameras and equipment that use film. Nowadays, the term applies to film and digital cameras that record images on media larger than (full-frame) (used in 35 mm () photography), but smaller than (which is considered to be large format photography). In digital photography, medium format refers either to cameras adapted from medium-format film photography uses or to cameras making use of sensors larger than that of a 35 mm film frame. Often, medium-format film cameras can be retrofitted with digital camera backs, converting them to digital cameras, but some of these digital backs, especially early models, use sensors smaller than a 35 mm film frame. As of 2013, medium-format digital photography sensors were available in sizes of up to 40.3 by 53.7 mm, with 60 million pixels for use with commonly available professional medium-format cameras. Sensors used in special applications such as spy satellites can be even larger but are not necessarily described as medium-format equipment. In the film world, medium format has moved from being the most widely used film size (the 1900s through 1950s) to a niche used by professionals and some amateur enthusiasts, but one which is still substantially more popular than large format. In digital photography, medium format has been a very expensive option, with lower-cost options such as the Fujifilm GFX 50R still retailing for $4,500. While at one time a variety of medium-format film sizes were produced, today the vast majority of the medium-format film is produced in the 6 cm 120 and 220 sizes. Other sizes are mainly produced for use in antique cameras, and many people assume 120/220 film is being referred to when the term medium format is used. The general rule with consumer cameras‚Äîas opposed to specialized industrial, scientific, and military equipment‚Äîis the more cameras sold, the more sophisticated the automation features available. Medium-format cameras made since the 1950s are generally less automated than smaller cameras made at the same time, having high image quality as their primary advantage. For example, autofocus became available in consumer 35 mm cameras in 1977, but did not reach medium format until the late 1990s, and has never been available in a consumer large format camera. Characteristics The main benefit of medium-format photography is that, because of the larger size of the film or digital sensor (two to six times larger than 35 mm), images of much higher resolution can be produced. This allows for bigger enlargements and smooth gradation without the grain or blur that would characterize similarly enlarged images produced from smaller film formats. The larger size of the film also allows for better control of the depth of field and therefore more photographic creativity. Cameras with a bellows typically support 'tilt and shift' of the lens. This permits landscape photography with the appearance of an extremely large depth of field ‚Äî from closest foreground to the far horizon ‚Äî to be achieved, by aligning the plane of focus with the subject plane of interest, using the Scheimpflug principle. Compared with 35 mm, the main drawbacks are accessibility and price. While 35-mm cameras, film, and photo finishing services are generally widely available and cheap, medium format is usually limited to professional photography shops and can be prohibitively expensive. Also, medium-format cameras tend to be bulkier than their 35mm counterpart. =Film handling= The medium-format film is usually roll film, typically allowing 8 to 32 exposures on one roll of film before reloading is needed. This is fewer than 35 mm cartridges, which typically take 12 to 36 pictures on one roll. This is somewhat offset by the fact that most medium-format systems used interchangeable film magazines, thereby allowing photographers to switch rolls quickly, allowing them larger numbers of exposures before needing to load new film or to change the film type. Some companies had bulk film backs that used 70mm double-perforated film that allowed up to 75 feet of film to be loaded at one time. While rolls of large format film were produced at one time, their use was specialized, typically for aerial cameras installed in military aircraft or printing industry equipment. Most large format film is sheet film, that is, film where each picture is on a separate piece of film, requiring that the camera be frequently reloaded, usually after every picture, sometimes using magazines of up to five pictures or reduction backs that allow multiple pictures on a single sheet of film. Medium-format sheet film was produced for some cameras, but these cameras tend to be smaller, lighter, and easier to use than large format gear. Sheet film was never commonly used in cameras smaller than medium format. Film cost per exposure is directly related to the amount of film used, thus, the larger the film size, the more expensive each picture will be. An 8\\" by 10\\" large format negative is far more expensive than a 6 by 6 cm medium- format picture, which is substantially more expensive than a frame of 35 mm film. 35 mm cartridges are generally easier to load and unload from a camera than medium-format rolls. A 35 mm cartridge is placed inside a camera, and in most motorized cameras this is all that is needed; the camera loads the film and rewinds it into the cartridge for removal. Far fewer medium-format cameras are motorized, and medium-format roll film does not have sprocket holes, so loading often requires that marking on the backing paper of the film be lined up with markings on the camera, and on unloading, the backing paper must be carefully secured to protect the film from light. =120, 220 and 620 film= SLR camera with perspective control lens All medium-format cameras mass- produced today (as of 2012) use the 120 film format. Additionally, many are capable of using the 220 film format, effectively doubling the number of frames available with 120 film. Medium-format roll film is still available from specialty shops and photographic laboratories, yet it is not as ubiquitous as 135 (35mm) film. The 620 format was introduced by Kodak in 1931 as an alternative to 120. It was discontinued in 1995. The 620 format is essentially the same film on a thinner and narrower all-metal spool. While 620 film is required on a number of old Kodak Brownie cameras, many of these cameras can accommodate the slightly larger 120 rolls/spools. In other situations where the camera cannot accommodate a 120 spool, the 120 film can be rolled onto a 620 spool in a darkroom or changing bag. This film is shot in a variety of aspect ratios, which differ depending on the camera or frame insert used. The most common aspect ratios are 6√ó6 cm (square/1:1) and 6√ó4.5 cm (rectangular/4:3). Other frequently used aspect ratios are 6√ó7 cm, 6√ó9 cm, and 6√ó17 cm panoramic. The 6√ó4.5 cm format is usually referred to as \\"645\\", with many cameras that use this ratio bearing \\"645\\" in their product name. Cameras that can switch to different aspect ratios do so by either switching camera backs, by using a frame insert, or by use of special multi-format backs. All of these dimensions are nominal; actual dimensions are a bit different. For example, 6√ó7 cm might give an image on film that is actually 56√ó70 mm; this enlarges exactly to fill an 8√ó10 sheet of paper. Another feature of many medium-format models is the ability to use Polaroid instant film in an interchangeable back. Studio, commercial and architectural photographers value this system for its ability to verify the focus and exposure. =70 mm film ‚Äî still versus cine= For some professional medium- format cameras, those used in school portraiture for example, long-roll film magazines were available. Most of these accommodated rolls of film that were 100 ft (30.5 m) long and 70 mm wide, sometimes with perforations, sometimes without. Some cameras, such as the Hasselblad, could be equipped with film magazines holding 15 foot rolls of double perforated 70mm film passed between two cassettes. 70 mm was a standard roll film width for many decades, last used as late as the 1960s for 116 and 616 size roll films. It was also used for aerial photo-mapping, and it is still used by large format cinema systems such as IMAX. 70mm film used in still cameras, like Mamiya and Hasselblad, and 70mm print film used in IMAX projectors have the same gauge or height as 120 film. With 70mm cine projector film, the perforations are inset by 2.5mm to make room for the old-style optical sound tracks; a standard established by Todd-AO in the 1950s. IMAX cameras use 65mm film, which have perforations and pitch that match-up to the 70mm film used in IMAX projectors.

Like most 35 mm SLRs, these cameras usually support different lenses, but in addition it is also standard for medium-format system cameras to support different winding mechanisms, viewfinders, and camera backs. This flexibility is one of the primary advantages of medium-format photography.  Digital medium format  Digital photography came to the medium-format world with the development of digital camera backs, which can be fitted to many system cameras. Digital backs are a type of camera back that have electronic sensors in them, effectively converting a camera into a digital camera. These backs are used predominantly by professional photographers. As with film, due to the increased size of the imaging chip (up to twice that of a 35 mm film frame, and thus as much as 40 times the size of the chip in a typical pocket point- and-shoot camera) they deliver more pixels than consumer-grade cameras, and have lower noise. Features like fan cooling also improve the image quality of studio models. This market began in 1992 when Leaf Systems Inc. released their first digital camera back (4 Megapixels), named the \\"DCB\\" (often described as 'a brick'). Initially mounted on Sinar Studio cameras, the camera backs were later moved to medium-format units. By the late 1990s, a number of companies produced digital camera backs of various types. In the 2000s, the number of vendors of both high-end medium-format camera systems and digital backs began to decrease. The performance of digital SLRs cut into the sale of film-based medium-format systems, while the tremendous development expenses for medium- format digital systems meant that not all vendors could profitably compete. Contax and Bronica ceased production of cameras, Kodak stopped making their DCS series of backs, and camera and back manufacturers began to integrate. Camera maker Hasselblad merged with digital imaging firm Imacon and partnered with Fuji to design and produce a new line of digital-friendly medium-format cameras, the H-Series. Since the manufacturer plans to sell digital backs integrated with the camera, other makers of digital backs are far less likely to be able to sell backs for this camera. Camera maker Mamiya developed the 22MP Mamiya ZD in 2004, the first ever medium format DSLR. It also developed a ZD digital back but announced a partnership with back maker Phase One. Camera maker Sinar was taken over in stages by the digital camera back manufacturer and developer Jenoptik, and partnered with Rollei for the development of the Hy6 medium-format camera systems. DHW Fototechnik presented at photokina 2012 an updated version of the Hy6, called the Hy6 Mod2. The Leaf Aptus 75S digital back offers 33MP resolution, with a shooting speed of 50 frames a minute. In early 2006 Hasselblad (H2D and H3D) and Phase One (P45) released a 39 megapixel back. In 2008, Phase One announced the P65+, a 60 megapixel back, the highest resolution single-shot digital back at that time (2008). Phase One continues to dominate high end non-interpolated imaging with the largest market share. Sinar continues to provide its primary Digital View Camera system while still supporting the HY6 medium format with a new platform independent eSprit 65 LV digital camera back. On 20 September 2010, Leaf released a 80MP digital back, the Aptus-II 12. The Leaf Aptus-II 12's sensor size of 53.7 mm √ó 40.3 mm is 92% of the area of a 56 mm √ó 41.5 mm standard- sized 6 √ó 4.5 frame, 69% of a 56 mm √ó 56 mm square-sized 6 √ó 6 frame, and 45% of the area of a 56 mm √ó 84 mm 6 √ó 9 frame. Available since December 2010, Pentax 645D is 40 megapixel medium-format DSLR. The camera has 44√ó33 mm image sensor and the raw file is in DNG format. It is the first digital version of the company's 645 medium-format camera system and it is compatible with the existing 645 system lenses. In early 2014, for the first time Medium format uses CMOS sensor instead of CCD sensor for better image quality mainly in High ISO with a dynamic range of up to 14 f-stops. Phase One and Hasselblad use the same 50MP CMOS sensors made by Sony. Similarly, the Pentax 645Z uses a 51.4 MP CMOS sensor.  \\"Lomography\\" and other low-budget medium-format cameras  Baldafix folding camera, one of a large number of old folding cameras which used medium-format film, with a roll of 120 film While most professional medium-format cameras are very expensive, some inexpensive plastic imports, such as Diana and Holga, are gaining in popularity, particularly with toy camera enthusiasts. Many of these cameras are sold through the Austrian Lomographische AG. Due to the poor quality of the cameras, the exact image captured on the negative is somewhat random in nature. These cameras often have plastic lenses that offer poor or uneven focus, light leaks that oddly colorize an image, extreme vignetting, and a multitude of other attributes that are generally undesirable to photographers. While these elements certainly are flaws from the point of view of camera design, they can produce interesting, artistic, or enjoyable results. Because of the popularity of lomography and toy camera culture, medium-format photography has seen a resurgence with amateur photographers. Twin-lens reflex cameras (TLRs) and folders without the distortion and light leaks can be purchased on the used market in the same price range. The Chinese Seagull TLR and medium-format cameras from the former Soviet Union such as the Russian Lubitel and somewhat better made Ukrainian Kiev-Arsenal 60 and 88 are also available at moderate prices. These cameras can deliver quality images, although the lenses and camera bodies are not at the level of those from Swedish, German, and Japanese manufacturers. Depending on the condition of the camera, they can produce images ranging from Lomography to images close to the European and Japanese counterparts. Used folding cameras, TLRs, and box cameras are also a cheap option to shoot medium format. Many U.S.-made folders, including most of the mass-produced Kodak folders, use the discontinued 620 film requiring the user to respool 120 films or modify the film spool to fit.

The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be co- transcribed to define an operon. Originally, operons were thought to exist solely in prokaryotes (which includes organelles like plastids that are derived from bacteria), but since the discovery of the first operons in eukaryotes in the early 1990s, more evidence has arisen to suggest they are more common than previously assumed. In general, expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of polycistronic mRNAs, while eukaryotic operons lead to monocistronic mRNAs. Operons are also found in viruses such as bacteriophages. For example, T7 phages have two operons. The first operon codes for various products, including a special T7 RNA polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operon. The second operon includes a lysis gene meant to cause the host cell to burst.  History  The term \\"operon\\" was first proposed in a short paper in the Proceedings of the French Academy of Science in 1960. From this paper, the so-called general theory of the operon was developed. This theory suggested that in all cases, genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene. Later, it was discovered that genes could be positively regulated and also regulated at steps that follow transcription initiation. Therefore, it is not possible to talk of a general regulatory mechanism, because different operons have different mechanisms. Today, the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mRNA molecule. Nevertheless, the development of the concept is considered a landmark event in the history of molecular biology. The first operon to be described was the lac operon in E. coli. The 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine was awarded to Fran√ßois Jacob, Andr√© Michel Lwoff and Jacques Monod for their discoveries concerning the operon and virus synthesis.  Overview  Operons occur primarily in prokaryotes but also in some eukaryotes, including nematodes such as C. elegans and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. rRNA genes often exist in operons that have been found in a range of eukaryotes including chordates. An operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator. It is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes, plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes.5 The regulators of a given operon, including repressors, corepressors, and activators, are not necessarily coded for by that operon. The location and condition of the regulators, promoter, operator and structural DNA sequences can determine the effects of common mutations. Operons are related to regulons, stimulons and modulons; whereas operons contain a set of genes regulated by the same operator, regulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single regulatory protein, and stimulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single cell stimulus. According to its authors, the term \\"operon\\" is derived from the verb \\"to operate\\".  As a unit of transcription  An operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mRNA (a single mRNA molecule that codes for more than one protein). However, the definition of an operon does not require the mRNA to be polycistronic, though in practice, it usually is. Upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. Close to the promoter lies a section of DNA called an operator.  Operons versus clustering of prokaryotic genes  All the structural genes of an operon are turned ON or OFF together, due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them, but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed. To achieve this aspect, some bacterial genes are located near together, but there is a specific promoter for each of them; this is called gene clustering. Usually these genes encode proteins which will work together in the same pathway, such as a metabolic pathway. Gene clustering helps a prokaryotic cell to produce metabolic enzymes in a correct order.  General structure  thumb300pxLac Operon1: RNA Polymerase, 2: Repressor, 3: Promoter, 4: Operator, 5: Lactose, 6: lacZ, 7: lacY, 8: lacA. Top: The gene is essentially turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the repressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and making lactase. Bottom: The gene is turned on. Lactose is inhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter, and express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will digest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The repressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase. An operon is made up of 3 basic DNA components: * Promoter ‚Äì a nucleotide sequence that enables a gene to be transcribed. The promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase, which then initiates transcription. In RNA synthesis, promoters indicate which genes should be used for messenger RNA creation ‚Äì and, by extension, control which proteins the cell produces. * Operator ‚Äì a segment of DNA to which a repressor binds. It is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon. The main operator (O1) in the lac operon is located slightly downstream of the promoter; two additional operators, O1 and O3 are located at -82 and +412, respectively. In the case of a repressor, the repressor protein physically obstructs the RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes. * Structural genes ‚Äì the genes that are co-regulated by the operon. Not always included within the operon, but important in its function is a regulatory gene, a constantly expressed gene which codes for repressor proteins. The regulatory gene does not need to be in, adjacent to, or even near the operon to control it. An inducer (small molecule) can displace a repressor (protein) from the operator site (DNA), resulting in an uninhibited operon. Alternatively, a corepressor can bind to the repressor to allow its binding to the operator site. A good example of this type of regulation is seen for the trp operon.  Regulation  Control of an operon is a type of gene regulation that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions. Operon regulation can be either negative or positive by induction or repression. Negative control involves the binding of a repressor to the operator to prevent transcription. * In negative inducible operons, a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator, which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon. If an inducer molecule is present, it binds to the repressor and changes its conformation so that it is unable to bind to the operator. This allows for expression of the operon. The lac operon is a negatively controlled inducible operon, where the inducer molecule is allolactose. * In negative repressible operons, transcription of the operon normally takes place. Repressor proteins are produced by a regulator gene, but they are unable to bind to the operator in their normal conformation. However, certain molecules called corepressors are bound by the repressor protein, causing a conformational change to the active site. The activated repressor protein binds to the operator and prevents transcription. The trp operon, involved in the synthesis of tryptophan (which itself acts as the corepressor), is a negatively controlled repressible operon. Operons can also be positively controlled. With positive control, an activator protein stimulates transcription by binding to DNA (usually at a site other than the operator). * In positive inducible operons, activator proteins are normally unable to bind to the pertinent DNA. When an inducer is bound by the activator protein, it undergoes a change in conformation so that it can bind to the DNA and activate transcription. * In positive repressible operons, the activator proteins are normally bound to the pertinent DNA segment. However, when an inhibitor is bound by the activator, it is prevented from binding the DNA. This stops activation and transcription of the system.  The lac operon  The lac operon of the model bacterium Escherichia coli was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, a promoter, a terminator, and an operator. The lac operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and lactose. It can be activated by allolactose. Lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription. This is an example of the derepressible (from above: negative inducible) model.So it is a negative inducible operon induced by presence of lactose or allolactose.  The trp operon  Discovered in 1953 by Jacques Monod and colleagues, the trp operon in E. coli was the first repressible operon to be discovered. While the lac operon can be activated by a chemical (allolactose), the tryptophan (Trp) operon is inhibited by a chemical (tryptophan). This operon contains five structural genes: trp E, trp D, trp C, trp B, and trp A, which encodes tryptophan synthetase. It also contains a promoter which binds to RNA polymerase and an operator which blocks transcription when bound to the protein synthesized by the repressor gene (trp R) that binds to the operator. In the lac operon, lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription, while in the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription. Also unlike the lac operon, the trp operon contains a leader peptide and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation. This is an example of the corepressible model.  Predicting the number and organization of operons  The number and organization of operons has been studied most critically in E. coli. As a result, predictions can be made based on an organism's genomic sequence. One prediction method uses the intergenic distance between reading frames as a primary predictor of the number of operons in the genome. The separation merely changes the frame and guarantees that the read through is efficient. Longer stretches exist where operons start and stop, often up to 40‚Äì50 bases. An alternative method to predict operons is based on finding gene clusters where gene order and orientation is conserved in two or more genomes. Operon prediction is even more accurate if the functional class of the molecules is considered. Bacteria have clustered their reading frames into units, sequestered by co-involvement in protein complexes, common pathways, or shared substrates and transporters. Thus, accurate prediction would involve all of these data, a difficult task indeed. Pascale Cossart's laboratory was the first to experimentally identify all operons of a microorganism, Listeria monocytogenes. The 517 polycistronic operons are listed in a 2009 study describing the global changes in transcription that occur in L. monocytogenes under different conditions.

The company was founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land, to exploit the use of its Polaroid polarizing polymer. Land ran the company until 1981. Its peak employment was 21,000 in 1978, and its peak revenue was $3 billion in 1991. When the original Polaroid Corporation was declared bankrupt in 2001, its brand and assets were sold off. The \\"new\\" Polaroid formed as a result, itself declaring bankruptcy in 2008, resulting in a further sale. In May 2017, the brand and intellectual property of Polaroid Corporation were acquired by the largest shareholder of the Impossible Project, which had originally started out in 2008 by producing new instant films for Polaroid cameras.Zhang, Michael (2017). Polaroid Acquired by The Impossible Project‚Äôs Largest Shareholder, PetaPixel.com, 10 May 2017 The Impossible Project was renamed Polaroid Originals in September 2017,\\"The first Polaroid instant camera in a decade is adorable\\" Sean O'Kane, The Verge, 13 September 2017.

Polaroid 80B Highlander instant camera made in the USA, circa 1959 Polaroid 3000 Speed Type 47 Rollfilm Expired June 1962Polaroid Automatic 350 instant camera, made from 1969 to 1971, MSRP $150 Polaroid 430 Land Camera Polaroid SX-70 Land Camera model 2 instant camera, made in the USA circa 1972 to 1974 Polaroid Sun Autofocus 660 instant camera, circa 1987 Polaroid OneStep Autofocus SE instant camera, made in the United Kingdom circa 1997 The original Polaroid Corporation was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by Edwin Land and George W. Wheelwright III in 1937. Described by The Boston Globe as a \\"juggernaut of innovation\\", and \\"the Apple of its time\\" with a \\"leader in Edwin Land, a scientist who guided the company as the founding CEO for four decades\\". Polaroid‚Äôs initial market was in polarized sunglasses ‚Äî spawned from Land‚Äôs self-guided research in light polarization. Land, having completed his freshman year at Harvard University, left to pursue this market, resulting in Polaroid's birth. Land later returned to Harvard to continue his research. Polaroid, owning patents to its polarizer technology, got its start by employing polarization in products that included 3-D movies and glare-reducing goggles for dogs. During World War II, Polaroid designed and manufactured numerous products for the armed services including an infrared night viewing device. He led the company as CEO for 43 years. He headed the Polaroid Corporation, developing it from a small research and marketing firm into a well known high-tech company. Kodak was a customer for some of Land's polarizing products. Recognized by most as the father of instant photography, he included all the operations of a darkroom inside the film itself. Land was pictured on the cover of Life magazine in 1972 with the inscription, \\"A Genius and His Magic Camera\\". In the 1940s, Polaroid purchased the B B Chemical Company building at 784 Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts for its headquarters. The landmark Streamline Moderne style structure would be added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1982. When Kodak announced instant film cameras in 1976, Polaroid announced they were suing them, accusing Kodak of having stolen its patented instant photography process. In the two years that followed the lawsuit, total sales of instant cameras climbed from 7.4 million cameras in 1976 to 10.3 million in 1977 and 14.3 million in 1978. The suit in federal court lasted 10 years. Polaroid asked for $12 billion for infringements of its patents by Kodak. The court ruled in favor of Polaroid, and ordered Kodak to cease instant picture production, plus pay Polaroid $909.5 million of the $12 billion it had asked for. =Decline= In 1977, Land introduced the Polaroid Instant Home Movie camera named Polavision, based on the Dufaycolor process. However, the product arrived on the market when videotape-based systems were rapidly gaining popularity. Thus it failed to sell well in retail stores and has been described as the swan song for Polaroid. After four decades as chairman, Edwin Land was coerced into resigning and leaving the corporation he had founded. He died in 1991. The Polavision debacle eventually caused the company to write off $89 million, including most of the manufactured products. The underlying technology of Polavision was later improved for use in the Polachrome instant slide film system. In the 1980s, Polaroid tried to reinvent itself without Land at its helm by shifting away from a dependence on consumer photography, a market which was in steady decline. In 1984 Polaroid announced \\"that it would enter the United States electronic video market with its own line of Polaroid videotapes.\\" Polaroid was forced to make wholesale changes that included having to fire thousands of workers and close many factories. The 1990s saw the advent of new technologies that profoundly changed the world of photography ‚Äî one-hour color film processing, single-use cameras from competitors, videotape camcorders, and digital cameras. The company also was one of the early manufacturers of digital cameras, with the PDC-2000 in 1996; however, they failed to capture a large market share in that segment. They also made 35 mm and multi format scanners, such as Polaroid SprintScan 4000 35 mm scanner (the first scanner with a 4000 DPI CCD) in 1999, and the Polaroid PrintScan 120 in 2000. The scanners received mixed reviews and saw heavy competition from Nikon and Minolta products. The entire line was discontinued when Polaroid entered bankruptcy in 2001. Prior to bankruptcy, the company sold its landmark, historic headquarters building and surrounding property to The Bulfinch Companies for $10 million. = Bankruptcy and the \\"new\\" Polaroid Corporation =  \\"Chapter 11\\" controversy  The original Polaroid Corporation filed for federal bankruptcy protection on October 11, 2001. The outcome was that within ten months, most of the business (including the \\"Polaroid\\" name itself and non-bankrupt foreign subsidiaries) had been sold to Bank One's One Equity Partners (OEP). OEP Imaging Corporation then changed its name to Polaroid Holding Company (PHC).Frieswick, Kris, \\"What's wrong with this picture?\\" , cfo.com. Article dated 2003-01-01, retrieved 2006-11-30. (p1: Sale of business/assets, controversy. p4: Renamed as Primary PDC, distribution to unsecured creditors). However, this new company operated using the name of its bankrupt predecessor, Polaroid Corporation.\\"Polaroid and One Equity Partners Complete Asset Acquisition\\" , New Polaroid Corporation. Press release dated 2002-07-31, Retrieved 2006-12-01. Significant criticism surrounded this \\"takeover\\" because the process left executives of the company with large bonuses, while stockholders, as well as current and retired employees, were left with nothing. The company announced a plan that gave the top 45 executives bonuses just for staying at their jobs. Meanwhile, other employees were restricted from selling their stock before leaving their jobs. As part of the settlement, the original Polaroid Corporation changed its name to Primary PDC, Inc. Having sold its assets, it was now effectively nothing more than an administrative shell. Primary PDC received approximately 35 percent of the \\"new\\" Polaroid, which was to be distributed to its unsecured creditors (including bondholders).O'Neill, Jerry \\"The New Polaroid: After Chapter 11\\" , \\"From the October 2002 Issue of Imaging Business\\" via imaginginfo.com. Article updated 2006-02-08, retrieved 2006-12-01. , Primary PDC remained in existence under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but conducts no commercial business and has no employees. Polaroid‚Äôs bankruptcy is widely attributed to the failure of senior management ‚Äî unable to anticipate the impact of digital cameras on its film business. This type of managerial failure is also known as the success trap.  Use of Polaroid brand following bankruptcy  After the bankruptcy, the Polaroid brand was licensed for use on other products with the assistance of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. In September 2002, World Wide Licenses, a subsidiary of The Character Group plc, was granted the exclusive rights for three years to manufacture and sell digital cameras under the Polaroid brand for distribution internationally.Press release for camera licensing agreement (PDF) , World Wide Licenses Ltd. Article dated 2002-09-24, retrieved 2006-12-01. Polaroid branded LCDs and plasma televisions and portable DVD players had also appeared on the market. On April 27, 2005, Petters Group Worldwide announced its acquisition of PHC. Petters has in the past bought up failed companies with well-known names for the value of those names. The same year, Flextronics purchased Polaroid's manufacturing operations and the decision was made to send most of the manufacturing to China. It stopped making Polaroid cameras in 2007 and discontinued the sale of Polaroid film after 2009 to the dismay of loyal consumers. On December 18, 2008, the post-reorganization Polaroid Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota. The bankruptcy filing came shortly after the criminal investigation of its parent company, Petters Group Worldwide, and the parent company founder, Tom Petters.  Auction for Polaroid Corporation's assets  On April 2, 2009, Patriarch Partners won an auction for Polaroid Corporation's assets including the company's name, intellectual property, and photography collection. Patriarch's $59.1 million bid beat bids from PHC Acquisitions, Hilco Consumer Capital Corp and Ritchie Capital.https://www.reuters.com/article/polaroid- auction/update-2-patriarch-wins-polaroid-auction-idUSN0227748920090403 This led to some very contentious fighting and litigation, and Patriarch wound up walking away in early May 2009, and a joint venture between Gordon Brothers Brands LLC and Hilco Consumer Capital LP picked up the pieces. Quoting from a Reuters report which quoted some participants: > The move by New York-based Patriarch, a private-equity firm, [to drop their > claim], follows US District Judge James Rosenbaum's ruling on Thursday in > Minneapolis that putting the purchase on hold during appeal would threaten > operations at Polaroid, which is spending its cash at a rate of $3 million a > month. On April 16, 2009, Polaroid won US Bankruptcy Court approval to be sold to a joint venture of Hilco Consumer Capital LP of Toronto and Gordon Brothers Brands LLC of Boston.\\"Polaroid sale can proceed, judge rules\\", The Boston Globe. Retrieved on 7 May 2009. . Hilco Consumer Capital and Gordon Brothers Brands announced the closing of the purchase of Polaroid Corporation on May 7, 2009, placing Polaroid Corporation in joint holding under a parent company named PLR IP Holdings, LLC. Former Executive Vice President and General Manager ‚Äì Americas, Scott W. Hardy was named as the new President of Polaroid Corporation and PLR IP Holdings, LLC. The majority of employees remained in their positions at the company's Minnetonka, Minnesota headquarters as well as office locations in Boston, New York and Toronto. On June 19, 2009, the new holding corporation for Polaroid, PLR IP Holdings, LLC announced an exclusive 5-year agreement with Summit Global Group to produce and distribute Polaroid- branded digital still cameras, digital video cameras, digital photo frames and PoGo-branded mobile products. Summit Global Group added several former Polaroid employees to their staff. The company expects the agreement to yield $1.3 billion in retail sales over an unspecified period beginning in 2009. = Licensor = On January 5, 2010, Polaroid appointed Lady Gaga as \\"Creative Director\\" for the company. A press release stated that she would be the \\"new face\\" of Polaroid. = Acquisition by Smo≈Çokowski; collaboration with and rebranding of \\"Impossible\\" = In 2017, the holding corporation for Polaroid, PLR IP Holdings, LLC, was acquired by Polish investor Wiacezlaw \\"Slava\\" Smo≈Çokowski. Smo≈Çokowski was already the largest shareholder in the Impossible Project‚Äîa company formed to continue production of Polaroid-compatible film after Polaroid themselves left the market‚Äîhaving been persuaded to invest in it by his son Oskar. The acquisition brought both companies under the control of the Smo≈Çokowski family. The Impossible Project (already led by Oskar Smo≈Çokowski) was rebranded as Polaroid Originals, with the last factory producing Polaroid-compatible instant film cartridges in Enschede, Netherlands being rebranded under the new name later in 2017. In March 2019, the new polaroid.com website listed instant cameras and supplies made by Polaroid Originals alongside its other products including digital cameras, sunglasses, the Cube action camera, and television units. March 2020, Polaroid Originals rebranded as Polaroid, with the Polaroid Now being the first instant film camera in years to have the Polaroid branding.  Other ventures  = (diskettes)= Polaroid had its own brand of diskettes (floppy disks), and also a data recovery service. The New York Times described it as a major brand.(alphabetically) Three years after listing Polaroid alphabetically among six major brands, it was listed a notch lower in an almost reverse alphabetical list by The Times, Verbatim dropped, BASF added: which noted \\"remember that those companies established their reputations by selling other products, not diskettes.\\" By mid 1991, they stopped selling floppy disks. The packaging used both the Polaroid and a branding, PerfectData =Corporate sponsorship of motorsports= In the 1990s, Polaroid was involved in corporate sponsorship of NASCAR. For several years, Polaroid was the principal sponsor of NASCAR's 125 mile Featherlite Modified race at Watkins Glen and it was called the \\"Polaroid 125\\". The Polaroid name was also used in sponsorship in the NASCAR Busch Series. In 1992, Polaroid was the principal sponsor of female NASCAR driver Shawna Robinson's #25 Oldsmobile in the Busch Series. They continued as her principal sponsor when she moved to the other car numbers in 1993 and 1994. Polaroid formerly sponsored the Target Chip Ganassi entry of Juan Pablo Montoya's #42 Chevy Impala in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and entries in the IRL Indy Car Series, including the car driven by Dario Franchitti. The Polaroid name has also been associated with the NOPI drift series. Polaroid was the principal sponsor of the Nissan 350Z driven by Nick Bollea in the 2007 season. = Discontinuation and planned relaunch of Polaroid film = On February 8, 2008, Polaroid (under the control of Thomas J. Petters of Petters Group Worldwide) announced that the company has decided to gradually cease production and withdraw from analog instant film products completely in 2008. Since March 2010, instant film materials for vintage Polaroid cameras have again become available on the market, developed and manufactured by a group called The Impossible Project, at the former Polaroid production plant in Enschede, Netherlands. Austrian photographer Florian Kaps, the owner of the largest online vendor for SX-70 films and organizer of the web-based instant photo gallery Polanoid.net, had bought the approximately 500,000 film packages that were on stock. He teamed with Andr√© Bosman, a former head of film production in the large Polaroid film factory at Enschede, designed a plan to redesign the SX-70/600 film system in collaboration with Ilford Photo, and convinced the Polaroid owners to participate. Plans for a relaunch under the Impossible label were announced in January 2009. Buildings in the Enschede plant, which had produced 30 million film packs in 2007 and 24 million in the first half of 2008, were leased to the company created by Kaps, who by May 2009 had raised $2.6 million from friends and family for what he had named The Impossible Project. On March 22, 2010, Impossible announced the release of two monochromatic films, PX100 and PX600, compatible with SX-70 and 600 type cameras, respectively. Color films were initially released in 2010 for SX-70 type cameras, followed in 2011 with the release of much improved color films for Polaroid 600, SX-70 and Spectra Cameras. Then Impossible had originally announced a new camera that was going to be styled after older Polaroid models to coincide with the new film. So, the camera was due to come out before Christmas 2010, but the deadline was not met with no new information on the camera. Then sometime after that, Impossible released a camera that did not look like any of the older Polaroid models. The camera was called the Impossible I-1 and it was the first camera to use I-type Film and was backwards compatible with 600 Film due to I-type film being 600 film without a battery. Then sometime after the rebranding to Polaroid Originals in September 2017, Polaroid Originals came out with another camera. The camera was called the OneStep 2, which was modeled after the original OneStep with new features as originally planned. But the OneStep 2 used the same type of film as the Impossible I-1 unlike the OneStep that used SX-70 Film. On April 28, 2012, the documentary \\"Time Zero: The Last Year of Polaroid Film\\", directed by Grant Hamilton, was released in the U.S. It covers the rise, fall, and grass-roots revival of Polaroid's instant film technology. = Mobile printers = In summer 2008 Polaroid released the PoGo, an instant photo printer producing prints. It uses the Zink (\\"zero ink\\") technology which is similar to dye sublimation but has the dye crystals embedded in the photo paper itself. Models CZA-10011B and CZA-20011B exist (which Polaroid claim to be identical). In 2009, the CZA-05300B PoGo, a 5 megapixel digital camera integrated with a Zink printer, was released. In 2011, the company released the Polaroid GL10 Instant Mobile Printer producing 3 by 4 inch prints.Staff, Voxy. \\"Lady Gaga Launches Mobile Printer .\\" September 14, 2011. Retrieved September 15, 2011. The printer, designed by Polaroid and Lady Gaga, allows people to print directly from a mobile phone or digital camera. This product is the first product in the new Polaroid Grey Label line. = Digital photography = Polaroid released a line of cameras without printers including the t1035, a 10-megapixel digital camera.Polaroid t1035 digital camera In January 2012, Polaroid announced a new \\"smart camera\\", entitled the Polaroid SC1630 smart camera, which is powered by Google Android. The SC1630 is a combination of a camera and a portable media player, that allows users to take photos with a built-in 16 MP HD camera, download apps from Google Play, check their email, and browse the web. The built-in camera allows 3X optical zoom. Other features on the media player include wi-fi, touch screen, geotagging, smart albums, and 32 GB of storage via a micro SD card. In September 2014 Polaroid introduced a $99 action camera named the \\"Polaroid Cube\\", marketed as an alternative to cameras such as the GoPro Hero (which retails for $129), specifically for casual, light users of action camcorders. In 2015 GoPro released the similar GoPro HERO4 Session. = Wideblue = In March 2006, the specialist design and development department in Polaroid's Vale of Leven plant in Scotland was bought out by its management team.

Introduced in 1900,List of Brownie models at George Eastman House it introduced the snapshot to the masses. It was a basic cardboard box camera with a simple meniscus lens that took 2 1/4-inch square pictures on 117 roll film. It was conceived and marketed for sales of Kodak roll films. Because of its simple controls and initial price of $1 () along with the low price of Kodak roll film and processing, the Brownie camera surpassed its marketing goalLothrop, Eaton S. ‚ÄúThe Brownie Camera.‚Äù History of Photography 2, no. 1 (January 1978): 1‚Äì10. https://doi.org/10.1080/03087298.1978.10442948. It was invented by Frank A. Brownell. The name comes from the brownies (spirits in folklore) in Palmer Cox cartoons. Over 150,000 Brownie cameras were shipped in the first year of production. An improved model, called No. 2 Brownie came in 1901, which produced larger 2-1/4 by 3-1/4 inch photos and cost $2 and was also a huge success. Brownies were extensively marketed to children, with Kodak using them to popularise photography. They were also taken to war by soldiers. As they were ubiquitous, many iconic shots were taken on Brownies. The cameras continued to be popular, and spawned many varieties, such as a Boy Scout edition in the 1930s. In 1940, Kodak released the Six-20 Flash Brownie, Kodak's first internally synchronized flash camera, using General Electric bulbs. In 1957, Kodak produced the Brownie Starflash, Kodak's first camera with a built-in flash. The Brownie 127 was popular,\\"Brownie 127\\" selling in the millions between 1952 and 1967. It was a bakelite camera with a simple meniscus lens and a curved film plane to compensate for the deficiencies of the lens. Another model was the Brownie Cresta sold between 1955 and 1958. It used 120 film and had a fixed-focus lens. Having written an article in the 1940s for amateur photographers suggesting an expensive camera was unnecessary for quality photography, Picture Post photographer Bert Hardy used a Brownie camera to stage a carefully posed snapshot of two young women sitting on railings above a breezy Blackpool promenade.Bert Hardy snapshot The last official Brownie camera made was the Brownie II Camera, a 110 cartridge film model produced in Brazil for one year, 1986. The Kodak Brownie Number 2 is a box camera that was manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company from 1901 to 1935. There were five models, A through F, and it was the first camera to use 120 film. It also came with a viewfinder and a handle. The Brownie Number 2 was made of a choice of three materials: cardboard, costing US$2.00, aluminum, costing US$2.75, and a color model which cost US$2.50. It was a very popular and affordable camera, and many are still in use by film photographers.

Audio feedback (also known as acoustic feedback, simply as feedback, or the Larsen effect) is a special kind of positive loop gain which occurs when a sound loop exists between an audio input (for example, a microphone or guitar pickup) and an audio output (for example, a power amplified loudspeaker). In this example, a signal received by the microphone is amplified and passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again. The frequency of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker, and the distance between them. For small PA systems the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech. The principles of audio feedback were first discovered by Danish scientist S√∏ren Absalon Larsen, hence the name \\"Larsen Effect\\". Feedback is almost always considered undesirable when it occurs with a singer's or public speaker's microphone at an event using a sound reinforcement system or PA system. Audio engineers typically use directional microphones with cardioid pickup patterns and various electronic devices, such as equalizers and, since the 1990s, automatic feedback detection devices, to prevent these unwanted squeals or screeching sounds, which detract from the audience's enjoyment of the event and may damage equipment. On the other hand, since the 1960s, electric guitar players in rock music bands using loud guitar amplifiers, speaker cabinets and distortion effects have intentionally created guitar feedback to create different sounds including long sustained tones that cannot be produced using standard playing techniques. The sound of guitar feedback is considered to be a desirable musical effect in heavy metal music, hardcore punk and grunge. Jimi Hendrix was an innovator in the intentional use of guitar feedback, alongside effects units such as the Univibe and wah-wah pedal in his guitar solos to create unique sound effects and musical sounds. History and theory The conditions for feedback follow the Barkhausen stability criterion, namely that, with sufficiently high gain, a stable oscillation can (and usually will) occur in a feedback loop whose frequency is such that the phase delay is an integer multiple of 360 degrees and the gain at that frequency is equal to 1. If the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified. Sound will be produced without anyone actually playing. The sound level will increase until the output starts clipping, reducing the loop gain to exactly unity. This is the principle upon which electronic oscillators are based; although in that case the feedback loop is purely electronic, the principle is the same. If the gain is large, but slightly less than 1, then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created, but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system, such as through a microphone. Early academic work on acoustical feedback was done by Dr. C. Paul Boner. Boner reasoned that when feedback happened, it did so at one precise frequency. He also reasoned that it could be stopped by inserting a very narrow notch filter at that frequency in the loudspeaker's signal chain.Behavior of Sound System Response Immediately Below Feedback, CP Boner, J. Audio Eng. Soc, 1966 He worked with Gifford White, founder of White Instruments to hand craft notch filters for specific feedback frequencies in specific rooms. Boner was responsible for establishing basic theories of acoustic feedback, room-ring modes, and room- sound system equalizing techniques. =Distance= To maximize gain before feedback, the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical. As sound pressure falls off with 1/r with respect to the distance r in free space, or up to a distance known as reverberation distance in closed spaces (and the energy density with 1/r¬≤), it is important to keep the microphones at a large enough distance from the speaker systems. As well, microphones should not be positioned in front of speakers and individuals using mics should be asked to avoid pointing the microphone at speaker enclosures. =Directivity= Additionally, the loudspeakers and microphones should have non-uniform directivity and should stay out of the maximum sensitivity of each other, ideally at a direction of cancellation. Public address speakers often achieve directivity in the mid and treble region (and good efficiency) via horn systems. Sometimes the woofers have a cardioid characteristic. Professional setups circumvent feedback by placing the main speakers a far distance from the band or artist, and then having several smaller speakers known as monitors pointing back at each band member, but in the opposite direction to that in which the microphones are pointing. This allows independent control of the sound pressure levels for the audience and the performers. If monitors are oriented at 180 degrees to the microphones that are their sources, the microphones should have a cardioid pickup pattern. Super- or hypercardioid patterns are suitable if the monitor speakers are located at a different angle on the back side of the microphones, they also better cancel reverberations coming from elsewhere. Almost all microphones for sound reinforcement are directional. =Frequency response= Almost always, the natural frequency responses of sound reinforcement systems is not ideally flat. This leads to acoustical feedback at the frequency with the highest loop gain, which may be much higher than the average gain over all frequencies (resonance). It is therefore helpful to apply some form of equalization to reduce the gain of this frequency. Feedback can be reduced manually by \\"ringing out\\" a sound system prior to a performance. The sound engineer can increase the level of a microphone or guitar pickup until feedback occurs. The engineer can then attenuate the relevant frequency on an equalizer preventing feedback at that frequency but allowing sufficient volume at other frequencies. Many professional sound engineers can identify feedback frequencies by ear but others use a real time analyzer to identify the ringing frequency. To avoid feedback, automatic anti-feedback devices can be used. (In the marketplace these go by the name \\"feedback destroyer\\" or \\"feedback eliminator\\".) Some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly, with this upshift resulting in a \\"chirp\\"-sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback. Other devices use sharp notch-filters to filter out offending frequencies. Adaptive algorithms are often used to automatically tune these notch filters. Deliberate uses Electric guitarist Jimi Hendrix, pictured here in a 1967 concert, was an innovator in the use of guitar feedback effects. To intentionally create feedback, an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet, with very high gain (amplification) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker. The guitarist then allows the open strings to vibrate freely and brings the guitar close to the speaker enclosure of the guitar amp. The use of distortion effects units also facilitates the creation of intentional feedback. =Early examples in popular music= A deliberate use of acoustic feedback was pioneered by Blues and Rock 'n' Roll guitarists such as Willie Johnson, Johnny Watson and Link Wray. According to AllMusic's Richie Unterberger, the very first use of feedback on a commercial rock record is the introduction of the song \\"I Feel Fine\\" by the Beatles, recorded in 1964.Unterberger, Richie. \\"'I Feel Fine' song review\\", AllMusic.com. Jay Hodgson agrees that it was the first chart-topper to showcase feedback distortion, created by John Lennon leaning a semi-acoustic guitar against an amplifier.Hodgson (2010), p.120-121. The Who's 1965 hits \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" and \\"My Generation\\" featured feedback manipulation by Pete Townshend, with an extended solo in the former and the shaking of his guitar in front of the amplifier to create a throbbing noise in the latter. Canned Heat's \\"Fried Hockey Boogie\\" (off of their 1968 album Boogie with Canned Heat) also featured guitar feedback produced by Henry Vestine during his solo to create a highly amplified distorted boogie style of feedback. In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feed back.Hey, what's that sound: Homemade guitars The Guardian. Retrieved August 17, 2011Brian May Interview The Music Biz (1992). Retrieved August 17, 2011 Feedback was used extensively after 1965 by the Monks,Shaw, Thomas Edward and Anita Klemke. Black Monk Time: a book about the monks. Reno: Carson Street Publishing, 1995. Jefferson Airplane, the Velvet Underground and the Grateful Dead, who included in many of their live shows a segment named Feedback, a several-minutes long feedback- driven improvisation. Feedback has since become a striking characteristic of rock music, as electric guitar players such as Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, Dave Davies, Steve Marriott and Jimi Hendrix deliberately induced feedback by holding their guitars close to the amplifier's speaker. Jazz guitarist G√°bor Szab√≥ was one of the earliest jazz musicians to use controlled feedback in his music, which is prominent on his live album The Sorcerer (1967). Szab√≥'s method included the use of a flat top acoustic guitar with a magnetic pickup. Lou Reed created his album Metal Machine Music (1975) entirely from loops of feedback played at various speeds. An example of feedback can be heard on Hendrix's performance of \\"Can You See Me?\\" at the Monterey Pop Festival. The entire guitar solo was created using amplifier feedback. =Introductions, transitions, and fade-outs= In addition to \\"I Feel Fine\\", feedback was used on the introduction to songs including Jimi Hendrix's \\"Foxy Lady\\", the Beatles' \\"It's All Too Much\\", Hendrix's \\"Crosstown Traffic\\", David Bowie's \\"Little Wonder\\", the Strokes's \\"New York City Cops\\", Ben Folds Five's \\"Fair\\", Midnight Juggernauts's \\"Road to Recovery\\", Nirvana's \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\", the Jesus and Mary Chain's \\"Tumbledown\\" and \\"Catchfire\\", the Stone Roses's \\"Waterfall\\", Porno for Pyros's \\"Tahitian Moon\\", Tool's \\"Stinkfist\\", and the Cure's \\"Prayer For Rain\\".Hodgson (2010), p.121-122. Examples of feedback combined with a quick volume swell used as a transition include Weezer's \\"My Name Is Jonas\\" and \\"Say It Ain't So\\"; The Strokes' \\"Reptilia\\", \\"New York City Cops\\", and \\"Juicebox\\"; Dream Theater's \\"As I Am\\"; as well as numerous tracks by Meshuggah and Tool.Hodgson (2010), p.122-123. Cacophonous feedback fade-outs ending a song are most often used to generate rather than relieve tension, often cross-faded too after a thematic and musical release. Examples include Modwheelmood's remix of Nine Inch Nail's \\"The Great Destroyer\\"; and the Jesus and Mary Chain's \\"Teenage Lust\\", \\"Tumbledown\\", \\"Catchfire\\", \\"Sundown\\", and \\"Frequency\\".Hodgson (2010), p.123. =Examples in modern classical music= Though closed circuit feedback was a prominent feature in many early experimental electronic music compositions, it was contemporary American composer Robert Ashley who first used acoustic feedback as sound material in his work The Wolfman (1964). Steve Reich makes extensive use of audio feedback in his work Pendulum Music (1968) by swinging a series of microphones back and forth in front of their corresponding amplifiers., 88 Hugh Davies van Eck (2017), p. 84 and Alvin Lucier van Eck (2017), p. 91 both use feedback in their works. More recent examples can be found in the work of for example Lara Stanic,van Eck (2017), p. 163 Paul Craenen,van Eck (2017), p. 159 Anne Wellmer,van Eck (2017), p. 93 Adam Basanta, Lesley Flanigan, Ronald Boersen and Erfan Abdi. =Pitched feedback= Pitched melodies may be created entirely from feedback through changing the angle between a guitar and amplifier after establishing a feedback loop. Examples include Tool's \\"Jambi\\", Robert Fripp's guitar on David Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" (album version), and Jimi Hendrix's \\"Third Stone from the Sun\\" and his live performance of \\"Wild Thing\\" at the Monterey Pop Festival.Hodgson (2010), p.119. Regarding Fripp's work on \\"Heroes\\": =Contemporary uses= Audio feedback became a signature feature of many underground rock bands during the 1980s. American noise-rockers Sonic Youth melded the rock-feedback tradition with a compositional/classical approach (notably covering Reich's \\"Pendulum Music\\"), and guitarist/producer Steve Albini's group Big Black also worked controlled feedback into the makeup of their songs. With the alternative rock movement of the 1990s, feedback again saw a surge in popular usage by suddenly mainstream acts like Nirvana, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine and the Smashing Pumpkins. =Devices= The Boss DF-2 Super Feedbacker and Distortion pedal (on the left) helps electric guitarists to create feedback effects. The principle of feedback is used in many guitar sustain devices. Examples include handheld devices like the EBow, built-in guitar pickups that increase the instrument's sonic sustain, string drivers mounted on a stand such as the Guitar Resonator, and sonic transducers mounted on the head of a guitar. Intended closed-circuit feedback can also be created by an effects unit, such as a delay pedal or effect fed back into a mixing console. The feedback can be controlled by using the fader to determine a volume level. The Boss DF-2 Super Feedbacker and Distortion pedal is an electronic effect unit that helps electric guitarists to create feedback effects.

Trevor and Christine Stanbury made the decision to diversify, and opened the farm to the public three months later on the 1st of July. Over the years the family have transformed the farm into an all weather adventure park with the addition of various attractions, rides and shows. In 2007, Trevor Stanbury was awarded a MBE for his services to tourism in southwest England. In 2009, he said he was keen to promote businesses in the area as he felt the most qualified of workers in Devon tended to move away. In 2016, the park was listed by Tripadvisor as one of the ten best amusement parks in Britain. Attractions The park organises events all year round in order to attract clientele outside the peak season in the summer. These include an annual Santa's Grotto. In 2015, the theme park started offering weddings in the ground, complete with rides on dodgems. The Lynbarn Railway is a narrow gauge railway inside the park's grounds.

Set in Shanghai in 1924, the film is about a covert cell of insurrectionist anarchists who attempt to overthrow the Japanese government's occupation of Korea through propaganda of the deed. Told from the perspective of the youngest member, Sang-gu, years after the fact, the story is a sympathetic look at a group of revolutionaries through the eyes of one of their own. Plot In the opening scene the protagonist begins to reminisce about his youth and remembers the day he was saved from execution in a raid performed by the anarchist cell he would later join. After reaching a safe house the group begins to teach him the tricks of their trade. He later takes part in several missions, though he continues to have difficulty throughout the film with the violence of his new job. Eventually a string of tragic events strike the team. One of their members is fatally betrayed during a mission, leading to their covers being blown during the next. Now wanted by the Japanese and Chinese authorities, their funders turn away from them and instead choose to support socialist electoral politics to further their cause. This angers the group, and they leave the larger organization, attempting to survive on their own by earning money through gambling and bank robbery. Over time the group becomes agitated with simply scraping by and several voice a desire to return to their old ways of clandestine warfare. They collectively decide to strike at the Japanese government in a high-profile attack, leading up to a dramatic finale.

These breeds are hunting dogs and are generally regarded as having some of the most sensitive noses among dogs. Hounds are hunting dogs that either hunt by following the scent of a game animal (scenthounds) or by following the animal by sight (sighthounds). There are many breeds in the scenthound type, and scenthounds may do other work as well, so exactly which breeds should be called scenthound can be controversial. Kennel clubs assign breeds of dogs to Groups, which are loosely based on breed types. Each kennel club determines which breeds it will place in a given group. Scent hounds specialize in following a smell or scent. Most of these breeds have long, drooping ears. One theory says that this trait helps to collect scent from the air and keep it near the dog's face and nose. They also have large nasal cavities, which helps them smell better. Their typically loose, moist lips are said to assist in trapping scent particles. Most of these breeds have deep, booming voices and use them actively when running, and especially when following a scent trail. Although this can be a nuisance in settled areas, it is a valuable trait that allows the dog's handler to follow the dog or pack of dogs during a hunt even when they are out of sight, such as when following a fox or raccoon through woodland. Scent hounds do not need to be as fast as sight hounds, because they do not need to keep prey in sight, but they need endurance so that they can stick with a scent and follow it for long distances over rough terrain. The best scent hounds can follow a scent trail even across running water and even when it is several days old. Most scent hounds are used for hunting in packs of multiple dogs. Longer-legged hounds run more quickly and usually require that the hunters follow on horseback; shorter-legged hounds allow hunters to follow on foot. Hunting with some breeds, such as German Bracke, American Foxhounds, or coonhounds, involves allowing the pack of dogs to run freely while the hunters wait in a fixed spot until the dogs' baying announces that the game has been \\"treed\\". The hunters then go to the spot on foot, following the sound of the dogs' baying.Coon hunting on ESPN The F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) places scent hounds into their classification \\"Group 6\\". This includes a subdivision, \\"Section 2, Leash Hounds\\", some examples of which are the Bavarian Mountain Scenthound (Bayrischer Gebirgsschweisshund, no. 217), the Hanoverian Scenthound (Hannover'scher Schweisshund, no. 213), and the Alpine Dachsbracke (Alpenl√§ndische Dachsbracke, no. 254). In addition, the Dalmatian and the Rhodesian Ridgeback are placed in Group 6 as \\"Related breeds\\". The United Kennel Club divides its Scenthound Group into two categories. The first, Tree Hounds, includes the American hunting dogs known as coonhounds and the European hounds from which they were developed. The second category is named Trailing Scenthounds, and includes dogs used for the tracking of game animals, and of humans (as in search-and-rescue, and fugitive capture). They are also used for explosives detection. The Trailing group are reputedly descended from a type of bloodhound kept by monks in Belgium.United Kennel Club (US) breed information  History  It is believed that scent hounds were bred from mastiff-type dogs by the Celts, long before the Christian era. They realized that some of the mastiff dogs had superior scenting ability and used them for hunting. The Celts selectively bred mastiffs that were best at following a trail, and may have later cross-bred them with sighthounds. Over the years, scent hounds became less bulky, with a lighter bone structure and an obliging temperament, but maintained the pendulous ears and thick, heavy skin. Their new traits allowed them to move faster, not get tired easily, and be more controllable during the hunt.https://www.akc.org/sports/field-events- hounds/coonhound/scenthound-history/  Genetic history  Genetic studies indicate that the scent hounds are more closely related to each other than they are with other branches on the dog family tree.

In southwest Asia, Neolithic cultures appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the Levant (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) and from there into the east and west. Early Neolithic structures and buildings can be found in southeast Anatolia, Syria, and Iraq by 8,000 BC with agriculture societies first appearing in southeast Europe by 6,500 BC, and central Europe by ca. 5,500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the Starƒçevo-Koros (Cris), Linearbandkeramic, and Vinƒça. Housing Kelheim (Lower Bavaria), Germany. Archaeological Museum: Reconstruction of a settlement of the Linear Pottery culture, 5th millennium BC. The Neolithic people in the Levant, Anatolia, Syria, northern Mesopotamia and central Asia were great builders, utilising mud-brick to construct houses and villages. At √áatalh√∂y√ºk, houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. In Europe, the Neolithic long house with a timber frame, pitched, thatched roof, and walls finished in wattle and daub could be very large, presumably housing a whole extended family. Villages might comprise only a few such houses. Neolithic pile dwellings have been excavated in Sweden (Alvastra pile dwelling) and in the circum-Alpine area, with remains being found at the Mondsee and Attersee lakes in Upper Austria. Early archaeologists like Ferdinand Keller thought they formed artificial islands, much like the Scottish crannogs, but today it is clear that the majority of settlements was located on the shores of lakes and were only inundated later on. Reconstructed pile dwellings are shown in open-air museums in Unteruhldingen and Z√ºrich (Pfahlbauland). In Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, Neolithic settlements included wattle-and-daub structures with thatched roofs and floors made of logs covered in clay.Gheorghiu, D. (2010).

This is also when the burdei pit-house (below-ground) style of house construction was developed, which was still used by Romanians and Ukrainians until the 20th century. Neolithic settlements and \\"cities\\" include: * G√∂bekli Tepe in Turkey, ca. 9,000 BC * Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the Levant, Neolithic from around 8,350 BC, arising from the earlier Epipaleolithic Natufian culture * Nevali Cori in Turkey, ca. 8,000 BC * √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey, 7,500 BC * Mehrgarh in Pakistan, 7,000 BC * Knap of Howar and Skara Brae, the Orkney Islands, Scotland, from 3,500 BC * over 3,000 settlements of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, some with populations up to 15,000 residents, flourished in present- day Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5,400‚Äì2,800 BC. Tombs and ritual monuments Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousand still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built long barrows and chamber tombs for their dead and causewayed camps, henges and cursus monuments. =Megalithic architecture= A dolmen at Couto Esteves, Portugal Megalithic tomb, Mane Braz, Brittany Megaliths found in Europe and the Mediterranean were also erected in the Neolithic period. These monuments include both megalithic tombs, temples and several structures of unknown function. Tomb architecture is normally easily distinguished by the presence of human remains that had originally been buried, often with recognizable intent. Other structures may have had a mixed use, now often characterised as religious, ritual, astronomical or political. The modern distinction between various architectural functions with which we are familiar today, now makes it difficult for us to think of some megalithic structures as multi-purpose socio-cultural centre points. Such structures would have served a mixture of socio-economic, ideological, political functions and indeed aesthetic ideals. The megalithic structures of ƒ†gantija, Tarxien, ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim, Mnajdra, Ta' ƒ¶aƒ°rat, Skorba and smaller satellite buildings on Malta and Gozo, first appearing in their current form around 3600 BC, represent one of the earliest examples of a fully developed architectural statement in which aesthetics, location, design and engineering fused into free-standing monuments. Stonehenge, the other well-known building from the Neolithic would later, 2600 and 2400 BC for the sarsen stones, and perhaps 3000 BC for the blue stones, be transformed into the form that we know so well. At its height Neolithic architecture marked geographic space; their durable monumentality embodied a past, perhaps made up of memories and remembrance. In the Central Mediterranean, Malta also became home of a subterranean skeuomorphised form of architecture around 3600 BC. At the ƒ¶al-Saflieni Hypogeum, the inhabitants of Malta carved out an underground burial complex in which surface architectural elements were used to embellish a series of chambers and entrances. It is at the Neolithic ƒ¶al-Saflieni Hypogeum that the earliest known skeuomorphism first occurred in the world. This architectural device served to define the aesthetics of the underworld in terms that well known in the larger megaliths. On Malta and Gozo, surface and subterranean architecture defined two worlds, which later, in the Greek world, would manifest themselves in the myth of Hades and the world of the living. In Malta, therefore, we encounter Neolithic architecture which is demonstrably not purely functional, but which was conceptual in design and purpose. Other structures Early Neolithic water wells from the Linear Pottery culture have been found in central Germany near Leipzig. These structures are built in timber with complicated woodworking joints at the edges and are dated between 5,200 and 5,100 BCE.Early Neolithic Water Wells Reveal the World's Oldest Wood Architecture Tegel W, Elburg R, Hakelberg D, St√§uble H, B√ºntgen U (2012) Early Neolithic Water Wells Reveal the World's Oldest Wood Architecture.

They were only loosely allied and fought without much apparent coordination or agreement; each power had its eye on a different part of France it wanted to appropriate after a French defeat, which never occurred. Noah Shusterman ‚Äì De Franse Revolutie (The French Revolution). Veen Media, Amsterdam, 2015. (Translation of: The French Revolution. Faith, Desire, and Politics. Routledge, London/New York, 2014.) Chapter 7 (p. 271‚Äì312) : The federalist revolts, the Vend√©e and the beginning of the Terror (summer‚Äìfall 1793). Relations between the French revolutionaries with neighbouring monarchies had deteriorated following the Declaration of Pillnitz in August 1791. Eight months later, following a vote of the revolutionary-led Legislative Assembly, France declared war on Prussia and Austria on 20 April 1792. In July 1792, an army under the Duke of Brunswick and composed mostly of Prussians joined the Austrian side and invaded France, only to be rebuffed at the Battle of Valmy in September. One day later the new French Republic was proclaimed. Subsequently, these powers made several invasions of France by land and sea, with Prussia and Austria attacking from the Austrian Netherlands and the Rhine, and the Kingdom of Great Britain supporting revolts in provincial France and laying siege to Toulon in October 1793. France suffered reverses (Battle of Neerwinden, 18 March 1793) and internal strife (War in the Vend√©e) and responded with draconian measures. The Committee of Public Safety formed (6 April 1793) and the lev√©e en masse drafted all potential soldiers aged 18 to 25 (August 1793). The new French armies counterattacked, repelled the invaders, and advanced beyond France. The French established the Batavian Republic as a sister republic (May 1795) and gained Prussian recognition of French control of the Left Bank of the Rhine by the first Peace of Basel. With the Treaty of Campo Formio, the Holy Roman Empire ceded the Austrian Netherlands to France and Northern Italy was turned into several French sister republics. Spain made a separate peace accord with France (Second Treaty of Basel) and the French Directory carried out plans to conquer more of the Holy Roman Empire (German States, and Austria under the same rule). North of the Alps, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen redressed the situation in 1796, but Napoleon carried all before him against Sardinia and Austria in northern Italy (1796‚Äì1797) near the Po Valley, culminating in the Treaty of Leoben and the Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797). The First Coalition collapsed, leaving only Britain in the field fighting against France. Background =Revolution in France= For the full article, see French Revolution As early as 1791, other monarchies in Europe were watching the developments in France with alarm, and considered intervening, either in support of Louis XVI or to take advantage of the chaos in France. The key figure, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, brother of the French Queen Marie Antoinette, had initially looked on the Revolution calmly. He became increasingly concerned as the Revolution grew more radical, although he still hoped to avoid war. On 27 August 1791, Leopold and King Frederick William II of Prussia, in consultation with √©migr√© French nobles, issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, which declared the concern of the monarchs of Europe for the well-being of Louis and his family, and threatened vague but severe consequences if anything should befall them. Although Leopold saw the Pillnitz Declaration as a way of taking action that would enable him to avoid actually doing anything about France, at least for the moment, Paris saw the Declaration as a serious threat and the revolutionary leaders denounced it. In addition to the ideological differences between France and the monarchical powers of Europe, disputes continued over the status of Imperial estates in Alsace, and the French authorities became concerned about the agitation of √©migr√© nobles abroad, especially in the Austrian Netherlands and in the minor states of Germany. In the end, France declared war on Austria first, with the Assembly voting for war on 20 April 1792, after the presentation of a long list of grievances by the newly appointed foreign minister Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez, who sought a war which might restore some popularity and authority to the King. 1792 Dumouriez prepared an invasion of the Austrian Netherlands, where he expected the local population to rise against Austrian rule. However, the revolution had thoroughly disorganized the French army, which had insufficient forces for the invasion. Its soldiers fled at the first sign of battle, deserting en masse, in one case murdering General Th√©obald Dillon. While the revolutionary government frantically raised fresh troops and reorganized its armies, an allied army under Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick assembled at Koblenz on the Rhine. The invasion commenced in July 1792. Brunswick's army, composed mostly of Prussian veterans, took the fortresses of Longwy and Verdun. The Duke then issued a declaration on 25 July 1792, which had been written by the brothers of Louis XVI, that declared his [Brunswick's] intent to restore the French King to his full powers, and to treat any person or town who opposed him as rebels to be condemned to death by martial law. This motivated the revolutionary army and government to oppose the Prussian invaders by any means necessary, and led almost immediately to the overthrow of the King by a crowd which stormed the Tuileries Palace. The invaders continued on, but at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792 they came to a stalemate against Dumouriez and Kellermann in which the highly professional French artillery distinguished itself. Although the battle was a tactical draw, it bought time for the revolutionaries and gave a great boost to French morale. Furthermore, the Prussians, facing a campaign longer and more costly than predicted, decided against the cost and risk of continued fighting, and determined to retreat from France to preserve their army. Meanwhile, the French had been successful on several other fronts, occupying the duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, while General Custine invaded Germany, capturing Speyer, Worms and Mainz along the Rhine, and reaching as far as Frankfurt. Dumouriez went on the offensive in Belgium once again, winning a great victory over the Austrians at Jemappes on 6 November 1792, and occupying the entire country by the beginning of winter. 1793 The British evacuation of Toulon in December 1793 On 21 January the revolutionary government executed Louis XVI after a trial. This united all European governments, including Spain, Naples, and the Netherlands against the Revolution. France declared war against Britain and the Netherlands on 1 February 1793 and soon afterwards against Spain. In the course of the year 1793 the Holy Roman Empire (on 23 March), the kings of Portugal and Naples, and the Grand-Duke of Tuscany declared war against France. Thus the First Coalition was formed. France introduced a new levy of hundreds of thousands of men, beginning a French policy of using mass conscription to deploy more of its manpower than the other states could, and remaining on the offensive so that these mass armies could commandeer war material from the territory of their enemies. The French government sent Citizen Genet to the United States to encourage them into entering the war on France's side. The newly formed nation refused and remained neutral throughout the conflict. After a victory in the Battle of Neerwinden in March, the Austrians suffered twin defeats at the battles of Wattignies and Wissembourg. British land forces were defeated at the Battle of Hondschoote in September. 1794 The Glorious First of June, 1 June 1794 1794 brought increased success to the revolutionary armies. A major victory against combined coalition forces at the Battle of Fleurus gained all of Belgium and the Rhineland for France. Although the British navy maintained its supremacy at sea, it was unable to support effectively any land operations after the fall of the Belgian provinces. The Prussians were slowly driven out of the eastern departments and by the end of the year they had retired from any active part in the war. Against Spain, the French made successful incursions in both Catalonia and Navarre. Action extended into the French colonies in the West Indies. A British fleet successfully captured Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadeloupe, although a French fleet arrived later in the year and recovered the latter. 1795 After seizing the Low Countries in a surprise winter attack, France established the Batavian Republic as a puppet state. Even before the close of 1794 the king of Prussia retired from any active part in the war, and on 5 April 1795 he concluded with France the Peace of Basel, which recognized France's occupation of the left bank of the Rhine. The new French-dominated Dutch government bought peace by surrendering Dutch territory to the south of that river. A treaty of peace between France and Spain followed in July. The grand duke of Tuscany had been admitted to terms in February. The coalition thus fell into ruin and France proper would be free from invasion for many years.One of more of the preceding sentences text from a publication now in the public domain: Britain attempted to reinforce the rebels in the Vend√©e by landing French Royalist troops at Quiberon, but failed, and attempts to overthrow the government at Paris by force were foiled by the military garrison led by Napoleon Bonaparte, leading to the establishment of the Directory. On the Rhine frontier, General Pichegru, negotiating with the exiled Royalists, betrayed his army and forced the evacuation of Mannheim and the failure of the siege of Mainz by Jourdan. 1796 Strategic situation in Europe in 1796 The French prepared a great advance on three fronts, with Jourdan and Jean Victor Marie Moreau on the Rhine and the newly promoted Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy. The three armies were to link up in Tyrol and march on Vienna. In the Rhine Campaign of 1796, Jourdan and Moreau crossed the Rhine River and advanced into Germany. Jourdan advanced as far as Amberg in late August while Moreau reached Bavaria and the edge of Tyrol by September. However Jourdan was defeated by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and both armies were forced to retreat back across the Rhine. Napoleon, on the other hand, was successful in a daring invasion of Italy. In the Montenotte Campaign, he separated the armies of Sardinia and Austria, defeating each one in turn, and then forced a peace on Sardinia. Following this, his army captured Milan and started the Siege of Mantua. Bonaparte defeated successive Austrian armies sent against him under Johann Peter Beaulieu, Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and J√≥zsef Alvinczi while continuing the siege. The rebellion in the Vend√©e was also crushed in 1796 by Louis Lazare Hoche. Hoche's subsequent attempt to land a large invasion force in Munster to aid the United Irishmen was unsuccessful. 1797 Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli, 14 January 1797 On 2 February Napoleon finally captured Mantua, with the Austrians surrendering 18,000 men. Archduke Charles of Austria was unable to stop Napoleon from invading the Tyrol, and the Austrian government sued for peace in April. At the same time there was a new French invasion of Germany under Moreau and Hoche. On 22 February, a French invasion force consisting of 1,400 troops from the La Legion Noire (The Black Legion) under the command of Irish American Colonel William Tate landed near Fishguard in Wales. They were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 British reservists, militia and sailors under the command of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor. After brief clashes with the local civilian population and Lord Cawdor's forces on 23 February, Tate was forced into an unconditional surrender by 24 February. This would be the only battle fought on British soil during the Revolutionary Wars. Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio in October, ceding Belgium to France and recognizing French control of the Rhineland and much of Italy. The ancient Republic of Venice was partitioned between Austria and France. This ended the War of the First Coalition, although Great Britain and France remained at war.

It is situated in the Weald, at the edge of Ashdown Forest, in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is 7 miles (11 km) south-west of Royal Tunbridge Wells and 33 miles (53 km) south of London. It has road and rail links and is served by a town council. It is the most populous inland town in East Sussex, with over 20,000 people. History All Saints Church Various derivations for the town's name have been put forward.A newspaper article of 1933 suggested that, since iron smelting was carried on here, it was derived from the Irish for iron, which is croe. Early local documents give the names Crohbergh, Crowbergh, Croweborowghe, Crowbarrow and Crowboro. Croh in Old English meant saffron or golden-yellow colour, and berg meant hill. Gorse grows in profusion in the Crowborough Beacon area, and its yellow flowers might well have contributed to the meaning. In 1734 Sir Henry Fermor, a local benefactor, bequeathed money for a church and charity school for the benefit of the \\"very ignorant and heathenish people\\" that lived in the part of Rotherfield \\"in or near a place called Crowborough and Ashdown Forest\\". The church, dedicated to All Saints, and primary school still survive today. The railway arrived in 1868, leading to significant growth of the town. By 1880, the town had grown so much that the ecclesiastical parish of All Saints was separated from that of St Denys, Rotherfield. In the late 19th century Crowborough was promoted as a health resort based on its high elevation, the rolling hills and surrounding forest. Estate Agents even called it \\"Scotland in Sussex\\". The town's golf course opened in 1895, followed by a fire station and hospital in 1900. From 1942 to 1982, a site near Crowborough hosted notable radio transmitters, including the Aspidistra transmitter during World War II and, after the war, the BBC External Service broadcasts to Europe transmitters. Governance Crowborough became an ecclesiastical parish in 1880: previously it had been part of Rotherfield. A civil parish was established on 6 April 1905; the parish council was renamed as a Town Council on 24 May 1988.The Weald of Kent, Surrey and Sussex Until 2012, Crowborough shared the headquarters of Wealden District Council with Hailsham, 14 miles (22 km) to the south. The Council moved all of their operations to Hailsham in 2012 although East Sussex County Council still operates a library service from the Pine Grove building. In July 2014, the Crowborough Community Association put in a bid to buy Pine Grove to retain the library and develop the rest of the building as an \\"enterprise hub\\". Geography Crowborough is located in the northern part of East Sussex, around from the county border with Kent. The town is south of central London. The nearest major towns are Royal Tunbridge Wells, to the north-east; Brighton, to the south-west; and Crawley, to the west. The county town of Lewes is to the south-west. The town is located on the eastern edge of the Ashdown Forest, an ancient area of open heathland which is protected for its ecological importance and was the setting for A. A. Milne's stories about Winnie-the-Pooh. The highest point in the town is 242 metres above sea level. This summit is the highest point of the High Weald and second highest point in East Sussex (the highest is Ditchling Beacon). Its relative height is 159 m, meaning Crowborough qualifies as one of England's Marilyns. The summit is not marked on the ground. The town has grown from a series of previously separate villages and hamlets including Jarvis Brook, Poundfield, Whitehill, Stone Cross and Alderbrook, Sweet Haws and Steel Cross. Transport The main road through Crowborough is the A26, which runs through the centre of the town. From Crowborough, the A26 runs north-east to Mereworth via Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge. To the south, it runs to Newhaven, via Uckfield and Lewes. Two B roads run through the town. The B2100 starts at the junction with the A26 (Crowborough Cross) and runs east to Lamberhurst via Jarvis Brook, Rotherfield, Mark Cross and Wadhurst. The B2157 Green Lane is a short link between Steel Cross and Crowborough Hill, within the town. Crowborough railway station is located in Jarvis Brook at the bottom of Crowborough Hill. Trains run on the Oxted line which is operated by Southern, providing a direct link with London Bridge, East Croydon, Edenbridge and Uckfield. The journey time to London Bridge is approximately one hour. A regular, frequent bus service passes through the town, linking it with Brighton and Tunbridge Wells. Education Crowborough has one secondary school, Beacon Academy, six primary schools listed below, and two independent preparatory schools. * Ashdown Primary School * High Hurstwood Church of England (controlled) School * Jarvis Brook County Primary School * St Johns Church of England (aided) School * St Mary's Roman Catholic School * Sir Henry Fermor (aided) Church of England School * Grove Park School Whitehill Infant School and Herne Junior School merged in September 2015 to create the all- through Ashdown Primary school.  Media  The local paper is the Kent and Sussex Courier published in Tunbridge Wells. Owned by the regional newspaper publisher Local World, there are six editions of the paper including a Sussex edition. South East Today is the BBC regional television news programme serving Kent and Sussex. In 2014 a local news website (Hyperlocal) called CrowboroughLife.com was established by Stephan Butler. Health Crowborough Hospital is a small cottage hospital with a midwife-led maternity unit. It has been threatened with closure numerous times, but services are still offered, in part due to a strong local campaign. Non-maternity services are provided at hospitals in Pembury and Haywards Heath. Sport and leisure = Sports teams and associations = The town's main football club is Crowborough Athletic F.C., who are based at the Crowborough Community Stadium and currently play in The Southern Counties East Premier. Jarvis Brook F.C., founded in 1888, run four senior sides, the highest of which plays in the Mid Sussex Football League Premier Division. Crowborough Rugby Football Club won promotion from the Sussex leagues in 2006 and now plays in the London South 2 division. Crowborough Tennis and Squash Club has nine outdoor all-weather tennis courts and four squash courts, as well as offering racketball and other sporting activities. The club competes in Sussex County leagues in both tennis and squash. The Club is open to the public for Pay and Play tennis, squash and racketball. There are also a host of social events from quizzes to live music. Crowborough Netball is a coaching club formed, with help from Crowborough Town Council, in 2013. The club coaches children and adults from those new to the game to league players at Crowborough Leisure Centre, Beacon Academy's Green Lane Gym, and Goldsmiths outdoor court. The club arranges friendly, fun matches and competitions for all ages. 1st Crowborough Scout Group comprises 3 Beavers, 3 Cubs and 3 Scouts sections. = Recreation = Crowborough has several recreation grounds, including Goldsmiths Recreation Ground, which was given to the parish by private owners in 1937. The town council has since purchased additional land and has developed the ground into a recreation centre. There are a sports centre with swimming pool; a boating lake; and a miniature railway. Crowborough Common is an ancient common covering over 220 acres, or about 90 hectares, to which the public was granted a legal right of access \\"for the taking of air and exercise\\" in 1936. The common is owned by Crowborough Beacon Golf Club. Most of the common is heathland and woodland. In 2012 Wealden District Council refused permission for the golf club to build a new car park in woodland on the common after a campaign involving local residents and organisations including the Open Spaces Society. On 1 February 2013 the Club served notice to DEFRA to revoke the Section 193 agreement which governed the public's right of access on the Common. On 7 February 2013 DEFRA confirmed the revocation of the rights. Due to Health and Safety reasons, not least of which is the outcome of a court case known as the 'Nidry Castle' case members of the public are requested to keep to official public footpaths and bridleways to mitigate the possible incidence of accident and injury. The club however are in consultation with Wealden District Council and other interested parties to endeavor to relocate some footpaths to make it safer for members of the public who use such footpaths. In addition, to give better access to the common for members of the public, the club are looking at ways of introducing some permissive pathways to give access to areas not served by public footpaths. The club, with the assistance of Natural England, have embarked upon a 10-year programme to restore as much of the common as possible to heathland so this endangered environment will be preserved for future generations. Adjacent to the 4th fairway is a memorial to nine Canadian soldiers of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment who were killed by a flying bomb on 5 July 1944. Crowborough Country Park is a 16-acre (6 hectare) nature reserve located in the southern part of Crowborough. The park was previously a clay quarry serving the Crowborough Brickworks which closed in 1980. The topography of the site is evidence of its industrial past. The site of the brickworks was developed into Farningham Road industrial estate and housing in the area of Osborne Road. For nearly 30 years the quarry was left to natural regeneration and local people used it for informal play, with stories of swimming in the ponds and losing Wellington boots in the wet areas of the site. In 2008 Crowborough Town Council acquired the site to develop it for informal recreation and also to enhance the site's biodiversity. In 2008 work began in the Country Park, with a stone track and bridges installed. The site was declared a Local Nature Reserve in 2009 ensuring the future management of the site for the benefit of the wildlife and for people to enjoy quiet recreation. The Crowborough Players, established in 1933, are the resident community drama group at the 300-seater hall at Crowborough Community Centre (opened in June 2012). After resting between 2009 and 2011, the group was relaunched in 2012 and has 100+ members [May 2014]. The Players put on the town's first community pantomime, Cinderella, in December 2012, followed by Dick Whittington in December 2013 (50 actors, 28 dancers and 126 people involved in the production). Notable people The statue of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at Crowborough Cross Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859‚Äì1930), the author of the Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories, lived at Windlesham Manor in Crowborough for the last 23 years of his life. He moved to Crowborough from Surrey in 1907 when he married his second wife, whose family lived next door at Little Windlesham. Windlesham Manor is now a retirement home. Sir Arthur was a past Captain of Crowborough Beacon Golf Club in 1910 and Lady Conan Doyle was Ladies Captain in 1911. Conan Doyle was initially buried vertically in the grounds of the manor, but later interred with his first wife at Minstead in the New Forest. His statue stands at Crowborough Cross, in the town centre. A Sherlock Holmes festival was held in Crowborough for several years running in the mid-1990s, reportedly attracting up to 25,000 visitors. Conan Doyle is commemorated in the town through street names such as Watson Way and Sherlock Shaw, and Conan Way.

Cox grew up in the vicinity of the town. Local traditions A main event in the town's calendar is its annual celebration of Guy Fawkes Night on 5 November. An average of 5000 people descend upon Goldsmiths Recreation Ground for this town council event. Donations on the night are traditionally collected by the local Lions Club and now also the Rotary Club, and donated to the mayor's charity. However this is overshadowed by carnival night, which sees the whole of the town taking to the streets on the second Saturday in September. This is run by the town's Bonfire and Carnival Society. It involves a f√™te on Chapel green during the day, followed by a torchlight parade led by the carnival princess in the evening, with various Sussex bonfire societies joining the march round the streets. The evening culminates in a bonfire on Chapel Green or sometimes there have been fireworks at Goldsmiths Recreation Ground. Street collections are received on the night and are given to around six different local charities each year. On average the society raises about ¬£2,000‚Äì¬£3,000 per year. This tradition dates back around 70 years and is part of Sussex Bonfire Tradition the largest event of which being the Lewes Bonfire celebrations on 5 November. The town council also puts on a summer fair and a Christmas fair. A summer fun day is organised by the Crowborough Chamber of Commerce, and Crowborough Hospital has a f√™te every August Bank Holiday. There is a farmers' market on the fourth Saturday of the month. and a French Market held as part of the Chamber of Commerce's Fun Day in June. As well as this for the last few years Sussex day has been celebrated on 16 June with a small fete in Chapel Green According to local legend, Jarvis Brook Road is haunted by a bag of soot. The spectral bag pursues people walking along the road by night. Twin towns The town is twinned with: * Montargis, France * Horwich, Greater Manchester, England On 22 April 1990, Crowborough and Horwich became the first towns in England to be twinned with other English towns.

In accordance with its mission, the school's motto was originally \\"and gladly wold he lerne and gladly teche,\\" in the Middle English spelling of Geoffrey Chaucer which has since been updated to modern English in the gender- neutral form \\"Gladly we Learn and Teach.\\" Academics and organizations Founded as a teachers' college, the university now offers a range of programs at the bachelor, master, and doctoral levels. Illinois State is accredited by the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The teacher preparation programs are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education and certified by the Illinois State Board of Education. In addition, 22 programs hold discipline-based accreditation. =Academic colleges= * College of Applied Science and Technology * College of Arts and Sciences * College of Business * College of Education * College of Fine Arts * Mennonite College of Nursing Rankings In 2020, U.S. News & World Report ranked Illinois State University (tied for) 197 among a combined list of America's best 310 private and public \\"national universities\\" and (tied for) 98 among 133 public \\"national universities\\" in the United States that qualified for the list.

Demographics As of the fall of 2019, total on-campus enrollment was 20,878, with 18,250 undergraduate students and 2,628 graduate students.Illinois State University. (2019). Planning, Research, and Policy Analysis: Census Day Enrollment (Report 2019 Fall Semester). Normal, Illinois: Illinois State University 56.5 percent of students are female, while 43.5 percent are male. About 28.8% of all students were from minority groups. Of the 558 international students 422 are graduate students. International students come from 69 different countries. The average new beginning student had an ACT score of 23.7. The student-faculty ratio is 18 to one. The Quad John W. Cook Hall on the quad's west side The Illinois State University campus quadrangle is compact compared with other large universities, with buildings spaced closely together around a rectangular center lawn. The Quad is a popular site for small special events including movies and concerts and University Program Board's Festival ISU, where campus organizations set up tables with games, prizes, and information about their organizations. Lined with benches and shady trees, the site is a popular spot for students to relax, study, and play informal games of sports. The ISU Quad is also host to the Fell Arboretum, which is part of a 490-acre site that represents over 154 species of trees from the state of Illinois. Trees on the north side of the quad are from Northern Illinois and those on the south side of the quad from southern parts of the state. The Fell Arboretum won the Tree Campus USA award in 2008. Milner Library Milner Library Milner Library has a collection of more than 1.5 million volumes and an ever-increasing number of electronic materials accessible by the Internet to students and faculty. The library's collection is distinguished by materials related to educational theory and policy, curriculum development, and issues related to special education and assistive technology. The Special Collections include extensive Circus and Allied Arts materials and a children's literature collection that features more than 100 first edition volumes signed by author Lois Lenski. Milner Library is also a selective federal depository for government information. Combined Milner's collections contribute to the university's relatively high standing in regional, national, and world rankings. In 2007, the library received the John Cotton Dana Library Public Relations Award, an award given to only seven libraries nationwide. Milner Library administers the Dr. Jo Ann Rayfield University Archives, which houses selected official records from university departments and organizations, faculty and student publications and local history materials including a collection from the Adlai Stevenson family. The archives also houses an Illinois Regional Archives Depository (IRAD). Additional library facilities include book storage both on and off- site as well as a preservation department. The Milner Library was named for Angeline \\"Ange\\" Vernon Milner (1856‚Äì1928), a Bloomington-Normal native and the first full-time librarian of Illinois State Normal University. Milner is credited with organizing the university's initial collection of more than 40,000 items and was a prolific author of more than seventy articles and short monographs in library and education journals during her tenure as University Librarian from 1890 to 1927. The library building, the third in the university's history, opened in 1976. Residence halls Illinois State University's seven residence halls house about 6,000 students. Administered by the ISU's University Housing Services, they include lifestyle floors that serve residents with shared interests. =Watterson= Watterson Towers is not only the largest residence hall on campus, it is also one of the world's tallest student residence halls, and provides the highest vantage point in Illinois between Chicago and St. Louis.Bloomington-Normal Community ‚Äì Illinois State University Watterson features areas for wellness, quiet, substance- free, and restricted visitation. Built between 1968 and 1970, the facility is named for Arthur W. Watterson, a geography faculty member and chair. Watterson went through a massive renovation from March 2010 through August 2012. Watterson's twin towers have five \\"houses\\" apiece. Each \\"house\\" has five floors with each floor divided into four suites. Each of the 10 houses was named after a former United States Secretary of State. In 2020, the houses were renamed due to 8 of the 10 secretaries having had slaves. =East Campus= Hewett and Manchester Hall are in East Campus. Built in 1966, they were named after Edwin C. Hewett, the third University president, and Orson L. Manchester, Illinois State Normal University dean from 1911 to 1928. Both are for the most part coed, with specialty floors designated as all male or all female. Until recently, Hewett was all-female. Between both Hewett and Manchester, there are floors dedicated to students majoring in art, business, communication, co-sciences, curriculum and instruction, Geo-Environmental, Honors, Information Technology, Math, and Music. Other floors are dedicated to students with interests and preferences such as service and leadership, substance-free, quiet, and international house. These residence halls were renovated in 2008‚Äì09. During this renovation, the dining center in the basement between each hall was transformed into the Julia N. Visor Center which is dedicated to helping students achieve academic success through free tutoring and other services. Manchester Hall and the Vrooman Center =West Campus= Haynie, Wilkins, and Wright Hall are in West Campus, next to Redbird Arena and Hancock Stadium. Also known as \\"The Tri Towers\\", they feature floors for ROTC, Wellness, Substance-Free, and Quiet. These halls are the most remote residence facilities on campus and are known for housing a majority of athletes because of their proximity to practice areas. They were built in 1962 and named for Martha D.L. Haynie, the first female Illinois State Normal University professor, Daniel Wilkins, principal of the Female School Institute of Bloomington in the 1850s, and Simeon Wright, one of the university's founders. Haynie, Wilkins and Wright Hall =Cardinal Court= In 2012, the university opened the new Cardinal Court Apartments to replace a complex by the same name and on the same site built in 1959. Much like the old Cardinal Court, the new Cardinal Court provides apartment-style living combined with the benefits of university housing. Besides simply being more modern, the primary difference is that the old Cardinal Court had been reserved for married couples and graduate students. =South Campus= Until recently, there were several residence halls in what has been known as \\"South Campus\\". There are no longer any students housed in the area now, and the buildings were demolished in the summer of 2016. Hamilton and Whitten Hall (aka \\"Ham- Whit) shared a joint entrance and front desk. They featured lifestyle floors such as Upper-class and Graduate, Student Nursing, and Speech Pathology and Audiology. Constructed in 1959, the facility was named for Alma H. Hamilton, the first recipient of an Illinois State Normal University bachelor degree, and Jennie Whitten, the former head of the Foreign Language Department. Hamilton-Whitten Residence Hall and Feeny Dining Center Atkin and Colby Hall, though built later than \\"Ham-Whit\\", were essentially a mirror image of the former, and shared a dining center with the same. Built in 1962 as female-only dorms, they were converted to co-ed. They were named for Edith Irene Atkin, Illinois State Normal University mathematics professor from 1909 to 1940 and June Rose Colby, English professor from 1892 to 1932. =Central Campus= Three residence halls, Dunn, Barton, and Walker Hall, were demolished in 2008 to provide space for the Student Fitness, Kinesiology and Recreation Center. Student life The school publishes two newspapers, The Vidette and The Indy, the latter being an alternative weekly publication. ISU owns a public radio station WGLT (\\"News, Blues and All That Jazz\\"), which broadcasts on 89.1 in Normal, 103.5 in Peoria, and by streaming audio. The call letters are from keywords of the school's motto: \\"Gladly-Learn-Teach.\\" The university also maintains a student radio station, WZND. On January 20, 2010, WZND changed its format from a dual format (Rock and Jamz) to a college shuffle format. The station broadcasts on 103.3 FM, channels 4 & 5 in the residence halls and on the web. TV-10, a part of the School of Communication, provides the only live local television newscast produced entirely in Bloomington-Normal. =Student organizations= Illinois State is home to over 350 registered student organizations or \\"RSOs\\". These organizations can range from intramural sports to branches of nationally recognized student organizations. Every year RSOs are able to advertise themselves to students during Festival ISU where RSOs can reserve a booth on the quad where they can meet passing students looking to join an organization. Illinois State University also boasts one of the largest student spirit organizations in the United States, RED ALERT. This registered student organization has over 4,100 members, roughly one fourth of the student body. The group was founded in 2006 to promote student involvement in university athletics and has grown exponentially. ISU is also the home of the Gamma Phi Circus, the oldest collegiate circus in the world, founded in 1929. It is one of two collegiate circuses in the US; the other is run by Florida State University. The Student Government Association at Illinois State University is a unique governing body for the ISU Student Body. It is unique in that it sends 21 voting student members to serve on the Academic Senate which is composed of student, faculty, staff, and administrators. This place in the shared governance of the university is rare among universities giving ISU Students a major voice on campus. =Greek life= The Illinois State University Greek community was established in 1967. Currently about 14% of the student population are active members of Greek Life. Greek organizations provide students with a wide range of academic, social, and leadership opportunities. In the 2015‚Äì2016 academic year fraternity and sorority members collectively raised $175,054 for charities and volunteered 44,864 hours of community service. Fraternity and Sorority members had an average GPA of 3.02 in 2016.

In 1995, 1999, and 2000 it won the National Forensic Association team championship and in 2005 its team won the American Forensic Association team championship. Illinois State has been selected as the host of the 2011 NFA National Championship. Famous alumni include Nelsan Ellis of HBO's True Blood. The Student Fitness Center and Kinesiology and Recreation building completed in 2011 The Illinois state co-ed cheerleading team has competed at both NCA and UCA nationals in co-ed Division 1. In 2002 they placed 2nd in the nation in co-ed Division 1 at UCA nationals in Orlando, FL. In 2001 they placed 3rd in the nation in co-ed division 1 at UCA nationals in Orlando, FL. They have appeared on ESPN and in American Cheerleader Magazine. The Illinois State Club Baseball team was ranked No. 18 in the country in the spring of 2010 for much of the year, but ultimately finished second in the Great Lakes South Conference behind the University of Illinois. The Redbirds compiled a 15‚Äì5 overall record, including 9‚Äì4 in conference. Horton Field House The Illinois State University Mock Trial Team has enjoyed continue success since its inception in 1987. The team competes in intercollegiate tournaments sponsored by AMTA (American Mock Trial Association). In 2004, they won the National Championship after defeating Gonzaga University in the final round. The team is consistently ranked as a top 5 team in the Midwest. The ISU Solar Car Team was founded in 2005 and has earned two 2nd place (2011, 2013) a 3rd place (2015) a 4th place (2012) and a 5th place (2009) finish in the Formula Sun Grand Prix. Athletics The school's fight song is \\"Go, You Redbirds,\\" a song written specifically for ISU and frequently played at sporting events. The Alma Mater song, also played at sporting events from time to time, is \\"Glory Hast Thou,\\" written to the tune of Haydn's \\"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser,\\" and better known as the tune used for \\"Deutschlandlied,\\" the German national anthem. Folklore and legends The ghost of Angeline Vernon Milner, the university's first librarian, is said to haunt the former library building, now called Williams Hall. Built in 1940, the building was named in honor of Milner who served as University Librarian from 1890 until her retirement in 1927. Beginning in the 1990s, personnel working in the book storage and archives facilities formerly housed in Williams Hall reported encounters with what they believe to be the ghost of Milner.Angie Milner: The Woman, the Librarian, the Ghost.\\" The Vidette October 27, 2004Favorite Haunt; National Cable Show to Tell ISU Ghost Story.\\" The Pantagraph October 22, 2004Library's Founder said to Haunt Stacks.\\" The Pantagraph October 30, 2000Milner Played Great Role in Developing ISU Library.\\" The Pantagraph October 30, 2000 Points of interest The historic Eyestone School with Redbird Arena in the background. * Fell Arboretum * Constitution Trail * Bowling and Billiard Center * Redbird Arena * Bone Student Center ** Braden Auditorium * Center for the Performing Arts * Ewing Cultural Center * Normal Public Library * Milner Library * Illinois State University Planetarium * Student Fitness and Kinesiology Recreation Building * State Farm Hall of Business * University Galleries *Intercollegiate Biomathematics Alliance: Research Center * John W.

As successor states of the Visigothic Kingdom (418‚Äì721), Aquitania (Aquitaine) and Languedoc (Toulouse) inherited both Visigothic laws and Roman Law, which together allowed women more rights than their contemporaries would enjoy until the 20th century. Particularly under the Liber Judiciorum as codified 642/643 and expanded by the Code of Recceswinth in 653, women could inherit land and title and manage it independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, represent themselves and bear witness in court from the age of 14, and arrange for their own marriages after the age of 20.Klapisch-Zuber, Christiane; A History of Women: Book II Silences of the Middle Ages, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England. 1992, 2000 (5th printing). Chapter 6, \\"Women in the Fifth to the Tenth Century\\" by Suzanne Fonay Wemple, pg 74. According to Wemple, Visigothic women of Spain and the Aquitaine could inherit land and title and manage it independently of their husbands, and dispose of it as they saw fit if they had no heirs, and represent themselves in court, appear as witnesses (by the age of 14), and arrange their own marriages by the age of twenty As a consequence, male- preference primogeniture was the practiced succession law for the nobility. Coronation The Merovingian kings and dukes of Aquitaine had their capital at Toulouse. The Carolingian kings used different capitals situated further north. In 765, Pepin the Short bestowed the captured golden banner of the Aquitainian duke, Waiffre, on the Abbey of Saint Martial in Limoges. Pepin I of Aquitaine was buried in Poitiers. Charles the Child was crowned at Limoges and buried at Bourges. When Aquitaine briefly asserted its independence after the death of Charles the Fat, it was Ranulf II of Poitou who took the royal title. In the late tenth century, Louis the Indolent was crowned at Brioude. The Aquitainian ducal coronation procedure is preserved in a late twelfth- century ordo (formula) from Saint-√âtienne in Limoges, based on an earlier Romano-German ordo. In the early thirteenth century a commentary was added to this ordo, which emphasised Limoges as the capital of Aquitaine. The ordo indicated that the duke received a silk mantle, coronet, banner, sword, spurs, and the ring of Saint Valerie.

Homage of Edward I of England (kneeling) to Philip IV of France (seated), by Jean Fouquet. As Duke of Aquitaine, Edward was a vassal to the French king From 1152, the Duchy of Aquitaine was held by the Plantagenets, who also ruled England as independent monarchs and held other territories in France by separate inheritance (see Plantagenet Empire). The Plantagenets were often more powerful than the kings of France, and their reluctance to do homage to the kings of France for their lands in France was one of the major sources of conflict in medieval Western Europe. = House of Plantagenet = *Henry I (Henry II of England) (1152‚Äì89), also King of England, duke in right of his wife Eleanor. *Richard I Lionheart (1189‚Äì99), also King of England, duke in right of his mother. *John I (1199‚Äì1216), also King of England, duke in right of his mother until her death in 1204. *Henry II (Henry III of England) (1216‚Äì72), also King of England. *Edward I Longshanks (1272‚Äì1307), also King of England. *Edward II (1307‚Äì25), also King of England. *Edward III (1325‚Äì62), also King of England. Richard the Lionheart was outlived by his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine. In 1189, she acted as regent for the Duchy while he was on crusade ‚Äî a position he resumed on his return to Europe. Plantagenet rulers of Aquitaine In 1337, King Philip VI of France reclaimed the fief of Aquitaine from Edward III, King of England. Edward in turn claimed the title of King of France, by right of his descent from his maternal grandfather King Philip IV of France. This triggered the Hundred Years' War, in which both the Plantagenets and the House of Valois claimed supremacy over Aquitaine. In 1360, both sides signed the Treaty of Bretigny, in which Edward renounced the French crown but remained sovereign Lord of Aquitaine (rather than merely duke). However, when the treaty was broken in 1369, both these English claims and the war resumed. In 1362, King Edward III, as Lord of Aquitaine, made his eldest son Edward, Prince of Wales, Prince of Aquitaine. *Edward, the Black Prince (1362‚Äì72), first son of Edward III and Queen Philippa, also Prince of Wales. In 1390, King Richard II, son of Edward the Black Prince, appointed his uncle John of Gaunt Duke of Aquitaine. This grant expired upon the Duke's death, and the dukedom reverted to the Crown. Regardless, due to Henry IV's seizure of the crown, he still came into possession of the dukedom. \\"Would the grant of Aquitaine to John of Gaunt in 1399 have been inherited by Henry Bolingbroke had the latter not been exiled by Richard II?\\" at researchgate.net *John of Gaunt (1390‚Äì1399), fourth son of Edward III and Queen Philippa, also Duke of Lancaster. *Henry IV of England (1399‚Äì1400), seized the throne of England, to whose demesne the duchy had reverted upon the death of his father John of Gaunt, but ceded it to his son upon becoming King of England. *Henry V of England (1400‚Äì1422), son of Henry IV, also King of England 1413‚Äì22. Henry V continued to rule over Aquitaine as King of England and Lord of Aquitaine. He invaded France and emerged victorious at the siege of Harfleur and the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He succeeded in obtaining the French crown for his family by the Treaty of Troyes in 1420. Henry V died in 1422, when his son Henry VI inherited the French throne at the age of less than a year; his reign saw the gradual loss of English control of France. Valois and Bourbon dukes of Aquitaine The Valois kings of France, claiming supremacy over Aquitaine, granted the title of duke to their heirs, the Dauphins. *John II (1345‚Äì50), son of Philip VI of France, acceded in 1350 as King of France. *Charles, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne (1392?‚Äì1401), son of Charles VI of France, Dauphin. *Louis (1401‚Äì15), son of Charles VI of France, Dauphin. With the end of the Hundred Years' War, Aquitaine returned under direct rule of the king of France and remained in the possession of the king. Only occasionally was the duchy or the title of duke granted to another member of the dynasty. *Charles, Duc de Berry (1469‚Äì72), son of Charles VII of France. *Xavier (1753‚Äì54), second son of Louis, Dauphin of France. The Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, son of Alfonso XIII of Spain, was one of the Legitimist pretenders to the French throne; as such he named his son, Gonzalo, Duke of Aquitaine (1972‚Äì2000); Gonzalo had no legitimate children.

Overview  Electric trains that collect their current from overhead lines use a device such as a pantograph, bow collector or trolley pole. It presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire, the contact wire. Current collectors are electrically conductive and allow current to flow through to the train or tram and back to the feeder station through the steel wheels on one or both running rails. Non-electric locomotives (such as diesels) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line, although there may be difficulties with overhead clearance. Alternative electrical power transmission schemes for trains include third rail, ground-level power supply, batteries and electromagnetic induction.  Construction  Lineworkers on a maintenance of way vehicle repairing overhead lines (Poland) Toronto: Two runners for pantographs flank the trolley pole frog. To achieve good high-speed current collection, it is necessary to keep the contact wire geometry within defined limits. This is usually achieved by supporting the contact wire from a second wire known as the ' (in the US & Canada) or catenary (in the UK). This wire approximates the natural path of a wire strung between two points, a catenary curve, thus the use of \\"catenary\\" to describe this wire or sometimes the whole system. This wire is attached to the contact wire at regular intervals by vertical wires known as \\"droppers\\" or \\"drop wires\\". It is supported regularly at structures, by a pulley, link or clamp. The whole system is then subjected to mechanical tension. As the pantograph moves along under the contact wire, the carbon insert on top of the pantograph becomes worn with time. On straight track, the contact wire is zigzagged slightly to the left and right of the centre from each support to the next so that the insert wears evenly, thus preventing any notches. On curves, the \\"straight\\" wire between the supports causes the contact point to cross over the surface of the pantograph as the train travels around the curve. The movement of the contact wire across the head of the pantograph is called the \\"sweep\\". The zigzagging of the overhead line is not required for trolley poles. For tramways, a contact wire without a messenger wire is used. Depot areas tend to have only a single wire and are known as \\"simple equipment\\" or \\"trolley wire\\". When overhead line systems were first conceived, good current collection was possible only at low speeds, using a single wire. To enable higher speeds, two additional types of equipment were developed: *Stitched equipment uses an additional wire at each support structure, terminated on either side of the messenger/catenary wire. *Compound equipment uses a second support wire, known as the \\"auxiliary\\", between the messenger/catenary wire and the contact wire. Droppers support the auxiliary from the messenger wire, while additional droppers support the contact wire from the auxiliary. The auxiliary wire can be of a more conductive but less wear-resistant metal, increasing transmission efficiency. Earlier dropper wires provided physical support of the contact wire without joining the catenary and contact wires electrically. Modern systems use current-carrying droppers, eliminating the need for separate wires. The present transmission system originated about 100 years ago. A simpler system was proposed in the 1970s by the Pirelli Construction Company, consisting of a single wire embedded at each support for of its length in a clipped, extruded aluminum beam with the wire contact face exposed. A somewhat higher tension than used before clipping the beam yielded a deflected profile for the wire that could be easily handled at by a pneumatic servo pantograph with only 3 g acceleration. = Parallel overhead lines = A switch in parallel overhead lines Trolleybus wire switch An electrical circuit requires at least two conductors. Trams and railways use the overhead line as one side of the circuit and the steel rails as the other side of the circuit. For a trolleybus or a trolleytruck, no rails are available for the return current, as the vehicles use rubber tyres on the road surface. Trolleybuses use a second parallel overhead line for the return, and two trolley poles, one contacting each overhead wire. (Pantographs are generally incompatible with parallel overhead lines.) The circuit is completed by using both wires. Parallel overhead wires are also used on the rare railways with three-phase AC railway electrification.  Types of wires  In the Soviet Union the following types of wires/cables were used.–ò—Å–∞–µ–≤, –ò. –ü.; –§—Ä–∞–π—Ñ–µ–ª—å–¥, –ê. –í.; \\"–ë–µ—Å–µ–¥—ã –æ–± —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–π –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–µ\\" (Discussions about the electric railway) –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, \\"–¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç\\", 1989. pp, 186-7 For the contact wire, cold drawn solid copper was used to insure good conductivity. The wire is not round but has grooves at the sides to allow the hangers to attach to it. Sizes were (in cross section area) 85, 100, or 150 mm2. To make the wire stronger, 0.04% tin might be added. The wire must resist the heat generated by arcing and thus such wires should never be spliced by thermal means. The messenger (or catenary) wire needs to be both strong and have good conductivity. They used multi-strand wires (or cables) with 19 strands in each cable (or wire). Copper, aluminum, and/or steel were used for the strands. All the 19 strands could be of the same metal or some strands could be of steel for strength with the remaining strands of aluminum or copper for conductivity.See previous reference and –ë–æ—Ç—Ü –Æ. –í., –ß–µ–∫—É–ª–∞–µ–≤, –í. –ï., –ö–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç–Ω–∞—è —Å–µ—Ç—å. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ \\"–¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç\\" 1976 p. 54 Another type looked like it had all copper wires but inside each wire was a steel core for strength. The steel strands were galvanized but for better corrosion protection they could be coated with an anti-corrosion substance.  Tensioning  Line tensioning in Germany. Catenary wires are kept in mechanical tension because the pantograph causes mechanical oscillations in the wire and the wave must travel faster than the train to avoid producing standing waves that would cause wire breakage. Tensioning the line makes waves travel faster, and also reduces sag from gravity. For medium and high speeds, the wires are generally tensioned by weights or occasionally by hydraulic tensioners. Either method is known as \\"auto-tensioning\\" (AT) or \\"constant tension\\" and ensures that the tension is virtually independent of temperature. Tensions are typically between per wire. Where weights are used, they slide up and down on a rod or tube attached to the mast, to prevent them from swaying. For low speeds and in tunnels where temperatures are constant, fixed termination (FT) equipment may be used, with the wires terminated directly on structures at each end of the overhead line. The tension is generally about . This type of equipment sags on hot days and is taut on cold days. With AT the continuous length of overhead line is limited due to the change in the height of the weights as the overhead line expands and contracts with temperature changes. This movement is proportional to the distance between anchors. Tension length has a maximum. For most 25 kV OHL equipment in the UK, the maximum tension length is . An additional issue with AT equipment is that, if balance weights are attached to both ends, the whole tension length is free to move along the track. To avoid this a midpoint anchor (MPA), close to the centre of the tension length, restricts movement of the messenger/catenary wire by anchoring it; the contact wire and its suspension hangers can move only within the constraints of the MPA. MPAs are sometimes fixed to low bridges, or otherwise anchored to vertical catenary poles or portal catenary supports. A tension length can be seen as a fixed centre point, with the two half-tension lengths expanding and contracting with temperature. Most systems include a brake to stop the wires from unravelling completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large tensioning pulley (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of a stop on the mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a block and tackle arrangement.  Breaks  Lines are divided into sections to limit the scope of an outage and to allow maintenance. = Section break = A section insulator at a section break in Amtrak's 12 kV catenary To allow maintenance to the overhead line without having to turn off the entire system, the line is broken into electrically separated portions known as \\"sections\\". Sections often correspond with tension lengths. The transition from section to section is known as a \\"section break\\" and is set up so that the vehicle's pantograph is in continuous contact with one wire or the other. For bow collectors and pantographs, this is done by having two contact wires run side by side over the length between 2 or 4 wire supports. A new one drops down and the old one rises up, allowing the pantograph to smoothly transfer from one to the other. The two wires do not touch (although the bow collector or pantograph is briefly in contact with both wires). In normal service, the two sections are electrically connected; depending on the system this might be an isolator, fixed contact or a Booster Transformer). The isolator allows the current to the section to be interrupted for maintenance. On overhead wires designed for trolley poles this is done by having a neutral section between the wires, requiring an insulator. The driver of the tram or trolleybus must temporarily reduce the power draw before the trolley pole passes through, to prevent arc damage to the insulator. Pantograph-equipped locomotives must not run through a section break when one side is de-energized. The locomotive would become trapped, but as it passes the section break the pantograph briefly shorts the two catenary lines. If the opposite line is de-energized, this voltage transient may trip supply breakers. If the line is under maintenance, injury may occur as the catenary is suddenly energized. Even if the catenary is properly grounded o protect the personnel, the arc generated across the pantograph can damage the pantograph, the catenary insulator or both. = Neutral section (phase break) = Neutral Section Indication Board used on railways in the UK. Six of these would be required at crossings Sometimes on a larger electrified railway, tramway or trolleybus system it is necessary to power different areas of track from different power grids, without guaranteeing synchronisation of the phases. Long lines may be connected to the country's national grid at various points and different phases. (Sometimes the sections are powered with different voltages or frequencies.) The grids may be synchronised on a normal basis, but events may interrupt synchronisation. This is not a problem for DC systems. AC systems have a particular safety implication in that the railway electrification system would act as a \\"Backdoor\\" connection between different parts, resulting in, amongst other things, a section of the grid de-energised for maintenance being re-energised from the railway substation creating danger. For these reasons Neutral sections are placed in the electrification between the sections fed from different points in a national grid, or different phases, or grids which are not synchronized. It is highly undesirable to connect synchronized grids. A simple section break is insufficient to guard against this as the pantograph briefly connects both sections. In countries such as France, South Africa and the United Kingdom, a pair of permanent magnets beside the rails at either side of the neutral section operate a bogie-mounted transducer on the train which causes a large electrical circuit-breaker to open and close when the locomotive or the pantograph vehicle of a multiple unit passes over them. In the United Kingdom equipment similar to Automatic Warning System (AWS) is used, but with pairs of magnets placed the running rails (as opposed to the AWS magnets placed midway between the rails). Lineside signs on the approach to the neutral section warn the driver to shut off traction power and coast through the dead section. A neutral section or phase break consists of two insulated breaks back-to-back with a short section of line that belongs to neither grid. Some systems increase the level of safety by the midpoint of the neutral section being earthed. The presence of the earthed section in the middle is to ensure that should the transducer controlled apparatus fail, and the driver also fail to shut off power, the energy in the arc struck by the pantograph as it passes to the neutral section is conducted to earth, operating substation circuit breakers, rather than the arc either bridging the insulators into a section made dead for maintenance, a section fed from a different phase, or setting up a Backdoor connection between different parts of the country's national grid. 25 kV AC neutral zone in Romania On the Pennsylvania Railroad, phase breaks were indicated by a position light signal face with all eight radial positions with lenses and no center light. When the phase break was active (the catenary sections out of phase), all lights were lit. The position light signal aspect was originally devised by the Pennsylvania Railroad and was continued by Amtrak and adopted by Metro North. Metal signs were hung from the catenary supports with the letters \\"PB\\" created by a pattern of drilled holes. = Dead section = A special category of phase break was developed in America, primarily by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Since its traction power network was centrally supplied and only segmented by abnormal conditions, normal phase breaks were generally not active. Phase breaks that were always activated were known as \\"Dead Sections\\": they were often used to separate power systems (for example, the Hell's Gate Bridge boundary between Amtrak and Metro North's electrifications) that would never be in-phase. Since a dead section is always dead, no special signal aspect was developed to warn drivers of its presence, and a metal sign with \\"DS\\" in drilled-hole letters was hung from the catenary supports. = Gaps = A swing bridge near Meppel, the Netherlands. There is no overhead line on the bridge; the train coasts through with raised pantograph. Occasionally gaps may be present in the overhead lines, when switching from one voltage to another or to provide clearance for ships at moveable bridges, as a cheaper alternative for moveable overhead power rails. Electric trains coast across the gaps. To prevent arcing, power must be switched off before reaching the gap and usually the pantograph would be lowered.  Overhead conductor rails  B&O;'s overhead third-rail system at Guilford Avenue in Baltimore, 1901, part of the Baltimore Belt Line. The central position of the overhead conductors was dictated by the many tunnels on the line: the ‚à©-shaped rails were located at the highest point in the roof to give the most clearance. Given limited clearance such as in tunnels, the overhead wire may be replaced by a rigid overhead rail. An early example was in the tunnels of the Baltimore Belt Line, where a ‚àè section bar (fabricated from three strips of iron and mounted on wood) was used, with the brass contact running inside the groove. When the overhead line was raised in the Simplon Tunnel to accommodate taller rolling stock, a rail was used. A rigid overhead rail may also be used in places where tensioning the wires is impractical, for example on moveable bridges. Operation of the overhead conductor rails at Shaw's Cove Railroad Bridge in Connecticut In a movable bridge that uses a rigid overhead rail, there is a need to transition from the catenary wire system into an overhead conductor rail at the bridge portal (the last post before the movable bridge). For example, the power supply can be done through a catenary wire system near a swing bridge. The catenary wire typically comprises messenger wire (also called catenary wire) and a contact wire where it meets the pantograph. The messenger wire is terminated at the portal, while the contact wire runs into the overhead conductor rail profile at the transition end section before it is terminated at the portal. There is a gap between the overhead conductor rail at the transition end section and the overhead conductor rail that runs across the entire span of the swing bridge. The gap is required for the swing bridge to be opened and closed. To connect the conductor rails together when the bridge is closed, there is another conductor rail section called \\"rotary overlap\\" that is equipped with a motor. When the bridge is fully closed, the motor of the rotary overlap is operated to turn it from a tilted position into the horizontal position, connecting the conductor rails at the transition end section and the bridge together to supply power. Short overhead conductor rails are installed at tram stops as for the Combino Supra.Siemens press release  Crossings  Tram overhead wire (diagonal) crossing trolleybus wires (horizontal), photographed in Bahnhofplatz, Bern, Switzerland thumbrightAnnotated version of the at left photo, highlighting components Trams draw their power from a single overhead wire at about 500 to 750 V. Trolleybuses draw from two overhead wires at a similar voltage, and at least one of the trolleybus wires must be insulated from tram wires. This is usually done by the trolleybus wires running continuously through the crossing, with the tram conductors a few centimetres lower. Close to the junction on each side, the tram wire turns into a solid bar running parallel to the trolleybus wires for about half a metre. Another bar similarly angled at its ends is hung between the trolleybus wires, electrically connected above to the tram wire. The tram's pantograph bridges the gap between the different conductors, providing it with a continuous pickup. Where the tram wire crosses, the trolleybus wires are protected by an inverted trough of insulating material extending below. Until 1946, a level crossing in Stockholm, Sweden connected the railway south of Stockholm Central Station and a tramway. The tramway operated on 600-700 V DC and the railway on 15 kV AC. In the Swiss village of Oberentfelden, the WSB tramway operating at 750 V DC crosses the SBB line at 15 kV AC; there used to be a similar crossing between the WSB and the SBB at Suhr, this has been replaced by an underpass in 2010. Some crossings between tramway/light rail and railways are extant in Germany. In Z√ºrich, Switzerland, VBZ trolleybus line 32 has a level crossing with the 1,200 V DC Uetliberg railway line; at many places, trolleybus lines cross the tramway. In some cities, trolleybuses and trams shared a positive (feed) wire. In such cases, a normal trolleybus frog can be used. Alternatively, section breaks can be sited at the crossing point, so that the crossing is electrically dead. = Australia = Many cities had trams and trolleybuses using trolley poles. They used insulated crossovers, which required tram drivers to put the controller into neutral and coast through. Trolleybus drivers had to either lift off the accelerator or switch to auxiliary power. In Melbourne, Victoria, tram drivers put the controller into neutral and coast through section insulators, indicated by insulator markings between the rails. Melbourne has three level crossings between electrified suburban railways and tram lines. They have mechanical switching arrangements (changeover switch) to switch the 1,500 V DC overhead of the railway and the 650 V DC of the trams, called a Tram Square.TMSV: Tramway level crossings in Victoria Proposals have been advanced to grade separate these crossings or divert the tram routes. = Greece = Athens has two crossings of tram and trolleybus wires, at Vas. Amalias Avenue and Vas. Olgas Avenue, and at Ardittou Street and Athanasiou Diakou Street. They use the above-mentioned solution. = Italy = In Rome, at the crossing between viale Regina Margherita and via Nomentana, tram and trolleybus lines cross: tram on viale Regina Margherita and trolleybus on via Nomentana. The crossing is orthogonal, therefore the typical arrangement was not available. In Milan, most tram lines cross its circular trolleybus line once or twice. Trolleybus and tram wires run parallel in streets such as viale Stelvio, viale Umbria and viale Tibaldi.  Multiple overhead lines  overhead conductor rails for the same track. Left, 1,200 V DC for the Uetliberg railway (the pantograph is mounted asymmetrically to collect current from this rail); right, 15 kV AC for the Sihltal railway Some railways used two or three overhead lines, usually to carry three-phase current. This is used only on the Gornergrat Railway and Jungfrau Railway in Switzerland, the Petit train de la Rhune in France, and the Corcovado Rack Railway in Brazil. Until 1976, it was widely used in Italy. On these railways, the two conductors are used for two different phases of the three-phase AC, while the rail was used for the third phase. The neutral was not used. Some three-phase AC railways used three overhead wires. These were an experimental railway line of Siemens in Berlin-Lichtenberg in 1898 (length 1.8 kilometres), the military railway between Marienfelde and Zossen between 1901 and 1904 (length 23.4 kilometres) and an 800-metre-long section of a coal railway near Cologne between 1940 and 1949. On DC systems, bipolar overhead lines were sometimes used to avoid galvanic corrosion of metallic parts near the railway, such as on the Chemin de fer de la Mure. All systems with multiple overhead lines have high risk of short circuits at switches and therefore tend to be impractical in use, especially when high voltages are used or when trains run through the points at high speed. The Sihltal Z√ºrich Uetliberg Bahn has two lines with different electrification. To be able to use different electric systems on shared tracks, the Sihltal line has its overhead wire right above the train, whilst the Uetliberg line has its overhead wire off to one side. Overhead catenary Catenary (upper photo) is suited to higher-speed rail vehicles. Trolley wire (lower photo) is suited to slower-speed trams (streetcars) and light rail vehicles. RER Line C trenches and tunnels in central Paris JR West An older rail bridge in Berwick-upon-Tweed, retrofitted to include overhead catenary lines A catenary is a system of overhead wires used to supply electricity to a locomotive, tram (streetcar), or light rail vehicle that is equipped with a pantograph. Gantry with old and new suspended equipment at Grivita railway station, Bucharest. Unlike simple overhead wires, in which the uninsulated wire is attached by clamps to closely spaced crosswires supported by poles, catenary systems use at least two wires. The catenary or messenger wire is hung at a specific tension between line structures, and a second wire is held in tension by the messenger wire, attached to it at frequent intervals by clamps and connecting wires known as droppers. The second wire is straight and level, parallel to the rail track, suspended over it as the roadway of a suspension bridge is over water. Catenary systems are suited to high-speed operations whereas simple wire systems, which are less expensive to build and maintain, are common on light rail or tram (streetcar) lines, especially on city streets. Such vehicles can be fitted with either a pantograph or trolley pole. The Northeast Corridor in the United States has catenary over the between Boston, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. for Amtrak's inter-city trains. Commuter rail agencies including MARC, SEPTA, NJ Transit, and Metro-North Railroad utilize the catenary to provide local service. In Cleveland, Ohio the interurban/light rail lines and the heavy rail line use the same overhead wires, due to a city ordinance intended to limit air pollution from the large number of steam trains that passed through Cleveland between the east coast and Chicago. Trains switched from steam to electric locomotives at the Collinwood rail yards about east of Downtown and at Linndale on the west side. When Cleveland constructed its rapid transit (heavy rail) line between the airport, downtown, and beyond, it employed a similar catenary, using electrification equipment left over after railroads switched from steam to diesel. Light and heavy rail share trackage for about along the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport Red (heavy rail) line, Blue and Green interurban/light rail lines between Cleveland Union Terminal and just past East 55th Street station, where the lines separate. Part of the Boston, Massachusetts Blue Line through the northeast suburbs uses overhead lines, as does the Green Line. = Height = The height of overhead line can create hazards at level crossings, where it may be struck by road vehicles. Warning signs are placed on the approaches, advising drivers of the maximum safe height. The wiring in most countries is too low to allow double stack container trains. The Channel Tunnel has an extended height overhead line to accommodate double-height car and truck transporters. China and India operate lines electrified with extra height wiring and pantographs to allow for double stack container trains. Problems with overhead equipment Overhead lines may be adversely affected by strong winds causing wires to swing. Power storms can knock the power out with lightning strikes on systems with overhead wires, stopping trains following a power surge. During cold or frosty weather, ice may coat overhead lines. This can result in poor electrical contact between the collector and the overhead line, resulting in electrical arcing and power surges. The installation of overhead lines may require reconstruction of bridges to provide safe electrical clearance. Overhead lines, like most electrified systems, require a greater capital expenditure when building the system than an equivalent non- electric system. While a conventional rail line requires only the grade, ballast, ties and rails, an overhead system also requires a complex system of support structures, lines, insulators, power-control systems and power lines, all of which require maintenance. This makes non-electrical systems more attractive in the short term, although electrical systems can pay for themselves eventually. Also, the added construction and maintenance cost-per- mile makes overhead systems less attractive on long-distance railways, such as those found in North America, where the distances between cities are typically far greater than in Europe. Such long lines require enormous investment in overhead line equipment, and major difficulties confront energizing long portions of overhead wire on a permanent basis, especially in areas where energy demand already outstrips supply. Many people consider overhead lines to be \\"visual pollution\\", due to the many support structures and complicated system of wires and cables that fill the air. Such considerations have driven the move towards replacing overhead power and communications lines with buried cables where possible. The issue came to a head in the UK with the Great Western main line electrification scheme especially through the Goring Gap. A protest group with their own website has been formed.  History  The first tram with overhead lines was presented by Werner von Siemens at the International Electric Exposition in Paris 1881: the installation was removed after that event. In October 1883, the first permanent tram service with overhead lines was on the M√∂dling and Hinterbr√ºhl Tram in Austria. The trams had bipolar overhead lines, consisting of two U-pipes, in which the pantographs hung and ran like shuttles. In April to June 1882, Siemens had tested a similar system on his Electromote, an early precursor of the trolleybus. Much simpler and more functional was an overhead wire in combination with a pantograph borne by the vehicle and pressed at the line from below. This system, for rail traffic with a unipolar line, was invented by Frank J. Sprague in 1888. From 1889 it was used at the Richmond Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia, pioneering electric traction.

The area is a popular cosmopolitan residential location and leisure destination, with a number of bars and restaurants. The area also has a number of boutiques and other independent retailers. It is located within the Moseley and Kings Heath Ward of the city, in the constituency of Hall Green. Historically it lay within Worcestershire.https://wikishire.co.uk/map/#Moseley@52.448,-1.875/centre=52.448,-1.875/zoom=14 History Moseley was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Museleie. St. Mary's Church, Moseley was licensed by the Bishop of Worcester (authorised by Pope Innocent VII) in February 1405, and the 600th anniversary was celebrated in 2005 with a series of special events. In 2012 the church bells which had been named as the worst sounding in the country were replaced. Moseley itself developed around a Victorian shopping area known as Moseley Village. Moseley Hall was rebuilt in parkland in the late 1700s and rebuilt by 1795 after being set on fire during rioting in 1791. It was donated in 1891 to the City of Birmingham by Richard Cadbury and now forms part of Moseley Hall Hospital. Spring Hill College (Moseley School), a Gothic revival construction built in 1857, is located in the south of the district. Former pupils include comedian Jasper Carrott and musician Bev Bevan of the Electric Light Orchestra. St. Anne's Church, Moseley was opened in 1874. Moseley was served by Moseley railway station from 1867 to 1941. It was opened by the Midland Railway on the Camp Hill line. A previously named Moseley Station on the same line changed its name to Kings Heath Station upon the opening of the station. Moseley and the surrounding areas were much developed after 1910, being built upon the once extensive farm land that was predominant in this area. The new properties being mostly of large houses, designed to cater for the Edwardian middle-class families that settled in the suburbs surrounding Birmingham's industrial centre. These large houses relied upon at least one servant or \\"tweeny\\" as they were often termed, to help the lady of the house run the household. With the advent of the First World War, staff were hard to find to maintain houses of this size. The heating bills and high maintenance made them unpopular after the war and many were split into flats to cater for the requirements of the expanding working population who moved from the city centre as extensive redevelopment took place in the 1960s. In some respects Moseley and the surrounding area suffered a serious decline in the last part of the 20th century. Much property fell into neglect, and problems with crime, drugs and prostitution became commonplace in the areas bordering Balsall Heath. During this same period, however, with a great deal of cheap accommodation on offer, it is arguable that Moseley also enjoyed its most creative and cosmopolitan phase as the focus of artistic and student communities. In 1970s, the small triangular shaped green in the heart of Moseley village, which was then home to the underground public toilets, was a convenient meeting place for local youth, and was known as \\"Bog Island\\". Today Moseley is one of the more affluent suburbs in Birmingham, although parts of north Moseley continue to suffer deprivation. The area has a mixture of residential properties, with some streets being among the most expensive in the city and others consisting largely of social housing and other rented accommodation. Local band Ocean Colour Scene flourished in the mid-1990s British Britpop‚Äìindie scene with songs such as \\"The Riverboat Song\\", inspired by locations within the suburb of Moseley. Their most successful album (in terms of weeks on chart) was Moseley Shoals.Ocean Colour Scene full Official Chart History, Official Charts Company, retrieved 8 July 2016 Moseley is also the birthplace of Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran. The suburb is the spiritual home of the great Moseley Rugby Football Club, regular cup finalists in the 1970s and 80s, and still regularly hosting one of the top 14 games in the country. Their new home is a few yards from the Moseley border at Billesley. The politician Joseph Chamberlain had his Birmingham residence at Highbury, on the edge of Moseley. The property was entrusted to the city after Chamberlain's death and is currently used as a conference venue and location for civil ceremonies. Literature J. R. R. Tolkien spent his early years in Moseley, living close to Sarehole Mill in Hall Green before moving to the site now occupied by Shades Music off the Alcester Road. Sarehole Mill is believed to have been his inspiration for the tranquil Shire in The Lord of the Rings. He also drew inspiration from Moseley Bog for the landscape of Middle-earth. Planning permission has been acquired for the erection on Moseley Green of a high statue of Treebeard, an Ent from The Lord of the Rings, made by Tolkien's great-nephew, Tim Tolkien. Local author, Jonathan Coe has drawn on Moseley for inspiration, including the suburb in scenes in his books The Rotters' Club and The Closed Circle. Sport Moseley has a rich history of success in Rugby Union. Its most famous team is Moseley Rugby Football Club, who were one of Europe's best teams in the late 1960s to the 1980s. Notable players include Sam Doble, J. F. Byrne, Peter Cranmer, Alain Rolland, Mike Teague and Victor Ubogu. The Moseley Wanderers team of 1900 won the Silver Medal in the Rugby Union competition at the 1900 Olympics. Present Today, a monthly Farmers' Market in Moseley - set up by the Moseley Neighbourhood Forum- has won various awards including best FARMA Certified Urban Farmers' Market 2009 and in 2009 local farmer Dominic Butler won the Most Unique Produce award with his micro blue beetroots. Similarly, Moseley has a well defined and established community spirit and ethos, exemplified by Moseley Neighbourhood Forum - a neighbourhood forum - that works to develop the area for the betterment of everyone. The Moseley Society exists to protect the heritage of the area; meetings of the Society discuss and debate a wide range of local issues and the interests of its residents. The Moseley Community Development Trust (CDT) invests in the social and physical capital of the area. Established with funding from charitable trust funds and with the support of the Moseley and Kings Heath Ward Committee, the CDT is now managing a series of initiatives to improve the environment of Moseley. It has its own monthly magazine, Moseley B13 (formerly Birmingham 13), reporting on local events and personalities. It has been printing since May 1973. A group of volunteers have formed Moseley in Bloom (MiB). Much like the Moseley Community Development Trust, the group undertake many projects which look at the greener issues around Moseley. Many projects take place throughout the year to enhance the landscape of Moseley as well as renovate dilapidated areas. Every summer Moseley hosts Moseley Festival, a festival of arts and culture that sees people in the community come together and hold a series of music, art, food, cultural and sporting events. Moseley Folk Festival happens later in the year, and attracts big names from the world of folk. Mostly Jazz, Funk & Soul Festival takes place in the park during the summer as well. Moseley also has its own literary festival, Pow-Wow LitFest, which has taken place annually at the Prince of Wales pub since 2011. Moseley is also home to many pubs, restaurants and caf√©s. In 2015 Moseley was named as the \\"best urban place to live\\" by The Sunday Times, with the newspaper citing its 'Arts and Crafts', 'Bohemian culture' and 'Victorian Architecture' as reasons to live in the suburb. This award followed its being highlighted by The Guardian in 2013 as a place to move, with similar reasons being cited. The Guardian also pointed out that if HS2 is built it would be the ideal place for a wealthy London worker to live. Education Moseley has two secondary schools, Moseley School, a language college and Queensbridge School, an Arts College. It also has several Primary schools such as Moseley C of E Primary School a one form entry school that has connections with St. Mary's Church and Park Hill Primary School on Alcester Road and St Martin de Porres Catholic Primary School. Moseley is also home to Uffculme School, an all age special school for children on the Autistic Spectrum.

The practice possibly originated among upper class court dancers during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in 10th-century China, then gradually became popular among the elite during the Song dynasty. Foot binding eventually spread to most social classes by the Qing dynasty and the practice finally came to an end in the early 20th century. Bound feet were at one time considered a status symbol as well as a mark of beauty. Yet foot binding was a painful practice and significantly limited the mobility of women, resulting in lifelong disabilities for most of its subjects. Feet altered by binding were called lotus feet. Foot binding was practiced in different forms, and the more severe form of binding may have been developed in the 16th century. It has been estimated that by the 19th century, 40‚Äì50% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, and up to almost 100% among upper-class Chinese women. The prevalence and practice of foot binding however varied in different parts of the country. There had been attempts to end the practice during the Qing dynasty; Manchu Kangxi Emperor tried to ban foot binding in 1664 but failed. In the later part of the 19th century, Chinese reformers challenged the practice but it was not until the early 20th century that foot binding began to die out as a result of anti- foot-binding campaigns. By 2007, there were only a few surviving elderly Chinese women known to have bound feet.  History  = Origin = 18th- century illustration showing Yao Niang binding her own feet There are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these involves the story of Pan Yunu, a favourite consort of the Southern Qi emperor Xiao Baojuan who had delicate feet and danced barefoot on a floor decorated with golden lotus flower design. The emperor expressed admiration and said that \\"lotus springs from her every step!\\" (Ê≠•Ê≠•ÁîüËìÆ), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati under whose feet lotus springs forth. This story may have given rise to the terms \\"golden lotus\\" or \\"lotus feet\\" used to describe bound feet; there is, however, no evidence that Consort Pan ever bound her feet. The general view is that the practice is likely to have originated in the time of the 10th-century Emperor Li Yu of the Southern Tang, just before the Song dynasty. Li Yu created a six- foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine Yao Niang (Á™ÖÂ®ò) to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and perform a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus. Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her. The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread. Some of the earliest possible references to foot binding appear around 1100, when a couple of poems seemed to allude to the practice.Xu Ji ÂæêÁ©ç „ÄäË©†Ëî°ÂÆ∂Â©¶„ÄãÔºö „Äå‰ΩÜÁü•ÂãíÂõõÊîØÔºå‰∏çÁü•Ë£π‰∏§Ë∂≥„ÄÇ„Äç(translation: \\"knowing about arranging the four limbs, but not about binding her two feet); Su Shi ËòáËªæ „ÄäËè©Ëñ©Ë†ª„ÄãÔºö„ÄåÂ°óÈ¶ôËé´ÊÉúËìÆÊâøÊ≠•ÔºåÈï∑ÊÑÅÁæÖË•™ÂáåÊ≥¢ÂéªÔºõÂè™Ë¶ãËàûÂõûÈ¢®ÔºåÈÉΩÁÑ°Ë°åËôïË∏™„ÄÇÂÅ∑Á©øÂÆÆÊ®£Á©©Ôºå‰∏¶Á´ãÈõôË∂∫Âõ∞ÔºåÁ∫ñÂ¶ôË™™ÊáâÈõ£ÔºåÈ†àÂæûÊéå‰∏äÁúã„ÄÇ„Äç Soon after 1148, in the earliest extant discourse on the practice of foot binding, scholar wrote that a bound foot should be arch shaped and small. He observed that \\"women's footbinding began in recent times; it was not mentioned in any books from previous eras.\\" In the 13th century, scholar wrote the first known criticism of the practice: \\"Little girls not yet four or five years old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [their feet] small. I do not know what use this is.\\" Original text: Â¶á‰∫∫Á∫íËÑö‰∏çÁü•Ëµ∑‰∫é‰ΩïÊó∂ÔºåÂ∞èÂÑøÊú™Âõõ‰∫îÂ≤ÅÔºåÊó†ÁΩ™Êó†ËæúËÄå‰Ωø‰πãÂèóÊó†Èôê‰πãËã¶ÔºåÁ∫íÂæóÂ∞èÊù•‰∏çÁü•‰ΩïÁî®„ÄÇ The earliest archaeological evidence for foot binding dates to the tombs of Huang Sheng, who died in 1243 at the age of 17, and Madame Zhou, who died in 1274. Each had her feet bound with 6-foot-long gauze strips. Zhou's skeleton was well preserved and showed that her feet fit the narrow, pointed slippers that were buried with her. The style of bound feet found in Song dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upward, appears to be different from the norm of later eras, and the excessive smallness of the feet, the \\"three-inch golden lotus\\", may be a later development in the 16th century. =Later eras= Small bound feet were once considered beautiful while large unbound feet were judged crude At the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe whose heel contained a small cup. During the Yuan dynasty, some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called \\"toast to the golden lotus\\" and lasted until the late Qing dynasty. The first European to mention footbinding was the Italian missionary Odoric of Pordenone in the 14th century during the Yuan dynasty. However, no other foreign visitors to Yuan China mentioned the practice, including Ibn Battuta and Marco Polo (who nevertheless noted the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very small steps), perhaps an indication that it was not a widespread or extreme practice at that time. The practice however was encouraged by the Mongol rulers on their Chinese subjects. The practice became increasingly common among the gentry families, later spreading to the general population, as commoners and theatre actors alike adopted footbinding. By the Ming period, the practice was no longer the preserve of the gentry, but it was considered a status symbol. As foot binding restricted female movement, one side effect of its rising popularity was the corresponding decline of the art of dance in China in women, and it became increasingly rare to hear about beauties and courtesans who were also great dancers after the Song era. Louise Weiss collection, Saverne. The ideal length for a bound foot was 3 Chinese inches (), around in Western measurement. The Manchus issued a number of edicts to ban the practice, first in 1636 when the Manchu leader Hong Taiji declared the founding of the new Qing dynasty, then in 1638, and another in 1664 by the Kangxi Emperor. However, few Han Chinese complied with the edicts and Kangxi eventually abandoned the effort in 1668. By the 19th century, it was estimated that 40‚Äì50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%. Bound feet became a mark of beauty and were also a prerequisite for finding a husband. They also became an avenue for poorer women to marry into money in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond- servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would be assumed to never have the need to work. Women, their families and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the \\"Golden Lotus\\", being about three Chinese inches long (around in Western measurement). This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Some women with bound feet might not have been able to walk without the support of their shoes and thus would have been severely limited in their mobility. However, many women with bound feet were still able to walk and work in the fields, albeit with greater limitations than their non-bound counterparts. In the 19th and early 20th century, dancers with bound feet were popular, as were circus performers who stood on prancing or running horses. Women with bound feet in one village in Yunnan Province even formed a regional dance troupe to perform for tourists in the late 20th century, though age has since forced the group to retire. In other areas, women in their 70s and 80s could be found providing limited assistance to the workers in the rice fields well into the 21st century. = Demise = Opposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the rebel leaders of the Taiping Rebellion were of Hakka background whose women did not bind their feet, and foot binding was outlawed. The rebellion however failed, and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice, then played a part in changing elite opinion on footbinding through education, pamphleteering, and lobbying of the Qing court. The earliest-known Western anti-foot binding society, Jie Chan Zu Hui (Êà™Á∫èË∂≥‰ºö), was formed in Xiamen in 1874 by 60-70 women in meeting presided over by a missionary John MacGowan. In 1895, Christian women in Shanghai led by Alicia Little formed the Natural Foot (tianzu, literally Heavenly Foot) Society. It was also championed by the Woman's Christian Temperance Movement founded in 1883 and advocated by missionaries including Timothy Richard, who thought that Christianity could promote equality between the sexes. Reform-minded Chinese intellectuals began to consider footbinding to be an aspect of their culture that needed to be eliminated. In 1883, Kang Youwei founded the Anti-Footbinding Society near Canton to combat the practice, and anti-footbinding societies sprang up across the country, with membership for the movement claimed to reach 300,000. The anti-footbinding movement however stressed pragmatic and patriotic reasons rather than feminist ones, arguing that abolition of footbinding would lead to better health and more efficient labour. Reformers such as Liang Qichao, influenced by Social Darwinism, also argued that it weakened the nation, since enfeebled women supposedly produced weak sons. At the turn of the 20th century, early feminists, such as Qiu Jin, called for the end of foot-binding. Many members of anti-footbinding groups pledged to not bind their daughters' feet nor to allow their sons to marry women with bound feet. In 1902, the Empress Dowager Cixi issued an anti-foot binding edict, but it was soon rescinded.\\"Cixi Outlaws Foot Binding\\", History Channel In 1912, the new Republic of China government banned foot binding (though not actively implemented), and leading intellectuals of the May Fourth Movement saw footbinding as a major symbol of China's backwardness. Local warlords such as Yan Xishan in Shanxi engaged in their own sustained campaign against footbinding with feet inspectors and fines for those who continued with the practice, while regional governments of the later Nanjing regime also enforced the ban. The campaign against footbinding was very successful in some regions; in one province, a 1929 survey showed that whereas only 2.3% of girls born before 1910 had unbound feet, 95% of those born after were not bound. In a region south of Beijing, Dingxian, where over 99% of women were once bound, no new cases were found among those born after 1919. In Taiwan, the practice was also discouraged by the ruling Japanese from the beginning of Japanese rule, and from 1911 to 1915 it was gradually made illegal.Hu, Alex. The Influence of Western Women on the Anti-Footbinding Movement. Historical Reflections, Vol. 8, No. 3, Women in China: Current Directions in Historical Scholarship, Fall 1981, pp. 179-199. \\" Besides improvements in civil engineering, progress was made in social areas as well. The traditional Chinese practice of foot binding was widespread in Taiwan's early years. Traditional Chinese society perceived women with smaller feet as being more beautiful. Women would bind their feet with long bandages to stunt growth. Even housemaids were divided into those with bound feet and those without. The former served the daughters of the house, while the latter were assigned heavier work. This practice was later regarded as barbaric. In the early years of the Japanese colonial period, the Foot-binding Liberation Society was established to promote the idea of natural feet, but its influence was limited. The fact that women suffered higher casualties in the 1906 Meishan quake with 551 men and 700 women dead, and 1,099 men and 1,334 women injured--very different from the situation in Japan --raised public concern. Foot binding was blamed and this gave impetus to the drive to stamp out the practice.\\" The practice however lingered on in some regions in China; in 1928, a census in rural Shanxi found that 18% of women had bound feet, while in some remote rural areas such as Yunnan Province it continued to be practiced until the 1950s.Favazza, Armando R. Bodies under Siege: Self-mutilation, Nonsuicidal Self-injury, and Body Modification in Culture and Psychiatry (2011), p. 118.\\"In China, foot binding slowly slips into history\\". Kit Gillet. Los Angeles Times. April 2012. In most parts of China, however, the practice had virtually disappeared by 1949. The practice was also stigmatized in Communist China, and the last vestiges of footbinding were stamped out, with the last new case of footbinding reported in 1957.\\"Women with Bound Feet in China\\". University of Virginia.Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding. Ko, Alice. University of California Press. 2007. 978-0520253902. \\"The last case of girls binding ever occurred in 1957. By the 21st century, only a few elderly women in China still had bound feet. In 1999, the last shoe factory making lotus shoes, the Zhiqiang Shoe Factory in Harbin, closed. Practice = Variations and prevalence = A comparison between a woman with normal feet (left) and a woman with bound feet in 1902 Foot binding was practiced in various forms and its prevalence varied in different regions. A less severe form in Sichuan, called \\"cucumber foot\\" (huanggua jiao) due to its slender shape, folded the four toes under but did not distort the heel and taper the ankle. Some working women in Jiangsu made a pretense of binding while keeping their feet natural. Not all women were always bound‚Äîsome women once bound remained bound all through their lives, but some were only briefly bound, and some were bound only until their marriage. Footbinding was most common among women whose work involved domestic crafts and those in urban areas; it was also more common in northern China where it was widely practiced by women of all social classes, but less so in parts of southern China such as Guangdong and Guangxi where it was largely a practice of women in the provincial capitals or among the gentry. It is thought that the necessity for women labour in the fields due to a longer crop-growing season in the South and the impracticability of bound feet working in wet rice fields limited the spread of the practice in the countryside of the South. The Manchu \\"flower bowl\\" shoes designed to imitate bound feet, mid 1880s. Manchu women, as well as Mongol and Chinese women in the Eight Banners, did not bind their feet, and the most a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly to give them a slender appearance. The Manchus, wanting to emulate the particular gait that bound feet necessitated, adapted their own form of platform shoes to cause them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These \\"flower bowl\\" (Ëä±ÁõÜÈûã) or \\"horse-hoof\\" shoes (È¶¨ËπÑÈûã) have a platform generally made of wood two to six inches in height and fitted to the middle of the sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many Han Chinese in the Inner City of Beijing also did not bind their feet, and it was reported in the mid-1800s that around 50-60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women. The Hakka people however were unusual among Han Chinese in not practicing foot binding at all.Lawrence Davis, Edward (2005). Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, Routledge, p. 333. Most non-Han Chinese people, such as the Manchus, Mongols and Tibetans, did not bind their feet; however, some non-Han ethnic groups did. Foot binding was practiced by the Hui Muslims in Gansu Province,(Original from Harvard University) the Dungan Muslims, descendants of Hui from northwestern China who fled to central Asia, were also seen practicing foot binding up to 1948. In southern China, in Guangzhou, 19th century Scottish scholar James Legge noted a mosque that had a placard denouncing foot binding, saying Islam did not allow it since it constituted violating the creation of God.(Original from Harvard University) = Process = The process was started before the arch of the foot had a chance to develop fully, usually between the ages of 4 and 9. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet were more likely to be numb, and therefore the pain would not be as extreme. First, each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was intended to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, 3 m long and 5 cm wide (10 ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downward and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke. The broken toes were held tightly against the sole of the foot while the foot was then drawn down straight with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it. An X-ray of two bound feet Schema of an x-ray comparison between an unbound and bound foot The girl's broken feet required a great deal of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off. Immediately after this procedure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The bindings were pulled even tighter each time the girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as often as possible (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two or three times a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight. For most the bound feet eventually became numb. However, once a foot had been crushed and bound, attempting to reverse the process by unbinding was painful, and the shape could not be reversed without a woman undergoing the same pain all over again. = Health issues = The most common problem with bound feet was infection. Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl's toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor, and later the smell may come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds. If the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; however, this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding. At the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable. Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position.Cummings, S. & Stone, K. (1997) \\"Consequences of Foot Binding Among Older Women in Beijing China\\", in: American Journal of Public Health EBSCO Host. Oct 1997 Other issues that might arise from foot binding included paralysis and muscular atrophy.  Views and interpretations  There are many interpretations to the practice of footbinding. The interpretive models used include fashion (the Chinese customs may be compared to examples of Western women's fashion such as corsetry); seclusion (sometimes evaluated as morally superior to the gender mingling in the West); perversion (the practice imposed by men with sexual perversions), inexplicable deformation, child abuse, and extreme cultural traditionalism. In the late 20th century some feminists introduced positive overtones, arguing that it gave women a sense of mastery over their bodies, and pride in their beauty.Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ‚ÄúGender and Sinology: Shifting Western Interpretations of Foot binding, 1300-1890,‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äô Late Imperial China‚Äô‚Äô (1999) 20#2 pp 1-34. =Beauty and erotic appeal= Bound feet were considered beautiful, even erotic. Before footbinding was practiced in China, admiration for small feet already existed as demonstrated by the Tang dynasty tale of Ye Xian written around 850 by Duan Chengshi. This tale of a girl who lost her shoe and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the European story of Cinderella, and is thought to be one of its antecedents. For many, the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman's beauty and made her movement more dainty, and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage. The desirability varies with the size of the feet - the perfect bound feet and the most desirable (called \\"golden lotuses\\") would be around 3 Chinese inches (around 4 inches (10 cm) in Western measurement) or smaller, while those larger may be called \\"silver lotuses\\" (4 Chinese inches) or \\"iron lotuses\\" (5 Chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage). The belief that footbinding made women more desirable to men is widely used as an explanation for the spread and persistence of footbinding. Some also considered bound feet to be intensely erotic, and Qing Dynasty sex manuals listed 48 different ways of playing with women's bound feet. Some men preferred never to see a woman's bound feet, so they were always concealed within tiny \\"lotus shoes\\" and wrappings. According to Robert van Gulik, the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman's body; in erotic art of the Qing period where the genitalia may be shown, the bound feet were never depicted uncovered. Howard Levy however suggests that the barely revealed bound foot may also only function as an initial tease. An erotic effect of the bound feet was the lotus gait, the tiny steps and swaying walk of a woman whose feet had been bound. Women with such deformed feet avoided placing weight on the front of the foot and tended to walk predominantly on their heels. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered to be erotically attractive to some men. Some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive, and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina, and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud considered footbinding to be a \\"perversion that corresponds to foot fetishism\\". =Role of Confucianism= A woman with her feet unwrapped A common argument is that the revival of Confucianism as Neo-Confucianism during the Song dynasty resulted in the decline of the status of women, and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the cult of widow chastity, it also contributed to the development of footbinding. According to Robert van Gulik, the prominent Song Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stressed the inferiority of women as well as the need to keep men and women strictly separate. It was claimed by Lin Yutang among others, probably based on an oral tradition, that Zhu Xi also promoted footbinding in Fujian as a way of encouraging chastity among women, that by restricting their movement it would help keep men and women separate. However, historian Patricia Ebrey suggests that this story might be fictitious. Some Confucian moralists in fact disapproved of the erotic associations of footbinding, and unbound women were also praised. The Neo-Confucian Cheng Yi was said to be against footbinding and his family and descendants did not bind their feet. Modern Confucian scholars such as Tu Weiming also dispute any causal link between neo-Confucianism and footbinding. It has been noted that Confucian doctrine in fact prohibits mutilation of the body as people should not \\"injure even the hair and skin of the body received from mother and father\\". It is however argued that such injunction applies less to women, rather it is meant to emphasize the sacred link between sons and their parents. Furthermore, it is argued that Confucianism institutionalized the family system in which women are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the good of the family, a system that fostered such practice. Historian Dorothy Ko proposed that footbinding may be an expression of the Confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment, and that footbinding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized. Footbinding was often classified in Chinese encyclopedia as clothing or a form of bodily embellishment rather than mutilation; one from 1591 for example placed footbinding in a section on \\"Female Adornments\\" that included hairdos, powders, and ear-piercings. According to Ko, the perception of footbinding as a civilised practice may be evinced from a Ming dynasty account that mentioned a proposal to \\"entice [the barbarians] to civilize their customs\\" by encouraging footbinding among their womenfolk. The practice was also carried out only by women on girls, and it served to emphasize the distinction between male and female, an emphasis that began from an early age. Anthropologist Fred Blake argued that the practice of footbinding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves, and perpetuated by women on their daughters, so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society, and to support and participate in the neo- Confucian way of being civilized. =Feminist perspective= Foot binding is often seen by feminists as an oppressive practice against women who were victims of a sexist culture. It is also widely seen as a form of violence against women. Bound feet rendered women dependent on their families, particularly the men, as they became largely restricted to their homes. Thus, the practice ensured that women were much more reliant on their husbands. The early Chinese feminist Qiu Jin, who underwent the painful process of unbinding her own bound feet, attacked footbinding and other traditional practices. She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient as it would mean women imprisoning themselves indoors. She believed that women should emancipate themselves from oppression, that girls can ensure their independence through education, and that they should develop new mental and physical qualities fitting for the new era. The ending of the practice is seen as a significant event in the process of female emancipation in China. In the late 20th century some feminists introduced positive overtones, arguing that it gave women a sense of mastery over their bodies, and pride in their beauty. Historian Dorothy Ko has argued that these feminists have mistakenly imposed late 20th-century middle-class Western ideals of individualism and agency on a highly traditional culture. For example, they assume that the practice represented a woman's individual freedom to enjoy sexuality, despite lack of evidence.Dorothy Ko, \\"Rethinking sex, female agency, and footbinding\\", Research on Women in Modern Chinese History / Jindai Zhongguo Funu Shi Yanjiu (1999), Vol. 7, pp 75‚Äì105 =Other interpretations= Some scholars such as Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates reject the notion that bound feet in China were considered more beautiful, or that it was a means of male control over women, a sign of class status, or a chance for women to marry well (in general, bound women did not improve their class position by marriage). They argued that foot binding was an instrumental means to reserve women to handwork, and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork and keep them close at hand, with the practice dying out as industrial textile processes were introduced. It has been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion, it persisted because it became an expression of Han identity after the Mongols invaded China in 1279, and later the Manchus' conquest in 1644, as it was then practiced only by Han women. During the Qing dynasty, attempts were made by the Manchus to ban the practice but failed, and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among Han Chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries. In literature, film and television The bound foot has played a prominent part in many media works, both Chinese and non-Chinese, modern and traditional.Mei Ching Liu, \\"Women and the Media in China: An Historical Perspective\\", Journalism Quarterly 62 (1985): 45-52. These depictions are sometimes based on observation or research and sometimes on rumors or supposition. Sometimes, as in the case of Pearl Buck's The Good Earth (1931), the accounts are relatively neutral or empirical, implying a respect for Chinese culture (note however that Buck's previous novel, \\"East Wind: West Wind\\", extensively explores the unbinding of a woman's feet, experienced as frightening and painful yet finally empowering, as part of her transition into a new, more modern and more individualistic persona under her doctor husband's tender tutelage). Sometimes the accounts seem intended to rouse like-minded Chinese and foreign opinion to abolish the custom, and sometimes the accounts imply condescension or contempt for China.Patricia Ebrey, \\"Gender and Sinology: Shifting Western Interpretations of Footbinding, 1300‚Äì1890\\", Late Imperial China 20.2 (1999): 1-34. * Quoted in the Jin Ping Mei, ...\\"displaying her exquisite feet, three inches long and no wider than a thumb, very pointed and with high insteps.\\" * Flowers in the Mirror (1837) by Ju-Chen Li includes chapters set in the \\"Country of Women\\", where men bear children and have bound feet. * The Three-Inch Golden Lotus (1994) by Feng Jicai presents a satirical picture of the movement to abolish the practice, which is seen as part of Chinese culture. * In the film The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958), Ingrid Bergman portrays British missionary to China Gladys Aylward, who is assigned as a foreigner the task by a local Mandarin to unbind the feet of young women, an unpopular order that the civil government had failed to fulfill.

Based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Witi Ihimaera, the film stars Keisha Castle-Hughes as Kahu Paikea Apirana, a twelve-year-old MƒÅori girl whose ambition is to become the chief of the tribe. Her grandfather Koro Apirana believes that this is a role reserved for males only. The film was a coproduction between New Zealand and Germany. It was shot on location in Whangara, the setting of the novel. The world premiere was on 9 September 2002, at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film received critical acclaim upon its release. At age 13, Keisha Castle-Hughes became the youngest nominee for the Academy Award for Best Actress before she was surpassed by Quvenzhan√© Wallis, at age 9, for Beasts of the Southern Wild less than a decade later. The film earned $41.4 million on a NZ$9,235,000 budget. In 2005, the film was named on the BFI List of the 50 Films You Should See By the Age of 14. Plot The film's plot follows the story of Paikea Apirana (\\"Pai\\"). The village leader should be the first-born son, a direct patrilineal descendant of Paikea, the Whale Rider, he who rode on top of a whale (Tohora) from Hawaiki. Pai is originally born a twin, but her twin brother and her mother died during childbirth. Pai is female and so technically cannot inherit the leadership. While her grandfather, Koro, later forms an affectionate bond with his granddaughter, carrying her to school every day on his bicycle, he also condemns her and blames her for conflicts happening within the tribe. After the death of his wife and despite overwhelming pressure from Koro, Pai's father refuses to assume traditional leadership or finish the waka (canoe) that he had started building for the baby son; instead, he moves to Germany to pursue a career as an artist. At one point, Paikea decides to live with her father because her grandfather says he does not want her. However, as they are driving away, she finds that she cannot bear to leave the sea as the whale seems to be calling her back. Pai tells her father to return her home. Koro leads a cultural school for the village's first-born boys, hoping to find a new leader. He teaches the boys to use a taiaha (fighting stick), which is traditionally reserved for males. Pai is interested in the lessons, but is discouraged and scolded by Koro for doing so. Pai feels that she can become the leader (although no woman has ever done so) and is determined to succeed. Her grandmother, Nanny, tells Pai that her second son, Pai's uncle, had won a taiaha tournament in his youth while he was still slim and so Pai secretly learns from him. She also secretly follows Koro's lessons. One of the students, Hemi, is also sympathetic towards her. Koro is enraged when he finds out, particularly when she wins a taiaha fight against Hemi. Koro is devastated when none of the boys succeeds at the traditional task of recovering the rei puta (whale tooth) that he threw into the ocean, the mission that would prove one of them worthy of becoming leader. With the loss of the rei puta, Koro in despair calls out the ancient ones, the whales. In an attempt to help, Pai also calls out to them and they hear her call. One day Pai, her uncle, her uncle's girl friend Shilo, and others take the boat to where Koro flung the rei puta into the sea. Pai confidently declares she'll find it and dives into the water. She finds the rei puta, which means that she is the rightful leader. Nanny does not think Koro is ready to accept this and does not tell him. Pai, in an attempt to bridge the rift that has formed, invites Koro to be her guest of honour at a concert of MƒÅori chants that her school is putting on. Unknown to all, she had won an interschool speech contest with a touching dedication to Koro and the traditions of the village. However, Koro was late, and as he was walking to the school, he notices that numerous southern right whales are beached near Pai's home. The entire village attempts to coax and drag them back into the water, but all efforts prove unsuccessful, and even a tractor does not help. Koro sees that as a sign of his failure and despairs further. He admonishes Pai against touching the largest whale because she has \\"done enough\\" damage with her presumption. Also, the largest whale traditionally belongs to the legendary Paikea. When Koro walks away, Pai climbs onto the back of the largest whale at the location and coaxes it to re-enter the ocean. The whale leads the entire pod back into the sea; Pai submerges completely underwater, and the spectators wonder if she has drowned but are relieved when she comes back above sea level. Nanny shows Koro the whale tooth which Pai had previously recovered. When Pai is found and brought to the hospital, Koro declares her the leader and asks for her forgiveness. The film ends with Pai's father, grandparents, and uncle coming together to celebrate her status as the new leader, as the finished waka is hauled into the sea for its maiden voyage. In voiceover, Pai declares, \\"My name is Paikea Apirana, and I come from a long line of chiefs stretching all the way back to the Whale Rider. I'm not a prophet, but I know that our people will keep going forward, all together, with all of our strength.\\" Cast * Keisha Castle-Hughes as Paikea Apirana * Rawiri Paratene as Koro * Vicky Haughton as Nanny Flowers * Cliff Curtis as Porourangi * Grant Roa as Uncle Rawiri * Mana Taumaunu as Hemi * Rachel House as Shilo * Taungaroa Emile as Willie * Tammy Davis as Dog * Mabel Wharekawa as Maka (as Mabel Wharekawa- Burt) * Rawinia Clarke as Miro * Tahei Simpson as Miss Parata * Roi Taimana as Hemi's Dad (as Roimata Taimana) * Elizabeth Skeen as Rehua * Tyronne White as Jake (as Tyrone White) * Taupua Whakataka-Brightwell as Ropata * Tenia McClutchie-Mita as Wiremu * Peter Patuwai as Bubba * Rutene Spooner as Parekura * Riccardo Davis as Maui * Apiata Whangaparita-Apanui as Henare * John Sumner as Obstetrician * Sam Woods as Young Rawiri * Pura Tangira as Ace * Jane O'Kane as Anne * Aumuri Parata-Haua as Baby Paikea Production The community of Whangara, where the film is set The film had budget of NZ$9,235,000. It received $2.5 million from the New Zealand Film Production Fund. Additional financing came from ApolloMedia, Filmstiftung NRW, the New Zealand Film Commission and NZ On Air. Casting director Diana Rowan visited numerous schools to find an actress to play Pai. 10,000 children were auditioned before narrowing it down to 12. Castle-Hughes impressed Caro in the resulting workshop and was cast as Pai. The film was shot in Whangara on the East Coast of New Zealand's North Island and in Auckland. Producer John Barnett said \\"This novel was set in Whangara and it would almost have been heresy to shoot anywhere else. There are very physical things that are described in the book ‚Äì the sweep of the bay, the island that looks like a whale, the meeting houses, the number of houses that are present and of course, the people whose legend we were telling. [...] If we'd gone somewhere else and tried to manufacture the surroundings and the ambience, then I think it would have been noticeable in the picture.\\" The whale beaching was depicted using full-scale models created by Auckland, New Zealand based Glasshammer visual effects. The -long waka seen at the end of the film was made in two halves in Auckland before being transported to Whangara. The waka was given to the Whangara community after filming concluded.

Politics The Moseley and Kings Heath Ward Committee is part of the official structure of Birmingham City Council and exists to discuss issues which affect life within the ward, mostly (although not exclusively) related to the activity of the council. The Committee comprises the two elected Ward Councillors for the area together with the Member of Parliament for the Hall Green, Moseley and King's Heath, Sparkbrook, and Springfield constituency, Roger Godsiff, of which the ward is part. However, meetings are well attended with all of those in attendance not only debating the issues of concern to them but voting on policy. The Ward Committee works with The Moseley and Kings Heath Ward Advisory Board ‚Äì a grouping of representatives from local groups and organisations ‚Äì as a kind of executive for the full Ward Committee. Moseley and Kings Heath Ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer with the current holder of the title being Muna Masood. Demographics The 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 24,273 people living in the ward. 31.0% (7,520) are of an ethnic minority compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. White Irish are excluded from these figures, however. Transport The Alcester Road (A435) passes through the ward and is major route linking the city centre with Redditch and the M40. The A445 and A4040 (Outer Ring Road) are also major roads in the area. Bus routes serving the area are the Number 1, Number 11, Number 35 and Number 50, operated by National Express West Midlands. The Camp Hill railway line passes through the area however there are no railway stations on it. The area was served by Moseley railway station (opened 1867) and Kings Heath railway station (opened 1840), which were located on the line, however, these were both closed in 1941 along with the other stations on the line. A reopening of the line has been considered by Birmingham City Council. A feasibility study has concluded that there is a strong economic case for reopening stations at Moseley, Kings Heath and in Hazelwell/ Stirchley. There was a recommendation against opening a railway station at Balsall Heath as it is close to the city centre, however, the report only looked at potential journeys from Balsall Heath going to the city centre and did not take into account people who want to travel to Balsall Heath from districts around the city. Places of interest The ward covers two conservation areas; Moseley Village and St Agnes. These two areas include many larger residential properties reflecting the affluence of the areas. Other areas in the ward are disadvantaged though. There are several open spaces within the ward including Cannon Hill Park in Moseley, Kings Heath Park and the private Moseley Park. Within Cannon Hill Park is mac (Midlands Art Centre) which is a non-profits art centre. Other places of interest include Moseley Golf Course and the gardens of Highbury Hall. Kings Heath and Moseley Village serve as shopping centres for the ward. Kings Heath Library serves the area and hosts a monthly local history group.

History  LRP was conceived and primarily developed by Dave Cinege from 1997 until 2002. It began originally as a 'router on a floppy' and evolved into a streamlined general purpose network operating system.http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3223 As LRP is the oldest embedded Linux distribution, it formed (in whole or in part) the basis of many other embedded system distributions and commercial products which followed it. Several parts developed or specifically enhanced for LRP are still found in common usage today such as POSIXness and BusyBox. Pioneering Features * Small base OS footprint * A simplified packaging system * Menu based system and package configuration * Strict separation of volatile, non-volatile, Read Only, and Read/Write areas of the root hierarchy * Unpacked and run from ramdisk or run directly from flash * A system to commit configuration changes to a non-volatile medium (Disk/Flash) Unreleased Work Dave Cinege worked on a version 4.0 rewrite of LRP from late 2000 into January 2001. He then began testing some ideas he had with proof of concept code, which he claimed was a radical departure from the status quo. To his surprise, this new direction seemed ideal, prompting him to abandon all work done on LRP 4.0 and begin from scratch on a new OS named LRP 5.0. LRP 5.0 development was headed towards a complete rewrite and reimplementation of Linux userland with a new standard design outside of the POSIX specification. The stated purpose of this was to provide a modern standard base operating system suitable for any application including embedded systems, appliances, servers, and desktop computers. Cinege however stopped work several months later due to financial reasons. He refused to release any further work, or even the name of this OS, due to animosity towards the computer industry and what he perceived as the plundering of open source authors' work by large corporations. On May 6, 2003 Cinege updated the LRP website to reflect that the project was being abandoned.https://web.archive.org/web/20030624030005/http://www.linuxrouter.org/ LRP 5.0 Proposed Features * A base OS size of 8MB * A new shell and scripting language unrelated to bourne shell * A new packaging scheme that would retrofit other OSes * An application management system * A core process management system References  External links  * Linux Journal Article on Linux Router and its comparison with Cisco Routers Discontinued Linux distributions Floppy-based Linux distributions Free routing software Gateway/routing/firewall distribution Light-weight Linux distributions ","title":"Linux Router Project"},{"id":"176768","text":"The Dornier Do 17, sometimes referred to as the Fliegender Bleistift (\\"flying pencil\\"), is a light bomber of Nazi Germany during World War II. It was produced by Claudius Dornier's company, Dornier Flugzeugwerke. The aircraft was designed as a Schnellbomber (\\"fast bomber\\"), a light bomber which, in theory, would be so fast that it could outrun defending fighter aircraft. The Dornier was designed with two engines mounted on a \\"shoulder wing\\" structure and possessed a twin tail fin configuration. The type was popular among its crews due to its handling, especially at low altitude, which made the Do 17 harder to hit than other German bombers. Designed in the early 1930s, it was one of the three main Luftwaffe bomber types used in the first three years of the war. The Do 17 made its combat debut in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War, operating in the Condor Legion in various roles. Along with the Heinkel He 111 it was the main bomber type of the German air arm in 1939‚Äì1940. The Dornier was used throughout the early war, and saw action in significant numbers in every major campaign theatre as a front line aircraft until the end of 1941, when its effectiveness and usage was curtailed as its bomb load and range were limited. Production of the Dornier ended in mid-1940, in favour of the newer and more powerful Junkers Ju 88. The successor of the Do 17 was the much more powerful Dornier Do 217, which started to appear in strength in 1942. Even so, the Do 17 continued service in the Luftwaffe in various roles until the end of the war, as a glider tug, research and trainer aircraft. A considerable number of surviving examples were sent to other Axis nations as well as countries like Finland. Few Dornier Do 17s survived the war and the last was scrapped in Finland in 1952. On 3 September 2010, the Royal Air Force Museum London announced the discovery of a Henschel-built Dornier Do 17Z buried in the Goodwin Sands off the coast of Kent, England. On 10 June 2013, the salvage team raised the airframe from the seabed. Development In 1932, the Ordnance Department (Heereswaffenamt) issued a specification for the construction of a \\"freight aircraft for German State Railways\\", and a \\"high speed mail plane for Lufthansa\\".Dressel and Griehl 1994, p. 25. The factory at Friedrichshafen began work on the design on 1 August 1932. When the Nazis took power in 1933, Hermann G√∂ring became National Commissar for aviation with former Deutsche Luft Hansa employee Erhard Milch as his deputy, soon forming the Ministry of Aviation. The Ministry of Aviation designated the new aircraft Do 17, and on 17 March 1933, just three months after taking office, Milch gave the go ahead for the building of prototypes. At the end of 1933, the Ministry of Aviation issued an order for a \\"high speed aircraft with double tail,\\" and for a \\"freight aircraft with special equipment,\\" in other words, a bomber. The original design (the Do 17 V1) configuration in 1932 had sported a single vertical stabilizer, and Dornier continued developing that model. The Do 17 was first demonstrated in mock-up form in April 1933. The \\"special equipment\\" was to be fitted later, to disguise its offensive role.Griehl 2005, p. 2. In April 1934, the Dornier works at Manzell began project \\"definition.\\" During this month, the defensive armament was designed and the bomb release mechanism details ironed out. Production of these prototypes began on 20 May 1934 and, on 23 November 1934, the Do 17 V1, with a single fin and powered by two BMW VI 7.3 motors, took off on its first flight. Testing was delayed by a series of accidents, with V1 being damaged in landing accidents in February and April 1935. The twin-tailed V2 (powered by low-compression BMW VI 6.3 engines) first flew on 18 May 1935 and was evaluated together with the V1 by the Ministry of Aviation at Rechlin in June. During the tests, the single fin proved to be only marginally stable, resulting in the V1 being modified with a twin tail. The aircraft was destroyed in a crash after an engine failure on 21 December 1935.Green and Swanborough 1986, pp. 42‚Äì43. The V3, also fitted with a twin tail, was originally planned to be powered by Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engines, but as these were unavailable, it was fitted with BMW VI 7.3 engines like the V1 and flew on 19 September 1935.Green and Swanborough 1986, p. 43. The V1 prototype remained the only built machine with the single stabilizer. It is claimed that, unlike the Heinkel He 111 series, whose military use was planned from the start, the Do 17 V1 was contracted as a fast six-passenger mail plane to compete with the smaller Heinkel He 70 monoplaneNowarra 1990, pp. 4‚Äì5. It has been suggested that it was rejected by Luft Hansa, as the cramped cabin was too uncomfortable for passenger use and the operating costs were too high for a mail plane.Nowarra 1990, p. 4. According to the story, the three prototypes remained unused in the Dornier factory in Lowental for almost six months, until Flight Captain Untucht of Luft Hansa came across them. After receiving permission to fly one of the machines, he proceeded to put it through an almost stunt flying routine. After landing, he said that \\"the machine is as nimble as a fighter, give it more lateral stability and we'll have a high speed bomber!\\" Untucht's comments prompted Dornier to redesign the tail unit and revived interest in the type.Nowarra 1990, p. 5. Dornier was then ordered to produce the V4 prototype. Some sources state this differed from the V3 in that the passenger portholes were removed and the single fin was replaced with two smaller ones.Goss 2005, p. 7.Munson 1983, p. 296. Photographic evidence demonstrates the V3 had twin stabilizers from the start of its construction.Griehl 2005, p. 12. The tests of the \\"twin-tailed\\" V4, V6 and V7 prototypes were positive and more prototypes like the V8 emerged as the forerunner of the long-range reconnaissance version, while the V9 was tested as a high-speed airliner.Dressel and Griehl 1994, p. 26. The V9 machine was still flying in 1944. Design The forward fuselage had a conventional stepped cockpit, with a fully glazed nose. Early variants were labelled the \\"flying pencil\\" owing to its sleek and continuous \\"stick-like\\" lines. As a result of the lessons learned in the Spanish Civil War, the cockpit roof was raised and the lower, or bottom half, of the crew compartment was a typical under-nose gondola or \\"Bodenlafette\\" (abbreviated Bola): this inverted- casemate design ventral defensive armament position was a common feature of most German medium bombers. The Bola was extended back to the leading edge of the wings where the lower-rear gunners position and upper-rear gunner position were level with each other.Goss 2005, p. 12. As with contemporary German bombers, the crew were concentrated in a single compartment. The cockpit layout consisted of the pilot seat and front gunner in the forward part of the cockpit. The pilot sat on the left side, close up to the Plexiglas windshield. One of the gunners sat on the right seat, which was set further back to provide room for the MG 15 machine gun to be traversed in use. The Do 17 usually carried a crew of four: the pilot, a bombardier and two gunners. The bomb-aimer also manned the MG 15 in the nose glazing and Bola-housed rear lower position. The two gunners operated the forward-firing MG 15 installed in the front windshield, the two MGs located in the side windows (one each side) and the rearward firing weapon. The cockpit offered a bright and panoramic view at high altitude.Goss 2005, p. 25. The standard ammunition load was 3,300 rounds of 7.92 mm ammunition in 44 double-drum magazines.Griehl 2005, p. 6. Cockpit of a Do 17 The wings were of a broad area and had a span of with a straight leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with the top of the fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway down the side of the fuselage increasing the angle of incidence.Wrobel 2008, page not numbered after p. 93. Schematic drawing in Appendices: \\"Sheet 1\\". This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217.Griehl 1991, p. 57. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.Goss 2005, p. 20. FuG 10 radio set used in the Do 17Z. The fuselage was long. It was thin and narrow, which presented an enemy with a difficult target to hit. The fuselage had twin vertical stabilizers to increase lateral stability. The power plant of the Z-1 was to have been the Daimler-Benz DB 601 but, owing to shortages from priority allocation for Bf 109E and Bf 110 fighter production, it was allocated Bramo 323 A-1 power plants. The Bramos could only reach at . The limited performance of the Bramo 323s ensured the Do 17 could not reach at in level flight when fully loaded.Griehl 2005, p. 5. The range of the Do 17Z-1 at ground level was ; this increased to 1,370 km (850 nm) at . This gave an average attack range of . The introduction of the Bramo 323P increased the Z-2 performance slightly in all areas. The Dornier had self-sealing fuel tanks to protect fuel stored in the wings and fuselage. This reduced the loss of fuel and risk of fire when hit in action, and often enabled the aircraft to return. Twenty oxygen bottles were provided for crew use during long flights above . Communications usually consisted of FuG X, the later FuG 10 (Funkger√§t), navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilger√§t) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 1 blind-landing devices. The crew communicated by EiV intercom. A primitive autopilot device, the Siemens K4√ú, was installed and could maintain bearing using the rudder's control surfaces. The bomb bay accommodated four bomb racks, the No. 5 for SC50 bombs and two ETC 500 racks to carry heavier loads of up to each. A Lotfe A, or B bombsight was issued together with the BZA-2 aperture (a modernised optical lens system). The aircraft's bomb bay allowed two options. The first was to carry four bombs for a load of , which reduced aircraft range. With half the maximum load, ten bombs, additional fuel tanks could be placed into the forward part of the bomb bay to increase range. The bomb aimer would deploy the bomb load via the Lotfe (A, B or C 7/A, depending on the variant) bomb sight which was in the left side of the nose compartment directly under and forward of the pilot.Keskinen and Stenman 1999, pp. 6‚Äì7. When fully loaded, the Z-1 weighed . Variants =Early Daimler- Benz-powered variants= Dornier Do 17E somewhere in Sicily with DFS 230 gliders, 1943 The initial production variants were the Do 17E-1 bomber, which was tested with two Daimler-Benz DB 600, and Do 17F-1 reconnaissance aircraft, powered like the early prototypes with BMW VI engines, which entered production in late 1936. The first Luftwaffe units converted to the Do 17 in early 1937.Green 1967, pp. 142‚Äì144. The Do 17E-1 was equipped with two BMW VI 7.3D inline engines of 750 PS each. The crew numbered three. The radio operator manned the two 7.92 mm MG 15 machine guns within a B-Stand pod in the rear cockpit. They had 750 rounds of ammunition. The bomb bay was divided into two compartments. Each had five bomb racks with individual capacity of . A single ETC 500/IX bomb rack could be mounted externally underneath the aircraft to carry a 500 kg bomb. A Do 17 E-1 with the designation D-AJUN was tested with an unusual configuration, two SC 500 bombs mounted side by side under the fuselage. It showed a notable performance reduction due to the increase in weight and drag, this configuration was not used operationally. The E-1 continued to carry low bomb loads into the Second World War. The performance of the E-1 enabled it to reach a speed of at . Conducting a shallow dive the light frame of the Do 17 could reach . Its maximum ceiling was . Several E-1s were rebuilt as E-2 or E-3, at least three E-2 and one E-3 were used by DVL and Hansa-Luftbild GmbH (Hansa Aerial Photography Ltd) in a secret military reconnaissance role prior to the war.Griehl 2005, p. 3. The Do 17F-1 was a long-range reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 was used to test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand ‚Äî lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft. Conversion of two E-2 series aircraft with two BMW 132F radial engines led to the Do 17 J-1 and J-2. These aircraft served as flight testing machines to evaluate the BMW 132 for usage in the Do 17. The aircraft were the V18 (Wrk Nr, or Werknummer meaning works/factory number, 2021) and V19 (Wrk Nr 2022) prototypes. Trials began in late 1937. A similar conversion, but with Bramo 323 radial engines, led to the designation Do 17 L-1 and L-2. Two Do 17 (Wrk Nr 2031 and 2032) were renamed as V20 and V21 prototypes and used to evaluate the Bramo 323 for usage in the Do 17. The test were satisfactory and all future production models would be equipped with this engine. After seeing the Do 17M V1 at the Z√ºrich air races in 1937, the Yugoslav Royal Air Force bought license rights for production at the Drzavna Fabrika Aviona factory in 1938. They equipped it with the more powerful Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N radial engine (although the French exaggerated its performance) Dornier designs were delivered to the Pomorsko Vazduhoplovstvo (Naval Aviation - PV) in 1926, namely the Dornier Komet and Dornier Do Y heavy bombers. The Yugoslavs were familiar with Dornier designs, and on 19 November 1935 Yugoslav pilots test-flew the Do 17 V-3 prototype, D-ABIH, W.Nr. 258. They decided to select the Do 17 for service, despite it being more expensive than any other aircraft, because of the German willingness to deliver them quickly without limitations on numbers.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 5. The Do 17L-0 and Do 17M-0 were developed in parallel as replacements for the earlier E and Fs, the L being the reconnaissance version. Both were designed around the more powerful DB 600A engines, delivering about . Two L and one M versions were built as prototypes, both with another MG 15 in the nose.Nowarra 1990, p. 14. The first prototype of the revised version, the Do 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a maximum speed of .Green and Swanborough 1986, p. 46. At the International Military Aircraft Competition at Z√ºrich, Switzerland in 1937, the Dornier Do 17M V1 proved a leader in its class and was faster than the fastest foreign fighter, the French Dewoitine D.510. The Do 17, along with the Messerschmitt Bf 109, won many prizes, demonstrating the prowess of German aviation design.Smith 1967, p. 4. =Radial variants= Despite its success, owing to shortages in the supply of the Daimler-Benz engine, the production Do 17M was fitted with the Bramo 323 engine,Green 1967, p. 146. with the corresponding reconnaissance aircraft, the Do 17P, being powered by BMW 132Ns to give better range.Green 1967, p. 148. The supply of the DB 600 remained extremely limited as production was soon switched over to the fuel-injected DB 601, which was reserved for the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters. Therefore, production versions of the basic Do 17M model airframe were fitted with the new Bramo 323A-1 Fafnir engines of , which gave reasonable performance and raised the bomb load to . The resulting Do 17 M-1 was produced in small numbers and operated until 1941.Goss 2005, pp. 9‚Äì10. The prototypes for the M-1 series were Do 17M V1 (Werk Nr 691) and Do 17M V2 (Werk Nr 692) which were tested with bomb loads of a medium bomber. The third prototype, Do 17M V3 was evaluated as a fast bomber. The M V1 was fitted with two Daimler Benz DB 601 inline engines while the M V2 and M V3 had the Bramo 323 A and D respectively. The Ministry of Aviation favoured the widespread use of the DB 601, but demand for the DB 601s in fighter aircraft and the lack of production forced the use of the Bramo.Griehl 2005, p. 4. The Do 17 M-1 started its service as a medium bomber and was able to carry of bombs. It was equipped with two air-cooled Bramo 323 A-1 or A-2. The defensive armament consisted of two, and later three, MG 15 machine guns. The first was operated in an A-Stand pod operated by the navigator through the windshield. The position was allocated 370 rounds of ammunition. The rearward firing B-Stand was operated by the radio operator and allocated 750 rounds. The rear position in the lower fuselage was allocated 375 rounds in a C-Stand pod. The Do 17M could carry a bomb load of either 20 SC50 or two SC250 bombs or 10 SC50 and a single SC250 bomb. The speed of the M was superior to that of the E variant. The Do 17M could reach at altitudes of and could achieve a maximum service ceiling of and a range of . Do 17Z in the Soviet Union, winter 1941-42 showing its sleek, pencil-like, outline. Reconnaissance aircraft based on the M-1, the under- surfaces of the wing were covered with duralumin and it had a wider engine axis and longer engine nacelles. The demand for a reconnaissance aircraft based on the M-1 led to the development of the P-1 variant.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 10. The L version would not be able to enter production with the DB 600 owing to its use in the Bf 109, and the Bramo engine was rather thirsty on fuel and left the M models with too short a range for reconnaissance use. BMW 132N radials of 865 PS were selected instead, which had lower fuel consumption for better range. Another two prototypes with DB 600 engines were produced as the Do 17R-0, but did not enter production. During reconnaissance missions the P-1 was armed with four MG 15s in the A, B and C‚ÄîStands. One machine gun was located in the rear of the cockpit, another in the lower rear Bola mount, one facing forward through the windscreen and the other in the nose glazing.Griehl 2005, p. 30. In earlier variants the B-Stand (the gun position in the upper rear cockpit) was open to the elements, but the P-1 now provided an enclosed bulb-shaped mount protecting the radio operator from the weather.Griehl 2005, p. 22. The P variant had similar features to the Do 17M-1, with added blind flying and camera equipment for reconnaissance work. The Do 17P-1 was powered by two BMW 132N radial engines with a maximum performance of 865 PS ( each. The machine was fitted with several radio variations. The FuG IIIaU radio (Funkger√§t), the PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilger√§t) and the FuBI 1 radio blind-landing device (FuBI - Funkblindlandeger√§t). The crew of three communicated with each other via the EiV intercom (EiV -Eigenverst√§ndigungsanlage). The P-1 was equipped with either Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 and Rb 50/18 cameras. The P-1/trop was fitted with filters and protection for the cameras.Smith 1967, p. 5. The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit. Two Do 17Zs in a maintenance hangar. The detached Bramo 323s power plants can be seen. Due to a shortage of night fighters, at least one Do 17P-1 was assigned to this role. A smooth metal sheet was installed in place of its glass nose and it was armed with three MG 151/20 cannons. The machine operated under Luftflotte 1. The Do 17P-2 was identical to the P-1, with the additional installation of an ETC 500 bomb rack under the fuselage. These aircraft were designed for night reconnaissance. It is assumed that Dornier converted most, if not all, P-2 models from existing P-1 production aircraft. Unlike the P-2, the Do 17R-1 did not see series production. The experiences of the Spanish Civil War proved that unarmed aircraft were easy prey for fighter aircraft. The R-1 was to be a fast long- range reconnaissance aircraft with two additional fuel cells inside the fuselage aft of the bomb bay. Two variants were suggested, the first (variant I) had a single Rb 50/30 and two Rb 20/30 cameras, while variant II had a third fuel cell to replace the rear Rb 20/30. The aircraft had a gross weight of but could be overloaded to in emergencies. The crew usually numbered three, but a fourth was added depending on the missions to be flown. To achieve a high performance at increased altitudes two DB 600 Gs were to be used. The power plants were tested in the Do 17R V1 prototype registered D-ABEE. The second, the R V2, registered D-ATJU, received the even more powerful DB 601 Aa engines. The power plant of the R-1s that did exist are not known. The lessons from the Spanish Civil War had led Dornier's designers to incorporate more defensive machine guns. Battles with Soviet-built fighter aircraft had demonstrated that the Dornier was not as fast and invulnerable as was first thought. To cope with this, a completely new pod-like cockpit was designed to give the crew more room and better visibility. The roof was extended upward over the line of the fuselage, sloping down to meet it just in front of the wing. The dorsal gun was moved to the rear of the pod where it had a considerably better field of fire. Likewise, the floor was dropped under the fuselage as a Bola casemate-style defensive armament emplacement, and the ventral gun moved to the back of the Bola, allowing it to fire directly to the rear. The changes in the roof and floor made the whole front of the aircraft much larger. The rest of the airframe remained the same. The new cockpit design was nicknamed Kampfkopf (German: \\"battle head\\"). Three S variant prototypes with the DB 600 G inline engines were tested. The S-01 (designation D-AFFY), 03 and 04 were flown. The inverted V-12 engines were constructed as the Do 17 S-0 reconnaissance version, but it did not go into production. An additional 15 Do 17 U-1 pathfinder models were built, similar to the S-0 but adding another crewman (taking the total to five) to operate the extra radio equipment. The U models were to fly ahead of other bombers on night missions, using the radio equipment to locate the target and drop flares on it. They were personally requested by KG 100 as experimental models for this role. The U-1 had a maximum speed of and a combat ceiling of . The U-1 had a cruising speed of and a maximum reachable height of , owing to the \\"rather low performance of the Bramo 323 A-1 engines\\". The three prototypes (U-01 - U-03) and twelve production aircraft were built by 1938. =Dornier Do 17Z: The main variant= Dornier Do 17Z of the Finnish Air Force, January 1942 The Dornier Do 17Z series was the most recognised and mass-produced variant, and saw more combat service than the E-U types. The type was modified as a result of combat experience during the Spanish Civil War. The forward fuselage was redesigned, with the cockpit area being \\"dropped\\", or extended further to enable a rear firing gunner position to be installed, and the canopy extended aft, until it was nearly parallel with the leading edge and wing root. To test the design, the Do 17S and Do 17U were produced, both to be powered by the DB 600 power plants. However, a call for all DB 600 series engines to be reserved for fighters led to the variants being fitted with Bramo Fafnir 323 A radial engines. The bomb load was increased to and a fourth crew member was added. It proved to be underpowered, so Bramo 323 P engines were then fitted. Only three Do 17S and 15 Do 17Us were built. With the updates, the Dornier, with a full bomb load, had a combat radius of . Later variants, in the Do 17 Z-3, Z-4 and Z-5, which were fitted with cameras, dual trainer controls and flotation aids (for maritime operations) respectively, still could not solve the problems with range and bomb load. At first, a batch of Z-0s were built with the Fafnir for testing, the DB 600 again proving to be too hard to obtain. These were quickly replaced with the Z-1 model, which added another gun for the bombardier, but the additional weight of the nose and guns meant the bomb load was reduced to . The Luftwaffe, not being satisfied with the test outcome of the Z series, immediately ordered performance and design studies to increase the overall performance of the bomber. These resulted in very optimistic speeds and altitudes for all future Z variants, especially for the Z-5 aircraft. Planned performance altitudes of up to at a maximum speed of with an aircraft weight of were planned. Unfortunately, production aircraft never reached these optimistic performances during the service career of the Do 17Z. At , the heavy Do 17Z-1 used two Bramo 323 A-1 engines with self-sealing fuel cells in the fuselage and wings. The crew of four consumed approximately 20 bottles of oxygen during long flights above . The Do 17Z-1 had a speed of at . However, the performance of the Bramo 323s did not permit the Do 17 to reach at and level flight when fully loaded. Range of the Z-1 at ground level was while at this increased to . This gave an average range of . The introduction of the Bramo 323P increased subsequent performance in the following sub variants. This was addressed in the major production model, the Do 17 Z-2. The Z-2 mounted the new 323P-1 version of the Fafnir with , which was specifically tuned to the performance needs of the Do 17 by decreasing supercharger power at lower altitudes and thus improving low-level performance. The increase in takeoff power allowed the bomb load to be increased from . However the combat range with a full bomb load was a very short . The armament was further upgraded by adding another pair of guns firing out of the sides of the upper part of the pod, but as the three guns were all fired by a single gunner, only one of them could be fired at a time. From May 1940, 422 Do 17 Z-2s flew with Kampfgeschwader 2, Kampfgeschwader 3, Kampfgeschwader 76 and Kampfgeschwader 77. The upgrades of the Z-2 had its overall weight increased from . After heavy losses of Do 17s during the Battle of Britain it was decided to replace the MG FF cannon with the more powerful MG 151/15. Losses had mounted in spite of an increase of up to eight machine guns in some Dorniers.Griehl 2005, pp. 6‚Äì7. The Z-3 formed part of the bomber versions of the Z series, it was, however, also used as a reconnaissance aircraft by the staff flight of the particular unit. The engines and the general equipment were identical to the Z-2 standard; however two cameras ‚Äî the Rb 50/30 and Rb 20/30 - were incorporated into the crew entry hatch. A handheld camera was issued to the crew to validate the success during bombing missions. Autopilot equipment was added later. The Z-2 and Z-3 were identical visually, and could only be distinguished from each other by the altered crew hatch on the Z-3. Owing to spacing problems because of the added camera equipment, the ammunition supply was reduced from 44 to 42 magazines.Griehl 2005, p. 7. The power plant of the Z-3 was upgraded to the Bramo 323P-2. The Bramo P-2 remained the engine of all the remaining Z series variants. Do 17 dropping bombs The Z-4 was designed as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight. The Z-5 was similar to the Z-3 with a weight of . Designed as an anti-shipping aircraft, the Z-5, was fitted with flotation cells in the fuselage and engine nacelles in case it was forced down on water.Griehl 2005, p. 9. Usually the flotation devices took the form of inflatable bags stored in the rear of the engine nacelles and in bulges on either side of the nose, just behind the front glazing.Goss 2005, p. 14. Later variants of the Z model were developed. The Z-6 was to be a reconnaissance aircraft, although it was only built as a prototype. During the war only a few were converted from existing combat variants. The type was selected for weather check flights. It was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 variants, but offensive armament was omitted and extra fuel cells fitted. This increased the fuel load to 2,890 l (578 imperial gallons). As flights required higher altitude, the oxygen supply was increased from 20 to 24 bottles. For long-range flights over water, the larger dinghy of the Z-5 with its updated emergency escape equipment was mandatory during operations. The Z-6s were also used for night fighter operations. Some of the few converted Z-6s had the Ju 88C-6 nose installed and were equipped with machine guns and cannons. The nose proved to be unsatisfactory, and it was redesigned. In the tip of the new nose was an infrared spotlight which was soon made redundant after the introduction of Lichtenstein radar which was fitted to some of the Z-6. Do 17 Z-2s over France, summer 1940Nowarra 1990, p. 33. The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was intended as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery. An increase in armour would have meant a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire.Griehl 2005, p. 8. The Z-9, which was fitted with special bomb release equipment, and delayed release gear for low-level attack missions. Its purpose was to suppress enemy air defences. Therefore, it was designed to fly over anti-aircraft positions and drop Butterfly Bombs, an early form of cluster bomb munitions. This could only be done with air superiority, as the Z-9 was unarmoured. The airframe and equipment was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 version. Only the bomb bay was altered to accommodate 16 bomb-dispenser systems. The maximum weight of the Z-9 was . The design did not reach serial production. After bomber production ended in 1940, the Z model was modified with a \\"solid\\" nose from the Ju 88C, fitted with one 20 mm MG FF cannon and three 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns, to be used as night fighters. Three prototypes were converted from existing Z-series airframes to the Do 17 Z-7 Kauz I (\\"screech-owl\\") configuration. The standard Z-7 was fitted with Bramo 323P-1 radial engines and had a crew of three airmen. In comparison to the standard bomber version, the fuel load arrangement was altered by subdividing into cells. Two cells were in the wings, with a capacity of 770 litres (154 imperial gallons) each. A third cell was placed in the bomb bay within the main fuselage, having a capacity of 895 litres (179 imperial gallons). The oxygen supply for the three man crew was reduced to nine bottles, as intercepts at high altitudes were not anticipated. Add-on armour in the form of heavy steel plates was bolted to the nose bulkhead to protect the crew against frontal fire. Originally, it was planned to completely armour the crew compartment. This idea, was given up again as the increased weight would have reduced flight performance of an already slow aircraft. The ammunition loads for the three 7.92 mm MG 17s amounted to 3,000 rounds and 400 rounds of ammunition for the 20 mm MG 151 cannon (although some Do 17Z bombers carried a single 20 mm for ground attack missions).Griehl 2005, p. 45. FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C UHF radar Later, the design was further modified to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system.Smith 1967, p. 6. The infrared lamp in the nose was used to illuminate the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the pilot.Griehl 2005, p. 44. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20 mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20 mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system.Goss 2005, p. 15.Nowarra 1990, p. 40. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.Nowarra 1990, p. 41. Only 10 of these Kauz II designs were converted from existing Z-series airframes. The Spanner system proved to be essentially useless and many Z-10 were left without any detection system. At least one Z-10, coded CD+PV, was used as a flying test bed to help developing the early low-UHF band B/C version of the Lichtenstein radar system in late 1941‚Äì1942. When the Z-10 was stripped of all non-night fighter equipment, it had a maximum weight of . Armament fit was similar to that of the Z-7, with an added MG 17 and an additional 1,000 rounds of ammunition in the nose section. Defensive gun positions included the B and C stand, each equipped with a single MG 15. Production =German= The Do 17Z was the most produced variant of the Do 17 series Official figures state 2,139 Do 17s were built on German assembly lines. At the Dornier factory at Oberpfaffenhofen, 328 Do 17Es were built along with a further 77 Do 17Fs and 200 Do 17M variants. Do 17Z production figures for Oberpfaffenhofen stand at 420. At Friedrichshafen, 84 Do 17Ks were built, some of which were sold to the Yugoslav Royal Air Force. Do 17P production was spread out over different factory lines. At Siebel/Halle, eight were built. At the Henschel factory at Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld 73 were constructed. At the HFB plant in Hamburg 149 were built. Henschel also produced some 320 Do 17Zs, HFB contributed to construction of 74 at its Hamburg plant, and another 73 were built at Siebel. Some 105 examples of the Dornier Do 215B was later built at Oberpfaffenhofen. By 19 September 1938, the Luftwaffe had received 579 Dornier Do 17s. These were mostly Do 17E, F, M and P variants.Nowarra 1990, p. 25. During 1939‚Äì1940, some 475 Dornier Do 17Z bombers, 16 reconnaissance aircraft and nine night fighters were built. Another 100 Dornier Do 215s, an updated variant of the Do 17, were built during this period also.Nowarra 1990, p. 48. =Yugoslav= Other governments were interested in the Do 17. In June 1936, the Yugoslav government ordered 36 Do 17E variants from Germany. The negotiations for a licence were completed on 27 June 1938 for 36 Do 17Ka's at the cost of 1,829,825 Reichsmark (RM). On 18 March 1938, Yugoslavia ordered 16 complete Do 17 Ka-2's and Ka-3's at a cost of 3,316,788 RM. They received the last on 21 April 1939. The machines were from 72-96% complete.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 9. The Dorniers were devoid of German equipment, including engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer to supply the powerplants instead. Gnome et Rh√¥ne was the supplier chosen, and the Gnome-Rh√¥ne Mistral Major engine was to be used in the Dornier. The French had inflated the performance data of the engine, claiming it to have and a speed of at . The constant-speed propellers were also poor, and delivered late. This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier propellers.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 6. Only one of the Do 17s delivered was fitted out complete with German equipment. The rest of the Dorniers were equipped with Belgian FN 7.9 mm (.31 in) machine guns, Czech camera equipment and eventually Telefunken radio sets.Ciglic and Savic 2007, pp. 6‚Äì7.

The Dornier Do 17Z-2, Werknummer 1160, built under license by Henschel with the full Geschwaderkennung (combat wing aircraft ID code) of 5K+AR, was operated by 7 Staffel, III Gruppe, Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3). On 26 August 1940, 5K+AR was taking part in a raid by KG 2 and KG 3, targeting the RAF stations RAF Debden and RAF Hornchurch. While flying over clouds, the aircraft became separated from the bomber formation and lost its bearings; it was then attacked by Boulton Paul Defiant fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF. One of the Dornier's engines was disabled and the other damaged, so the wounded pilot, Feldwebel (Flight Sergeant) Willi Effmert, elected to make a crash landing on the Goodwin Sands. He and another crew member survived and were taken prisoner. The other two crew were killed; one is buried at Cannock Chase German war cemetery and the other in the Netherlands.

Many STOL- designed aircraft also feature various arrangements for use on runways with harsh conditions (such as high altitude or ice). STOL aircraft, including those used in scheduled passenger airline operations, have also been operated from STOLport airfields which feature short runways. Design considerations GAF Nomad of the Philippine Air Force Many fixed-wing STOL aircraft are bush planes, though some, like the de Havilland Canada Dash-7, are designed for use on prepared airstrips; likewise, many STOL aircraft are taildraggers, though there are exceptions like the PAC P-750 XSTOL, the Quest Kodiak, the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and the Peterson 260SE. Autogyros also have STOL capability, needing a short ground roll to get airborne, but capable of a near-zero ground roll when landing. Runway length requirement is a function of the square of the minimum flying speed (stall speed), and most design effort is spent on reducing this number. For takeoff, large power/weight ratios and low drag help the plane to accelerate for flight. The landing run is minimized by strong brakes, low landing speed, thrust reversers or spoilers (less common). Overall STOL performance is set by the length of runway needed to land or take off, whichever is longer. Fieseler Storch with German Luftwaffe markings Of equal importance to short ground run is the ability to clear obstacles, such as hills, on both take off and landing. For takeoff, large power/weight ratios and low drag result in a high rate of climb required to clear obstacles. For landing, high drag allows the aeroplane to descend steeply to the runway without building excess speed resulting in a longer ground run. Drag is increased by use of flaps (devices on the wings) and by a forward slip (causing the aeroplane to fly somewhat sideways through the air to increase drag). Normally, a STOL aircraft will have a large wing for its weight. These wings often use aerodynamic devices like flaps, slots, slats, and vortex generators. Typically, designing an aircraft for excellent STOL performance reduces maximum speed, but does not reduce payload lifting ability. The payload is critical, because many small, isolated communities rely on STOL aircraft as their only transportation link to the outside world for passengers or cargo; examples include many communities in the Canadian north and Alaska. Most STOL aircraft can land either on- or off-airport. Typical off-airport landing areas include snow or ice (using skis), fields or gravel riverbanks (often using special fat, low-pressure tundra tires), and water (using floats): these areas are often extremely short and obstructed by tall trees or hills. Wheel skis and amphibious floats combine wheels with skis or floats, allowing the choice of landing on snow/water or a prepared runway. STOL kits Cessna 182K A number of aircraft modification companies offer STOL kits for improving short field performance. *Crosswinds STOL of Wasilla, Alaska sells STOL kits for light aircraft, including leading edge cuffs, tip spill plates, inboard flap extensions and STOL fences. The company offers kits for Piper PA-12, PA-14, PA-18, PA-20 and 22, Bellanca Champion Model 7 series, Cessna 170B, 180 and 185. *Horton, Inc of Wellington, Kansas offers STOL kits under the brand name Horton STOL-Craft, emphasizing that the modifications increase safety by allowing forced landings to occur at lower speeds and thus improve survivability. The Horton modifications include a drooped leading edge cuff, conical cambered wingtips, control surface gap seals and wing fences. The company says: \\"On an average you can expect to get a 4-7 knot reduction in stall speeds. Flying at these lower stall speeds you can reduce the take-off and landing distances by 10%\\". Horton STOL kits are available for several Cessna and Piper PA-28 models. *Micro AeroDynamics markets vortex generator modification kits for \\"STOL benefits\\". The Micro kits are small vortex generators that are glued to the wing leading edge, as well as the underside of the elevator and on the fin. Kits are available for a large number of light aircraft types. *Sierra Industries sells Robertson STOL kits, marketed under the name R/STOL, incorporate a drooped leading edge cuff, wing fences, drooping ailerons and an automatic trim system. The company says that installation \\"allows 15 to 25 MPH slower approaches and requires up to 40% less runway distance\\". R/STOL kits are available for various Cessna models. *Stolairus Aviation of Kelowna, BC has developed STOL Kits for the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver and de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to increase lift and reduce stall speeds.

It was the first flying wing to be powered by jet engines.Green 1970, p. 247. The design was a response to Hermann G√∂ring's call for light bomber designs capable of meeting the \\"3√ó1000\\" requirement; namely to carry of bombs a distance of with a speed of . Only jets could provide the speed, but these were extremely fuel- hungry, so considerable effort had to be made to meet the range requirement. Based on a flying wing, the Ho 229 lacked all extraneous control surfaces to lower drag. It was the only design to come even close to the requirements, and received G√∂ring's approval. Its ceiling was .Boyne 1994, p. 325. Design and development In the early 1930s, the Horten brothers had become interested in the flying wing design as a method of improving the performance of gliders. The German government was funding glider clubs at the time because production of military and even motorized aircraft was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. The flying wing layout removed the need for a tail and associated control surfaces and theoretically offered the lowest possible weight, using wings that were relatively short and sturdy, and without the added drag of the fuselage. The result was the Horten H.IV.Dowling, Stephen. \\"The Flying Wing Decades Ahead of its Time.\\" BBC News, 2 February 2016. In 1943, Reichsmarschall G√∂ring issued a request for design proposals to produce a bomber that was capable of carrying a load over at ; the so-called \\"3√ó1000 project\\". Conventional German bombers could reach Allied command centers in Great Britain, but were suffering devastating losses from Allied fighters. At the time, there was no way to meet these goals‚Äîthe new Junkers Jumo 004B turbojets could provide the required speed, but had excessive fuel consumption. The Hortens concluded that the low-drag flying wing design could meet all of the goals: by reducing the drag, cruise power could be lowered to the point where the range requirement could be met. They put forward their private project, the H.IX, as the basis for the bomber. The Government Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) approved the Horten proposal, but ordered the addition of two 30 mm cannons, as they felt the aircraft would also be useful as a fighter due to its estimated top speed being significantly higher than that of any Allied aircraft. The H.IX was of mixed construction, with the center pod made from welded steel tubing and wing spars built from wood. The wings were made from two thin, carbon-impregnated plywood panels glued together with a charcoal and sawdust mixture. The wing had a single main spar, penetrated by the jet engine inlets, and a secondary spar used for attaching the elevons. It was designed with a 7g load factor and a 1.8√ó safety rating; therefore, the aircraft had a 12.6g ultimate load rating. The wing's chord/thickness ratio ranged from 15% at the root to 8% at the wingtips. The aircraft utilized retractable tricycle landing gear, with the nosegear on the first two prototypes sourced from a He 177's tailwheel system, with the third prototype using an He 177A main gear wheelrim and tire on its custom-designed nosegear strutwork and wheel fork. A drogue parachute slowed the aircraft upon landing. The pilot sat on a primitive ejection seat. A special pressure suit was developed by Dr√§ger. The aircraft was originally designed for the BMW 003 jet engine, but that engine was not quite ready, and the Junkers Jumo 004 engine was substituted. Control was achieved with elevons and spoilers. The control system included both long-span (inboard) and short- span (outboard) spoilers, with the smaller outboard spoilers activated first. This system gave a smoother and more graceful control of yaw than would a single-spoiler system. Given the difficulties in design and development, Russell Lee, the chair of the Aeronautics Department at the National Air and Space Museum, suggests an important purpose of the project for the Horten Brothers was to prevent them and their workers from being assigned to more dangerous roles by the German military. Operational history =Testing and evaluation= glider The first prototype H.IX V1, an unpowered glider with fixed tricycle landing gear, flew on 1 March 1944. Flight results were very favorable, but there was an accident when the pilot attempted to land without first retracting an instrument-carrying pole extending from the aircraft. The design was taken from the Horten brothers and given to Gothaer Waggonfabrik. The Gotha team made some changes: they added a simple ejection seat, dramatically changed the undercarriage to enable a higher gross weight, changed the jet engine inlets, and added ducting to air-cool the jet engine's outer casing to prevent damage to the wooden wing. The H.IX V1 was followed in December 1944 by the Junkers Jumo 004-powered second prototype H.IX V2; the BMW 003 engine was preferred, but unavailable. G√∂ring believed in the design and ordered a production series of 40 aircraft from Gothaer Waggonfabrik with the RLM designation Ho 229, even though it had not yet taken to the air under jet power. The first flight of the H.IX V2 was made in Oranienburg on 2 February 1945. All subsequent test flights and development were done by Gothaer Waggonfabrik. By this time, the Horten brothers were working on a turbojet-powered design for the Amerika Bomber contract competition and did not attend the first test flight. The test pilot was Leutnant Erwin Ziller. Two further test flights were made: on 2 February 1945 and on 18 February 1945. Another test pilot used in the evaluation was . The H.IX V2 reportedly displayed very good handling qualities, with only moderate lateral instability (a typical deficiency of tailless aircraft). While the second flight was equally successful, the undercarriage was damaged by a heavy landing caused by Ziller deploying the brake parachute too early during his landing approach. There are reports that during one of these test flights, the H.IX V2 undertook a simulated \\"dog-fight\\" with a Messerschmitt Me 262, the first operational jet fighter, and that the H.IX V2 outperformed the Me 262. However, the Me 262 was considered by many as unsuitable for fighter missions, being slow in turning. Additionally, pilots and aiming devices had not yet adapted to the speed of jet aircraft, forcing pilots to slow their airplanes to accurately fire at bombers, leaving them momentarily at the reach of Allied gunmen. Two weeks later, on 18 February 1945, disaster struck during the third test flight. Ziller took off without any problems to perform a series of flight tests. After about 45 minutes, at an altitude of around 800 m, one of the Jumo 004 turbojet engines developed a problem, caught fire and stopped. Ziller was seen to put the aircraft into a dive and pull up several times in an attempt to restart the engine and save the precious prototype. Ziller undertook a series of four complete turns at 20¬∞ angle of bank. Ziller did not use his radio or eject from the aircraft. He may already have been unconscious as a result of the fumes from the burning engine. The aircraft crashed just outside the boundary of the airfield. Ziller was thrown from the aircraft on impact and died from his injuries two weeks later. The prototype aircraft was completely destroyed.\\"Horten Ho 229 V-2 (Ho IX V 2) der Absturz.\\" DeutscheLuftwaffe.de, Retrieved: 21 February 2016. Unloading of captured Horten Ho 229 V3 in the U.S. Despite this setback, the project continued with sustained energy. On 12 March 1945, nearly a week after the U.S. Army had launched Operation Lumberjack to cross the Rhine River, the Ho 229 was included in the J√§ger- Notprogramm (Emergency Fighter Program) for accelerated production of inexpensive \\"wonder weapons\\". The prototype workshop was moved to the Gothaer Waggonfabrik (Gotha) in Friedrichroda, western Thuringia. In the same month, work commenced on the third prototype, the Ho 229 V3. The V3 was larger than previous prototypes, the shape being modified in various areas, and it was meant to be a template for the pre-production series Ho 229 A-0 day fighters, of which 20 machines had been ordered. The V3 was meant to be powered by two Jumo 004C engines, with 10% greater thrust each than the earlier Jumo 004B production engine used for the Me 262A and Ar 234B, and could carry two MK 108 30 mm cannons in the wing roots. Work had also started on the two-seat Ho 229 V4 and Ho 229 V5 night-fighter prototypes, the Ho 229 V6 armament test prototype, and the Ho 229 V7 two-seat trainer. During the final stages of the war, the U.S. military initiated Operation Paperclip, an effort to capture advanced German weapons research, and keep it out of the hands of advancing Soviet troops. A Horten glider and the Ho 229 V3, which was undergoing final assembly, were transported by sea to the United States as part of Operation Seahorse for evaluation. On the way, the Ho 229 spent a brief time at RAE Farnborough in the UK, during which it was considered whether British jet engines could be fitted, but the mountings were found to be incompatibleBrown 2006, p. 119. with the early British turbojets, which used larger-diameter centrifugal compressors as opposed to the slimmer axial-flow turbojets the Germans had developed. The Americans were just starting to create their own axial-compressor turbojets before the war's end, such as the Westinghouse J30, with a thrust level only approaching the BMW 003A's full output. Surviving aircraft The only surviving Ho 229 airframe, the V3‚Äîand the only surviving World War II-era German jet prototype still in existence‚Äîhas been at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Paul E. Garber Restoration Facility in Suitland, Maryland, U.S. In December 2011, the National Air and Space Museum moved the Ho 229 into the active restoration area of the Garber Restoration Facility, where it was reviewed for full restoration and display. The central section of the V3 prototype was meant to be moved to the Smithsonian NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in late 2012 to commence a detailed examination of it before starting any serious conservation/restoration efforts and has been cleared for the move to the Udvar-Hazy facility's restoration shops as of summer 2014, with only the NASM's B-26B Marauder Flak Bait medium bomber ahead of it for restoration, within the Udvar-Hazy facility's Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar. As of early 2018, the surviving Horten Ho 229 has been moved to display in the main hall, alongside other WWII German aircraft. Claimed stealth technology =Radar absorbent material (RAM)= Cross-section of the Horten H.O.229 composite wood laminate After the war, Reimar Horten said he intended to mix charcoal dust in with the wood glue to absorb electromagnetic waves (radar), which he believed could shield the aircraft from detection by British early- warning ground-based radar that operated at 20 to 30 MHz, with a wavelength of 10 to 15m (top end of the HF band), known as Chain Home.\\"Flying under the Radar: A History of Stealth Planes.\\" National Geographic Channel, 2009.

In early 2008, Northrop Grumman paired up television documentary producer Michael Jorgensen and the National Geographic Channel to produce a documentary to determine whether the Ho 229 was the world's first true \\"stealth\\" fighter- bomber. Northrop Grumman built a full-size non-flying reproduction of the V3, made out of wood primarily, unlike the original aircraft which had an extensive steel space-frame to which the wooden skin was bolted. The space- frame for the real aircraft was made from steel tubes up to 160 mm in diameter, and provided the entire structure for the centre section of the aircraft.https://web.archive.org/web/20140912044314/https://hortenconservation.squarespace.com/how- is-it-constructed/ After an expenditure of about US$250,000 and 2,500 man- hours, Northrop's Ho 229 reproduction was tested at the company's RCS test range at Tejon, California, US where it was placed on a 15-metre (50 ft) articulating pole and exposed to electromagnetic energy sources from various angles at a distance of 100 m, using the same three HF/VHF-boundary area frequencies in the 20‚Äì50 MHz range.

It rises at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers in Franklin, New Hampshire, flows southward into Massachusetts, and then flows northeast until it empties into the Gulf of Maine at Newburyport. From Pawtucket Falls in Lowell, Massachusetts, onward, the Massachusetts‚ÄìNew Hampshire border is roughly calculated as the line three miles north of the river. The Merrimack is an important regional focus in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The central- southern part of New Hampshire and most of northeast Massachusetts is known as the Merrimack Valley. Several U.S. naval ships have been named and USS Merrimac in honor of this river. The river is perhaps best known for the early American literary classic A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers by Henry David Thoreau.  Etymology and spelling  The Merrimack River in Pembroke, New Hampshire Haverhill to its mouth in Newburyport, Massachusetts The etymology of the name of the Merrimack River - from which all subsequent uses derive, such as the name of the Civil War ironclad - remains uncertain. There is some evidence that it is Native American. In 1604 the natives of later New England told Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts, who was leading a colony of French language speakers to Acadia (later Nova Scotia), of a beautiful river to the south. The French promptly pronounced its native name as Merremack. In 1605 Samuel de Champlain followed this lead, found the river and renamed it Riviere du Gas. The French and their name did not remain on the Merrimack. The natives dwelling along the river at that time were the Agawam on the lower reaches, the Pawtucket at Lowell, Massachusetts, the Nashua, Souhegan and Namoskeag around Manchester, New Hampshire, the Pennacook northward from Bow, New Hampshire, and the Winnepisseogee at the source, Lake Winnipesaukee. These were all members of a nation of Algonquian speakers known as the Nipmuck, meaning \\"still water place\\".Meade 170 According to Joseph B. Walker,Pages 414-415. relying on Chandler Eastman Potter's The History of Manchester (1856), Merremack contains the elements merruh (\\"strong\\") and auke (\\"place\\"‚Äîa recognizable locative ending), and means \\"the place of strong current,- a term not inappropriate, when we consider ... the river's rapids ....\\" Potter was an authority on Native American affairs in colonial New England. By contrast, in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, Henry David Thoreau implies that \\"its name signifies the Sturgeon River.\\"Johnson 319 Walker goes on to cite spellings of \\"Merimacke\\", \\"Merimack\\" and \\"Merrimacke\\" in \\"the colonial records of Massachusetts\\", as well as the \\"Merrimake\\" and \\"Merrymake\\" of a 1721 land grant at Penacook, New Hampshire. William Wood's New England's Prospect of 1634 calls the river the \\"Merrimacke\\" and locates it eight miles beyond Agowamme (Ipswich, Massachusetts). It hosts, he says, \\"Sturgeon, Sammon and Basse, and divers other kinds of fish.\\"Currier (1902), page 23. Merrimac, Massachusetts, settled in 1638 and originally part of Amesbury, Massachusetts, was called West Amesbury until 1876, at which time it adopted its current name and spelling. Merrimack, New Hampshire, was incorporated in 1746, spelling its name \\"Marrymac\\" in the record of its first town meeting. It is referred to as \\"Merrimac\\" into the early 19th century: in the 1810 decennial census, it was spelled \\"Merrimac\\", but in the 1820 census and afterwards, \\"Merrimack\\". In 1914, US Congressman John Jacob Rogers (MA) petitioned that the official spelling be \\"Merrimack\\".Frederick W. Coburn, History of Lowell and Its People VI (1920)  History  Prior to glaciation, the Merrimack continued its southward course far beyond the present day New Hampshire-Massachusetts border to enter the Gulf of Maine near Boston. Upon the glacier's retreat, debris deposited north of Boston filled the lower Merrimack Valley, redirecting the river into its current northeast bend at Lowell. The Neville archaeological site is located along the river's banks in New Hampshire. On the Merrimack River's banks are a number of cities built to take advantage of water power in the 19th century, when textile mills dominated the New England economy: Concord, Manchester, and Nashua in New Hampshire, and Lowell, Lawrence, and Haverhill in Massachusetts. At the mouth of the river is the small city of Newburyport. Prior to the construction of the Middlesex Canal, Newburyport was an important shipbuilding city, in a location to receive New Hampshire timber that had been floated downriver. Geography The Merrimack River watershed covers in southern New Hampshire and northeastern Massachusetts. It is the fourth largest river basin in New England. The river begins in the city of Franklin, New Hampshire, at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers. From there, the river flows south through Concord, Manchester, and Nashua, entering Massachusetts at the town of Tyngsborough, where it turns northeast and winds past or through Chelmsford, Lowell, Dracut, Tewksbury, Andover, Methuen, Lawrence, North Andover, Haverhill, Groveland, West Newbury, Merrimac, and Amesbury, to its mouth at the Gulf of Maine between the city of Newburyport and the town of Salisbury. =Major sub- basins= In addition to the Merrimack River mainstem, there are dozens of sub-basins in New Hampshire and Massachusetts making up the watershed. The U.S. Geological Survey categorizes them into six fourth-level sub-basins using hydrological codes with the prefix 0107. ;New Hampshire * Pemigewasset River (HUC 01070001) * Winnipesaukee River (HUC 01070002) * Contoocook River (HUC 01070003) ;New Hampshire and Massachusetts * Nashua River (HUC 01070004) * Merrimack River (HUC 01070006; smaller tributaries) ;Massachusetts * Sudbury/Assabet/Concord rivers (sometimes referred to simply as the Concord Sub-basin or the \\"SuAsCo\\" sub-basin) (HUC 01070005) =Other major rivers= The following are some of the other significant rivers found within the six major sub-basins in the watershed, listed moving downstream along the Merrimack: * Soucook River * Suncook River * Piscataquog River (not to be confused with the Piscataqua River, part of the Piscataqua-Salmon Falls watershed) * Cohas Brook * Souhegan River * Salmon Brook * Stony Brook * Beaver Brook * Spicket River * Shawsheen River * Little River * Powwow River  Navigation  The Merrimack is listed as one of the Navigable Waters of the United States, subject to Section 10, Rivers and Harbors Act Jurisdiction.Navigable Waters of the United States in New England / Subject to Section 10, Rivers and Harbors Act Jurisdiction  May 2006 flooding  The flooded Merrimack River as seen from the Pawtucket Gatehouse in Lowell, Massachusetts Merrimack River in flood, October 2005, Manchester, New Hampshire While the Merrimack River is prone to minor flooding, on May 15, 2006, rainfall raised the river more than above flood stage, forcing evacuations, damaging property, and breaking the main sewage pipeline in the city of Haverhill, Massachusetts, dumping 35 million gallons of raw sewage waste into the river per day. Reports of total rainfall vary, but most areas appear to have received around a foot of rain with some areas receiving as much as . According to The Boston Globe, around 1,500 people evacuated their homes to escape the flood. This flood also prompted the Massachusetts city of Lowell to install a modern (albeit temporary) flood control gate comprising square steel beams at the site of the historic Francis Gate, a 19th and 20th- century wooden flood gate. When lowered, the Francis gate seals the city's canal system off from its source on the Merrimack. The Great Gate, as it is also called, was built in 1850 under the direction of James B. Francis. Considered unnecessary when it was first constructed, \\"Francis' Folly\\" first saved the city in 1852 and subsequently in 1936.  Other flooding events  The most significant flood in the recorded history of the Merrimack was in March 1936, when a double flood of rain and melting snow and ice swelled the Merrimack at Lowell to , higher than the 2006 flood. Part of the Jack Kerouac book Doctor Sax is set during this event. In addition to the 1936 flood, the 1852 flood, and the Mother's Day Flood of 2006, the New England Hurricane of 1938 and a flood in April 2007 round out the river's most serious flood events, measured at Lowell. The Francis Gate had been left in place after being dropped in 1936, so it prevented flooding in 1938 as well. In 2007, the steel beam system was again assembled in place.  In media  The song \\"Merrimack River\\" and its instrumental reprise are featured on the 2009 album Amanda Leigh by Nashua, New Hampshire, native Mandy Moore. Anya Seton's historical novel Avalon includes a section depicting the fictional Pre- Columbian arrival of 9th century Irish and English travelers at the Merrimack River and their interactions with local Native Americans.

Biography  =Early years= Wardell Gray was born in Oklahoma City, the youngest of four children. His early childhood years were spent in Oklahoma, before moving with his family to DetroitJoop Visser, \\"Dexter Gordon: Settin' the Pace\\", Proper Records, p23 in 1929. In early 1935, Gray began attending Northeastern High School, and then transferred to Cass Technical High School, which is noted for having Donald Byrd, Lucky Thompson and Al McKibbon as alumni. He left in 1936, before graduating. Advised by his brother-in-law Junior Warren, as a teenager he started on the clarinet, but after hearing Lester Young on record with Count Basie, he was inspired to switch to the tenor saxophone. Gray's first musical job was in Isaac Goodwin's small band, a part-time outfit that played local dances. When auditioning for another job, he was heard by Dorothy Patton, a young pianist who was forming a band in the Fraternal Club in Flint, Michigan, and she hired him. After a very happy year there, he moved to Jimmy Raschel's band (Raschel had recorded a few sides earlier in the 1930s but did not do so again) and then on to the Benny Carew band in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was at around this time that he met Jeanne Goings; together they had a daughter, Anita, who was born in January 1941. =With the Earl Hines Orchestra= Just up the road from the Congo Club was the Three Sixes;Owens, Keith A. \\"Hastings Street breakdown: The history of Detroit blues from Black Bottom to Belle Isle.\\" www2.metrotimes.com, July 25, 2000. Retrieved January 30, 2014. Jeri knew Earl Hines, and when the Hines band came through Detroit in late 1943, she persuaded Earl to hire Wardell‚Äîon alto, since there was no tenor vacancy at the time. This was a big break for the 21-year-old, as the Earl Hines Orchestra was not only nationally known, but it had nurtured the careers of some of the emerging bebop musicians, including Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Although most of them had left by the time Gray joined, playing with the Hines band was still a lively and stimulating experience for the young tenor player. They toured the country, and it was when they were in California that Gray met Dorothy Duvall. They were immediately attracted to one another. Dorothy was married but, although the marriage was on the point of collapse, an unfortunate intervention by a \\"friend\\" led Gray to believe that this was not so, and he returned to Jeri; they were married in Chicago in September 1945. Wardell spent approximately three years with Hines, and matured rapidly during this time. He soon became a featured soloist, and the band's recordings show a relaxed, fluent stylist very much in the Lester Young mold. While some of the live Jubilee sessions have been reissued on CD (1), the studio recordings from 1945-46 are still available only on LP. =Arrival on the West Coast= He left Hines late in 1946, settling in Los Angeles, California; soon after arriving there, he recorded the first session under his own name. This was a quartet session for Eddie Laguna's Sunset label, and on it Wardell had strong support from Dodo Marmarosa on piano. The date produced some excellent sides, notably \\"Easy Swing\\" and \\"The Man I Love\\"; there is a reissue of the whole session, including alternate takes (2), but a selection is available on (12). In Los Angeles, Wardell worked in a number of bands including Benny Carter, the blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, and the small group that supported singer Billy Eckstine on a tour of the West Coast. But the real focus in LA at this time was in the clubs along Central Avenue, which was still thriving after the boom years brought about by the huge injection of wartime defence spending. Here Wardell found his element, playing in the mainly after-hours sessions in clubs such as Jack's Basket Room, the Down Beat, Lovejoy's and the Club Alabam, and his early success in these sessions led Ross Russell to include him in a studio session he was organising for his Dial label. The session was designed as a showcase for Charlie Parker, but Wardell acquitted himself superbly, showing no sign at all of being over-awed by Parker's presence (3). It was in the Central Avenue clubs that Wardell held his tenor battles with Dexter Gordon. These two were ideally matched: Wardell's light sound and swift delivery were more than a match for Dexter's big, blustering sound, and their tenor jousts became a kind of symbol for the Central Avenue scene. Gordon later recalled: \\"There'd be a lot of cats on the stand but by the end of the session it would wind up with Wardell and myself.... His playing was very fluid, very clean.... He had a lot of drive and a profusion of ideas\\".Cited in Visser, pp. 24-25. Their fame began to spread, and Ross Russell managed to get them to simulate one of their battles on \\"The Chase\\" (4), which became Wardell's first nationally known recording and has been assessed as \\"one of the most exciting musical contests in the history of jazz\\". The success of \\"The Chase\\" was the break that Wardell needed, and he became increasingly prominent in public sessions in and around LA, including the \\"Just Jazz\\" series of jam sessions organised by the disc jockey Gene Norman. There were concerts at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium and the Shrine Auditorium and other venues (5, 6, 7). The session, which included \\"Just You, Just Me\\" and \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\", has some of Wardell's best playing, but the only CD version of this is crudely abbreviated. (Several unedited versions of these performances have since been issued.) A 1947 concert at the Elks Ballroom in Los Angeles featured both Wardell and Dexter Gordon, and included an 18-minute performance released on 8 78 RPM records as \\"The Hunt\\"; the entire concert has been released as a 3-CD set(21) =Benny Goodman and Count Basie= Apart from a spell with a small band led by Al Killian (some Jubilee recordings by this group (8) show Wardell in fine form) Wardell was still working mainly in one-off sessions during 1947. However, at a concert around the turn of that year which also featured Benny Goodman, Wardell so impressed the clarinettist that Goodman hired him for a small group which he was just setting up as part of his flirtation with bebop. Goodman had previously been highly critical of bop playing but, speaking of Wardell to Metronome magazine, he said that \\"if he's bop, that's great. He's wonderful!\\" Goodman's new group included the young Swedish clarinettist Ake \\"Stan\\" Hasselgard and, initially, Teddy Wilson, and it opened at Frank Palumbo's Click Club in Philadelphia in May 1948. Enthusiasts recorded the nightly broadcasts from the club, some of the best of which have been released on CD (9), and they contain some superbly relaxed, fluent tenor work from Wardell. There is little sign of bop in the group's playing, the only noticeable influence being in some of Wardell's phrasing and in aspects of Mary Lou Williams' arrangements for the band. The group was not, however, a financial success and Goodman eventually broke it up, but by now Wardell was fully established on the East Coast as an up-and-coming musician. For a while in late 1948/early 1949 he worked with the Count Basie Orchestra, while also managing to record with Tadd Dameron (10) and, in excellent quartet and quintet sessions, with Al Haig (11, 12). The quartet session included \\"Twisted\\", one of Wardell's best-known recordings which was used as the basis for a best-selling vocalese version by Annie Ross. Wardell left Basie in 1949 to return to Benny Goodman. However, life in the Goodman band became increasingly uncongenial for him. In addition, his marriage to Jeri was breaking up. Goodman was not an easy employer at the best of times and this, combined with the constant travelling, made Wardell increasingly unhappy: recordings of the band, both studio sessions (13) and live airshots (14, 15), feature work by Wardell that is below his own best standards. (That it is the Goodman surroundings that was the problem, rather than any fall-off in Wardell's ability, is shown in a session recorded with local musicians in Detroit (11, 18); Wardell's work on this session is exemplary). On leaving Goodman, Wardell rejoined Count Basie. Basie had bowed to economic pressures and broken up his big band, forming a septet which included Clark Terry and Buddy DeFranco; Wardell joined them in, probably, July 1950. This setting was a much happier one for him and the group enjoyed some success; airshots from the time show a very relaxed, swinging band with no weak links (16). It was during this good time from a musical point of view, that Wardell's personal life also became happier. He was finally divorced from Jeri and was at last free to marry Dorothy and, together with Dorothy's daughter, Paula, they set up in a little house in Los Angeles. The only drawback to working with Basie (who had by now enlarged his group again to big band size) was the constant travelling, and Wardell eventually decided to leave so that he could enjoy more home life. The decision was entirely understandable, though the Basie rhythm section was ideally suited to Wardell's brand of swing and, from a musical point of view, enthusiasts for his playing may regret his decision. And an unexpected side-effect was that, because work in the LA area was short (for black musicians, anyway) Wardell still had to travel frequently in search of jobs. Nevertheless, life at home was good, and one of the few interviews that he ever gave (to the British Melody Maker) showed that he was very happy. In 1950, Gray played a live concert at the San Francisco Veteran's Memorial Hall as a guest with Gerald Wilson's band. Remarkably captured in high fidelity stereo (the only such example in his discography), this recording was released for the first time in 2006 (17). Gray can be heard in fine form during featured solo spots with small combo backup on \\"Nice Work if You Can Get It\\" and \\"Indiana\\" and also with Wilson's big band on the blues \\"Hollywood Freeway\\" where Gray trades exciting choruses with Zoot Sims and Stan Getz. =The decline= At around this time his recording sessions started becoming fewer--though a live session with Dexter Gordon, recreating the excitements of Central Avenue, and a studio session with Art Farmer and Hampton Hawes (both on 18), have fine examples of Wardell's playing. However, there are increasing signs of a lack of engagement in Wardell's work around 1951/52, notably in a further live session with Dexter Gordon from February 1952 (5), and it seems that he may have been becoming disillusioned with the music business. That he was still capable of playing superbly is shown by his work on a live jam session at The Haig (19), but such sessions were by now very sparse, and more typical work from this period was recorded on a session with Teddy Charles (17). At around this time, Gray apparently became involved with drugs; friends reported that this was taking its toll. His playing was now less fluent, and a studio session in January 1955 (12), which was to be his last, shows strong but (by his own standards) rather unsubtle playing. =Disappearance and death= Gray was still working regularly despite his drug problems, and when Benny Carter was engaged in May 1955 to provide the band at the opening of the Moulin Rouge Hotel, he called on Gray. Gray attended rehearsals but was absent when the club opened on May 25. The next day he was found on a stretch of desert on the outskirts of Las Vegas dead with a broken neck. Although there was a poor examination of circumstances, by most accounts, Gray's demise was ruled an accidental death. Foul play was suspected by some, especially given Gray's possible association with mob boss Meyer Lansky. =In popular culture= James Ellroy's novel The Cold Six Thousand contains a reference to Gray's disappearance and death:James Ellroy, The Cold Six Thousand, Windmill Books, 2010, pp. 271, 284 and 372. according to this, he was murdered by (fictional) racist conspirator Wayne Tedrow, Sr. for having an affair with his wife, Janice. Bill Moody's book Death of a Tenor Man tells the story of a contemporary investigation of Wardell's death by fictional detective/pianist Evan Horne.Bill Moody, Death of a Tenor Man, Dark City Books, 2003. Jack Kerouac explicitly references Wardell in his novel On the Road: \\"They ate voraciously as Neal, sandwich in hand, stood bowed and jumping before the big phonograph listening to a wild bop record I just bought called 'The Hunt', with Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray blowing their tops before a screaming audience that gave the record fantastic frenzied volume.\\"Jack Kerouac, On the Road: The Original Scroll, Penguin Books, 2007, p 215. Joni Mitchell included a version of the Ross/Gray song \\"Twisted\\" on her double-platinum album Court and Spark.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest Test batsmen and best opening batsmen in Test cricket history, Gavaskar set world records during his career for the most Test runs and most Test centuries scored by any batsman. He held the record of 34 Test centuries for almost two decades before it was broken by Sachin Tendulkar in December 2005. He was the first person to score centuries in both innings of a Test match three times. He was the first Test batsman to score 10,000 Test runs in a career and now stands at number 12 on the group of 13 players with 10,000-plus Test runs. Gavaskar was widely admired for his technique against fast bowling, with a particularly high average of 65.45 against the West Indies team, who possessed a four-pronged fast bowling attack regarded as the most vicious in Test history. His captaincy of the Indian team, however, was less successful. Turbulent performances of the team led to multiple exchanges of captaincy between Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, with one of Gavaskar's sackings coming just six months before Kapil led India to victory at the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He is also a former Sheriff of Mumbai. Gavaskar is a recipient of the Indian civilian honours of the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2012, he was awarded the Col CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award for Cricket in India.  Domestic debut  Born in Mumbai and a student of St Xavier's High School young Sunil Gavaskar was named India's Best Schoolboy Cricketer of the year in 1966 while playing for his school. He scored 246*, 222 and 85 in school cricket in his final year of secondary education before striking a century against the touring London schoolboys. He made his first-class debut for Vazir Sultan Colts XI against an XI from Dungarpur in 1966/67 but remained in Bombay's Ranji Trophy squad for the next two years without playing a match. An alumnus of Bombay's renowned St. Xavier's College, he made his debut in the 1968/69 season against Karnataka but made a duck and was the subject of derisive claims that his selection was due to the presence of his uncle Madhav Mantri, a former Indian Test wicket keeper on Bombay's selection committee. He responded with 114 against Rajasthan in his second match and two other consecutive centuries saw him being selected in the 1970/71 Indian team to tour the West Indies.  Test debut  = First test match win in West Indies = After missing the first Test due to an infected fingernail, Gavaskar scored 65 and 67 not out in the second Test in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, hitting the winning runs which gave India its first-ever win over the West Indies. = First Test century and first series victory over West Indies = He followed this with his first century, 116 and 64* in the third Test in Georgetown, Guyana, and 1 and 117* in the Fourth Test in Bridgetown, Barbados. He returned to Trinidad for the fifth Test and scored 124 and 220 to help India to its first ever series victory over the West Indies, and the only one until 2006. His performance in the Test made him the second player after Doug Walters to score a century and double century in the same match. He also became the first Indian to make four centuries in one Test series, the second Indian after Vijay Hazare to score two centuries in the same Test, and the third after Hazare and Polly Umrigar to score centuries in three consecutive innings. He was the first Indian to aggregate more than 700 runs in a series, and this 774 runs at 154.80 remain the most runs scored in a debut series by any batsman. Trinidad Calypso singer Lord Relator (Willard Harris) wrote a song in Gavaskar's honour, the \\"Gavaskar Calypso\\". = England tour = Gavaskar's arrival in England in 1971 for a three-Test series generated substantial publicity in light of his debut series. He was unable to maintain his performance, making only two half-centuries. He was involved in controversy when taking a quick single from the bowling of John Snow. They collided, and Gavaskar fell over. Snow was charged with deliberately barging into Gavaskar and was suspended. Gavaskar's 144 runs at the low average of 24,Test Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Sunny Gavaskar, CricketArchive. Retrieved 5 September 2008. led some to question Gavaskar's worthiness for international cricket. = England tour of India = In 1972‚Äì73, England toured India for a five-Test series, Gavaskar's first on home soil. He was ineffective in the first three Tests, accumulating only sixty runs in five innings as India took a 2‚Äì1 lead. He scored some runs in the final two Tests which India drew to complete consecutive series wins over England. His first home series was largely disappointing, aggregating 224 runs at 24.89. His English critics were placated when India returned in 1974 and Gavaskar scored 101 and 58 in the second Test at Old Trafford. He managed 227 runs at 37.83 as India were whitewashed 3‚Äì0. = West Indies tour = Gavaskar's 1974‚Äì75 series against the West Indies was interrupted, playing in only the First and fifth and final Test of the series against the West Indies. He scored 108 runs at 27, with an 86 bowled by Lance Gibbs at Bombay's Wankhede Stadium hosting the first test on this ground, the closest the Indian public got to see a century. The Test was the start of a world record streak of 106 Test appearances. The 1975‚Äì76 season saw three and four Test tours of New Zealand and the West Indies, respectively. Gavaskar led India in a Test for the first time in January 1976 against New Zealand during the First Test in Auckland when regular captain Bishen Bedi was suffering from a leg injury. Standing in despite having scored only 703 runs at 28.12 since his debut series, Gavaskar rewarded the selectors with 116 and 35*. As a result, India secured an eight- wicket victory. He ended the series with 266 runs at 66.33. On the West Indian leg of the tour, Gavaskar scored consecutive centuries of 156 and 102 in the Second and Third Tests, both in Port of Spain, Trinidad. These were his third and fourth centuries at the grounds. In the Third Test, his 102 helped India post 4/406 to set a world record for the highest winning fourth innings score. The Indians' mastery of the Caribbean spinners on a turning track reportedly led West Indian captain Clive Lloyd to vow that he would rely on pace alone in future Tests. Gavaskar totalled 390 runs at 55.71 for the series.. = First home test century = Gavaskar was not to score a century on home soil until November 1976. In an eight-Test season, three and five against New Zealand and England, respectively, Gavaskar scored centuries in the first and last Tests of the season. The first was 119 in front of his home crowd at the Wankhede Stadium, helping India to a victory. Gavaskar scored another half-century in the Second Test to end the series with 259 at 43.16. In the First Test against England at Delhi, he was mobbed upon becoming the first Indian to reach 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year. A steady series saw him finish with 394 runs at 39.4 with a century coming in the Fifth Test and two half-centuries. = Tour of Australia = In 1977‚Äì78 he toured Australia, scoring three consecutive Test centuries (113, 127, 118) in the second innings of the first three Tests at Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne, respectively. India won the third but lost the earlier two. He finished the Five Test series with 450 runs at 50, failing twice as India lost the final Test and the series 3‚Äì2. = India Tour of Pakistan = 1978‚Äì79 saw India tour Pakistan for the first series between the arch-rivals for 17 years. For the first time, Gavaskar faced Pakistani pace spearhead Imran Khan, who described him as \\"The most compact batsman I've bowled to.\\" Gavaskar scored 89 in the First Test and 97 in the Second, which India drew and lost, respectively. Gavaskar saved his best for the Third Test in Karachi, scoring 111 and 137 in the Third, but was unable to prevent a defeat and series loss. His twin centuries made him the first Indian to score two centuries in one Test on two occasions, and saw him pass Umrigar as India's leading Test run-scorer. Gavaskar finished the series with 447 runs at 89.40.  Captaincy  Sunil Gavaskar's career performance graph.Gavaskar was captain of the Indian team on several occasions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although his record is less than impressive. Often equipped with unpenetrative bowling attacks he tended to use conservative tactics which resulted in a large number of draws. During his tenure, Kapil Dev emerged as a leading pace bowler for the country. He captained India to nine victories and eight losses, but most of the games were drawn, 30. = First test series as a captain = His first series in charge was a West Indian visit to India for a six Test series. Gavaskar's several large centuries contrasted with several failures. His 205 in the First Test made him the first Indian to score a double century in India against the West Indies. He added a further 73 in the second innings of a high scoring draw. After failing to score in the Second Test, he scored 107 and 182 not out in the Third Test at Calcutta, another high scoring draw. This made him the first player in Test history to achieve centuries in both innings of a Test three times. He managed only 4 and 1 in the Fourth Test in Madras as India forced the only win of the series. He posted a fourth century for the series, scoring 120 in the Fifth Test at Delhi, becoming the first Indian to pass 4000 Test runs. He aggregated 732 runs at 91.50 for the series, securing India a 1‚Äì0 win in his first series as captain. = Stripped of the captaincy = Despite this, he was stripped of the captaincy when India toured England in 1979 for a four Test tour. The official reason given was that Srinivas Venkataraghavan was preferred due to his superior experience on English soil, but most observers believed that Gavaskar was punished because he was believed to be considering defecting to World Series Cricket. He started consistently, scoring four half-centuries in five innings of the first three Tests. It was in the Fourth Test at The Oval that he produced his finest innings on English soil. India was 1‚Äì0 down needed to reach a world record target of 438 to square the series. They reached 76/0 at stumps on the fourth day. Led by Gavaskar, India made steady progress to be 328/1 with 20 overs remaining on the final day with a record-breaking victory still possible. An Ian Botham led fightback saw Gavaskar removed, with India still needing 49 runs from 46 balls. With three balls left in the match, all four results were possible. India ended nine runs short with two wickets in hand when stumps were drawn. According to Sanjay Manjrekar, it was \\"Vintage Gavaskar, playing swing bowling to perfection, taking his time initially and then opening up. Nothing in the air, everything copybook.\\" He ended the series with 542 runs at 77.42 and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. = Restored to captaincy = Gavaskar was restored to the captaincy for the gruelling 1979‚Äì80 season, with six Test home series against both Australia and Pakistan. The first two Tests against Australia were high scoring draws where only 45 wickets fell, with India taking a first-innings lead in both after making scores over 400. India broke through for a 153-run win in the Third Test at Kanpur, where Gavaskar scored 76. He made 115 in the Fourth Test in Delhi, where India were unable to convert a 212-run first innings lead, resulting in a draw. After another stalemate in the Fifth Test, Gavaskar scored 123 in the Sixth Test, where Australia collapsed by an innings after India posted their fourth first innings in excess of 400 for the series. The series against Pakistan was similarly high scoring, with four draws, three of which did not reach the fourth innings. India won the Third and Fifth Tests in Bombay and Madras. At Madras, he made 166 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 29 when India brought up the winning runs. Having secured the series 2‚Äì0, Gavaskar was removed from the captaincy for the drawn Sixth Test. This occurred because Gavaskar had refused to tour the West Indies for another series immediately afterwards, asking for a rest. As a result, Gundappa Viswanath was appointed so that he could prepare his leadership skills for the tour. In the end the tour did not go ahead as the West Indian board were not interested in a team without Gavaskar. The season ended with a one-off Test against England in Bombay, which India lost. In the 13 Tests that season, he made 1027 runs at 51.35 with three centuries and four half-centuries. This ended a 14-month span in which Gavaskar played in 22 Tests and the 1979 Cricket World Cup. In that time, he scored 2301 Test runs including eight centuries. = Australian Tour = The 1980‚Äì81 season saw Gavaskar returned as captain for the Australasian tour, but it was to be the start of an unhappy reign for Gavaskar and India. He managed only 118 runs at 19.66 in the three Tests against Australia, but his impact in Australia was for a controversial incident. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, when Gavaskar was given out by the Australian umpire Rex Whitehead, he ordered his fellow opener Chetan Chauhan off the field. Instead of abandoning the match, the Indian manager, SK Durani persuaded Chauhan to return to the match which India went on to win by 59 runs as Australia collapsed to 83 in their second innings. India drew the series 1‚Äì1 but the following three-Test series in New Zealand was to signal the start of a barren run of 19 Tests under Gavaskar of which India were to win only one and lose five. India lost to New Zealand 1‚Äì0, with Gavaskar managing 126 runs at 25.2. He finished the Oceania tour with 244 runs at 22.18, with only two half-centuries, making little impact. = England in India = The 1981‚Äì82 Indian season saw a hard-fought 1‚Äì0 series win over England in six Tests. India took the First Test, before five consecutive draws resulted, four of which did not even reach the fourth innings. Gavaskar made 172 in the Second Test at Bangalore and reached a half-century on three further occasions to compile 500 runs at 62.5. India reciprocated England's visit in 1982 for a three-Test series, which was lost 1‚Äì0. Gavaskar made 74 runs at 24.66 but was unable to bat in the Third Test. = Sri Lanka Tour = The 1982‚Äì83 subcontinental season started well for Gavaskar on an individual note, as he made 155 in a one-off Test against Sri Lanka in Madras. It was the first Test between the two nations, with Sri Lankan having only recently been awarded Test status. Despite this, India were unable to finish off their novice opponents, the draw heralding a start of a winless summer. India played in twelve Tests, losing five and drawing seven. The first series was a six Test tour to Pakistan. India started well enough, drawing the First Test in Lahore, with Gavaskar scoring 83. Pakistan then defeated India in three consecutive matches. In the Third Test in Faisalabad, Gavaskar managed an unbeaten 127 in the second innings to force Pakistan into a run chase, but the other two losses were substantial, both by an innings. Despite holding on for draws in the last two Tests, Gavaskar was replaced by Kapil Dev as captain after the 3‚Äì0 loss. Despite his team's difficulties, Gavaskar remained productive with 434 runs at 47.18 with a century and three half centuries. Gavaskar went on to the West Indies for a five Test tour purely as a batsman, but could not reproduce the form that he had shown in the Caribbean in 1971 and 1976. He managed only 240 runs at 30, as India were crushed 2‚Äì0 by the world champions. Apart from an unbeaten 147 in the drawn Third Test in Georgetown, Guyana, his next best effort was 32. The 1983‚Äì84 season started with a home series against Pakistan, with all three matches being drawn. Gavaskar scored an unbeaten 103 in the First Test in Bangalore, and made two further half centuries to total 264 runs at 66. = Overtaking Bradman's test record = The Pakistan series was followed by a six Test series against the touring West Indies at the height of their powers. The First Test was held in Kanpur and India were crushed by an innings. Gavaskar had his bat knocked out of his hand by a hostile delivery from Malcolm Marshall before being dismissed. In the Second Test in Delhi, Gavaskar delivered his riposte to Marshall, hooking him for a consecutive four and six to start his innings. Gavaskar, unwilling to be dictated to by the Caribbean pacemen, hooked the short-pitched barrage relentlessly, reaching his half century in 37 balls. He then went on to score 121, his 29th Test century in 94 balls in his 95th test match, equalling Don Bradman's world record. He also passed 8,000 Test runs in the innings, and was personally honoured by Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India at the ground. The match was drawn. Gavaskar's 90 in the Third Test at Ahmedabad saw him pass Geoff Boycott's Test world record of 8,114 career runs, but was insufficient to prevent another defeat. During the Fifth Test in the series, India were defeated by an innings at Calcutta to concede a 3‚Äì0 series lead. India had won only one of their 32 most recent Tests and none of their last 28. The crowd singled out the Gavaskar, who had made a golden duck and 20. Angry spectators pelted objects onto the playing arena and clashed with police, before stoning the team bus. In the Sixth Test in Madras, he compiled his 30th Test century in his 99th test match, with an unbeaten 236 which was the highest Test score by an Indian. It was his 30th Test century and third double century against the West Indies, propelling him to overtake Donald Bradman's 29 test centuries record. He had aggregated 505 at 50.50 for the series. = Failure to win for successive Tests = With India having failed to win for 29 successive Tests, Kapil was sacked as captain and Gavaskar resumed leadership at the start of the 1984‚Äì85 season. The two Test tour of Pakistan resulted in two further draws, with Gavaskar compiling 120 runs at 40. The First Test against England saw India break through for its first Test victory in 32 matches. It proved to be a false dawn, with England squaring the series 1‚Äì1 in Delhi before another controversial Third Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta. The hostile crowd watched as India batted for over two days to reach 7/437 after 203 overs. Angry with the slow pace of India's innings, the crowd chanted \\"Gavaskar down! Gavaskar out!\\" blaming him for India' performance. The local police chief reportedly asked Gavaskar to declare to placate the angry crowd. When Gavaskar led his team onto the field, he was pelted with fruit. Gavaskar vowed never to play at Eden Gardens again, and duly withdrew from the team for India's next fixture at the Bengali capital two years later, ending his record of 106 consecutive Tests. The match was drawn, but India conceded the series after losing the Fourth. The series ended 1‚Äì2, and with a poor display of 140 runs at 17.5, Gavaskar resigned, although he had already announced his intention to relinquish the leadership before the series. The change of captain improved the form of neither Gavaskar nor India as they toured Sri Lanka for a three-Test series. India were embarrassed 1‚Äì0 by the Test minnows at the time, with Gavaskar managing only 186 runs at 37.2.  International farewell  In 1985‚Äì86, India toured Australia, playing against a team in a poor form slump. India were unable to capitalise as all three Tests were drawn, but Gavaskar did. He scored an unbeaten 166 in the First Test in Adelaide and 172 in the Third Test in Sydney, ending the series with 352 runs at 117.33. A three-Test tour of England saw him score only 185 runs at 30.83, which India won 2‚Äì0 despite his unproductivity. In 1986‚Äì87, Gavaskar's final season in Test cricket, India faced a long season of eleven home Tests. Against a team regarded as the worst to leave Australian shores, Gavaskar made 90 in the second innings of the First Test in Madras (now Chennai), giving India a chance to reach the target of 348, which ended in a tie. He scored 103 in the Third Test to end the series with 205 runs at 51.66. The First Test against Sri Lanka in Kanpur saw Gavaskar's 34th and final Test century of 176. He scored 74 and 5 in the next two Tests as India won the three-match series 2‚Äì0. The five-Test series against arch enemies Pakistan was to be his last. Gavaskar scored 91 in the drawn First Test in Madras before withdrawing from the Second Test in Calcutta as he had promised. In the Fourth Test in Ahmedabad, Gavaskar's 63 made him the first batsman to pass 10,000 runs. With the teams locked 0‚Äì0 leading into the final Test in Bangalore, there was to be no fairytale. Gavaskar was dismissed for 96 in the second innings as India were bowled out to give Pakistan a 1‚Äì0 series win.  Style  Gavaskar was also a fine slip fielder and his safe catching in the slips helped him become the first Indian (excluding wicket-keepers) to take over a hundred catches in Test matches. In one ODI against Pakistan in Sharjah in 1985, he took four catches and helped India defend a small total of 125. Early in his Test career, when India rarely used pace bowlers, Gavaskar also opened the bowling for a short spell on occasions if only one pace bowler was playing, before a three-pronged spin attack took over. The only wicket claimed by him is that of Pakistani Zaheer Abbas in 1978‚Äì79. While Gavaskar could not be described as an attacking batsman, he had the ability of keeping the scoreboard ticking with unique shots such as the \\"late flick\\". His focus of technical correctness over flair meant that his style of play was usually less suited to the shorter form of the game, at which he had less success. His infamous 36 not out in the 1975 World Cup, carrying his bat through the full 60 overs against England, led Indian supporters to storm the field and confront him for scoring so slowly when India needed nearly a run a ball to win; at the end of the game India had lost only three wickets but scored 200 runs less than England. Gavaskar almost went through his career without scoring a one-day century. He managed his first (and only ODI century) in the 1987 World Cup, when he hit 103 not out against New Zealand in his penultimate ODI innings at Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur.He scored 103 not out in just 88 balls.

He sparked a controversy in early 2008 for his comments on the contentious Sydney Test Match: \\"Millions of Indians want to know if it (match referee Mike Procter's verdict against Harbhajan Singh) was a 'white man' taking the 'white man's' word against that of the 'brown man'. Quite simply, if there was no audio evidence, nor did the officials hear anything, then the charge did not stand.\\"Quoted in Brown 2008. Despite the fact that Gavaskar's comment referenced Mike Procter and not the ICC, Australian writer Gideon Haigh said that, if Gavaskar genuinely believed this, \\"then he should almost certainly resign, for if the ICC is a bastion of 'white man's justice', Gavaskar bears some of the blame for having failed to change it.

Dunbar is a former royal burgh, and gave its name to an ecclesiastical and civil parish. The parish extends around east to west and is deep at its greatest extent, or , and contains the villages of West Barns, Belhaven, East Barns (abandoned) and several hamlets and farms. Its strategic location gave rise to a history full of incident and strife; but Dunbar has become a dormitory town popular with workers in nearby Edinburgh. Until the 1960s, the population of the town was little more than 3,500. In 2010 the population was 8,486,\\"Dunbar Locality 2010\\". Scotland's Census. 2001-04-29. Retrieved 2008-09-02. and there are many active and planned housing developments ongoing. There are primary schools, a secondary school and a private school in the town. The town is served by Dunbar railway station with links to Edinburgh and the rest of Scotland, as well as London and stations along the north-east corridor. Dunbar is home to the Dunbar Lifeboat Station, the second-oldest RNLI station in Scotland. Dunbar is the birthplace of the explorer, naturalist and influential conservationist John Muir. The house in which Muir was born is located on the High Street, and has been converted into a museum. There is also a commemorative statue beside the town clock, and John Muir Country Park is located to the north-west of the town. The eastern section of the John Muir Way coastal path starts from the harbour. One of the two campuses to Dunbar Primary School: John Muir Campus, is named in his honour. On the last full weekend in September, Dunbar holds an annual weekend- long, traditional music festival sponsored by various local companies. History =Etymology= In its present form, the name Dunbar is derived from its Gaelic equivalent (modern Scottish Gaelic: '), meaning \\"summit fort\\". That itself is probably a Gaelicisation of the Cumbric form ', with the same meaning. This form seems to be attested as Dynbaer the seventh-century Vita Sancti Wilfredi.Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html). =Early history= To the north of the present High Street an area of open ground called Castle Park preserves almost exactly the hidden perimeter of an Iron Age promontory fort. The early settlement was a principal centre of the people known to the Romans as Votadini and it may have grown in importance when the great hillfort of Traprain Law was abandoned at the end of the 5th century AD. Dunbar was subsumed into Anglian Northumbria as that kingdom expanded in the 6th century and is believed to be synonymous with the Dynbaer of Eddius around 680, the first time that it appears in the written record. The influential Northumbrian monk and scholar St Cuthbert, born around 630, was probably from around Dunbar. While still a boy, and employed as a shepherd, one night he had a vision of the soul of Saint Aidan being carried to heaven by angels and thereupon went to the monastery of Old Melrose and became a monk. It was then a king's vill and prison to Bishop Wilfrid. As a royal holding of the kings of Northumbria, the economy centred on the collecting of food renders and the administration of the northern (now Scottish) portion of that kingdom. It was the base of a senior royal official, a reeve (later sheriff), and, perhaps, in the 7th century a dynasty of ealdormen or sub-kings who held northern Northumbria against Pictish encroachment. =Scottish conquest= Danish and Norse attacks on southern Northumbria caused its power to falter and the northern portion became equally open to annexation by Scotland. Dunbar was burnt by Kenneth MacAlpin in the 9th century. Scottish control was consolidated in the next century and when Lothian was ceded to Malcolm II after the battle of Carham in 1018, Dunbar was finally an acknowledged part of Scotland. Throughout these turbulent centuries Dunbar‚Äôs status must have been preserved because it next features as part of a major land grant and settlement by Malcolm III in favour of the exiled earl Gospatric of Northumbria (to whom he may have been full cousin) during 1072. Malcolm needed to fill a power vacuum on his south-eastern flank; Gospatric required a base from which to plot the resumption of his Northumbrian holding. The grant included Dunbar and, it can be deduced, an extensive swath of East Lothian and Berwickshire or Merse (hence March). Gospatric founded the family of Dunbar. The head of the House of Dunbar filled the position of Earls of Dunbar and March until the 15th century. Bass Rock from Dunbar =Later history= Seal of Dunbar from Samuel Lewis Seal of Dunbar from Groome's Gazetteer The town became successively a baronial burgh and royal burgh (1370) and grew slowly under the shadow of the great Castle of the Earls. Scotland and England contended often for control of the castle and the town. The former was \\"impregnable\\" and withstood many sieges; the latter was burnt, frequently. The castle had been slighted (deliberately ruined) in 1568 but the town flourished as an agricultural centre and fishing port despite tempestuous times in the seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries. Major battles were fought nearby in 1296 and 1650. The second Battle of Dunbar (1650) was fought during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms between a Scottish Covenanter army and English Parliamentarians led by Oliver Cromwell. The Scots were routed, leading to the overthrow of the monarchy and the occupation of Scotland. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Castle Park Barracks in 1855. Dunbar gained a reputation as a seaside holiday and golfing resort in the nineteenth century, the \\"bright and breezy burgh\\" famous for its \\"bracing air\\". Since 1983, the town has held the first outdoor Pipe Band competition of the season in Scotland. The competition, now held at Hallhill Sports Centre on the second Saturday in May, attracts in the region of 70‚Äì80 entries from bands across Scotland and over 2,000 visitors for the day. The local band, Dunbar Royal British Legion Pipe Band, has competed with success over the years. On Saturday 3 January 1987, a devastating fire destroyed much of the town's historic parish church. The church, as it was before the fire, was opened in 1821 and contained a monument to the Earl of Dunbar (1611) which was said to be unequalled throughout Scotland for its Italian craftsmanship in marble. Though the fire practically destroyed the monument and left only the outer walls remaining, the church has since been rebuilt with a modern interior.

Archaeology During 2003, archaeological excavations at Oxwell Mains (Lafarge Cement Works) near Dunbar revealed the site of a Mesolithic house believed to be from around the 9th millennium BC. The site suggests a domed building. Although considered extremely rare and a site of national importance this site is in the middle of an area planned for quarrying. An archaeological excavation undertaken by Headland Archaeology on a site previously occupied by the Captain's Cabin (a local landmark) within the area of Castle Park identified a sequence of archaeological features reflecting around 2,000 years of human activity. The earliest feature was a large ditch which may have formed part of the defences around a promontory fort previously identified during earlier excavations near the coast at Castle Park. The scale of the ditches indicated an impressive monument. A radiocarbon date of between 50 BC and AD 70 was obtained from charcoal recovered from its infill. Much later a rectangular building was built over the top of the infilled ditch. Large quantities of burnt grain were recovered indicating that the building was a grain store that had been destroyed by fire. It was established that this was part of the Anglian settlement that had also been identified during earlier excavations. Between the 9th and 11th centuries the area was used as a cemetery. Archeologists excavated 76 articulated skeletons and the disarticulated remains of a further 51 individuals were recovered. The articulated skeletons were all buried in the standard Christian fashion. A small number of the skeletons were in long cists but the majority were simple shroud burials. A dump or midden above the cemetery contained many elephant ivory off-cuts dating to the 18th or 19th centuries. Climate As with most of the British Isles, Dunbar has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb) with cool summers and mild winters. It is one of the sunniest and driest places in Scotland, with around 1,450 hours of sunshine and of rainfall annually. Temperature extremes range from in August 1990 to in January 1982. Environment Due to its geographical location, Dunbar receives less rain and more hours of direct sunshine per year than most places in Scotland. The town has begun to be referred to by locals as 'Sunny Dunny', after a local radio host popularised the term. View towards Belhaven Bay (John Muir Country Park) with North Berwick Law and Bass Rock in the distance. Dunbar has two promenades (forming part of the John Muir Way). These provide an ideal viewpoint to see Dunbar's geological features: including volcanic deposits and dykes; seen from a high vantage point on the western, clifftop promenade, which passes the town's Public and Winterfield parks. Looking down onto a raised shore platform, and the raised beaches, further along the coast, one can get an appreciation of the glacial-isostatic uplift that has occurred in this part of Scotland. Ordnance Survey Tide Gauge House, Dunbar Harbour Economy The town has an Asda supermarket and a range of local shops. The store is accompanied by a drive-thru McDonald's built in late-2015 (also the first of its kind in East Lothian), a restaurant owned by Marston's named the Pine Marten, a hotel also owned by Marston's and a garden centre. Agriculture remains important, but fishing has declined. Its main manufacturers are cement at Tarmac's Dunbar Cement Plant at Oxwell Mains (the only integrated cement plant in Scotland) and the Scottish Ales of Belhaven Brewery. Another large local employer is Torness Nuclear Power Station. More recently Dunbar has become a base for many adventure sports with a local surf school and wakeboarding park. Alongside, activities including coasteering, stand up paddle boarding, a ropes course and zip lining are also increasingly popular.

History Marc Gunn, formerly of Austin Texas' alternative rock bands Skander and Breastfed, released a solo album (Geography) featuring himself on autoharp and Andrew McKee on recorder in 1998. This initial collaboration lead to the official formation of the Brobdingnagian Bards in 1999. The group's name is derived from Brobdingnag, the kingdom of coarse giants described in Jonathan Swift's satirical novel Gulliver's Travels. The band was made up of its original two members, Marc Gunn (autoharp, vocals), and Andrew McKee (recorder, mandolin, vocals). The Brobdingnagian Bards musical style is best described as a mixture of Irish and Scottish folk music, with their original compositions often falling into the filk genre. Although the pair did perform a good deal of purely traditional songs, it is the band's own works that set them apart, with their humorous pop-culture and sci-fi parodies. Despite performing in what is considered a \\"niche\\" genre, this duo was ranked as one of the top 20 bands on the original MP3.com. Over time, the Bards also honed their act into live entertainment by adding comedy, with McKee being the \\"straight-man\\" to Gunn's antics. As a result, they also became a familiar and popular act on both the renaissance faire and geek-show circuits. The Bards had the honor of being headliners at the Oscar party for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. As Austin natives, they make regular appearances in the Austin Chronicle's annual Austin Music Awards poll, taking home the #1 prize for \\"Best Novelty Band\\" in 2004, \\"Best None of the Above\\" performing band in 2006 (the first Celtic band to ever win such accolades), and \\"Best Folk Act\\" in 2007. The band also makes regular top-ten finishes in the folk band and world music categories.The Austin Chronicle: Austin Music Awards In 2002, the Bards were also given a critic's pick award for \\"Best Renaissance Men\\" in the 2002 Best of Austin awards.The Austin Chronicle: Best of Austin In addition to the many conventions, faires and music festivals the group performed at around the Austin area, they also have toured coast to coast, and developed a following of devoted listeners, referred to as \\"Nagians.\\" In 2007 and 2008, the Bards with several of their fans took a vacation tour of Ireland. On September 15, 2008, the Brobdingnagian Bards band broke up amicably in order to pursue solo careers. They played one of their last public performances at The Browncoat Ball, organized by the Austin Browncoats. The Bards performed at the 2012 Sherwood Celtic Music Festival near Austin. http://www.bardbootlegs.com/bbp-31-announcing-sherwood-celtic-music-festival- reunion/ The Bards performed at DragonCon in Atlanta, GA in August 2013, 2016 and 2018.

(August 2000) \\"Defining the New Spirituality, CESNUR 14th International Conference, Riga, Latvia: \\"One possible suggestion is that religion demands exclusive allegiance: this would ipso facto exclude Scientology, TM and the Soka Gakkai simply on the grounds that they claim compatibility with whatever other religion the practitioner has been following. For example, TM is simply ‚Äì as they state ‚Äì a technique. Although it enables one to cope with life, it offers no goal beyond human existence (such as moksha), nor does it offer rites or passage or an ethic. Unlike certain other Hindu-derived movements, TM does not prescribe a dharma to its followers ‚Äì that is to say a set of spiritual obligations deriving from one's essential nature.\\" He became known as Maharishi (meaning \\"great seer\\") and Yogi as an adult.Mason (1994), p. 28 Maharishi Mahesh Yogi became a disciple and assistant of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the Shankaracharya (spiritual leader) of Jyotirmath in the Indian Himalayas. The Maharishi credits Brahmananda Saraswati with inspiring his teachings. In 1955, the Maharishi began to introduce his Transcendental Deep Meditation (later renamed Transcendental Meditation) to India and the world. His first global tour began in 1958. His devotees referred to him as His Holiness, and because he often laughed in TV interviews he was sometimes referred to as the \\"giggling guru\\". The Maharishi is reported to have trained more than 40,000 TM teachers, taught the Transcendental Meditation technique to \\"more than five million people\\" and founded thousands of teaching centres and hundreds of colleges, universities and schools, while TM websites report tens of thousands learned the TM-Sidhi programme. His initiatives include schools and universities with campuses in several countries including India, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. The Maharishi, his family and close associates created charitable organisations and for-profit businesses including health clinics, mail-order health supplements and organic farms. The reported value of the Maharishi's organization has ranged from the millions to billions of U.S. dollars and in 2008, the organization placed the value of their United States assets at about $300 million. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Maharishi achieved fame as the guru to the Beatles, the Beach Boys and other celebrities. In the late 1970s, he started the TM-Sidhi programme that claimed to offer practitioners the ability to levitate and to create world peace. The Maharishi's Natural Law Party was founded in 1992, and ran campaigns in dozens of countries. He moved to near Vlodrop, the Netherlands, in the same year. In 2000, he created the Global Country of World Peace, a non-profit organization, and appointed its leaders. In 2008, the Maharishi announced his retirement from all administrative activities and went into silence until his death three weeks later.Srinivasan, 2008. Hinduism For Dummies. John Wiley & Sons. Life =Birth= Maharishi Mahesh Yogi belonged to the Kayastha caste, a subcast of scribes and administrators, of the Hindu religion. The birth name and the birth dates of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi are not known with certainty, in part because of the tradition of ascetics and monks to relinquish family connections.Coplin, Ch. 2, Socio-Historical Context for SRM's Emergence, Footnote #73: \\"Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's caste background is a matter of some uncertainty because it is the tradition of yogis, ascetics, and renunciants to relinquish their family ties. His education and family status are known by many long-time movement members, however. Shrivastava is the family name of his cousins and nephews, and that name can be traced to the Hindu Kayasthas.\\" Many accounts say he was born Mahesh Prasad Varma () into a Kayastha family living in the Central Provinces of British India.Humes, p. 61 A different name appears in the Allahabad University list of distinguished alumni, where he is listed as M.C. SrivastavaDistinguished Alumni. Allahabad University and an obituary says his name was \\"Mahesh Srivastava\\". Various accounts give the year of his birth as 1911, 1917 or 1918. Authors Paul Mason and William Jefferson say that he was born 12 January 1917 in Jabalpur, Central Provinces, British India (now Madhya Pradesh, India).Kroll, Una (1974) The Healing Potential of Transcendental Meditation, John Knox Press. Ch. 1: The Guru, pp 17‚Äì25. Jefferson, William (1976) The Story of The Maharishi, Pocket Books. pp 7‚Äì21. The place of birth given in his passport is \\"Pounalulla\\", India, and his birth date 12 January 1918. Mahesh came from an upper-caste family, being a member of the Kayastha caste, a high-status caste whose traditional profession is writing.Lewis, James (2001) Prometheus Books, Odd Gods, New Religions and the Cult Controversy, pp 230‚Äì233,Coplin, p. 48: \\"Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . . . was most likely born into a family of Hindu Kayasthas, a well-known and high- status literary caste of Hindustan ‚Äì with reference to varna, a kshatryia not a brahmin jati\\". =Early life= Mahesh studied physics at Allahabad University and earned a degree in 1942. While a few sources say that he worked at the Gun Carriage Factory in Jabalpur for some time,Coplin, Ch.2, footnote 74 most report that in 1941, he became an administrative secretary to the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \\"divine teacher\\")Humes, pp. 59‚Äì60.Williamson, p. 81 and took a new name, Bal Brahmachari Mahesh.Mason (1994), p. 22 Coplin refers to bala brahmachari as both a title and a name, and considers that it \\"identified him as a fully dedicated student of spiritual knowledge and life-long celibate ascetic.\\"Coplin, Ch. 3, SRM as Cultural Revitalization Text: \\"While his association with the illustrious Shankaracharya tradition served as vital letter of introduction throughout India, his title, \\"bala brahmachari\\" identified him as a fully dedicated student of spiritual knowledge and life- long celibate ascetic. Literally, the name means \\"childhood or boy\\" (bala) \\"student of sacred knowledge\\" (brahmachari), and it has signified from Vedic times one who has taken the vow of chastity.\\" Saraswati insisted that before accepting Mahesh as a pupil he must first complete his university degree and get permission from his parents. The Maharishi recalls how it took about two and a half years to attune himself to the thinking of Brahmananda Saraswati and to gain \\"a very genuine feeling of complete oneness\\".'Thirty Years Around the World- Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment', MVU, 1986, pp185-6 At first Brahmachari Mahesh performed common chores but gained trust and became Guru Dev's \\"personal secretary\\"Chryssides, George D. (1999). Exploring new religions. London: Cassell. pp. 293‚Äì296. . Page 293 and \\"favored pupil\\". He was trusted to take care of the bulk of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati's correspondence without direction, and was also sent out to give public speeches on Vedic (scriptural) themes. The Maharishi said his life truly began in 1940, at the feet of his master, when he learned the secret of swift and deep meditation. Brahmachari Mahesh remained with Swami Brahmananda Saraswati until the latter died in 1953, when he moved to Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand in the Himalayas where he undertook a reclusive life for two years. Although Brahmachari Mahesh was a close disciple, he could not be the Shankaracharya's spiritual successor because he was not of the Brahmin caste.Williamson, p. 84: \\"Guru Dev represented the tradition well, for he did not allow anyone who was not of the Brahmin varna, the caste of the priesthood, to teach. Since Mahesh was born into a scribe caste (kayastha), he was not allowed to join the order of monks. Thus when Saraswati died in Calcutta in 1953, Mahesh would not have been considered a candidate to replace him.\\"Coplin, p. 49: \\"Because he was not a brahmin, Mahesh could not become a member of the dandi sannyasi order and succeed his master as Shankaracharya; the honor passed to Swami Shantanand Saraswati in June, 1953.\\" (This from an interview by the author with the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, Swami Vishnudevananda Saraswati on 12 June 1983.) The Shankaracharya, at the end of his life, charged him with the responsibility of travelling and teaching meditation to the masses, while he named Swami Shantananda Saraswati as his successor.Mason (1994), pp. 23‚Äì24 =Tour in India (1955‚Äì1957)= In 1955, Brahmachari Mahesh left Uttarkashi and began publicly teaching what he stated was a traditional meditation technique learned from his master Brahmananda Saraswati, and that he called Transcendental Deep Meditation.Williamson, pp. 97‚Äì99 Later the technique was renamed Transcendental Meditation.Russell, p. 25 It was also then that he was first publicly known with the name \\"Maharishi\\" an honorific title meaning \\"great sage\\" after the title was given to him according to some sources from \\"Indian Pundits\\" and according to another source the honorific was given along with Yogi by followers in India. Later in the west the title was retained as a name.Bajpai, R.S. (2002) Atlantic Publishers, The Splendours And Dimensions of Yoga 2 Vols. Set, page 554, \\"received the title Maharishi, from some Indian Pundits\\" He traveled around India for two yearsMason (1994) pp. 27‚Äì34 interacting with his \\"Hindu audiences\\" in an \\"Indian context\\". At that time, he called his movement the Spiritual Development Movement, but renamed it the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in 1957, in Madras, India, on the concluding day of the Seminar of Spiritual Luminaries. According to Coplin, in his visits to southern India, the Maharishi spoke English rather than the Hindi spoken in his home area to avoid provoking resistance among those seeking linguistic self-determination, and to appeal to the \\"learned classes\\".Coplin, Ch. 2, Socio-Historical Context for SRM's Emergence: \\"In South India Maharishi spoke in English because his Hindi would not only be little understood outside of the North, but it would provoke hostility among many who were fighting for linguistic self-determination in the period immediately following Independence. The use of English, however, had greater connotations, as it presumed an audience of Indians familiar with British administration and education. More significantly, it appealed to the 'learned classes', mostly brahmins, but also lower caste officials whose families had escaped their more humble backgrounds by means of acquiring an English education.\\" =World tours (1958‚Äì1968)= According to William Jefferson, in 1958, the Maharishi went to Madras to address a large crowd of people who had gathered to celebrate the memory of Guru Dev. It was there that he spontaneously announced that he planned to spread the teaching of TM throughout the world. Hundreds of people immediately asked to learn TM. In 1959, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began his first world tour, writing: \\"I had one thing in mind, that I know something which is useful to every man\\". The Maharishi's 1986 book, Thirty Years Around the World, gives a detailed account of his world tours, as do two biographies, The Story of the Maharishi, by William Jefferson, and The Maharishi by Paul Mason. The first world tour began in Rangoon, Burma (now Myanmar) and included the countries of Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong and Hawaii.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 237 \\"Summary 1958: The first countries he visited on his first world tour were Burma, Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong and the USA (Hawaii).\\"Mason (1994), p. 34 He arrived in Hawaii in the spring of 1959 and the Honolulu Star Bulletin reported: \\"He has no money, he asks for nothing. His worldly possessions can be carried in one hand. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is on a world odyssey. He carries a message that he says will rid the world of all unhappiness and discontent.\\"Mason (1994), p. 37: \\"He has no money; he asks for nothing. His worldly possessions can be carried in one hand. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is on a world odyssey. He carries a message that he says will rid the world of all unhappiness and discontent...\\" In 1959, the Maharishi lectured and taught the Transcendental Meditation technique in Honolulu, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, New York and London.Mason (1994), pp. 41‚Äì46Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 275 \\"Summary 1959: In January Maharishi travelled to the [mainland] USA for the first time, establishing the movement in Hawaii and then moving on to San Francisco and Los Angeles. Towards the end of the year, he once again visited Hawaii, then flew to the East Coast cities of Boston and New York\\" While in Los Angeles the Maharishi stayed at the home of author Helena Olson,Olson, Helena, Hermit in the House, p. 44, Los Angeles, 1967 and during this period he developed a three-year plan to propagate Transcendental Meditation to the whole world. Though most of his audience consisted of average middle class individuals, he also attracted a few celebrities, such as Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Nancy Cooke de Herrera and Doris Duke. Michael Cooper, Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Shepard Sherbell and Brian Jones; sitting: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (Concertgebouw Amsterdam, 1967) When the Maharishi came to the U.S. in 1959, his Spiritual Regeneration Movement was called Transcendental Meditation. That same year he began the International Meditation Society and other organizations to propagate his teachings, establishing centres in San Francisco and London. For years, the sole teacher of Transcendental Meditation in America was a San Diego woman named Beulah Smith. In 1960, the Maharishi travelled to many cities in India, France, Switzerland, England, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Africa.Mason (1994), pp. 52‚Äì54Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) pp. 318‚Äì320 Note: The source contains a 3-page itinerary of 40+ cities visited by the Maharishi with corresponding dates of visit ranging from 1/1/60 and 12/30/60, \\"Summary 1960: Maharishi brought TM to the countries of Europe and in his many lectures in England, Scotland, Norway, and Germany he...\\"\\"In the first half of the year he visited France, Switzerland, Austria and Germany.\\" \\"...then travelled to the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Denmark and Sweden.\\" While in Manchester, England, the Maharishi gave a television interview and was featured in many English newspapers such as the Birmingham Post, the Oxford Mail and the Cambridge Daily News.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 305 \\"In Manchester, Maharishi gave a television interview which reached millions of people in the north of England\\" \\"In Cambridge, the Daily News carried headline: 'Maharishi shows a simple method of meditation', while the Oxford Mail reporter who asked Maharishi ....\\" This was also the year in which the Maharishi trained Henry Nyburg to be the first Transcendental Meditation teacher in Europe.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 302 \\"Maharishi made Henry Nyburg his personal representative for Europe and gave him the training and authority to teach Transcendental Meditation, thus making him the first European teacher.\\"Mason (1994), p. 52 In 1961, the Maharishi visited the United States, Austria, Sweden, France, Italy, Greece, India, Kenya, England, and Canada.Mason (1994), pp. 54‚Äì55 While in England, he appeared on BBC television and gave a lecture to 5,000 people at the Royal Albert Hall in London, organised by Leon MacLaren of the School of Economic Science.Mason (1994), p. 55 In April 1961, the Maharishi conducted his first Transcendental Meditation Teacher Training Course in Rishikesh, India, with sixty participants from various countries.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) pp. 318‚Äì344 From Chapter Titled '1961' pg 328 \\"The following day, BBC Television interviewed Maharishi and chose as the setting for the interview the Acropolis, one of the glories of ancient Greece.\\" \\"On 20 April Maharishi inaugurated...

In Britain, he founded a branch of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement. The year concluded in California where the Maharishi began dictating his book The Science of Being and Art of Living.Mason (1994), p. 62Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) pp. 490‚Äì491 and 503: \\"And in the final days of 1962, in the silent surroundings of Lake Arrowhead, California, Maharishi brought out yet another gift for the world ‚Äì The Science of Being and Art of Living ‚Äì a treasury of pure knowledge to guide mankind in its evolution to perfection.\\" In Rishikesh, India, beginning on 20 April 1962, a forty-day course was held for \\"sadhus, sanyasis, and brahmacharis\\" to introduce TM to \\"religious preachers and spiritual masters in India\\".Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 414 \\"Chapter Titled \\"1962\\": On 20 April, Maharishi in the presence of His Holiness Swami Shantanand Saraswati, the Shankaracharya of northern India, inaugurated a special course\\" \\"In the Prospectus, this special 40-day course was announced for 'sadhus, sannyasis and brahmacharis, and retired persons of energetic calibre'.\\" The Maharishi toured cities in Europe, Asia, North America and India in 1963, and also addressed ministers of the Indian Parliament.Mason (1994), pp. 66‚Äì67Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) pp. 544‚Äì545 \\"Twenty one members of the parliament, representing each of the Indian states, issued a statement entitled a 'timely Call to the Leaders of Today and Tomorrow' for the speedy introduction of the system [of TM] into the daily routine of national life.\\" NOTE: the text of the 3-page statement from the parliament is also included in the book on pages 504‚Äì507 According to his memoirs, twenty-one members of parliament then issued a public statement endorsing the Maharishi's goals and meditation technique.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 504-507 \\"Twenty one members of parliament, representing each of the Indian states, issued a statement entitled a 'timely Call to the Leaders of Today and Tomorrow' for the speedy introduction of the system [of TM] into the daily routine of national life.\\" NOTE: the text of the 3-page statement from the parliament is also included in the book on pages 504‚Äì507 His Canadian tourMason (1994), p. 69 was also well covered by the press.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 530-536 \\"Tributes were later printed in the Canadian magazine, Enjoy\\"--\\"A front page news article in the local Daily Colonist newspaper\\" \\"The Calgary Herald reported an entertaining incident, which took place during an interview in Maharishi's hotel room\\". \\"The Albertan newspaper of Wednesday, 25 September quoted Maharishi as saying that there were now 1,000 TM meditators in Canada.\\" The Maharishi's fifth world tour, in 1964, consisted of visits to many cities in North America, Europe and India.Mason (1994), pp. 71‚Äì75Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) pp 587‚Äì588 \\"On his fifth world tour, Maharishi conducted a Meditation Guides Course in Norway, a course in London, where advanced techniques of TM were given for the first time, and Meditation Guides Courses in Austria, Canada, and Germany/\\" During his visit to England, he appeared with the Abbot of Downside, Abbot Butler, on a BBC television show called The Viewpoint.Mason (1994), p. 72Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 553 \\"But the highlight of this London visit was the popular BBC television interview with Robert Kee, featuring Maharishi and the Abbot of Downside, Abbot Butler.\\" In October of that year, in California, the Maharishi began teaching the first Advanced Technique of Transcendental Meditation to some experienced meditators.Mason (1994), p. 75Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 572 \\"On his fifth world tour, Maharishi conducted a Meditation Guides Course in Norway, a course in London, where advanced techniques of TM were given for the first time, and Meditation Guides Courses in Austria, Canada, and Germany\\" While travelling in America, the Maharishi met with Robert Maynard Hutchins, the head of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, and U Thant, the Secretary General of the United Nations.Mason (1994), p. 79Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) pp 576‚Äì577 \\"On the 17th Maharishi went to Santa Barbara to meet with Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, head of the Centre for Democratic Studies. Maharishi left for NYC on 19 December to meet with U Thant, Secretary General of the United Nations.\\" During this same year, the Maharishi finished his book The Science of Being and Art of Living, which sold more than a million copies and was published in fifteen languages. The Maharishi‚Äôs activities in 1966 included a course in India and a one-month tour in South America. He established Transcendental Meditation centers in Port of Spain, Trinidad; Caracas, Venezuela; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Porto Alegre, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Lima, Peru; and Bogota, Colombia. In addition, in 1966 the Maharishi founded the Students' International Meditation Society (\\"SIMS\\"), which The Los Angeles Times later characterised as a \\"phenomenal success\\". In the 1970s, SIMS centres were established at \\"over one thousand campuses\\",Olson, Carl (1 January 2005) Transcendental Meditation, Encyclopedia of Religion including Harvard University, Yale University, and UCLA. In 1967, the Maharishi gave a lecture at Caxton Hall in London which was attended by Leon MacLaren, the founder and leader of the School of Economic Science (SES). He also lectured at UCLA, Harvard, Yale and Berkeley.Bainbridge, William Sims (1997 Routledge, The Sociology of Religious Movements, page 188 That year, an article in Time magazine reported that the Maharishi \\"has been sharply criticised by other Indian sages, who complain that his programme for spiritual peace without either penance or asceticism contravenes every traditional Hindu belief\\". Religion and culture scholar Sean McCloud also reported that traditional Indian sages and gurus were critical of the Maharishi, for teaching a simple technique and making it available to everyone, and for abandoning traditional concepts of suffering and concentration as paths to enlightenment. At the end of 1968, the Maharishi said that after ten years of teaching and world tours, he would return to India. =Association with the Beatles= In 1967, the Maharishi's fame increased and his movement gained greater prominence when he became the \\"spiritual advisor to the Beatles\\", though he was already well known among young people in the UK and had already had numerous public appearances that brought him to the band's attention.Humes, p. 64 Following the Beatles' endorsement of TM, during 1967 and 1968 the Maharishi appeared on American magazine covers such as Life, Newsweek, Time and many others. He gave lectures to capacity crowds at the Felt Forum in New York City and Harvard's Sanders Hall. He also appeared on The Tonight Show and the Today TV shows. He and the Beatles met in London in August 1967, when George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd urged their friends to attend the Maharishi's lecture at the Hilton on Park Lane. The band members went to study with the Maharishi in Bangor, Wales, before travelling to Rishikesh, India, in February 1968 to \\"devote themselves fully to his instruction\\". Ringo Starr and his wife Maureen left after ten days, Paul McCartney and Jane Asher left after five weeks; the group's most dedicated students, Harrison and John Lennon, departed with their wives sixteen days later. During their stay, the Beatles heard that the Maharishi had allegedly made sexual advances towards Mia Farrow. On 15 June 1968, in London, the Beatles formally renounced their association with the Maharishi as a \\"public mistake\\". \\"Sexy Sadie\\" is the title of a song Lennon wrote in response to the episode. Lennon originally wanted to title the song \\"Maharishi\\", but changed the title at Harrison's request. Harrison commented years later, \\"Now, historically, there's the story that something went on that shouldn't have done ‚Äì but nothing did.\\" In 1992, Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party, and later apologised for the way the Maharishi had been treated by saying, \\"We were very young\\" and \\"It's probably in the history books that Maharishi 'tried to attack Mia Farrow' ‚Äì but it's bullshit, total bullshit.\\" Cynthia Lennon wrote in 2006 that she \\"hated leaving on a note of discord and mistrust, when we had enjoyed so much kindness from the Maharishi\\". Asked if he forgave the Beatles, the Maharishi replied, \\"I could never be upset with angels.\\" McCartney took his daughter, Stella, to visit the Maharishi in the Netherlands in 2007, which renewed their friendship. The New York Times and The Independent reported that the influence of the Maharishi, and the journey to Rishikesh to meditate, steered the Beatles away from LSD and inspired them to write many new songs. In 2009, McCartney commented that Transcendental Meditation was a gift the Beatles had received from the Maharishi at a time when they were looking for something to stabilise them. The Beatles' visit to the Maharishi's ashram coincided with a thirty-participant Transcendental Meditation teacher training course that was ongoing when they arrived. Graduates of the course included Prudence Farrow and Mike Love.Russell, pp. 26‚Äì30 Although the Rishikesh ashram had thrived in its early days it was eventually abandoned in 2001. By 2016, some of it had been reclaimed with building repairs, cleared paths, a small photo museum, murals, a cafe and charges for visitors although the site remains essentially a ruin. =Further growth of the TM movement (1968‚Äì1990)= The Maharishi's headquarters in Seelisberg, Switzerland In 1968, the Maharishi announced that he would stop his public activities and instead begin the training of TM teachers at his new global headquarters in Seelisberg, Switzerland. In 1969, he inaugurated a course in his Science of Creative Intelligence at Stanford University, which was then offered at 25 other American universities. In 1970, the Maharishi held a TM teacher training course at a Victorian hotel in Poland Springs, Maine, with 1,200 participants. Later that year, he held a similar four-week course with 1500 participants at Humboldt State College in Arcata, California. In 1970, after having trouble with Indian tax authorities, he moved his headquarters to Italy, returning to India in the late 1970s. That same year, the City of Hope Foundation in Los Angeles gave the Maharishi their \\"Man of Hope\\" award.Goldhaber, Nat, Denniston, Denise, McWilliams, Peter, (1976). TM: an alphabetical guide to the transcendental meditation program, p. 109. Ballantine, New York. Note: \\"It was in honor of his great contribution to humankind that Maharishi was named Man of Hope in 1970 by the City of Hope Foundation in Los Angeles\\". By 1971, the Maharishi had completed 13 world tours, visited 50 countries, and held a press conference with American inventor Buckminster Fuller at his first International Symposium on SCI at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts.Williamson, p. 92Walcott, James (15 September 2010) Beam Me Up, Bucky. Vanity Fair From 1970 to 1973, about 10,000 people attended the Maharishi sponsored symposia on his modern interpretation of Vedanta philosophy called Science of Creative Intelligence. During these conferences, held at universities, the Maharishi spoke with \\"leading thinkers\\" of the day such as Hans Selye, Marshall McLuhan, and Jonas Salk. The Maharishi announced his World Plan in 1972, the goal of which was to establish 3,600 TM centres around the world. That year, a TM training course was given by the Maharishi at Queen's University and was attended by 1,000 young people from the USA and Canada. At the start of the course, the Maharishi encouraged the attendees to improve their appearance by getting haircuts and wearing ties. He also persuaded the U.S. Army to offer courses in TM to its soldiers and made videotaped recordings of what was thought to be the West's first comprehensive recitation of the Rig Veda.Stark, Rodney and Bainbridge, William Sims (1985), The Future of Religion, University of California Press. p. 288. In March 1973, the Maharishi addressed the legislature of the state of Illinois. That same year, the legislature passed a resolution in support of the use of Maharishi's Science of Creative Intelligence in Illinois public schools.\\"People\\", Anchorage Daily News, 14 March 1973.

Later that year he organized a world conference of mayors in Switzerland. In that same year, he also addressed 3000 educators at an American Association of Higher Education (AAHE) conference on quality of life and higher education. In 1974, the Maharishi International University was founded. In October 1975, the Maharishi was pictured on the front cover of Time magazine. He made his last visit to the Spiritual Regeneration Movement centre in Los Angeles in 1975, according to film director David Lynch, who met him for the first time there. In 1975, the Maharishi embarked on a five- continent trip to inaugurate what he called \\"the Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment\\". The Maharishi said the purpose of the inaugural tour was to \\"go around the country and give a gentle whisper to the population\\". He visited Ottawa during this tour and had a private meeting with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, during which he spoke about the principles of TM and \\"the possibility of structuring an ideal society\\".\\"Maharishi says Trudeau 'Receptive'\\", Canadian Press, The Windsor Star, 22 March 1975.

At that time, the Maharishi also began approaching the business community via an organisation called the American Foundation for SCI (AFSCI), whose objective was to eliminate stress for business professionals. His TM movement came to be increasingly structured along the lines of a multinational corporation. The teaching of TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence in a New Jersey public school was stopped when a US court, in 1977, declared the movement to be religious, and ruled adoption of TM by public organisations in breach of the separation of church and state (First Amendment). During the 1980s, the organisation continued to expand and his meditation technique continued to attract celebrities despite its \\"outlandish claims\\" and accusations of fraud from disaffected former disciples. The TM organization made a number of property investments, buying a former Rothschild mansion in England, Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire, Roydon Hall in Maidstone, Swythamley Park in the Peak District, and a Georgian rectory in Suffolk. In the United States, resorts and hotels, many in city centres, were purchased to be used as TM training centres. Doug Henning and the Maharishi planned a magical Vedic amusement park, Vedaland, and bought large tracts of land near Orlando, Florida, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, to host the park. The theme park was supposed to be a gateway into understanding the mysteries of the universe. According to the Maharishi's official Vedic city website, \\"Entering Veda Land through a secret cave on a windswept plateau high in the Himalayas the adventure starts as one travels through a waterfall that leads to a forest where an ancient Vedic civilization awaits to reveal the deepest secrets of the universe (sic)\\". These plans were never executed and, for Niagara Falls, Veda Land turned out to be just another theme park proposal that never materialized, joining an eclectic list that includes the Worlds of Jules Verne, the Ancient Chinese City and even Canada's Wonderland when it was first being planned.Ricciuto, Tony (8 February 2008) A dreamland by the QEW. Niagara Falls Review The Maharishi commissioned plans from a prominent architect for the world's tallest building, a Vedic-style pyramid to be built in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, and to be filled with Yogic Flyers and other TM endeavours. The Maharishi founded Maharishi Ved Vigyan Vishwa Vidyapeetham, a self-described educational institution located in Uttar Pradesh, India, in 1982. The institution reports that it has trained 50,000 pundits in traditional Vedic recitation.Unknown author E-Gyan web site accessed 9 March 2013Unknown author MVVVP Maharishi India web site accessed 9 March 2013 In 1983, the Maharishi invited government leaders to interact with his organization called \\"World Government\\". In January 1988, offices at the Maharishinagar complex in New Delhi were raided by Indian tax authorities and the Maharishi and his organisation were accused of falsifying expenses. Reports on the value of stocks, fixed-deposit notes, cash and jewels confiscated, vary from source to source. The Maharishi, who was \\"headquartered in Switzerland\\" at the time, reportedly moved to the Netherlands \\"after the Indian government accused him of tax fraud\\".) Following an earthquake in Armenia, the Maharishi trained Russian TM teachers and set up a Maharishi Ayurveda training centre in the Urals region.Borden, Charles W. (8 Jul 2010) \\"Transcendental Meditation in Russia\\". Passport Magazine Beginning in 1989, the Maharishi's movement began incorporating the term \\"Maharishi\\" into the names of their new and existing entities, concepts and programmes.Mason (1994), pp. 272‚Äì273 =Years in Vlodrop (1991‚Äì2008)= The Maharishi's headquarters in MERU, The Netherlands In 1990, the Maharishi relocated his headquarters from Seelisberg, Switzerland, to a former Franciscan monastery in Vlodrop, the Netherlands, which became known as MERU, Holland, on account of the Maharishi European Research University (MERU) campus there. During his time in Vlodrop, he communicated to the public mainly via video and the internet. He also created a subscription-based, satellite TV channel, called Veda Vision, which broadcast content in 22 languages and 144 countries. In 1991, the Maharishi called Washington D.C. a \\"pool of mud\\" after a decade of attempts to lower the rate of crime in the city, which had the second-largest TM community in the US. He told his followers to leave and save themselves from its \\"criminal atmosphere\\". The Maharishi is believed to have made his final public appearance in 1991, in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Deepak Chopra, described as \\"one of the Maharishi's top assistants before he launched his own career\\", wrote that the Maharishi collapsed in 1991 with kidney and pancreas failure, that the illness was kept secret by the Maharishi's family and that he tended to Maharishi during a year-long recovery. According to Chopra, the Maharishi accused him, in July 1993, of trying to compete for the position of guru and asked him to stop travelling and writing books, which led to Chopra's decision to leave the movement in January 1994. As part of a world plan for peace, the Maharishi inaugurated the Natural Law Party (NLP) and calling it a \\"natural government\\". His adherents founded the NLP in 1992. It was active in forty-two countries. John Hagelin, the NLP's three-time candidate for U.S. president, denied any formal connection between the Maharishi and the party. According to spokesman Bob Roth, \\"The Maharishi has said the party has to grow to encompass everyone\\". Critics charged that the party was an effort to recruit people for Transcendental Meditation, and that it resembled \\"the political arm of an international corporation\\" more than a \\"home-grown political creation\\". The Indian arm of the NLP, the Ajeya Bharat Party, achieved electoral success, winning one seat in a state assembly in 1998. The Maharishi shut down the political effort in 2004, saying, \\"I had to get into politics to know what is wrong there.\\" In 1992, the Maharishi began to send groups of Yogic Flyers to countries like India, Brazil, China and America in an effort to promote world peace through \\"coherent world consciousness\\". In 1993 and 2003, he decided to raise the fees for learning the TM technique. In 1997 the Maharishi's organization built the largest wooden structure in the Netherlands without using any nails. The building was the Maharishi's residence for the last two decades of his life. In later years, the Maharishi rarely left his two-room quarters in order to preserve his health and energy. He used videoconferencing to communicate with the world and with his advisors. Built to Maharishi Sthapatya Veda architectural standards, the structure, according to the Maharishi, is said to have helped him infuse \\"the light of Total Knowledge\\" into \\"the destiny of the human race\\".Williamson In 2000, the Maharishi founded the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) \\"to create global world peace by unifying all nations in happiness, prosperity, invincibility and perfect health, while supporting the rich diversity of our world family\\". The Maharishi crowned Tony Nader, a physician and MIT-trained neuroscientist, as the king or Maharaja of the GCWP in 2000. The GCWP unsuccessfully attempted to establish a sovereign micronation when it offered US$1.3 billion to the President of Suriname for a 200-year lease of of land and in 2002, attempted to choose a king for the Talamanca, a \\"remote Indian reservation\\" in Costa Rica. Shorter version at Costa Rica Expels Foreign Group. Orlando Sentinel. 19 July 2002 In 2001, followers of the Maharishi founded Maharishi Vedic City a few miles north of Fairfield, Iowa, in the United States. This new city requires that the construction of its homes and buildings be done according to the Maharishi Sthapatya Veda principles of \\"harmony with nature\\". The Maharishi in 2007 In a 2002 appearance on the CNN show, Larry King Live, the first time in twenty- five years that the Maharishi had appeared in the mainstream media, he said \\"Transcendental Meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results\\". It was occasioned by the reissue of the Maharishi's book The Science of Being and Art of Living. That same year, the Maharishi Global Financing Research Foundation issued the \\"Raam\\" as a currency \\"dedicated to financing peace promoting projects\\". In 2003, David Lynch began a fundraising project to raise US$1 billion \\"on behalf of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\\" to build a meditation centre large enough to hold 8,000 skilled practitioners. The Maharishi ordered a suspension of TM training in Britain in 2005 due to his opposition to prime minister Tony Blair's decision to support the Iraq War. The Maharishi said that he did not want to waste the \\"beautiful nectar\\" of TM on a \\"scorpion nation\\". He lifted the ban after Blair's resignation in 2007. During this period, skeptics were critical of some of the Maharishi's programmes, such as a US$10 trillion plan to end poverty through organic farming in poor countries and a US$1 billion plan to use meditation groups to end conflict. =Death= Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, concerned about his health, became increasingly secluded in two rooms of his residence. During this period he rarely had in- person meetings and instead communicated with his followers almost exclusively by closed-circuit television. On 12 January 2008, his ninetieth birthday, the Maharishi declared: \\"It has been my pleasure at the feet of Guru Dev (Brahmananda Saraswati), to take the light of Guru Dev and pass it on in my environment. Now today, I am closing my designed duty to Guru Dev. And I can only say, 'Live long the world in peace, happiness, prosperity, and freedom from suffering.'\\" A week before his death, the Maharishi said that he was \\"stepping down as leader of the TM movement\\" and \\"retreating into silence\\" and that he planned to spend his remaining time studying \\"the ancient Indian texts\\". The Maharishi died peacefully in his sleep of natural causes on 5 February 2008 at his residence in Vlodrop, Netherlands. The cremation and funeral rites were conducted at the Maharishi's Prayagraj ashram in India, overlooking the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.India eNews, Madhusree Chatterjee, 11 February 2008 \\"The Beatles' guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi cremated\\", Krittivas Mukherjee, Reuters, 11 February 2008 The funeral, with state honours, was carried by Sadhana TV station and was presided over by one of the claimants to the seat of Shankaracharya of the North, Swami Vasudevananda Saraswati Maharaj.Williamson, p. 80 Indian officials who attended the funeral included central minister Subodh Kant Sahay; Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Ashok Singhal; and former Uttar Pradesh assembly speaker and state BJP leader Keshri Nath Tripathi, as well as top local officials. Also in attendance were thirty-five rajas of the Global Country of World Peace, one-time disciple Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, and David Lynch. A troop of uniformed policemen lowered their arms in salute. The funeral received its status as a state funeral because the Maharishi was a recognised master in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta founded by Shankara. The Maharishi is survived by a brother and \\"a number of nephews\\". One nephew, Girish Chandra Varma, is chairman of the Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools GroupBrahmachari Girish (Dr Girish Chandra Varma) , accessed 22 April 2013 and a \\"senior functionary of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement in India.\\" Other nephews include Prakash Shrivastav, president of Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools and Anand Shrivastava, chairman of the Maharishi Group. In its obituary, BBC News reported that the Maharishi's master had bequeathed him \\"the task of keeping the tradition of Transcendental Meditation alive\\" and that \\"the Maharishi's commercial mantras drew criticism from stricter Hindus, but his promises of better health, stress relief and spiritual enlightenment drew devotees from all over the world\\". Paul McCartney commented saying that \\"Whilst I am deeply saddened by his passing, my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly for the people of the world and the cause of unity.\\"\\"Beatles pay tribute to late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\\", AFP (7 February 2008) =Legacy= Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on a 2019 stamp of India The Maharishi left a legacy that includes the revival of India's ancient spiritual tradition of meditation, which he made available to everyone. He is considered responsible for the popularisation of meditation in the west,James Dalen, James and Devries, Stephen (2011) Oxford University Press (New York) Integrative Cardiology, The Integrative Approach to Hypertension, Ch. 11, page 237 something he accomplished by teaching Transcendental Meditation worldwide through a highly effective organization of his own development. The Maharishi is also credited with \\"the proposal of the existence of a unique or fourth state of consciousness with a basis in physiology\\" and the application of scientific studies to research on the physiological effects of Transcendental Meditation and the development of higher states of consciousness, areas previously relegated to mysticism.Wagger, Lane (16 June 2011) The prime mover of life , Times of IndiaRosenthal, Norman (2011) Transcendence, Tarcher Books. p. 4. Partly because of this, Newsweek credited him with helping to launch \\"a legitimate new field of neuroscience\\".Begley, Sharon (18 February 2008). \\"His Magical Mystery Tour\\". Newsweek: 18. \\"Whatever you think of the 'White Album', give the Maharishi credit for helping launch what's become a legitimate new field of neuroscience.\\" According to the Times of India his \\"unique and enduring contribution to humankind was his deep understanding of ‚Äì and mechanics of experiencing ‚Äì pure consciousness\\". A memorial building, the Maharishi Smarak, was inaugurated at Prayagraj in February 2013. Philosophy and teaching The Maharishi had come out to teach with the \\"avowed intention\\" to change \\"the course of human history\\". When he first began teaching he had three main aims: to revive the spiritual tradition in India, to show that meditation was for everyone and not just for recluses, and to show that Vedanta is compatible with science.Goldberg, (2010) American Veda, New York, Harmony Books pp154-155. The Maharishi had a message of happiness, writing in 1967 that \\"being happy is of the utmost importance. Success in anything is through happiness. Under all circumstances be happy. Just think of any negativity that comes at you as a raindrop falling into the ocean of your bliss\\". His philosophy featured the concept that \\"within everyone is an unlimited reservoir of energy, intelligence, and happiness\\". He emphasised the naturalness of his meditation technique as a simple way of developing this potential. Beginning in 1962, the Maharishi began to recommend the daily practice of yoga exercises or asanas to further accelerate growth.Mason (1994), p. 59 He also taught that practising Transcendental Meditation twice a day would create inner peace and that \\"mass meditation sessions\\" could create outer peace by reducing violence and war. According to a TM website, the performance of yagyas by 7,000 pandits in India, plus hundreds of Yogic Flyers in Germany, brought \\"coherence and unity in the collective consciousness of Germany\\" and caused the fall of the Berlin Wall. One religion scholar, Michael York, considers the Maharishi to have been the most articulate spokesman for the spiritual argument that a critical mass of people becoming enlightened through the practice of \\"meditation and yogic discipline\\" will trigger the New Age movement's hoped-for period of postmillennial \\"peace, harmony, and collective consciousness\\". Religious studies scholar Carl Olson writes that the TM technique was based on \\"a neo-Vedanta metaphysical philosophy in which an unchanging reality is opposed to an ever-changing phenomenal world\\" and that the Maharishi says it is not necessary to renounce worldly activities to gain enlightenment, unlike other ascetic traditions. According to author Jack Forem, the Maharishi stated that the experience of transcendence, which resulted in a naturally increasing refinement of mind and body, enabled people to naturally behave in more correct ways. Thus, behavioral guidelines did not need to be issued, and were best left to the teachings of various religions: \\"It is much easier to raise a man's consciousness than to get him to act righteously\\" the Maharishi said. Some religious studies scholars have further said that Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is one of a number of Indian gurus who brought neo-Hindu adaptations of Vedantic Hinduism to the west. Author Meera Nanda calls neo-Hinduism \\"the brand of Hinduism that is taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Deepak Chopra, and their clones\\". J. R. Coplin, a sociologist and MIU graduate, says that the Maharishi saw his own purpose as \\"the 'revival' of the knowledge of an integrated life based upon Vedic principles and Vedantist reality\\". Author Barry Miles writes that, in spite of the media's scepticism for the Maharishi's spiritual message, they seized upon him because young people seemed to listen to his pro-establishment, anti-drug message with one TM participant saying the Maharishi \\"signaled the beginning of the post-acid generation\\". =Transcendental Meditation= During a CNN interview in 2002, the Maharishi said \\"Transcendental meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results\\". His movement offered in-residence style TM advanced courses. By the time of his death, there were nearly 1,000 TM training centres around the world. The Maharishi is credited as having contributed to the western world a meditation technique that is both simple and systematic as well as introducing the scientific study of meditation. In the mid 1970s, the Maharishi began the TM-Sidhi programme, which included Yogic Flying, as an additional option for those who had been practising the Transcendental Meditation technique for some time. According to Coplin, this new aspect of knowledge emphasised not only the individual, but also the collective benefits created by group practice of this advanced programme.Coplin, p. 71 This new programme gave rise to a new principle called the Maharishi Effect, which is said to \\"create coherence in the collective consciousness\\" and to suppress crime, violence, and accidents. =Maharishi Vedic Science= Entrance to the Maharishi University of Management and Maharishi Vedic University campus in Vlodrop, the Netherlands Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) is based on the Maharishi's interpretation of the ancient Vedic texts based on his master, Brahmananda Saraswati's teachings.Humes, p. 66 MVS aims to put forward traditional Vedic literature in the light of Western traditions of knowledge and understanding. According to Roy Ascott, MVS also explains the potential for every human being to experience the infinite nature of transcendental consciousness, also defined as Being or Self, while engaged in normal activities of daily life. Once this state is fully established an individual is no longer influenced by outer aspects of existence and perceives pure consciousness in everything. MVS includes two aspects, the practical aspect of the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi programme, as well as the theoretical aspect of how MVS is applied to day to day living. These applications include programmes in: Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health (MVAH); Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, a mathematical system for the design and construction of buildings; Welvaert, Brandy, \\"Vedic homes seek better living through architecture\\", Rock Island Argus, (5 August 2005) Maharishi Gandharva Veda,Wallace, pp. 99‚Äì102 a form of classical Indian music; Maharishi Jyotish (also known as Maharishi Vedic Astrology),Wallace, pp. 107‚Äì109 a system claiming the evaluation of life tendencies of an individual; Maharishi Vedic Agriculture, a trademarked process for producing fresh, organic food; and Consciousness-Based Education. According to educator James Grant, a former Maharishi University of Management Associate Professor of Education and the former Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Maharishi brought out a \\"full revival of the Vedic tradition of knowledge from India\\" and demonstrated its relevance in many areas including education, business, medicine and government. =Publications= The Maharishi wrote more than twenty books on the Transcendental Meditation technique and Maharishi Vedic Science. The Beacon Light of the Himalayas In 1955, the organisers of the Great Spiritual Development Conference of Kerala published The Beacon Light of the Himalayas, a transcribed 170-page \\"souvenir\\" of the conference. Authors Chryssides, Humes and Forsthoefel, Miller, and Russel cite this as the Maharishi's first published book on Transcendental Meditation, although Transcendental Meditation is not mentioned in the text of the book.Humes, p. 77Russell, p. 75 The book is dedicated to Maharshi Bala Brahmachari Mahesh Yogi Rajaram by his devotees of Kerala and contains photographs, letters and lectures by numerous authors which appear in various languages such as English, Hindi and Sanskrit. Science of Being and Art of Living In 1963, the Maharishi audiotaped the text of the book Science of Being and Art of Living, which was later transcribed and published in fifteen languages.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 459, \\"There was not much time for writing a book, so Maharishi said, 'I'll speak it out on tape, and then you'll get it printed'.\\" K.T. Weidmann describes the book as the Maharishi's fundamental philosophical treatise, one in which its author provides an illustration of the ancient Vedic traditions of India in terms that can be easily interpreted and understood by the scientific thinking of the western world. In the Science of Being, the Maharishi illustrates the concepts of relative existence as the experience of everyday reality through one's senses, and absolute reality as the origin of being, and the source of all creative intelligence. The Maharishi describes this absolute reality, or Being, as unchanging, omnipresent, and eternal. He also identifies it with bliss consciousness. The two aspects of reality, the relative and the absolute, are like an ocean with many waves. The waves represent the relative, and the ocean beneath is the foundation of everything, or Being. Establishing oneself in the field of Being, or unchanging reality, ensures stability. In his Science of Being the Maharishi introduced an additional concept: that of fulfillment viewed as something to be obtained not through exertion or self effort, but through the progressive settling of the mind during the practice of TM. This was the first full systematic description of the principles underlying the Maharishi's teachings. Bhagavad-Gita: A New Translation and Commentary: 1967 In his 1967 publication, Bhagavad-Gita: A New Translation and Commentary, the Maharishi describes the Bhagavad Gita as \\"the Scripture of Yoga\\". He says that \\"its purpose is to explain in theory and practice all that is needed to raise the consciousness of man to the highest possible level.\\" According to Peter Russell, the Bhagavad-Gita deals with the concept of loss of knowledge and subsequent revival, and this is brought out by the Maharishi himself in the introduction.Russell, p. 134 In the Preface, the Maharishi writes: \\"The purpose of this commentary is to restore the fundamental truths of the Bhagavad-Gita and thus restore the significance of its teaching. If this teaching is followed, effectiveness in life will be achieved, men will be fulfilled on all levels and the historical need of the age will be fulfilled also.\\"Yogi, Maharishi Mahesh (1969) page 17 A second concept, that of freedom, presented as the antithesis of fear, is also prevalent in the book, according to Jack Forem.Forem, p. 274 (2012) Forem states that in his interpretation of the Gita, the Maharishi expressed several times that as man gains greater awareness through the practice of Transcendental Meditation, he gradually establishes a level of contentment which remain increasingly grounded within him and in which the mind does not waver and is not affected by either attachment or fear.Forem, p. 275 (2012) Characterizations The Maharishi was reported to be a vegetarian, an entrepreneur, a monk and \\"a spiritual man who sought a world stage from which to espouse the joys of inner happiness\\". He was described as an abstemious man with tremendous energy who took a weekly day of silence while sleeping only two hours per night. He did not present himself as a guru or claim his teachings as his own. Instead he taught \\"in the name of his guru Brahmananda Saraswati\\" and paid tribute to him by placing a picture of Saraswati behind him when he spoke. He was on a mission to bring the ancient techniques of TM to the world. Scientist and futurist Buckminster Fuller spent two days with the Maharishi at a symposium at the University of Massachusetts in 1971 and said, \\"You could not meet with Maharishi without recognizing instantly his integrity.\\"Mason (1994), p. 221: \\"What makes Maharishi beloved and understood is that he has manifest love. You could not meet with Maharishi without recognizing instantly his integrity. You look in his eyes and there it is.\\" Authors Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley write that the Maharishi did not claim any \\"special divine revelation nor supernatural personal qualities\\". Still others said he helped to \\"inspire the anti-materialism of the late 60s\\" and received good publicity because he \\"opposed drugs\\". According to author Chryssides, \\"The Maharishi tended to emphasize the positive aspects of humanity, focusing on the good that exists in everyone.\\" According to The Times the Maharishi attracted scepticism because of his involvement with wealthy celebrities, his business acumen, and his love of luxury, including touring in a Rolls-Royce. A reporter for The Economist calls this a \\"misconception\\" saying: \\"He did not use his money for sinister ends. He neither drank, nor smoked, nor took drugs. ... He did not accumulate scores of Rolls-Royces, like Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh; his biggest self-indulgence was a helicopter. \\"Mason (1994), p. 221: \\"Other popular misconceptions are that he amassed a huge fleet of Rolls Royce cars and private aeroplanes, but, people easily confuse him with other Indian teachers, such as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and Guru Maharaj Ji.\\" When some observers questioned how his organisation's money was being used, the Maharishi said, \\"It goes to support the centres, it does not go on me. I have nothing.\\"Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Guru of transcendental meditation who used his association with the Beatles to create a hugely profitable global movement , The Times, 7 February 2008 He was often referred to as the \\"Giggling Guru\\" because of his habit of laughing during television interviews. Diminutive at a little over five feet tall, the Maharishi often wore a traditional cotton or silk, white dhoti while carrying or wearing flowers. He often sat cross-legged on a deerskin and had a \\"grayish-white beard, mustache and long, dark, stringy hair\\". Barry Miles described the Maharishi as having \\"liquid eyes, twinkling but inscrutable with the wisdom from the East\\". Miles said the Maharishi in his seventies looked much younger than his age. He had a high pitched voice and in the words of Merv Griffin, \\"a long flowing beard and a distinctive, high pitched laugh that I loved to provoke\\". Biographer Paul Mason's web site says that Swami Swaroopananda, one of three claimants to the title Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, is \\"an outspoken critic\\" of the Maharishi. According to Swaroopananda, the Maharishi \\"was responsible for the controversy over Shankaracharyas\\" because he gave Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand encouragement and assistance in fighting the court case which challenged Shantanand's inheritance of the title.Mason, Paul. The Last Instruction, paulmason.info In a review of the documentary film David Wants to Fly, Variety magazine reported Swaroopananda's assertion that \\"as a member of the trader class\\" the Maharishi \\"has no right to give mantras or teach meditation\\". [Swami Swaroopanand, successor to Guru Dev, in a village near Tibet. The swami tells Sieveking that the Maharishi, from a trader caste, was merely Guru Dev's bookkeeper and. Besides, he notes, \\"Gurus don't sell their knowledge, they share it.\\"] According to religious scholar Cynthia Humes, enlightened individuals of any caste may \\"teach brahmavidya\\"Humes, p. 57 and author Patricia Drake writes that \\"when Guru Dev was about to die he charged Maharishi with teaching laymen ... to meditate\\".Drake, Patricia Hemingway(1975) The Transcendental Meditation Primer. David Mckay Company. p. 17. Mason says Shantanand \\"publicly commended the practice of the Maharishi's meditation\\"Mason (1994), p. 57: \\"On Tuesday, 30 May 1961, eight years to the day after his master's death, the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, Swami Shantanand Saraswati graced the teacher training course with his presence and was received with all due ceremony. Arriving at the site where the new Academy was being built, he addressed the Maharishi and the gathered meditators . . . . He commended the practice of the Maharishi's meditation, describing it as a 'master key to the knowledge of Vedanta' and added, 'There are other keys, but a master key is enough to open all the locks.'\\" and sociologist J.R. Coplin says that Shantanand's successor, Swami Vishnudevanand, also \\"speaks highly of the Maharishi\\".Coplin, pp. 61‚Äì63: \\"Maharishi, though a devoted and favored disciple, was not eligible to become Shankarachaharya due to his caste background (non-brahmin). Nonetheless, he shares with the last two Shankaracharyas of Jyotir Math (who succeeded Brahmanand Saraswati) a brotherly relationship, known as \\"guru-bhais\\". Even today, Swami Vishnudevanand (the current Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math) speaks very highly of Maharishi and sees his teaching as a reflection of their master's. Both he and Swami Shantanand (his immediate predecessor) are frequent guests of Maharishi's both in India and abroad, personally endorsing his mission.\\".... \\"When Maharishi began teaching during his South Indian tour in the mid-1950s, he arrived as an informal representative of the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, being a 'great disciple of Shri Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (former Shankaracharya)'\\". While the Beatles were in Rishikesh allegations of sexual improprieties by the Maharishi in his ashram were circulated but participants later denied them and no law suits were ever filed. =Popular culture= The British satirical magazine Private Eye ridiculed him as \\"Veririchi Lotsamoney Yogi Bear\\". The Maharishi was also parodied by comedians Bill Dana and Joey Forman in the 1968 comedy album The Mashuganishi Yogi, by comedian Mike Myers in the film The Love Guru, and in the BBC sketch show Goodness Gracious Me.Dunphy, Grahme & Emiq, Rainer, Rodopi (2009) Hybrid Humor: Comedy in Transnational Perspectives. p. 184. He was portrayed by actor Gerry Bednob in the 2007 film Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. He was also the subject of the Beatles' song Sexy Sadie. In an episode of the popular BBC Radio 4 fictional comedy show Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge a comment is made about Yogi when Partridge is interviewing a spiritual man comparing him to Buddha, Dalai Lama, Uri Geller and \\"that man The Beatles went to see...\\" Other initiatives, projects and programmes Maharishi International University (renamed Maharishi University of Management (MUM) in 1995), the first university the Maharishi founded, began classes in Santa Barbara, California, in 1973. In 1974 the university moved to Fairfield, Iowa, where it remains today. The university houses a library of the Maharishi's taped lectures and writings, including the thirty-three-lesson Science of Creative Intelligence course, originally a series of lectures given by the Maharishi in Fiuggi, Italy, in 1972. Described in the MUM university catalogue as combining modern science and Vedic science,MUM Catalog of courses 2012‚Äì2013 (Page 23) the course also defines certain higher states of consciousness, and gives guidance on how to attain these states. Though the university claims to grant PhDs, including in neuroscience and psychology, the university is not accredited by either the America Psychological Association (APA) or the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. MCEE School Campus at Bhopal, India The Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools (MVMS), an educational system established in sixteen Indian states and affiliated with the New Delhi Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), was founded in 1995 by the Maharishi. It has 148 branches in 118 cities with 90,000 to 100,000 students and 5,500 teaching and support staff. In 1998, Maharishi Open University was founded by the Maharishi. It was accessible via a network of eight satellites broadcasting to every country in the world, and via the Internet. The Maharishi also introduced theories of management, defence, and government programmes designed to alleviate poverty, and introduced a new economic development currency called the Raam. In 2000, the Maharishi began building administrative and teaching centres called \\"Peace Palaces\\" around the world, and by 2008 at least eight had been constructed in the US alone. The Maharishi Institute, an African university that is part of a group of schools around the world that are named after him, was founded in 2007 and uses his Transcendental Meditation technique in their teaching.About the Institute. Maharishi InstituteAnderson, Alistair (26 March 2012) \\"CIDA Institute may become, self funded university\\", Business Day Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in his farewell message on 11 January 2008, announced the establishment of the Brahmananda Saraswati Trust (BST), named in honour of his teacher, to support large groups totalling more than 30,000 peace-creating Vedic Pandits in perpetuity across India. The Patron of the Brahmanand Saraswati Trust is the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math. =Organizations and businesses= The Maharishi is credited with heading charitable organisations, for-profit businesses, and real estate investments whose total value has been estimated at various times, to range from 2 to 5 billion. The real estate alone was valued in 2003 at between $3.6 and $5 billion. Holdings in the United States, estimated at $250 million in 2008, include dozens of hotels, commercial buildings and undeveloped land. The Maharishi \\"amassed a personal fortune that his spokesman told one reporter may exceed $1 billion\\". According to a 2008 article in The Times, the Maharishi \\"was reported to have an income of six million pounds\\". The Maharishi's movement is said to be funded through donations, course fees for Transcendental Meditation and various real estate transactions.Aspan, Maria (2 July 2007), Maharishi's Minions Come to Wall Street, NY Times In his biography of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, The Story of the Maharishi (published 1976), William Jefferson suggests that the financial aspect of the TM organisation was one of the greatest controversies it faced. Questions were raised about the Maharishi's mission, comments from leaders of the movement at that time, and fees and charges the TM organisation levied on followers. Jefferson says that the concerns with money came from journalists more than those who have learned to meditate.

Seafloor features larger than 10 km are detected by resulting gravitational distortion of sea surface. (1995, NOAA) Physical geodesy is the study of the physical properties of the gravity field of the Earth, the geopotential, with a view to their application in geodesy. Measurement procedure Traditional geodetic instruments such as theodolites rely on the gravity field for orienting their vertical axis along the local plumb line or local vertical direction with the aid of a spirit level. After that, vertical angles (zenith angles or, alternatively, elevation angles) are obtained with respect to this local vertical, and horizontal angles in the plane of the local horizon, perpendicular to the vertical. Levelling instruments again are used to obtain geopotential differences between points on the Earth's surface. These can then be expressed as \\"height\\" differences by conversion to metric units.  The geopotential  The Earth's gravity field can be described by a potential as follows: : \\\\mathbf{g} = abla W = \\\\mathrm{grad}\\\\ W = \\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial X}\\\\mathbf{i} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial Y}\\\\mathbf{j}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial Z}\\\\mathbf{k} which expresses the gravity acceleration vector as the gradient of W, the potential of gravity. The vector triad \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{i},\\\\mathbf{j},\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\\\\\} is the orthonormal set of base vectors in space, pointing along the X,Y,Z coordinate axes. Note that both gravity and its potential contain a contribution from the centrifugal pseudo-force due to the Earth's rotation. We can write : W = V + \\\\Phi\\\\, where V is the potential of the gravitational field, W that of the gravity field, and \\\\Phi that of the centrifugal force field. The centrifugal force -- per unit of mass, i.e., acceleration -- is given by : \\\\mathbf{g}_c = \\\\omega^2 \\\\mathbf{p}, where : \\\\mathbf{p} = X\\\\mathbf{i}+Y\\\\mathbf{j}+0\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{k} is the vector pointing to the point considered straight from the Earth's rotational axis. It can be shown that this pseudo-force field, in a reference frame co-rotating with the Earth, has a potential associated with it that looks like this: : \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\omega^2 (X^2+Y^2). This can be verified by taking the gradient ( abla) operator of this expression. Here, X, Y and Z are geocentric coordinates. Units Gravity is commonly measured in units of m¬∑s‚àí2 (metres per second squared). This also can be expressed (multiplying by the gravitational constant G in order to change units) as newtons per kilogram of attracted mass. Potential is expressed as gravity times distance, m2¬∑s‚àí2. Travelling one metre in the direction of a gravity vector of strength 1 m¬∑s‚àí2 will increase your potential by 1 m2¬∑s‚àí2. Again employing G as a multiplier, the units can be changed to joules per kilogram of attracted mass. A more convenient unit is the GPU, or geopotential unit: it equals 10 m2¬∑s‚àí2. This means that travelling one metre in the vertical direction, i.e., the direction of the 9.8 m¬∑s‚àí2 ambient gravity, will approximately change your potential by 1 GPU. Which again means that the difference in geopotential, in GPU, of a point with that of sea level can be used as a rough measure of height \\"above sea level\\" in metres.  The normal potential  To a rough approximation, the Earth is a sphere, or to a much better approximation, an ellipsoid. We can similarly approximate the gravity field of the Earth by a spherically symmetric field: : W \\\\approx \\\\frac{GM}{R} of which the equipotential surfaces‚Äîthe surfaces of constant potential value‚Äîare concentric spheres. It is more accurate to approximate the geopotential by a field that has the Earth reference ellipsoid as one of its equipotential surfaces, however. The most recent Earth reference ellipsoid is GRS80, or Geodetic Reference System 1980, which the Global Positioning system uses as its reference. Its geometric parameters are: semi-major axis a = 6378137.0 m, and flattening f = 1/298.257222101. A geopotential field U is constructed, being the sum of a gravitational potential \\\\Psi and the known centrifugal potential \\\\Phi, that has the GRS80 reference ellipsoid as one of its equipotential surfaces. If we also require that the enclosed mass is equal to the known mass of the Earth (including atmosphere) GM = 3986005 √ó 108 m3¬∑s‚àí2, we obtain for the potential at the reference ellipsoid: : U_0=62636860.850 \\\\ \\\\textrm m^2 \\\\, \\\\textrm s^{-2} Obviously, this value depends on the assumption that the potential goes asymptotically to zero at infinity (R\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty), as is common in physics. For practical purposes it makes more sense to choose the zero point of normal gravity to be that of the reference ellipsoid, and refer the potentials of other points to this.  Disturbing potential and geoid  Once a clean, smooth geopotential field U has been constructed matching the known GRS80 reference ellipsoid with an equipotential surface (we call such a field a normal potential) we can subtract it from the true (measured) potential W of the real Earth. The result is defined as T, the disturbing potential: : T = W-U The disturbing potential T is numerically a great deal smaller than U or W, and captures the detailed, complex variations of the true gravity field of the actually existing Earth from point-to-point, as distinguished from the overall global trend captured by the smooth mathematical ellipsoid of the normal potential. Due to the irregularity of the Earth's true gravity field, the equilibrium figure of sea water, or the geoid, will also be of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid‚Äîmathematical mean sea level‚Äîsticks out as much as 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Ceylon, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the undulation of the geoid, symbol N, and is closely related to the disturbing potential. According to the famous Bruns formula, we have : N=T/\\\\gamma\\\\,, where \\\\gamma is the force of gravity computed from the normal field potential U. In 1849, the mathematician George Gabriel Stokes published the following formula named after him: : N=\\\\frac{R}{4\\\\pi \\\\gamma_0}\\\\iint_\\\\sigma \\\\Delta g \\\\,S(\\\\psi)\\\\, d\\\\sigma. In this formula, \\\\Delta g stands for gravity anomalies, differences between true and normal (reference) gravity, and S is the Stokes function, a kernel function derived by Stokes in closed analytical form. Note that determining N anywhere on Earth by this formula requires \\\\Delta g to be known everywhere on Earth, including oceans, polar areas, and deserts. For terrestrial gravimetric measurements this is a near-impossibility, in spite of close international co-operation within the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), e.g., through the International Gravity Bureau (BGI, Bureau Gravim√©trique International). Another approach is to combine multiple information sources: not just terrestrial gravimetry, but also satellite geodetic data on the figure of the Earth, from analysis of satellite orbital perturbations, and lately from satellite gravity missions such as GOCE and GRACE. In such combination solutions, the low-resolution part of the geoid solution is provided by the satellite data, while a 'tuned' version of the above Stokes equation is used to calculate the high-resolution part, from terrestrial gravimetric data from a neighbourhood of the evaluation point only. The geoid, or mathematical mean sea surface, is defined not only on the seas, but also under land; it is the equilibrium water surface that would result, would sea water be allowed to move freely (e.g., through tunnels) under the land. Technically, an equipotential surface of the true geopotential, chosen to coincide (on average) with mean sea level. As mean sea level is physically realized by tide gauge bench marks on the coasts of different countries and continents, a number of slightly incompatible \\"near- geoids\\" will result, with differences of several decimetres to over one metre between them, due to the dynamic sea surface topography. These are referred to as vertical or height datums. For every point on Earth, the local direction of gravity or vertical direction, materialized with the plumb line, is perpendicular to the geoid. On this is based a method, astrogeodetic levelling, for deriving the local figure of the geoid by measuring deflections of the vertical by astronomical means over an area.  Gravity anomalies  Above we already made use of gravity anomalies \\\\Delta g. These are computed as the differences between true (observed) gravity g=\\\\\\\\vec{g}\\\\, and calculated (normal) gravity \\\\gamma=\\\\\\\\vec{\\\\gamma}\\\\=\\\\ abla U\\\\. (This is an oversimplification; in practice the location in space at which Œ≥ is evaluated will differ slightly from that where g has been measured.) We thus get : \\\\Delta g = g - \\\\gamma.\\\\, These anomalies are called free-air anomalies, and are the ones to be used in the above Stokes equation. In geophysics, these anomalies are often further reduced by removing from them the attraction of the topography, which for a flat, horizontal plate (Bouguer plate) of thickness H is given by : a_B=2\\\\pi G\\\\rho H,\\\\, The Bouguer reduction to be applied as follows: : \\\\Delta g_B = \\\\Delta g_{FA} - a_B,\\\\, so-called Bouguer anomalies. Here, \\\\Delta g_{FA} is our earlier \\\\Delta g, the free-air anomaly. In case the terrain is not a flat plate (the usual case!) we use for H the local terrain height value but apply a further correction called the terrain correction (TC).

Parker was 16 at the time, while Hulme was 15. The murder has inspired plays, novels, non-fiction books, and films including Peter Jackson's 1994 film Heavenly Creatures. Background Pauline Yvonne Parker (aka Pauline Rieper) was born on 26 May 1938. She met Juliet Hulme, who was born in London, when they were both in their early teens. Parker came from a working-class background; while Hulme, who arrived with her parents in New Zealand in 1948, was the daughter of Henry Hulme, a physicist who was the rector of University of Canterbury in Christchurch. They both attended Christchurch Girls' High School, then located in what became the Cranmer Centre. Both girls had debilitating illnesses as children ‚Äì Parker osteomyelitis and Hulme tuberculosis ‚Äì and they initially bonded over it. According to Parker's accounts, she and Hulme both romanticized the idea of being sick. The girls first met at Christchurch Girls' High School where they initially bonded over their respective medical conditions. Later, as their friendship developed, they formed an elaborate fantasy life together. They wrote plays, books, and stories centred in this world. They became nearly obsessed with one another. Pauline's parents, in particular, became concerned that the girls were becoming too close, and that their relationship might be sexual. Homosexuality at the time was considered a serious mental illness. The Hulmes also had concerns, but both families continued to allow the girls to see one another, and Pauline was accepted at the Hulme home in Ilam for overnights and vacations. Juliet became withdrawn and ill when Pauline would leave the Hulme home without her. During their relationship, the girls invented their own personal religion, with their own ideas on morality. They rejected Christianity and worshipped their own saints, envisioning a parallel dimension called The Fourth World, essentially their version of Heaven. The Fourth World was a place that they felt they were already able to enter occasionally, during moments of spiritual enlightenment. By Parker's account, they had achieved this spiritual enlightenment because of their friendship. Pauline was not invited to go to Ilam over the summer holidays in 1953 as she had been in previous years. In 1954, Hulme's parents separated. Problems with faculty and the board forced her father to resign from his position as rector of the university, and her mother was carrying on an affair. The family planned to return to England, but it was decided that Juliet would be sent to live with relatives in South Africa‚Äîostensibly for her health. Both girls were heartbroken over their upcoming separation and decided that Pauline should go to South Africa as well. They thought the Hulmes would agree to this plan, though in fact they were unlikely to allow it. Pauline was sure her mother would not allow her to go with Juliet. The girls then formed a plan to murder Pauline's mother in order to remove the one perceived obstacle of remaining together. Their long term plan was to go to South Africa and then head to Hollywood or New York City, where they believed they would publish their writing and work in film. Murder On the afternoon of 22 June 1954, Honorah had gone for a walk through in Victoria Park, in Christchurch, New Zealand with her daughter Pauline Parker and Pauline's best friend Juliet Hulme. Approximately down the path, in a wooded area of the park near a small wooden bridge, Hulme and Parker bludgeoned Rieper to death with half of a brick enclosed in an old stocking. After committing the murder, which they had planned together, the two girls fled, covered in blood, back to the tea kiosk where the three of them had eaten only minutes before. They were met by Agnes and Kenneth Ritchie, owners of the tea shop, whom they told that Honorah had fallen and hit her head. The body of Honorah Rieper was discovered in Victoria Park by Ritchie. Major lacerations were found about her head, neck, and face, with minor injuries to her fingers. Police soon discovered the murder weapon in the nearby woods. The girls' story of Rieper's accidental death quickly fell apart. Trial and conviction Prior to the trial, Pauline Parker had been known as Pauline Rieper. Her mother, Honorah Rieper, had been living with her father, Herbert Rieper; but during police investigations, it was revealed that they were not, in fact, married. Thus, during the trial, both Honorah and Pauline were referred to with the surname \\"Parker\\".Parker‚ÄìHulme murder case; Star-Sun, 23 August 1954, p.1 The trial was a sensational affair, with speculation about their possible lesbianism and insanity. The girls were convicted on 28 August 1954; and, as they were too young to be considered for the death penalty, each spent five years in prison. Some sources say they were released on condition that they never contact each other again, but Sam Barnett, then Secretary for Justice, told journalists there was no such condition. Hulme's release was unconditional, and she immediately rejoined her father in Italy, while Parker was placed on six months' parole in New Zealand, after which she left the country. Less than four months later, the murder was taken as strong evidence of moral decline by the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents in what became known as the Mazengarb Report, named after its chair, Ossie Mazengarb. Release Following her release from prison, Pauline Parker was given a new identity as Hilary Nathan, and spent some time in New Zealand under close surveillance before being allowed to leave for England. Beginning in 1997, she was living in the small village of Hoo near Strood, Kent, and running a children's riding school. As an adult, she became a devout Roman Catholic. While she has never spoken to the press, in a 1996 statement released through her sister she expressed strong remorse for having killed her mother. Her sister further stated that \\"[Pauline] committed the most terrible crime and has spent 40 years repaying it by keeping away from people and doing her own little thing...After it happened, she was very sorry about it. It took her about five years to realise what she had done.\\" After her release from prison, Juliet Hulme spent time in England and the United States, later settling in England and becoming a successful historical detective novelist under her new name, Anne Perry. She has been a Mormon since about 1968. Until 1994, it was not well known that Perry was Hulme. In March 2006, Hulme/Perry stated that, while her relationship with Pauline Parker was obsessive, they were not lesbians. Media portrayals The story of the murder was adapted into the 1971 French film Mais ne nous d√©livrez pas du mal (Don't Deliver Us From Evil) and into Peter Jackson's film Heavenly Creatures (1994). Perry's identity was revealed publicly around the time of the film's release. The case was also fictionalised in 1958 as The Evil Friendship by M. E. Kerr under the pseudonym Vin Packer. Beryl Bainbridge's first novel, Harriet Said..., was inspired by newspaper reports of the case.Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center Inspired by the case, Angela Carter wrote an unproduced screenplay called The Christchurch Murder in which Pauline Parker was renamed Lena Ball and Juliet Hulme, Nerissa Locke.The Curious Room Carter's screenplay influenced the 1994 Peter Jackson film Heavenly Creatures and was later produced as a play for radio, airing on BBC Radio 4 in September 2018.\\"Get Carter: The Christchurch Murder,\\" adapted for radio by Robin Brooks and produced by Allegra. Premiered on BBC Radio 4 on 22/09/2018. Mary Orr and Reginald Denham's 1967 play Minor Murder, Michaelanne Forster's 1992 New Zealand play Daughters of Heaven and Canadian Trevor Schmidt's 2010 play Folie √† Deux were based on the Parker‚ÄìHulme murder. The case also inspired Evie Wyld's novel All The Birds, Singing. As of 2011, Alexander Roman has completed a documentary called Reflections of the Past, in which Pauline Parker is played by Alice Drewitt. It premiered at Lincoln University (in lieu of Rialto Cinema, which was closed due to the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake) on 9 May.Reflections of the Past at the Internet Movie Database.Reflections of the Past official website. Episode 429 of The Simpsons, \\"Lisa the Drama Queen\\", is also loosely based on Parker and Hulme. The Mystery Woman television film \\"Mystery Weekend\\" strongly bases its story on the Parker-Hulme case. The names are changed and the location of the crime is changed to Halifax. However, the crime itself is kept intact, as is the concept of one of the murderers later becoming a bestselling mystery novelist.

Established in 1919, its central focus is on entrepreneurship education. It was founded by Roger W. Babson as an all-male business institute but is now coeducational.  History  =20th century= On September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills. Roger Babson, the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the Babson Institute from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, finance and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical economics, financial management, business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere. Babson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings. The institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30 a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \\"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\\" In 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time. =21st century= Babson is involved in a three college collaboration with Olin College and Wellesley College (a collaboration often referred to as BOW). Campus =Wellesley Main Campus= The main residential campus of Babson College is and located in the \\"Babson Park\\" section of Wellesley, Massachusetts, just fifteen miles west of Boston. It is adjacent to the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. Undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to take advantage of campus amenities including the student center, the cafeteria, Horn Library, multiple centers and institutes, the Webster fitness center, the Weissman Foundry the arts center, and a new centennial park known as the Kerry Murphy Healey Park. Executive and Enterprise Education visitors have the opportunity to stay in guest rooms adjacent to the meeting center. =Babson Boston= The Babson Boston classroom and event space, located at 100 High Street, gives Babson a presence in downtown Boston and connects the resources of the college with the innovative companies, organizations and leaders in Boston's Financial District. Opened in 2016, this facility provides the opportunity to offer MBA courses in a location convenient to where entrepreneurial students live and work. Over the course of the academic year, there are opportunities at the Boston location for students to engage with Babson offices and resources, including graduate programs, the Graduate Center for Career Development, Graduate Admissions and the college's alumni network. From 2011 to 2016, Babson Boston campus was at 253 Summer Street in Boston's Innovation District. =Babson San Francisco= Babson has a San Francisco campus which includes a Blended Learning MBA program, an undergraduate semester experience and custom executive education. =Babson Miami= In July 2017, President Kerry Healey announced Babson's plans to expand to Miami, Florida, where the Blended Learning MBA, Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) and Certificate in Advanced Management (CAM), three graduate programs are offered.

He is best remembered for founding Babson College. He also founded Webber College, now Webber International University, in Babson Park, Florida, and the defunct Utopia College, in Eureka, Kansas. Babson was born to Nathaniel Babson and his wife Ellen Stearns as part of the 10th generation of Babsons to live in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Roger attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked for investment firms before founding Babson's Statistical Organization (1904), which analyzed stocks and business reports; it continues today as Babson- United, Inc..: A Short History of Roger L. Babson's firm On March 29, 1900, Babson married his first wife Grace Margaret Knight, who died in 1956. In 1957 he remarried to Nona M. Dougherty, who died in 1963. Babson died in 1967. Work on financial theory Babson's success as an investor was based on unorthodox views of the operation of markets. According to biographer John Mulkern, Babson attributed the business cycle \\"to Sir Isaac Newton's law of action and reaction... (with a) pseudoscientific notion that gravity can be used to explain movement in the stock markets.\\" His market forecasting techniques are expounded in articles in Traders World Magazine and the Gravity Research Foundation he founded.http://gravityresearchfoundation.org/pdf/awarded/2005/Jaenisch_Jaenisch_2005.pdf While attending MIT he received a degree in Engineering. He lobbied the dean to include a business course, which resulted in a course known as \\"Business Engineering.\\" Eventually, the business engineering program was expanded and it is now seen as the forerunner of the MBA degree. Babson authored more than 40 books on economic and social problems, the most widely read being Business Barometers (eight editions) and Business Barometers for Profits, Security, Income (10 editions). Babson also wrote hundreds of magazine articles and newspaper columns. He was a popular lecturer on business and financial trends. Babson was an investor and sometimes director of many corporations, including some traded on the New York Stock Exchange. He established the investment advisory company Babson's Reports, which published one of the first investment newsletters in the U.S. =Babson's Ten Commandments of Investing= Babson had \\"Ten Commandments\\" he followed in investing and encouraged his readers to do the same. These were: # Keep speculation and investments separate. # Don't be fooled by a name. # Be wary of new promotions. # Give due consideration to market ability. # Don't buy without proper facts. # Safeguard purchases through diversification. # Don't try to diversify by buying different securities of the same company. # Small companies should be carefully scrutinized. # Buy adequate security, not super abundance. # Choose your dealer and buy outright (don't buy on margin). On September 5, 1929, he gave a speech saying, \\"Sooner or later a crash is coming, and it may be terrific.\\" Later that day the stock market declined by about 3%. This became known as the \\"Babson Break.\\" The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression soon followed. Role in development of Andrews Pitchfork Babson learned to draw a nominal line through zigzagging market action on charts from George F. Swain, a Professor of Engineering, when he worked with him, and he later taught this technique to Alan H. Andrews, who further refined it into \\"Andrews Pitchfork,\\" a now-commonly used trendline indicator. Political career Babson was the Prohibition Party's candidate for President of the United States in 1940. Election was won by incumbent President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the Democratic Party. Babson was surpassed by two other unsuccessful candidates: * Wendell Lewis Willkie of the Republican Party. * Norman Mattoon Thomas of the Socialist Party of America. Role in development of the parking meter In the late 1920s, Babson filed several patents for a parking meter.US patent 1,731,839 The meters were suggested to operate on power from the battery of the parking vehicle and required a connection from the vehicle to the meter. In 1932, Carl Magee began to work on the parking meter and since his parking meter was the first to be installed for actual use on July 1935 in Oklahoma City, Magee is known as the inventor of the parking meter. Establishment of the Gravity Research Foundation Babson founded the Gravity Research Foundation in 1948.Jon Mooallem (2007, October). A curious attraction. Harper's Magazine, 315(1889), pp. 84-91. The Foundation established a research facility in the town of New Boston, New Hampshire after Babson determined that this location was far enough away from the city of Boston, Massachusetts to survive a nuclear attack. The \\"Babson Boulders\\" of Dogtown, Massachusetts Dogtown Babson was interested in the history of an abandoned settlement in Gloucester known as Dogtown. To provide charitable assistance to unemployed stonecutters in Gloucester during the Great Depression, Babson commissioned them to carve inspirational inscriptions on approximately two dozen boulders in the area surrounding Dogtown Common. The Babson Boulder Trail exists today as a well-known hiking and mountain-biking trail. The inscriptions are clearly visible. The boulders are scattered, not all are on the trail, and not all of the inscriptions face it, making finding them something of a challenge.

Babson wanted to put up a sign declaring New Boston to be the safest place in North America if World War III came, but town fathers toned it down to say merely that New Boston was a safe place.New Boston Historical Society history of New Boston, page 113 In an essay titled Gravity - Our Enemy Number One, Babson indicated that his wish to overcome gravity dated from the childhood drowning of his sister. \\"She was unable to fight gravity, which came up and seized her like a dragon and brought her to the bottom,\\" he wrote.See Appendix Intro. 3: Gravity ‚Äì Our Enemy Number One. In Harry Collins (2004). Gravity's Shadow: The Search for Gravitational Waves. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press.

As of 2020, it is still administered out of Wellesley, Massachusetts, by George Rideout, Jr., son of the foundation's original director. Over time, the foundation shed its crankish air, turning its attention from trying to block gravity to trying to understand it. The annual essay prize has drawn respected researchers, including physicist Stephen Hawking, who won in 1971, mathematician/author Roger Penrose (Nobel Prize in Physics, 2020), who won in 1975, and astrophysicist and Nobel laureate George Smoot, who won in 1993.

Hobart College's \\"H-Book\\" contains a description of the circumstances surrounding the placement of its Gravity Monument: \\"The location of the stone on campus was linked to a gift to the Colleges of 'gravity grant' stocks, now totaling more than $1 million, from Roger Babson, the founder of Babson College. The eccentric Babson was intrigued by the notion of anti-gravity and inclined to further scientific research in this area. The Colleges used these funds to help construct Rosenberg Hall in 1994. Two trees that shade the stone are said to be direct descendants of Newton‚Äôs famous apple tree.\\" The stone at Colby College was once in front of the Keyes Building on the main academic quadrangle but was moved to a more obscure location near the Schair-Swenson-Watson Alumni Center. Students would often knock it over in an ironic testament to gravity's power. At Tufts, the monument is the site of an \\"inauguration ceremony\\"Tufts \\"inauguration ceremony' for students who receive Ph.D.s in cosmology, in which a thesis advisor drops an apple on the student's head.

It is located in the London commuter belt, approximately northeast of the centre of London at Charing Cross and approximately from Colchester. The urban area of the city has a population of approximately 112,000, whilst the district has a population of 168,310. The main conurbation of Chelmsford incorporates all or part of the former parishes of Broomfield, Newland Spring, Great Leigh's, The Walthams, Great Baddow, Little Baddow, Galleywood, Howe Green, Margaretting, Pleshey, Stock, Roxwell, Danbury, Writtle, Moulsham, Rettendon, The Hanningfields, The Chignals, Widford and Springfield, including Springfield Barnes, now known as Chelmer Village. The communities of Chelmsford, Massachusetts, Chelmsford, Ontario and Chelmsford, New Brunswick are named after the city. Chelmsford's population consists of a large number of City and Docklands commuters, attracted by the 30‚Äì35-minute journey into Central London via the Great Eastern Main Line railway. The same journey takes at least 60 minutes by road, via the A12. On 14 March 2012, Lord President of the Privy Council and Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, announced that Chelmsford was to be granted city status to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The Letters Patent officially granting city status to Chelmsford were received on 6 June 2012. The demonym for a Chelmsford resident is \\"Chelmsfordian\\". History Chelmsford Cathedral The 18-arch Victorian Railway Viaduct that carries the Great Eastern Main Line through Central Park. =Early history= Before 1199, there were settlements nearby from ancient times. A Neolithic and a late Bronze Age settlement have been found in the Springfield suburb, and the town was occupied by the Romans. A Roman fort was built in AD 60, and a civilian town grew up around it. The town was given the name of Caesaromagus (Caesar's field or Caesar's marketplace), although the reason for it being given the great honour of bearing the Imperial prefix is now unclear ‚Äì possibly as a failed 'planned town' provincial capital to replace Londinium or Camulodunum. The remains of a mansion, a combination post office, civic centre and hotel, lie beneath the streets of modern Moulsham, and the ruins of an octagonal temple are located beneath the Odeon roundabout. The town disappeared for a while after the Romans left Britain. In 1199, following the commissioning of a bridge over the River Can by Maurice, Bishop of London, William of Sainte-M√®re-Eglise was granted a Royal Charter for Chelmsford to hold a market, marking the origin of the modern town. An under- cover market, operating Tuesday to Saturday, is still an important part of the city centre over 800 years later. The city's name is derived from Ceolmaer's ford which was close to the site of the present High Street stone bridge. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the town was called Celmeresfort and by 1189 it had changed to Chelmsford. Its position on the Londinium ‚Äì Camulodonum Roman road (the modern A12) ensured the early prosperity of Chelmsford. The town became the seat of the local assize during the early 13th century (though assizes were also held at Brentwood) and by 1218 it was recognised as the county town of Essex, a position it has retained to the present day. Chelmsford was significantly involved in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, and Richard II moved on to the town after quelling the rebellion in London. 'The Sleepers and The Shadows', written by Hilda Grieve in 1988 using original sources, states: \\"For nearly a week, from Monday 1st July to Saturday 6th July [1381], Chelmsford became the seat of government ... The king probably lodged at his nearby manor house at Writtle. He was attended by his council, headed by the temporary Chancellor ... the new chief justice ... the royal chancery ... Their formidable task in Chelmsford was to draft, engross, date, seal and despatch by messengers riding to the farthest corners of the realm, the daily batches of commissions, mandates, letters, orders and proclamations issued by the government not only to speed the process of pacification of the kingdom, but to conduct much ordinary day-to-day business of the Crown and Government.\\" Richard II famously revoked the charters which he had made in concession to the peasants on 2 July 1381, while in Chelmsford. It could be said that given this movement of government power, Chelmsford for a few days at least became the capital of England. Many of the ringleaders of the revolt were executed on the gallows at what is now Primrose Hill. An Anglo-Saxon burial was discovered at Broomfield to the north of Chelmsford in the late 19th century and the finds are now in the British Museum. The road 'Saxon Way' now marks the site. In the 17th century many of the victims of Matthew Hopkins (the self-styled \\"Witchfinder General\\") spent their last days imprisoned in Chelmsford, before being tried at the Assizes and hanged for witchcraft. Henry VIII purchased the Boleyn estate in 1516, and built Beaulieu Palace on the current site of New Hall School. This later became the residence of his then mistress, and later wife Anne. Soon after it became the residence of Henry's daughter, by his first marriage, Mary I. King Robert I of Scotland, better known as Robert the Bruce, had close ties with the nearby village of Writtle and there is some evidence to suggest he was born at Montpeliers Farm in the village,Robert's absolution for Comyn's murder, in 1310, gives Robert as a layman of Carrick, indicating Carrick / Turnberry was either his primary residence, or place of birth. Lochmaben has a claim, as a possession of the Bruce family, but is not supported by a medieval source. The contemporary claims of Essex / the Bruce estate at Writtle Essex, during the coronation of Edward, have been discounted by G. W. S. Barrow.Geoffrey le Baker's: Chronicon Galfridi le Baker de Swynebroke , ed. Edward Maunde Thompson (Oxford, 1889).King Robert the Bruce By A. F. Murison .Scottish Kings 1005‚Äì1625, by Sir Archibald H Dunbar, Bt., Edinburgh, 1899, p. 127 , where Robert the Bruce's birthplace is given \\"at Writtle, near Chelmsford in Essex, on the 11th July 1274\\". Baker, cited above, is also mentioned with other authorities. but the story is disputed and possibly conflated with his father, Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale. =World War II= During World War II Chelmsford, an important centre of light engineering war production, was attacked from the air on several occasions, both by aircraft of the Luftwaffe and by missile. The worst single loss of life took place on Tuesday 19 December 1944, when the 367th Vergeltungswaffe 2 or V2 rocket to hit England fell on a residential street (Henry Road) near the Hoffmans ball bearing factory and not far from the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company factory in New Street, which may also have been the target (Hoffmans factory was key to the war effort, supplying bearings for countless applications, making it a key target). Thirty-nine people were killed and 138 injured, 47 seriously. Several dwellings in Henry Road were completely destroyed, and many in nearby streets were badly damaged. A recently restored monument to the dead is in the city cemetery in Writtle Road. On 13 May 1943 Luftwaffe bombing raids hit Chelmsford leaving more than 50 people dead and making nearly 1,000 residents homeless. The bombs on this night were dropped mainly in the town centre, Springfield and Moulsham. The GHQ Line part of the British hardened field defences of World War II runs directly through Chelmsford with many pillboxes still in existence to the north and south of the city. Hylands Park, the site of the former annual V Festival, hosted a prisoner of war camp, and from 1944 was the headquarters of the Special Air Service (SAS).The History of Hylands , Chelmsford City Council, published 24 November 2004. Retrieved 20 October 2010 =Recent history= Since the 1980s Chelmsford has suffered from a decline in its defence-related industries, most notably the Marconi Company with all of its factories either being closed or sold. The site on West Hanningfield Road was sold to BAE Systems; the Waterhouse Lane site sold to E2V and the New Street site is undergoing major redevelopment for residential/mixed use. However, the city's location close to London and at the centre of Essex has helped it grow in importance as an administrative and distribution centre. The one-time largest employer in Chelmsford, RHP, the former Hoffman ball bearing manufacturing company, closed its New Street/Rectory Lane site in 1989.

The company was later called the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company Ltd. For this reason Chelmsford is credited as the \\"birthplace of radio\\", and this phrase can be seen on administrative signs on major roads entering the city, although this statement is disputed. Marconi soon outgrew its Hall Street premises, and in June 1912 the company moved to the brand new purpose-built New Street Works. On 15 June 1920 the factory was the location of the first official publicised sound broadcast in the United Kingdom, featuring Dame Nellie Melba using two radio broadcasting masts. In 1922, the world's first regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began from the Marconi laboratories at Writtle near Chelmsford ‚Äì Call sign '2MT' in what was little more than a wooden hut. In 1999, Marconi's defence division, including the Chelmsford facilities, was purchased by British Aerospace to form BAE Systems. Two sites remain under BAE control; the Great Baddow site which is now BAE's Advanced Technology Centre and its Integrated Systems Technologies business at Glebe Road. The military and secure communications division of Marconi was merged into Selex Communications was based at the New Street factory however they vacated the site in April 2008 with the remaining operations moved to nearby Basildon. This brought to an end of more than 100 years of the Marconi name in Chelmsford. The New Street factory was scheduled to be redeveloped with work planned to start during 2010,Project Wireless Consultation ‚Äì Newsletter Issue 1: Winter 2006 Retrieved 24 December 2007, however this fell through after the new site owners Ashwell Property Group entered administration in December 2009. The New Street factory remained empty, derelict and vandalised for several years much to the dismay of Marconi Veterans and Chelmsfordians. The site was finally sold for redevelopment to Bellway Homes in the summer of 2012 with demolition of the majority of the site including the iconic Marconi House and Building 720 in April/May 2013. Only the Grade II listed water tower, The 1912 front building fa√ßade, the New Street cottages and the power house will remain. =Cromptons Electrical Engineering= Chelmsford became home to the United Kingdom's first electrical engineering works established by Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton. Crompton as he was better known was a leading authority of electrical engineering and was a pioneer of electric street lighting and electric traction motors within the United Kingdom. Crompton installed electric street lights around the town centre to celebrate the incorporation of the Borough of Chelmsford in 1888. Although this made Chelmsford one of the earliest towns to receive electric street lighting, the Council later decided to have it removed because gas was cheaper and the Council owned the gasworks. Crompton supplied the traction motors for the first electric trains on Southend Pier. The company also manufactured electrical switchgear, alternators and generators for many power stations in the UK and worldwide. Crompton set up his original factory known as the 'Arc Works' in Queen Street in 1878. After a fire there in 1895, he built a huge new electrical engineering factory also called the 'Arc Works' in Writtle Road. The Firm was called Crompton and Co. and in 1927 became Crompton Parkinson after Colonel Crompton formed a business partnership with fellow British electrical engineer Frank Parkinson. During World War II, the factory was frequently targeted by the Luftwaffe. In 1969 Crompton Parkinson Ltd was downsized and operations moved elsewhere after a takeover by Hawker Siddeley and the site was taken over by the Marconi Company and became the base for the newly formed Marconi Radar Systems.Simons, R. & Sutherland, J., Forty Years of Marconi Radar from 1946 to 1986 , GEC Review, (1998). Retrieved 24 December 2007. After years of decline, the Marconi factory finally closed in 1992 and the site was demolished a few years later apart from the frontage on Writtle Road. A housing development called 'The Village' now occupies the site with road names such as Rookes Crescent, Evelyn Place, Crompton Street and Parkinson Drive as tributes to the former occupant. = Hoffmann Ball Bearings = Hoffmann Ball bearings was a major employer in Chelmsford in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They produced ball bearings which were used for early transatlantic flight. The firm became Ransome Hoffmann and Pollard (R.H.P.) after Hoffman's amalgamation with Ransome & Marles and Pollard Ball and Roller Bearing Company in 1969.The Times, Tuesday, 14 October 1969; pg. 19; Issue 57690 The R.H.P. brand, intellectual property rights and company assets were absorbed into the Japanese NSK Ltd. bearing company in early 1990 trading as NSK-RHP Ltd. at its UK base in Newark on Trent with the historic R.H.P. name finally disappearing in 2001. Most of the former Hoffman New Street factory was demolished during the summer of 1990 and the site is now occupied by the sprawling Rivermead Campus of the Anglia Ruskin University. The only connection to the company name in Chelmsford today is the RHP Bowls club located on part of the old Hoffmans Social Club site at Canterbury Way and Hoffmans Way at the corner of the old factory site at New Street and Rectory Lane. =English Electric Valve Company= The Waterhouse Lane‚Äìbased company began in the early 1940s as a part of the Marconi group, manufacturing magnetrons for defence radar systems.

It continues to operate there. =Britvic= Britvic House, the former Britvic headquarters The Britvic soft drink company began life as the British Vitamin Company in 1948. However, the origins of the company can be traced back to a chemist's shop in Tindal Street where flavoured waters were on sale as early as the mid-19th century. The company was acquired by Showerings of Shepton Mallet, and subsequently a division of Allied Breweries from 1968, The British Vitamin Company changed its name to Britvic in 1971. In 1986 it merged with Canada Dry Rawlings and acquired the R. White's Lemonade brand. It acquired Tango from Beechams in 1987 and since that year it has also owned the UK franchise for Pepsi and 7 Up. In 1995 it bought Robinson's from Reckitt & Colman. In December 2005 the Company underwent an initial public offering (IPO) allowing its main shareholders (InterContinental Hotels Group, Whitbread, Pernod Ricard) to realise their investments.

Transport Chelmsford railway station =Rail= The Eastern Counties Railway arrived in Chelmsford in 1842, although owing to the geography of the town, three viaducts had to be constructed, the longest of which is the 18 arch Central Park viaduct. The station was built at the end of the second viaduct with the third viaduct at the River Chelmer at Springfield. The present-day Chelmsford railway station dates from around 1885 and is in the city centre and around 14,000 commuters travel to London Liverpool Street daily on Greater Anglia services, making Chelmsford one of the busiest non-terminus stations outside London until 2010 when three early morning services were added starting at Chelmsford operating to London and three late evening services terminating at Chelmsford from London. Southbound services operate to London Liverpool Street and northbound services run to Colchester, Ipswich, Clacton-on-Sea, Harwich, Braintree and Norwich via the Great Eastern Main Line. Despite having platforms elevated on a viaduct, the station has full disabled access via a lift for each of the two platforms and as well as stair access. This dates from an extensive refurbishment of the station's ground-level facilities in the late 1980s by British Rail. Since 2011, a second station has been proposed to serve the new Beaulieu housing developments to the north-east of Chelmsford.Chelmsford City Council ‚Äì North Chelmsford: Beaulieu Park Station (Accessed 9 June 2014)Essex Chronicle, 17 March 2014 ‚Äì New homes plan for Chelmsford will see ¬£70m boost to city (Accessed 9 June 2014) =Bus= A new bus terminal in Duke Street opened in March 2007 which replaced an ageing 1930s bus station. It incorporates shops and apartments and has a covered roof for passengers. This is mainly used by First Essex which has many routes around the city and beyond including the X10 & X30 Essex Airlink. Other bus companies serving the area include Stephensons of Essex, Hedingham and Arriva Colchester. There are also a variety of school buses serving the city and surrounding areas. Outside of peak times many of these services are run under contract to Essex County Council. Arriva also operate a single service, the 59 route, to Harlow from Chelmsford, via Roxwell, The Rodings, Hatfield Heath and Old Harlow. The route is on the Hertfordshire Intalink network, allowing single-operator access to destinations within Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire, as well as select Greater London destinations such as Stanmore and Barnet. The route was previously operated by Tellings-Golden Miller. Essex County Council Highways & Transportation Department have considered the construction of a Bus Rapid Transit System to be built serving the Beaulieu Park/Springfield Area because of the increasing demand for Rapid Transit Plans in Ipswich, Colchester and Southend. Chelmsford has a park & ride service that is based at nearby Sandon, just off the A12 at Junction 18. It runs from 7 am to 7 pm, Monday to Saturday, with five bus stops around the city (one near High Chelmer for shopping), and charges ¬£2.50 per adult and is free for old-age pensioners or people under the age of 16. An adult weekly ticket is ¬£12.50 and Adult monthly ¬£47.00. It has a capacity of 1,200 cars. Opened in March 2006, it has proved highly successful and is widely used. A second park & ride service known as the Chelmer Valley Park and Ride was opened on the A130/131 to the north of the city near the village of Little Waltham in April 2011.http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/news/park_and_ride_open.html =Road= The A12 trunk road, running from London to Great Yarmouth originally built by the Romans to connect London and Colchester, used to pass through the city but is now diverted around the east. The ¬£34.8m nine-mile (14 km) bypass opened in November 1986. It is a very important route, linking London and the M25 motorway with the docks at Harwich and Felixstowe, and the East Coast. Despite being notorious for frequent congestion, poor road surfaces and potholes, as well as accidents, many people move to Chelmsford for it being so well connected by not only rail services, but roads. The A414 trunk road, running from Hemel Hempstead to nearby Maldon, is a main road into the city, just off the A12, and also links the city to the M11 motorway at J7 near Harlow. The A130 provides an important link down to the A127 and A13, while the A131 passes through smaller towns and villages. The nearest motorway is the M25 London Orbital at J11 on the A12, 14 miles away. Chelmsford is around 25 to 30 minutes' drive from Stansted Airport (via A130/A120), and London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London City, Luton and Southend airports are all within reach. In the southwest of the city centre, the A138 meets the A414 at The Army and Navy roundabout which is notorious for its traffic congestion, even though the north‚Äìsouth road at this point is no longer part of the A12. Until 1986, when the Chelmsford bypass was opened, the roundabout was in an even worse state. Traffic lights were tried to improve matters in the early 2000s but that scheme was abandoned after a short while however some of the lights where recommissioned for early morning and evening part-time use in 2009. The recently built bus lane on the A1114 Great Baddow Bypass and priority to traffic using it has meant traffic queues approaching the roundabout can now be over long during peak periods. The roundabout is still called \\"The Army and Navy\\" even though the public house from which the junction got its name has long been demolished. The junction was until 2019 unusual for its flyover, in a similar manner to the Hogarth Roundabout in Chiswick, London. The flyover was bi-directional, being open where traffic goes one way into city (westerly) until 2.30 pm each day and one way (easterly) out of the city after 2.30 pm. The Army and Navy roundabout flyover was condemned as unsafe and permanently closed in September 2019 by Essex County Council with demolition works taking place in February/March 2020.https://www.essexhighways.org/highway-schemes/a1060-a1114-army-and-navy- flyover-chelmsford.aspx Construction of the ¬£32 million replacement A138 'Chelmer Viaduct' road which connects Chelmer Village Way roundabout to the Army and Navy roundabout began in February 2015. The new bridge replaced the previous 1932 built structure which was demolished in 2016. Since 2 September 2013 to save money and reduce carbon emissions, many streets lights in the Chelmsford district switched over to Essex County Council's part-night street lighting scheme. This involves most street lights being switched off between 1:00 am and 5:00 am (Tuesday to Sunday) with exceptions such as the city centre area, key road junctions, some pedestrian crossings and known accident sites. On Monday mornings the switch off is from midnight to 5:00 am. =Future transport plans= Map of route for the proposed new Chelmsford bypass Proposals for a bypass of Chelmsford connecting the A12 interchange at Boreham (Junction 19) and the A131 were put forward for public consultation by Essex County Council in 2006, the preferred route was announced in March 2007. It comprises the creation of of two-lane dual carriageway and junctions connecting to the A12 and A131, it will sever 10 footpaths/bridleways and involve almost entirely greenfield construction. The scheme was estimated to cost ¬£138 million in March 2007 but was increased to an estimated range of ¬£229 ‚Äì ¬£262 million in February 2008. The scheme still requires funding and planning permission with applications timetabled for 2009‚Äì2011, a public inquiry timetabled for 2012 and with an estimated construction start date of 2014‚Äì2016. The Chelmsford North Action Group (NAG) objects to this scheme, stating that Chelmsford was to \\"be engulfed by huge motorways connecting the Channel Ports, via a new Lower Thames Crossing, A130, on to Stansted, M11 and A14\\". A second new Park and Ride scheme on the A130 near Little Waltham in addition to that at Sandon began construction in March 2010 at a price of ¬£7.9 million. There has been criticism of the park and ride as some worry it would be unable to provide a service to the nearby Broomfield Hospital from the new site. The Little Waltham Park and Ride opened in April 2011. A new second railway station for the city was announced in September 2009 and is due to be built near the Boreham Interchange. Completion for the project is likely to be in 2020. =Redevelopment= A major new development on the site of the old bus station was completed in 2007 which contains a new Bus Station, shops and luxury apartments. The lower level apartments of this development and the Bus Station area is known as \\"Marconi Plaza\\" while the upper level apartments are known as the \\"Kings Tower\\". The Bus Station and shops were opened in January 2007 while the rest of the development was ready in September 2007. A new housing development site near Beaulieu Park towards the north of the city is currently under construction. It will be an urban village containing around 3,500 homes. The Public House \\"The Army and Navy\\" from which the roundabout gets its name was demolished in March 2007. It was replaced by a Travelodge Hotel, a Frankie & Benny's Restaurant, a bed store and private apartments. Building work started at the site in October 2007 and the project was completed in December 2008. One of Chelmsford's two joint-tallest buildings, Melbourne Court (now renamed Parkside Court) in Melbourne Avenue, has received an ¬£8,000,000 investment for extensive refurbishment and to create a new Neighbourhood Centre. This was completed early in 2009. Recently, plans were revealed for 'Waterside', a large development of shops, bars and restaurants on the banks of the River Chelmer on derelict land near the Essex Records Office at the end of Wharf Road. If this development goes ahead, High Bridge Road connecting Parkway and Springfield Road would be demolished along with the adjacent gasometers and a new central link road would be built. The former Anglia Ruskin University central campus off Park Road was demolished in January/February 2010 and has been redeveloped by social housing provider Genesis as a mixed use development of housing for social rent, alongside other new housing for private sale and several retail units, new squares, streets and plazas. The new development has been given the name ' City Park West'. High Chelmer Shopping Centre underwent a refit during 2008/2009 with new flooring, lighting with a new front entrance and logo re-brand. Further work is being carried out in the shopping centre; an old portion was demolished in Spring 2011. The work was completed in early 2012. In January 2011, John Lewis announced together with development partner Aquila House Holdings that it was to anchor a brand new department store as part of a retail development at Bond Street. The site opened in September 2016.

Chelmsford Prison is a male prison and Young Offenders Institution, constructed in 1830. The 1979 film special of the TV series Porridge was filmed largely on location at Chelmsford Prison (while it was closed for repairs after a fire). Hylands House and Park just to the west of the city is a country house and parkland, saved from dereliction and purchased by the local council in 1966 after the death of the last private owner. Much damaged by fire and vandalism by the time of the sale, the house has now been completely restored by Chelmsford City Council. The house dates from 1730, and the park, , was landscaped by Humphry Repton. It is open to the public and used for a wide range of community events, including the annual music festival V Festival. It is also available for weddings and other private hires including conferences etc. The 21st World Scout Jamboree 2007 was held at Hylands Park from 27 July to 8 August 2007. Within the grounds which comprise woodland, rolling grassland and lakes is a large children's play area with adjoining car parking. Chelmsford Museum in Oaklands Park, off Moulsham Street, is a local history and industrial heritage museum which also incorporates the Essex Regiment Museum. A major ¬£5 million extension and redevelopment scheme opened in January 2010 and the museum now includes exhibits and interactive displays focusing on Crompton, Marconi, and Hoffmann, as well as illustrating the development of the town and city from prehistory up to modern times. Further development in 2019 upgraded the museum to include new visitor facilities as well as new exhibits from the Saxon burial site at Broomfield.

Geography and climate =Geology= From over 600,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene ice age, until the Anglian Stage around 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, the early River Thames flowed through the area where Chelmsford now stands, from Harlow to Colchester, before crossing what is now the North Sea to become a tributary of the Rhine. Consequently, gravel deposits are frequently found in the area and current and former gravel pits in the district are common. Chelmsford has two rivers, the River Can and the River Chelmer. Although often confused to be the same river in the city centre, they are quite separate until they join together towards the east of the city to form the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation which heads out towards Maldon before flowing into tidal waters at the Blackwater Estuary. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near Thaxted while the Can comes from the West from Writtle where it separates from the River Wid. Up to the 1960s, these rivers were extremely prone to flooding the city centre area including two disastrous floods in August 1888 (known locally as 'The Great Flood') and in September 1958 (which also badly affected nearby Wickford) causing widespread damage. Flood prevention schemes in the 1960s on both rivers have largely prevented any further incidents here although the natural floodplains to the north and east such as The 'Baddow Meads' and The 'Chelmer Valley' continue to see flooding on a regular basis especially after prolonged heavy rainfall. =Climate= As with the large majority of the UK, Chelmsford has a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb in the K√∂ppen climate classification, however due to the proximity to continental Europe, Chelmsford enjoys warm summers and cool but not cold winters, with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature. With Chelmsford in the southeast of England, the city enjoys a warmer climate than most of the United Kingdom; it is also one of the driest areas in the country.

In early translations, Existentialism and Humanism was the title used in the United Kingdom; the work was originally published in the United States as Existentialism, and a later translation employs the original title. The work, once influential and a popular starting-point in discussions of Existentialist thought, has been widely criticized by philosophers, including Sartre himself, who later rejected some of the views he expressed in it. Summary Sartre asserts that the key defining concept of existentialism is that the existence of a person is prior to their essence. The term \\"existence precedes essence\\" subsequently became a maxim of the existentialist movement. Put simply, this means that there is nothing to dictate that person's character, goals in life, and so on; that only the individual can define their essence. According to Sartre, \\"man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world ‚Äì and defines himself afterwards\\". Thus, Sartre rejects what he calls \\"deterministic excuses\\" and claims that people must take responsibility for their behavior. Sartre defines anguish as the emotion that people feel once they realize that they are responsible not just for themselves, but for all humanity. Anguish leads people to realize that their actions guide humanity and allows them to make judgments about others based on their attitude towards freedom. Anguish is also associated with Sartre's notion of despair, which he defines as optimistic reliance on a set of possibilities that make action possible. Sartre claims that \\"In fashioning myself, I fashion Man\\", saying that the individual's action will affect and shape mankind. The being-for-itself uses despair to embrace freedom and take meaningful action in full acceptance of whatever consequences may arise as a result. He also describes abandonment as the loneliness that atheists feel when they realize that there is no God to prescribe a way of life, no guidance for people on how to live; that we're abandoned in the sense of being alone in the universe and the arbiters of our own essence. Sartre closes his work by emphasizing that existentialism, as it is a philosophy of action and one's defining oneself, is optimistic and liberating. Publication history First published in French in 1946, Existentialism and Humanism was published in an English translation by Philip Mairet in 1948. In the United States, the work was originally published as Existentialism. The work has also been published in German translation. An English translation by Carol Macomber, with an introduction by the sociologist Annie Cohen-Solal and notes and preface by Arlette Elka√Øm-Sartre, was published under the title Existentialism Is a Humanism in 2007. Reception Existentialism Is a Humanism has been \\"a popular starting-point in discussions of existentialist thought,\\" and in the philosopher Thomas Baldwin's words, \\"seized the imagination of a generation.\\" However, Sartre himself later rejected some of the views he expressed in the work, and regretted its publication. Other philosophers have critiqued the lecture on various grounds: Martin Heidegger wrote in a letter to the philosopher and Germanist Jean Beaufret that while Sartre's statement that \\"existence precedes essence\\" reverses the metaphysical statement that essence precedes existence, \\"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement.\\" In Heidegger's view, Sartre \\"stays with metaphysics in oblivion of the truth of Being.\\" Marjorie Grene found Sartre's discussion of \\"the problem of the relation between individuals\\" in Existentialism and Humanism to be weaker than the one he had previously offered in Being and Nothingness (1943). Walter Kaufmann commented that the lecture \\"has been widely mistaken for the definitive statement of existentialism,\\" but is rather \\"a brilliant lecture which bears the stamp of the moment.\\" According to Kaufmann, Sartre makes factual errors, including misidentifying philosopher Karl Jaspers as a Catholic, and presenting a definition of existentialism that is open to question. Thomas C. Anderson criticized Sartre for asserting without explanation that if a person seeks freedom from false, external authorities, then he or she must invariably allow this freedom for others. Iris Murdoch found one of Sartre's discussions with a Marxist interesting, but otherwise considered Existentialism and Humanism to be \\"a rather bad little book.\\" Mary Warnock believed Sartre was right to dismiss the work. The philosopher Frederick Copleston stated that Sartre, like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Edmund Husserl, interpreted the views of Ren√© Descartes as an anticipation of his own philosophical views. The neurobiologist Steven Rose described a statement in which Sartre maintained that man \\"will be what he makes of himself\\" as a \\"windily rhetorical paean to the dignity of universalistic man\\" and \\"more an exercise in political sloganeering than a sustainable philosophical position.\\" He pointed to aging and disease as examples of factors that limit human freedom. The philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek argued that there is a parallel between Sartre's views and claims made by the character Father Zosima in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov (1880): whereas Sartre believes that with total freedom comes total responsibility, for Father Zosima \\"each of us must make us responsible for all men's sins\\".

It was founded in 1921 as Out of the Inkwell, inc. by brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer who ran the pioneering company from its inception until Paramount Pictures, the studio's parent company and the distributor of its films, acquired ownership. In its prime, Fleischer Studios was a premier producer of animated cartoons for theaters, with Walt Disney Productions becoming its chief competitor in the 1930s. Fleischer Studios characters included Koko the Clown, Betty Boop, Bimbo, Popeye the Sailor, and Superman. Unlike other studios, whose characters were anthropomorphic animals, the Fleischers' most successful characters were humans (with the exception of Bimbo, who was a black-and-white cartoon dog). The cartoons of the Fleischer Studio were very different from the Disney product, both in concept and in execution. As a result, the Fleischer cartoons were rough rather than refined, consciously artistic rather than commercial. But in their unique way, their artistry was expressed through a culmination of the arts and sciences.Pointer, Ray (2016). The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer, McFarland & Co. Publishers. Pg. 5 This approach focused on surrealism, dark humor, adult psychological elements, and sexuality. Furthermore, the environments were grittier and urban, often set in squalid surroundings, reflecting the Great Depression as well as German Expressionism.  History  = The Silent Era = The Fleischer Studio was built on Max Fleischer's novelty film series, Out of the Inkwell (1919-1927). The novelty was based largely on the results of the \\"Rotoscope\\", invented by Fleischer to produce realistic animation. The first \\"Out of the Inkwell\\" films were produced through The Bray Studio. They featured Fleischer's first character, \\"The Clown,\\" which became known as Ko-Ko the Clown in 1924. In 1921, The Bray Studio ran afoul with legal issues, having contracted for more films than it could deliver to its distributor, The Goldwyn Company. The Fleischer Brothers left and began their own studio with Dave as Director and Production Supervisor, and Max as Producer. In 1924, animator, Dick Huemer came to The Inkwell Studio and redesigned \\"The Clown\\" for more efficient animation. Huemer's new design and experience as an Animator moved them away from their dependency on The Rotoscope for fluid animation. In addition to defining the clown, Huemer established the Fleischer style with its distinctive thick and thin ink lines. In addition, Huemer created Ko-Ko's companion, Fitz the Dog, who would evolve into Bimbo in 1930. Throughout the 1920s, Fleischer was one of the leading producers of animation with clever moments and numerous innovations. These innovations include the \\"Rotograph\\", an early \\"Aerial Image\\" photographic process for compositing animation with live action backgrounds. Other innovations included Ko-Ko Song Car-Tunes and sing-along shorts (featuring the famous \\"bouncing ball\\"), a precursor to Karaoke. In 1924, Distributor, Edwin Miles Fadiman, and Hugo Riesenfeld formed the Red Seal Pictures Corporation. Riesenfeld was the Theatrical Manager of the Strand, Rivoli, and Rialto theaters on Broadway. Because the Out of the Inkwell films were a major part of the program in Riesenfeld's theaters, the Fleischers were invited to become partners. The Red Seal Company committed to an ambitious release schedule of 26 films with The Inkwell Studio as the primary supplier. The following year, Red Seal released 141 films that included documentaries, short comedy subjects, and live-action serials. Carrie of the Chorus, also known as Backstage Comedies, was one of the Red Seal series that featured Max's daughter, Ruth in a supporting role. Ray Bolger made his screen debut in this series and dated Ruth for a short time. Red Seal released cartoon novelty series such as The Animated Hair Cartoons by Cartoonist ‚ÄúMarcus,‚Äù and Inklings. The Animated Hair series resembled the on-screen hand drawing gimmick establish in Out of the Inkwell. In this case, ‚ÄúMarcus‚Äù produced high-quality ink line portraits of celebrities and political figures. Then through stop motion animation techniques, the lines and forms would break away to entertainingly re-form the portrait into another. Inklings was similar in concept to the Animated Hair films, but was more of a visual puzzle novelty using a variety of progressive scratch- off/reveal techniques and rearranged animated cutouts to change the images. It was during this time that Lee de Forest started filming his Phonofilms experiments featuring several of the major Broadway headliners. The Red Seal company began acquiring more theaters outside of New York and equipped them with sound equipment produced by Lee de Forest, displaying ‚Äútalkies‚Äù three years before the sound revolution began. Because of Max's interest in technology, Riesenfeld introduced him to deForest. And it was through this partnership that Max produced a number of the Ko-Ko Song Car-tunes as sound releases. Of the 36 song films produced between 1924 and 1927, 12 were produced as sound films beginning in 1926 with standard silent versions as well. The first sound release was Mother Pin a Rose on Me. Other sound releases included Darling Nellie Gray, Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly?, When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam‚Äô, Coming Through the Rye, My Wife‚Äôs Gone to the Country, Margie, Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning, Sweet Adeline, Old Black Joe, Come Take A Trip in My Airship, and By the Light of the Silvery Moon. Red Seal owned 56 theaters, extending as far west as Cleveland, Ohio. But after only two years of operation, Red Seal was broke. Max (Fleischer) sought an appointment of receiver in bankruptcy in October 1926. Just as the situation looked hopeless, Alfred Weiss appeared from the horizon with a Paramount contact.Pointer, Ray (2016) The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer, McFarland & Co. Publishers. pp. 65‚Äì70 The Paramount deal provided financing and distribution. But due to legal complications of the bankruptcy, the title to Out of the Inkwell was changed to The Inkwell Imps (1927-1929). One year into the relationship, the Fleischer Brothers discovered mismanagement under Weiss and left before the end of the Imps contract. Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc. filed bankruptcy in January 1929. In March, Max formed Fleischer Studios with Dave as his partner. Operations were first set up at the Carpenter-Goldman Laboratories in Queens. With a skeleton staff, Fleischer Studios started out doing industrial films, most notably, Finding His Voice, a technical demonstration film explaining Western Electric's Variable Density recording and reproduction system. Max Fleischer secured a new contract with Paramount to produce a revival of the \\"Bouncing Ball\\" song films, re-branded as Screen Songs, with The Sidewalks of New York as the first release in 1929. = Sound films = Betty Boop, from the opening title sequence of the earliest entries in the Betty Boop Cartoons series The early experiments with sound synchronization gave Fleischer Studios experience in perfecting the post-production method of recording, aided by several inventions by founder, Max Fleischer. And with the conversion to sound, Paramount needed more sound films, and cartoons could be produced faster than feature films. As the Screen Songs returned Fleischer to the established song film format, a new sound series, Talkartoons replaced the silent Inkwell Imps, the first being Noah's Lark released October 25, 1929. Earlier entries in the series were one-shot cartoons, until the appearance of Bimbo as of the fourth entry. Bimbo evolved through several redesigns in each cartoon or the first year. While the intent was to develop him as the star of the series, it was the cameo appearance of a Helen Kane caricature in the seventh entry, Dizzy Dishes that took center stage. Audience reactions to the New York preview were so great that Paramount encourage the continued development of the most famous character to come from the Fleischer Studio by that time, Betty Boop. While originated as a hybrid human/canine character, Betty Boop was transformed into the human character she is known as by 1932. Having become the main attraction of the Talkartoons, she was given her own series, which ran until 1939. The \\"Jazz Baby\\" Flapper character, Betty Boop lifted the spirits of Depression Era audiences with her paradoxical mixture of childlike innocence and sexual allure. And being a musical novelty character, she was a natural for theatrical entertainment. Several of her early cartoons were developed as promotional vehicles for some of the top Black Jazz performers of the day including Louis Armstrong (I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal, You), Don Redman (I Heard), and most notably, the three cartoons made with Cab Calloway, Minnie the Moocher, Snow White, and The Old Man of the Mountain. This was considered a bold action in light of the Jim Crow policies active in the South where such films would not be shown. In 1934, the Hays Code resulted in severe censorship for films. This affected the content of all of Paramount's films as well, which tended to reflect a more \\"mature\\" tone in the features of the Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, and most of all, Mae West. As a result, each of these stars was released as Paramount changed the content of its films to reflect a more \\"general audience\\" in order to comply with the new Code and stay in business. Paramount had also gone through three reorganizations from bankruptcy between 1931 and 1936. And the new management under Barney Balaban set out to make more general audience films of the type made at MGM, but for lower budgets. This change in content policy affected the content of cartoons that Fleischer was to produce for Paramount, urging the emulation of the Walt Disney product. Popeye the Sailor (seen in Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves) became one of Fleischer Studios' most successful characters, surpassing even Disney's Mickey Mouse in popularity for a time. While Paramount was a large organization with a network of theaters, its fiscal consciousness was largely responsible for preventing Fleischer Studios from acquiring the three-strip Technicolor process, leaving it available for a four-year exclusivity with Walt Disney, who created a new market for color cartoons, established by Academy Award winner, Flowers and Trees (1932). Paramount relinquished to the release of the Color Classics series starting in 1934. But with the exclusivity of the three-color process still held by Disney, Fleischer Studios used the available two-color processes, Cinecolor, a two-emulsion red and blue process, and Two-color Technicolor, using red and green. By 1936, the Disney exclusivity had expired, and Fleischer Studios used the three-color process in its color cartoons beginning with Somewhere in Dreamland and continued using it for the remainder of its active years. The Fleischer Studio's greatest success came with the licensing of E.C. Segar's comic strip character Popeye the Sailor beginning in 1933. Popeye eventually became the most popular series the studio ever produced, and its success surpassed Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse cartoons, documented by popularity polls. And with the availability of full spectrum color, the Fleischer Studios produced three two-reel Popeye featurettes, Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor (1936), Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves (1937), and Popeye the Sailor Meets Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp (1939). This series of longer-format cartoons were an indication of the emergence of the animated feature film as a commercially viable project beginning with Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). The Fleischer Studios had reached its zenith by 1936, with four series and 52 annual releases. Due to the phenomenal success of the Popeye cartoons, Paramount demanded more, and the Fleischer Studio experienced rapid expansion in order to balance out the increased workload. The crowded conditions, production speedups, drawing quotas, and internal management problems resulted in a Labor Strike beginning in May 1937 which lasted for five months. This strike was a test case, the first launched in the motion picture industry, and produced a nationwide boycott of Fleischer cartoons for the duration. Gulliver's Travels (1939) was Fleischer Studios' first feature-length animated production. Max Fleischer had been petitioning Paramount for three years about producing an animated feature. Paramount vetoed his proposals until the proven success of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Paramount now wanted an animated feature for a 1939 Christmas release. This request came at the time of preparations for relocating to Miami, Florida. While the relocation had been a consideration for some time, its final motivation was made a reality due to lower corporate tax structures and an alleged escape from the remaining hostility from the strike. The new Fleischer Studio opened in October 1938, and production on its first feature, Gulliver's Travels (1939), went from the development stage begun in New York to active production in Miami. The score was by Paramount staff composer, Victor Young and recorded at the Paramount west coast facilities. While limited to only 60 theaters in a one-month release, Gulliver's Travels earned more than $3 million, in spite of exceeding its original $500,000 estimated cost. Accordingly, a second feature was ordered for the Christmas period, Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941). = Fall of Fleischer = Renowned for its technical virtuosity, Fleischer's Superman series was nominated for an Academy Award in 1941. The personal relationship between Max and Dave Fleischer deteriorated during the Miami period due to complications associated with the pressures of finishing the studio's first feature film and Dave's very public adulterous affair with his secretary, Mae Schwartz. Max and Dave had stopped speaking to each other altogether by the end of 1939. Dave gained total control of production in 1940, relegating Max to business affairs and research. The studio was in need of new products going into the new decade, but the new shorts series that debuted in 1939 and 1940, Gabby, Stone Age Cartoons, and Animated Antics, were unsuccessful. Theater operators complained, with the Popeye cartoons having the only value. Paramount acquired the rights to comic book superhero Superman in 1941, and the Fleischers were assigned to work on a series of animated Superman shorts. The first entry, Superman, had a budget of $50,000,Barrier, Michael (1999). Hollywood Cartoons. New York: Oxford University Press. Pg. 304. the highest ever for a Fleischer theatrical short, and was nominated for an Academy Award. The animated Superman series, with its action-adventure and science fiction fantasy content, was a huge success, but that did not help the studio out of its financial trouble. It was penalized $350,000 for going over budget on Gulliver's Travels, and the revenues earned from the rentals of the Popeye cartoons had to be used to offset the loss of $250,000 incurred by the rejection of cartoons in 1940. = Acquisition by Paramount = While profits dwindled, Paramount continued to advance money to Fleischer Studios to continue the production of cartoons with its focus mainly on Popeye, Superman, and Mr. Bug Goes to Town, a new feature film for the 1941 Christmas season; all in hope of rekindling the studio. On May 24, 1941, Paramount demanded reimbursement on the penalties still owed after 18 months and assumed full ownership of Fleischer Studios, Inc.Barrier, Michael (1999). Hollywood Cartoons. New York: Oxford University Press. Pgs. 303-305. . The Fleischers remained in control of production until November 1941. Mr. Bug Goes to Town, intended for release in December 1941, was not released until February 1942, and never recouped its costs. In spite of living up to his contractual obligations and delivering the film, Max Fleischer was asked to resign. Dave Fleischer had resigned the month before, and Paramount finished out the last five months of the Fleischer contract without of the Fleischer brothers. The last cartoon produced at credited to Fleischer Studios was the Superman cartoon Terror on the Midway. Paramount formed a new company, Famous Studios, as a successor to Fleischer Studios effective May 27, 1942. = Television = With the exception of the Superman and Popeye cartoons, Paramount's cartoon library of releases prior to October 1950 was originally sold to U.M. & M. TV Corporation in 1955. A condition of the purchase required the removal of the Paramount logos and copyright lines from the main titles.http://www.cartoonresearch.com/paramount.html As soon as the Fleischer library was sold to television, Max Fleischer noticed that some of the cartoons were being shown without his name in the credits, which was a violation of his original contracts. On June 17, 1956, Max Fleischer filed suit against Paramount and its TV distribution partners, seeking $2,750,000 in damages. The infringement on his name was corrected on all subsequent prints exhibited on television.Pointer, Ray (2016). The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer, McFarland & Co. Publishers. Pgs 367-368 Before U.M.& M. had finished the title alterations, the company was bought by National Telefilm Associates. NTA placed their logo at the heads and tails of the films and blacked out references to Paramount, Technicolor, Cinecolor, and Polacolor. The majority of the Fleischer cartoons were off the air by the mid 60s when the original copyrights were due for renewal. NTA failed to renew the copyrights, which placed the majority of the Fleischer film library (including the Color Classics series, the Screen Songs series, and Gulliver's Travels) into the public domain. Mr. Bug Goes to Town, various Betty Boop cartoons, and the 1938 Color Classic, The Tears of an Onion, are among the few films that remain under copyright to Melange Pictures, LLC. In the mid-1970s, NTA converted 85 black and white Betty Boop cartoons to color through Fred Ladd's Color Systems company. The process was done by having the cartoons traced and re-colored by Korean animators. These were packaged in 1976 under the title Betty Boop for President. This was refashioned as a compilation feature, Hooray for Betty Boop, and ran on HBO in 1980. Paramount has reacquired ownership of the original Fleischer film library (through their acquisition of Republic Pictures) and continues to own the theatrical rights. Olive Films has the home video rights, and Trifecta Entertainment & Media currently has the TV rights. Viacom and CBS Corporation remerged on December 4, 2019 as ViacomCBS. = Popeye and Superman = The Popeye series, a property licensed from King Features Syndicate was acquired by Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.), which later became part of United Artists (for info on the Popeye retitling, see the a.a.p. article) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Turner Entertainment, after briefly owning MGM outright, settled for ownership of the library, including the Popeye cartoons, in 1986. A small number of Popeye cartoons have also entered the public domain. Superman, the other series based on licensing, reverted to National Comics after Paramount's rights to the character expired. TV syndication rights were initially licensed to Flamingo Films, distributors of the 1950s Superman TV series. All 17 entries in this series entered the public domain in the late 1960s, when National failed to renew their copyrights. Nevertheless, the Superman and Popeye cartoons are now under the ownership of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.; Warner bought the original film elements to the Superman series in 1969, after becoming a sibling (and later the parent) to DC Comics. = Home video = Most of the Fleischer color titles have been widely available on video since the 1980s, often on inexpensive videotapes sold in supermarkets and discount stores. Both animation fans and the UCLA Film and Television Archive have worked to release high-quality restored editions of the Fleischer cartoons. These have also been made available on pay-cable, home video and DVD. Many of these restored versions now include the original front-and-end Paramount titles. Most of the silent Fleischer titles from the Out of the Inkwell/Inkwell Imps series have entered the public domain. An official Betty Boop VHS set, Betty Boop Confidential , was released by Republic Pictures in 1995, included several black-and-white Betty Boop cartoons as well as Betty's only color appearance, Poor Cinderella. There have been several video releases for the Superman series. These include a 1991 VHS set produced by Bosko Video, titled The Complete Superman Collection: Golden Anniversary Edition - The Paramount Cartoon Classics of Max & Dave Fleischer released as two volumes which featured transfers from 35mm prints. It was reissued on DVD as The Complete Superman Cartoons ‚Äî Diamond Anniversary Edition in 2000 by Image Entertainment, and Superman Adventures in 2004 by Platinum Disc Corporation. A third (and more \\"official\\") compilation using restored and remastered materials was released in November 2006 by Warner Home Video as part of their DVD box set of Superman films. In 2009, Warner gave these Superman shorts their own stand-alone 2-disc DVD release, Max Fleischer's Superman: 1941-1942. Olive Films, under exclusive license from Melange/Viacom, acquired the rights to the 66 non-public domain Betty Boop cartoons, and released four volumes of Betty Boop DVDs and Blu-rays. Warner Home Video has released all of the Fleischer Popeye cartoons in three volumes as part of the Popeye the Sailor DVD collection. VCI Entertainment/Kit Parker Films' DVD compilation of all the Color Classics (except The Tears of an Onion), entitled Somewhere In Dreamland, was released in 2003. It includes only a fraction of shorts remastered from 35mm filmM, but otherwise taken from the best available sources Kit Parker could provide VCI, and digitally recreating the original front-and-end Paramount titles, Animation archivist Jerry Beck served as consultant for this box set, as well as providing audio commentary for select shorts. VCI Entertainment also released a DVD compilation of all the public domain Popeye cartoons (both Fleischer and Famous) entitled Popeye the Sailor Man Classic Cartoons: 75th Anniversary Collector's Edition in 2004. In Japan, Mr. Bug Goes to Town was released on DVD in April 2010 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment as part of the Studio Ghibli's Ghibli Museum Library collection.Cartoon Brew: Disney releases \\"Mr. Bug\\" in Japan = Fleischer Studios today = In 1985, DC Comics named Fleischer Studios as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for its work on the Superman cartoons. Today Fleischer Studios continues to hold to the rights to Betty Boop and associated characters such as Koko the Clown, Bimbo and Grampy. It is headed by Max's grandson Mark Fleischer, who oversees merchandising activities. Fleischer Studios utilizes King Features Syndicate to license Fleischer characters for various merchandise.  Legacy and influence  The loose, improvisatory animation, frequently surreal action generally termed \\"The New York Style,\\" (particularly in films such as Snow White and Bimbo's Initiation), grungy atmosphere, and racy pre-Code content of the early Fleischer Studios cartoons have been a major influence on many underground and alternative cartoonists. Kim Deitch, Robert Crumb, Jim Woodring, and Al Columbia are among the creators who have specifically acknowledged their inspiration. Much of Richard Elfman's 1980 cult film Forbidden Zone is a live action pastiche of the early Fleischer Studios style. The Fleischer style was also used in the 1995 animated series The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat. The studio's art style and surreal atmosphere was a central influence on the indie game Cuphead, with the studio being described as \\"magnetic north\\" for the game's art style.

He was commonly referred to as one of the most popular Italian performers of all time. He is best known for his funny and sometimes cynical character as a comedian in theatre and then in many successful films shot from the 1940s to the 1960s, all regularly still on TV, but he also worked with many iconic Italian film directors in dramatic/poetic roles.Cammarota, Il cinema di Tot√≤, Fanucci Editore, 1985 While he first gained his popularity as a comic actor, his dramatic roles, poetry, and songs are all deemed to be outstanding; writer and philosopher Umberto Eco has thus commented on the importance of Tot√≤ in Italian culture: Mario Monicelli, who directed some of the most appreciated of Tot√≤'s movies, thus described his artistic value: Early life Tot√≤ was born Antonio Vincenzo Stefano Clemente on 15 February 1898 in the Rione Sanit√†, a poor district of Naples, the illegitimate son of Anna Clemente (1881-1947), a Sicilian woman, and the Neapolitan marquis Giuseppe de Curtis (1873-1944). His father did not legally recognize him until 1937. He so regretted growing up without a father that, at age 35, he managed to have the marquis Francesco Maria Gagliardi Focas adopt him in exchange for a life annuity. As a consequence, when Marquis de Curtis recognized him, Tot√≤ had become an heir of two noble families, hence claiming an impressive slew of titles. In 1946, when the Consulta Araldica‚Äîthe body that advised the Kingdom of Italy on matters of nobility‚Äîceased operations, the Tribunal of Naples recognized his numerous titles, so his complete name was changed from Antonio Clemente to Antonio Griffo Focas Flavio Ducas Komnenos Gagliardi de Curtis of Byzantium, His Imperial Highness, Palatine Count, Knight of the Holy Roman Empire, Exarch of Ravenna, Duke of Macedonia and Illyria, Prince of Constantinople, Cilicia, Thessaly, Pontus, Moldavia, Dardania, Peloponnesus, Count of Cyprus and Epirus, Count and Duke of Drivasto and Durazzo. For someone born and raised in one of the poorest Neapolitan neighbourhoods, this must have been quite an achievement, but in claiming the titles (at the time they had become meaningless) the comedian also mocked them for their intrinsic worthlessness. In fact, when he was not using his stage name Tot√≤, he mostly referred to himself simply as Antonio de Curtis. Tot√≤ as a soldier in 1918 Tot√≤'s mother wanted him to become a priest, but as early as 1913, at the age of 15, he was already acting as a comedian in small theatres, under the pseudonym Clerment. His early repertoire mostly consisted in imitations of Gustavo De Marco's characters. In the minor venues where he performed, Tot√≤ had the chance to meet famous artists like Eduardo and Peppino De Filippo. He served in the army during World War I and then went back to acting. He learned the art of the guitti, the Neapolitan scriptless comedians, heirs to the tradition of the Commedia dell'Arte, and began developing the trademarks of his style, including a puppet-like, disjointed gesticulation, emphasized facial expressions, and an extreme, sometimes surrealistic, sense of humor, largely based on emphasizing primitive urges such as hunger and sexual desire. Career In 1922, he moved to Rome to perform in bigger theatres. He performed in the genre of avanspettacolo, a vaudevillian mixture of music, ballet and comedy preceding the main act (hence its name, which roughly translates as \\"before show\\"). He became adept at these shows (also known as rivista ‚Äì Revue), and in the 1930s he had his own company, with which he travelled across Italy. In 1937, he appeared in his first movie Fermo con le mani, and later starred in 96 other films, many of which still are broadcast frequently on Italian television. As the vast majority of his movies were essentially meant to showcase his performances, many have his name \\"Tot√≤\\" in the title. Some of his best-known films are Fifa e Arena, Tot√≤ al Giro d'Italia, Tot√≤ Sceicco, Guardie e ladri, Tot√≤ e le donne, Tot√≤ Tarzan, Tot√≤ terzo uomo, Tot√≤ a colori (one of the first Italian color movies, 1952, in Ferraniacolor), I soliti ignoti, Tot√≤, Peppino e la malafemmina, La legge √® legge. Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Hawks and the Sparrows and the episode \\"Che cosa sono le nuvole\\" from Capriccio all'italiana (the latter released after his death), showed his dramatic skills. Tot√≤ in the 1930s In his vast cinematographic career, Tot√≤ had the opportunity to act side by side with virtually all major Italian actors of the time. With some of them he paired in several films, the most renowned and successful teams being established with Aldo Fabrizi and Peppino De Filippo. De Filippo was one of the few actors to have his name appear in movie titles along with that of Tot√≤, for example in Tot√≤, Peppino e la malafemmina and Tot√≤ e Peppino divisi a Berlino. Partly because of the radical, naive immorality of his roles, some of his more spicy gags raised much controversy in a society that was both strictly Catholic and ruled by the conservative Democrazia Cristiana (Christian Democracy) party. For example, Tot√≤'s 1964 movie Che fine ha fatto Tot√≤ Baby? (a parody of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?) included a cheeky and gross celebration of cannabis in an era when drugs were perceived by the Italian audience as something as exotic as depraved and dangerous. Nevertheless, such controversies never affected the love of the Italian audience for him. =Writing= During the 1950s, he started to compose poetry. The best-known is probably 'A Livella, in which an arrogant rich man and a humble poor man meet after their deaths and discuss their differences. Tot√≤ was also a songwriter: Malafemmena (Wayward Woman), dedicated to his wife Diana after they separated, is considered a classic of the Neapolitan popular music. Personal life Signed photograph of Tot√≤ Tot√≤ had a reputation as a playboy. One of his lovers, the well known chanteuse and dancer , committed suicide after their relationship ended. This tragedy marked his life. He buried Liliana in his family's chapel, and named his only daughter Liliana (born 10 May 1933 to his first wife, Diana Bandini Rogliani, whom he married in 1935). Another personal tragedy was the premature birth of his son Massenzio in 1954. The child died a few hours later. He was the son of Tot√≤'s mistress Franca Faldini. During a tour in 1956, he lost most of his eyesight due to an eye infection that he had ignored to avoid cancelling his show and disappointing his fans. The handicap however almost never affected his schedule and acting abilities. Death Tot√≤ died at the age of 69 on 15 April 1967 in Rome after a series of heart attacks. Due to overwhelming demand, there were no fewer than three funeral services: the first in Rome, a second in his birth city of Naples‚Äîand a few days later, in a third one by the local Camorra boss, an empty casket was carried along the packed streets of the popular Rione Sanit√† quarter where he was born.

Ban-sugoroku Ban-sugoroku plays identically to backgammon (it even has the same starting position), except for the following differences: * Doubles are not special. If a player rolls doubles, each die still counts only once. * There is no \\"bearing off\\". The goal is to move all of one's men to within the last six spaces of the board. * There is no doubling cube. * \\"Closing out\\", that is forming a prime of six contiguous points with one or more of opponents men on the bar, is an automatic win. The game is thought to have been introduced from China (where it was known as Shuanglu) into Japan in the sixth century. It is known that in the centuries following the game's introduction into Japan it was made illegal several times, most prominently in 689 and 754. This is because the simple and luck-based nature of sugoroku made it an ideal gambling game. This version of sugoroku and records of playing for gambling continuously appeared until early Edo era. In early Edo-era, a new and quick gambling game called Ch≈ç-han (‰∏ÅÂçä) appeared and using sugoroku for gambling quickly dwindled. This variant of the backgammon family has died out in Japan and most other countries, with the Western style modern backgammon (with doubling-cube) having some avid players. E-sugoroku E-Sugoroku (1925) A simpler e-sugoroku, with rules similar to snakes and ladders, appeared as early as late 13th century and was made popular due to the cheap and elaborate wooden block printing technology of the Edo period. Thousands of variations of boards were made with pictures and themes from religion, political, actors, and even adult material. In the Meiji and later periods, this variation of the game remained popular and was often included in child-oriented magazines. With ban-sugoroku being obsolete, today the word sugoroku almost always means e-sugoroku. Other Sugoroku games Many sugoroku-based video games were released, including: Kiteretsu Daihyakka: Ch≈çjik≈´ Sugoroku, Sugoroku Ginga Senki, Battle Hunter, Ganbare Goemon: Mononoke Sugoroku, Dokodemo Hamster 4: Doki Doki Sugoroku Daibouken!, Hello Kitty: Minna de Sugoroku, Gotouchi Hello Kitty Sugoroku Monogatari, Yu-Gi-Oh! Sugoroku's Board Game, Family Pirate Party, Hidamari Sketch: Doko Demo Sugoroku x 365, and PictureBook Games: Pop-Up Pursuit. The video game Samurai Warriors 2 features a mini-game named Sugoroku, but it bears very little resemblance to traditional Sugoroku. Instead, it plays very much like Itadaki Street, Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise, or a simplified version of Monopoly: players take turns in moving around a board, the spaces of which are designated as different territories of Japan. By landing on an unoccupied space, the player is able to buy that space for a set amount of money. If one player lands on a space purchased by another, they must pay a fee to that player, or else can choose to challenge the player for control of that space (utilising the main Samurai Warriors 2 game engine for special challenge games). Also present on the board are \\"Shrine\\" spaces, which are roughly analogous to Monopoly's Chance and Community Chest spaces. The Mario Party series can be seen with heavy influences from sugoroku, especially e-sugoroku. References * Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 1, No. 3/4.

Psychological tests are administered by trained evaluators. A person's responses are evaluated according to carefully prescribed guidelines. Scores are thought to reflect individual differences in the construct the test purports to measure.The science behind psychological testing is psychometrics.  Psychological tests  According to Anastasi and Urbina, psychological tests involve observations made on a \\"carefully chosen sample [emphasis authors] of an individual's behavior.\\" A psychological test is often designed to measure unobserved constructs, also known as latent variables. Psychological tests can include a series of tasks or problems that the respondent has to solve. Psychological tests can include questionnaires and interviews, which are also designed to measure unobserved constructs. Questionnaire- and interview-based scales typically differ from psychoeducational tests, which ask for a respondent's maximum performance. Questionnaire- and interview-based scales, by contrast, ask for the respondent's typical behavior.Mellenbergh, G.J. (2008). Chapter 10: Surveys. In H.J. Ad√®r & G.J. Mellenbergh (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183-209). Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing. Symptom and attitude tests are more often called scales. A useful psychological test/scale must be both valid (i.e., there is evidence to support the idea that the test or scale measures what it is purported to measure and \\"how well it does so\\"American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education. (1999). Standards for educational and psychological testing. Washington, DC: American Educational Research Association.) and reliable (i.e., internally consistent or give consistent results over time, across raters, etc.). It is important that people who are equal on the measured construct (e.g., mathematics ability, depression) have an approximately equal probability of answering a test item accurately or acknowledging the presence of a symptom. An example of an item on a mathematics test that might be used in the United Kingdom but not the United States could be the following: \\"In a football match two players get a red card; how many players are left on the pitch?\\" This item requires knowledge of football (soccer) to be answered correctly, not just mathematical ability. Thus, group membership can influence the chance of correctly answering items, as encapsulated in the concept of differential item functioning. Often tests are constructed for a specific population and the nature of that population should be taken into account when administering tests outside that population. If a test is invariant to one population (e.g. schoolchildren in the United Kingdom) it does not automatically mean that the test functions in much the same way in another population (e.g. schoolchildren in the United States). Psychological assessment is similar to psychological testing but usually involves a more comprehensive assessment of the individual. Psychological assessment is a process that involves checking the integration of information from multiple sources, such as tests of normal and abnormal personality, tests of ability or intelligence, tests of interests or attitudes, as well as information from personal interviews. Collateral information is also collected about personal, occupational, or medical history, such as from records or from interviews with parents, spouses, teachers, or previous therapists or physicians. A psychological test is one of the sources of data used within the process of assessment; usually more than one test is used. Many psychologists do some level of assessment when providing services to clients or patients, and may use for example, simple checklists to assess some traits or symptoms, but psychological assessment is a more complex, detailed, in-depth process. Typical types of focus for psychological assessment are to provide a diagnosis; to assess a particular area of functioning or disability often for school settings; to help select type of treatment or to assess treatment outcomes; to help courts decide issues such as child custody or competency to stand trial; or to help assess job applicants or employees and provide career development counseling or training. History A Song Dynasty painting of candidates participating in the imperial examination, a rudimentary form of psychological testing. Physiognomy was used to assess personality traits based on an individual's outer appearance. The first large-scale tests may have been examinations that were part of the imperial examination system in China. The test, an early form of psychological testing, assessed candidates based on their proficiency in topics such as civil law and fiscal policies. Other early tests of intelligence were made for entertainment rather than analysis. Modern mental testing began in France in the 19th century. It contributed to separating mental retardation from mental illness and reducing the neglect, torture, and ridicule heaped on both groups. Englishman Francis Galton coined the terms psychometrics and eugenics, and developed a method for measuring intelligence based on nonverbal sensory-motor tests. It was initially popular, but was abandoned after the discovery that it had no relationship to outcomes such as college grades. French psychologist Alfred Binet, together with psychologists Victor Henri and Th√©odore Simon, after about 15 years of development, published the Binet-Simon test in 1905, which focused on verbal abilities. It was intended to identify mental retardation in school children. The origins of personality testing date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through phrenology, the measurement of the human skull, and physiognomy, which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances. These early pseudoscientific techniques were eventually replaced with more empirical methods in the 20th century. One of the earliest modern personality tests was the Woolworth Personality Data Sheet, a self-report inventory developed for World War I and used for the psychiatric screening of new draftees. Principles Proper psychological testing is conducted after vigorous research and development in contrast to quick web-based or magazine questionnaires that say \\"Find out your Personality Color,\\" or \\"What's your Inner Age?\\" Proper psychological testing consists of the following: :* Standardization - All procedures and steps must be conducted with consistency and under the same environment to achieve the same testing performance from those being tested. :* Objectivity - Scoring such that subjective judgments and biases are minimized, with results for each test taker obtained in the same way. :* Test Norms - The average test score within a large group of people where the performance of one individual can be compared to the results of others by establishing a point of comparison or frame of reference. :* Reliability - Obtaining the same result after multiple testing. :* Validity - The type of test being administered must measure what it is intended to measure. = Sample of behavior = The term sample of behavior refers to an individual's performance on tasks that have usually been prescribed beforehand. The samples of behavior that make up a paper-and-pencil test, the most common type of psychological test, are a series of test items. Performance on these items produce a test score. A score on a well-constructed test is believed to reflect a psychological construct such as achievement in a school subject like mathematics knowledge, cognitive ability, aptitude, emotional functioning, personality, etc. Differences in test scores are thought to reflect individual differences in the construct the test is purported to measure. Types There are several broad categories of psychological tests: = Achievement tests = Achievement tests are tests that assess an individual's knowledge in a subject domain. Academic achievement tests are designed to be administered by a trained evaluator to an individual or a group of people. During achievement tests, a series of test items is presented to the person being evaluated. A score on a test is believed to reflect achievement in a school subject. Many achievement tests are norm-referenced. The person's responses are scored according to standardized protocols and the results can be compared to the responses of a norming group after the test is completed. Some achievement tests are criterion referenced, the purpose of which is find out if the test-taker mastered a predetermined body of knowledge rather than to compare the test- taker to everyone else who is taking the test. The Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement is an example of an individually administered achievement test for students.Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement  Third Edition = Aptitude tests = Psychological tests have been designed to measure specific abilities, such as clerical, perceptual, numerical, or spatial aptitude. Sometimes these tests must be specially designed for a particular job, but there are also tests available that measure general clerical and mechanical aptitudes, or even general learning ability. An example of an occupational aptitude test is the Minnesota Clerical Test, which measures the perceptual speed and accuracy required to perform various clerical duties. A widely used aptitude test in business is the Wonderlic Test. There are aptitudes that are believed to be related to specific occupations and are used for career guidance as well as selection and recruitment. Evidence suggests that aptitude tests like IQ tests are sensitive to past learning and cannot avoid measuring past achievement, although they were once thought to measure untutored ability.Ceci, S. J. (1991). How much does schooling influence general intelligence and its cognitive components? A reassessment of the evidence. Developmental Psychology, 27, 703‚Äì722. https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.27.5.703 The SAT, which used to be called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, had its named changed because performance on the test is sensitive to training.Lemann, N. (1999). The big test: The secret history of the American meritocracy. New York: Farrar, Strauss and Giroux. = Attitude scales = An attitude scale assesses an individual's disposition regarding an event (e.g., a Supreme Court decision), person (e.g., a governor), concept (e.g., wearing face masks during a pandemic), organization (e.g., the Boy Scouts), or object (e.g., nuclear weapons) on a unidimensional favorable-unfavorable attitude continuum. Attitude scales are used in marketing to determine individuals' preferences for brands. Historically social psychologists have developed attitude scales to assess individuals' attitudes toward the United Nations and race relations.Brown, R. (1965). Social psychology. New York: The Free Press. Typically Likert scales are used in attitude research. Historically, the Thurstone scale was used prior to the development of the Likert scale. The Likert scale has largely supplanted the Thurstone scale. = Biographical Information Blank = The Biographical Information Blanks or BIB is a paper-and-pencil form that includes items that ask about detailed personal and work history. It is used to aid in the hiring of employees by matching the backgrounds of individuals to requirements of the job. = Clinical tests = The purpose of clinical tests is assess the presence of symptoms of psychopathology . Examples of clinical assessments include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-IV,Millon, T. (1994). Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III. Minneapolis, MN: National Computer Systems. Child Behavior Checklist, Symptom Checklist 90Derogatis L. R. (1983). SCL90: Administration, Scoring and Procedures Manual for the Revised Version. Baltimore: Clinical Psychometric Research. and the Beck Depression Inventory. Clinical tests like the MMPI are also norm-referenced, with 50 the middlemost score on a symptom subscale such as the Depression scale and 60 a score that places the individual one standard deviation above the mean for the symptom scale. = Criterion-referenced = A criterion-referenced test is an achievement test in a specific knowledge domain. An individual's performance on the test is compared to a criterion. Test-takers are not compared to each other. A passing score, i.e., the criterion performance, is established by the teacher or an educational institution. Criterion-referenced tests are part and parcel of mastery based education. =Direct observation= Psychological assessment can involve the observation of people as they complete activities. This type of assessment is usually conducted with families in a laboratory or at home. Sometimes the observation can involve children in a classroom or the schoolyard.Reid, J. B., Eddy, J. M., Fetrow, R. A., & Stoolmiller, M. (1999). Description and immediate impacts of a preventive intervention for conduct problems. American Journal of Community Psychology, 27, 483‚Äì517. The purpose may be clinical, such as to establish a pre-intervention baseline of a child's hyperactive or aggressive classroom behaviors or to observe the nature of a parent-child interaction in order to understand a relational disorder.Waters, E., & Deane, K.E. (1985). Defining and assessing individual differences in attachment relationships: Q-methodology and the organization of behavior in infancy and early childhood (pp. 41-65)Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50, 41-65. Time sampling methods are also part of direct observational research. The reliability of observers in direct observational research can be evaluated using Cohen's kappa. The Parent-Child Interaction Assessment-II (PCIA) is an example of a direct observation procedure that is used with school-age children and parents. The parents and children are video recorded playing at a make-believe zoo. The Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment is used to study parents and young children and involves a feeding and a puzzle task. The MacArthur Story Stem Battery (MSSB)Bretherton, I., Oppenheim, D., Buchsbaum, H., Emde, R. N., & the MacArthur Narrative Group. (1990). MacArthur Story-Stem battery. Unpublished manual. is used to elicit narratives from children. The Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-II tracks the extent to which children follow the commands of parents and vice versa and is well suited to the study of children with Oppositional Defiant Disorders and their parents. = Interest inventories = Psychological tests include interest inventories. These tests are used primarily for career counseling. Interest inventories include items that ask about the preferred activities and interests of people seeking career counseling. The rationale is that if the individual's of activities and interests is similar to the modal pattern for people who are successful in a given occupation, then the chances are high that the individual would find satisfaction in that occupation. A widely used interest test is the Strong Interest Inventory, which is used in career assessment, career counseling, and educational guidance. = Neuropsychological tests = Neuropsychological tests are designed to be an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior. = Norm- referenced tests = Items on norm-referenced tests have been tried out on a norming group and scores on the test can be classified as high, medium, or low and the gradations in between. These tests allow for the study of individual differences. Scores on norm-referenced achievement tests are associated with percentile ranks vis-√°-vis other individuals who are the test-taker's age or grade. = Personality tests = Personality tests assess constructs that are thought to be the constituents of personality. Examples of personality constructs include traits in the Big Five, such as introversion-extroversion and conscientiousness. Personality constructs are thought to be dimensional. Personality measures are used in research and in the selection of employees. They include self-report and observer-report scales.Ashton, M. C., (2017). Individual Differences and Personality (3rd ed.). Amsterdam: Elsevier. Examples of norm-referenced personality tests include the NEO-PI, the 16PF, the OPQ, and the FFPI-C. The IPIP scales are assess the same personality traits that the NEO and the other scales assess but IPIP scales and items are available free of charge.International Personality Item Pool. Accessed July 14, 2020 = Projective tests = Projective testing originated in the first half of the 1900s. Examples of projective tests are story-telling, drawings, or sentence-completion tasks. = Public safety employment tests = Vocations within the public safety field (i.e., fire service, law enforcement, corrections, emergency medical services) often require Industrial and Organizational Psychology tests for initial employment and advancement throughout the ranks. The National Firefighter Selection Inventory - NFSI, the National Criminal Justice Officer Selection Inventory - NCJOSI, and the Integrity Inventory are prominent examples of these tests. Test security Many psychological and psychoeducational tests are not available to the public. Test publishers put restrictions on who has access to the test. Psychology licensing boards also restrict access to the tests used in licensing psychologists. Test publishers hold that both copyright and professional ethics require them to protect the tests. Publishers sell tests only to people who have proved their educational and professional qualifications. Purchasers are legally bound not to give test answers or the tests themselves to members of the public unless permitted by the publisher. The International Test Commission (ITC), an international association of national psychological societies and test publishers, publishes the International Guidelines for Test Use, which prescribes measures to take to \\"protect the integrity\\" of the tests by not publicly describing test techniques and by not \\"coaching individuals\\" so that they \\"might unfairly influence their test performance.\\"International Test Commission (2000) International Guidelines for Test Use  See also  References External links *American Psychological Association webpage on testing and assessment *British Psychological Society Psychological Testing Centre *Guidelines of the International Test Commission *List of Common Psychological Tests * International Item Pool, an alternative and free source of items available for research on personality Clinical psychology ","title":"Psychological testing"},{"id":"176856","text":"Parthian Warrior The Parni (; , Parnoi) or Aparni (; ·ºåœÄŒ±œÅŒΩŒøŒπ, Aparnoi) were an East Iranian peopleEncyclopedia Iranica : \\"APARNA (Gk. Aparnoi/Parnoi, Lat. Aparni or Parni), an east Iranian tribe established on the Ochos (modern Ta«∞en, Te«∞end) and one of the three tribes in the confederation of the Dahae. who lived around the Ochus. ( Okhos) (Tejen) River, southeast of the Caspian Sea. It is believed that their original homeland may have been southern Russia from where they emigrated with other Scythian tribes. The Parni were one of the three tribes of the Dahae confederacy. In the middle of the 3rd century BCE, the Parni invaded Parthia, \\"drove away the Greek satraps, who had then only just acquired independence, and founded a new dynasty\\",. that of the Arsacids. Historical identity and location There is no unambiguous evidence of the Parni in native Iranian language sources,cf. and all references to these people comes from Greek and Latin accounts. In these accounts, which are not necessarily contemporaneous, it is difficult to unambiguously identify references to the Parni due to inconsistency of Greek/Latin naming and transliteration, and/or the similarity to names of other tribes such as the Sparni or Apartani and the Eparnoi or Asparioi. It may also be that the Parni are related to one or more of these other tribes, and that \\"their original homeland may have been southern Russia from where they emigrated with other Scythian tribes.\\" The location of the Parni Dahae immediately south-east of the Caspian Sea was derived from by Strabo's Geographica (Book 11, 1st century BCE). The ethnonym of the Dahae was the root of the later placename Dahestan or Dihistan ‚Äì a region straddling the present regions of Turkmenistan and Iran. So little is known of the Dahae, including the Parni, that ‚Äì in the words of A. D. H. Bivar ‚Äì even the location and name of their capital city \\"if indeed they possessed one\\" is now unknown.. A later archaeological site in the region, known as Dehistan/Mishrian, is located in the Balkan Region of Turkmenistan. Language The language of the Parni is not directly attested but is assumed to be one of the eastern substrates of the subsequently recorded Parthian language, which the Parni eventually adopted. To the \\"incoming Parni may be ascribed a form of speech showing a strong east Iranian element, resulting from their proximity on the steppe to east Iranian Sakas.\\" Through the influence of the Parthians in Armenia, traces of the Parni language survive as \\"loan-words in Armenian.\\" The language of the Parni \\"was described by Justin as 'midway between Scythian and Median [and] contained features of both'\\". (41.1.10). Justin's late (3rd century) opinion is \\"no doubt slightly exaggerated,\\" and is in any case of questionable veracity given the ambiguity of names. Rise to prominence In 247 BCE, Andragoras, the Seleucid governor (satrap) of Parthia (\\"roughly western Khurasan\\".) proclaimed independence from the Seleucids, when‚Äîfollowing the death of Antiochus II‚ÄîPtolemy III seized control of the Seleucid capital at Antioch, and \\"so left the future of the Seleucid dynasty for a moment in question.\\". Meanwhile, \\"a man called Arsaces, of Scythian or Bactrian origin, [was] elected leader of the Parni tribes.\\" Following the secession of Parthia from the Seleucid Empire and the resultant loss of Seleucid military support, Andragoras had difficulty in maintaining his borders, and about 238 BCE‚Äîunder the command of \\"Arsaces and his brother Tiridates\\".‚Äîthe Parni invaded. Parthia and seized control of Astabene (Astawa), the northern region of that territory, the administrative capital of which was Kabuchan (Kuchan in the vulgate). A short while later, the Parni seized the rest of Parthia from Andragoras, killing him in the process. Although an initial punitive expedition by the Seleucids under Seleucus II was not successful, the Seleucids under Antiochus III recaptured Arsacid-controlled territory following the Battle of Mount Labus in 209 BCE from Arsaces' (or Tiridates') successor, Arsaces II. Arsaces II sued for peace and accepted vassal status, and it was not until Arsaces II's grandson (or grand-nephew) Phraates I, that the Arsacids/Parni would again begin to assert their independence.. For the historiographers upon whose documentation the reconstruction of early Arsacid history depends, the Parni had by then become indistinguishable from the Parthians. Legacy The seizure of Astabene in 238 BCE nominally marks the beginning of the Arsacid era, which is named after Arsaces, and the name adopted by all Parthian kings. The Arsacid dynasts laid claim to descent from Artaxerxes II. Beginning from Astabene and Parthia (which would subsequently be extended southwards to include much of present-day Sistan), the Arsacids gradually subjugated many of the neighboring kingdoms, most of which were thereafter controlled as vassalries. Beginning with the successful revolt - in 224 CE - of an erstwhile vassal of Stakhr named Ardashir (in Greek again \\"Arsaces\\"/\\"Artaxerxes\\".), the Arsacid/Parthian hegemony began to yield to a Sassanid/Persian one. The name \\"Parni\\" reappears in Sassanid-era documents to identify one of the seven Parthian feudal families allied with the Sassanid court. However, this family is not attested from Arsacid times, and the claim to the \\"Parni\\" name is (like four of the six other families) \\"in all probability not in accordance with reality.\\" \\"It may be that [...] members of them made up their own genealogies in order to emphasize the antiquity of their families.\\". It has been suggested. that the Parnau Hills (Paran Koh) bear the name of the Parni. Notes * a Arsaces was \\"perhaps originally a local ruler in Bactria.\\" * b The origins of the Arsacids lineage are based on the historiography of later Greeks and Romans; the fact remains that the Arsacids used Greek titles and Greek inscriptions on their coins, which were also styled after the Seleucid coins. While Wolski (1937/1938) supported that the story of the two brothers may even be fiction, their coins are real, and they are considered to be historical personae and that Tiridates (I) succeeded his brother Arsaces (I), although he took on the Arsaces name at his coronation, a not-unusual practice in that era. Some have also questioned the relationship between Tiridates I (a.k.a. Arsaces II) and his son and successor Arsaces II (a.k.a. Artabanus I). For example, Bivar has rejected the genealogies proposed by Frye and Chaumont & Bickermann. * cIn linguistics and philology, the expression 'Parnian' is sometimes used as a term of convenience to collectively denote eastern Iranian influences evident in the (western Iranian) Parthian language. Because the language of the Parni is not actually attested, it is not possible to determine whether there is actually a specific correlation between the language of the Parni and that of the east Iranian element in Parthian.

He was born in Dunsfold, Surrey, England, but his family soon moved to Hampshire, where his father, the Reverend Thomas Warton, became vicar of Basingstoke. There, a few years later, Joseph's younger brother, the more famous Thomas Warton, was born. Their father later became an Oxford professor. Joseph was educated at Winchester College and at Oriel College, Oxford, and followed his father into the church, becoming curate of Winslade in 1748. In 1754, he was instituted as rector at The Church of All Saints, Tunworth.William Page (editor) Tunworth 'Parishes: Tunworth', A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 4 (1911), pp. 174‚Äì176. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56773 Date accessed: 8 July 2010. In his early days Joseph wrote poetry, of which the most notable piece is The Enthusiast (1744), an early precursor of Romanticism. In 1755, he returned to his old school to teach, and from 1766 to 1793 was its headmaster, but it was a role in which he did not distinguish himself. His career as a critic was always more illustrious, and he produced editions of classical poets such as Virgil as well as English poets including John Dryden. Like his brother, he was a friend of Samuel Johnson, and formed part of the literary coterie centered on the publisher Robert Dodsley.

His first immigrant ancestor was the English colonist Nicholas Camp, who came from Nazeing, Essex, England and arrived in colonial New England in 1630, arriving first in Massachusetts and then moving to Connecticut that same year. Walter attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, entered Yale College in 1875, and graduated in 1880. At Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, the Linonian Society, and Skull and Bones. He attended Yale Medical School from 1880 to 1883, where his studies were interrupted first by an outbreak of typhoid fever and then by work for the Manhattan Watch Company. =Playing career= In 1873 Camp attended a meeting where representatives from Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton, and Yale universities created the Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA). The representatives created the rule that each team is only allowed 15 plays per drive. Camp played as a halfback at Yale from 1876 to 1882. Harvard player Nathaniel Curtis took one look at Camp, then only 156 pounds, and told Yale captain Gene Baker \\"You don't mean to let that child play, do you? ... He will get hurt.\\" Camp worked for the New Haven Clock Company beginning in 1883, working his way up to chairman of the board of directors. =Family= On June 30, 1888, Camp married Alice Graham Sumner, sister of sociologist William Graham Sumner. They had two children: Walter Camp, Jr. (born 1891), who attended Yale as well and was elected as a member of Scroll and Key in 1912, and Janet Camp Troxell (born 1897). =Coaching career= Camp served as the head football coach at Yale from 1888 to 1892. In his time with Yale, the team won 67 games and lost just 2 games. He then moved on to Stanford University, where he coached in December 1892 and in 1894 and 1895. On Christmas Day, 1894, Amos Alonzo Stagg and his University of Chicago Maroons defeated Camp's Stanford team 24‚Äì4 at San Francisco in an early intersectional contest. Father of American football Camp was on the various collegiate football rules committees that developed the American game from his time as a player at Yale until his death. English rugby football rules at the time required a tackled player, when the ball was \\"fairly held,\\" to put the ball down immediately for scrummage. Camp proposed at the U.S. College Football 1880 rules convention that the contested scrimmage be replaced with a \\"line of scrimmage\\" where the team with the ball started with uncontested possession. This change effectively created the evolution of the modern game of American football from its rugby football origins. He is credited with innovations such as the snap-back from center, the system of downs, and the points system as well as the introduction of what became a standard offensive arrangement of players‚Äîa seven-man line and a four-man backfield consisting of a quarterback, two halfbacks, and a fullback. Camp was also responsible for introducing the \\"safety,\\" the awarding of two points to the defensive side for tackling a ball carrier in his own end zone followed by a free kick by the offense from its own 20-yard line to restart play. This is significant as rugby union has no point value award for this action, but instead awards a scrum to the attacking side five meters from the goal line. In 2011, reviewing Camp's role in the founding of the sport and of the NCAA, Taylor Branch also credited Camp with cutting the number of players on a football team from 15 to 11 and adding measuring lines to the field. However, Branch noted that the revelation in a contemporaneous McClure's magazine story of \\"Camp's $100,000 slush fund,\\" along with concern about the violence of the growing sport, helped lead to President Theodore Roosevelt's intervention in the sport. The NCAA emerged from the national talks, but worked to Yale's disadvantage relative to rival (and Roosevelt's alma mater) Harvard, according to Branch.Branch, Taylor, \\"The Shame of College Sports,\\" The Atlantic, September 14, 2011 (October 2011 issue). In 1905 in McClure's, Henry Beach Needham published two stories, \\"The College Athlete: His Amateur Code: Its Evasion and Administration.\\" (July; 25:3 p. 260) and \\"The College Athlete: How Commercialism Is Making Him a Professional\\" (June; 25:2) with Yale content per \\"The early history of football at Yale: Contemporary sources\\" , Critical Sport Studies. Retrieved 2011-09-27. Writing Despite having a full-time job at the New Haven Clock Company, a Camp family business, and being an unpaid yet very involved adviser to the Yale football team, Camp wrote articles and books on the gridiron and sports in general. By the time of his death, he had written nearly 30 books and more than 250 magazine articles. His articles appeared in national periodicals such as Harper's Weekly, Collier's, Outing, Outlook, and The Independent, and in juvenile magazines such as St. Nicholas, Youth's Companion, and Boys' Magazine. His stories also appeared in major daily newspapers throughout the United States. He also selected an annual \\"All- American\\" team. By the age of 33, twelve years after graduating from Yale, Walter Camp had already become known as the \\"Father of Football.\\" In a column in the popular magazine Harper's Weekly, sports columnist Caspar Whitney had applied the nickname; the sobriquet was appropriate because, by 1892, Camp had almost single-handedly fashioned the game of modern American football. =Eastern bias= The dominance of Ivy League players on Camp's All-America teams led to criticism over the years that his selections were biased against players from the leading Western universities, including Chicago, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Notre Dame. Many selectors picked only Eastern players. For example, Wilton S. Farnsworth's 1910 All-American eleven for the New York Evening Journal was made up of five players from Harvard, two from West Point, and one each from Yale, Princeton, Penn, and Brown. The selectors were typically Eastern writers and former players who attended only games in the East. In December 1910, The Mansfield News, an Ohio newspaper, ran an article headlined: \\"All-American Teams of East Are Jokes: Critics Who Never Saw Western Teams Play to Name Best in Country -- Forget About Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois.\\" The article noted: The Daily Dozen exercise regimen Camp was a proponent of exercise, and not just for the athletes he coached. While working as an adviser to the United States military during World War I, he devised a program to help servicemen become more physically fit. > Walter Camp has just developed for the Naval of setting up exercises that > seems to fill the bill; a system designed to give a man a running jump start > for the serious work of the day.

As the name indicates, there were twelve exercises, and they could be completed in about eight minutes.\\"Camp's Daily Dozen Exercises\\", Boston Globe, July 11, 1920, p. 64 A prolific writer, Camp wrote a book explaining the exercises and extolling their benefits.

SƒÅi; Egyptian: , ) were a group of nomadic Iranian peoples who historically inhabited the northern and eastern Eurasian Steppe and the Tarim Basin. \\"Modern scholars have mostly used the name Saka to refer to Iranians of the Eastern Steppe and Tarim Basin\\" \\"In modern scholarship the name 'Sakas' is reserved for the ancient tribes of northern and eastern Central Asia and Eastern Turkestan to distinguish them from the related Massagetae of the Aral region and the Scythians of the Pontic steppes. These tribes spoke Iranian languages, and their chief occupation was nomadic pastoralism.\\" Though closely related, the Sakas are to be distinguished from the Scythians of the Pontic Steppe and the Massagetae of the Aral Sea region, \\"Horse-riding nomadism has been referred to as the culture of 'Early Nomads'. This term encompasses different ethnic groups (such as Scythians, Saka, Massagetae, and Yuezhi)...\\" although they form part of the wider Scythian cultures. Like the Scythians, the Sakas were ultimately derived from the earlier Andronovo culture. Their language formed part of the Scythian languages. Prominent archaeological remains of the Sakas include Arzhan, Tunnug, the Pazyryk burials, the Issyk kurgan, Saka Kurgan tombs, the Barrows of Tasmola and possibly Tillya Tepe. In the 2nd century BC, many Sakas were driven by the Yuezhi from the steppe into Sogdia and Bactria and then to the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, where they were known as the Indo- Scythians. \\"The Saka, or ≈öaka, people then began their long migration that ended with their conquest of northern India, where they are also known as the Indo-Scythians.\\" Other Sakas invaded the Parthian Empire, eventually settling in Sistan, while others may have migrated to the Dian Kingdom in Yunnan, China. In the Tarim Basin and Taklamakan Desert region of Northwest China, they settled in Khotan, Yarkand, Kashgar and other places, which were at various times vassals to greater powers, such as Han China and Tang China. Usage of name Modern debate about the identity of the \\"Saka\\" is partly from ambiguous usage of the word by ancient, non-Saka authorities. According to Herodotus, the Persians gave the name \\"Saka\\" to all \\"Scythians\\".Herodotus Book VII, 64 However, Pliny the Elder (Gaius Plinius Secundus, AD 23‚Äì79) claims that the Persians gave the name Sakai only to the Scythian tribes \\"nearest to them\\".Naturalis Historia, VI, 19, 50 The Scythians to the far north of Assyria were also called the Saka suni (Saka or Scythian sons) by the Persians. The Neo-Assyrian Empire of the time of Esarhaddon record campaigning against a people they called in the Akkadian language the Ashkuza or Ishhuza. Another people, the Gimirrai, who were known to the ancient Greeks as the Cimmerians, were closely associated with the Sakas. In Biblical Hebrew, the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the Gimirri (Gomer).\\"The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath,[a] and Togarmah.\\" See also the entry for Ashkenaz in Achaemenids, there were three types of Sakas: the SakƒÅ tayai paradraya (\\"beyond the sea\\", presumably between the Greeks and the Thracians on the Western side of the Black Sea), the SakƒÅ tigraxaudƒÅ (‚Äúwith pointed caps‚Äù), the SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ (\\"Hauma drinkers\\", furthest East). Soldiers of the Achaemenid army, Xerxes I tomb detail, circa 480 BC. The Saka were regarded by the Babylonians as synonymous with the Gimirrai; both names are used on the trilingual Behistun Inscription, carved in 515 BCE on the order of Darius the Great,George Rawlinson, noted in his translation of History of Herodotus, Book VII, p. 378 These people were reported to be mainly interested in settling in the kingdom of Urartu, later part of Armenia, and Shacusen in Utik derived its name from them.) The Behistun Inscription initially only gave one entry for Saka, they were however further differentiated later into three groups: * the SakƒÅ paradraya ‚Äì \\"Saka beyond the sea\\", a name added after the Scythian campaign of Darius I north of the Danube. * the SakƒÅ tigraxaudƒÅ ‚Äì \\"Saka with pointy hats/caps\\" * the SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ ‚Äì interpreted as \\"haoma-drinking Saka\\", but there are other suggestions. An additional term is found in two inscriptions elsewhere: * the SakƒÅ para Sugdam ‚Äì \\"Saka beyond Sugda (Sogdia)\\", a term was used by Darius for the people who formed the limits of his empire at the opposite end to the Kingdom of Kush (the Ethiopians), therefore should be located at the eastern edge of his empire. The SakƒÅ paradraya refers to the western Scythians (European Scythians) or Sarmatians. Both the SakƒÅ tigraxaudƒÅ and SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ are thought to be located in Central Asia east of the Caspian Sea. SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ is considered to be the same as Amyrgians, the Saka tribe in closest proximity to Bactria and Sogdia. It has been suggested that the SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ may be the SakƒÅ para Sugdam, therefore SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ is argued by some to be located further east than the SakƒÅ tigraxaudƒÅ, perhaps at the Pamir Mountains or Xinjiang, although Syr Darya is considered to be their more likely location given that the name says \\"beyond Sogdia\\" rather than Bactria. In the modern era, the archaeologist Hugo Winckler (1863-1913) was the first to associate the Sakas with the Scythians. John Manuel Cook, in The Cambridge History of Iran, states: \\"The Persians gave the single name SakƒÅ both to the nomads whom they encountered between the Hungry Steppe (Mirzacho'l) and the Caspian, and equally to those north of the Danube and Black Sea against whom Darius later campaigned; and the Greeks and Assyrians called all those who were known to them by the name Skuthai (I≈°kuzai). SakƒÅ and Skuthai evidently constituted a generic name for the nomads on the northern frontiers.\\" Persian sources often treat them as a single tribe called the Saka (Sakai or Sakas), but Greek and Latin texts suggest that the Scythians were composed of many sub-groups.Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland-page-323 Modern scholars now usually use the term Saka to refer to Iranian peoples who inhabited the northern and eastern Eurasian Steppe and the Tarim Basin. History Artifacts found the tombs 2 and 4 of Tillya Tepe and reconstitution of their use on the man and woman found in these tombs =Origins= The Sakas were a group of Iranic peoples who spoke a language belonging to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages. French historian Ren√© Grousset wrote that they formed a particular branch of the \\"Scytho-Sarmatian family\\" originating from nomadic Iranian peoples of the northwestern steppe in Eurasia. Like the Scythians of the Pontic Steppe, to whom they were related, the Saka were racially Europoid and ultimately traced their origin to the Andronovo culture. \\"The physical type of this group, distinctly Mongoloid, is also very different from the Europoid \\"Saka\\" people of the Altai.\\" The Pazyryk burials of the Pazyryk culture in the Ukok Plateau in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC are thought to be of Saka chieftains. \\"The rich kurgan burials in Pazyryk, Siberia probably were those of Saka chieftains\\" \\"Analysis of the clothing, which has analogies in the complex of Saka clothes, particularly in Pazyryk, led Wang Binghua (1987, 42) to the conclusion that they are related to the Saka Culture.\\" \\"The dress of Iranian-speaking Saka and Scythians is easily reconstructed on the basis of... numerous archaeological discoveries from the Ukraine to the Altai, particularly at Issyk in Kazakhstan... at Pazyryk... and Ak-Alakha\\" These burials show striking similarities with the earlier Tarim mummies at Gumugou. The Issyk kurgan of south-eastern Kazakhstan, and the Ordos culture of the Ordos Plateau has also been connected with the Saka. It has been suggested that the ruling elite of the Xiongnu was of Saka origin. \\"Their royal tribes and kings (shan-yii) bore Iranian names and all the Hsiung-nu words noted by the Chinese can be explained from an Iranian language of Saka type. It is therefore clear that the majority of Hsiung-nu tribes spoke an Eastern Iranian language.\\" Some scholars contend that in the 8th century BC, a Saka raid on Altai may be \\"connected\\" with a raid on Zhou China. =Early history= The Saka are attested in historical and archaeological records dating to around the 8th century BC. In the Achaemenid-era Old Persian inscriptions found at Persepolis, dated to the reign of Darius I (r. 522-486 BC), the Saka are said to have lived just beyond the borders of Sogdia. Likewise an inscription dated to the reign of Xerxes I (r. 486-465 BC) has them coupled with the Dahae people of Central Asia. Two Saka tribes named in the Behistun Inscription, SakƒÅ tigraxaudƒÅ (\\"Saka with pointy hats/caps\\") and the SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ (\\"haoma-drinking saka\\"), may be located to the east of the Caspian Sea. Some argued that the SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ may be the SakƒÅ para Sugdam, therefore SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ would be located further east than the SakƒÅ tigraxaudƒÅ. Some argued for the Pamirs or Xinjiang as their location, although Jaxartes is considered to be their more likely location given that the name says \\"beyond Sogdiana\\" rather than Bactria. The contemporary Greek historian Herodotus noted that the Achaemenid Empire called all of the \\"Scythians\\" by the name \\"Saka\\". Greek historians wrote of the wars between the Saka and the Medes, as well as their wars against Cyrus the Great of the Persian Achaemenid Empire where Saka women were said to fight alongside their men. According to Herodotus, Cyrus the Great confronted the Massagetae, a people related to the Saka, while campaigning to the east of the Caspian Sea and was killed in the battle in 530 BC. Darius I also waged wars against the eastern Sakas, who fought him with three armies led by three kings according to Polyaenus. In 520‚Äì519 BC, Darius I defeated the SakƒÅ tigraxaudƒÅ tribe and captured their king Skunkha (depicted as wearing a pointed hat in Behistun). The territories of Saka were absorbed into the Achaemenid Empire as part of Chorasmia that included much of the Amu Darya (Oxus) and the Syr Darya (Jaxartes), and the Saka then supplied the Achaemenid army with large number of mounted bowmen. They were also mentioned as among those who resisted Alexander the Great's incursions into Central Asia. The Saka were known as the Sak or Sai () in ancient Chinese records.\\"The ethnonym Saka appears in ancient Iranian and Indian sources as the name of the large family of Iranian nomads called Scythians by the Classical Western sources and Sai by the Chinese (Gk. Sacae; OPers. SakƒÅ).\\" These records indicate that they originally inhabited the Ili and Chu River valleys of modern Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. In the Book of Han, the area was called the \\"land of the Sak\\", i.e. the Saka. The exact date of the Sakas' arrival in the valleys of the Ili and Chu in Central Asia is unclear, perhaps it was just before the reign of Darius I. Around 30 Saka tombs in the form of kurgans (burial mounds) have also been found in the Tian Shan area dated to between 550‚Äì250 BC. Indications of Saka presence have also been found in the Tarim Basin region, possibly as early as the 7th century BC. At least by the late 2nd century BC, the Sakas had founded states in the Tarim Barin. =Migrations= Captured Saka king Skunkha, from Mount Behistun, Iran, Achaemenid stone relief from the reign of Darius I (r. 522‚Äì486 BC) The Saka were pushed out of the Ili and Chu River valleys by the Yuezhi. An account of the movement of these people is given in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian. The Yuehzhi, who originally lived between T√§ngri Tagh (Tian Shan) and Dunhuang of Gansu, China, were assaulted and forced to flee from the Hexi Corridor of Gansu by the forces of the Xiongnu ruler Modu Chanyu, who conquered the area in 177‚Äì176 BC.Torday, Laszlo.

In turn the Yuehzhi were responsible for attacking and pushing the Sai (i.e. Saka) west into Sogdiana, where, between 140 and 130 BCE, the latter crossed the Syr Darya into Bactria. The Saka also moved southwards toward the Pamirs and northern India, where they settled in Kashmir, and eastward, to settle in some of the oasis-states of Tarim Basin sites, like Yanqi (ÁÑâËÄÜ, Karasahr) and Qiuci (ÈæúËå≤, Kucha).Yu Taishan (June 2010), \\"The Earliest Tocharians in China\\" in Victor H. Mair (ed), Sino-Platonic Papers, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, University of Pennsylvania Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, pp. 13‚Äì14, 21‚Äì22. The Yuehzhi, themselves under attacks from another nomadic tribe, the Wusun, in 133‚Äì132 BC, moved, again, from the Ili and Chu valleys, and occupied the country of Daxia, (Â§ßÂ§è, \\"Bactria\\").Yu Taishan (June 2010), \\"The Earliest Tocharians in China\\" in Victor H.

The ancient Greco-Roman geographer Strabo noted that the four tribes that took down the Bactrians in the Greek and Roman account ‚Äì the Asioi, Pasianoi, Tokharoi and Sakaraulai ‚Äì came from land north of the Syr Darya where the Ili and Chu valleys are located. Identification of these four tribes varies, but Sakaraulai may indicate an ancient Saka tribe, the Tokharoi is possibly the Yuezhi, and while the Asioi had been proposed to be groups such as the Wusun or Alans. Ren√© Grousset wrote of the migration of the Saka: \\"the Saka, under pressure from the Yueh-chih [Yuezhi], overran Sogdiana and then Bactria, there taking the place of the Greeks.\\" Then, \\"Thrust back in the south by the Yueh-chih,\\" the Saka occupied \\"the Saka country, Sakastana, whence the modern Persian Seistan.\\" Some of the Saka fleeing the Yuezhi attacked the Parthian Empire, where they defeated and killed the kings Phraates II and Artabanus. These Sakas were eventually settled by Mithridates II in what become known as Sakastan. According to Harold Walter Bailey, the territory of Drangiana (now in Afghanistan and Pakistan) became known as \\"Land of the Sakas\\", and was called SakastƒÅna in the Persian language of contemporary Iran, in Armenian as Sakastan, with similar equivalents in Pahlavi, Greek, Sogdian, Syriac, Arabic, and the Middle Persian tongue used in Turfan, Xinjiang, China. This is attested in a contemporary Kharosthi inscription found on the Mathura lion capital belonging to the Saka kingdom of the Indo-Scythians (200 BC ‚Äì 400 AD) in North India, roughly the same time the Chinese record that the Saka had invaded and settled the country of Jibin ÁΩΩË≥ì (i.e. Kashmir, of modern-day India and Pakistan).Ulrich Theobald. (26 November 2011). \\"Chinese History - Sai Â°û The Saka People or Soghdians.\\" ChinaKnowledge.de. Accessed 2 September 2016. Iaroslav Lebedynsky and Victor H. Mair speculate that some Sakas may also have migrated to the area of Yunnan in southern China following their expulsion by the Yuezhi. Excavations of the prehistoric art of the Dian Kingdom of Yunnan have revealed hunting scenes of Caucasoid horsemen in Central Asian clothing. The scenes depicted on these drums sometimes represent these horsemen practising hunting. Animal scenes of felines attacking oxen are also at times reminiscent of Scythian art both in theme and in composition. Migrations of the 2nd and 1st century BC have left traces in Sogdia and Bactria, but they cannot firmly be attributed to the Saka, similarly with the sites of Sirkap and Taxila in ancient India. The rich graves at Tillya Tepe in Afghanistan are seen as part of a population affected by the Saka. The Shakya clan of India, to which Gautama Buddha, called ≈öƒÅkyamuni \\"Sage of the Shakyas\\", belonged, were also likely Sakas, as Michael Witzel and Christopher I. Beckwith have demonstrated. =Indo-Scythians= The region in modern Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Saka moved to became known as \\"land of the Saka\\" or Sakastan. This is attested in a contemporary Kharosthi inscription found on the Mathura lion capital belonging to the Saka kingdom of the Indo-Scythians (200 BC ‚Äì 400 AD) in northern India,Bailey, H.W. (1996) \\"Khotanese Saka Literature\\", in Ehsan Yarshater (ed), The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol III: The Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian Periods, Part 2 (reprint edition), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp 1230‚Äì1231. roughly the same time the Chinese record that the Saka had invaded and settled the country of Jibin ÁΩΩË≥ì (i.e. Kashmir, of modern-day India and Pakistan). In the Persian language of contemporary Iran the territory of Drangiana was called SakastƒÅna, in Armenian as Sakastan, with similar equivalents in Pahlavi, Greek, Sogdian, Syriac, Arabic, and the Middle Persian tongue used in Turfan, Xinjiang, China. The Sakas also captured Gandhara and Taxila, and migrated to North India. The most famous Indo-Scythian king was Maues. An Indo-Scythians kingdom was established in Mathura (200 BC - 400 AD). Weer Rajendra Rishi, an Indian linguist, identified linguistic affinities between Indian and Central Asian languages, which further lends credence to the possibility of historical Sakan influence in North India. According to historian Michael Mitchiner, the Abhira tribe were a Saka people cited in the Gunda inscription of the Western Satrap Rudrasimha I dated to AD 181. =Kingdoms in the Tarim Basin= Kingdom of Khotan Coin of Gurgamoya, king of Khotan. Khotan, first century. Obv: Kharosthi legend, \\"Of the great king of kings, king of Khotan, Gurgamoya. Rev: Chinese legend: \\"Twenty-four grain copper coin\\". British Museum The Kingdom of Khotan was a Saka city state in on the southern edge of the Tarim Basin. As a consequence of the Han‚ÄìXiongnu War spanning from 133 BCE to 89 CE, the Tarim Basin (now Xinjiang, Northwest China), including Khotan and Kashgar, fell under Han Chinese influence, beginning with the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BC).Loewe, Michael. (1986). \\"The Former Han Dynasty,\\" in The Cambridge History of China: Volume I: the Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 B.C. ‚Äì A.D. 220, 103‚Äì222. Edited by Denis Twitchett and Michael Loewe.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp 410-411. . Archaeological evidence and documents from Khotan and other sites in the Tarim Basin provided information on the language spoken by the Saka. The official language of Khotan was initially Gandhari Prakrit written in Kharosthi, and coins from Khotan dated to the 1st century bear dual inscriptions in Chinese and Gandhari Prakrit, indicating links of Khotan to both India and China. Surviving documents however suggest that an Iranian language was used by the people of the kingdom for a long time Third-century AD documents in Prakrit from nearby Shanshan record the title for the king of Khotan as hinajha (i.e. \\"generalissimo\\"), a distinctively Iranian-based word equivalent to the Sanskrit title senapati, yet nearly identical to the Khotanese Saka hƒ´nƒÅysa attested in later Khotanese documents. This, along with the fact that the king's recorded regnal periods were given as the Khotanese k·π£u·πáa, \\"implies an established connection between the Iranian inhabitants and the royal power,\\" according to the Professor of Iranian Studies Ronald E. Emmerick. He contended that Khotanese-Saka-language royal rescripts of Khotan dated to the 10th century \\"makes it likely that the ruler of Khotan was a speaker of Iranian.\\" Furthermore, he argued that the early form of the name of Khotan, hvatana, is connected semantically with the name Saka. The region once again came under Chinese suzerainty with the campaigns of conquest by Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626-649).Xue, Zongzheng (ËñõÂÆóÊ≠£). (1992). History of the Turks (Á™ÅÂé•Âè≤).

However, by the early 11th century the region fell to the Muslim Turkic peoples of the Kara- Khanid Khanate, which led to both the Turkification of the region as well as its conversion from Buddhism to Islam.

Similar documents in the Khotanese-Saka language dating mostly to the 10th century have been found in the Dunhuang manuscripts. Although the ancient Chinese had called Khotan Yutian (‰∫éÈóê), another more native Iranian name occasionally used was Jusadanna (ÁûøËñ©Êó¶ÈÇ£), derived from Indo-Iranian Gostan and Gostana, the names of the town and region around it, respectively.Ulrich Theobald.

According to the Book of Han, the Saka split and formed several states in the region. These Saka states may include two states to the northwest of Kashgar, and Tumshuq to its northeast, and Tushkurgan south in the Pamirs. Kashgar also conquered other states such as Yarkand and Kucha during the Han dynasty, but in its later history, Kashgar was controlled by various empires, including Tang China, \\"The territory of YƒÅrkand is for the first time mentioned in the Hanshu (1st century BCE), under the name Shache (Old Chinese, approximately, *s¬≥a(j)-ka), which is probably related to the name of the Iranian Saka tribes.\\"Whitfield 2004, p. 47.Wechsler, Howard J.; Twitchett, Dennis C.

In the 11th century, according to Mahmud al-Kashgari, some non-Turkic languages like the Kanchaki and Sogdian were still used in some areas in the vicinity of Kashgar, and Kanchaki is thought to belong to the Saka language group. It is believed that the Tarim Basin was linguistically Turkified before the 11th century ended. Historiography Persians referred to all northern nomads as Sakas. Herodotus (IV.64) describes them as Scythians, although they figure under a different name: =Strabo= Scythia and the Parthian Empire in about 170 BC (before the Yuezhi invaded Bactria). In the 1st century BC, the Greek-Roman geographer Strabo gave an extensive description of the peoples of the eastern steppe, whom he located in Central Asia beyond Bactria and Sogdiana. Strabo went on to list the names of the various tribes he believed to be \\"Scythian\\", and in so doing almost certainly conflated them with unrelated tribes of eastern Central Asia. These tribes included the Saka. ::(Strabo, Geography, 11.8.1; transl. 1903 by H. C. Hamilton & W. Falconer.) =Indian sources= Indo-Scythian King Azes II (ruled c. 35‚Äì12 BC). Note the royal tamga on the coin. The Sakas receive numerous mentions in Indian texts, including the PurƒÅ·πáas, the Manusm·πõiti, the RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa, the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, and the MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya of Patanjali. Language Modern scholarly consensus is that the Eastern Iranian language ancestral to the Pamir languages in Central Asia and the medieval Saka language of Xinjiang, was one of the Scythian languages.Kuz'mina, Elena E. (2007). The Origin of the Indo Iranians. Edited by J.P. Mallory. Leiden, Boston: Brill, pp 381-382. . Evidence of the Middle Iranian \\"Scytho-Khotanese\\" language survives in Northwest China, where Khotanese-Saka-language documents, ranging from medical texts to Buddhist texts, have been found primarily in Khotan and Tumshuq (northeast of Kashgar). They largely predate the Islamization of Xinjiang under the Turkic-speaking Kara-Khanid Khanate. Similar documents, the Dunhuang manuscripts, were discovered written in the Khotanese Saka language and date mostly from the tenth century. Attestations of the Saka language show that it was an Eastern Iranian language. The linguistic heartland of Saka was the Kingdom of Khotan, which had two varieties, corresponding to the major settlements at Khotan (now called Hotan) and Tumshuq (now titled Tumxuk).Sarah Iles Johnston, Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide, Harvard University Press, 2004. pg 197Edward A Allworth,Central Asia: A Historical Overview,Duke University Press, 1994. pp 86. Tumshuqese and Khotanese varieties of Saka contain many borrowings from the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, but also share features with the modern Eastern Iranian languages Wakhi and Pashto. The Issyk inscription, a short fragment on a silver cup found in the Issyk kurgan in Kazakhstan is believed to be an early example of Saka, constituting one of very few autochthonous epigraphic traces of that language. The inscription is in a variant of Kharosthi. Harmatta identifies the dialect as Khotanese Saka, tentatively translating its as: \\"The vessel should hold wine of grapes, added cooked food, so much, to the mortal, then added cooked fresh butter on\\". A growing body of both linguistic and physical anthropological evidence suggest the Wakhi are descendants of Saka. According to the Indo-Europeanist Martin K√ºmmel, Wakhi may be classified as a Western Saka dialect; the other attested Saka dialects, Khotanese and Tumshuqese, would then be classified as Eastern Saka. The Saka heartland was gradually conquered during the Turkic expansion, beginning in the sixth century, and the area was gradually Turkified linguistically under the Uyghurs. Genetics Head of a Saka warrior, as a defeated enemy of the Yuezhi, from Khalchayan, 1st century BC.Also a Saka according to this source The earliest studies could only analyze segments of mtDNA, thus providing only broad correlations of affinity to modern West Eurasian or East Eurasian populations. For example, in a 2002 study the mitochondrial DNA of Saka period male and female skeletal remains from a double inhumation kurgan at the Beral site in Kazakhstan was analysed. The two individuals were found to be not closely related. The HV1 mitochondrial sequence of the male was similar to the Anderson sequence which is most frequent in European populations. The HV1 sequence of the female suggested a greater likelihood of Asian origins. More recent studies have been able to type for specific mtDNA lineages. For example, a 2004 study examined the HV1 sequence obtained from a male \\"Scytho-Siberian\\" at the Kizil site in the Altai Republic. It belonged to the N1a maternal lineage, a geographically West Eurasian lineage. Another study by the same team, again of mtDNA from two Scytho-Siberian skeletons found in the Altai Republic, showed that they had been typical males \\"of mixed Euro-Mongoloid origin\\". One of the individuals was found to carry the F2a maternal lineage, and the other the D lineage, both of which are characteristic of East Eurasian populations. These early studies have been elaborated by an increasing number of studies by Russian scholars. Conclusions are (i) an early, Bronze Age mixing of both west and east Eurasian lineages, with western lineages being found far to the east, but not vice versa; (ii) an apparent reversal by Iron Age times, with an increasing presence of East Eurasian lineages in the western steppe; (iii) the possible role of migrations from the south, the Balkano-Danubian and Iranian regions, toward the steppe. Ancient Y-DNA data was finally provided by Keyser et al in 2009. They studied the haplotypes and haplogroups of 26 ancient human specimens from the Krasnoyarsk area in Siberia dated from between the middle of the 2nd millennium BC and the 4th century AD (Scythian and Sarmatian timeframe). Nearly all subjects belonged to haplogroup R-M17. The authors suggest that their data shows that between the Bronze and the Iron Ages the constellation of populations known variously as Scythians, Andronovians, etc. were blue- (or green-) eyed, fair-skinned and light-haired people who might have played a role in the early development of the Tarim Basin civilisation. Moreover, this study found that they were genetically more closely related to modern populations in eastern Europe than those of central and southern Asia. The ubiquity and dominance of the R1a Y-DNA lineage contrasted markedly with the diversity seen in the mtDNA profiles. A genetic study published in Nature in May 2018 examined the remains of twenty-eight Sakas buried between ca. 900 BC to AD 1, compromising eight Sakas of southern Siberia (Tagar culture), eight Sakas of the central steppe (Tasmola culture), and twelve Sakas of the Tian Shan. The six samples of Y-DNA extracted from the Tian Shan Saka belonged to the haplogroups R (four samples), R1 and R1a1. The samples of mtDNA extracted from the Tien Shan Saka belonged to C4, H4d, T2a1, U5a1d2b, H2a, U5a1a1, HV6 (two samples), D4j8 (two samples), W1c and G2a1. The study detected significant genetic differences between the Sakas and Scythians of the Pannonian Basin, and between Sakas of southern Siberia, the central steppe and the Tian Shan. Tian Shan Sakas were found to be of about 70% Western Steppe Herder (WSH) ancestry, 25% Siberian Hunter-Gatherer ancestry and 5% Iranian Neolithic ancestry. The Iranian Neolithic ancestry was primarily male- derived, probably from the Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex. Sakas of the Tasmola culture were found to be of about 56% WSH ancestry and 44% Siberian Hunter-Gather ancestry. The peoples of the Tagar culture had about 83,5% WSH ancestry, 9% Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) ancestry and 7,5% Siberian Hunter-Gatherer ancestry. The study suggested that the Saka were the source of west Eurasian ancestry among the Xiongnu, and that the Huns probably emerged through conquests of Sakas by the Xiongnu, which is characterized by increased levels of East Asian paternal ancestry in Central Asia. Physical appearance Early physical analyses have unanimously concluded that the Saka, even those far to the east (e.g. the Pazyryk region), possessed predominantly \\"Europid\\" features, although mixed 'Euro-mongoloid\\" phenotypes also occur, depending on site and period. The 2nd century BC Han Chinese envoy Zhang Qian described the Sai (Saka) as having yellow (probably meaning hazel or green), and blue eyes. In Natural History, the 1st century AD Roman author Pliny the Elder characterises the Seres, sometimes identified as Sala or Tocharians, as red-haired and blue-eyed.Pliny. Naturalis Historia. 6. 88 Archaeology Pazyryk horseman in a felt painting from a burial around 300 BC. The Pazyryks appear to be closely related to the Scythians. The spectacular grave-goods from Arzhan, and others in Tuva, have been dated from about 900 BC onward, and are associated with the Saka. Burials at Pazyryk in the Altay Mountains have included some spectacularly preserved Sakas of the \\"Pazyryk culture\\" ‚Äì including the Ice Maiden of the 5th century BC. =Pazyryk culture= Saka burials documented by modern archaeologists include the kurgans at Pazyryk in the Ulagan (Red) district of the Altai Republic, south of Novosibirsk in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia (near Mongolia). Archaeologists have extrapolated the Pazyryk culture from these finds: five large burial mounds and several smaller ones between 1925 and 1949, one opened in 1947 by Russian archaeologist Sergei Rudenko. The burial mounds concealed chambers of larch- logs covered over with large cairns of boulders and stones. The Pazyryk culture flourished between the 7th and 3rd century BC in the area associated with the Sacae. Ordinary Pazyryk graves contain only common utensils, but in one, among other treasures, archaeologists found the famous Pazyryk Carpet, the oldest surviving wool-pile oriental rug. Another striking find, a 3-metre- high four-wheel funerary chariot, survived well-preserved from the 5th to 4th century BC. =Tillia Tepe treasure= A site found in 1968 in Tillia Tepe (literally \\"the golden hill\\") in northern Afghanistan (former Bactria) near Shebergan consisted of the graves of five women and one man with extremely rich jewelry, dated to around the 1st century BC, and probably related to that of Saka tribes normally living slightly to the north. Altogether the graves yielded several thousands of pieces of fine jewelry, usually made from combinations of gold, turquoise and lapis-lazuli. A high degree of cultural syncretism pervades the findings, however. Hellenistic cultural and artistic influences appear in many of the forms and human depictions (from amorini to rings with the depiction of Athena and her name inscribed in Greek), attributable to the existence of the Seleucid empire and Greco-Bactrian kingdom in the same area until around 140 BC, and the continued existence of the Indo-Greek kingdom in the northwestern Indian sub-continent until the beginning of our era. This testifies to the richness of cultural influences in the area of Bactria at that time. Culture =Art= Battle scenes on the Orlat plaques. 1st century CE. The art of the Saka was of a similar styles as other Iranian peoples of the steppes, which is referred to collectively as Scythian art. In 2001, the discovery of an undisturbed royal Scythian burial- barrow illustrated Scythian animal-style gold that lacks the direct influence of Greek styles. Forty-four pounds of gold weighed down the royal couple in this burial, discovered near Kyzyl, capital of the Siberian republic of Tuva. Ancient influences from Central Asia became identifiable in China following contacts of metropolitan China with nomadic western and northwestern border territories from the 8th century BC. The Chinese adopted the Scythian-style animal art of the steppes (descriptions of animals locked in combat), particularly the rectangular belt-plaques made of gold or bronze, and created their own versions in jade and steatite.Mallory and Mair, The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West, 2000) Following their expulsion by the Yuezhi, some Saka may also have migrated to the area of Yunnan in southern China. Saka warriors could also have served as mercenaries for the various kingdoms of ancient China. Excavations of the prehistoric art of the Dian civilisation of Yunnan have revealed hunting scenes of Caucasoid horsemen in Central Asian clothing.\\"Les Saces\\", Iaroslav Lebedynsky, p.73 Saka influences have been identified as far as Korea and Japan. Various Korean artifacts, such as the royal crowns of the kingdom of Silla, are said to be of \\"Scythian\\" design.Crowns similar to the Scythian ones discovered in Tillia Tepe \\"appear later, during the 5th and 6th century at the eastern edge of the Asia continent, in the tumulus tombs of the Kingdom of Silla, in South-East Korea. \\"Afganistan, les tr√©sors retrouv√©s\\", 2006, p282, Similar crowns, brought through contacts with the continent, can also be found in Kofun era Japan. =Society= Fraternal polyandry was a common custom among Saka. Brothers had one wife in common and the children were considered as belonging to the oldest brother. =Clothing= Royal crown, Tillia Tepe \\"Kings with dragons\\", Tillia Tepe Similar to other eastern Iranian peoples represented on the reliefs of the ApadƒÅna at Persepolis, Sakas are depicted as wearing long trousers, which cover the uppers of their boots. Over their shoulders they trail a type of long mantle, with one diagonal edge in back. One particular tribe of Sakas (the Saka tigraxaudƒÅ) wore pointed caps. Herodotus in his description of the Persian army mentions the Sakas as wearing trousers and tall pointed caps. Herodotus says Sakas had \\"high caps tapering to a point and stiffly upright.\\" Asian Saka headgear is clearly visible on the Persepolis Apadana staircase bas-relief ‚Äì high pointed hat with flaps over ears and the nape of the neck.The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago Photographic Archives. Persepolis ‚Äì Apadana, E Stairway, Tribute Procession, the Saka Tigraxauda Delegation. Retrieved 2012-6-27 From China to the Danube delta, men seemed to have worn a variety of soft headgear ‚Äì either conical like the one described by Herodotus, or rounder, more like a Phrygian cap. Saka women dressed in much the same fashion as men. A Pazyryk burial, discovered in the 1990s, contained the skeletons of a man and a woman, each with weapons, arrowheads, and an axe. Herodotus mentioned that Sakas had \\"high caps and ‚Ä¶ wore trousers.\\" Clothing was sewn from plain-weave wool, hemp cloth, silk fabrics, felt, leather and hides. Pazyryk findings give the most number of almost fully preserved garments and clothing worn by the Scythian/Saka peoples. Ancient Persian bas-reliefs, inscriptions from Apadana and Behistun and archaeological findings give visual representations of these garments. Based on the Pazyryk findings (can be seen also in the south Siberian, Uralic and Kazakhstan rock drawings) some caps were topped with zoomorphic wooden sculptures firmly attached to a cap and forming an integral part of the headgear, similar to the surviving nomad helmets from northern China. Men and warrior women wore tunics, often embroidered, adorned with felt applique work, or metal (golden) plaques. Persepolis Apadana again serves a good starting point to observe the tunics of the Sakas. They appear to be a sewn, long-sleeved garment that extended to the knees and was belted with a belt, while the owner's weapons were fastened to the belt (sword or dagger, gorytos, battle-axe, whetstone etc.). Based on numerous archeological findings, men and warrior women wore long-sleeved tunics that were always belted, often with richly ornamented belts. The Kazakhstan Saka (e.g. Issyk Golden Man/Maiden) wore shorter and closer-fitting tunics than the Pontic steppe Scythians. Some Pazyryk culture Saka wore short belted tunic with a lapel on the right side, with upright collar, 'puffed' sleeves narrowing at the wrist and bound in narrow cuffs of a color different from the rest of the tunic. Men and women wore coats: e.g. Pazyryk Saka had many varieties, from fur to felt. They could have worn a riding coat that later was known as a Median robe or Kantus. Long sleeved, and open, it seems that on the Persepolis Apadana Skudrian delegation is perhaps shown wearing such coat. The Pazyryk felt tapestry shows a rider wearing a billowing cloak.

In computer architecture, cache coherence is the uniformity of shared resource data that ends up stored in multiple local caches. When clients in a system maintain caches of a common memory resource, problems may arise with incoherent data, which is particularly the case with CPUs in a multiprocessing system. In the illustration on the right, consider both the clients have a cached copy of a particular memory block from a previous read. Suppose the client on the bottom updates/changes that memory block, the client on the top could be left with an invalid cache of memory without any notification of the change. Cache coherence is intended to manage such conflicts by maintaining a coherent view of the data values in multiple caches. Coherent caches: The value in all the caches' copies is the same. Overview In a shared memory multiprocessor system with a separate cache memory for each processor, it is possible to have many copies of shared data: one copy in the main memory and one in the local cache of each processor that requested it. When one of the copies of data is changed, the other copies must reflect that change. Cache coherence is the discipline which ensures that the changes in the values of shared operands (data) are propagated throughout the system in a timely fashion. The following are the requirements for cache coherence: ;Write Propagation: Changes to the data in any cache must be propagated to other copies (of that cache line) in the peer caches. ;Transaction Serialization: Reads/Writes to a single memory location must be seen by all processors in the same order. Theoretically, coherence can be performed at the load/store granularity. However, in practice it is generally performed at the granularity of cache blocks. Definition Coherence defines the behavior of reads and writes to a single address location. One type of data occurring simultaneously in different cache memory is called cache coherence, or in some systems, global memory. In a multiprocessor system, consider that more than one processor has cached a copy of the memory location X. The following conditions are necessary to achieve cache coherence: # In a read made by a processor P to a location X that follows a write by the same processor P to X, with no writes to X by another processor occurring between the write and the read instructions made by P, X must always return the value written by P. # In a read made by a processor P1 to location X that follows a write by another processor P2 to X, with no other writes to X made by any processor occurring between the two accesses and with the read and write being sufficiently separated, X must always return the value written by P2. This condition defines the concept of coherent view of memory. Propagating the writes to the shared memory location ensures that all the caches have a coherent view of the memory. If processor P1 reads the old value of X, even after the write by P2, we can say that the memory is incoherent. The above conditions satisfy the Write Propagation criteria required for cache coherence. However, they are not sufficient as they do not satisfy the Transaction Serialization condition. To illustrate this better, consider the following example: A multi-processor system consists of four processors - P1, P2, P3 and P4, all containing cached copies of a shared variable S whose initial value is 0. Processor P1 changes the value of S (in its cached copy) to 10 following which processor P2 changes the value of S in its own cached copy to 20. If we ensure only write propagation, then P3 and P4 will certainly see the changes made to S by P1 and P2. However, P3 may see the change made by P1 after seeing the change made by P2 and hence return 10 on a read to S. P4 on the other hand may see changes made by P1 and P2 in the order in which they are made and hence return 20 on a read to S. The processors P3 and P4 now have an incoherent view of the memory. Therefore, in order to satisfy Transaction Serialization, and hence achieve Cache Coherence, the following condition along with the previous two mentioned in this section must be met: * Writes to the same location must be sequenced. In other words, if location X received two different values A and B, in this order, from any two processors, the processors can never read location X as B and then read it as A. The location X must be seen with values A and B in that order.Neupane, Mahesh (April 16, 2004). \\"Cache Coherence\\" (PDF). Archived from the original (PDF) on 20 June 2010. The alternative definition of a coherent system is via the definition of sequential consistency memory model: \\"the cache coherent system must appear to execute all threads‚Äô loads and stores to a single memory location in a total order that respects the program order of each thread\\". Thus, the only difference between the cache coherent system and sequentially consistent system is in the number of address locations the definition talks about (single memory location for a cache coherent system, and all memory locations for a sequentially consistent system). Another definition is: \\"a multiprocessor is cache consistent if all writes to the same memory location are performed in some sequential order\\". Rarely, but especially in algorithms, coherence can instead refer to the locality of reference. Multiple copies of same data can exist in different cache simultaneously and if processors are allowed to update their own copies freely, an inconsistent view of memory can result.  Coherence mechanisms  The two most common mechanisms of ensuring coherency are snooping and directory-based, each having their own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping based protocols tend to be faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping isn't scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system, meaning that as the system gets larger, the size of the (logical or physical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (>64 processors) use this type of cache coherence. = Snooping = : First introduced in 1983, snooping is a process where the individual caches monitor address lines for accesses to memory locations that they have cached. The write-invalidate protocols and write-update protocols make use of this mechanism. : For the snooping mechanism, a snoop filter reduces the snooping traffic by maintaining a plurality of entries, each representing a cache line that may be owned by one or more nodes. When replacement of one of the entries is required, the snoop filter selects for the replacement the entry representing the cache line or lines owned by the fewest nodes, as determined from a presence vector in each of the entries. A temporal or other type of algorithm is used to refine the selection if more than one cache line is owned by the fewest nodes.Rasmus Ulfsnes (June 2013). \\"Design of a Snoop Filter for Snoop-Based Cache Coherency Protocols\\" (PDF). diva-portal.org. Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Retrieved 2014-01-20. = Directory- based = : In a directory-based system, the data being shared is placed in a common directory that maintains the coherence between caches. The directory acts as a filter through which the processor must ask permission to load an entry from the primary memory to its cache. When an entry is changed, the directory either updates or invalidates the other caches with that entry. Distributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms in an attempt to maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems.https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/252F96/Lecture18.pdf Coherence protocols Coherence protocols apply cache coherence in multiprocessor systems. The intention is that two clients must never see different values for the same shared data. The protocol must implement the basic requirements for coherence. It can be tailor-made for the target system or application. Protocols can also be classified as snoopy or directory-based. Typically, early systems used directory-based protocols where a directory would keep a track of the data being shared and the sharers. In snoopy protocols, the transaction requests (to read, write, or upgrade) are sent out to all processors. All processors snoop the request and respond appropriately. Write propagation in snoopy protocols can be implemented by either of the following methods: ;Write-invalidate: When a write operation is observed to a location that a cache has a copy of, the cache controller invalidates its own copy of the snooped memory location, which forces a read from main memory of the new value on its next access. ;Write-update: When a write operation is observed to a location that a cache has a copy of, the cache controller updates its own copy of the snooped memory location with the new data. If the protocol design states that whenever any copy of the shared data is changed, all the other copies must be \\"updated\\" to reflect the change, then it is a write-update protocol. If the design states that a write to a cached copy by any processor requires other processors to discard or invalidate their cached copies, then it is a write-invalidate protocol. However, scalability is one shortcoming of broadcast protocols. Various models and protocols have been devised for maintaining coherence, such as MSI, MESI (aka Illinois), MOSI, MOESI, MERSI, MESIF, write-once, Synapse, Berkeley, Firefly and Dragon protocol. In 2011, ARM Ltd proposed the AMBA 4 ACE for handling coherency in SoCs.

Designed as the so-called \\"Ultimate Interceptor\\", it proved to be the last dedicated interceptor in U.S. Air Force service to date. It was gradually retired during the 1980s, with the QF-106 drone conversions of the aircraft being used until 1998 under the Pacer Six program.Winchester 2006, p. 55. Development =Antecedents= The F-106 was the ultimate development of the USAF's 1954 interceptor program of the early 1950s. The initial winner of this competition had been the F-102 Delta Dagger, but early versions of this aircraft had demonstrated extremely poor performance, limited to subsonic speeds and relatively low altitudes. During the testing program the F-102 underwent numerous changes to improve its performance, notably the application of the area rule to the fuselage shaping and a change of engine, and the dropping of the advanced MX-1179 fire control system and its replacement with a slightly upgraded version of the MX-1 already in use on subsonic designs. The resulting aircraft became the F-102A, and in spite of being considered barely suitable for its mission, the Air Force sent out a production contract in March 1954, with the first deliveries expected in the following year. By December 1951 the Air Force had already turned its attention to a further improved version, the F-102B. Initially the main planned change was the replacement of the A-model's Pratt & Whitney J57 (itself replacing the original J40) with the more powerful Bristol Olympus, produced under license as the Wright J67. By the time this would be available, the MX-1179 was expected to be available, and was selected as well. The result would be the \\"ultimate interceptor\\" the Air Force wanted originally. However, while initial work on the Olympus appeared to go well, by August 1953 Wright was already a full year behind schedule in development. Continued development did not resolve problems with the engine, and in early 1955 the Air Force approved the switch to the Pratt & Whitney J75.The reason for Wright's problems adapting the Olympus are not well recorded. Bristol appears to have had a smooth time introducing the Olympus in British service, and the design would go on to serve for decades. The J75 was somewhat larger than the J57 in the F-102A, and had greater mass flow. This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and this led to the further refinement of using a variable-geometry inlet duct to allow the intakes to be tuned to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. This change also led to the ducts being somewhat shorter. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was cleaned up and simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine's 2-position afterburner exhaust nozzle was also used for idle thrust control. The nozzle was held open reducing idle thrust by 40% giving slower taxiing and less brake wear.Flight Manual F-106A and F-106B T.O. 1F106A-1 page 1-22 \\"Idle thrust control switch\\" =Production contract= A mock-up with the expected layout of the MX-1179, now known as the MA-1, was inspected and approved in December 1955. With growing confidence that the aircraft was now improving, an extended production contract for 17 F-102Bs was sent out on 18 April 1956. On 17 June, the aircraft was officially re-designated as the F-106A. =Prototype= The first prototype F-106, an aerodynamic test bed, flew on 26 December 1956 from Edwards Air Force Base, with the second, fitted with a fuller set of equipment, following 26 February 1957.Peacock 1986, p. 200. Initial flight tests at the end of 1956 and beginning of 1957 were disappointing, with performance less than anticipated, while the engine and avionics proved unreliable. These problems, and the delays associated with them, nearly led to the abandoning of the program,Wegg 1990, p. 209. but the Air Force decided to order 350 F-106s instead of the planned 1,000. After some minor redesign, the new aircraft, designated F-106A, were delivered to 15 fighter interceptor squadrons along with the F-106B two-seat combat-capable trainer variant, starting in October 1959.Green 1964, p. 138. =World Speed record= F-106A Delta Darts from 5 FIS at CFB Moose Jaw in 1982 On 15 December 1959, Major Joseph W. Rogers set a world speed record of 1,525.96 mph (2,455.79 km/h) in a Delta Dart at 40,500 ft (12,300 m).Drendel 1980, p. 92.\\"U.S. Jet Sets 1,520.9-M.P.H. Speed Record\\", Oakland Tribune, 16 December 1959, p. 1. That year, Charles E. Myers flew the same model aircraft at 1,544 mph (2484 km/h). Design The F-106 was envisaged as a specialized all-weather missile-armed interceptor to shoot down bombers. It was complemented by other Century Series fighters for other roles such as daylight air superiority or fighter-bombing. To support its role, the F-106 was equipped with the Hughes MA-1 integrated fire-control system, which could be linked to the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) network for ground control interception (GCI) missions, allowing the aircraft to be steered by controllers. The MA-1 proved extremely troublesome and was eventually upgraded more than 60 times in service.Baugher, Joe. \\"Convair F-106A Delta Dart.\\" USAAC/USAAF/USAF Fighter and Pursuit Aircraft: Convair F-106 Delta Dart, American Military Aircraft, 19 December 1999. Retrieved: 8 April 2011. Similar to the F-102, the F-106 was designed without a gun, or provision for carrying bombs, but it carried its missiles in an internal weapons bay for clean supersonic flight. It was armed with four Hughes AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles, along with a single GAR-11/AIM-26A Falcon nuclear-tipped semi-active radar homing (SARH) missile (which detected reflected radar signals), or a 1.5 kiloton-warhead AIR-2 (MB-2) Genie air-to- air rocket intended to be fired into enemy bomber formations.Winchester 2006, p. 54. Like its predecessor, the F-102 Delta Dagger, it could carry a drop tank under each wing.Taylor 1995, p. 93. Later fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle carried missiles recessed in the fuselage or externally, but stealth aircraft would re-adopt the idea of carrying missiles or bombs internally for reduced radar signature. = Ejection seats = The first ejection seat fitted to early F-106s was a variation of the seat used by the F-102 and was called the Weber interim seat. It was a catapult seat which used an explosive charge to propel it clear of the aircraft. This seat was not a zero-zero seat and was inadequate for ejections at supersonic speeds as well as ground level ejections and ejections at speeds below and . The second seat that replaced the Weber interim seat was the Convair/ICESC (Industry Crew Escape System Committee) Supersonic Rotational B-seat, called the supersonic \\"bobsled\\", hence the B designation. It was designed with supersonic ejection as the primary criterion since the F-106 was capable of Mach-2 performance. Fighter pilots viewed high speed ejections as the most important. Seat designers viewed an ejection at low altitude and slow speed as the most likely possibility. The ejection sequence with the B-seat was quite complicated and there were some unsuccessful ejections that resulted in pilot fatalities. The third seat, that replaced the Convair B-seat, was the Weber Zero-Zero ROCAT (for Rocket Catapult) seat. Weber Aircraft Corporation designed a \\"zero-zero\\" seat to operate at up to . High-altitude supersonic ejections were rare and ejections at relatively low altitudes and low speeds were more likely. The Weber \\"zero-zero\\" seat was satisfactory and was retrofitted to the F-106 after 1965. Operational history Tu-95 is intercepted by a F-106A off Cape Cod in 1982 The F-106 served in the contiguous US, Alaska, and Iceland, as well as for brief periods in Germany and South Korea. The F-106 was the second highest sequentially numbered P/F- aircraft to enter service under the old number sequence (the F-111 was highest), before the system was reset under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system. In service, the F-106's official name, \\"Delta Dart,\\" was rarely used, and the aircraft was universally known simply as \\"The Six.\\" Although contemplated for use in the Vietnam War the F-106 never saw combat, nor was it exported to foreign users. Following the resolution of initial teething problems ‚Äì in particular an ejection seat that killed the first 12 pilots to eject from the aircraft Broughton 2007, p. 17. ‚Äì its exceptional performance made it very popular with its pilots. After the cancellation of their own Avro Arrow, the Canadian government briefly considered purchasing the F-106C/D. In an effort to standardize aircraft types, the USAF was directed to conduct Operation Highspeed, a flyoff competition between the USAF F-106A and the U.S. Navy F4H-1 (F-4B) Phantom, which was not only as capable as the F-106 as a missile-armed interceptor, but could also carry as large a bomb load as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bomber.\\"F-106 Delta Dart.\\" National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The Phantom was the winner, but would first be tasked to escort and later replace the F-105 fighter-bomber in the late 1960s before replacing older interceptors in Air Defense Command in the 1970s. An F-106A of the 87th FIS above Charleston AFB, SC in 1982. The F-106 was progressively updated in service, with improved avionics, a modified wing featuring a noticeable conical camber, an infrared search and track system, streamlined supersonic wing tanks which provided virtually no degradation to overall aircraft performance, better instrumentation, and features like an inflight refuelling receptacle and an arrestor hook for landing emergencies. Air-to-air combat testing suggested \\"The Six\\" was a reasonable match for the F-4 Phantom II in a dogfight, with superior high-altitude turn performance and overall maneuverability (aided by the aircraft's lower wing loading). However, the Phantom had better radar ‚Äì operated by an additional crewman ‚Äì and could carry a load of up to four radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow and four infrared AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, while the AIM-4 Falcon missiles carried by the F-106 proved a disappointment for dogfighting over Vietnam. The F-4 had a higher thrust/weight ratio with superior climb, better high speed/low-altitude maneuverability, and could be used as a fighter-bomber. Air combat experience over Vietnam showed the need for increased pilot visibility and the utility of a built-in gun, which had been added to the \\"E\\" variant of USAF Phantoms. A NASA QF-106 Delta Dart from the Eclipse program shows its area ruled fuselage In 1972, some F-106As were upgraded in Project Six Shooter that involved fitting the F-106 with a new canopy without metal bracing which greatly improved pilot visibility. Also added was an optical gunsight, and provision for a single M61 Vulcan 20 mm cannon. The M61 Vulcan had 650 rounds of ammunition in the center weapons bay and it replaced the AIM-26 Super Falcon or Genie. The F-15A Eagle started replacing the F-106 in 1981, with \\"The Sixes\\" typically passed on to Air National Guard units. The F-106 remained in service in various USAF and ANG units until 1988. =Retirement and conversion into drones= Between 1 June 1983 and 1 August 1988 the Delta Darts were incrementally retired and sent to the Military Storage and Disposition Center in Arizona. When the need for a high performance Full Scaled Aerial Target Drone was required the USAF began withdrawing Delta Darts from storage. Starting in 1986, 194 of the surviving surplus aircraft were converted into target drones and these were designated QF-106As and used for target practice vehicles under the Pacer Six Program by the Aerial Targets Squadron. The last was destroyed in January 1998. The drones were still capable of being flown as manned aircraft, such as for ferrying to a test; during the test they were flown unmanned. The QF-106 replaced the QF-100 Super Sabre drone; the last shoot down of a QF-106 (57-2524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997 after which the QF-106 was superseded by the QF-4S and QF-4E Phantom II drone. =NASA research and test aircraft= Six F-106s were retained by NASA for test purposes through 1998. An F-106B two-seat trainer was operated by NASA Langley Research Center between 1979 and 1991. This Delta Dart was used in research programs ranging from testing supersonic engines to improving maneuverability of fighters. Between 1980 and 1986 the aircraft was modified for the purpose of lightning strike research and became known as the Lightning Strike Plane and was struck 714 times without damage. On one hour-long flight at in 1984, lightning struck the research aircraft 72 times. One significant modification was the replacement of the composite nose radome by a metallic radome. Although the maximum speed of the F-106 was Mach 2.3, during the lightning experiments it was flown at subsonic speeds into clouds at from . The aircraft was equipped with optical sensors which consisted of a video camera and a light detector. Data acquisition was performed with 1980s state of the art digital waveform recorders. The Cornfield Bomber, pictured here shortly after earning its nickname. Eclipse project NASA used six drones in its Eclipse Project which ran from 1997‚Äì1998. The Dryden Flight Research Center supported project Eclipse which sought to demonstrate the feasibility of a reusable Aerotow-launch vehicle. The objective was to tow, inflight, a modified QF-106 aircraft with a C-141A transport aircraft. The test demonstrated the possibility of towing and launching a space launch vehicle from behind a tow plane. =The Cornfield Bomber= On 2 February 1970, an F-106 of the 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, piloted by Captain Gary Foust, entered a flat spin over Montana. Foust followed procedures and ejected from the aircraft. The resulting change of balance caused the aircraft to stabilize and later land \\"wheels up\\" in a snow-covered field, suffering only minor damage. The aircraft, promptly nicknamed \\"The Cornfield Bomber\\", was then sent back to base by rail, repaired and returned to service, and is now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.\\"58-0787 Pilot-less Landing: 'Cornfield Bomber'.\\" f-106deltadart.com.

Performance was deemed unsatisfactory and modifications were made. The aircraft was capable of low supersonic speeds without afterburner (but with a significant range penalty) and had a maximum altitude at least . Many were fitted with a conically-cambered wing for improved takeoff, supersonic and high-altitude flight. To improve the aircraft's range the aircraft was fitted with two streamlined external supersonic tanks that still kept the aircraft capable of sustained roll rates of 100 degrees per second. Since these tanks produced virtually no significant performance degradation they were rarely jettisoned and were routinely carried around. After 1972, many F-106s were refitted with a new canopy featuring improved visibility, improved optic sights and provision for a gunpack in the center weapons bay. *A two-seat F-106B trainer variant of the New Jersey ANGF-106B: (Convair Model 8-27) Two-seat, combat-capable training version.

A major appliance, or domestic appliance, is a large machine in home appliance used for routine housekeeping tasks such as cooking, washing laundry, or food preservation. An appliance is different from a plumbing fixture because it uses electricity or fuel. Major appliances differ from small appliances because they are bigger and not portable. They are often considered fixtures and part of real estate and as such they are often supplied to tenants as part of otherwise unfurnished rental properties. Major appliances may have special electrical connections, connections to gas supplies, or special plumbing and ventilation arrangements that may be permanently connected to the appliance. This limits where they can be placed in a home. Many major appliances are made of enamel-coated sheet steel which, in the middle 20th century, was usually white. The term white goods in contrast to brown goods, is also used, primarily where British English is spoken, although definitions for the term \\"white goods\\" can differ. Many appliances nowadays would be considered brown goods, some being connected to the Internet. In the United States, the term white goods can also refer to linens.\\" 'white goods' - Definition - Merriam-Webster\\" Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary In New Zealand \\"whiteware\\" may be used, elsewhere a term from pottery.\\"Energy Star Products\\" Energy Star.govt.nz Since major appliances in a home consume a significant amount of energy, they have become the objectives of programs to improve their energy efficiency in many countries. Energy efficiency improvements may require changes in construction of the appliances, or improved control systems. Brands A modern gas stove In the early days of electrification, many major consumer appliances were made by the same companies that made the generation and distribution equipment. While some of these brand names persist to the present day, even if only as licensed use of old popular brand names, today many major appliances are manufactured by companies or divisions of companies that specialize particular appliances.

An example would be the threat \\"Get out, or else‚Äî!\\" This device often portrays its users as overcome with passion (fear, anger, excitement) or modesty. To mark the occurrence of aposiopesis with punctuation, an em-rule (‚Äî) or an ellipsis (‚Ä¶) may be used. Examples * One classical example of aposiopesis in Virgil occurs in Aeneid 1.135. Neptune, the Roman god of the Sea, is angry with the winds, whom Juno released to start a storm and harass the Trojan hero and protagonist Aeneas. Neptune berates the winds for causing a storm without his approval, but breaks himself off mid-threat: > Iam caelum terramque me≈ç sine n≈´mine, ventƒ´, miscƒìre et tantƒÅs audƒìtis > tollere m≈çlƒìs? qu≈çs ego‚Äîsed m≈çt≈çs praestat comp≈çnere fl≈´ct≈´s. > Now, winds, you dare to embroil the sky and the earth without my approval, > and raise up such a mass? You whom, I‚Äî! But it is better to settle the > agitated waves. *Another example in Virgil occurs in the Aeneid 2.100. Sinon, the Greek who is posing as a defector to deceive the Trojans into accepting the Trojan Horse within their city wall, tells about how Ulixes > hinc mihi prima malis labes, hinc semper Vlixes criminibus terrere nouis, > hinc spargere uoces in uulgum ambiguas et quaerere conscius arma. nec > requieuit enim, donec Calchante ministro‚Äî > This was the time when the first onslaught of ruin began for me. Ulixes kept > terrifying me with new accusations, kept spreading ambiguous rumors among > the people, and kept looking for quarrel. Nor did he in fact ever stop, > until with the help of Calchas‚Äî * A biblical example is found in Psalm 27, verse 13. It says: \\"Unless I had believed I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living ‚Ä¶\\" The implication is that the author does not know what he would have done. * King Lear, overcome by anger at his daughters, says: > No, you unnatural hags, I will have such revenges on you both, That all the > world shall‚Äî I will do such things,‚Äî What they are, yet I know not: but they > shall be The terrors of the earth. (Shakespeare, King Lear, II.iv) * Aposiopesis also occurs at the agitated climax of Mercutio's \\"Queen Mab\\" speech, resulting in a calming intervention by Romeo: > Mercutio. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them > and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is > she‚Äî Romeo. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing. > (Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, I.iv) * Dante Alighieri used an Aposiopesis in his Divine Comedy, Hell IX, 7-9 (citation from the translation by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) (Virgil speaks to himself): > ‚ÄúStill it behoveth us to win the fight,‚Äù Began he; ‚Äúelse . . . Such offered > us herself . . . O how I long that some one here arrive!‚Äù Grammatical definition In syntax, an aposiopesis arises when the \\"if\\" clause (protasis) of a condition is stated without an ensuing \\"then\\" clause, or apodosis. Because an aposiopesis implies the trailing off of thought, it is never directly followed by a period, which would effectively result in four consecutive dots.

He was brought to power with the support of France and the United States, who provided training, arms and financing. In May 2016, he was found guilty by a court in Senegal of human- rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison. He is the first former head of state to be convicted for human rights abuses in the court of another nation. Early life Habr√© was born in 1942 in Faya-Largeau, northern Chad, then a colony of France, into a family of shepherds. He is a member of the Anakaza branch of the Daza Gourane ethnic group, which is itself a branch of the Toubou ethnic group.Sam C. Nolutshungu, Limits of Anarchy: Intervention and State Formation in Chad (1996), page 110. After primary schooling, he obtained a post in the French colonial administration, where he impressed his superiors and gained a scholarship to study in France at the Institute of Overseas Higher Studies in Paris. He completed a university degree in political science in Paris, and returned to Chad in 1971. He also obtained several other degrees and earned his Doctorate from the Institute. After a further brief period of government service as a deputy prefect, he visited Tripoli and joined the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) where he became a commander in the Second Liberation Army of FROLINAT along with Goukouni Oueddei. After Abba Siddick assumed the leadership of FROLINAT, the Second Liberation Army, first under Oueddei's command and then under Habr√©'s, split from FROLINAT and became the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (CCFAN). In 1976 Oueddei and Habr√© quarreled and Habr√© split his newly named Armed Forces of the North (Forces Arm√©es du Nord or FAN) from Goukouni's followers who adopted the name of People's Armed Forces (Forces Arm√©es Populaires or FAP). Both FAP and FAN operated in the extreme north of Chad, drawing their fighters from the Toubou nomadic people. Habr√© first came to international attention when a group under his command attacked the town of Barda√Ø in Tibesti, on 21 April 1974, and took three Europeans hostage, with the intention of ransoming them for money and arms. The captives were a German physician, Dr. Christoph Staewen (whose wife Elfriede was killed in the attack), and two French citizens, Fran√ßoise Claustre, an archeologist, and Marc Combe, a development worker. Staewen was released on 11 June 1974 after significant payments by West German officials. Combe escaped in 1975, but despite the intervention of the French Government, Claustre (whose husband was a senior French government official) was not released until 1 February 1977. Habr√© split with Oueddei, partly over this hostage-taking incident (which became known as the \\"Claustre affair\\" in France). Rise to power In August 1978 Habr√© was given the posts of Prime Minister of Chad and Vice President of Chad as part of an alliance with Gen. F√©lix Malloum. However, the power-sharing alliance did not last long. In February 1979 Habr√©'s forces and the national army under Malloum fought in N'Djamena. The fighting effectively left Chad without a national government. Several attempts were made by other nations to resolve the crisis, resulting in a new national government in November 1979 in which Habr√© was appointed Minister of Defense. However, fighting resumed within a matter of weeks. In December 1980 Habr√© was driven into exile in Sudan. In 1982 he resumed his fight against the Chadian government. FAN won control of N'Djamena in June and appointed Habr√© as head of state. Rule Habr√© seized power in Chad and ruled from 1982 until he was deposed in 1990 by Idriss D√©by. Habr√©'s one-party r√©gime, like many others before his, was characterized by widespread human rights abuses and atrocities. He denies killing and torturing tens of thousands of his opponents, although in 2012 the UN's International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Senegal to put him on trial or extradite him to face justice overseas. Following his rise to power Habr√© created a secret police force known as the Documentation and Security Directorate (DDS), under which his opponents were tortured and executed. Some methods of torture commonly used by the DDS included burning the body of the detainee with incandescent objects, spraying gas into their eyes, ears and nose, forced swallowing of water, and forcing the mouths of detainees around the exhaust pipes of running cars. Habr√©'s government also periodically engaged in ethnic cleansing against groups such as the Sara, Hadjerai and the Zaghawa, killing and arresting group members en masse when it was perceived that their leaders posed a threat to the regime. Habr√© fled, with $11 million of public money, to Senegal after being overthrown in 1990. He was placed under house arrest in 2005 until his arrest in 2013. He is accused of war crimes and torture during his eight years in power in Chad, where rights groups say that some 40,000 people were killed under his rule. Human Rights Watch claims that 1,200 were killed and 12,000 were tortured, and a domestic Chadian commission of inquiry claims that as many as 40,000 were killed and that more than 200,000 were subjected to torture. Human Rights Watch later dubbed Habr√© \\"Africa's Pinochet.\\"\\"Africa's Pinochet\\" or the beginning of \\"Africa's solutions\\"? Al Jazeera War with Libya Libya invaded Chad in July 1980, occupying and annexing the Aozou Strip. The United States and France responded by aiding Chad in an attempt to contain Libya's regional ambitions under Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi. In 1980, the unity government signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation with Libya. The treaty allowed the Chadian government to call on Libya for assistance if Chad's independence or internal security was threatened. The Libyan army was soon assisting the government forces, under Goukouni, and ousted FAN from much of northern Chad, including N'Djamena on December 15. Libyan troops withdrew in November 1981. Without their support, Goukouni's government troops were weakened and Habr√© capitalized on this and his FAN militia entered N'Djamena on 7 June 1982. In 1983, Libyan troops returned to Chad and remained in the country, supporting Goukouni's militia, until 1988. Despite this victory, Habr√©'s government was weak, and strongly opposed by members of the Zaghawa ethnic group. A rebel offensive in November 1990, which was led by Idriss D√©by, a Zaghawa former army commander who had participated in a plot against Habr√© in 1989 and subsequently fled to Sudan, defeated Habr√©'s forces. The French chose not to assist Habr√© on this occasion, allowing him to be ousted; it is possible that they actively aided D√©by. Explanation and speculation regarding the reasons for France's abandonment of Habr√© include the adoption of a policy of non-interference in intra-Chadian conflicts, dissatisfaction with Habr√©'s unwillingness to move towards multiparty democracy, and favoritism by Habr√© towards American rather than French companies with regard to oil development. Habr√© fled to Cameroon, and the rebels entered N'Djamena on 2 December 1990; Habr√© subsequently went into exile in Senegal.Bernard Lanne, \\"Chad: Regime Change, Increased Insecurity, and Blockage of Further Reforms\\", Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. Clark and Gardinier, page 274 (see also note 26). Support of the U.S. and France The United States and France supported Habr√©, seeing him as a bulwark against the Gaddafi government in neighboring Libya. Under President Ronald Reagan, the United States gave covert CIA paramilitary support to help Habr√© take power and remained one of Habr√©'s strongest allies throughout his rule, providing his regime with massive amounts of military aid.U.S.-Backed Chadian Dictator Hiss√®ne Habr√© Faces War Crimes Trial in Historic Win for His Victims. Democracy Now! 2 July 2013. The United States also used a clandestine base in Chad to train captured Libyan soldiers whom it was organizing into an anti-Qaddafi force. \\"The CIA was so deeply involved in bringing Habr√© to power I can't conceive they didn't know what was going on,\\" said Donald Norland, U.S. ambassador to Chad from 1979 to 1981. \\"But there was no debate on the policy and virtually no discussion of the wisdom of doing what we did.\\" Documents obtained by Human Rights Watch show that the United States provided Habr√©'s DDS with training, intelligence, arms, and other support despite knowledge of its atrocities. Records discovered in the DDS' meticulous archives describe training programs by American instructors for DDS agents and officials, including a course in the United States that was attended by some of the DDS' most feared torturers. According to the Chadian Truth Commission, the United States also provided the DDS with monthly infusions of monetary aid and financed a regional network of intelligence networks code-named \\"Mosaic\\" that Chad used to pursue suspected opponents of Habr√©'s regime even after they fled the country. In the summer of 1983, when Libya invaded northern Chad and threatened to topple Habr√©, France sent paratroops with air support, while the Reagan administration provided two AWACS electronic surveillance planes to coordinate air cover. By 1987 Gaddafi's forces had retreated. \\"Habr√© was a remarkably able man with a brilliant sense of how to play the outside world,\\" a former senior U.S. official said. \\"He was also a bloodthirsty tyrant and torturer. It is fair to say we knew who and what he was and chose to turn a blind eye.\\" Legal proceedings =Allegations of crimes against humanity= Human rights groups hold Habr√© responsible for the killing of thousands of people, but the exact number is unknown. Killings included massacres against ethnic groups in the south (1984), against the Hadjerai (1987), and against the Zaghawa (1989). Human Rights Watch charged him with having authorized tens of thousands of political murders and physical torture. Habr√© had been called \\"the African Pinochet,\\" in reference to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Habre would personally sign death warrants and oversee torture sessions, and was accused of personally participating in torture and rape. According to some leading experts, the tribunal that judges him, constitute an \\"internationalized tribunal\\", even if it is the most 'national' within this category\\". The government of Idriss Deby established a Commission of Inquiry into the Crimes and Misappropriations Committed by Ex-President Habr√©, His Accomplices and/or Accessories in 1990, which reported that 40,000 people had been killed, but did not follow up on its recommendations. =Initial trial attempts= Between 1993 and 2003, Belgium had universal jurisdiction legislation (the Belgian War Crimes Law) allowing the most serious violations of human rights to be tried in national as well as international courts, without any direct connection to the country of the alleged perpetrator, the victims or where the crimes took place. Despite the repeal of the legislation, investigations against Habr√© went ahead and in September 2005 he was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations. Senegal, where Habr√© had been in exile for 17 years, had Habr√© under nominal house arrest in Dakar. The Independent On 17 March 2006, the European Parliament demanded that Senegal turn over Habr√© to Belgium to be tried. Senegal did not comply, and it at first refused extradition demands from the African Union which arose after Belgium asked to try Habr√©. The Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights expressed its approval of the decision. If he were to be turned over, he would have become the first former dictator to be extradited by a third-party country to stand trial for human rights abuses. In 2007, Senegal set up its own special war-crimes court to try Habr√© under pressure from the African Union. On 8 April 2008, the National Assembly of Senegal voted to amend the constitution to clear the way for Habr√© to be prosecuted in Senegal; Ibrahima Gueye was appointed as trial coordinator in May 2008. A joint session of the National Assembly and the Senate voted in July 2008 to approve a bill empowering Senegalese courts to try people for crimes committed in other countries and for crimes that were committed more than ten years beforehand; this made it constitutionally possible to try Habr√©. Senegalese Minister of Justice Madicke Niang appointed four investigative judges on this occasion. A 2007 movie by director Klaartje Quirijns, The Dictator Hunter, tells the story of the activists Souleymane Guengueng and Reed Brody who led the efforts to bring Habr√© to trial.] =Trial in Chad= On 15 August 2008, a Chadian court sentenced Habr√© to death in absentia for war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with allegations that he had worked with rebels inside Chad to oust D√©by. Fran√ßois Serres, a lawyer for Habr√©, criticized this trial on 22 August for unfairness and secrecy. According to Serres, the accusation on which the trial was based was previously unknown and Habr√© had not received any notification of the trial. 14 victims filed new complaints with a Senegalese prosecutor on 16 September, accusing Habr√© of crimes against humanity and torture.\\"African Union: Press Senegal on Habr√© Trial\\", Human Rights Watch, 28 January 2009 =Trial in Senegal= The Senegalese government added an amendment in 2008, which would allow Habr√© to be tried in court. Senegal later changed their position, however, requesting 27 million euros in funding from the international community before going through with the trial. This prompted Belgium to pressure the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to force Senegal to either extradite Habr√© to Belgium or to proceed with the trial. The ICJ declined to force extradition, finding that prosecution is an international obligation the violation of which is a wrongful act engaging the responsibility of the State, while extradition is an option offered to the State. Senegal was found have failed international obligations by 1.)failing to make immediately a preliminary inquiry into the fact relating to the alleged crimes; and 2.) failing to submit the case to its competent authorities for prosecution (obligations according to UN Convention on Torture and Other Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984) that Senegal had bound itself to)] The ICJ rejected Senegal Defenses of insufficient funds and opposition by domestic law, instead unanimously ordering Senegal to submit the case to authorities for prosecution or extradite him without delay. In November 2010, the court of justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ruled that Senegal could not hold trial in the matter through local court only, and asked for the creation of a special tribunal on the matter of Habr√©'s prosecution. In April 2011, after initial reticence, Senegal agreed to the creation of an ad hoc tribunal in collaboration with the African Union, the Chadian state and with international funding. Senegal changed their position again however, walking out during discussions on establishing the court on 30 May 2011 without explanation. The African union commission on Habr√©, in preparation for their next summit on 30 June, published a report urging to press Senegal to extradite Habr√© to Belgium. On 8 July 2011, Senegal officials announced that Habr√© would be extradited to Chad on 11 July, but this was subsequently halted. In July 2012, the ICJ ruled that Senegal must start Habr√©'s trial \\"without delay\\". Amnesty International called on Senegal to abide by the ICJ's ruling, calling it \\"a victory for victims that's long overdue\\". A trial by the International Criminal Court (ICC) was ruled out, because the crimes took place before the ICC was fully established in 2002, and its jurisdiction is limited to events that took place after that date. In December 2012, the Parliament of Senegal passed a law allowing for the creation of an international tribunal in Senegal to try Habre. The judges of the tribunal would be appointed by the African Union, and come from elsewhere in Africa. On 30 June 2013, Habr√© was arrested in Senegal by the Senegalese police. Chadian President Idriss Deby said of his arrest that it was a step towards \\"an Africa free of all evil, an Africa stripped of all dictatorships.\\" Senegal's court, set up with the African Union, charged him with crimes against humanity and torture. That year he was also sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity by a Chadian court. The Tribunal that judged Hissi√®ne Habr√© in S√©n√©gal is said to have a huge range of specificities On 20 July 2015 the trial started. Waiting for the trial to open, Habr√© shouted: \\"Down with imperialists. [The trial] is a farce by rotten Senegalese politicians. African traitors. Valet of America\\". After that Habr√© was taken out of the courtroom and the trial began without him. On 21 July 2015 Habr√©'s trial was postponed to 7 September 2015, after his lawyers refused to participate in court. =Conviction by the Special Tribunal in Senegal= On 30 May 2016, the Extraordinary African Chambers found Habr√© guilty of rape, sexual slavery, and ordering the killing of 40,000 people during his tenure as Chadian president and sentenced him to life in prison in the Prison du Cap Manuel where he will purge his sentence.http://maderpost.com/prison-du-cap-manuel-la-sante-de- hissene-habre-inquiete/ The verdict marked the first time an African Union- backed court convicted a former ruler for human-rights abuses and the first time that the courts of one country have prosecuted the former ruler of another country for crimes against humanity. In May 2017, Judge Ougadeye Wafi upheld Habre's life sentence and all convictions against him, except rape. The court emphasized this was a procedural matter, as the facts the victim offered during her testimony came too late in the proceedings to be included within charges of mass sexual violence committed by his security agents, the convictions for which were upheld. On 7 April 2020, a judge in Senegal granted Habre two months' leave from prison, as the jail is being used to hold new detainees in coronavirus quarantine. After finishing his home freedom he will have returned to prison on June 7.https://www.jeuneafrique.com/996420/societe/senegal-le-tchadien-hissene- habre-regagne-sa-prison/https://www.notimerica.com/politica/noticia-chad- expresidente-chad-hissene-habre-vuelve-prision-senegal-permiso- covid-19-20200608115455.htmlhttps://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/06/former- chadian-strongman-hissene-habre-returns-to-prison/ See also * Rose Lokissim References External links * Belgium v.

Perry was a pioneer in the 1970s development of dub music with his early adoption of remixing and studio effects to create new instrumental or vocal versions of existing reggae tracks. He has worked with and produced for a wide variety of artists, including Bob Marley and the Wailers, Junior Murvin, the Congos, Max Romeo, Adrian Sherwood, the Beastie Boys, Ari Up, the Clash, the Orb, and many others.  Early life  Rainford Hugh Perry was born on 20 March 1936 in Kendal, Jamaica in the parish of Hanover, the third child of Ina Davis and Henry Perry. His mother had strong African traditions originating from her Yoruba ancestry that she passed on to her son. He later moved to Kingston where he apprenticed at Studio One. Career =Early work= Perry's musical career began in the late 1950s as a record seller for Clement Coxsone Dodd's sound system. As his sometimes turbulent relationship with Dodd developed, he found himself performing a variety of important tasks at Dodd's Studio One hit factory, going on to record nearly thirty songs for the label. Disagreements between the pair due to personality and financial conflicts led him to leave the studio and seek new musical outlets. He soon found a new home at Joe Gibbs's Amalgamated Records. Working with Gibbs, Perry continued his recording career but, once again, financial problems caused conflict. Perry broke ranks with Gibbs and formed his own label, Upsetter Records, in 1968. His first major single \\"People Funny Boy\\", which was an insult directed at Gibbs, sold well with 60,000 copies sold in Jamaica alone. It is notable for its innovative use of a sample (a crying baby) as well as a fast, chugging beat that would soon become identifiable as \\"reggae\\" (the new kind of sound which was given the name \\"Steppers\\"). Similarly his acrimonious 1967 single as Lee \\"King\\" Perry, \\"Run for Cover\\", was likewise aimed at Sir Coxsone. From 1968 until 1972, he worked with his studio band the Upsetters. During the 1970s, Perry released numerous recordings on a variety of record labels that he controlled, and many of his songs were popular in both Jamaica and the United Kingdom. He soon became known for his innovative production techniques as well as his eccentric character. In 1970, Perry produced and released the Wailers track \\"Mr. Brown\\" (1970) with its unusual use of studio effects and eerie opening highlighting his unique approach to production. =The Black Ark= In 1973, Perry built a studio in his back yard, the Black Ark, to have more control over his productions and continued to produce notable musicians such as Bob Marley and the Wailers, Junior Byles, Junior Murvin, the Heptones, the Congos and Max Romeo. He also started the Black Art label, on which many of the productions from the studio appeared. With his own studio at his disposal, Perry's productions became more lavish, as the energetic producer was able to spend as much time as he wanted on the music he produced. Virtually everything Perry recorded in The Black Ark was done using basic recording equipment; through sonic sleight-of-hand, Perry made it sound unique. Paul Douglas mentions: > \\"Scratch had a particular sound and everybody was fascinated by his sound. > He had this way of putting things together; it was just his sound and it > influenced a lot of people. I‚Äôve even gone to the Black Ark with Eric Gale > for that Negril album; I remember myself and Val Douglas, we laid some > tracks there, Eric Gale overdubbed stuff on there, but I honestly don‚Äôt > remember what happened to it.\\" Perry remained behind the mixing desk for many years, producing songs and albums that stand out as a high point in reggae history. By 1978, stress and unwanted outside influences began to take their toll: both Perry and the Black Ark quickly fell into a state of disrepair. Eventually, the studio burned to the ground. Perry has constantly insisted that he burned the Black Ark himself in a fit of rage. =After the Black Ark (1980s and 1990s)= Perry performing in 1998 After the demise of the Black Ark in the early 1980s, Perry spent time in England and the United States, performing live and making erratic records with a variety of collaborators. His career took a new path in 1984 when he met Mark Downie (Marcus Upbeat) with whom he worked on the 1986 album Battle of Armagideon for Trojan. It was not until the late 1980s, when he began working with British producers Adrian Sherwood and Neil Fraser (who is better known as Mad Professor), that Perry's career began to get back on solid ground again. Perry also has attributed the recent resurgence of his creative muse to his deciding to quit drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis. In his earlier days, the act of producing for Perry was a frenzied and ritualistic one where he stated that \\"he blew smoke into the microphone so that the weed would get into the song.\\" Perry stated in an interview that he wanted to see if \\"it was the smoke making the music or Lee Perry making the music. I found out it was me and that I don't need to smoke.\\" In 1998, Perry reached a wider global audience as vocalist on the track \\"Dr. Lee, PhD\\" from the Beastie Boys' album Hello Nasty. =Later career= In 2003, Perry won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album with the album Jamaican E.T. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Perry #100 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. More recently, he teamed up with a group of Swiss musicians and performed under the name Lee Perry and the White Belly Rats, and toured the United States in 2006 and 2007 using the New York City-based group Dub Is a Weapon as his backing band. After meeting Andrew W.K. at SXSW in 2006, Perry invited him to co-produce his album Repentance. The album, released on 19 August 2008 through Narnack Records, featured several guest artists including Moby, Ari Up, producer Don Fleming, drummer Brian Chippendale, and bassist Josh Werner. In 2007, Perry's song \\"Enter the Dragon\\" was sampled on the track \\"Carrots\\" by Panda Bear of Animal Collective. As well, Perry was selected by Animal Collective in 2011 to perform at All Tomorrow's Parties, which the band curated in May 2011. That same year, he recorded Rise Again with bassist and producer Bill Laswell; the album featured contributions from Tunde Adebimpe, Sly Dunbar and Bernie Worrell, and was released on Laswell's M.O.D. Technologies label. In 2008, Perry reunited with Adrian Sherwood on The Mighty Upsetter. Between 2007 and 2010, Perry recorded three albums with British producer, Steve Marshall. The albums featured performances by Keith Richards, and George Clinton. Two of these albums, End of an American Dream (2008) and Revelation (2010), received Grammy nominations in the category Best Reggae Album. Perry in 2009 In 2009, Perry collaborated with Dubblestandart on their Return from Planet Dub double album, revisiting some of his material from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as collaborating on new material with Dubblestandart, some of which also included Ari Up of the Slits. In 2008, leading up to this release, Perry's first foray into the dubstep genre was released on 12\\" vinyl, a collaboration with Dubblestandart and New York City's Subatomic Sound System called \\"Iron Devil\\". That record was followed by several more reggae-oriented dubstep collaborations with Dubblestandart and Subatomic Sound System on digital and vinyl, first Blackboard Jungle volumes 1 and 2 (2009) featuring dancehall vocalist Jahdan Blakkamoore, then Chrome Optimism (2010), which also featured American filmmaker David Lynch. Following that, in 2010, Perry and Ari Up of the Slits collaborated on a limited edition Subatomic Sound System 7\\" called \\"Hello, Hell Is Very Low\\", a rootical dubstep release that would turn out to be one of Ari Up's last recordings and the final release during her lifetime. In 2010, Perry had his first ever solo art exhibition at Dem Passwords art gallery in Los Angeles, California. The show, titled \\"Secret Education\\", featured works on canvas, paper, and a video installation. In 2011, The Upsetter, a documentary film about Perry, narrated by Benicio Del Toro, was released worldwide in theaters after its premiere at the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. The film was directed and produced by American film makers Ethan Higbee and Adam Bhala Lough, and opened in Los Angeles in March 2011. It continued to screen worldwide into 2012, with the DVD, iTunes and Video on Demand release soon following. In 2012, Perry teamed with the Orb to produce The Orbserver in the Star House, which was recorded in Berlin over a period of several months. The album earned critical acclaim, and featured the single \\"Golden Clouds\\", named after the historic property located near Perry's hometown in Jamaica. The recording sessions were filmed by Volker Schaner and were part of the documentary Lee Scratch Perry's Vision of Paradise. In August 2012, it was announced that Perry would receive Jamaica's sixth highest honour, the Order of Distinction, Commander class.Bonitto, Brian (2012) \\"Tosh gets OM\\", Jamaica Observer, 7 August 2012, retrieved 7 August 2012 In 2013, Perry performed at the first Dub Champions Festival in Vienna, a sold-out performance, backed by Dubblestandart with Adrian Sherwood handling the dub mix. Perry also performed at the first two Dub Champions Festivals in New York City in 2011 and 2012, backed by Subatomic Sound System. Perry performed at the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California. Perry is featured as the DJ on the dub and reggae radio station \\"The Blue Ark\\" in Grand Theft Auto V. The station includes a number of dubs by Perry and the Upsetters including \\"Disco Devil\\" and \\"Grumblin' Dub\\". In October 2013, it was announced that Perry will be awarded a Gold Musgrave Medal later that month by the Institute of Jamaica.\\"'Scratch' and 'Chinna' to get Musgrave Medals\\", Jamaica Observer, 4 October 2013.

Perry performing in Saint Petersburg, Russia, August 2015 In 2015, the documentary Lee Scratch Perry's Vision of Paradise had a worldwide release in cinemas as well as on DVD and VOD after premiering at the East End Film Festival in London. The film gives an insight into the spiritual world of Perry, after director Volker Schaner spent more than 15 years filming with the Upsetters, witnessing the building of Perry's \\"Secret Laboratory\\" in Switzerland from the beginning until its destruction by fire in 2015. Shot in Switzerland, Jamaica, London, and Berlin, the movie also shows scenes from Aksum and Lalibela, Ethiopia to provide necessary background information. Over the years, Schaner collected over 100 hours of unique scenes and the both still continue the work, planning to release a sequel. In 2015, Perry worked together with Belgium-based band Pura Vida and released The Super Ape Strikes Again, which was mixed at The Last Ark Studio in Belgium using a combination of vintage gear and modern recording techniques. In September 2015, Perry and Subatomic Sound System launched a 40th anniversary tour for Perry's 1976 album Super Ape. The tour began as part of Dub Champions Festival and continued over the next two years with over 50 dates in North America and some isolated dates in Europe. Nearly every show was sold out on the 2015 and 2016 tours. It culminated with the release of the Super Ape Returns to Conquer album in September 2017 which debuted at #2 on iTunes US reggae chart behind Bob Marley's remastered Legend album, and on #3 on the Billboard reggae chart. Larry McDonald performed as part of the band and on the recorded album. A Kickstarter campaign was organized in 2015 by Emch of Subatomic Sound System to raise funds to build a custom 15-foot tall gorilla similar to the one on the original album cover art. The Kickstarter campaign reached its goal and the gorilla appeared on stage during 2015 and 2016 tour dates. In October 2018, Perry and Subatomic Sound System launched a 45th anniversary tour for the 1973 album Blackboard Jungle Dub, produced by Perry. The tour began in North America and tour posters includes the tag line \\"World's 1st dub album, Live for the first time\\". Rolling Stone published a preview of the tour. 2019 saw the release of The Revelation of Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, a film about the making of his 2010 album Revelation, directed by Steve Marshall for State of Emergency. The film features intimate behind the scenes footage of Perry at work in his home studio in the Swiss alps and an in depth interview. In April 2019, hip hop producer Mr. Green announced that he would be doing a record made out of Perry's famous audio stems. In July 2019, Perry announced that the record is entitled Super Ape vs. Á∑ë: Open Door and that it would release through Tuff Kong Records on August 19, 2019. The record combines over 20 different genres of music and was critically acclaimed. Hypebeast said it was \\"Perry's best work in years\\" and that it \\"pushes boundaries of various genres. The record reached the Top 10 on the iTunes reggae charts and the Top 100 on the billboard reggae charts. Personal life Perry currently resides in Switzerland with his wife Mireille and their two children. He has four other children by the names of Cleopatra Perry, Marsha Perry, Omar Perry and Marvin (Sean) Perry in various parts of the world.

The original line-up consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals, percussion), Kate Pierson (vocals, keyboards), Cindy Wilson (vocals, percussion), Ricky Wilson (guitar), and Keith Strickland (drums, guitar, keyboards). Ricky Wilson died from AIDS-related illness in 1985, and Strickland switched from drums to lead guitar. The band also added touring members for albums and live performances. The group evoked a \\"thrift shop aesthetic\\", in the words of Bernard Gendron, by drawing from 1950s and 1960s pop sources, trash culture, and rock and roll. Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson sometimes use call-and-response-style vocals (Schneider's often humorous sprechgesang contrasting with the melodic harmonies of Pierson and Wilson), and their guitar- and keyboard-driven instrumentation composes their trademark sound which was also set apart from their contemporaries by the unusual guitar tunings used by Ricky Wilson on their earlier albums. The band has had many hits, including \\"Rock Lobster\\", \\"Planet Claire\\", \\"Private Idaho\\", \\"Whammy Kiss\\", \\"Party Out of Bounds\\", \\"Wig\\", \\"Love Shack\\" and \\"Roam\\". History =1976‚Äì1979: Formation and early years= The B-52's were formed in 1976 when vocalist Cindy Wilson, guitarist Ricky Wilson (her elder brother), keyboardist and vocalist Kate Pierson, drummer and percussionist Keith Strickland, and cowbell player, poet and lead vocalist Fred Schneider held an impromptu jam session after sharing a flaming volcano drink at a Chinese restaurant in Athens, Georgia. When they first jammed, Strickland played guitar and Ricky Wilson played congas. They later played their first concert (with Wilson playing guitar) in 1977 at a Valentine's Day party for their friends. The name B-52's comes from a particular beehive hairdo resembling the nose cone of the aircraft, which Pierson and Cindy Wilson wore in performances throughout the band's first decade. Other names the band considered were the \\"Tina-Trons\\" and \\"Fellini's Children\\". Strickland suggested the name after a dream he had had one night, of a band performing in a hotel lounge. In the dream he heard someone whisper in his ear that the name of the band was \\"the B-52s\\". The band's quirky take on the new wave sound of their era was a combination of dance and surf music set apart from their contemporaries by the unusual guitar tunings used by Ricky Wilson and thrift- store chic. Their first single, \\"Rock Lobster\\", recorded for DB Records in 1978, was an underground success, selling over 2,000 copies in total, that led to the B-52's performing at CBGB and Max's Kansas City in New York City. Both this version of \\"Rock Lobster\\" and its B-side \\"52 Girls\\" are different recordings from those on their first album, and the early version of \\"52 Girls\\" is in a different key. The re-recorded version of \\"Rock Lobster\\" was released as a single. In the UK and Germany it was backed with an instrumental version of \\"Running Around\\", a non-album track. (A vocal re-recording of this would appear on their second album, Wild Planet.) The buzz created by the record in the UK meant their first show in London at the Electric Ballroom was packed, and attended by UK pop stars including Sandie Shaw, Green Gartside from Scritti Politti, and Joe Jackson. In Canada, released on the Warner Bros. label, the single went from cult hit to reach the No. 1 position in the RPM- compiled national chart on May 24, 1980. =1979‚Äì1982: The B-52's, Wild Planet, and Mesopotamia= In 1979, the B-52's signed contracts as they flew over to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas to record their debut studio album, with Island founder Chris Blackwell producing. The band were surprised by Blackwell's recording methods; he wanted to keep the sound as close as possible to their actual live sound, so he used almost no overdubs or additional effects.With the Wild Crowd! Live in Athens, GA Released on July 6, 1979, The B-52's contained re-recorded versions of \\"Rock Lobster\\" and \\"52 Girls\\", six originals recorded solely for the album, and a cover of the Petula Clark single \\"Downtown\\". The album was a major success, especially in Australia, where it reached number three on the charts alongside its three singles \\"Planet Claire\\", \\"Rock Lobster\\", and \\"Dance This Mess Around\\". In the US, the single \\"Rock Lobster\\" reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the album itself was certified platinum by the RIAA. In 1980, John Lennon called the B-52's his favorite band, and specifically cited \\"Rock Lobster\\" as an inspiration for his comeback with Double Fantasy. Citation posted at Originally posted January 21, 1997. In April 1980, The B-52's returned to Compass Point Studios to record their follow-up album. Several of the songs for the new album had been concert staples since 1978; the band consciously did not record them for their first album since they already had too many tracks and they wanted a strong second album, knowing that their live performances would make fans look forward to it. Rhett Davies co-produced the album, with more emphasis put on slick production; the album has a slightly more psychedelic and even paranoid sound than that of their debut. Released on August 27, 1980, Wild Planet was well received by critics, most of whom regarded it as a strong second album following the success of their first; many fans consider it their best album. The album reached number eighteen on the Billboard 200 chart in 1980 and was certified gold; \\"Private Idaho\\" became their second Hot 100 entry. On January 26, 1980, The B-52's performed on Saturday Night Live; they also performed at the Heatwave festival (which was promoted as the \\"New Wave Woodstock\\") in Toronto, Canada in August 1980, and appeared in the Paul Simon film One Trick Pony. In July 1981, Party Mix! was released, a six-song collection containing songs from their first two albums remixed and sequenced to form two long tracks, one on each side. In 1981, the band collaborated with Talking Heads' David Byrne to produce a third full- length studio album. Reportedly due to differences with Byrne over the album's musical direction, recording sessions for the album were aborted, prompting the band to release Mesopotamia in 1982 as an EP. In 1991, Party Mix! and Mesopotamia, the latter of which had been remixed, were combined and released together on a single compact disc. It was also in 1982 that the band appeared at the inaugural US Festival. They performed on the first day of the festival alongside Talking Heads, Oingo Boingo, and The Police. =1982‚Äì1987: Whammy!, Bouncing off the Satellites, and death of Ricky Wilson= In December 1982, the band began recording their third album, Whammy!. According to Pierson, Strickland no longer wanted to play the drums, so the band switched to drum machines for this album, with Strickland and Ricky Wilson playing all the music on that album, and the rest of the band providing vocals only. Having originally played guitars, organ, bass guitar and synthesizers, Pierson switched to a mainly vocal role in the studio, but remained behind the keyboards on tour. The band also began experimenting heavily with synthesizers during this period. Released on April 27, 1983, Whammy! reached number 29 on the Billboard 200 chart. \\"Legal Tender\\" reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Singles chart alongside \\"Whammy Kiss\\" and \\"Song for a Future Generation\\". For the Whammy! tour, some tracks featured Strickland on the drums while others used a backing track so that Strickland could come forward and play other parts. This also freed up the vocalists (now sometimes not playing instruments) to perform some simple choreography. Copyright issues with Yoko Ono led to the cover song \\"Don't Worry\\" being replaced by \\"Moon 83\\" ‚Äî a rearranged version of \\"There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)\\" from their debut album ‚Äî on future pressings of Whammy!. In January 1985, the band performed in Brazil at Rock in Rio, their largest crowd ever. Having taken a one-year break, the band struggled to write new material for their next album. They all lived together in the same house, and felt that collaboration was not working. They decided to try to write songs separately, and began recording in July 1985, again using drum machines and extensive synthesizers. During the recording, guitarist Wilson had been suffering from AIDS, though none of the other band members were aware of his illness except for Strickland, as he \\"did not want anyone to worry about him or fuss about him.\\" Wilson died from his illness on October 12, 1985, at the age of 32. When the band returned to the studio, Strickland had learned how to play the guitar in Wilson's unique style and switched permanently to the new instrument, leaving session players to complete the rhythm section. The results were released on September 8, 1986, as Bouncing off the Satellites, a mixture of solo efforts and group efforts. Because of Wilson's death, the band did not tour to promote the album. A music video was made for \\"Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland\\" and the band appeared on some UK television programs but then took a two-year hiatus. Cindy Wilson was devastated by her brother's death, and her bandmates were depressed about Ricky's passing. The band went into seclusion and did not tour to promote their album. This was the beginning of an extended hiatus from their musical careers. In 1987, they released a public service announcement in the style of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover on behalf of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. =1988‚Äì1992: Comeback, Cosmic Thing, and Good Stuff= Strickland had been composing in 1988. After he played some of his new music for the other band members, they all agreed to try writing together again, with Pierson, Wilson and Schneider contributing the lyrics and melodies. In 1989, the band released Cosmic Thing, their mainstream breakthrough, released on Reprise Records worldwide. The single \\"Channel Z\\" from the new album became an alternative and college radio hit, hitting number one on the U.S. Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, receiving significant airplay on MTV's modern rock show 120 Minutes. They then embarked on the Cosmic Tour. The next single, \\"Love Shack\\", with its party vibe and colorful music video,Unterberger, pp. 133‚Äì135 became their first top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, ultimately reaching No. 3 in November 1989. That peak was matched in March 1990 when their follow-up single, \\"Roam\\", also reached No. 3. In Australia, the country that had most embraced the band a decade earlier, \\"Love Shack\\" stayed at number one for eight weeks. A fourth single, \\"Deadbeat Club\\", which reminisced about the band's early days in Athens and whose video was shot on location and featured a cameo by fellow Athens artist R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, reached No. 30\\\\. Cosmic Thing climbed into the U.S. top five and earned multi-platinum certification. it also had huge international success reaching No. 1 in both Australia and New Zealand and No. 8 in the UK. The group had a hugely successful world tour to support the record, and appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in March 1990. In 1990, the B-52's were nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. They won two awards, Best Group Video and Best Art Direction. Pierson sang on Iggy Pop's song \\"Candy\\", which gave him a top 40 hit. In 1991, Schneider's solo record was repackaged and re-released, resulting in his first Hot 100 single when \\"Monster\\" climbed to No. 85, and Pierson again guest-starred on a popular track, R.E.M.'s \\"Shiny Happy People\\", which reached No. 10 in September 1991. Pierson also appeared on two other songs from R.E.M.'s chart-topping album Out of Time, \\"Near Wild Heaven\\", and \\"Me in Honey\\", as well as the outtake \\"Fretless\\". In late 1990 Cindy Wilson took time off from the band, with Julee Cruise filling in for her on tour. The B-52's released Good Stuff in 1992 as a trio ‚Äì the only release on which Cindy Wilson was not present ‚Äì and the title track reached No. 28 in August of that year. The album made it to No. 16 in the U.S. It is also the group's most overtly political album, though they had been activists and fundraisers for environmental, AIDS and animal rights causes for many years. =1993‚Äì2007: Hiatus from studio material= The band had their next chart entry in 1994 when, as The BC-52's, they appeared in The Flintstones live- action movie and sang the title song. When released as a single, it reached No. 33 in the U.S. and No. 3 in the UK. In 1994, Pierson and Schneider also sang on the theme song for the Nickelodeon series Rocko's Modern Life from the second season on. In the 1990s, former Duran Duran drummer Sterling Campbell joined the band, but left in 2000 to tour with David Bowie and was replaced that year by Zachary Alford, who had recorded and toured with the band during the Cosmic Thing era. Pierson and Cindy Wilson recorded the song \\"Ain't no Stopping us Now\\" for the 1996 film The Associate starring Whoopi Goldberg. Wilson rejoined the B-52's the same year. A career retrospective, Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation, appeared in 1998 along with two remixed maxi-singles \\"Summer of Love '98\\" and \\"Hallucinating Pluto\\". A major tour (with co-headliners the Pretenders) to promote the collection took place. \\"Debbie\\", another single from the album (a tribute to Blondie's Debbie Harry), placed 35 on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks. In 1999, they recorded a parody of \\"Love Shack\\" called \\"Glove Slap\\" for an episode of The Simpsons. They co-headlined another major tour in 2000 with the Go-Go's. In 2000, the band recorded the song \\"The Chosen One\\" for the movie Pok√©mon: The Movie 2000.[ Allmusic entry for \\"The Chosen One\\"] A more extensive anthology, Nude on the Moon: The B-52's Anthology, appeared in 2002. In February of that year, the band held a series of concerts celebrating their 25th anniversary. The Irving Plaza show in New York City had Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz of Talking Heads and Yoko Ono as guests with Chicks on Speed as the opener. Coinciding with the band's 25th anniversary was the publication of \\"The B-52's Universe: The Essential Guide to the World's Greatest Party Band\\", the first and only officially authorized biography of the band. The book was nominated for a Lambda Lit Award and was a Minnesota Book Awards finalist. The B-52's recorded the song \\"Orange You Glad It's Summer\\" for a Target commercial that aired in spring/summer 2002. Target also used the song \\"Junebug\\" in a TV spot five years later. In late 2004, the band opened for Cher on a few dates of her Farewell Tour. In March 2006, they opened for The Rolling Stones at a benefit for the Robin Hood Foundation. They had three remix EPs released by Planet Clique: Whammy! in 2005, Mesopotamia in 2006, and Wild Planet in 2007. During this time span, they appeared on many television shows including The L Word, V.I.P., The Rosie O'Donnell Show, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the Late Show with David Letterman, The Arsenio Hall Show, Saturday Night Live, Live with Regis and Kelly, The Today Show, Good Morning America and numerous times on VH1. =2008‚Äìpresent: Funplex and continued touring= In 2008, the band dropped the apostrophe from their name to become \\"The B-52s\\". Funplex, the band's first original album in 16 years (since 1992's Good Stuff), was released on March 25, 2008, by Astralwerks. Talking about the record's sound, Strickland noted, \\"It's loud, sexy rock and roll with the beat turned up to hot pink.\\"Rolling Stone First B-52s Album in 16 Years October 24, 2007 The album is produced by Steve Osborne, who was asked to work on the album based on his work with New Order on the album Get Ready. The album debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard charts in the U.S., immediately making it the second-highest charting B-52s album ever. The band toured in support of the album as well as making appearances on talk shows, including The Tonight Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and performing on The Today Show on Memorial Day 2008. They also participated in the True Colors Tour 2008 with Cyndi Lauper and embarked on a European tour in July. The first single from the album was \\"Funplex\\", which was released digitally on January 29 to the iTunes Store in the U.S. The second single lifted from the album was \\"Juliet of the Spirits\\". Schneider said in an interview that the album just broke even and could be the B-52s' last new studio album, though he later retracted that statement. The B-52s performed their hit track \\"Love Shack\\" with Sugarland at the 2009 CMT Music Awards. On February 18, 2011, the B-52s played a show at the Classic Center in their hometown of Athens, Georgia, four days after the 34th anniversary of their first-ever show on February 14, 1977. The concert was filmed and recorded for With the Wild Crowd! Live in Athens, GA, released in October 2011. The group continued to perform live, with a touring band including musicians Sterling Campbell (drums), Paul Gordon (keyboards, guitar) and Tracy Wormworth (bass), including the closing show for the 2011 edition of the Montreal Jazz Festival, and as the house band during the 2012 TV Land Awards. At the end of 2012, Strickland announced he would no longer tour with the B-52s, though he would continue as a member of the band. Without Strickland, the B-52's continued to tour across the world with groups including The Go- Go's, Tears for Fears, The English Beat, The Psychedelic Furs, Simple Minds, Boy George and Culture Club and Thompson Twins' Tom Bailey. Aside from touring, the group covered the Squidbillies theme song during Season 10 of the Adult Swim series and appeared as guests in the sketch comedy show Portlandia. During 2019, the group announced a tour starting in May in the States, taking in Europe, and back to the States through the fall. On September 30, 2019, the band is featured on the Archie Comics' comic book Archie Meets the B-52s, was released in February 2020.

The band was founded by Chris Bailey (singer-songwriter, later guitarist), Ivor Hay (drummer), and Ed Kuepper (guitarist-songwriter). Contemporaneously with American punk rock band the Ramones, the Saints were employing the fast tempos, raucous vocals and \\"buzz saw\\" guitar that characterised early punk rock. With their debut single, \\"(I'm) Stranded\\", in September 1976, they became the first \\"punk\\" band outside the US to release a record, ahead of better-known acts including the Sex Pistols and the Clash. They are one of the first and most influential groups of the genre. Alongside mainstay Bailey, the group has also had numerous line-ups - in early 1979, Ivor Hay and Ed Kuepper left, while Bailey continued the band, with a changing line-up. All Fools Day peaked in the Top 30 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart in April 1986. Bailey also has a solo career and had relocated to Sweden by 1994. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2001. The Saints continue to record and perform. In 2014 Bruce Springsteen covered their song \\"Just Like Fire Would\\" on his High Hopes album. History =1973‚Äì1976: Formative years= The Saints' original members were Brisbane schoolmates Chris Bailey (singer-songwriter, later guitarist), Ed Kuepper (guitarist-songwriter), and Ivor Hay (drummer). They had formed Kid Galahad and the Eternals in 1973 with Irish-raised Bailey on vocals, Brisbane- born Hay on piano and German-born Kuepper on guitar. Their musical inspirations came from 1950s rock 'n' roll musicians such as Little Richard and Elvis Presley (their name referenced his 1962 film, Kid Galahad) and 1960s proto-punk bands like the Missing Links, the Stooges and MC5. They rehearsed in a shed at the back of Hay's place, which was opposite the local police headquarters. The band renamed themselves the Saints in 1974, inspired by Leslie Chateris' character The Saint. They played covers of Del Shannon, Connie Francis and Ike and Tina Turner ‚Äì \\"exploding them almost beyond recognition with energy\\". Jeffrey Wegener joined on drums and Hay switched to bass guitar. Wegener had left by 1975, Hay moved to drums and Kym Bradshaw joined on bass guitar. Contemporaneous with Ramones, the group were employing the fast tempos, raucous vocals and \\"buzz saw\\" guitar that characterised early punk rock. Kuepper explained that they played faster and faster as they were nervous in front of audiences. The police would often break up their gigs, and arrests were frequent. Unable to obtain bookings, Bailey and Hay converted the Petrie Terrace house they shared into the 76 Club so they had a venue to play in. According to Australian rock historian, Ian McFarlane, they had developed their \\"own distinctive sound as defined by Kuepper's frenetic, whirlwind guitar style and Bailey's arrogant snarl\\". =1976‚Äì1977: (I'm) Stranded= In June 1976, the Saints recorded two tracks, \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" and \\"No Time\\" with Mark Moffatt producing. Unable to find any interested label, they formed Fatal Records and independently released their debut single in September. Their self-owned Eternal Promotions sent discs to radio stations and magazines both in Australia ‚Äì with little local interest ‚Äì and United Kingdom. In the UK, a small label, Power Exchange, issued the single. Sounds magazine's reviewer, Jonh Ingham, declared it, \\"Single of this and every week\\". EMI head office in London contacted the Sydney branch and directed that they be signed to a three-album contract. Over two days in December, the group recorded their first LP, (I'm) Stranded (February 1977), with Rod Coe producing. It included a cover version of the Missing Links' track \\"Wild About You\\". They supported AC/DC in late December 1976 and, early in 1977, relocated to Sydney. EMI re- issued the single, \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" in February and it reached the Kent Music Report Top 100 Singles Chart. The Saints resisted being re-modelled into the English punk look and were generally ignored by the Australian press. Mainstream public was warned that punk rock is \\"a sinister new teenage pop cult, based on sex, sadism and violence, [which] is sweeping Britain.\\" In May 1977, the band released their second single, \\"Erotic Neurotic\\" and then moved to the UK, where they differed with their label over how they should be marketed. EMI planned to promote them as a typical punk band, complete with ripped clothes and spiky hair ‚Äì the Saints insisted on maintaining a more downbeat image. In June, bass guitarist Alasdair \\"Algy\\" Ward replaced Bradshaw. Their next single \\"This Perfect Day\\" (July) peaked at No. 34 in the UK but further improvement was frustrated by EMI's failure to press enough copies to satisfy demand. > \\"They were kind of god-like to me and my colleagues. They were just always > so much better than everybody else. It was extraordinary to go and see a > band that was so anarchic and violent.\\" > > -Nick Cave =1978‚Äì1979: Eternally Yours and Prehistoric Sounds= The Saints released their second album, Eternally Yours, in May 1978 on EMI/Harvest with Bailey and Kuepper producing. The album showed the band moving towards a more R&B; style of rock, including a brass section on songs like \\"Know Your Product\\" which had been released as a single in February. Another track, \\"Private Affair\\", focussed on what the band members saw as the pigeon-holing, hype and commercialisation of punk. The album reached the Top 100 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. The jazz-blues influenced third album, Prehistoric Sounds, followed in October 1978 (January 1979 in Australia). Its commercial failure led EMI to drop the band. During 1978, relations between Kuepper and Bailey had deteriorated, with Bailey preferring rock and pop songs and Kuepper pursuing less commercial and more intellectual material. Finally Hay, Kuepper and Ward left the group in early 1979. Kuepper returned to Australia and followed a more avant-garde direction with Laughing Clowns, which would frequently feature brass, and later, the punkish the Aints. He is one of Australia's most influential and highly regarded musicians with over twenty solo albums to his credit. Hay briefly returned to Australia to join Sydney-based the Hitmen and then rejoined Bailey in London for a later version of the Saints. Ward became a member of English gothic punk band, the Damned. Bailey continued the group with Mark Birmingham on drums, Bruce Callaway on guitar, Barry Francis on guitar and Janine Hall on bass guitar. =1980s: Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow to Prodigal Son= The Saints' first release after Kuepper's departure was the live EP, Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow, in March 1980 on Lost Records with Bailey producing. It was followed by a studio album, The Monkey Puzzle, co-produced by Bailey and Gerry Nixon for Mushroom Records in February 1981. It reached the Top 100 on the Australian Albums Chart. They had shifted to a more melodic pop-rock sound and included Hay on keyboards in the line-up. Hay left again before the next album was released in Australia in 1982 as I Thought This Was Love, But This Ain't Casablanca on Mushroom Records and elsewhere as Out in the Jungle... Where Things Ain't So Pleasant on New Rose Records. Production was credited to Ricardo Mentalban, and with Bailey, in the Saints, were Hall on bass guitar and Iain Shedden (ex-Jolt) on drums. Additional musicians included Roger Crankwell on saxophone and clarinet, Denis Haines on piano, Paul Neiman on trombone, Steve Sidwell on trumpet and Jess Sutcliffe on piano. The Damned's Brian James guested on lead guitar. In late 1982, the group toured Australia with Bailey, Hall and Shedden joined by Chris Burnham on guitar (ex-Supernaut) and Laurie Cuffe on guitar. In 1983, Bailey released his first solo album, Casablanca, on New Rose. In 1984, Bailey was based in Sydney, and the Saints' album, A Little Madness to Be Free, was released in July on RCA with production credited to Lurax Debris (Bailey's pseudonym). It contains the popular track \\"Ghost Ships\\", which was issued as a single in May. A Little Madness to Be Free was \\"more rock-oriented, with extensive use of acoustic guitar, brass and strings set among tightly focused arrangements\\". In mid-1984, the band toured as Bailey, Burnham, Shedden and Tracy Pew on bass guitar, (ex-Birthday Party), who was briefly replaced by Kuepper in July. By 1985, the Saints were Bailey, Richard Burgman on guitar (ex-Sunnyboys) and Arturo 'Archie' Larizza on bass guitar (the Innocents), while Louise Elliot on saxophone and Jeffrey Wegener on drums (both ex-Laughing Clowns) completed the line-up. A live album, Live in a Mud Hut ... Somewhere in Europe, recorded in 1984 with production credited to Mugumbo, was released by New Rose in 1985. Hay returned and, with Bailey, Burgman and Larizza, the group recorded All Fools Day in Wales with Hugh Jones producing. It was issued by Mushroom Records in Australia and Polydor in United States, in April 1986. The album reached the Top 30 in Australia and included a Top 30 single, \\"Just Like Fire Would\\" (March). The group joined the Australian Made Tour in December 1986 ‚Äì January 1987 with other local acts Mental as Anything, I'm Talking, the Triffids, Divinyls, Models, Jimmy Barnes and INXS. Prodigal Son followed in April 1988, which reached the Top 50. The line-up was Bailey, Francis, Larizza, Shedden and Joe Chiofalo on organ. It was produced by Bailey, Brian McGee and Vanda & Young. The single, \\"Grain of Sand\\", from Prodigal Son peaked at No. 11 on the United States Billboard Alternative Songs chart. In March 1989, the Saints had an Australian Top 40 hit with a cover of the Easybeats' song \\"Music Goes 'Round My Head\\", which also featured in the 1988 film Young Einsteins soundtrack. Their version of \\"The Music Goes Round My Head\\" reached No. 19 on the US Alternative Songs chart. =1990‚Äìpresent: later years= The Saints issued a compilation album, Songs of Salvation and Sin 1976‚Äì1988 in 1990 on Raven Records with liner notes penned by Glenn A. Baker. Over the years, Kuepper had grown unhappy with Bailey's ongoing use of the Saints name and, in particular, with Baker crediting Bailey for the band's original creative direction. In April 1991, Kuepper formed the Aints, which performed versions of vintage the Saints' material. The Saints issued Permanent Revolution in 1991 on Mushroom Records, and while Bailey released solo albums, the group went into hiatus. By 1994, Bailey had moved to Sweden where he recorded a solo album, 54 days at sea, and in 1996 issued the Saints' album, Howling, which was produced by the band for Blue Rose Records. Bailey provided vocals, guitars and organ, and was joined by Andreas Jornvill on drums, Joakim T√§ck on bass guitar, Ian Walsh on guitar and Mons Wieslander on guitar. The group toured Australia in February 1997 ‚Äì their first tour there in eight years. Everybody Knows the Monkey followed in May 1998 on Last Call Records with Bailey were Michael Bayliss on bass guitar, Martin Bjerregaard on drums and Andy Faulkner on guitar ‚Äì it was produced by Bailey and Martin Hennel. Mushroom Records celebrated their 25th anniversary with the Mushroom 25 Live concert in November 1998, Bailey performed \\"Ghost Ships\\" and \\"Just Like Fire Would\\", and a duet with Paul Kelly on \\"Wide Open Road\\", as a tribute to David McComb of the Triffids. Spit the Blues Out was issued in 2000 in France by Last Call Records with production credited to Debris. It displayed \\"'60s-era blues-rock\\" and \\"Brit-pop\\" with Patrick Math√© of French label New Rose providing harmonica and guitar. On 11 September 2001, the original line-up of the Saints came together for a one-off reunion when the writer Clinton Walker, a long-time friend and champion of the band, inducted them into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. By 2005, the group had re- located to Amsterdam, Netherlands, with Bailey were the line-up of Marty Willson-Piper on guitar, Caspar Wijnberg on bass guitar and Pete Wilkinson on drums. They issued Nothing Is Straight in My House in 2005 and after Willson- Piper left they released Imperious Delirium in 2006. They undertook a European tour to promote it and continued to tour America through late 2007. On 14 July 2007, Bailey, Kuepper and Hay re-united for another one-off gig at the Queensland Music Festival, with current member Wijnberg on bass guitar. In January 2009, as part of the All Tomorrows Parties touring festival ‚Äì curated by Mick Harvey, the Saints with Bailey, Hay, Kuepper and LaRizza played shows in Brisbane, Sydney and in Mount Buller, Victoria. This was followed by a Melbourne show on 14 January as part of the Don't Look Back sideshow concerts, where they performed the I'm Stranded album in its entirety. In 2010 the band returned to a three piece with Wilkinson returning as drummer and to the line- up with addition of a new bassist Jane Mack. In May 2010, Kuepper & Bailey reunited for a monthlong tri-residency series of shows in Brisbane, Sydney & Melbourne. With Kuepper on electric guitar/vocals and Bailey on acoustic guitar/bass guitar/vocals, they played a selection of songs from early Saints, both solo careers and post-Kuepper Saints, as well as a few covers. 2012 saw the recording of \\" King of the Sun\\". The album was recorded at the Trackdown studios in Sydney, where Bailey had previously recorded \\"Savage Entertainment\\". Released in Australia in late 2012, \\"King of the Sun\\" was delayed in European countries until April 2013. On 7 November 2013, the Saints appeared as a 4-piece at the Borderline club in London, England. Alongside Bailey were stalwart Saints Barrington Francis and Peter Wilkinson. The band was augmented with Chris Dunne on keyboards. Influence The Saints are one of the first and most influential punk rock groups. According to Bob Geldof, \\"Rock music in the seventies was changed by three bands‚Äîthe Sex Pistols, the Ramones and the Saints\\". In May 2001, Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary and named \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" in its Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in September. In 2007, \\"I'm Stranded\\" was one of the first 20 songs stored on the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry. Their d√©but album, (I'm) Stranded was listed at No. 20 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums, in October 2010. Their third album, Prehistoric Sounds, also appeared in the list, at No. 41.

His best-known work, \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues‚Äù, has been recorded by many artists. Biography Lewis was born in Chicago, though some sources state Louisville, Kentucky, on September 4, 1905 (September 3 and 13 have also been cited as his date of birth in various sources). In his youth he was influenced by the pianist Jimmy Yancey. His father, a guitarist who made two recordings of his own, introduced Meade to music and arranged for him to have violin lessons. He gave up the violin at age 16, shortly after his father's death, and switched to the piano. The nickname \\"Lux\\" was given to him by his boyhood friends. He would imitate a couple of characters from a popular comic strip in Chicago, Alphonse and Gaston, and stroke an imaginary beard as part of the routine. His friends started calling him the Duke of Luxembourg because of this, and the name stuck for the rest of his life. He became friends with Albert Ammons during childhood, a friendship that would last throughout their lives. They went to the same school together briefly, and they practiced and learned the piano together on the Ammons family piano. A 1927 rendition of \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues‚Äù, released by Paramount Records, marked his recording debut. He remade it for Parlophone in 1935 and for Victor in 1937, and a recording exists of a radio show, Camel Caravan, broadcast from New York City in 1939, which includes \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues‚Äù. His performance at John Hammond's historic From Spirituals to Swing concert at Carnegie Hall in 1938 brought Lewis to public attention. Following the event, Lewis and two other performers from that concert, Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson, often appeared as a trio and became the leading boogie-woogie pianists of the day. They had an extended engagement at Caf√© Society, toured as a trio, and inspired the formation of Blue Note Records in 1939. Their success led to a decade-long boogie-woogie craze, with big-band swing treatments by Tommy Dorsey, Will Bradley, and others; and numerous country boogie and early rock-and-roll songs. Lewis appeared in the movies New Orleans (1947) and Nightmare (1956). He also appeared, uncredited, in the movie It's a Wonderful Life, playing piano in the scene where George Bailey gets thrown out of Nick's Bar. Lewis was fond of the Minneapolis area, where a niece lived, and would visit as often as he could. He appeared annually at the White House Restaurant (no longer extant) in Golden Valley. He began a successful three- week engagement there in May 1964. Around 2 a.m. on Sunday, June 7, Lewis left the parking lot of the White House and headed east on Olson Memorial Highway, when his Chrysler Imperial was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by one Ronald Bates, who was traveling an estimated 80 mph. Lewis's car was pushed 400 feet and crashed into a tree; he was killed instantly. He was 58. Bates survived, but his passenger died the following day. Legacy Lewis' best-known work, \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues‚Äù, has been recorded in various contexts, often in a big band arrangement. Early recordings of the piece by artists other than Lewis include performances by Adrian Rollini, Frankie Trumbauer, classical harpsichordist Sylvia Marlowe, theater organist George Wright (with drummer Cozy Cole, under the title \\"Organ Boogie\\"), and Bob Zurke with Bob Crosby's orchestra. Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer often included it in his repertoire and had a Top 30 hit with it in 1976. Lewis was mentioned in Chapter 81 of author Kurt Vonnegut's novel Cat's Cradle. Lewis is also mentioned in Ross Macdonald's novel The Moving Target and in Keith Richards's autobiography Life. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Meade Lux Lewis among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

History Eyring, a third- generation member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was reared on a cattle ranch in Colonia Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, a Mormon colony, for the first 11 years of his life. His father practiced plural marriage; he was married to two daughters of Miles Park Romney, the great- grandfather of Mitt Romney. Eyring's father treated both wives with equal respect and care and made sure to provide the children with a healthy family environment. In July 1912, the Eyrings and about 4,200 other immigrants were driven out of Mexico by violent insurgents during the Mexican Revolution and moved to El Paso, Texas. After living in El Paso for approximately one year, the Eyrings relocated to Pima, Arizona, where he completed high school and showed a special aptitude for mathematics and science. He also studied at Gila Academy in Thatcher, Arizona, now Eastern Arizona College. One of the pillars at the front of the main building still bears his name, along with that of his brother-in-law, Spencer W. Kimball, later president of the LDS Church. By 1919, Eyring had received a state fellowship to the University of Arizona, where he received degrees in mining engineering, metallurgy, and chemistry. He subsequently pursued and received his doctoral degree in Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1927 for a thesis entitled: A Comparison of the Ionization by, and Stopping Power for, Alpha Particles of Elements and Compounds. After a review of his dissertation, Princeton University recruited Eyring as an instructor in 1931. He would continue his work at Princeton until 1946AAAS - The World's Largest General Scientific Society when he was offered a position as dean of the graduate school at the University of Utah. The chemistry building on the University of Utah campus is now named in his honor. A prolific writer, he authored more than 600 scientific articles, ten scientific books, and a few books on the subject of science and religion. He received the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1980 and the National Medal of Science in 1966 for developing the Absolute Rate Theory or Transition state theory of chemical reactions, one of the most important developments of 20th-century chemistry. Several other chemists later received the Nobel Prize for work based on it, and his failure to receive the Nobel was a matter of surprise to many.G.B. Kauffman; The Nobel Centennial 1901‚Äî2001; Chem. Educator 2001, 6, 370‚Äî384 The Nobel Prize organization admitted that \\"Strangely, Eyring never received a Nobel Prize\\"; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences apparently did not understand Eyring's theory until it was too late to award him the Nobel. The academy awarded him the Berzelius Medal in 1977 as partial compensation.\\"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry: The Development of Modern Chemistry\\". Nobelprize.org. Retrieved 12 Jun 2010. Sterling M. McMurrin believed Eyring should have received the Nobel Prize but was not awarded it because of his religion.\\"Matters of Conscience: Conversations With Sterling M. McMurrin on Philosophy, Education, and Religion\\" by Sterling M. McMurrin & L. Jackson Newell, Signature Books, 1996 Eyring was elected president of the American Chemical Society in 1963 and the Association for the Advancement of Science in 1965. Personal life Eyring married Mildred Bennion. She was a native of Granger, Utah, who had a degree from the University of Utah and served as head of the physical education department there. She met Eyring while pursuing a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin.Gerald N. Lund, \\"Elder Henry B. Eyring: Molded by Defining Influences\\", Ensign, September 1995. They had three sons together. The oldest, Edward M. \\"Ted\\" Eyring is an emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of Utah. The second son, Henry B. Eyring is a general authority of the LDS Church, while the youngest son Harden B. Eyring is a higher education administrator for the State of Utah. His wife, Mildred, died June 25, 1969, in Salt Lake City, Utah. On August 13, 1971, he married Winifred Brennan in the LDS Church's Salt Lake Temple. Eyring was a member of the LDS Church throughout his life. His views of science and religion were captured in this quote: \\"Is there any conflict between science and religion? There is no conflict in the mind of God, but often there is conflict in the minds of men.\\" Eyring also feared overeager defenders of faith would discard new scientific findings because of apparent contradictions. He encouraged parents and teachers to distinguish between \\"what they know to be true and what they think may be true,\\" to avoid clumping them together and \\"throwing the baby out with the bath.\\" As a member of the LDS Church, Eyring served as a branch president, district president, and, for over twenty years, a member of the general board of the Deseret Sunday School Union. His son, Henry B. Eyring, is currently an apostle and member of the church's First Presidency.

Ostrogradsky was a student of Timofei Osipovsky and is considered to be a disciple of Leonhard Euler, who was known as one of the leading mathematicians of Imperial Russia.  Life  Ostrogradsky was born on September 24, 1801 in the village of Pashennaya (at the time in the Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, today in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine). From 1816 to 1820, he studied under Timofei Osipovsky (1765‚Äì1832) and graduated from the University of Kharkiv. When Osipovsky was suspended on religious grounds in 1820, Ostrogradsky refused to be examined and he never received his Ph.D. degree. From 1822 to 1826, he studied at the Sorbonne and at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, France. In 1828, he returned to the Russian Empire and settled in Saint Petersburg, where he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences. He also became a professor of the Main military engineering School of the Russian Empire. Ostrogradsky died in Poltava in 1862, aged 60. The Kremenchuk Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi National University in Kremenchuk, Poltava oblast, as well as Ostrogradsky street in Poltava, are named after him.  Work  A 2 hryvna commemorative coin minted by the National Bank of Ukraine in 2001. Commemorative plaque in Poltava on the last house where Ostrogradsky resided. He worked mainly in the mathematical fields of calculus of variations, integration of algebraic functions, number theory, algebra, geometry, probability theory and in the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical physics and classical mechanics. In the latter, his key contributions are in the motion of an elastic body and the development of methods for integration of the equations of dynamics and fluid power, following up on the works of Euler, Joseph Louis Lagrange, Sim√©on Denis Poisson and Augustin Louis Cauchy. In Russia, his work in these fields was continued by Nikolay Dmitrievich Brashman (1796‚Äì1866), August Yulevich Davidov (1823‚Äì1885) and especially by Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky (1847‚Äì1921).

Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with history stretching back to antiquity. Computational complexity is central to computational geometry, with great practical significance if algorithms are used on very large datasets containing tens or hundreds of millions of points. For such sets, the difference between O(n2) and O(n log n) may be the difference between days and seconds of computation. The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in computer graphics and computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from mathematical visualization. Other important applications of computational geometry include robotics (motion planning and visibility problems), geographic information systems (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), integrated circuit design (IC geometry design and verification), computer-aided engineering (CAE) (mesh generation), computer vision (3D reconstruction). The main branches of computational geometry are: *Combinatorial computational geometry, also called algorithmic geometry, which deals with geometric objects as discrete entities. A groundlaying book in the subject by Preparata and Shamos dates the first use of the term \\"computational geometry\\" in this sense by 1975. * Numerical computational geometry, also called machine geometry, computer-aided geometric design (CAGD), or geometric modeling, which deals primarily with representing real-world objects in forms suitable for computer computations in CAD/CAM systems. This branch may be seen as a further development of descriptive geometry and is often considered a branch of computer graphics or CAD. The term \\"computational geometry\\" in this meaning has been in use since 1971.A.R. Forrest, \\"Computational geometry\\", Proc. Royal Society London, 321, series 4, 187-195 (1971)  Combinatorial computational geometry  The primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects: points, line segments, polygons, polyhedra, etc. Some of these problems seem so simple that they were not regarded as problems at all until the advent of computers. Consider, for example, the Closest pair problem: * Given n points in the plane, find the two with the smallest distance from each other. One could compute the distances between all the pairs of points, of which there are n(n-1)/2, then pick the pair with the smallest distance. This brute-force algorithm takes O(n2) time; i.e. its execution time is proportional to the square of the number of points. A classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes O(n log n). Randomized algorithms that take O(n) expected time,S. Khuller and Y. Matias. A simple randomized sieve algorithm for the closest- pair problem. Inf. Comput., 118(1):34‚Äî37,1995 (PDF) as well as a deterministic algorithm that takes O(n log log n) time,S. Fortune and J.E. Hopcroft. \\"A note on Rabin's nearest-neighbor algorithm.\\" Information Processing Letters, 8(1), pp. 20--23, 1979 have also been discovered. = Problem classes = The core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways, according to various criteria. The following general classes may be distinguished. Static problems In the problems of this category, some input is given and the corresponding output needs to be constructed or found. Some fundamental problems of this type are: * Convex hull: Given a set of points, find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points. * Line segment intersection: Find the intersections between a given set of line segments. * Delaunay triangulation * Voronoi diagram: Given a set of points, partition the space according to which points are closest to the given points. * Linear programming * Closest pair of points: Given a set of points, find the two with the smallest distance from each other. * Largest empty circle: Given a set of points, find a largest circle with its center inside of their convex hull and enclosing none of them. * Euclidean shortest path: Connect two points in a Euclidean space (with polyhedral obstacles) by a shortest path. * Polygon triangulation: Given a polygon, partition its interior into triangles * Mesh generation * Boolean operations on polygons The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space (computer memory) required to solve a given problem instance. Geometric query problems In geometric query problems, commonly known as geometric search problems, the input consists of two parts: the search space part and the query part, which varies over the problem instances. The search space typically needs to be preprocessed, in a way that multiple queries can be answered efficiently. Some fundamental geometric query problems are: * Range searching: Preprocess a set of points, in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region. * Point location: Given a partitioning of the space into cells, produce a data structure that efficiently tells in which cell a query point is located. * Nearest neighbor: Preprocess a set of points, in order to efficiently find which point is closest to a query point. * Ray tracing: Given a set of objects in space, produce a data structure that efficiently tells which object a query ray intersects first. If the search space is fixed, the computational complexity for this class of problems is usually estimated by: *the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in *the time (and sometimes an extra space) to answer queries. For the case when the search space is allowed to vary, see \\"Dynamic problems\\". Dynamic problems Yet another major class is the dynamic problems, in which the goal is to find an efficient algorithm for finding a solution repeatedly after each incremental modification of the input data (addition or deletion input geometric elements). Algorithms for problems of this type typically involve dynamic data structures. Any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one, at the cost of increased processing time. For example, the range searching problem may be converted into the dynamic range searching problem by providing for addition and/or deletion of the points. The dynamic convex hull problem is to keep track of the convex hull, e.g., for the dynamically changing set of points, i.e., while the input points are inserted or deleted. The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by: *the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in *the time and space to modify the searched data structure after an incremental change in the search space *the time (and sometimes an extra space) to answer a query. Variations Some problems may be treated as belonging to either of the categories, depending on the context. For example, consider the following problem. * Point in polygon: Decide whether a point is inside or outside a given polygon. In many applications this problem is treated as a single-shot one, i.e., belonging to the first class. For example, in many applications of computer graphics a common problem is to find which area on the screen is clicked by a pointer. However, in some applications, the polygon in question is invariant, while the point represents a query. For example, the input polygon may represent a border of a country and a point is a position of an aircraft, and the problem is to determine whether the aircraft violated the border. Finally, in the previously mentioned example of computer graphics, in CAD applications the changing input data are often stored in dynamic data structures, which may be exploited to speed-up the point-in-polygon queries. In some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries, which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates. For example, in some cases it is important to know the worst case for the total time for the whole sequence of N queries, rather than for a single query. See also \\"amortized analysis\\".  Numerical computational geometry  This branch is also known as geometric modelling and computer- aided geometric design (CAGD). Core problems are curve and surface modelling and representation. The most important instruments here are parametric curves and parametric surfaces, such as B√©zier curves, spline curves and surfaces. An important non-parametric approach is the level-set method. Application areas of computational geometry include shipbuilding, aircraft, and automotive industries.

The I-16 was introduced in the mid-1930s and formed the backbone of the Soviet Air Force at the beginning of World War II. The diminutive fighter, nicknamed \\"Ishak\\" or \\"Ishachok\\" (\\"donkey\\" or \\"burro\\") by Soviet pilots, figured prominently in the Second Sino-Japanese War,Liss 1966, p. 10. the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, Winter War and the Spanish Civil WarAbanshin and Gut 1994, p. 38.L√©onard 1981, pp. 18‚Äì22. ‚Äì where it was called the Rata (\\"rat\\") by the Nationalists or Mosca (\\"fly\\") by the Republicans. Design and development While working on the Polikarpov I-15 biplane, Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov began designing an advanced monoplane fighter. It featured cutting-edge innovations such as retractable landing gear and a fully enclosed cockpit, and was optimized for speed with a short stubby fuselage, and a Wright R-1820 radial engine in a NACA cowling. The aircraft is small, light and simple to build. Full-scale work on the TsKB-12 prototype began in June 1933, and the aircraft was accepted into production on 22 November 1933, a month before it took to the air. The TsKB-12 was of mixed construction, using a wooden monocoque fuselage and wings employing a KhMA chrome-molybdenum steel alloy wing spar, dural ribs and D1 aluminum alloy skinning on the center and leading edges, with the remaining portions of the wings fabric covered. Another modern feature were the ailerons which ran along almost the entire trailing edge of the wing and also operated as flaps (in the manner of more modern flaperons) by drooping 15¬∞. The cockpit was covered by a 40-centimetre-wide (16 in) canopy which featured an Aldis-type tubular gun sight which could slide back and forth on runners fitted with rubber bungee cords. A 225 l (59.4 US gal) fuel tank was fitted directly in front of the cockpit. The main landing gear is fully retractable by a hand crank. The armament consisted of a pair of 7.62√ó54mmR (0.30 in) ShKAS machine guns in the wings, mounted on the outboard side of the main gear and 900 rounds of ammunition. These features were proposed at first by Andrei Tupolev; however, the NII VVS was more concerned about the stresses a typical combat aircraft was subjected to in combat, and initially considered the risk too great. However, TsAGI, with the help of the 3rd Design Brigade under the leadership of Pavel Sukhoi and Aleksandr Putylov, eventually convinced NII VVS that what was being proposed was not only feasible, but would enhance the aircraft's performance. The TsKB-12 was designed for the Wright Cyclone SR-1820-F-3 9-cylinder radial engine (rated at 529 kW/710 hp); a license to build this engine under the supervision of the OKB-19 Shvetsov design bureau in the Soviet Union was being negotiated. As the license was not yet approved, Polikarpov was asked to settle for the less powerful M-22 (Soviet-built version of the Gnome-Rhone Jupiter 9ASB, which itself was a licensed version of the Bristol Jupiter VI) with 358 kW (480 hp). This was deemed acceptable because the projected top speed still exceeded 300 km/h (185 mph). The M-22-powered TsKB-12 first took to the air on 30 December 1933 with the famous Soviet test pilot Valery Chkalov at the controls. The second TsKB-12, with a Cyclone engine and three-bladed propeller, flew in January of the following year. Initial government trials in February 1934 revealed very good maneuverability, but the aircraft did not tolerate abrupt control inputs. Thus the TsKB-12 was deemed dangerous to fly and all aerobatics were forbidden. The M-22 version was preferred due to the vibration of the Cyclone- powered aircraft. Pilots commented early on about the difficulty of climbing into the cockpit, a trait that persisted through the I-16's service life. Before continuing test flights the designers had to answer the question of spin behavior. Wind tunnel testing suggested that the TsKB-12, with its short tail, would enter an unrecoverable flat spin, but real-life trials were necessary to confirm this. Since Cyclone engines were rare, it was decided to risk the M-22 prototype for this purpose. On 1 and 2 March 1934, Chkalov performed 75 spins and discovered that the aircraft had very benign stall behavior (dipping a wing and recovering without input from the pilot when airspeed increased) and intentional spins could be easily terminated by placing the controls in the neutral position. The stories of vicious spin behavior of the I-16 perpetuated in modern literature is unfounded (perhaps extrapolated from Gee Bee experience). In fact, the I-16's stablemate, the biplane Polikarpov I-153, exhibited much worse spin characteristics. Service trials of the new fighter, designated I-16, began on 22 March 1934. The M-22 prototype reached 359 km/h (223 mph). The pioneering presence of a complex, triple-strut manually retracted main landing gear design was prone to jamming and required considerable strength from the pilot, who directly operated the rearmost strut's upper end, moved with a manually turned jackscrew running spanwise within the wing structure, to \\"slide\\" outwards and inwards on each side to respectively get the main gear retracted and extended, with the main strut (the forward-most of the trio) needing to shorten its length during its retraction to fit the mainwheel into the lower fuselage, performed by the middle-location strut's geometric arrangement and pivot locations.Animation of the I-16's maingear retraction cycle Most of the test flights were performed with the gear extended. On 1 May 1934, the M-22 prototype participated in the flyover of Red Square. Approximately thirty I-16 Type 1 aircraft were delivered, but were not assigned to any VVS fighter squadron. Most pilots who flew the I-16 Type 1 for evaluation purposes did not find the aircraft to have many redeeming characteristics. Regardless of pilot opinion, much attention was focused on the Cyclone-powered aircraft and the M-25 (the license-built Cyclone). On 14 April 1934, the Cyclone prototype was damaged when one of the landing gear legs collapsed while it was taxiing. The third prototype with a Cyclone engine incorporated a series of aerodynamic improvements and was delivered for government trials on 7 September 1934. The top speed of 437 km/h (270 mph) no longer satisfied the Air Force, who now wanted the experimental Nazarov M-58 engine and 470 km/h (290 mph). Subsequently, the M-22-powered version entered production at Factory 21 in Nizhny Novgorod and Factory 39 in Moscow. Because it was the fourth aircraft produced by these factories, it received the designation I-16 Type 4. Aircraft fitted with these new engines required a slightly changed airframe, including armor plating for the pilot and changes to the landing gear doors (particularly, the hinged lower mainwheel door)Animation of the I-16's lower mainwheel door mechanics during retraction to allow for complete closure. The M-25 fitted I-16, the I-16 Type 5, featured a new engine cowling which was slightly smaller in diameter and featured nine forward-facing, radially-set shuttered openings to control cooling airflow, a redesigned exhaust with eight individual outlet stubs, and other changes. The M-25 was rated at 474 kW (635 hp) at sea level and 522 kW (700 hp) at 2,300 m (7,546 ft). Due to the poor quality of the canopy glazing, the I-16 Type 5 pilots typically left the canopy open or removed the rear portion completely. By the time the Type 5 arrived, it was the world's lightest production fighter (1,460 kg/3,219 lb), as well as the world's fastest, able to reach speeds of 454 km/h (282 mph) at altitude and 395 km/h (245 mph) at sea level. While the Type 5 could not perform the high-G maneuvers of other fighters, it possessed superior speed and climb rates, and had extremely responsive aileron control, which gave it a very good roll rate, which led to precision maneuvers in loops and split-Ss. A total of 7,005 single-seat and 1,639 two-seat trainer variants were produced. Operational history Initial service experience revealed that the ShKAS machine guns had a tendency to jam. This was the result of the guns being installed in the wings upside-down to facilitate the fit. The problem was addressed in later modifications. Evaluations from pilots confirmed the experience with prototypes. Controls were light and very sensitive, abrupt maneuvers resulted in spins, and spin behavior was excellent. An aileron roll could be performed in under 1.5 seconds (roll rate over 240 degrees/second). The machine guns were fired via a cable and the required effort, coupled with sensitive controls, made precision aiming difficult. The rear weight bias made the I-16 easy to handle on unprepared airfields because the aircraft was rather unlikely to flip over the nose even if the front wheels dug in. The I-16 was a difficult fighter to fly. The pilots had poor visibility,Jackson 2003 p. 148. the canopy tended to become fouled with engine oil, and the moving portion was prone to slamming shut during hard maneuvers, which caused many pilots to fix it in the open position. The front section of the fuselage, with the engine, was too close to the centre of gravity, and the pilot's cockpit too far to the rear. The Polikarpov had insufficient longitudinal stability and it was impossible to fly the aircraft \\"hands off\\".Jackson 2003, p. 147. I-16 in Spanish Republican colors with \\"Popeye mascot\\" =Spanish Civil War= At the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Republican forces pleaded for fighter aircraft. After receiving payment in gold, Joseph Stalin dispatched around 475Gunston 2003, p. 85. I-16 Type 5s and Type 6s. The first I-16s appeared in Spanish skies in November 1936.Maslov 2010, p. 25. The Polikarpov monoplanes had their baptism of fire on 13 November 1936, when twelve I-16s intercepted a Nationalist bombing raid on Madrid. Soviet pilots claimed four air victories and two German Heinkel He 51 pilots were killed. But the Soviets suffered losses too; the group commander collided with an enemy aircraft and another I-16 pilot crash landed.Maslov 2010, p. 26. The Polikarpovs immediately began dominating the enemy Heinkel He 51 and Arado Ar 68 biplanes and remained unchallenged until the introduction of the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The arrival of the newest Bf 109Bs and the overwhelming numerical superiority of Nationalist fighters were the primary cause of the heavy I-15 and I-16 combat losses suffered throughout 1937.Maslov 2010, p. 30. A number of aviation publications called the new Soviet fighter a \\"Boeing\\" due to the incorrect assumption that it was based on the Boeing P-26's design. The Nationalists nicknamed the stubby fighter Rata (Rat), while the Republicans affectionately called it Mosca (Fly). Combat experience showed that the I-16 had deficiencies; several aircraft were lost after structural failure of the wings which was quickly remedied by reinforced structures. Heavy machine gun bullets could sometimes penetrate the armored backrest and fuel tanks occasionally caught fire in spite of being protected. The hot Spanish summers required the addition of oil radiators, and dust adversely affected the life of the engines. Although some aircraft accumulated up to 400 hours of flying time, the average life of an I-16 was 87 days, of which one sixth was spent on maintenance. The biggest complaint in service was the light armament of only two 7.62 mm (0.30 in) machine guns. This was urgently addressed with the Type 6 which added a third ShKAS in the bottom of the fuselage. The four-gun Type 10 was nicknamed \\"Super Mosca\\" or simply \\"Super\\". The total number of I-16s delivered to Spain from 1936 to 1938 amounted to 276. When the war ended on 1 April 1939, 187 Ratas had been lost in Spain: 112 lost in combat, one shot down by anti-aircraft fire, eleven destroyed on the ground, one force-landed and 62 lost in accidents.Maslov 2010, p. 32. =The Far East and battles at Khalkhin Gol= I-16 with Chinese insignia, flown by Chinese pilots and Soviet volunteers Another 250 I-16 Type 10s were supplied to China. This model added a second set of 7.62 mm (0.30 in) ShKAS machine guns, armor behind the pilot, and had a slightly upgraded 560 kW (750 hp) M-25 engine. In 1939, of the 500 I-16sKotelnikov p. 109 deployed to the fighting at Nomonhan, approximately 112 were lost during the battles of Khalkhin Gol, of which 88 were destroyed in aerial combat, primarily against the all-metal Nakajima Ki-27 Japanese fighters.Nedialkov 2011, p. 141. During test trials in Russia of a captured Ki-27, the aircraft proved superior to the Soviet I-152 (I-15bis), I-153, and the I-16 in aerial combat, as well as having a faster take-off and lower landing speed, requiring shorter airstrips than the I-16, which needed 270 meters to stop and 380 meters for take-off.Nedialkov p. 24, 25, 148 Further attempts were made to upgrade the firepower of the aircraft using 20 mm (0.79 in) ShVAK cannons, making the I-16 one of the most heavily armed fighters of the period,Price 1975, p. 78. able to fire 28 rounds of ammunition in three seconds. Pilots loved the results, but the cannons were in short supply, and only a small number of the I-16 Type 12, 17, 27, and 28 were built. The cannons adversely affected performance, with 360¬∞ turn time increasing from fifteen seconds in the Type 5 to eighteen seconds. The Type 24 replaced the skid with a tailwheel and featured the much more powerful 670 kW (900 hp) Shvetsov M-63 engine. The Type 29 replaced two of the ShKAS guns with a single 12.7 mm (.50 in) UBS. Types 18, 24, 27, 28, and 29 could be fitted to carry RS-82 unguided rockets. The first successful use of air-to-air missiles in air combat was on August 20, 1939. A Ki-27 was hit by an RS-82 rocket launched from a distance of about a kilometer. The shot was fired by Captain N. Zvonarev. A 1939 government study found the I-16 had exhausted its performance potential. The addition of armor, radio, battery, and flaps during the aircraft's evolution exacerbated the rear weight distribution problems to the point where the aircraft required considerable forward pressure on the stick to maintain level flight and at the same time developed a tendency to enter uncontrolled dives. Extension and retraction of the landing flaps caused a dramatic change in the aircraft's attitude. Accurate gunfire was difficult. =Soviet Union= VVS pilots at Khalkhyn Gol in front of their I-16 in August 1939. The pilots nicknamed the aircraft Ishak (Russian: –ò—à–∞–∫, Donkey/Hinny) because it was similar to the Russian pronunciation of \\"I-16\\" (\\"EE- shestnadtset\\"). When Operation Barbarossa erupted on 22 June 1941, 1,635 of 4,226 VVS aircraft were I-16s of all variants, fielded by 57 fighter regiments in frontier areas.Maslov 2010, p. 68. The main assault delivered by the Luftwaffe's Luftflotte 2 (in support of Wehrmacht Army Group Centre) was directed against the Soviet Western Special Military District, that deployed 361 (424 according to other sources) I-16s.Maslov 2010, pp. 68‚Äì69. During the early phase of the campaign the I-16 bases were the main targets for the German aircraft and after 48 hours of combat, of the 1,635 Polikarpov monoplanes in service on 21 June 1941, only 937 were left.Maslov 2010, p. 69. By 30 June the number of I-16s in western front line units had dropped to 873, including 99 that required repairs.Maslov 2010, p. 72. To stem the Luftwaffe aerial assault several I-16 pilots adopted the taran tactic and sacrificed their lives, ramming German aircraft. Its main opponent in the sky in 1941 was the German Messerschmitt Bf 109.Drabkin 2007, p. 142. The I-16 was slightly more maneuverable than the early Bf 109s and could fight the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, or Emil, on equal terms in turns. Skilled Soviet pilots took advantage of the Polikarpov's superior horizontal maneuverability and liked it enough to resist the switch to more modern fighters. The German aircraft, however, outclassed its Soviet opponent in service ceiling, rate of climb, acceleration and, crucially, in horizontal and diving speed, due to better aerodynamics and a more powerful engine. The main versions of the I-16 had a maximum speed of 450‚Äì470 km/h (279‚Äì291 mph), while the Bf 109E had a maximum speed of 560‚Äì570 km/h (347‚Äì353 mph), the more streamlined Bf 109F Friedrich could hit 615‚Äì630 km/h (372-390plus mph). So German pilots held the initiative and could decide if they wanted to chase their opponents, could attack them from above and behind and then gain altitude for a new attack. Meanwhile, Polikarpovs could only defend each other by forming a defensive circle or via horizontal maneuverability. Moreover, in terms of armament, Messerschmitts had a slight edge on the I-16. The Emil carried two wing-mounted 20mm MG FF cannons and two synchronized 7.92 mm MG-17s with a weight of a one-second salvo of 2.37 kg, while the most common version of the I-16 ‚Äì armed with just two synchronized and two wing-mounted 7.62 ShKAS ‚Äì could deliver 1.43 kg of bullets each second.Drabkin 2007, pp. 142‚Äì43. Finally, the ammunition storage on a Messerschmitt exceeded that of the I-16, carrying 1,000 rounds for each machine gun (plus sixty drum-housed rounds for each cannon), while the Polikarpov carried just 450 rounds for each ShKAS gun.Drabkin 2007, p. 143. Around half of all produced I-16s were still in service in 1943, when they were finally replaced. Specially modified I-16s were used in the Zveno parasite aircraft experiments using the Tupolev TB-3 as a mothership. The Luftwaffe was known to have captured some I-16 and UTI-4 two-seat trainers (two of which were marked with the Stammkennzeichen codes DM+HC and DM+HD) and flown from the Erprobungstelle Rechlin central Luftwaffe test facility by Kampfgeschwader 200 (KG 200).Thomas 2004, p. 80. The Luftwaffe was not the only air force able to test its fighters against the I-16; the Japanese captured a few I-16s as well, and the Romanian Air Force also got one when a Soviet pilot defected.Stapfer 1996, p. 46. The Finnish Air Force (FAF) captured some I-16s (along with several other Soviet types). During the Winter War and the Continuation War, the Finns captured six I-16s and one I-16UTI. Two of the captured I-16s and I-16UTIs were put back into flying condition and flight tested.Perttula, Pentti. \\"FAF in Color.\\" saunalahti.fi. Retrieved: 6 September 2009.

Only three aircraft were built in this configuration, all in January 1939. They had serial numbers 19211-19213. They were first used as test platform for the new gun and then delivered to the VVS as I-16SN. They saw action during the Winter War. ;I-16 Type 20 :This designation was first applied to four prototypes built in February 1939 at Factory 21 and armed with Savin‚ÄìNorov (SN) machine guns synchronized to fire through the propeller. This type was however rejected in August 1939, and then the designation reused for the first I-16 version (otherwise the same as the type 10) capable of carrying drop tanks. These 93 l (25 US gal) tanks were designated PSB-21. Eighty aircraft of this specific type were delivered. Additionally, all I-16 types built after January 1940 could use these drop tanks. ;I-16 Type 21 and Type 22 : These were planned to have four synchronized machine guns all firing through the propeller. Type 21 was to use only ShKAS, while type 22 was supposed to use a mixture of ShKAS and SN machine guns. Both types however existed only on paper; no aircraft of these types went into service. ;I-16 Type 23 : Type 10 additionally armed with RS-82 rockets; 35 were built starting in May 1939.

Three rocket racks were mounted in each wing. Additionally, starting in 1941, the external fuel tank hardpoint was changed so that it became multipurpose: it could carry the new type of drop tank, PLBG-100, or a FAB-100 bomb. Wartime photographs from the summer of 1941 show two configurations: one with 6 RS-82 rockets and two FAB-100 bombs and another with four RS-132 rockets. ;I-16 Type 30 :Re-entered production in 1941‚Äì42, M-63 engine. ;I-16TK :Type 10 with a turbocharger for improved high- altitude performance, reached 494 km/h (307 mph) at 8,600 m ( 28,200 ft), did not enter production. ;UTI-1 :Two-seat trainer version of Type 1. ;UTI-2 :Improved UTI-1 with fixed landing gear. ;UTI-4 (I-16UTI) also known as I-16 Type 15 :Two-seat trainer version of Type 5, most with fixed landing gear.

Archived from the original on September 5, 2017.. One of his novels, If Beale Street Could Talk, was adapted into an Academy-Award-winning dramatic film of the same name in 2018, directed and produced by Barry Jenkins. Baldwin's novels, short stories, and plays fictionalize fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures. Themes of masculinity, sexuality, race, and class intertwine to create intricate narratives that run parallel with some of the major political movements toward social change in mid-twentieth-century America, such as the civil rights movement and the gay liberation movement. Baldwin's protagonists are often, but not exclusively, African American, while gay and bisexual men also frequently feature as protagonists in his literature. These characters often face internal and external obstacles in their search for social and self-acceptance. Such dynamics are prominent in Baldwin's second novel, Giovanni's Room, written in 1956, well before the gay liberation movement.

In New York, Jones married a Baptist preacher, David Baldwin, with whom she had eight children, born between 1927 and 1943. Her husband also had a son from a previous marriage who was nine years older than James.\\"James Baldwin Biography.\\" Biography.com. US: A&E; Television Networks. [2014] 2020. The family was poor, and Baldwin's stepfather, whom in essays he referred to as his father, treated him more harshly than his other children. His intelligence combined with the persecution he endured in his stepfather's home drove Baldwin to spend much of his time alone in libraries. By the time Baldwin had reached adolescence, he had discovered his passion for writing. His educators deemed him gifted, and in 1937, at the age of 13, he wrote his first article, titled \\"Harlem‚ÄîThen and Now\\", which was published in his school's magazine, The Douglass Pilot. Baldwin spent much time caring for his several younger brothers and sisters. At the age of 10, he was teased and abused by two New York police officers, an instance of racist harassment by the NYPD that he would experience again as a teenager and document in his essays. His stepfather died of tuberculosis in the summer of 1943, on the day his last child was born, just before Baldwin turned 19. Not only would the day of the funeral be Baldwin's 19th birthday, it would also be that of the Harlem riot of 1943, an event portrayed at the beginning of his \\"Notes of a Native Son\\" essay. =Education= Growing up in Harlem, Baldwin faced many obstacles, one of which was his education. \\"I knew I was black, of course, but I also knew I was smart,\\" he said. \\"I didn't know how I would use my mind, or even if I could, but that was the only thing I had to use.\\" Baldwin attended P.S. 24 on 128th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues in Harlem, where he wrote the school song, which was used until the school closed.DKDMedia. July 30, 2014. . As recounted in \\"Notes of a Native Son,\\" when he was 10 years old, Baldwin wrote a play that was directed by a teacher at his school. Seeing his talent and potential, she offered to take him to \\"real\\" plays. This provoked a backlash from Baldwin's stepfather, as the teacher was white. Baldwin's mother eventually overruled his father, saying \\"it would not be very nice to let such a kind woman make the trip for nothing.\\" When his teacher came to pick him up, Baldwin noticed that his stepfather was filled with disgust. Baldwin later realized that this encounter was an \\"unprecedented and frightening\\" situation for his parents: > It was clear, during the brief interview in our living room, that my father > was agreeing very much against his will and that he would have refused > permission if he had dared. The fact that he did not dare caused me to > despise him: I had no way of knowing that he was facing in that living room > a wholly unprecedented and frightening situation. His middle-school years were spent at Frederick Douglass Junior High, where he was influenced by poet Countee Cullen, a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance and was encouraged by his math teacher to serve as editor of the school newspaper, The Douglass Pilot.\\"James Baldwin  Artist Bios.\\" Goodman Theatre. Chicago. 2020. (Directly preceding him at Frederick Douglass Junior High were Brock Peters, the future actor, and Bud Powell, the future jazz pianist.)

There, along with Richard Avedon, Baldwin worked on the school magazine as literary editor but disliked school because of the constant racial slurs.\\"Richard Avedon.\\" The Daily Telegraph. October 2, 2004. Retrieved September 14, 2009: \\"He also edited the school magazine at DeWitt Clinton High, on which the black American writer James Baldwin was literary editor.\\" =Religion= During his teenage years, Baldwin followed his stepfather's shadow into the religious life. The difficulties in his life, including his stepfather's abuse, led Baldwin to seek solace in religion. At the age of 14, he attended meetings of the Pentecostal Church and, during a euphoric prayer meeting, he converted and became a junior minister. Before long, at the Fireside Pentecostal Assembly, he was drawing larger crowds than his stepfather had done in his day. At 17, however, Baldwin had come to view Christianity as based on false premises, considering it hypocritical and racist, and later regarded his time in the pulpit as a way of overcoming his personal crises. He therefore left the church despite his father's expectation that he should become a preacher. Baldwin once visited Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam, who inquired about Baldwin's religious beliefs. He answered, \\"I left the church 20 years ago and haven't joined anything since.\\" Elijah asked, \\"And what are you now?\\" Baldwin explained, \\"Now? Nothing. I'm a writer. I like doing things alone.\\" Still, his church experience significantly shaped his worldview and writing. In his essay The Fire Next Time, Baldwin reflected that \\"being in the pulpit was like working in the theatre; I was behind the scenes and knew how the illusion was worked.\\"Baldwin, James. [1963] 1993. The Fire Next Time. New York: Vintage Books. p. 37. Baldwin accused Christianity of reinforcing the system of American slavery by palliating the pangs of oppression and delaying salvation until a promised afterlife. Baldwin praised religion, however, for inspiring some Black Americans to defy oppression. He once wrote, \\"If the concept of God has any use, it is to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God can't do that, it's time we got rid of him.\\"Winston, Kimberly. February 23, 2012. \\"Blacks say atheists were unseen civil rights heroes.\\" USA Today.

Capouya gave Baldwin Delaney's address and suggested that he pay him a visit. Baldwin, who at the time worked after school in a sweatshop on nearby Canal Street, visited Delaney at 181 Greene Street. Delaney became a mentor to Baldwin and, under his influence, Baldwin came to believe a black person could be an artist.Baldwin, James. 1985.

While working odd jobs, Baldwin wrote short stories, essays, and book reviews, some of them later collected in the volume Notes of a Native Son (1955). He befriended actor Marlon Brando in 1944 and the two were roommates for a time. They remained friends for over twenty years. Baldwin and Marlon Brando at the Civil Rights March (1963) Emigration James Baldwin, photographed by Carl Van Vechten, 1955 During his teenage years, Baldwin began to realize that he was gay. In 1948 New Jersey, he walked into a restaurant where he knew he would be denied service. When the waitress explained that black people were not served there, Baldwin threw a glass of water at her, which shattered against the mirror behind the bar.Thorsen, Karen, dir. 1989. James Baldwin: The Price of the Ticket (American Masters), edited by S. Olswang. US: Channel Thirteen-PBS. Disillusioned by American prejudice against Black people, as well as wanting to see himself and his writing outside of an African-American context, he left the United States at the age of 24 to settle in Paris. Baldwin wanted not to be read as \\"merely a Negro; or, even, merely a Negro writer.\\"Baldwin, James. 1985. \\"The Discovery of What it Means to be an American.\\" Ch. 18 in The Price of the Ticket: Collected Nonfiction, 1948‚Äì1985. New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 171. He also hoped to come to terms with his sexual ambivalence and escape the hopelessness that many young African American men like himself succumbed to in New York.Baldwin, James, \\"Fifth Avenue, Uptown\\" in The Price of the Ticket: Collected Nonfiction, 1948‚Äì1985 (New York: St. Martin's/Marek, 1985), 206. In Paris, Baldwin was soon involved in the cultural radicalism of the Left Bank. He started to publish his work in literary anthologies, notably Zero, which was edited by his friend Themistocles Hoetis and which had already published essays by Richard Wright. Baldwin lived in France for most of his later life. He also spent some time in Switzerland and Turkey.\\"James Baldwin.\\" MSN Encarta. Microsoft. 2009. Archived from the original on October 31, 2009. During his lifetime as well as since his death, Baldwin was seen not only as an influential African-American writer, but also as an influential emigrant writer, particularly because of his numerous experiences outside the United States and the impact of these experiences on his life and his writing. = Saint-Paul-de-Vence = James Baldwin at home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France The house where James Baldwin lived and died in Saint Paul de Vence, France Baldwin settled in Saint-Paul-de-Vence in the south of France in 1970, in an old Proven√ßal house beneath the ramparts of the famous village. His house was always open to his friends, who frequently visited him while on trips to the French Riviera. American painter Beauford Delaney made Baldwin's house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence his second home, often setting up his easel in the garden. Delaney painted several colorful portraits of Baldwin. Fred Nall Hollis also befriended Baldwin during this time. Actors Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier were also regular house guests. Many of Baldwin's musician friends dropped in during the Jazz √† Juan and Nice Jazz Festivals. They included Nina Simone, Josephine Baker (whose sister lived in Nice), Miles Davis, and Ray Charles, for whom he wrote several songs.Roullier, Alain. 1998. Le Gardien des √¢mes [The Guardian of Souls]. In his autobiography, Miles Davis wrote:Davis, Miles. 1989. Miles, the Autobiography, edited by Q.Troupe. Simon & Schuster. > I'd read his books and I liked and respected what he had to say. As I got to > know Jimmy we opened up to each other and became real great friends. Every > time I went to southern France to play Antibes, I would always spend a day > or two out at Jimmy's house in St. Paul de Vence. We'd just sit there in > that great big beautiful house of his telling us all kinds of stories, lying > our asses off.... He was a great man. Baldwin learned to speak French fluently and developed friendships with French actor Yves Montand and French writer Marguerite Yourcenar, who translated Baldwin's play The Amen Corner. His years in Saint-Paul-de-Vence were also years of work. Sitting in front of his sturdy typewriter, his days were devoted to writing and to answering the huge amount of mail he received from all over the world. He wrote several of his last works in his house in Saint- Paul-de-Vence, including Just Above My Head in 1979 and Evidence of Things Not Seen in 1985. It was also in his Saint-Paul-de-Vence house that Baldwin wrote his famous \\"Open Letter to My Sister, Angela Y. Davis\\" in November 1970.Baldwin, James. November 19, 1970. \\"An Open Letter to My Sister, Angela Y. Davis.\\" via History is a Weapon. Following the death of James Baldwin in 1987, a court battle began over the ownership of his home. Baldwin had been in the process of purchasing his house from his landlady, Mlle. Jeanne Faure. At the time of his death, Baldwin did not have full ownership of the home, although it was still Mlle. Faure's intention that the home would stay in the family. His home, nicknamed \\"Chez Baldwin\\" has been the center of scholarly work and artistic and political activism. The National Museum of African American History and Culture has an online exhibit titled \\"Chez Baldwin\\" which uses his historic French home as a lens to explore his life and legacy. Magdalena J. Zaborowska, Professor of Afro-american and American studies and the John Rich Faculty Fellow at the Institute for the Humanities at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor published a book titled Me and My House: James Baldwin's Last Decade in France in 2018. This book uses photographs of his home and his collections to discuss themes of politics, race, queerness, and domesticity. Over the years, several efforts were initiated to save the house and convert it to an artist residency. None had the endorsement of the Baldwin estate. In February 2016, Le Monde published an opinion piece by Thomas Chatterton Williams, which spurred a group of activists to come together in Paris. In June 2016 American writer and activist Shannon Cain squatted at the house for 10 days in an act of political and artistic protest. Les Amis de la Maison Baldwin grew out of this effort, a French organization whose initial goal was to purchase the house by launching a capital campaign funded by the U.S. philanthropic sector. This campaign was unsuccessful without the support of the Baldwin Estate. Attempts to engage the French government in conservation of the property were dismissed by the mayor of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, Joseph Le Chapelain, whose statement to the local press claiming \\"nobody's ever heard of James Baldwin\\" mirrored those of Henri Chambon, the owner of the corporation that razed his home. Construction was completed in 2019 on the apartment complex that now stands where Chez Baldwin once stood. Literary career Baldwin's first published work, a review of the writer Maxim Gorky, appeared in The Nation in 1947. He continued to publish in that magazine at various times in his career and was serving on its editorial board at his death in 1987.Caf√© de Flore, boulevard Saint-Germain, Paris, May 1919 ‚Äì Here in the large upstairs heated room (SALLE AU 1er ‚Äì CLIMATIS√âE ) in 1952 Baldwin worked on his first novel Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953) = 1950s = In 1953, Baldwin's first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, a semi-autobiographical bildungsroman, was published. His first collection of essays, Notes of a Native Son, appeared two years later. He continued to experiment with literary forms throughout his career, publishing poetry and plays as well as the fiction and essays for which he was known. Baldwin's second novel, Giovanni's Room, caused great controversy when it was first published in 1956 due to its explicit homoerotic content. Baldwin was again resisting labels with the publication of this work. Despite the reading public's expectations that he would publish works dealing with African American experiences, Giovanni's Room is predominantly about white characters.Baldwin photographed by Allan Warren = 1960s = Baldwin's third and fourth novels, Another Country (1962) and Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone (1968), are sprawling, experimental works dealing with black and white characters, as well as with heterosexual, gay, and bisexual characters. Baldwin's lengthy essay \\"Down at the Cross\\" (frequently called The Fire Next Time after the title of the 1963 book in which it was published) similarly showed the seething discontent of the 1960s in novel form. The essay was originally published in two oversized issues of The New Yorker and landed Baldwin on the cover of Time magazine in 1963 while he was touring the South speaking about the restive Civil Rights Movement. Around the time of publication of The Fire Next Time, Baldwin became a known spokesperson for civil rights and a celebrity noted for championing the cause of Black Americans. He frequently appeared on television and delivered speeches on college campuses.Palmer, Colin A. \\"Baldwin, James\\", Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History, 2nd edn, 2005. Print. The essay talked about the uneasy relationship between Christianity and the burgeoning Black Muslim movement. After publication, several Black nationalists criticized Baldwin for his conciliatory attitude. They questioned whether his message of love and understanding would do much to change race relations in America. The book was consumed by whites looking for answers to the question: What do Black Americans really want? Baldwin's essays never stopped articulating the anger and frustration felt by real-life Black Americans with more clarity and style than any other writer of his generation. = 1970s and 1980s = Baldwin's next book-length essay, No Name in the Street (1972), also discussed his own experience in the context of the later 1960s, specifically the assassinations of three of his personal friends: Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Baldwin's writings of the 1970s and 1980s have been largely overlooked by critics, though even these texts are beginning to receive attention. Several of his essays and interviews of the 1980s discuss homosexuality and homophobia with fervor and forthrightness. Eldridge Cleaver's harsh criticism of Baldwin in Soul on Ice and elsewhereCleaver, Eldridge, \\"Notes On a Native Son\\", Ramparts, June 1966, pp. 51‚Äì57. and Baldwin's return to southern France contributed to the sense that he was not in touch with his readership. Always true to his own convictions rather than to the tastes of others, Baldwin continued to write what he wanted to write. As he had been the leading literary voice of the civil rights movement, he became an inspirational figure for the emerging gay rights movement. His two novels written in the 1970s, If Beale Street Could Talk (1974) and Just Above My Head (1979), placed a strong emphasis on the importance of Black American families. He concluded his career by publishing a volume of poetry, Jimmy's Blues (1983), as well as another book-length essay, The Evidence of Things Not Seen (1985), an extended meditation inspired by the Atlanta child murders of the early 1980s. Baldwin also earned many Fellowships to MacDowell.  Social and political activism  Baldwin (right of center) with Hollywood actors Charlton Heston and Marlon Brando at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Sidney Poitier (rear) and Harry Belafonte (right of Brando) can also be seen in the crowd. Baldwin returned to the United States in the summer of 1957 while the civil rights legislation of that year was being debated in Congress. He had been powerfully moved by the image of a young girl, Dorothy Counts, braving a mob in an attempt to desegregate schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Partisan Review editor Philip Rahv had suggested he report on what was happening in the American South. Baldwin was nervous about the trip but he made it, interviewing people in Charlotte (where he met Martin Luther King Jr.), and Montgomery, Alabama. The result was two essays, one published in Harper's magazine (\\"The Hard Kind of Courage\\"), the other in Partisan Review (\\"Nobody Knows My Name\\"). Subsequent Baldwin articles on the movement appeared in Mademoiselle, Harper's, The New York Times Magazine, and The New Yorker, where in 1962 he published the essay that he called \\"Down at the Cross,\\" and the New Yorker called \\"Letter from a Region of My Mind.\\" Along with a shorter essay from The Progressive, the essay became The Fire Next Time. While he wrote about the movement, Baldwin aligned himself with the ideals of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Joining CORE gave him the opportunity to travel across the American South lecturing on his views of racial inequality. His insights into both the North and South gave him a unique perspective on the racial problems the United States was facing. In 1963 he conducted a lecture tour of the South for CORE, traveling to locations such as Durham and Greensboro in North Carolina, and New Orleans, Louisiana. During the tour, he lectured to students, white liberals, and anyone else listening about his racial ideology, an ideological position between the \\"muscular approach\\" of Malcolm X and the nonviolent program of Martin Luther King, Jr.Leeming, David, James Baldwin: A Biography (New York: Henry Holt, 1994), 134. Baldwin expressed the hope that socialism would take root in the United States.Standley, Fred L., and Louis H. Pratt (eds), Conversations with James Baldwin, p. 131. September 1972, Walker: \\"Most newly independent countries in the world are moving in a socialist direction. Do you think socialism will ever come to the U.S.A.? Baldwin: I would think so. I don't see any other way for it to go. But then you have to be very careful what you mean by socialism. When I use the word I'm not thinking about Lenin for example ... Bobby Seale talks about a Yankee Doodle-type socialism ... So that a socialism achieved in America, if and when we do ... will be a socialism very unlike the Chinese socialism or the Cuban socialism. Walker: What unique form do you envision socialism in the U.S.A. taking? Baldwin: I don't know, but the price of any real socialism here is the eradication of what we call the race problem ... Racism is crucial to the system to keep Black[s] and whites at a division so both were and are a source of cheap labor.\\" > \\"It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most > ferocious enemy justice can have.\\" - James Baldwin By the spring of 1963, the mainstream press began to recognize Baldwin's incisive analysis of white racism and his eloquent descriptions of the Negro's pain and frustration. In fact, Time featured Baldwin on the cover of its May 17, 1963 issue. \\"There is not another writer,\\" said Time, \\"who expresses with such poignancy and abrasiveness the dark realities of the racial ferment in North and South.\\" In a cable Baldwin sent to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy during the Birmingham, Alabama crisis, Baldwin blamed the violence in Birmingham on the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, Mississippi Senator James Eastland, and President Kennedy for failing to use \\"the great prestige of his office as the moral forum which it can be.\\" Attorney General Kennedy invited Baldwin to meet with him over breakfast, and that meeting was followed up with a second, when Kennedy met with Baldwin and others Baldwin had invited to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment. This meeting is discussed in Howard Simon's 1999 play, James Baldwin: A Soul on Fire. The delegation included Kenneth B. Clark, a psychologist who had played a key role in the Brown v. Board of Education decision; actor Harry Belafonte, singer Lena Horne, writer Lorraine Hansberry, and activists from civil rights organizations. Although most of the attendees of this meeting left feeling \\"devastated,\\" the meeting was an important one in voicing the concerns of the civil rights movement and it provided exposure of the civil rights issue not just as a political issue but also as a moral issue.Leeming, James Baldwin: A Biography (1994). James Baldwin's FBI file contains 1,884 pages of documents, collected from 1960 until the early 1970s. During that era of surveillance of American writers, the FBI accumulated 276 pages on Richard Wright, 110 pages on Truman Capote, and just nine pages on Henry Miller. Baldwin also made a prominent appearance at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, with Belafonte and long- time friends Sidney Poitier and Marlon Brando. The civil rights movement was hostile to homosexuals.https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&context;=historydiss The only out gay men in the movement were James Baldwin and Bayard Rustin. Rustin and King were very close, as Rustin received credit for the success of the March on Washington. Many were bothered by Rustin's sexual orientation. King himself spoke on the topic of sexual orientation in a school editorial column during his college years, and in reply to a letter during the 1950s, where he treated it as a mental illness which an individual could overcome. The pressure later resulted in King distancing himself from both men. At the time, Baldwin was neither in the closet nor open to the public about his sexual orientation. Later on, Baldwin was conspicuously uninvited to speak at the end of the March on Washington.Anderson, Gary L., and Kathryn G. Herr. \\"Baldwin, James (1924‚Äì1987).\\" Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice. ed. 2007. Print. After a bomb exploded in a Birmingham church three weeks after the March on Washington, Baldwin called for a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience in response to this \\"terrifying crisis.\\" He traveled to Selma, Alabama, where SNCC had organized a voter registration drive; he watched mothers with babies and elderly men and women standing in long lines for hours, as armed deputies and state troopers stood by‚Äîor intervened to smash a reporter's camera or use cattle prods on SNCC workers. After his day of watching, he spoke in a crowded church, blaming Washington‚Äî\\"the good white people on the hill.\\" Returning to Washington, he told a New York Post reporter the federal government could protect Negroes‚Äîit could send federal troops into the South. He blamed the Kennedys for not acting. In March 1965, Baldwin joined marchers who walked 50 miles from Selma, Alabama, to the capitol in Montgomery under the protection of federal troops. Nonetheless, he rejected the label \\"civil rights activist\\", or that he had participated in a civil rights movement, instead agreeing with Malcolm X's assertion that if one is a citizen, one should not have to fight for one's civil rights. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?, Baldwin rejected the idea that the civil rights movement was an outright revolution, instead calling it \\"a very peculiar revolution because it has to ... have its aims the establishment of a union, and a ... radical shift in the American mores, the American way of life ... not only as it applies to the Negro obviously, but as it applies to every citizen of the country.\\" In a 1979 speech at UC Berkeley, he called it, instead, \\"the latest slave rebellion.\\" In 1968, Baldwin signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\", January 30, 1968, New York Post. Inspiration and relationships Richard Wright (1908‚Äì1960) photographed in 1939 by Carl Van Vechten As a young man, Baldwin's poetry teacher was Countee Cullen. A great influence on Baldwin was the painter Beauford Delaney. In The Price of the Ticket (1985), Baldwin describes Delaney as > ... the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist. In > a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, he would have been recognized as my > teacher and I as his pupil. He became, for me, an example of courage and > integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken > many times and I lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow. Later support came from Richard Wright, whom Baldwin called \\"the greatest black writer in the world.\\" Wright and Baldwin became friends, and Wright helped Baldwin secure the Eugene F. Saxon Memorial Award. Baldwin's essay \\"Notes of a Native Son\\" and his collection Notes of a Native Son allude to Wright's novel Native Son. In Baldwin's 1949 essay \\"Everybody's Protest Novel\\", however, he indicated that Native Son, like Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, lacked credible characters and psychological complexity, and the friendship between the two authors ended.Michelle M. Wright, \\"'Alas, Poor Richard!': Transatlantic Baldwin, The Politics of Forgetting, and the Project of Modernity\\", Dwight A. McBride (ed.), James Baldwin Now, New York University Press, 1999, p. 208. Interviewed by Julius Lester, however, Baldwin explained, \\"I knew Richard and I loved him. I was not attacking him; I was trying to clarify something for myself.\\" In 1965, Baldwin participated in a debate with William F. Buckley, on the topic of whether the American dream had been achieved at the expense of African Americans. The debate took place at The Cambridge Union in the UK. The spectating student body voted overwhelmingly in Baldwin's favour. In 1949 Baldwin met and fell in love with Lucien Happersberger, a boy aged 17, though Happersberger's marriage three years later left Baldwin distraught.Winston Wilde, Legacies of Love, p. 93. Happersberger died on August 21, 2010, in Switzerland. Baldwin was a close friend of the singer, pianist, and civil rights activist Nina Simone. With Langston Hughes and Lorraine Hansberry, Baldwin helped awaken Simone to the Civil Rights Movement. Baldwin also provided her with literary references influential on her later work. Baldwin and Hansberry met with Robert F. Kennedy, along with Kenneth Clark and Lena Horne and others in an attempt to persuade Kennedy of the importance of civil rights legislation. Baldwin influenced the work of French painter Philippe Derome, whom he met in Paris in the early 1960s. Baldwin also knew Marlon Brando, Charlton Heston, Billy Dee Williams, Huey P. Newton, Nikki Giovanni, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Genet (with whom he campaigned on behalf of the Black Panther Party), Lee Strasberg, Elia Kazan, Rip Torn, Alex Haley, Miles Davis, Amiri Baraka, Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothea Tanning, Leonor Fini, Margaret Mead, Josephine Baker, Allen Ginsberg, Chinua Achebe and Maya Angelou. He wrote at length about his \\"political relationship\\" with Malcolm X. He collaborated with childhood friend Richard Avedon on the 1964 book Nothing Personal. Maya Angelou called Baldwin her \\"friend and brother,\\" and credited him for \\"setting the stage\\" for her 1969 autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Baldwin was made a Commandeur de la L√©gion d'Honneur by the French government in 1986. Baldwin was also a close friend of Nobel Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison. Upon his death, Morrison wrote a eulogy for Baldwin that appeared in The New York Times. In the eulogy, entitled \\"Life in His Language,\\" Morrison credits Baldwin as being her literary inspiration and the person who showed her the true potential of writing.

McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. Fred Nall Hollis took care of James Baldwin on his deathbed. Nall had been friends with Baldwin from the early 1970s because Baldwin would buy him drinks at the Caf√© de Flore. Nall recalled talking to Baldwin shortly before his death about racism in Alabama. In one conversation, Nall told Baldwin that \\"Through your books you liberated me from my guilt about being so bigoted coming from Alabama and because of my homosexuality.\\" Baldwin insisted: \\"No, you liberated me in revealing this to me.\\" At the time of Baldwin's death, he had an unfinished manuscript called Remember This House, a memoir of his personal recollections of civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"McGraw-Hill Drops Baldwin Suit\\". The New York Times, May 19, 1990. Following his death, publishing company McGraw-Hill took the unprecedented step of suing his estate to recover the $200,000 advance they had paid him for the book, although the lawsuit was dropped by 1990. The manuscript forms the basis for Raoul Peck's 2016 documentary film I Am Not Your Negro.Young, Deborah, \\"‚ÄòI Am Not Your Negro‚Äô: Film Review  TIFF 2016\\". The Hollywood Reporter, September 20, 2016. Legacy and critical response Literary critic Harold Bloom characterized Baldwin as \\"among the most considerable moral essayists in the United States\\". Baldwin's influence on other writers has been profound: Toni Morrison edited the Library of America's first two volumes of Baldwin's fiction and essays: Early Novels & Stories (1998) and Collected Essays (1998). A third volume, Later Novels (2015), was edited by Darryl Pinckney, who had delivered a talk on Baldwin in February 2013 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of The New York Review of Books, during which he stated: \\"No other black writer I'd read was as literary as Baldwin in his early essays, not even Ralph Ellison. There is something wild in the beauty of Baldwin's sentences and the cool of his tone, something improbable, too, this meeting of Henry James, the Bible, and Harlem.\\" One of Baldwin's richest short stories, \\"Sonny's Blues,\\" appears in many anthologies of short fiction used in introductory college literature classes. A Baldwin quotation (ultimately misquoted) used in graffiti during 2020's George Floyd protests in Indianapolis. A street in San Francisco, Baldwin Court in the Bayview neighborhood, is named after Baldwin.The Chronicle 12 April 1987, p. 6 In the 1986 work The Story of English, Robert MacNeil, with Robert McCrum and William Cran, mentioned James Baldwin as an influential writer of African American Literature, on the level of Booker T. Washington, and held both men up as prime examples of Black writers. In 1987, Kevin Brown, a photo- journalist from Baltimore, founded the National James Baldwin Literary Society. The group organizes free public events celebrating Baldwin's life and legacy. In 1992, Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, established the James Baldwin Scholars program, an urban outreach initiative, in honor of Baldwin, who taught at Hampshire in the early 1980s. The JBS Program provides talented students of color from under-served communities an opportunity to develop and improve the skills necessary for college success through coursework and tutorial support for one transitional year, after which Baldwin scholars may apply for full matriculation to Hampshire or any other four-year college program. Spike Lee‚Äôs 1996 film Get on the Bus includes a black gay character, played by Isaiah Washington, who punches a homophobic character, saying: \\"This is for James Baldwin and Langston Hughes.\\" In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante included James Baldwin on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). 100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books. . In 2005, the United States Postal Service created a first-class postage stamp dedicated to Baldwin, which featured him on the front, with a short biography on the back of the peeling paper. In 2012, Baldwin was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people. In 2014, East 128th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, was named \\"James Baldwin Place\\" to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Baldwin's birth. He lived in the neighborhood and attended P.S. 24. Readings of Baldwin's writing were held at The National Black Theatre and a month long art exhibition featuring works by New York Live Arts and artist Maureen Kelleher. The events were attended by Council Member Inez Dickens, who led the campaign to honor Harlem native's son; also taking part were Baldwin's family, theatre and film notables, and members of the community. Also in 2014, Baldwin was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \\"made significant contributions in their fields.\\" Also in 2014, The Social Justice Hub at The New School‚Äôs newly opened University Center was named the Baldwin Rivera Boggs Center after activists Baldwin, Sylvia Rivera, and Grace Lee Boggs. In 2016, Raoul Peck released his documentary film I Am Not Your Negro. It is based on James Baldwin's unfinished manuscript, Remember This House. It is a 93-minute journey into black history that connects the past of the Civil Rights Movement to the present of Black Lives Matter. It is a film that questions black representation in Hollywood and beyond. In 2017, Scott Timberg wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times (\\"30 years after his death, James Baldwin is having a new pop culture moment\\") in which he noted existing cultural references to Baldwin, 30 years after his death, and concluded: \\"So Baldwin is not just a writer for the ages, but a scribe whose work‚Äîas squarely as George Orwell's‚Äîspeaks directly to ours.\\" In June 2019 Baldwin's residence on the Upper West Side was given landmark designation by New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission. In June 2019, Baldwin was one of the inaugural fifty American \\"pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\\" inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City‚Äôs Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

Born to a father who was a career criminal, Reid converted to Islam as a young man in prison after years as a petty criminal. Later he became radicalized and went to Pakistan and Afghanistan, where he trained and became a member of al-Qaeda. On 22 December 2001, Reid boarded American Airlines Flight 63 between Paris and Miami, wearing shoes packed with explosives, which he unsuccessfully tried to detonate. Passengers subdued him on the plane, which landed at Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, the closest US airport. He was arrested, charged, and indicted. In 2002, Reid pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court to eight federal criminal counts of terrorism, based on his attempt to destroy a commercial aircraft in flight. He was sentenced to three life terms plus 110 years in prison without parole and was transferred to ADX Florence, a super maximum security prison in Colorado, United States. Background Reid was born in Bromley, London, In an email sent to his mother, Reid stated he was part of the war \\"against unbelief\\" and was sacrificing his life to \\"help remove the oppressive American forces from the Muslim lands\\" to Lesley Hughes, who was of native English descent, and Colvin Robin Reid, a man of mixed race whose father was a Jamaican immigrant. When Reid was born, his father, a career criminal, was in prison for stealing a car. Reid attended Thomas Tallis School in Kidbrooke, leaving at age 16 and becoming a graffiti writer who was in and out of detention. He began writing graffiti under the name \\"Enrol\\" as part of a gang, and ultimately accumulated more than 10 convictions for crimes against persons and property. He served sentences at Feltham Young Offenders Institution and at Maidstone Prison. The next time Reid was imprisoned, in 1992 for three years, for various street robberies, he converted to Islam.Reid reportedly followed a fundamentalist form of Islam known as Salafi, which seeks a return to the roots of the religion and is the predominant form of Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia Islamic radicalisation Upon his release from prison in 1995, he joined the Brixton Mosque. He later began attending the Finsbury Park Mosque in North London, headed at that time by the anti- American cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was described as \\"the heart of the extremist Islamic culture\\" in Britain. By 1998 Reid was voicing extremist views. At the Finsbury Park Mosque he fell under the sway of \\"terrorist talent spotters and handlers\\" allied with al-Qaeda, including Djamal Beghal, one of the leaders of the foiled plan for a 2001 suicide bombing of the American Embassy in Paris. He spent 1999 and 2000 in Pakistan and trained at a terrorist camp in Afghanistan, according to several informants. He may also have attended an anti-American religious training centre in Lahore as a follower of Mubarak Ali Gilani. After his return to Britain, Reid worked to obtain duplicate passports from British government consulates abroad. He lived and travelled in several places in Europe, communicating using an address in Peshawar, Pakistan. In July 2001, Reid flew to Israel. Preparation for bombing Reid and Saajid Badat, another British man preparing as a terrorist, returned to Pakistan in November 2001, and reportedly travelled overland to Afghanistan. They were given \\"shoe bombs,\\" casual footwear adapted to be covertly smuggled onto aircraft before being used to destroy them. Later forensic analysis of both bombs showed that they contained the same plastic explosive and that the respective lengths of detonator cord had come from the same batch: the cut mark on Badat's cord exactly matched that on Reid's. The pair returned separately to the United Kingdom in early December 2001. Reid went to Belgium for 10 days before catching a train to Paris on 16 December. On 21 December 2001, Reid attempted to board a flight from Paris to Miami, Florida. His boarding was delayed because his dishevelled physical appearance aroused the suspicions of the airline passenger screeners. In addition, Reid did not answer all of their questions, and had not checked any luggage for the transatlantic flight. Additional screening by the French National Police resulted in Reid's being re-issued a ticket for a flight on the following day. He returned to the Paris airport on 22 December 2001, and boarded American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami, wearing his special shoes packed with plastic explosives in their hollowed-out bottoms. Bombing attempt on American Airlines Flight 63 One of Reid's shoes On 22 December 2001, a passenger on Flight 63 from Paris to Miami complained of a smoke smell in the cabin shortly after a meal service. One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, thinking she smelled a burnt match, walked along the aisles of the plane, trying to assess the source. A passenger pointed to Reid, who was sitting alone near a window and attempting to light a match. Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane. Reid promised to stop. A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaned over in his seat. After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. Several passengers worked together to subdue the 6 foot 4 inch (193 cm) tall Reid who weighed 215 pounds (97 kg). They restrained him using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, leather waist belts and headphone cords. A doctor on board administered a tranquilizer to him which he found in the emergency medical kit of the airliner. The flight was immediately diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, the closest US airport. The explosive apparently did not detonate due to the delay in the take-off of Reid's flight. The rainy weather, along with Reid's foot perspiration, caused the fuse to be too damp to ignite. Legal proceedings and sentencing Reid is incarcerated at USP Florence ADMAX, pictured here Reid was immediately arrested at Logan International Airport after the incident. Two days later, he was charged before a federal court in Boston with \\"interfering with the performance of duties of flight crew members by assault or intimidation\\", a crime which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Additional charges were added when he was formally indicted by a grand jury. The judge ordered Reid held in jail without bail, pending trial due to the gravity of the crimes and the perceived high risk that he would try to flee. Officials at the time indicated that Reid's shoes contained 10ounces (283g) of explosive material characteristic of C-4, enough to blow a hole in the fuselage and cause the plane to crash. During a preliminary hearing on 28 December, an FBI agent testified that forensic analysis had identified the chemicals as PETN, the primary explosive, and TATP (triacetone triperoxide), a chemical needed to detonate the bomb with a fuse and match. The prosecutor obtained a grand jury indictment and on 16 January 2002, Reid was charged with nine criminal counts related to terrorism, namely: * Attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, * Attempted homicide, * Placing or transporting an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft or public mass transportation vehicle, * Attempted murder, * 2 counts of interference with flight crew members and attendants on an aircraft * Attempted destruction of an aircraft or public mass transportation vehicle * Using a destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and * Attempted destruction of an aircraft * Attempted wrecking of a mass transportation vehicle. The ninth charge, attempted wrecking of a mass transportation vehicle, was dismissed on 11 June 2002, because the Congressional definition of 'vehicle' did not include aircraft. Reid pleaded guilty to the remaining eight counts on 4 October 2002. On 31 January 2003, he was sentenced by Judge William Young to the maximum of three consecutive life sentences and 110 years with no possibility of parole. Reid was also fined the maximum of $250,000 on each count, a total of $2 million. During the sentencing hearing, Reid said he was an enemy of the United States and in league with al-Qaeda.Reid's membership in al-Qaeda was corroborated later in 2003 by informant Mohammed Mansour Jabarah during an interrogation at an American military base. Jabarah said Reid was a member of al-Qaeda who had trained in Afghanistan under the direction of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. When Reid said he was a soldier of God under the command of Osama bin Laden, Judge Young responded: > You are not an enemy combatant, you are a terrorist ... You are not a > soldier in any army, you are a terrorist. To call you a soldier gives you > far too much stature. (points to U.S. flag) You see that flag, Mr Reid? That > is the flag of the United States of America. That flag will be here long > after you are forgotten. Reid reportedly demonstrated a lack of remorse and a combative nature during the hearing, and said that \\"the flag will come down on the day of judgment\\". He is serving his sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX in Colorado, a supermax facility which holds the most dangerous prisoners in the federal system. Conspirators Although Reid had insisted that he had acted alone and had built the bombs himself, forensic evidence included material from another person. In 2005, a British man, Saajid Badat from Gloucester, admitted that he had conspired with Richard Reid and a Tunisian man (Nizar Trabelsi, who is in prison in Belgium), in a plot to blow up two airliners bound for the United States, using their shoe bombs. Badat has said that he had been instructed to board a flight from Amsterdam to the United States. Badat never boarded and withdrew from his part of the conspiracy. Badat did not warn criminal or aviation authorities about Reid. Badat confessed immediately after being arrested by the British police. The detonator cord in Badat's bomb was found by experts to be an exact match for the cord on Reid's bomb, and their explosive chemicals were essentially identical. He had received the bomb-making materials from an Arab in Afghanistan. Badat was sentenced to 13 years in prison by a British judge and has since been released. Changes in airline security procedures As a result of these events, some airlines encouraged passengers departing from an airport in the United States to pass through airport security in socks or bare feet while their shoes are scanned for bombs. In 2006, the TSA started requiring all passengers to remove their shoes for screening. Scanners do not find PETN in shoes or strapped to a person. A chemical test is needed. However, even if the X-ray scanners cannot detect all explosives, it is an effective way to see if the shoe has been altered to hold a bomb. In 2011, the rules were relaxed to allow children 12 and younger and adults 75 and older to keep their shoes on during security screenings. Alleged role in September 11 attacks Captured al-Qaeda terrorist conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui stated at his sentencing hearing in 2006 that Reid was a co-conspirator in the September 11 attacks on the United States, and that Moussaoui and Reid had intended to hijack a fifth aircraft and crash it into the White House in Washington, D.C., as part of the attacks that took place that day. Department of Justice investigators and the federal prosecutors were skeptical of Moussaoui's claim that Reid was involved in the plot. Prison restrictions Reid filed a lawsuit against the restrictions placed on him in prison which controlled his communications with lawyers and other non-prisoners, limited his access to Muslim clerics, and prevented him from joining in group prayer at the prison. In 2009, Reid went on a hunger strike and was force-fed and hydrated for several weeks. It was unknown whether Reid's hunger strike was related to his lawsuit. The Department of Justice, after consulting with its counterterrorism section, the prosecuting US attorney's office, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, allowed Reid's prison restrictions to expire in 2009, rather than renewing them, making his lawsuit moot.

The film is playing on the screen to act as a reference. A film score is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also, usually includes pre-existing music, dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question.Savage, Mark. \\"Where Are the New Movie Themes?\\" BBC, July 28, 2008. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians ‚Äì most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists ‚Äì known as playback singers and recorded by a sound engineer. Film scores encompass an enormous variety of styles of music, depending on the nature of the films they accompany. The majority of scores are orchestral works rooted in Western classical music, but many scores are also influenced by jazz, rock, pop, blues, new-age and ambient music, and a wide range of ethnic and world music styles. Since the 1950s, a growing number of scores have also included electronic elements as part of the score, and many scores written today feature a hybrid of orchestral and electronic instruments. Since the invention of digital technology and audio sampling, many modern films have been able to rely on digital samples to imitate the sound of live instruments, and many scores are created and performed wholly by the composers themselves, by using music composition software, synthesizers, samplers, and MIDI controllers. Songs such as pop songs and rock songs are usually not considered part of the film's score, although songs do also form part of the film's soundtrack. Although some songs, especially in musicals, are based on thematic ideas from the score (or vice versa), scores usually do not have lyrics, except for when sung by choirs or soloists as part of a cue. Similarly, pop songs which are \\"needle dropped\\" into a specific scene in film for added emphasis, or which are depicted as being part of the scenes' background (e.g., a song playing on a character's car radio), are not considered part of the score, although occasionally the score's composer will write an original pop song based on their themes, such as James Horner's \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" from Titanic, written for Celine Dion. Terminology A film score may also be called a background score, background music, film soundtrack, film music, screen composition, screen music, or incidental music. Process of creation =Spotting= The composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited, although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot, especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music. The composer is shown an unpolished \\"rough cut\\" of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone. The director and composer will watch the entire film, taking note of which scenes require original music. During this process, the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last, where it begins, where it ends, and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way. This process is known as \\"spotting\\". Occasionally, a filmmaker will actually edit his or her film to fit the flow of music, rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut. Director Godfrey Reggio edited his films Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi based on composer Philip Glass's music. Similarly, the relationship between director Sergio Leone and composer Ennio Morricone was such that the finale of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and the films Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America were edited to Morricone's score as the composer had prepared it months before the film's production ended. In another notable example, the finale of Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator John Williams: as recounted in a companion documentary on the DVD, Spielberg gave Williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture; Spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music. In some circumstances, a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene. This approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post- production process. Composer Hans Zimmer was asked to write music in this way in 2010 for director Christopher Nolan's film Inception; composer Gustavo Santaolalla did the same thing when he wrote his Oscar-winning score for Brokeback Mountain. =Syncing= When writing music for film, one goal is to sync dramatic events happening on screen with musical events in the score. There are many different methods for syncing music to picture. These include using sequencing software to calculate timings, using mathematic formulas and free timing with reference timings. Composers work using SMPTE timecode for syncing purposes. When syncing music to picture, generally a leeway of 3‚Äì4 frames late or early allows the composer to be extremely accurate. Using a technique called Free Timing, a conductor will use either (a) a stopwatch or studio size stop clock, or (b) watch the film on a screen or video monitor while conducting the musicians to predetermined timings. These are represented visually by vertical lines (streamers) and bursts of light called punches. These are put on the film by the Music Editor at points specified by the composer. In both instances, the timings on the clock or lines scribed on the film have corresponding timings which are also at specific points (beats) in the composer/conductor score. Written click track A written click track is a method of writing bars of music in consistent time values (i.e. 4 beats in :02‚Öî seconds) to establish a constant tempo in lieu of a metronome value (e.g. 88 Bpm). A composer would use a written click if they planned to conduct live performers. When using other methods such as a metronome, the conductor has a perfectly spaced click playing in his ear to which he conducts. This can yield stiff and lifeless performances in slower more expressive cues. One can convert a standard BPM value to a written click where X represents the number of beats per bar, and W represents time in seconds, by using the following equation: \\\\frac{60}{bpm}(x)=W Written clicks are expressed using 1/3 second increments, so the next step is to round the decimal to either 0, 1/3, or 2/3 of a second. The following is an example for 88 BPM: \\\\frac{60}{88}(4)=2.72 2.72 rounds to 2.66, so the written click is 4 beats in :02‚Öî seconds. Once the composer has identified the location in the film they wish to sync with musically, they must determine the musical beat this event occurs on. To find this, they use the following equation, where bpm is beats per minute, sp is the sync point in real-time (i.e. 33.7 seconds), and B is the beat number in 1/3 increments (i.e. 49‚Öî). \\\\frac{bpm(sp)}{60}+1=B =Writing= Once the spotting session has been completed and the precise timings of each cue determined, the composer will then work on writing the score. The methods of writing the score vary from composer to composer; some composers prefer to work with a traditional pencil and paper, writing notes by hand on a staff and performing works-in-progress for the director on a piano, while other composers write on computers using sophisticated music composition software such as Digital Performer, Logic Pro, Finale, Cubase, or Pro Tools.Kompanek, Sonny. From Score To Screen: Sequencers, Scores And Second Thoughts: The New Film Scoring Process. Schirmer Trade Books, 2004. Working with software allows composers to create MIDI-based demos of cues, called MIDI mockups, for review by the filmmaker prior to the final orchestral recording. The length of time a composer has to write the score varies from project to project; depending on the post-production schedule, a composer may have as little as two weeks or as much as three months to write the score. In normal circumstances, the actual writing process usually lasts around six weeks from beginning to end. The actual musical content of a film score is wholly dependent on the type of film being scored, and the emotions the director wishes the music to convey. A film score can encompass literally thousands of different combinations of instruments, ranging from full symphony orchestral ensembles to single solo instruments to rock bands to jazz combos, along with a multitude of ethnic and world music influences, soloists, vocalists, choirs and electronic textures. The style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project, and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set, the geographic location of the film's action, and even the musical tastes of the characters. As part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project; as such, it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles. =Orchestration= Once the music has been written, it must then be arranged or orchestrated in order for the ensemble to be able to perform it. The nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer, but in its basic form the orchestrator's job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and \\"flesh it out\\" into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform. Some composers, notably Ennio Morricone, orchestrate their own scores themselves, without using an additional orchestrator. Some composers provide intricate details in how they want this to be accomplished and will provide the orchestrator with copious notes outlining which instruments are being asked to perform which notes, giving the orchestrator no personal creative input whatsoever beyond re-notating the music on different sheets of paper as appropriate. Other composers are less detailed, and will often ask orchestrators to \\"fill in the blanks\\", providing their own creative input into the makeup of the ensemble, ensuring that each instrument is capable of performing the music as written, and even allowing them to introduce performance techniques and flourishes to enhance the score. In many cases, time constraints determined by the film's post-production schedule dictate whether composers orchestrate their own scores, as it is often impossible for the composer to complete all the required tasks within the time frame allowed. Over the years several orchestrators have become linked to the work of one particular composer, often to the point where one will not work without the other. Examples of enduring composer-orchestrator relationships include Jerry Goldsmith with Arthur Morton and Alexander Courage; John Williams with Herbert W. Spencer; Alan Menken with Danny Troob and Michael Starobin; Carter Burwell with Sonny Kompanek; Graeme Revell and Michael Giacchino with Tim Simonec; Alan Silvestri with James B. Campbell and William Ross; Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa with Eugene Zador; Alfred Newman with Edward Powell, Ken Darby and Hugo Friedhofer; Danny Elfman with Steve Bartek; Mark Isham with Ken Kulger; David Arnold with Nicholas Dodd; Randy Edelman with Ralph Ferraro and Stuart Balcomb; Basil Poledouris with Greig McRitchie; and Elliot Goldenthal with Robert Elhai. Others have become orchestrators-for-hire, and work with many different composers over the course of their careers; examples of prominent film music orchestrators include Pete Anthony, Jeff Atmajian, Brad Dechter, Bruce Fowler, John Neufeld, Thomas Pasatieri, Conrad Pope, Nic Raine and J.A.C. Redford. Once the orchestration process has been completed, the sheet music is physically printed onto paper by one or more music copyists and is ready for performance. =Recording= When the music has been composed and orchestrated, the orchestra or ensemble then performs it, often with the composer conducting. Musicians for these ensembles are often uncredited in the film or on the album and are contracted individually (and if so, the orchestra contractor is credited in the film or the soundtrack album). However, some films have recently begun crediting the contracted musicians on the albums under the name Hollywood Studio Symphony after an agreement with the American Federation of Musicians. Other performing ensembles that are often employed include the London Symphony Orchestra (performing film music since 1935)London Symphony Orchestra and Film Music LSO. Retrieved June 30, 2011 the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra (an orchestra dedicated mostly to recording), the BBC Philharmonic, and the Northwest Sinfonia. The orchestra performs in front of a large screen depicting the film, The conductor and musicians habitually wear headphones that sound a series of clicks called a \\"click- track\\" that changes with meter and tempo, assisting to synchronize the music with the film. More rarely, the director will talk to the composer before shooting has started, so as to give more time to the composer or because the director needs to shoot scenes (namely song or dance scenes) according to the final score. Sometimes the director will have edited the film using \\"temp (temporary) music\\": already published pieces with a character that the director believes to fit specific scenes. Elements of a film score Most films have between 45 and 120 minutes of music. However, some films have very little or no music; others may feature a score that plays almost continuously throughout. =Temp tracks= In some instances, film composers have been asked by the director to imitate a specific composer or style present in the temp track.George Burt, The art of film music, Northeastern University Press On other occasions, directors have become so attached to the temp score that they decide to use it and reject the original score written by the film composer. One of the most famous cases is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, where Kubrick opted for existing recordings of classical works, including pieces by composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti rather than the score by Alex North, although Kubrick had also hired Frank Cordell to do a score. Other examples include Torn Curtain (Bernard Herrmann), Troy (Gabriel Yared), Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Alan Silvestri), Peter Jackson's King Kong (Howard Shore), and The Bourne Identity (Carter Burwell). =Structure= Films often have different themes for important characters, events, ideas or objects, an idea often associated with Wagner's use of leitmotif. These may be played in different variations depending on the situation they represent, scattered amongst incidental music. The themes for specific characters or locations are known as a motif where the rest of the track is usually centred around the particular motif and the track develops in line with the motif. This common technique may often pass unnoticed by casual moviegoers, but has become well known among genre enthusiasts. One prominent example is John Williams' score for the Star Wars saga, and the numerous themes in Star Wars music associated with individual characters such as Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia. Similarly, the music of the Lord of the Rings film series featured recurring themes for many main characters and places. Another notable example is Jerry Goldsmith's Klingon theme from Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), which later composers in the Star Trek film series quoted in their Klingon motifs, and which was included on numerous occasions as a theme for Worf, the franchise's most prominent Klingon character. Michael Giacchino employed character themes in the soundtrack for the 2009 animated film Up, for which he received the Academy Award for Best Score. His orchestral soundtrack for the television series Lost also depended heavily on character and situation-specific themes. =Source music= \\"Source music\\" (or a \\"source cue\\") comes from an on screen source that can actually be seen or that can be inferred (in academic film theory such music is called \\"diegetic\\" music, as it emanates from the \\"diegesis\\" or \\"story world\\"). An example of \\"source music\\" is the use of the Frankie Valli song \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\" in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter. Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 thriller The Birds is an example of a Hollywood film with no non-diegetic music whatsoever. Dogme 95 is a filmmaking movement, started in Denmark in 1995, with a manifesto that prohibits any use of non-diegetic music in its films. Artistic merit =Music criticism= The artistic merits of film music are frequently debated. Some critics value it highly, pointing to music such as that written by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Aaron Copland, Bernard Herrmann, and others. Some consider film music to be a defining genre of classical music in the late 20th century, if only because it is the brand of classical music heard more often than any other. In some cases, film themes have become accepted into the canon of classical music. These are mostly works from already noted composers who have done scores; for instance, Sergei Prokofiev's score to Alexander Nevsky, or Vaughan Williams' score to Scott of the Antarctic. Others see the great bulk of film music as meritless. They consider that much film music is derivative, borrowing heavily from previous works. Composers of film scores typically can produce about three or four per year. The most popular works by composers such as John Williams and Danny Elfman are still far from entering the accepted canon. Even so, considering they are often the most popular modern compositions of classical music known to the general public, major orchestras sometimes perform concerts of such music, as do pops orchestras. =Preservation efforts= In 1983, a non-profit organization, the Society for the Preservation of Film Music, was formed to preserve the \\"byproducts\\" of creating a film score, including the music manuscripts (written music) and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which, in some instances, have been discarded by movie studios. The written music must be kept to perform the music on concert programs and to make new recordings of it. Sometimes only after decades has an archival recording of a film score been released on CD. History According to Kurt London, film music \\"began not as a result of any artistic urge, but from a dire need of something which would drown the noise made by the projector. For in those times there was as yet no sound-absorbent walls between the projection machine and the auditorium. This painful noise disturbed visual enjoyment to no small extent. Instinctively cinema proprietors had recourse to music, and it was the right way, using an agreeable sound to neutralize one less agreeable.\\"London. Film Music, p.28. Faber and Faber. Cited in Albright, Daniel, ed. (2004). Modernism and Music, p.96n40. . Before the age of recorded sound in motion pictures, efforts were taken to provide suitable music for films, usually through the services of an in-house pianist or organist, and, in some cases, entire orchestras, typically given cue sheets as a guide. A pianist was present to perform at the Lumiere brothers' first film screening in 1895.Film music: a history By James Eugene Wierzbicki, p.20 In 1914, The Oz Film Manufacturing Company sent full-length scores by Louis F. Gottschalk for their films. Other examples of this include Victor Herbert's score in 1915 to The Fall of a Nation (a sequel to The Birth of a Nation) and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' music for The Assassination of the Duke of Guise in 1908. It was preceded by Nathaniel D. Mann's score for The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays by four months, but that was a mixture of interrelated stage and film performance in the tradition of old magic lantern shows.Fairylogue was released September 24, 1908; Assassinat was released November 17, 1908 Most accompaniments at this time, these examples notwithstanding, comprised pieces by famous composers, also including studies. These were often used to form catalogues of photoplay music, which had different subsections broken down by 'mood' and genre: dark, sad, suspense, action, chase, etc. German cinema, which was highly influential in the era of silent movies, provided some original scores such as Fritz Lang's movies Die Nibelungen (1924) and Metropolis (1927) which were accompanied by original full scale orchestral and leitmotific scores written by Gottfried Huppertz, who also wrote piano-versions of his music, for playing in smaller cinemas. Friedrich W. Murnau's movies Nosferatu (1922 ‚Äì music by Hans Erdmann) and Faust ‚Äì Eine deutsche Volkssage (1926 ‚Äì music by Werner Richard Heymann) also had original scores written for them. Other films like Murnau's Der letzte Mann contained a mixing of original compositions (in this case by Giuseppe Becce) and library music / folk tunes, which were artistically included into the score by the composer. In France before the advent of talkies, Erik Satie composed what many consider the first \\"frame by frame\\" synchronous film score for director Ren√© Clair's avant-garde short Entr'acte (1924).Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 199.\\"Erik Satie\\", Royal Opera House (UK) website, at http://www.roh.org.uk/people/erik-satie. Anticipating \\"spotting\\" techniques and the inconsistencies of projection speeds in screenings of silent films, Satie took precise timings for each sequence and created a flexible, aleatoric score of brief, evocative motifs which could be repeated and varied in tempo as required.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 244. American composers Virgil Thomson and Aaron Copland cited Satie's music for Entr'acte as a major influence on their own forays into film scoring.Justin Wintle (ed.), \\"New Makers of Modern Culture\\", Routledge, 2016, p. 1342. When sound came to movies, director Fritz Lang barely used music in his movies anymore. Apart from Peter Lorre whistling a short piece from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt, Lang's movie M ‚Äì Eine Stadt sucht einen M√∂rder was lacking musical accompaniment completely and Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse only included one original piece written for the movie by Hans Erdmann played at the very beginning and end of the movie. One of the rare occasions on which music occurs in the movie is a song one of the characters sings, that Lang uses to put emphasis on the man's insanity, similar to the use of the whistling in M. A landmark event in music synchronization with the action in film was achieved in the score composed by Max Steiner for David O. Selznick's 1933 King Kong. A fine example of this is when the aborigine chief slowly approaches the unwanted visitors to Skull Island who are filming the natives' sacred rites. As he strides closer and closer, each footfall is reinforced by a background chord. Though \\"the scoring of narrative features during the 1940s lagged decades behind technical innovations in the field of concert music,\\" the 1950s saw the rise of the modernist film score. Director Elia Kazan was open to the idea of jazz influences and dissonant scoring and worked with Alex North, whose score for A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) combined dissonance with elements of blues and jazz. Kazan also approached Leonard Bernstein to score On the Waterfront (1954) and the result was reminiscent of earlier works by Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky with its \\"jazz-based harmonies and exciting additive rhythms.\\" A year later, Leonard Rosenman, inspired by Arnold Schoenberg, experimented with atonality in his scores for East of Eden (1955) and Rebel Without a Cause (1955). In his ten-year collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock, Bernard Herrmann experimented with ideas in Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960). The use of non-diegetic jazz was another modernist innovation, such as jazz star Duke Ellington's score for Otto Preminger's Anatomy of a Murder (1959).

J. Abrams and Brad Bird, James Horner with James Cameron and Ron Howard, Akira Ifukube with Ishir≈ç Honda, A. R. Rahman with Mani Ratnam and Joseph Trapanese with Joseph Kosinski. Production music Many companies provide music to various film, TV and commercial projects for a fee. Sometimes called library music, the music is owned by production music libraries and licensed to customers for use in film, television, radio and other media. Examples of firms include Jingle Punks, Associated Production Music, FirstCom Music, VideoHelper and Extreme Music. Unlike popular and classical music publishers, who typically own less than 50 percent of the copyright in a composition, music production libraries own all of the copyrights of their music, meaning that it can be licensed without seeking the composer's permission, as is necessary in licensing music from normal publishers. This is because virtually all music created for music libraries is done on a work for hire basis. Production music is therefore a very convenient medium for media producers ‚Äì they can be assured that they will be able to license any piece of music in the library at a reasonable rate. Production music libraries will typically offer a broad range of musical styles and genres, enabling producers and editors to find much of what they need in the same library. Music libraries vary in size from a few hundred tracks up to many thousands. The first production music library was set up by De Wolfe Music in 1927 with the advent of sound in film, the company originally scored music for use in silent film. Another music library was set up by Ralph Hawkes of Boosey & Hawkes Music Publishers in the 1930s. APM, the largest US library, has over 250,000 tracks.

Its derivation is uncertain; it could come from \\"blac\\", a nickname for someone who had dark hair or skin, or from \\"blaac\\", a nickname for someone with pale hair or skin. Another theory, presumably in the belief it is a Welsh patronymic in origin, for which there is no evidence whatsoever, was that it is a corruption of \\"Ap Lake\\", meaning \\"Son of Lake\\". Blake was the name of one of the 14 Tribes of Galway in Ireland. These Blakes were descendants of Richard Caddell, alias Blake, who was involved in the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. As such a long present foreign name it became known as de Bl√°ca in Irish. The origins of the name Blake are also considered to be Old Norse, first appearing in Yorkshire, England, possibly derived from the word Blaker, referring to a village and a former municipality of Akershus county, Norway (east of Oslo). The Blake surname is first recorded in the latter half of the 12th century, making it one of the earliest on record. Later interesting examples of the name in records taken from the Dictionary of National Biography include the famous Admiral Robert Blake, 1599‚Äì1657, who destroyed the Spanish Fleet at Santa Cruz, and died on the way home, and Francis Blake, who earlier in 1635 had embarked from London on the ship George bound for Virginia. He is believed to have been the first of the many Blakes to colonize New England. The first recorded spelling of the family name is believed to be that of Walter le Blake. This was dated 1167, in the \\"Pipe Rolls\\" of the county of Devonshire, and during the reign of King Henry II, known as \\"The Builder of Churches\\", 1154‚Äì1189. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation, and in most cases, but not necessarily this one, surnames in every country have continued to \\"develop\\", often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling. Blake often refers to the British poet, painter and printmaker William Blake (1757‚Äì1827) or to the contemporary figurative artist Blake.

It is a Bildungsroman and a picaresque novel. It was first published on 28 February 1749 in London and is among the earliest English works to be classified as a novel. It is the earliest novel mentioned by W. Somerset Maugham in his 1948 book Great Novelists and Their Novels among the ten best novels of the world.http://home.comcast.net/~dwtaylor1/maughamstenbestnovels.html The novel is highly organised despite its length. Samuel Taylor Coleridge argued that it has one of the \\"three most perfect plots ever planned\\", alongside Oedipus Tyrannus and The Alchemist.Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Henry Nelson Coleridge, Specimens of the table talk of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (London, England: John Murray, 1835), volume 2, page 339. It became a best seller with four editions published in its first year alone. It is generally regarded as Fielding's greatest book and as an influential English novel.Drabble, Margaret, ed. (1998) The Oxford Companion to English Literature; (2nd) revised ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press; pp. 982‚Äì983 Plot The novel's events occupy eighteen books. The book opens with the narrator stating that the purpose of the novel will be to explore \\"human nature\\". The kindly and wealthy Squire Allworthy and his sister Bridget are introduced in their wealthy estate in Somerset. Allworthy returns from London after an extended business trip and finds an abandoned baby sleeping in his bed. He summons his housekeeper, Mrs Deborah Wilkins, to take care of the child. After searching the nearby village Mrs Wilkins is told about a young woman called Jenny Jones, a servant of a schoolmaster and his wife, as the most likely person to have committed the deed. Jenny is brought before the Allworthys and admits being the baby's mother, but she refuses to reveal the father's identity. Mr Allworthy mercifully removes Jenny to a place where her reputation will be unknown and tells his sister to raise the boy, whom he names Thomas, in his household. Two brothers, Dr Blifil and Captain Blifil, regularly visit the Allworthy estate. The doctor introduces the captain to Bridget in the hope of marrying into Allworthy's wealth. The couple soon marries. After the marriage, Captain Blifil begins to show a coldness to his brother, who eventually feels obliged to leave the house for London. He does, and, soon after, he dies \\"of a broken heart\\". Captain Blifil and his wife start to grow cool towards one another, and the former is found dead from apoplexy one evening after taking his customary evening stroll before dinner. By then, he has fathered a boy who grows up with the bastard Tom. Captain Blifil's son, known as Master Blifil, is a miserable and jealous boy who conspires against Tom. Tom grows into a vigorous and lusty yet honest and kind-hearted youth. He tends to be closer friends with the servants and gamekeepers than with members of the gentry. He is close friends with Black George, who is the gamekeeper. His first love is Molly, Black George's second daughter and a local beauty. She throws herself at Tom, who gets her pregnant and then feels obliged to offer her his protection. After some time, however, Tom finds out that Molly is somewhat promiscuous. He then falls in love with a neighbouring squire's lovely daughter, Sophia Western. Tom and Sophia confess their love for each other after Tom breaks his arm rescuing Sophia. Tom's status as a bastard causes Sophia's father and Allworthy to disapprove their love. This class friction gives Fielding an opportunity for biting social commentary. The inclusion of prostitution and sexual promiscuity in the plot was also novel for its time, and it was the foundation for criticism of the book's \\"lowness\\".. Squire Allworthy falls ill and is convinced that he is dying. His family and servants gather around his bed as he disposes his wealth. He gives a favourable amount of his wealth to Tom Jones, which displeases Master Blifil. Tom doesn't care about what he has been given, since his only concern is Allworthy's health. Allworthy's health improves, and we learn that he will live. Tom Jones is so excited that he begins to get drunk and gets into a fight with Master Blifil. Sophia wants to conceal her love for Tom, so she gives a majority of her attention to Blifil when the three of them are together. This leads to Sophia's aunt, Mrs Western, believing that Sophia and Blifil are in love. Squire Western wants Sophia to marry Blifil in order to gain property from the Allworthy estate. Blifil learns of Sophia's true affection for Tom Jones and is angry. Blifil tells Allworthy that, on the day he almost died, Tom was out drinking and singing and celebrating his coming death. This leads Tom to be banished. Tom is expelled from Allworthy's estate and begins his adventures across Britain, eventually ending up in London. On the way, he meets a barber, Partridge, who was banished from town because he was thought to be Tom's father. He becomes Tom's faithful companion in the hope of restoring his reputation. During their journey, they end up at an inn. While they are there, a lady and her maid arrive. An angry man arrives, and the chambermaid points him in the direction she thinks he needs to go. He bursts in on Tom and Mrs Waters, a woman whom Tom rescued, in bed together. The man, however, was looking for Mrs Fitzpatrick and leaves. Sophia and her maid arrive at the same inn, and Partridge unknowingly reveals the relationship between Tom and Mrs Waters. Sophia leaves with Mrs Fitzpatrick, who is her cousin, and heads for London. They arrive at the home of Lady Bellaston, followed by Tom and Partridge. Eventually, Tom tells Sophia that his true love is for her and no one else. Tom ends up getting into a duel with Mr Fitzpatrick, which leads to his imprisonment. Eventually, the secret of Tom's birth is revealed after a brief scare involving Mrs Waters. Mrs Waters is really Jenny Jones, Tom's supposed mother, and Tom fears that he has committed incest. This, however, is not the case, as Tom's mother is in fact Bridget Allworthy, who conceived him after an affair with a schoolmaster. Tom is thus Squire Allworthy's nephew. After finding out about the intrigues of Blifil, who is Tom's half-brother, Allworthy decides to bestow most of his inheritance on Tom. After Tom's true parentage is revealed, he and Sophia marry, as Squire Western no longer harbours any misgivings about Tom marrying his daughter. Sophia bears Tom a son and a daughter, and the couple live on happily with the blessings of Squire Western and Squire Allworthy. Style The highly visible narrator is a central feature of Tom Jones. Each book begins with a prefatory chapter directly addressing the reader, and the narrator provides a continuous commentary on characters and events. According to Wayne C. Booth, the reader's relationship with the narrator is something like a subplot. The reader becomes more attached to the narrator over the course of the book, culminating in a heartfelt farewell. The fight at the inn at Upton Fielding presents a panorama of contemporary British life, drawing characters from many different classes and occupations. But Ian Watt argues in The Rise of the Novel that Fielding did not aim at the \\"realism of presentation\\" of lifelike detail and psychology practiced by authors such as Richardson. Watt claims that Fielding was more focused on the \\"realism of assessment\\", the way in which the novel engages a broad range of topics with intelligence and \\"a wise assessment of life\\". Themes The main theme of the novel is the contrast between Tom Jones's good nature, flawed but eventually corrected by his love for virtuous Sophia Western, and his half-brother Blifil's hypocrisy. Secondary themes include several other examples of virtue (especially that of Squire Allworthy), hypocrisy (especially that of Thwackum) and villainy (for example, that of Mrs Western and Ensign Northerton), sometimes tempered by repentance (for instance Square and Mrs Waters n√©e Jones). Both introductory chapters to each book and interspersed commentary introduce a long line of further themes. For instance, introductory chapters dwell extensively on bad writers and critics, quite unrelated to the plot but apologetic to the author and the novel itself; and authorial commentary on several characters shows strong opposition to Methodism, calling it fanatical and heretical, and implying an association between Methodism and hypocrites such as the younger Blifil. The novel takes place against the backdrop of the Jacobite rising of 1745. Characters take different sides over the rebellion, which was an attempt to restore Roman Catholicism as the established religion of England and to undo the Glorious Revolution. At one point Sophia Western is even mistaken for Jenny Cameron, the supposed lover of Bonnie Prince Charlie. Good-natured characters are often moderately loyalist and Anglican, or even supporters of the House of Hanover, while ill-natured characters (Mrs Western) or mistaken ones (Partridge) can be Jacobites, or (like Squire Western) anti-Hanoverian.

It inspired the 1976 film The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones. It has also been the basis of operas by Fran√ßois-Andr√© Philidor in 1765 as Philidor's opera, by Edward German in 1907 as German's opera, and by Stephen Oliver in 1975. A BBC adaptation dramatised by Simon Burke was broadcast in 1997 with Max Beesley in the title role. The book has also been adapted for the stage by Joan Macalpine. In 2014, Jon Jory adapted the novel for the stage. The book will also be adapted into a jukebox musical called What's New Pussycat? featuring songs by the singer Tom Jones setting the story in the 1960s.

According to the Book of Mormon, \\"deseret\\" meant \\"honeybee\\" in the language of the Jaredites, a group believed by Mormons to have been led to the Americas following the construction of the Tower of Babel (see ). LDS scholar Hugh Nibley (extending the work of Egyptologist Sir Alan Gardiner) suggested an etymology by associating the word \\"Deseret\\" with the ancient Egyptian dsrt (Egyptian: ìÇßìàôìÇãìèèìãî), a term referring to the \\"bee crown\\" of the Lower Kingdom. State of Deseret The provisional 1849 boundaries of the State of Deseret, named after the word for honeybees in the Book of Mormon. The proposed boundary of Deseret is the dotted line, while the Utah Territory is blue and outlined in black; boundaries are not exact. Deseret was proposed as a name for the U.S. state of Utah. Brigham Young‚Äîgovernor of Utah Territory from 1850 to 1858 and president of the LDS Church from 1847 to 1877‚Äîfavored the name as a symbol of industry. Young taught his followers that they should be productive and self-sufficient, a trait he had perceived in honeybees. The Mormons petitioned for statehood as the State of Deseret in 1849‚Äì50, but the petition was rejected by the U.S. Congress because of the vast size of the relatively unpopulated area that was controlled exclusively by the LDS Church. Instead, the federal government created Utah Territory, the name of which was derived from the resident Ute Indians meaning \\"People of the Mountains\\" according to some sources, though local Ute tribe members such as \\"Larry Cesspooch, public relations director for the audio/visual department of the Ute Tribe in Fort Duchesne,\\" who states that \\"the Utes don't even have such a word in their language. He said Utah - Anglicized from \\"Yuta\\" - is what the Spanish called the Utes, and his research indicates it meant 'meat eaters.' Cesspooch has used this explanation in various public presentations, and he said he's never been challenged on it.\\" In 1896, Utah Territory gained statehood as Utah. Some vestiges of the name survive. For example, the state symbol of Utah is a beehive; this emblem is represented on both the state seal, state flag, and marker shields for state highways. The state nickname is the \\"Beehive State\\" and the honeybee is Utah's official state insect. The Salt Lake Bees are a minor league baseball team representing Utah in the Pacific Coast League. Named after the original Salt Lake Bees (PCL, 1915‚Äì26), they were formerly known as the Buzz (1994‚Äì2000) and the Stingers (2001‚Äì05). \\"Deseret\\" appears twice on the Utah stone located on the 220-foot landing of the Washington Monument. Other uses Various businesses and organizations use \\"Deseret\\" as part of their name, particularly those that have connections to the LDS Church.

Opened in 1921, it is the oldest controlled-access highway in Europe. Until 1998, it was also used as a motor racing circuit. Today, the AVUS forms the northern part of the Bundesautobahn 115. Circuit The highway is located in the southwestern districts of Berlin, linking the Stadtring at the Funkturm junction in Charlottenburg with Nikolassee. It runs through the Grunewald forest along the historic K√∂nigsweg road from Charlottenburg to Potsdam and the parallel Berlin-Blankenheim railway line. ADAC Reichsfahrt, 1922 While normal for a road, it is unusually shaped for a race track as it is essentially two long straights in the form of a dual carriageway, with a hairpin corner at each end. The north curve featured a steep banking from 1937 to 1967. While the original layout was long, the southern turn was moved several times, to shorten the track to , then without the banking, and finally . History Comparison of AVUS track banking to two other tracksIn 1907 the Kaiserlicher Automobilclub (KAC) association devised a fee-financed circuit, as both a motor-sport venue and a testing track for the motor industry. A developing company was established in 1909; however, a lack of finances and official authorisations delayed the start of construction until spring 1913. During the Great War works discontinued, and though Russian Army prisoners were temporarily employed in AVUS's construction, the track was still unfinished. From 1920 the remaining road work was financed by business man and politician Hugo Stinnes. The circuit including a gate building and several stands was inaugurated in the course of the first post-war International Automobile Exhibition (IAA) with a motor race on 24 September 1921. Afterwards the road was open to the public at a charge of ten Marks. =Race track= Caracciola (left) after winning the 1926 German Grand Prix At the time of opening, AVUS was km (12 miles) long ‚Äì each straight being approximately half that length, and joined at each end by flat, large-radius curves, driven counter-clockwise. While the Grand Prix motor racing scene still evaded German tracks, the circuit from 1922 was also the site of motorcycle races. On 11 July 1926 the track played host to the first international German Grand Prix for sports cars, organised by the Automobilclub von Deutschland, the former KAC. The 1921 roadway turned out to be insufficient: already in the training two days before the young Italian driver Enrico Plat√© (not to be confused with the Argentinian driver and team owner of the same name) had been in a car crash, whereby his mechanic was killed. During the race in heavy rain two track marshals died when Adolf Rosenberger lost control and hit the indicator board and the timekeeper's box, a third employee succumbed to his injuries in hospital a few hours later. The Grand Prix was won by his fellow team-member, the so-far unknown Mercedes-Benz salesman Rudolf Caracciola from Dresden, driving a private eight-cylinder \\"Monza\\" Kompressor type. The fastest lap of 161 km/h (100 mph) was set by Ferdinando Minoia in an OM. AVUS race, 1931 From 1927 the German Grand Prix was relocated to the new and more secure N√ºrburgring circuit in the Western German Eifel range, while the AVUS received a new asphalt surface and served as an experimental track for rocket cars. On 23 May 1928 Fritz von Opel (\\"Rocket Fritz\\") achieved a speed record of in an Opel RAK2. Due to the Great Depression annual auto races were not resumed until 1931, when Caracciola again won in a Mercedes-Benz SSK, succeeded by Manfred von Brauchitsch in the next year, after Caracciola had switched to Alfa Romeo. Start of the 1932 race, with Manfred von Brauchitsch in front The competition on 22 May 1932 saw further notable participants like the Earl Howe, Hans Stuck and Sir Malcolm Campbell. The Czechoslovak driver Prince George Christian of Lobkowicz died when his Bugatti Type 54 crashed in the southern hairpin. The following events were won by Achille Varzi (1933) and Guy Moll (1934), to the great annoyance of the new Nazi rulers, who declared the victory of German drivers and cars a matter of national pride. They strongly backed the construction of the new Silver Arrows (Silberpfeile) generation of Mercedes- Benz and Auto Union. Streamlined Mercedes-Benz W25 Silver Arrow on the banking, 1937 In 1935 Luigi Fagioli won the race in a Mercedes-Benz W25; however, the track was no longer adequate for cars reaching average race speeds of far over . In an effort to make AVUS the \\"world's fastest race track\\", the 1936 season was skipped and while the track hosted the cycling road race, the marathon and 50 km walk athletic events of the 1936 Summer Olympics, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn (43¬∞) made of bricks.1937 GRAND PRIX SEASON - PART 2 It became dubbed the \\"Wall of Death,\\" especially as it had no retaining barrier so cars that missed the turn easily flew off it.Tracks-Germany The Silver Arrows raced only once on the banked version, in 1937. As the AVUS race did not count towards the championship, non-GP cars were allowed, which permitted the use of streamlined cars, similar to the cars used for high speed record attempts. This race was run in 2 heats; during qualifying for the second heat, Luigi Fagioli stuck his Auto Union Type C on pole position, with a time of 4 minutes and 8.2 seconds at an average speed of 284.31 km/h (176.7 mph)- which was the fastest motor racing lap in history until this time was bettered by Tony Bettenhausen in qualifying for the 1957 Race of Two Worlds at Monza. It was also bettered by 4 drivers during the 1971 Indianapolis 500. Mercedes driver Hermann Lang's average race speed of about was the fastest road race in history for nearly five decades, and was not matched on a high speed banked-circuit until the mid-1980s at the 1986 Indianapolis 500.\\"1986 Indianapolis 500\\". racing-reference.info. Racing Reference. No major race was held after 1937, as in early 1938 the popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer was killed in a land speed record attempt on a straight section of the Autobahn Frankfurt‚ÄìDarmstadt (present-day Bundesautobahn 5), at which point the high-speed AVUS was considered too dangerous for the fast Grand Prix race cars. Furthermore, it was to be connected to the growing Reichsautobahn network in 1940 by extending it south towards the Berliner Ring, therefore the original hairpin at Nikolassee was demolished and replaced by a junction. A planned banked south turn was never built; the cleared grounds in the Grunewald forest were used as a proving ground (\\"Keerans Range\\") by the American occupation forces after World War II. =Post-war= The first AVUS race after the war was held on 1 July 1951 for Formula Two and Formula Three cars, won by East German driver Paul Greifzu. For post-war racing, the original extremely long straights were shortened by the introduction of a new south turn roughly in the middle (just before the H√ºttenweg exit, where it can still be seen), reducing the track length to 8.3 km (just over 5 miles). After World War II, the Berlin Wall with its Checkpoint Bravo at Dreilinden/Drewitz came no closer than about one mile (1.6 km) to the former South Turn. It is a common yet incorrect belief that the Berlin Wall cut the AVUS in half. 1955 race, two cars on the north banking It was not until 19 September 1954 that this shorter track hosted a non- championship Formula One race. This \\"Grand Prix of Berlin\\" was mainly a show dominated by the Mercedes-Benz W196 drivers Karl Kling (the winner) and Juan Manuel Fangio. No serious competition was present, as many teams had refused to show up and the German Grand Prix was still held on the N√ºrburgring. Finally AVUS hosted its only world championship Formula One race with the 1959 German Grand Prix on 2 August, won by Tony Brooks. This race weekend also saw the death of French driver Jean Behra in a supporting sports car race, as his Porsche RSK flew over the top of the north turn banking, as there was no wall or fence. German driver and journalist Richard von Frankenberg had previously walked away from a similar spectacular crash at the same site, but Behra would have no such luck as his body impacted a flagpole head-first after he was flung from his car. After 1961, Grand Prix racing did not race on banked circuits anymore. The banked sections at Autodromo Nazionale Monza and Autodrome de Linas-Montlh√©ry were considered dangerous by international racing standards. They were used in connection with chicanes for some time, then abandoned. The AVUS banking was dismantled in 1967 to give way to an expanded intersection under the Funkturm tower. From the top of this tower, one can see that the AVUS is not perfectly straight. The old banked circuit can be seen in the film A Dandy in Aspic (1968) featuring period racing cars. Racing was continued with a flat north turn, but AVUS only held national touring cars DTM and Formula 3 events. The length of the track was roughly cut in half twice in the 1980s and 1990 as racing on straights became unpopular. Also, chicanes were added to reduce entry speed into the North Curve. Yet, some incidents and accidents occurred. The BMW of Dieter Quester rolled over when exiting the last corner, and crossed the finish line sliding on its roof, with sparks flying, for a podium finish. The car of John Winter hit a barrier and exploded into a fireball in North Curve, which he survived. In 1995, the race 2 of DTM had to be cancelled, after a multi-car pileup blocked the circuit; later that September, British driver Kieth O'dor was killed in a Super Touring Car event when his car spun and was rammed sideways.Search Results =AVUS today= North end, view from Funkturm Motel with former control tower After the fall of the Berlin wall, the closure of the AVUS for race events became increasingly problematic over traffic and associated environmental concerns. After the last races in 1998, a farewell event with veterans was held in 1999. Since 2000, the new EuroSpeedway Lausitz in Brandenburg is considered the replacement venue for competition. The round race control tower at the north end still remains with its prominent Mercedes-Benz and Bosch sponsorship insignia. It is used as a (now closed) public restaurant and motel.

The story was first published in the Argentinian journal Sur, May 1940. The \\"postscript\\" dated 1947 is intended to be anachronistic, set seven years in the future. The first English-language translation of the story was published in 1961. Told in a first-person narrative, the story focuses on the author's discovery of the mysterious and apparently fictional world of Tl√∂n, whose inhabitants believe a form of subjective idealism, denying the reality of objects, and speak in a language lacking nouns. Relatively long for Borges (approximately 5,600 words), the story is a work of speculative fiction. The story alludes to many leading intellectual figures both in Argentina and in the world at large, and takes up a number of themes more typical of a novel of ideas. Most of the ideas engaged are in the areas of metaphysics, language, epistemology, and literary criticism. Summary The story unfolds as a first-person narrative and contains many references (see below) to real people, places, literary works and philosophical concepts, besides some fictional or ambiguous ones. It is divided into two parts and a postscript. Events and facts are revealed roughly in the order that the narrator becomes aware of them or their relevance. The timing of events in Borges's story is approximately from 1935 to 1947; the plot concerns events going back as far as the early 17th century and culminating in the postscript, set in 1947. =Part one= Borges and his friend and collaborator, Adolfo Bioy Casares, are developing their next book in a country house near Buenos Aires, in 1940. In an observation, Bioy quotes that \\"mirrors and copulation are abominable because they increase the number of men\\" from a heresiarch of a land named Uqbar. Borges, impressed with the \\"memorable\\" sentence, asks for its source. Bioy replies that he had read it in the chapter about Uqbar of the Anglo-American Cyclopaedia, \\"a literal if inadequate reprint\\" of the 1902 edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. They check the book and are unable to find the said chapter, to Bioy's surprise.\\"Tl√∂n...\\", p. 112 The two then search for the name 'Uqbar' in numerous atlases and other encyclopedias, trying different alternative name forms, to no avail. The following day, Bioy tells Borges he has found the chapter they were looking for in a different reprint of the same encyclopedia. The chapter, although brief and full of names unfamiliar to Borges and Bioy, entices their curiosity. It describes Uqbar as an obscure region, located in Iraq or Asia Minor, with an all-fantastic literature taking place in the mythical worlds of Mlejnas and Tl√∂n.\\"Tl√∂n...\\", p. 113 Afterwards, they keep searching for Uqbar in other sources, but are unable to find any mention. =Part two= The engineer Herbert Ashe, an English friend of Borges' father with a peculiar interest in duodecimal, dies of an aneurysm rupture. Borges inherits a packet containing a book, which was left by Ashe in a pub. That book is revealed to be the eleventh volume of an English-language encyclopedia entirely devoted to Tl√∂n, one of the worlds in which Uqbar's legends are set. The book contains two oval blue stamps with the words Orbis Tertius inscribed in blue. From that point, as Borges reads the tome, part two comprehensively describes and discusses Tl√∂n's culture, history, languages and philosophy. The people of the imaginary Tl√∂n hold an extreme form of Berkeley's subjective idealism, denying the reality of the world. Their world is understood \\"not as a concurrence of objects in space, but as a heterogeneous series of independent acts.\\"\\"Tl√∂n‚Ä¶\\", p. 115 One of the imagined language families of Tl√∂n lacks nouns, being centered instead in impersonal verbs qualified by monosyllabic adverbial affixes. Borges lists a Tl√∂nic equivalent of \\"The moon rose above the water\\": hl√∂r u fang axaxaxas ml√∂, meaning literally \\"upward behind the onstreaming it mooned\\". (Andrew Hurley, one of Borges' translators, wrote a fiction in which he says that the words \\"axaxaxas ml√∂\\" \\"can only be pronounced as the author's cruel, mocking laughter\\".Andrew Hurley, The Zahir and I, The Garden of Forking Paths, part of TheModernWorld.com. Accessed 3 August 2006.) In another language family of Tl√∂n, \\"the basic unit is not the verb, but the monosyllabic adjective\\", which in combinations of two or more forms nouns: \\"moon\\" becomes \\"round airy-light on dark\\" or \\"pale-orange-of-the- sky\\". In a world where there are no nouns‚Äîor where nouns are composites of other parts of speech, created and discarded according to a whim‚Äîand no things, most of Western philosophy becomes impossible. Without nouns about which to state propositions, there can be no a priori deductive reasoning from first principles. Without history, there can be no teleology (showing a divine purpose playing itself out in the world). If there can be no such thing as observing the same object at different times, there is no possibility of a posteriori inductive reasoning (generalizing from experience). Ontology‚Äîthe philosophy of what it means to be‚Äîis an alien concept. Tl√∂n is a world of Berkeleyan idealism with one critical omission: it lacks the omnipresent, perceiving deity on whom Berkeley relied as a point of view demanding an internally consistent world. This infinitely mutable world is tempting to a playful intellect, and its \\"transparent tigers and ... towers of blood\\" appeal to baser minds, but a Tl√∂nic world view requires denying most of what would normally be considered common sense reality. =Postscript= In the anachronistic postscript set in 1947, Borges remembers events that occurred in the last years. In 1941, the world and the narrator have learned, through the emergence of a letter, about the true nature of Tl√∂n. It goes that a \\"benevolent secret society\\" was formed \\"one night in Lucerne or in London\\", in the 17th century, and had Berkeley among its members. That group, a society of intellectuals named Orbis Tertius, studied \\"hermetic studies, philanthropy and the cabala\\" (an allusion to societies such as the Bavarian Illuminati, the Freemasons and the Rosicrucians), but its main purpose was to create a country: Uqbar. It gradually became clear that such work would have to be carried by numerous generations, so each master agreed to elect a disciple who would carry on his work to perpetuate an hereditary arrangement. The society is eventually persecuted, but reemerges in the United States in the following century. The American \\"eccentric\\" millionaire Ezra Buckley, one of the members of the restored sect, finds its undertaking too modest, proposing that their creation be of an entire world instead of just a country. He also adds that an entire encyclopedia about this world‚Äînamed Tl√∂n‚Äîmust be written and that the whole scheme \\"have no truck with that impostor Jesus Christ\\" (and therefore none with Berkeley's God).\\"Tl√∂n‚Ä¶\\", p. 120 The new Orbis Tertius, composed of three hundred collaborators, proceeds to conclude the final volume of the First Encyclopedia of Tl√∂n. An explanation of Uqbar is not explicitly given in the story. By 1942, Tl√∂nian objects began to inexplicably appear in the real world. One of the first instances in which this occurs is when Princess Faucigny Lucinge received, via mail, a vibrating compass with a Tl√∂nian scripture. Another instance is witnessed by Borges himself: a drunk man, shortly after dying, dropped coins among which a small but extremely heavy shining metal cone appeared. It is suggested that these occurrences may have been forgeries, but yet products of a secret science and technology. By 1944, all forty volumes of the First Encyclopedia of Tl√∂n have been discovered and published in a library in Memphis. The material becomes accessible worldwide and immensely influential on Earth's culture, science and languages. By the time Borges concludes the story, presumably in 1947, the world is gradually becoming Tl√∂n. Borges then turns to an obsession of his own: a translation of Sir Thomas Browne's Urn Burial into Spanish. Major themes =Philosophical themes= Through the vehicle of fantasy or speculative fiction, this story playfully explores several philosophical questions and themes. These include, above all, an effort by Borges to imagine a world (Tl√∂n) where the 18th century philosophical subjective idealism of George Berkeley is viewed as common sense In the interview, Dutton refers to Tl√∂n as \\"A world in which Berkeley is common sense instead of Descartes\\". Borges concurs. and \\"the doctrine of materialism\\" is considered a heresy, a scandal, and a paradox.\\"Tl√∂n...\\", p.117 Through describing the languages of Tl√∂n, the story also plays with the Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis‚Äîthe epistemological question of how language influences what thoughts are possible. The story also contains several metaphors for the way ideas influence reality. This last theme is first explored cleverly, by way of describing physical objects being willed into existence by the force of imagination, but later turns darker, as fascination with the idea of Tl√∂n begins to distract people from paying adequate attention to the reality of Earth. Much of the story engages with the philosophical idealism of George Berkeley, who questioned whether it is possible to say that a thing exists if it is not being perceived. (Berkeley, a philosopher and, later, a bishop in the Protestant Church of Ireland, resolved that question to his own satisfaction by saying that the omnipresent perception of God ensures that objects continue to exist outside of personal or human perception.) Berkeley's philosophy privileges perceptions over any notion of the \\"thing in itself.\\" Immanuel Kant accused Berkeley of going so far as to deny objective reality. In the imagined world of Tl√∂n, an exaggerated Berkeleyan idealism without God passes for common sense. The Tl√∂nian recognizes perceptions as primary and denies the existence of any underlying reality. At the end of the main portion of the story, immediately before the postscript, Borges stretches this toward its logical breaking point by imagining that, \\"Occasionally a few birds, a horse perhaps, have saved the ruins of an amphitheater\\" by continuing to perceive it.\\"Tl√∂n‚Ä¶\\", p.119 Besides commenting on Berkeley's philosophy, this and other aspects of Borges's story can be taken as a commentary on the ability of ideas to influence reality. For example, in Tl√∂n there are objects known as hr√∂nir that arise when two different people find the \\"same\\" lost object in different places. Borges imagines a Tl√∂nite working his way out of the problem of solipsism by reasoning that if all people are actually aspects of one being, then perhaps the universe is consistent because that one being is consistent in his imagining. This is, effectively, a near-reconstruction of the Berkeleyan God: perhaps not omnipresent, but bringing together all perceptions that do, indeed, occur. This story is not the only place where Borges engages with Berkeleyan idealism. In the world of Tl√∂n, as in Borges's essay New refutation of time (1947), there is (as Emir Rodr√≠guez Monegal and Alastair Reid comment) a \\"denial of space, time, and the individual I.\\"Monegal and Reed, notes to Borges, a Reader, p. 353. This worldview does not merely \\"bracket off\\" objective reality, but also parcels it separately into all its successive moments. Even the continuity of the individual self is open to question. When Borges writes \\"The metaphysicians of Tl√∂n are not looking for truth or even an approximation to it: they are after a kind of amazement. They consider metaphysics a branch of fantastic literature,\\"\\"Tl√∂n‚Ä¶\\", p.116 he can be seen either as anticipating the extreme relativism that underlies some postmodernism or simply as taking a swipe at those who take metaphysics too seriously. =Literary themes= In the context of the imagined world of Tl√∂n, Borges describes a school of literary criticism that arbitrarily assumes that two works are by the same person and, based on that, deduces things about the imagined author. This is similar to the ending of \\"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\\", in which Borges's narrator suggests that a new perspective can be opened by treating a book as though it were written by a different author. The story also plays with the theme of the love of books in general, and of encyclopedias and atlases in particular‚Äîbooks that are each themselves, in some sense, a world. Like many of Borges's works, the story challenges the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction. It mentions several quite real historical human beings (himself, his friend Bioy Casares, Thomas de Quincey, et al.) but often attributes fictional aspects to them; the story also contains many fictional characters and others whose factuality may be open to question. =Other themes= \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" also engages a number of other related themes. The story begins and ends with issues of reflection, replication, and reproduction‚Äîboth perfect and imperfect‚Äîand the related issue of the power of language and ideas to make or remake the world. At the start of the story, we have an \\"unnerving\\" and \\"grotesque\\" mirror reflecting the room, a \\"literal if inadequate\\" (and presumably plagiarized) reproduction of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, an apt misquotation by Bioy Casares, and the issue of whether one should be able to trust whether the various copies of a single book will have the same content.\\"Tl√∂n‚Ä¶\\", p. 111‚Äì2. At the end Borges is working on a \\"tentative translation\\" of an English- language work into Spanish, while the power of the ideas of \\"a scattered dynasty of solitaries\\" remakes the world in the image of Tl√∂n.\\"Tl√∂n‚Ä¶\\", p. 122. Along the way we have stone mirrors;\\"Tl√∂n...\\", p.113 the idea of reconstructing an entire encyclopedia of an imaginary world based on a single volume;\\"Tl√∂n...\\", p.114 the analogy of that encyclopedia to a \\"cosmos\\" governed by \\"strict laws\\"; a worldview in which our normal notions of \\"thing\\" are rejected, but \\"ideal objects abound, invoked and dissolved momentarily, according to poetic necessity\\"; the universe conceived as \\"the handwriting of a minor god to communicate with a demon\\" or a \\"code system... in which not all symbols have meaning\\";\\"Tl√∂n‚Ä¶\\", p. 117 hr√∂nir, duplicates of objects called into existence by ignorance or hope, and where \\"those of the eleventh degree have a purity of form that the originals do not possess\\"; and Ezra Buckley's wish \\"to demonstrate to a nonexistent God that mortal men were capable of conceiving a world.\\" Borges also mentions in passing the duodecimal system (as well as others). This ties into his description of Tl√∂n's arithmetic, which emphasizes indefinite numbers, and holds that a number does not actually have any value or independent existence until it is counted/named. However, some may see the reference to the duodecimal system as inherently refuting of the changeability of things due to nomenclature‚Äîa number may be renamed under a different counting schema, but the underlying value will always remain the same. Fact and fiction It is by no means simple to sort out fact and fiction within this story. The picture is further complicated by the fact that other authors (both in print and on the web) have chosen to join Borges in his game and write about one or another fictional aspect of this story either as if it were non-fiction or in a manner that could potentially confuse the unwary reader. Two online examples are the Italian-language website La Biblioteca di Uqbar, which treats Tl√∂n itself as duly fictional, but writes as if the fictional Silas Haslam's entirely imaginary History of the Land Called Uqbar were a real work. As a result, simply finding a reference to a person or place from \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" in a context seemingly unrelated to Borges's story is not enough to be confident that the person or place is real. See, for example, the discussion below of the character Silas Haslam. There in fact exists an Anglo-American Encyclopedia, which is a plagiarism, differently paginated, of the tenth edition of the Encyclopedia, and in which the 46th volume is TOT-UPS, ending on p. 917 with Upsala, and followed by Ural‚ÄìAltaic in the next volume; Uqbar would fall in between. In the 11th edition of the Britannica, Borges's favorite, there is an article in between these on \\"Ur\\"; which may, in some sense, therefore be Uqbar. Different articles in the 11th edition mention that Ur, as the name of a city, means simply \\"the city\\", and that Ur is also the aurochs, or the evil god of the Mandaeans. Borges may be punning on the sense of \\"primaeval\\" here with his repeated use of Ursprache,Conjecture due to Alan White, \\"An Appalling or Banal Reality\\" Variaciones Borges 15, 47-91. p. 52. Also,White's web site, un itled, accessed 3 August 2006. The Tenth Edition of the Britannica in fact has two alphabets of articles (one a reprint of the Ninth Edition, the other a supplement); the Anglo-American Encyclopedia merged these into one alphabet. One of the two parts of the Britannica also breaks at UPS. The other meanings of UR are not additional articles in the 11th, but they can be found in the index. or on the story's own definition of \\"ur\\" in one of Tl√∂n's languages as \\"a thing produced by suggestion, an object elicited by hope\\". =Levels of reality= There are several levels of reality (or unreality) in the story: * Most (but not all) of the people mentioned in the story are real, but the events in which they are involved are mostly fictional, as are some of the works attributed to them. This is discussed in detail in the section below on real and fictional people. * The main portion of the story is a fiction set in a naturalistic world; in the postscript, magical elements have entered the narrator's world. The main portion could certainly be seen as a false document; the postscript may dissolve the illusion. * The land of Uqbar is fictional from the point of view of the world of the story. The supposed Anglo-American Cyclopaedia article on Uqbar proves, within the story, to be a fictitious entry. * Mlejnas, and Tl√∂n as it is first introduced, are fictional from the point of view of Uqbar. In the course of the story, Tl√∂n becomes more and more \\"real\\": first it moves from being a fiction of Uqbar to being a fiction of the narrator's own naturalistic world, then it begins (first as idea and then physically) taking over that world, to the point of finally threatening to annihilate normal reality. =Real and fictional places= Possible location of Uqbar Uqbar in the story is doubly fictional: even within the world of the story it turns out to be a fictional place. The fictitious entry described in the story furnishes deliberately meager indications of Uqbar's location: \\"Of the fourteen names which figured in the geographical part, we only recognized three ‚Äì Khorasan, Armenia, Erzerum ‚Äì interpolated in the text in an ambiguous way.\\" Armenia and Erzerum lie in the eastern highlands of Asia Minor (in and near modern Turkey), while Khorasan is in northeastern Iran, though there is also a Horasan in eastern Turkey. However, it was said to have cited an equally nonexistent German-titled book ‚Äì Lesbare und lesenswerthe Bemerkungen √ºber das Land Ukkbar in Klein-Asien (\\"Legible and valuable observations over the Uqbar land in Asia Minor\\") ‚Äì whose title claims unambiguously that Uqbar was in Asia Minor. The boundaries of Uqbar were described using equally nonexistent reference points; for instance, \\"the lowlands of Tsai Khaldun and the Axa Delta marked the southern frontier\\" (see section Real and fictional place). This would suggest that the rivers of Borges' Uqbar should rise in highlands to the north; in fact, the mountainous highlands of eastern Turkey are where not one but two Zab Rivers rise, the Great Zab and the Lesser Zab. They run a couple of hundred miles south into the Tigris. The only points of Uqbar's history mentioned relate to religion, literature, and craft. It was described as the home of a noted heresiarch, and the scene of religious persecutions directed against the orthodox in the thirteenth century; fleeing the latter, its orthodox believers built obelisks in their southerly place of exile, and made mirrors ‚Äì seen by the heresiarch as abominable ‚Äì of stone. Crucially for the story, Uqbar's \\"epics and legends never referred to reality, but to the two imaginary regions of Mlejnas and Tl√∂n.\\" Although the culture of Uqbar described by Borges is fictional, there are two real places with similar names. These are: # The medieval city of ‚ÄòUkbar√¢ on the left bank of the Tigris between Samarra and Baghdad in what is now Iraq. This city was home to the great Islamic grammarian, philologist, and religious scholar Al-‚ÄòUkbar√Æ (c. 1143‚Äì1219) ‚Äì who was blind, like Borges's father and like Borges himself was later to become ‚Äì and to two notable early Jewish/Karaite \\"heresiarchs\\" (see above), leaders of Karaite movements opposed to Anan ben David, Ishmael al-Ukbari and Meshwi al-Ukbari, mentioned in the Jewish Encyclopedia of 1901‚Äì1906.Singer, Isidore and Broyd√©, Isaac, Meshwi al-‚ÄòUkbari, Jewish Encyclopedia, 1901‚Äì1906. Accessed online 9 September 2006. # ‚ÄòUqb√¢r in the Atlas Mountains of Algeria; the minarets of the latter's area might relate to the \\"obelisks\\" of Uqbar in the story. Tsai Khaldun is undoubtedly a tribute to the great historian Ibn Khaldun, who lived in Andalusia for a while; his history focuses on North Africa and was probably a major source for Borges. Additionally, \\"tsai\\" comes from the Mandarin Chinese word Ëèú (c√†i), which refers to green leafy vegetables. Other places named in the story ‚Äì Khorasan, Armenia, and Erzerum in the Middle East, and various locations in Europe and the Americas ‚Äì are real. The Axa Delta, mentioned in the same context as Tsai Khaldun, appears to be fictional. =Real and fictional people= Listed here in order of their appearance in the story: * Jorge Luis Borges (1899‚Äì1986)‚ÄîAuthor and first person narrator of the story. * Adolfo Bioy Casares (1914‚Äì1999)‚Äînon-fictional, Argentinian fiction-writer, a friend and frequent collaborator of Borges. * An unnamed \\"heresiarch of Uqbar\\" is credited for the statement that \\"mirrors and copulation are abominable because they increase the number of men\\". This echoes Borges' own summary of the teachings of Al-Muqanna (d. ca. 783), a Persian prophet regarded by his orthodox Muslim contemporaries as a heresiarch. In the previously-published short story collection A Universal History of Infamy, Borges wrote the following as part of a summary of his message: \\"The world we live in is a mistake, a clumsy parody. Mirrors and fatherhood, because they multiply and confirm the parody, are abominations.\\" * Justus Perthes (1749‚Äì1816)‚Äînon- fictional, 18th century founder of a German publishing firm that bears his name; undoubtedly, the story is accurate in implying the firm's atlases do not mention Uqbar. * Carl Ritter (1779‚Äì1859)‚Äîone of the founders of modern geography. In the story, Borges notes the absence of any mention of Uqbar in Ritter's cartographic index Erdkunde. (In the story, only the surname is given.) * Smerdis (d. 522 BC)‚ÄîThe story refers in passing to \\"the impostor, Smerdis the Magician\\". After the death of the actual Smerdis (son of Cyrus the Great of Persia) a Magian priest named Gaumata successfully impersonated him for several months and ruled in his stead. * Bernard Quaritch (1819‚Äì1899)‚ÄîAn actual nineteenth-century bookseller in London. The bookstore bearing his name still survives.Bernard Quaritch, Antiquarian bookseller, official site. Accessed 14 November 2006. In the story, his catalogues include Silas Haslam's History of the Land Called Uqbar. * Silas Haslam‚ÄîEntirely fictional, but based on Borges' English ancestors. \\"Haslam\\" was Borges's paternal grandmother's maiden name. In the story, besides the 1874 History of the Land Called Uqbar, a footnote informs us that Haslam is also the author of A General History of Labyrinths (labyrinths as well as playfully fake literary references are a recurring theme in Borges's work). Silas Haslam is an entirely fictional character. However, Haslam's \\"General History of Labyrinths\\" has been cited twice in reputable, peer-reviewed scientific literature: in \\"Complexity of two-dimensional patterns\\", by Kristian Lindgren, Christopher Moore, and Mats Nordahl (published in the June 1998 edition of the Journal of Statistical Physics) and \\"Order parameter equations for front transitions: Nonuniformly curved fronts,\\" by A.

In the story, he finds a copy of the Anglo-American Cyclopaedia that omits the Uqbar pages. * Herbert Ashe (d. 1937)‚Äîpresumably fictional, based on one or more of Borges's father's English friends. He shares with Xul Solar (see below) an interest in the duodecimal numeral system (in which twelve is written as 10.) * N√©stor Ibarra, Ezequiel Mart√≠nez Estrada (1895‚Äì1964), and (Pierre) Drieu La Rochelle (1893‚Äì1945)‚Äîall historical, described in the story as engaged in a dispute over whether the discovery of A First Encyclopaedia of Tl√∂n. Volume XI. Hlaer to Jangr implies the existence of the other volumes to which it makes references. Ibarra was a noted Argentinian poet (and Borges's translator into French); Estrada, an Argentinian, was the author of, among other works, Muerte y transfiguraci√≥n de Mart√≠n Fierro (\\"Death and Transfiguration of Mart√≠n Fierro\\"), a major commentary on Argentina's most famous nineteenth century literary work. Drieu La Rochelle, who was to commit suicide after becoming infamous for his collaboration with the Nazis during the Occupation of France, was one of the few foreign contributors to Sur, Victoria Ocampo's Argentine journal to which Borges was a regular contributor. * Alfonso Reyes (1889‚Äì1959)‚ÄîMexican diplomat who served for a time in Argentina. In the story, he proposes to recreate the missing volumes of A First Encyclopaedia of Tl√∂n. * The philosopher Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716) is mentioned in passing, and Hume (1711‚Äì1776) is mentioned for finding Berkeley \\"unanswerable but thoroughly unconvincing.\\" * Bishop George Berkeley (1685‚Äì1753), a driving engine of the story, was the founder of the modern school of philosophical idealism. * Xul Solar (1887‚Äì1963)‚Äîadopted name of Oscar Agust√≠n Alejandro Schulz Solari, Argentinian watercolorist, esotericist, and (presumably most relevant here) inventor of imaginary languages. In the real world a close associate of Borges and a member of the Florida group; in the story, he skillfully translates one of the languages of the Southern Hemisphere of Tl√∂n. * Alexius Meinong (1853‚Äì1920)‚ÄîAustrian psychologist and philosopher, who wrote Gegenstandstheorie (\\"The theory of objects\\"), where he wrote at length about the notion of objects that exist only in our minds. He is referred to by his surname in the story; his theories are alluded to by way of explaining the languages of the Northern Hemisphere of Tl√∂n. Presumably, Borges is acknowledging where he got the idea for this imaginary family of languages. * Bertrand Russell (1872‚Äì1970)‚ÄîBritish philosopher. In a footnote, the story refers (accurately) to his conjecture that (in Borges's words) \\"our planet was created a few moments ago, and provided with a humanity which 'remembers' an illusory past.\\"The Analysis of Mind, 1921, p. 159, cited in \\"Gu√≠a de lectura‚Ä¶\\" * Baruch Spinoza (1632‚Äì1677)‚ÄîDutch / Portuguese Jewish philosopher, referred to in the story by his surname, and accurately paraphrased: \\"Spinoza attributes to his inexhaustible divinity the attributes of extension and of thought.\\" * Similarly, the story's use of the German- language phrase Philosophie des Als Ob refers to philosopher Hans Vaihinger (1852‚Äì1933), whose book of this name (first edition: 1911) puts forward the notion that some human concepts are simply useful fictions. * The ancient Greek philosopher Zeno (490‚Äì430 BC) is accurately alluded to in the story for his paradoxes denying the possibility of motion, based on the indivisibility of time. * The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788‚Äì1860), as with Meinong, is acknowledged, in this case for his Parerga und Paralipomena, which Borges (apparently falsely) claims parallels a Tl√∂nist \\"idealist pantheism\\". This is really the absolute idealism of Schopenhauer's despised rival, Hegel (1770‚Äì1831), which was derived from Spinoza's pantheism. Schopenhauer does not assert that there is only one subject and that this one subject is every being in the universe; on the contrary, he asserts that each individual observing animal is a unique subject, having its own point of view of the objects that it experiences. Presumably Borges's related remark about preserving a psychological basis for the sciences is something of a joke on preserving a scientific basis for psychology. * William Shakespeare (1564‚Äì1616)‚ÄîEnglish poet, playwright, and actor.

In \\"Tl√∂n...\\", the letter from Gunnar Erfjord is found \\"in a volume of Hinton\\", presumably invoked for his interest in extra dimensions and parallel worlds. * George Dalgarno (1626‚Äì1687), seventeenth- century Scottish intellectual with an interest in linguistics, and inventor of a language for deaf mutes. He is alluded to by his last name as an early member (along with Berkeley) of the fictional secret society that sets in motion the story of the doubly fictional Uqbar (and the triply fictional Tl√∂n). * Ezra Buckley (d. 1848), the eccentric American benefactor who expands the scale of the Uqbarist enterprise to a full Tl√∂nist encyclopedic undertaking, is entirely fictional. It has been conjectured that there is an allusion to Ezra Pound. * Mar√≠a Lidia Lloveras (1898‚Äì?)‚ÄîArgentinian, married into an old French noble family, making her Princess Faucigny Lucinge.

In the story, along with Borges, he witnesses the Tl√∂nic coins that have fallen from the pocket of a dead man. * Francisco de Quevedo (1580‚Äì1645)‚ÄîBaroque Spanish poet and picaresque novelist, is alluded to here simply for his writing style. * Thomas Browne (1605‚Äì1682), seventeenth-century English physician and essayist, is indeed the author of Urn Burial, which at the end of the story the fictional Borges is translating, though without intent to publish. Context in Borges's life and works \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" formed part of a 1941 collection of stories called El jard√≠n de senderos que se bifurcan (\\"The Garden of Forking Paths\\"). At the time he wrote \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" in early 1940, Borges was little known outside of Argentina. He was working in a local public library in Buenos Aires, and had a certain local fame as a translator of works from English, French and German, and as an avant garde poet and essayist (having published regularly in widely read Argentinian periodicals such as El Hogar, as well as in many smaller magazines, such as Victoria Ocampo's Sur, where \\"Tl√∂n...\\" was originally published). In the previous two years he had been through a great deal: his father had died in 1938, and on Christmas Eve 1938, Borges himself had suffered a severe head wound in an accident; during treatment for that wound, he nearly died of a blood infection. For some time before his father's death and his own accident, Borges had been drifting toward writing fiction. His Historia universal de la infamia (Universal History of Infamy), published in 1935, used a baroque writing style and the techniques of fiction to tell the stories of seven historical rogues. These ranged from \\"El espantoso redentor Lazarus Morell\\" (\\"The Dread Redeemer Lazarus Morell\\")‚Äîwho promised liberty to slaves in the American South, but brought them only death‚Äîto \\"El incivil maestro de ceremonias Kotsuk√© no Suk√©\\" (\\"The Insulting Master of Etiquette K√¥tsuk√© no Suk√©\\"), the story of the central figure in the Japanese Tale of the 47 Ronin, also known as Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka. Borges had also written a number of clever literary forgeries disguised as translations from authors such as Emanuel Swedenborg or from Don Juan Manuel's Tales of Count Lucanor. Recovering from his head wound and infection, Borges decided it was time to turn to the writing of fiction as such. Several of these fictions, notably \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" and \\"Pierre Menard, autor del Quijote\\" (\\"Pierre Menard, Author of The Quixote\\", published ten months earlier in Sur, and also included in El jard√≠n de senderos que se bifurcan), could only have been written by an experienced essayist. Both of these works apply Borges's essayistic style to largely imaginary subject matter. His massive erudition is as evident in these fictions as in any non-fictional essay in his body of works. Buenos Aires was, at this time, a thriving intellectual center. While Europe was immersed in World War II, Argentina, and Buenos Aires in particular, flourished intellectually and artistically. (This situation was to change during the presidency of Juan Per√≥n and the subsequent military governments, where many of Argentina's leading intellectuals went into exile, something that Borges and most of his circle did not contemplate.) Borges's first volume of fiction failed to garner the literary prizes many in his circle expected for it. Victoria Ocampo dedicated a large portion of the July 1942 issue of Sur to a \\"Reparation for Borges\\"; numerous leading writers and critics from Argentina and throughout the Spanish-speaking world contributed writings to the project, which probably brought his work as much attention as a prize would have. Over the next few decades \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" and Borges's other fiction from this period formed a key part of the body of work that put Latin America on the international literary map. Borges was to become more widely known throughout the world as a writer of extremely original short stories than as a poet and essayist. Publication history \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" originally appeared in Spanish in SUR in May 1940. The Spanish- language original was then published in book form in Antolog√≠a de la Literatura Fant√°stica ‚ÄîDecember 1940‚Äî, then in Borges's 1941 collection El Jard√≠n de senderos que se bifurcan (The Garden of Forking Paths). That entire book was, in turn, included within Ficciones (1944), a much-reprinted book (15 editions in Argentina by 1971). The first published English-language translation was by James E. Irby. It appeared in the April 1961 issue of New World Writing. The following year, Irby's translation was included as the first piece in a diverse collection of Borges works entitled Labyrinths. Almost simultaneously, and independently, the piece was translated by Alastair Reid; Reid's version was published in 1962 as part of a collaborative English- language translation of the entirety of Ficciones. The Reid translation is reprinted in Borges, a Reader (1981, ), p. 111‚Äì122. Quotations and page references in this article follow that translation. It was a finalist for the Retro Hugo Award for Best Short Story from 1940 (in 2016). It is the first non-English work to be nominated in its original language rather than as a translation. According to the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard, \\"Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" is \\"the best short story ever written.\\"https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-karl-ove- knausgaard-writing-cc34a354fed7 Influence on later works \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" has inspired a number of real-world projects: * \\"Small Demons\\", a website that \\"obsessively maps out cultural allusions found in books\\", was inspired by Borges, according to CEO Valla Vakili: \\"The inspiration for the name comes from the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges, specifically a passage in his short story 'Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius'. Borges writes, 'The history of the universe‚Ä¶ is the handwriting produced by a Minor god in order to communicate with a Demon.' I read that as, the history of the universe is all the stories ever told. Minor gods are the storytellers who rule the worlds of their stories. And the Demon is the force that drives the need for stories, the place where author and reader meet. I took 'Minor' and 'Demon' and from there, Small Demons.\\" * \\"Prisoners of Uqbaristan\\", a short story by Chris Nakashima-Brown in which Borges himself appears, is heavily influenced by the philosophy of Tl√∂n. * Codex Seraphinianus, a mock encyclopedia by Luigi Serafini, describes a surreal world entirely in drawings, an invented alphabet, and a fictional language. * Ummo, a hoax of more than one thousand pages of pictures and text in letter form, describes an extraterrestrial civilization and its contact with Earth.

(1992, Souvenir Press, , pages 111-113) * The Borges story directly inspired Grant Morrison's creation of the cancerous and fictional city of Orqwith in the DC Comics series Doom Patrol. In the comic book storyline, a group of intellectuals uses a tactile, braille-like language to create a black book describing the city of Orqwith. As people on different planets encounter the book, it infects their worlds, overcoming them in the way a malignant tumor would. Thus different sections of the planets are sliced off, only to be replaced with Orqwith. * Tl√∂n is featured in the Marvel Comics series Secret Avengers by Ales Kot and Michael Walsh, as a chaotic dimension the villain M.O.D.O.K. plans to bring monstrosities from to destroy the Earth. A chain of people that created a communal mindspace based on negative emotions is used to open a gate to Tl√∂n. The plan, ultimately carried by M.O.D.O.K.'s assistant Snapper, is thwarted by the Secret Avengers and M.O.D.O.K. himself. In the end of the storyline, one of the characters, a sentient bomb named Vladimir, is transported to Tl√∂n, where he meets an unseen entity he initially identifies as \\"Jorg--\\" before being interrupted by the entity himself. The story Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius is explicitly referenced by characters that investigated Tl√∂n. *In Ted Chiang's story The Lifecycle of Software Objects, one of the virtual worlds mentioned is called Orbis Tertius.

It was probably written around 1593. It is labelled a history in the First Folio, and is usually considered one, but it is sometimes called a tragedy, as in the quarto edition. Richard III concludes Shakespeare's first tetralogy (also containing Henry VI, Part 1, and Henry VI, Part 2, and Henry VI, Part 3) and depicts the Machiavellian rise to power and subsequent short reign of King Richard III of England. It is the second longest play in the Shakespearean canon, and is the longest of the First Folio, whose version of Hamlet, otherwise the longest, is shorter than its quarto counterpart. The play is often abridged, and peripheral characters removed. In such cases, extra lines are often invented or added from elsewhere to establish the nature of the characters' relationships. A further reason for abridgment is that Shakespeare assumed his audiences' familiarity with his Henry VI plays, frequently referring to these plays.

Shakespeare, Act 5, Scene 9, painting by Nicolai Abildgaard. Nivaagaard Collection. The play begins with Richard (Gloucester) describing the re-accession to the throne of his brother, King Edward IV of England, eldest son of the late Richard, Duke of York (implying the year is 1471): Richard is an ugly hunchback, \\"rudely stamp'd\\", \\"deformed, unfinish'd\\", cannot \\"strut before a wanton ambling nymph\\", and says he is \\"determined to prove a villain / And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\\" Through a prophecy, that \\"G of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be\\", he has contrived to have his brother Clarence conducted to the Tower of London (the king interpreted the prophecy as _G_ eorge of Clarence). Speaking to Clarence en route, Richard blames the queen and says that he will himself try to help Clarence. Richard continues plotting: Lady Anne attends the corpse of Henry VI with Trestle and Berkeley going from St Paul's Cathedral. She bids them set down the \\"honourable load\\" then laments. Richard appears, and Lady Anne says that \\"Henry's wounds [...] bleed afresh\\". He confesses the murder, and she spits at him. He offers himself to her sword, but she drops it. He offers to kill himself at her order, but she accepts his ring. Richard exults at having won her over so and tells the audience that he will discard her once she has served his purpose. The atmosphere at court is poisonous. The established nobles are at odds with the upwardly mobile relatives of Queen Elizabeth, a hostility fueled by Richard's machinations. Queen Margaret, Henry VI's widow, returns, though banished, and she warns the squabbling nobles about Richard, cursing extensively. The nobles, all Yorkists, unite against this last Lancastrian and ignore the warnings. Richard orders two murderers to kill Clarence in the tower. Clarence relates a distressing dream to his keeper before going to sleep. The murderers arrive with a warrant, and the keeper relinquishes his office. While the murderers are pondering what to do, Clarence wakes. He recognises their purpose and pleads with them. Presuming that Edward has offered them payment, he tells them to go to Gloucester, who will reward them better for having kept him alive. One of the murderers explains that Gloucester hates him and sent them. Pleading again, he is eventually interrupted by \\"Look behind you, my lord\\" and stabbing. The compacted nobles pledge absent enmities before Edward, and Elizabeth asks Edward to receive Clarence into favour. Richard rebukes her, saying: \\"Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?\\". Edward, who has confessed himself near death, is much upset by this news and led off. Richard blames those attending Edward. Edward IV soon dies, leaving Richard as Protector. Lord Rivers, Lord Grey, and Sir Thomas Vaughan, have been imprisoned. The uncrowned Edward V and his brother are coaxed (by Richard) into an extended stay at the Tower of London. Assisted by his cousin Buckingham, Richard mounts a campaign to present himself as the true heir to the throne, pretending to be a modest and devout man with no pretensions to greatness. Lord Hastings, who objects to Richard's accession, is arrested and executed on a trumped-up charge of treason. Richard and Buckingham spread the rumour that Edward's two sons are illegitimate and therefore have no rightful claim to the throne, and they are assisted by Catesby, Ratcliffe, and Lovell. The other lords are cajoled into accepting Richard as king despite the continued survival of his nephews (the Princes in the Tower). English actor David Garrick as Richard III just before the battle of Bosworth Field. His sleep having been haunted by the ghosts of those he has murdered, he wakes to the realisation that he is alone in the world and death is imminent. The painting, David Garrick as Richard III (1745), by William Hogarth. Richard asks Buckingham to secure the death of the princes, but Buckingham hesitates. Richard then recruits Sir James Tyrrell who kills both children. When Richard denies Buckingham a promised land grant, Buckingham turns against Richard and defects to the side of Henry, Earl of Richmond, who is currently in exile. Richard has his eye on Elizabeth of York, Edward IV's next remaining heir, and poisons Lady Anne so he can be free to woo the princess. The Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth mourn the princes' deaths. Queen Margaret meets them. As predicted, Queen Elizabeth asks Queen Margaret for help in cursing. Later, the Duchess applies this lesson and curses her only surviving son before leaving. Richard asks Queen Elizabeth to help him win her daughter's hand in marriage. She is not taken in by his eloquence, and stalls him by saying that she will let him know her daughter's answer in due course. The increasingly paranoid Richard loses what popularity he had. He faces rebellions, led first by Buckingham and subsequently by the invading Richmond. Buckingham is captured and executed. Both sides arrive for a final battle at Bosworth Field. Prior to the battle, Richard is sleeping and visited by the ghosts of his victims, each telling him to \\"Despair and die\\". They likewise attend and wish victory on Richmond. Richard wakes, screaming \\"Jesus\\", then realises that he is all alone and cannot even pity himself. At the Battle of Bosworth Field, Lord Stanley (who is also Richmond's stepfather) and his followers desert Richard, whereupon Richard calls for the execution of George Stanley, hostage and Lord Stanley's son. But this does not happen, as the battle is in full swing, and Richard is at a disadvantage. Richard is unhorsed on the field, and cries out, \\"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse\\". Richmond kills Richard, and claims the throne as Henry VII. Date and text The first page of Richard III, printed in the Second Folio of 1632 Richard III is believed to be one of Shakespeare's earlier plays, preceded only by the three parts of Henry VI and perhaps Titus Andronicus and a handful of comedies. It is believed to have been written c. 1592‚Äì1594. Although Richard III was entered into the Register of the Stationers' Company on 20 October 1597 by the bookseller Andrew Wise, who published the first Quarto (Q1) later that year (with printing done by Valentine Simmes), See title page of facsimile of the original 1st edition (1597) Christopher Marlowe's Edward II, which cannot have been written much later than 1592 (Marlowe died in 1593), is thought to have been influenced by it. A second Quarto (Q2) followed in 1598, printed by Thomas Creede for Andrew Wise, containing an attribution to Shakespeare on its title page.British Library Q3 appeared in 1602, Q4 in 1605, Q5 in 1612, and Q6 in 1622, the frequency attesting to its popularity. The First Folio version followed in 1623. The Folio is longer than the Quarto and contains some fifty additional passages amounting to more than two hundred lines. However, the Quarto contains some twenty-seven passages amounting to about thirty-seven lines that are absent from the Folio. The two texts also contain hundreds of other differences, including the transposition of words within speeches, the movement of words from one speech to another, the replacement of words with near-synonyms, and many changes in grammar and spelling. At one time, it was thought that the Quarto represented a separate revision of the play by Shakespeare. However, since the Quarto contains many changes that can only be regarded as mistakes, it is now widely believed that the Quarto was produced by memorial reconstruction. It is thought likely that the Quarto was collectively produced by a company of actors remembering their lines. It is unknown why the actors did this, but it may have been to replace a missing prompt book. The Folio is regarded as having much higher authority than the Quarto, but because the Folio edition was collated by the printers against a Quarto (probably Q3), some errors from the Quarto found their way into the Folio. Some parts of the Folio (the beginning of Act III and much of Act V) are clearly copied, with little change, direct from the Quarto. The Folio also has its own corruptions and omissions, and corrections have to be supplied, where possible, from the Quarto. Themes =Comedic elements= Unlike his previous tragedy Titus Andronicus, the play avoids graphic demonstrations of physical violence; only Richard and Clarence are shown being stabbed on-stage, while the rest (the two princes, Hastings, Brackenbury, Grey, Vaughan, Rivers, Anne, Buckingham, and King Edward) all meet their ends off-stage. Despite the villainous nature of the title character and the grim storyline, Shakespeare infuses the action with comic material, as he does with most of his tragedies. Much of the humour rises from the dichotomy between how Richard's character is known and how Richard tries to appear. Richard himself also provides some dry remarks in evaluating the situation, as when he plans to marry Queen Elizabeth's daughter: \\"Murder her brothers, then marry her; Uncertain way of gain ...\\" Other examples of humour in this play include Clarence's reluctant murderers, and the Duke of Buckingham's report on his attempt to persuade the Londoners to accept Richard (\\"I bid them that did love their country's good cry, God save Richard, England's royal king!\\" Richard: \\"And did they so?\\" Buckingham: \\"No, so God help me, they spake not a word ...\\") Puns, a Shakespearean staple, are especially well represented in the scene where Richard tries to persuade Queen Elizabeth to woo her daughter on his behalf. =Free will and fatalism= Queen Margaret: \\"Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!\\" Act 1, Scene III. The boar was Richard's personal symbol: Bronze boar mount thought to have been worn by a supporter of Richard III. One of the central themes of Richard III is the idea of fate, especially as it is seen through the tension between free will and fatalism in Richard's actions and speech, as well as the reactions to him by other characters. There is no doubt that Shakespeare drew heavily on Sir Thomas More's account of Richard III as a criminal and tyrant as inspiration for his own rendering. This influence, especially as it relates to the role of divine punishment in Richard's rule of England, reaches its height in the voice of Margaret. Janis Lull suggests that \\"Margaret gives voice to the belief, encouraged by the growing Calvinism of the Elizabethan era, that individual historical events are determined by God, who often punishes evil with (apparent) evil\\". Thus it seems possible that Shakespeare, in conforming to the growing \\"Tudor Myth\\" of the day, as well as taking into account new theologies of divine action and human will becoming popular in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, sought to paint Richard as the final curse of God on England in punishment for the deposition of Richard II in 1399. Irving Ribner argued that \\"the evil path of Richard is a cleansing operation which roots evil out of society and restores the world at last to the God-ordained goodness embodied in the new rule of Henry VII\\". Scholar Victor Kiernan writes that this interpretation is a perfect fit with the English social perspective of Shakespeare's day: \\"An extension is in progress of a privileged class's assurance of preferential treatment in the next world as in this, to a favoured nation's conviction of having God on its side, of Englishmen being ... the new Chosen People\\". As Elizabethan England was slowly colonising the world, the populace embraced the view of its own Divine Right and Appointment to do so, much as Richard does in Shakespeare's play. However, historical fatalism is merely one side of the argument of fate versus free will. It is also possible that Shakespeare intended to portray Richard as \\"a personification of the Machiavellian view of history as power politics\\". In this view, Richard is acting entirely out of his own free will in brutally taking hold of the English throne. Kiernan also presents this side of the coin, noting that Richard \\"boasts to us of his finesse in dissembling and deception with bits of Scripture to cloak his 'naked villainy' (I.iii.334‚Äì348) ...Machiavelli, as Shakespeare may want us to realise, is not a safe guide to practical politics\\". Kiernan suggests that Richard is merely acting as if God is determining his every step in a sort of Machiavellian manipulation of religion as an attempt to circumvent the moral conscience of those around him. Therefore, historical determinism is merely an illusion perpetrated by Richard's assertion of his own free will. The Machiavellian reading of the play finds evidence in Richard's interactions with the audience, as when he mentions that he is \\"determin√®d to prove a villain\\" (I.i.30). However, though it seems Richard views himself as completely in control, Lull suggests that Shakespeare is using Richard to state \\"the tragic conception of the play in a joke. His primary meaning is that he controls his own destiny. His pun also has a second, contradictory meaning‚Äîthat his villainy is predestined‚Äîand the strong providentialism of the play ultimately endorses this meaning\\". Literary critic Paul Haeffner writes that Shakespeare had a great understanding of language and the potential of every word he used. One word that Shakespeare gave potential to was \\"joy\\". This is employed in Act I, Scene III, where it is used to show \\"deliberate emotional effect\\". Another word that Haeffner points out is \\"kind\\", which he suggests is used with two different definitions. The first definition is used to express a \\"gentle and loving\\" man, which Clarence uses to describe his brother Richard to the murderers that were sent to kill him. This definition is not true, as Richard uses a gentle fa√ßade to seize the throne. The second definition concerns \\"the person's true nature ... Richard will indeed use Hastings kindly‚Äîthat is, just as he is in the habit of using people‚Äîbrutally\\". Haeffner also writes about how speech is written. He compares the speeches of Richmond and Richard to their soldiers. He describes Richmond's speech as \\"dignified\\" and formal, while Richard's speech is explained as \\"slangy and impetuous\\". Richard's casualness in speech is also noted by another writer. However, Lull does not make the comparison between Richmond and Richard as Haeffner does, but between Richard and the women in his life. However, it is important to the women share the formal language that Richmond uses. She makes the argument that the difference in speech \\"reinforces the thematic division between the women's identification with the social group and Richard's individualism\\". Haeffner agrees that Richard is \\"an individualist, hating dignity and formality\\". Janis Lull also takes special notice of the mourning women. She suggests that they are associated with \\"figures of repetition as anaphora‚Äîbeginning each clause in a sequence with the same word‚Äîand epistrophe‚Äîrepeating the same word at the end of each clause\\". One example of the epistrophe can be found in Margaret's speech in Act I, Scene III. Haeffner refers to these as few of many \\"devices and tricks of style\\" that occur in the play, showcasing Shakespeare's ability to bring out the potential of every word. =Richard as anti-hero= Throughout the play, Richard's character constantly changes and shifts and, in doing so, alters the dramatic structure of the story. Richard immediately establishes a connection with the audience with his opening monologue. In the soliloquy he admits his amorality to the audience but at the same time treats them as if they were co-conspirators in his plotting; one may well be enamored of his rhetoricSila Senlen. \\"Chapter 3: Rhetoric in the Hands of the Machiavellian Villain: William Shakespeare's Richard III\\". In Words as Swords: Verbal Violence as a Construction of Authority in Renaissance and Contemporary English Drama. Stuttgart: ibidem verlag, 2009. pp. 60‚Äì95. while being appalled by his actions. Richard shows off his wit in Act I, as seen in the interchanges with Lady Anne (Act I, Scene II) and his brother Clarence (Act I, Scene I). In his dialogues in Act I, Richard knowingly refers to thoughts he has only previously shared with the audience to keep the audience attuned to him and his objectives. In 1.1, Richard tells the audience in a soliloquy how he plans to claw his way to the throne‚Äîkilling his brother Clarence as a necessary step to get there. However, Richard pretends to be Clarence's friend, falsely reassuring him by saying, \\"I will deliver you, or else lie for you\\" (1.1.115); which the audience knows‚Äîand Richard tells the audience after Clarence's exit‚Äîis the exact opposite of what he plans to do. Scholar Michael E. Mooney describes Richard as occupying a \\"figural position\\"; he is able to move in and out of it by talking with the audience on one level, and interacting with other characters on another. Each scene in Act I is book-ended by Richard directly addressing the audience. This action on Richard's part not only keeps him in control of the dramatic action of the play, but also of how the audience sees him: in a somewhat positive light, or as the protagonist. Richard actually embodies the dramatic character of \\"Vice\\" from medieval morality plays‚Äîwith which Shakespeare was very familiar from his time‚Äîwith his \\"impish-to-fiendish humour\\". Like Vice, Richard is able to render what is ugly and evil‚Äîhis thoughts and aims, his view of other characters‚Äîinto what is charming and amusing for the audience. In the earlier acts of the play, too, the role of the antagonist is filled by that of the old Lancastrian queen, Margaret, who is reviled by the Yorkists and whom Richard manipulates and condemns in Act I, Scene III. However, after Act I, the number and quality of Richard's asides to the audience decrease significantly, as well as multiple scenes are interspersed that do not include Richard at all, but average Citizens (Act II, Scene III), or the Duchess of York and Clarence's children (Act II, Scene II), who are as moral as Richard is evil. Without Richard guiding the audience through the dramatic action, the audience is left to evaluate for itself what is going on. In Act IV, Scene IV, after the murder of the two young princes and the ruthless murder of Lady Anne, the women of the play‚ÄîQueen Elizabeth, the Duchess of York, and even Margaret‚Äîgather to mourn their state and to curse Richard; and it is difficult as the audience not to sympathise with them. When Richard enters to bargain with Queen Elizabeth for her daughter's hand‚Äîa scene whose form echoes the same rhythmically quick dialogue as the Lady Anne scene in Act I‚Äîhe has lost his vivacity and playfulness for communication; it is obvious he is not the same man. By the end of Act IV everyone else in the play, including Richard's own mother, the Duchess, has turned against him. He does not interact with the audience nearly as much, and the inspiring quality of his speech has declined into merely giving and requiring information. As Richard gets closer to seizing the crown, he encloses himself within the world of the play; no longer embodying his facile movement in and out of the dramatic action, he is now stuck firmly within it. It is from Act IV that Richard really begins his rapid decline into truly being the antagonist. Shakespeare scholar Stephen Greenblatt notes how Richard even refers to himself as \\"the formal Vice, Iniquity\\" (3.1.82), which informs the audience that he knows what his function is; but also like Vice in the morality plays, the fates will turn and get Richard in the end, which Elizabethan audiences would have recognised. In addition, the character of Richmond enters into the play in Act V to overthrow Richard and save the state from his tyranny, effectively being the instantaneous new protagonist. Richmond is a clear contrast to Richard's evil character, which makes the audience see him as such.

Below him is quoted the line \\"Off with his head; so much for Buckingham\\", a line not from the original play but from adaptations. The earliest certain performance occurred on 1633, when Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria watched it on the Queen's birthday. Cast of a 2018 production of Richard III at the Abbey Theatre. Colley Cibber produced the most successful of the Restoration adaptations of Shakespeare with his version of Richard III, at Drury Lane starting in 1700. Cibber himself played the role till 1739, and his version was on stage for the next century and a half. It contained the lines \\"Off with his head; so much for Buckingham\\" ‚Äì possibly the most famous Shakespearean line that Shakespeare did not write ‚Äì and \\"Richard's himself again!\\". The original Shakespearean version returned in a production at Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1845. Most film versions of Richard III feature actors who had previously played Richard on stage. The two best-known film versions are those with Laurence Olivier and Ian McKellen. McKellen's film is directly based on an earlier stage production set in a Nazified England of the 1930s, which toured Europe for six years to sell-out crowds prior to being shortly thereafter adapted to film. McKellen wrote the screenplay for his film version, although he did not direct it. Olivier played Richard on stage for quite a few years in the 1940s before making a film of it in 1955. His film performance, if not the production as a whole, is heavily based on his earlier stage rendition. The Al Pacino film Looking for Richard is a documentary of rehearsals of specific scenes from the play, and a meditation on the play's significance. Pacino had played the role on stage 15 years earlier. In 2011 film actor Kevin Spacey starred in an Old Vic production which subsequently toured the United States, directed by stage and film director Sam Mendes. Spacey had played the role of Richard's henchman, the Duke of Buckingham, in the Pacino film. Adaptations and cultural references =Film= Basil Rathbone played Richard III in the 1939 Universal horror film Tower of London, which was directed by Rowland V. Lee. The film was later remade by Roger Corman in 1962 with Vincent Price in the lead role. While both films are influenced by the characterisation and structure of Shakespeare‚Äôs play, neither includes any dialogue from it. The most famous player of the part in recent times was Laurence Olivier in his 1955 film version. Olivier's film incorporates a few scenes and speeches from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 and Cibber's rewrite of Shakespeare's play, but cuts entirely the characters of Queen Margaret and the Duchess of York, and Richard's soliloquy after seeing the ghosts of his victims. Olivier has Richard seduce Lady Anne while mourning over the corpse of her husband rather than her father-in-law as in the play. Olivier's rendition has been parodied by many comedians, including Peter Cook and Peter Sellers. Sellers, who had aspirations to do the role straight, appeared in a 1965 TV special on The Beatles' music by reciting \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" in the style of Olivier's Richard III. The first episode of the BBC television comedy Blackadder in part parodies the Olivier film, visually (as in the crown motif), Peter Cook's performance as a benevolent Richard, and by mangling Shakespearean text (\\"Now is the summer of our sweet content made o'ercast winter by these Tudor clouds ...\\") Richard Loncraine's 1995 film, starring Ian McKellen, is set in a fictional fascist England in the 1930s, and based on an earlier highly successful stage production. Only about half the text of the play is used. The first part of his \\"Now is the winter of our discontent...\\" soliloquy is a public speech, while the second part is a private monologue. The famous final line of Richard's \\"A horse, my kingdom for a horse\\" is spoken when his jeep becomes trapped after backing up into a large pile of rubble. In 1996, Al Pacino made his directoral debut and played the title role in Looking for Richard, analysing the plot of the play and playing out several scenes from it, as well as conducting a broader examination of Shakespeare's continuing role and relevance in popular culture. Also in 1996, a pristine print of Richard III (1912), starring Frederick Warde in the title role, was discovered by a private collector and donated to the American Film Institute. The 55-minute film is considered to be the earliest surviving American feature film. In 2002 the story of Richard III was re-told in a movie about gang culture called King Rikki (also known as The Street King). In 2017, Italian director Roberta Torre realized a musical drama film, inspired on Shakespeare's play, named Bloody Richard. =Television= The BBC Television Shakespeare version, first broadcast in 1983, starred Ron Cook as Richard. BBC Two aired a new adaptation of Richard III in 2016 as part of The Hollow Crown series, with Benedict Cumberbatch playing the king. Executive producer Pippa Harris commented, \\"By filming the Henry VI plays as well as Richard III, we will allow viewers to fully appreciate how such a monstrous tyrant could find his way to power, bringing even more weight and depth to this iconic character.\\" =References in popular culture= Lincoln's assassination Abraham Lincoln was renowned for his love of Shakespeare, and of Richard III in particular.See Carter, Stephen L, \\"What Abraham Lincoln Liked about Richard III\\" This fed Confederate propaganda, especially in Virginia, where residents of Richmond saw Lincoln as a Richard-like tyrant and identified their capital city with the Earl of Richmond, the hero of Shakespeare's play. (See photo of Richmond slaying Richard, above.) Some interpreted Richard's Act IV speech as an omen favorable to the South: The connection between Lincoln and the play was indelibly printed on history when on 14 April 1865, within a fortnight of the president's visit to the defeated city, he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Shakespearean actor known for playing both Richard and Richmond. Booth's notorious, final words from the stage were \\"Sic semper tyrannis\\". \\"Winter of our discontent\\" quote The 2010 film, The King's Speech, features a scene where the king's speech therapist Lionel Logue, as played by Geoffrey Rush, auditions for the role by reciting the lines, \\"Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this sun [or son] of York\\". Shakespeare critic Keith Jones believes that the film in general sets up its main character as a kind of antithesis to Richard III.Shakespeare in King's Speech The same antithesis was noted by conservative commentator Noah Millman.[Millman, Noah. \\"Weekly Double Feature: Richard III and The King's Speech\\" The American Conservative 24 March 2012 In the Red Dwarf episode \\"Marooned\\", Rimmer objects to Lister's burning of the Complete Works of Shakespeare in an attempt to maintain enough heat to keep him alive. When challenged, Rimmer claims he can quote from it and embarks upon the soliloquy: \\"Now! ... That's all I can remember. You know! That famous speech from Richard III ‚Äì 'now, something something something something'.\\" John Steinbeck used the opening line for the title of his novel The Winter of Our Discontent. The phrase \\"Winter of Discontent\\" is an expression, popularised by the British media, referring to the winter of 1978‚Äì79 in the United Kingdom, during which there were widespread strikes by local authority trade unions demanding larger pay rises for their members. \\"My kingdom for a horse\\" quote In the 1949 Looney Tunes cartoon A Ham in a Role, the dog actor says the Catesby and Richard III's lines, \\"Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost! A horse, A horse, My kingdom for a horse!\\" before being kicked out of the window by a Goofy Gophers-hauled horse. In the 1993 Mel Brooks film Robin Hood: Men in Tights, the character Robin of Locksley, played by Cary Elwes, says \\"A horse, my kingdom for a horse!\\" as he arrives in England in the opening scene. Other The film Being John Malkovich has many Shakespeare allusions, including a scene in which Malkovich is shown rehearsing Richard III lines \\"Was ever woman in this humour woo'd? / Was ever woman in this humour won?\\" where Richard is boasting about using power, lies, and crime to seduce Lady Anne. As Visual Cultures professor Lynn Turner notes, this scene anticipates a parallel scene in which Craig uses deceit to seduce Maxine through Malkovich.\\"Translating John Malkovich\\" by Lynn Turner originally published in Translations ‚Äì Performance Research 2002 ‚Äì Volume 7, No. 2, June Mariangela Tempera has noted that the subservience of Lady Anne in the scene contrasts with the self-assertiveness of the actress playing Lady Anne as she seduces Malkovich offstage. Essay: \\"Winter and Horses: References to Richard III on film and television\\" Adam Sandler's 2011 film Jack and Jill features Al Pacino reprising his role of Richard III, although the movie scenes are modified as Pacino interacts with the audience in a heavily comedic way. Multiple reviewers who panned the film regarded Pacino as the best element of the film.Just How Good Is Al Pacino In Jack and Jill In V for Vendetta when V confronts Father Lilliman, he quotes the line \\"And thus I clothe my naked villany in old odd ends stol'n forth of holy writ, and seem a saint when most I play the devil.\\" In Freaked, an arrogant movie star who has been transformed into a \\"hideous mutant freak\\" makes use of his deformity by performing the opening soliloquy, condensed by a local professor in subtitles for the \\"culturally illiterate\\" to the more succinct \\"I'm ugly. I never get laid.\\" One reviewer mentioned this as the best example of how the film seamlessly moves between highbrow and lowbrow culture.\\"WTF:Freaked\\" . Spectrum Culture In The Goodbye Girl, an ambitious actor played by Richard Dreyfuss is forced by his off-Broadway producer to play Richard III as a caricature of a homosexual. Elliot Garfield (Dreyfuss) describes his performance as \\"putrid\\". In the 1975 film L'important c'est d'aimer, directed by Andrzej ≈ªu≈Çawski, a production of Richard III in French is a mise en abyme for the drama enveloping the characters in the film. The manga Requiem of the Rose King by Aya Kanno, which began in 2013, is a loose adaptation of the first Shakespearean historical tetralogy. It depicts Richard III as intersex instead of hunchbacked. Historical inaccuracy Shakespeare, and the Tudor chroniclers who influenced him, had an interest in portraying the defeat of the Plantagenet House of York by the House of Tudor as good conquering evil. Loyalty to the new regime required that the last Plantagenet king, Richard III, be depicted as a villain. The historical inaccuracies in the play can be attributed partly to Shakespeare's sources, such as Holinshed's Chronicles, and partly to artistic licence. Some of these inaccuracies are listed below in the order in which they either appear or are referred to in the play. Richard was not personally responsible for the death of his wife's first husband, Edward of Westminster (the son of Henry VI), nor that of her father, the Earl of Warwick (and in Henry VI, Part 3 Richard is not portrayed as being responsible for Warwick's death). Edward of Westminster and Warwick were killed in the battles of Tewkesbury and Barnet, respectively. Richard, then eighteen, took part in both battles, but no contemporary records indicate him as being involved directly in either death. Shakespeare's sources do not identify Richard as being involved in the death of Henry VI, who was probably murdered on the orders of Edward IV.Wolffe, Bertram (1981). Henry VI. Richard and his wife, Anne Neville, had known each other for a long time before they married, having spent much of their childhood in the same household. Henry VI's widow, Queen Margaret, would not have been seen at court in the period covered by this play; she became Edward IV's prisoner and returned to France in 1475.Hartley, Cathy (2003). A Historical Dictionary of British Women. Richard's elder brother, Clarence (George, Duke of Clarence), was executed by Edward IV for treason in 1478, when Richard was in the North of England, where he continued to live until Edward IV died five years later. Richard returned from the North to fulfil Edward IV's wish that he rule as Lord Protector. It was the Plantagenet tradition that a future king (in this case Edward V, the elder of the \\"princes in the tower\\"), would stay in the royal apartments of the Tower of London while awaiting his coronation. No one knows why the \\"princes in the tower\\" disappeared or what happened to them. Richard took the throne by an Act of Parliament, on the basis of testimony claiming that Edward IV's marriage to Queen Elizabeth (Elizabeth Woodville) had been bigamous. Contemporary rumours that Richard had murdered his own wife appear baseless; she is thought to have died of tuberculosis. There is no surviving evidence to suggest that he planned to marry his niece, Elizabeth of York, although rumours about this plan did circulate. However, at the time he was also negotiating a marriage for Elizabeth with a Portuguese prince, Manuel, Duke of Beja (later Manuel I of Portugal).. At the Battle of Bosworth there was no single combat between Richard and Richmond (Henry Tudor), although it has been suggested that Richard had hoped for one. Richard spotted Richmond in his rearguard surrounded by French pikemen and led a cavalry charge against him. Richard was steered away from Richmond by Sir Rhys ap Thomas. The Stanleys (Thomas, Lord Stanley and his younger brother, Sir William Stanley) only entered the fray in support of Richmond when they saw that Richard was vulnerable; when he saw the Stanleys, Richard cried \\"Treason\\". Richard fell from his horse after it lost its footing in a marshy area; he was offered a new horse but declined. Now on foot, Richard was hacked to death. The only contemporary reference to Richard having any deformities was the observation that his right shoulder was slightly higher than his left, which is now known to have been caused by his scoliosis of the spine. After the discovery of Richard's remains in 2012 it became clear that, although he might have been slightly hunched, the degree and direction of the curvature was not as serious as that of a spinal kyphosis (or \\"hunchback\\"), and there were no other apparent deformities.

The silver band on the diodes indicates the cathode side of the diode. A diode bridge is an arrangement of four (or more) diodes in a bridge circuit configuration that provides the same polarity of output for either polarity of input. When used in its most common application, for conversion of an alternating-current (AC) input into a direct-current (DC) output, it is known as a bridge rectifier. A bridge rectifier provides full- wave rectification from a two-wire AC input, resulting in lower cost and weight as compared to a rectifier with a 3-wire input from a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding. The essential feature of a diode bridge is that the polarity of the output is the same regardless of the polarity at the input. The diode bridge circuit was invented by Polish electrotechnician Karol Pollak and patented in December 1895 in Great BritainBritish patent 24398. and in January 1896 in Germany(Graetz, 1897), p. 327 footnote.. In 1897, the German physicist Leo Graetz independently invented and published a similar circuit.See:  Strzelecki, R. Power Electronics in Smart Electrical Energy Networks. Springer, 2008, p. 57. Today the circuit is still referred to as a Graetz circuit or Graetz bridge. Prior to the availability of integrated circuits, a bridge rectifier was constructed from \\"discrete components\\", i.e., separate diodes. Since about 1950, a single four-terminal component containing the four diodes connected in a bridge configuration became a standard commercial component and is now available with various voltage and current ratings. Diodes are also used in bridge topologies along with capacitors as voltage multipliers. Current flow According to the conventional model of current flow (originally established by Benjamin Franklin and still followed by most engineers todayStutz, Michael (stutz@dsl.org), \\"Conventional versus electron flow\\", All About Circuits, Vol. 1, Chapter 1, 2000.), current flows through electrical conductors from the positive to the negative pole (defined as \\"positive flow\\"). In actuality, free electrons in a conductor nearly always flow from the negative to the positive pole. In the vast majority of applications, however, the actual direction of current flow is irrelevant. Therefore, in the discussion below the conventional model is retained. The fundamental characteristic of a diode is that current can flow only one way through it, which is defined as the forward direction. A diode bridge uses diodes as series components to allow current to pass in the forward direction during the positive part of the AC cycle and as shunt components to redirect current flowing in the reverse direction during the negative part of the AC cycle to the opposite rails. Rectifier In the diagrams below, when the input connected to the left corner of the diamond is positive, and the input connected to the right corner is negative, current flows from the upper supply terminal to the right along the red (positive) path to the output and returns to the lower supply terminal through the blue (negative) path.

Since this is true whether the input is AC or DC, this circuit not only produces a DC output from an AC input, it can also provide what is sometimes called \\"reverse-polarity protection\\". That is, it permits normal functioning of DC-powered equipment when batteries have been installed backwards, or when the leads (wires) from a DC power source have been reversed, and protects the equipment from potential damage caused by reverse polarity. Alternatives to the diode-bridge full-wave rectifiers are the center-tapped transformer and double-diode rectifier, and voltage doubler rectifier using two diodes and two capacitors in a bridge topology. half-wave and full-wave rectified signals\\"Rectifier\\", Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, Third Edition, Sybil P. Parker, ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1994, p. 1589. Smoothing circuits With AC input, the output of a diode bridge (called a full-wave rectifier for this purpose; there is also half-wave rectification, which does not use a diode bridge) is polarized pulsating non-sinusoidal voltage of the same amplitude but twice the frequency of the input. It may be considered as DC voltage upon which is superimposed a very large ripple voltage. This kind of electric power is not very usable, because ripple is dissipated as waste heat in DC circuit components and may cause noise or distortion during circuit operation. So nearly all rectifiers are followed by a series of bandpass or bandstop filters and/or a voltage regulator to convert most or all of the ripple voltage into a smoother and possibly higher DC output. A filter may be as simple as a single sufficiently large capacitor or choke, but most power-supply filters have multiple alternating series and shunt components. When the ripple voltage rises, reactive power is stored in the filter components, reducing the voltage; when the ripple voltage falls, reactive power is discharged from the filter components, raising the voltage. The final stage of rectification may consist of a zener diode-based voltage regulator, which almost completely eliminates any residual ripple. Snubber circuits Power-supply transformers have leakage inductance and parasitic capacitance. When the diodes in a bridge rectifier switch off, these \\"non-ideal\\" elements form a resonant circuit, which can oscillate at high frequency. This high-frequency oscillation can then couple into the rest of the circuitry. Snubber circuits are used in an attempt to mitigate this problem. A snubber circuit consists of either a very small capacitor or series capacitor and resistor across a diode. Polyphase diode bridges The diode bridge can be generalized to rectify polyphase AC inputs. For example, for a three-phase AC input, a half-wave rectifier consists of three diodes, but a full-wave bridge rectifier consists of six diodes. Half-wave rectifier may be considered as wye connection (star connection), because it returns the current through the centre (neutral) wire. Full-wave is more like delta connection, although it can be connected to the three-phase source of either wye or delta and it does not use the centre (neutral) wire.

In North America, it was published by Romstar. Controlling a paddle-like craft known as the Vaus, the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks, accomplished by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the playfield. Some blocks contain power-ups that have various effects on the player, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, creating several additional balls, or turning the Vaus into a laser cannon. Created by Taito designers Akira Fujita and Hiroshi Tsujino, Arkanoid was made to expand on the block breaker concept established in Atari's Breakout, a successful game in its own right that was met with a large wave of similar clone games from other manufacturers. It was part of a contest within Taito, where two teams of designers had to complete a block breaker game and determine which one was superior to the other. The film Tron served as inspiration for the game's futuristic, neon aesthetic. Level designs were first sketched out on paper before being programmed and tested to make sure they were fun to play. The enemy and power-up designs were 3D models converted into sprite art. Early location tests for Arkanoid proved to be successful and surpassed Taito's initial expectations. The game was commended by critics for its gameplay, simplicity, addictive nature and improvements over the original Breakout concept. The game helped revitalize the block-breaker genre and set the groundwork for many games to follow. Arkanoid was ported to many home video game platforms, including the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, ZX Spectrum and mobile phones, and it spawned a long series of sequels and updates over the course of two decades. Gameplay Arcade screenshot Arkanoid is a block breaker video game. Its plot involves the starship Arkanoid being attacked by a mysterious entity from space named DOH. A small paddle-shaped craft, the Vaus, is ejected from the ArkanoidIn Arkanoid, players maneuver a paddle-shaped craft named the Vaus along the bottom of the screen. The player controls the \\"Vaus\\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \\"paddle\\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, and attempts to bounce the ball against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player advances to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are game variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same. On the final stage (33 on most versions, but 36 on the NES), the player takes on the game's boss, \\"DOH\\", a head resembling moai. Once this point is reached, the player no longer has the option to continue after running out of lives, making this segment more difficult. The game is over regardless of the outcome. Development and release Arkanoid was designed by Akira Fujita and Hiroshi \\"ONIJIST\\" Tsujino, both of whom were members of Taito's Yokohama Research Institute. The company's sales department requested a new block breaker arcade game due to the genre beginning to see an upturn in popularity, following a steady downfall in the early 1980s. This led to a competition being held within the company to design the new game which was jointly won by Fujita and Tsujino, who were then instructed to combine their ideas into a single project. The game builds on the overall block breaker concept established in Atari's Breakout, a widely-successful arcade game that spawned a long series of similar clone games by other manufacturers. The development team consisted of Fujita in charge of planning, with Tsujino providing level design and graphics and two others programming the arcade board, a modified version of the Taito Classic hardware. The neon, futuristic aesthetic was inspired by the film Tron (1982), which Tsujino was a big fan of. Blocks originally never had colors and were simply the same color, which was changed to the minor annoyance of Tsujino. The various geometric-like enemies and power-up items were hand-drawn from 3-dimensional models before being converted into sprite art. Hisayoshi Ogura, the founder of Taito's \\"house band\\" Zuntata, created the game's music. The game had a short development time with tight work deadlines, a schedule which Tsujino has since claimed to be \\"murderous\\". Location testing for the game began only a month after the start of development. It was incredibly well-received by playtesters, and generated a lot more popularity and income than Taito had expected. Arkanoid was officially released in Japan in July 1986, and in North America later that year by distributor company Romstar. =Conversions= Arkanoid was ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, MSX, Atari 8-bit family, Apple II, NES, Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS and IBM PC. A Macintosh version was released in 1987 and a port was released for the Tandy Color Computer 3 in 1989. Computer conversions were published by Imagine. The NES port was packaged with a custom controller. Reception Arkanoid was a popular title in arcades, where it became one of Taito's most profitable coin-operated games. Game Machine listed it as being the most popular arcade game of August 1986 in Japan, while Euromax listed it as being the third most popular arcade game in Europe during 1987. Arkanoid and its home releases received several awards, including the \\"Silver Award\\" from Gamest,Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pp. 6-26 \\"Games of the Year\\" from Compute!,Arcade Action, Computer and Video Games, December 1987 and \\"Best Arcade Translation\\" from Computer Gaming World. In Europe, it was reviewed by Clare Edgeley in the December 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, where she compared it to Pong and Space Invaders in its simplicity and addictiveness. She described Arkanoid as \\"a lovely game\\" that is \\"Fast, colourful, simple and addictive.\\" The home versions were also well received. Computer Gaming World stated in 1988 that Arkanoid on the Amiga was \\"a perfect version of the arcade game ... incredible!\\" It named the NES version the Best Arcade Translation for the console that year, praising the graphics and play mechanics. The game was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #144 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Compute! named the game to its list of \\"nine great games for 1989\\", describing it as \\"hypnotic, addictive, and fascinating\\". Along with Breakout, the magazine noted Arkanoid also has elements of Pong and Space Invaders as well as Pac-Man in its use of power-ups. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly editors ranked the NES version the 41st best console video game of all time, describing it as \\"the type of game that you'd pick up because you need a quick video game fix but would end up playing for hours.\\" They particularly noted that despite the ability to shoot lasers, the game demanded a great deal of skill from the player. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Legacy Arkanoid was followed by a number of direct and indirect sequels. Tournament Arkanoid was released in 1987 exclusively in the United States by Romstar. Unlike the original game, it was developed by Taito America rather than Taito Japan. It is more of a mission-pack sequel than a true sequel, since it has the exact same gameplay as the original Arkanoid and only the levels are different. Revenge of Doh (Arkanoid 2) was released into arcades in 1987. Unlike Tournament Arkanoid, Revenge of Doh is a true sequel to the game with new gameplay mechanics. Arkanoid: Doh It Again and Arkanoid Returns were published in 1997, followed by Arkanoid DS in 2007,. An Xbox 360 version of Arkanoid was published as Arkanoid Live! on May 6, 2009 for Xbox Live Arcade.and ivexboxlivearcade/ Arkanoid Live! Game Detail Page , xbox.com A WiiWare version of Arkanoid, titled Arkanoid Plus!, was released in Japan on May 26, 2009, in PAL regions on August 21, 2009 and in North America on September 28, 2009. A version of Arkanoid for iOS was released in 2009. The mashup Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders was released in 2017 for iOS and Android.

The majority of studies on blindsight are conducted on patients who have the conscious blindness on only one side of their visual field. Following the destruction of the striate cortex, patients are asked to detect, localize, and discriminate amongst visual stimuli that are presented to their blind side, often in a forced-response or guessing situation, even though they do not consciously recognize the visual stimulus. Research shows that blind patients achieve a higher accuracy than would be expected from chance alone. Type 1 blindsight is the term given to this ability to guess‚Äîat levels significantly above chance‚Äîaspects of a visual stimulus (such as location or type of movement) without any conscious awareness of any stimuli. Type 2 blindsight occurs when patients claim to have a feeling that there has been a change within their blind area‚Äîe.g. movement‚Äîbut that it was not a visual percept. Blindsight challenges the common belief that perceptions must enter consciousness to affect our behavior; showing that our behavior can be guided by sensory information of which we have no conscious awareness. It may be thought of as a converse of the form of anosognosia known as Anton‚ÄìBabinski syndrome, in which there is full cortical blindness along with the confabulation of visual experience.  History  We owe much of our current understanding of blindsight to early experiments on monkeys. One monkey in particular, Helen, could be considered the \\"star monkey in visual research\\" because she was the original blindsight subject. Helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated; specifically, her primary visual cortex (V1) was completely removed, blinding her. Nevertheless, under certain specific situations, Helen exhibited sighted behavior. Her pupils would dilate and she would blink at stimuli that threatened her eyes. Furthermore, under certain experimental conditions, she could detect a variety of visual stimuli, such as the presence and location of objects, as well as shape, pattern, orientation, motion, and color. In many cases, she was able to navigate her environment and interact with objects as if she were sighted. A similar phenomenon was also discovered in humans. Subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness. In spite of this, when they were prompted they could \\"guess\\" with above-average accuracy about the presence and details of objects, much like the animal subjects, and they could even catch objects that were tossed at them. The subjects never developed any kind of confidence in their abilities. Even when told of their successes, they would not begin to spontaneously make \\"guesses\\" about objects, but instead still required prompting. Furthermore, blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express.  Describing blindsight  Patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception (the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements. The phenomenon shows how, after the more complex perception system is damaged, people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they cannot see what they are reaching for. Hence, visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation. This ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain, but is produced by specialised parts of it. Blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features, such as edges and motion, but cannot gain a holistic visual percept. This suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that‚Äîin sighted individuals‚Äîthere is a \\"binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept\\", which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia. Therefore, object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain, working independently from one another. The modular theory of object perception and integration would account for the \\"hidden perception\\" experienced in blindsight patients. Research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders, sharp onset/offset times, motion, and low spatial frequency contribute to, but are not strictly necessary for, an object's salience in blindsight.  Cause  There are three theories for the explanation of blindsight. The first states that after damage to area V1, other branches of the optic nerve deliver visual information to the superior colliculus and several other areas, including parts of the cerebral cortex. In turn, these areas might then control the blindsight responses. Another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person's visual cortex may be damaged, tiny islands of functioning tissue remain. These islands aren't large enough to provide conscious perception, but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception. A third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the lateral geniculate nucleus before the information is projected to the visual cortex. In a normal subject, these signals are used to merge the information from the eyes into a three-dimensional representation (which includes the position and velocity of individual objects relative to the organism), extract a vergence signal to benefit the precision (previously auxiliary) optical system, and extract a focus control signal for the lenses of the eyes. The stereoscopic information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex.Fulton, J. (2004) Processes in Biological Vision Section 7.4 Evidence of blindsight can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months, although there is difficulty in determining the type in a patient who is not old enough to answer questions.  Evidence in animals  In a 1995 experiment, researchers attempted to show that monkeys with lesions in or even wholly removed striate cortexes also experienced blindsight. To study this, they had the monkeys complete tasks similar to those commonly used on human subjects. The monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to indicate whether a stationary object or nothing was present in their visual field when a tone was played. Then the monkeys performed the same task except the stationary objects were presented outside of their visual field. The monkeys performed very similar to human participants and were unable to perceive the presence of stationary objects outside of their visual field. Another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there. To do this, researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field. Starting from the center of the deficit visual field, the object would either move up, down, or to the right. The monkeys performed identically to humans on the test, getting them right almost every time. This showed that the monkey's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field, and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder. Several years later, another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight, GY. GY's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight, though for the most part he retained full functionality, GY was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field. In the monkeys, the striate cortex of the left hemisphere was surgically removed. By comparing the test results of both GY and the monkeys, the researchers concluded that similar patterns of responses to stimuli in the \\"blind\\" visual field can be found in both species.  Research  Lawrence Weiskrantz and colleagues showed in the early 1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field, some observers do better than chance. This ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus (for example, whether an 'X' or 'O' has been presented in the blind field). Electrophysiological evidence from the late 1970s has shown that there is no direct retinal input from S-cones to the superior colliculus, implying that the perception of color information should be impaired. However, more recent evidence point to a pathway from S-cones to the superior colliculus, opposing previous research and supporting the idea that some chromatic processing mechanisms are intact in blindsight. Patients shown images on their blind side of people expressing emotions correctly guessed the emotion most of the time. The movement of facial muscles used in smiling and frowning were measured and reacted in ways that matched the kind of emotion in the unseen image. Therefore, the emotions were recognized without involving conscious sight. A 2011 study found that a young woman with a unilateral lesion of area V1 could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field, even though she could not report the sizes of the objects. Similarly, another patient with unilateral lesion of area V1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field. Even though he avoided the obstacles, he never reported seeing them. A study reported in 2008 asked patient GY to misstate where in his visual field a distinctive stimulus was presented. If the stimulus was in the upper part of his visual field, he was to say it was in the lower part, and vice versa. He was able to misstate, as requested, in his left visual field (with normal conscious vision); but he tended to fail in the task‚Äîto state the location correctly‚Äîwhen the stimulus was in his blindsight (right) visual field. This failure rate worsened when the stimulus was clearer, indicating that failure was not simply due to unreliability of blindsight. = Case studies= Researchers applied the same type of tests that were used to study blindsight in animals to a patient referred to as DB. The normal techniques that were used to assess visual acuity in humans involved asking them to verbally describe some visually recognizable aspect of an object or objects. DB was given forced-choice tasks to complete instead. The results of DB's guesses showed that DB was able to determine shape and detect movement at some unconscious level, despite not being visually aware of this. DB themselves chalked up the accuracy of their guesses to be merely coincidental. The discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information, even unconscious information, may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex. Previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field, shape, orientation and movement. But, in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged. Blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information. So even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information, other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual. The same also goes for damage to other areas of the visual cortex. If an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged, it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect, functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact. Alexander and Cowey investigated how contrasting brightness of stimuli affects blindsight patients' ability to discern movement. Prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields. The subjects of the study were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia‚Äîblindness in more than half of their visual field. Both of the subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously. To test the effect of brightness on the subject's ability to determine motion they used a white background with a series of colored dots. They would alter the contrast of the brightness of the dots compared to the white background in each different trial to see if the participants performed better or worse when there was a larger discrepancy in brightness or not. Their procedure was to have the participants face the display for a period of time and ask them to tell the researchers when the dots were moving. The subjects focused on the display through two equal length time intervals. They would tell the researchers whether they thought the dots were moving during the first or the second time interval. When the contrast in brightness between the background and the dots was higher, both of the subjects could discern motion more accurately than they would have statistically by just guessing. However one of the subjects was not able to accurately determine whether or not blue dots were moving regardless of the brightness contrast, but he/she was able to do so with every other color dot. When the contrast was highest the subjects were able to tell whether or not the dots were moving with very high rates of accuracy. Even when the dots were white, but still of a different brightness from the background, the subjects could still determine if they were moving or not. But, regardless of the dots' color the subjects could not tell when they were in motion or not when the white background and the dots were of similar brightness. Kentridge, Heywood, and Weiskrantz used the phenomenon of blindsight to investigate the connection between visual attention and visual awareness. They wanted to see if their subject‚Äîwho exhibited blindsight in other studies‚Äîcould react more quickly when his/her attention was cued without the ability to be visually aware of it. The researchers wanted to show that being conscious of a stimulus and paying attention to it was not the same thing. To test the relationship between attention and awareness, they had the participant try to determine where a target was and whether it was oriented horizontally or vertically on a computer screen. The target line would appear at one of two different locations and would be oriented in one of two directions. Before the target would appear an arrow would become visible on the screen and sometimes it would point to the correct position of the target line and less frequently it would not, this arrow was the cue for the subject. The participant would press a key to indicate whether the line was horizontal or vertical, and could then also indicate to an observer whether or not he/she actually had a feeling that any object was there or not‚Äîeven if they couldn't see anything. The participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target, even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field. The study showed that even without the ability to be visually aware of a stimulus the participant could still focus his/her attention on this object. In 2003, a patient known as TN lost use of his primary visual cortex, area V1. He had two successive strokes, which knocked out the region in both his left and right hemispheres. After his strokes, ordinary tests of TN's sight turned up nothing. He could not even detect large objects moving right in front of his eyes. Researchers eventually began to notice that TN exhibited signs of blindsight and in 2008 decided to test their theory. They took TN into a hallway and asked him to walk through it without using the cane he always carried after having the strokes. TN was not aware at the time, but the researchers had placed various obstacles in the hallway to test if he could avoid them without conscious use of his sight. To the researchers' delight, he moved around every obstacle with ease, at one point even pressing himself up against the wall to squeeze past a trashcan placed in his way. After navigating through the hallway, TN reported that he was just walking the way he wanted to, not because he knew anything was there. In another case study, a girl had brought her grandfather in to see a neuropsychologist. The girl's grandfather, Mr. J., had had a stroke which had left him completely blind apart from a tiny spot in the middle of his visual field. The neuropsychologist, Dr. M., performed an exercise with him. The doctor helped Mr. J. to a chair, had him sit down, and then asked to borrow his cane. The doctor then asked, \\"Mr. J., please look straight ahead. Keep looking that way, and don't move your eyes or turn your head. I know that you can see a little bit straight ahead of you, and I don't want you to use that piece of vision for what I'm going to ask you to do. Fine. Now, I'd like you to reach out with your right hand [and] point to what I'm holding.\\" Mr. J. then replied, \\"But I don't see anything‚ÄîI'm blind!\\" The doctor then said, \\"I know, but please try, anyway.\\" Mr. J then shrugged and pointed, and was surprised when his finger encountered the end of the cane which the doctor was pointing toward him. After this, Mr. J. said that \\"it was just luck\\". The doctor then turned the cane around so that the handle side was pointing towards Mr. J. He then asked for Mr. J. to grab hold of the cane. Mr. J. reached out with an open hand and grabbed hold of the cane. After this, the doctor said, \\"Good. Now put your hand down, please.\\" The doctor then rotated the cane 90 degrees, so that the handle was oriented vertically. The doctor then asked Mr. J. to reach for the cane again. Mr. J. did this, and he turned his wrist so that his hand matched the orientation of the handle. This case study shows that‚Äîalthough (on a conscious level) Mr. J. was completely unaware of any visual abilities that he may have had‚Äîhe was able to orient his grabbing motions as if he had no visual impairments.  Brain regions involved  Visual processing in the brain goes through a series of stages. Destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation. The area of blindness ‚Äì known as a scotoma ‚Äì is in the visual field opposite the damaged hemisphere and can vary from a small area up to the entire hemifield. Visual processing occurs in the brain in a hierarchical series of stages (with much crosstalk and feedback between areas). The route from the retina through V1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex, though it is by far the largest; it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass V1. What is surprising is that activity in these extrastriate areas is apparently insufficient to support visual awareness in the absence of V1. To put it in a more complex way, recent physiological findings suggest that visual processing takes place along several independent, parallel pathways. One system processes information about shape, one about color, and one about movement, location and spatial organization. This information moves through an area of the brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus, located in the thalamus, and on to be processed in the primary visual cortex, area V1 (also known as the striate cortex because of its striped appearance). People with damage to V1 report no conscious vision, no visual imagery, and no visual images in their dreams. However, some of these people still experience the blindsight phenomenon, though this too is controversial, with some studies showing a limited amount of consciousness without V1 or projections relating to it. The superior colliculus and prefrontal cortex also have a major role in awareness of a visual stimulus. = Lateral geniculate nucleus = Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions defines the LGN as \\"one of two elevations of the lateral posterior thalamus receiving visual impulses from the retina via the optic nerves and tracts and relaying the impulses to the calcarine (visual) cortex\\". What is seen in the left and right visual field is taken in by each eye and brought back to the optic disc via the nerve fibres of the retina. From the optic disc, visual information travels through the optic nerve and into the optic chiasm. Visual information then enters the optic tract and travels to four different areas of the brain including the superior colliculus, pretectum of the mid brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Most axons from the LGN will then travel to the primary visual cortex. Injury to the primary visual cortex, including lesions and other trauma, leads to the loss of visual experience. However, the residual vision that is left cannot be attributed to V1. According to Schmid et al., \\"thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information\\". This information was found through experiments using fMRI during activation and inactivation of the LGN and the contribution the LGN has on visual experience in monkeys with a V1 lesion. These researchers concluded that the magnocellular system of the LGN is less affected by the removal of V1, which suggests that it is because of this system in the LGN that blindsight occurs. Furthermore, once the LGN was inactivated, virtually all of the extrastriate areas of the brain no longer showed a response on the fMRI. The information leads to a qualitative assessment that included \\"scotoma stimulation, with the LGN intact had fMRI activation of ~20% of that under normal conditions\\". This finding agrees with the information obtained from, and fMRI images of, patients with blindsight. The same study also supported the conclusion that the LGN plays a substantial role in blindsight. Specifically, while injury to V1 does create a loss of vision, the LGN is less affected and may result in the residual vision that remains, causing the \\"sight\\" in blindsight. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was has also been employed to conduct brain scans in normal, healthy human volunteers to attempt to demonstrate that visual motion can bypass V1, through a connection from the LGN to the human middle temporal complex. Their findings concluded that there was an indeed a connection of visual motion information that went directly from the LGN to the hMT+ bypassing V1 completely. Evidence also suggests that, following a traumatic injury to V1, there is still a direct pathway from the retina through the LGN to the extrastriate visual areas. The extrastriate visual areas include parts of the occipital lobe that surround V1. In non-human primates, these often include V2, V3, and V4. In a study conducted in primates, after partial ablation of area V1, areas V2 and V3 were still excited by visual stimulus. Other evidence suggests that \\"the LGN projections that survive V1 removal are relatively sparse in density, but are nevertheless widespread and probably encompass all extrastriate visual areas,\\" including V2, V4, V5 and the inferotemporal cortex region.

His birth certificate and his Social Security application both use the birthdate of February 7, 1908. See Age fabrication. He won the 1932 Olympic gold medal for 400-meter freestyle swimming event, which launched his career on the silver screen and later television. He starred in a variety of popular feature films and movie serials released between 1933 and the 1950s, portraying the top three syndicated comic-strip heroes of the 1930s: Tarzan, Flash Gordon, and Buck Rogers. Early life Crabbe was born in 1908 to Edward Clinton Simmons Crabbe, a real estate broker, and Lucy Agnes (n√©e McNamara) Crabbe, in Oakland, California. He had a brother, Edward Clinton Simmons Crabbe Jr. (1909‚Äì1972). Crabbe grew up in Hawaii and graduated from Punahou School in Honolulu. He then attended the University of Southern California, where he was the school's first All-American swimmer (1931) and a 1931 NCAA freestyle titlist. He also became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity before graduating from USC in 1931. Olympic Games Crabbe at age 20 at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam Crabbe competed in two Olympic Games as a swimmer. At the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, he won the bronze medal for the 1,500 meters freestyle, and at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he won the gold medal for the 400 meters freestyle when he beat Jean Taris of France by a tenth of a second. Acting career =Hollywood= King of the Jungle, eating lunch in a Hollywood restaurant in 1933. Crabbe became a lion tamer while working on that adventure film. He is credited in some films as \\"Larry Crabbe\\" or \\"Larry (Buster) Crabbe\\". His role in the Tarzan serial Tarzan the Fearless (1933) began a career in which Crabbe starred in more than a hundred films. In King of the Jungle (1933), Jungle Man (1941), and the serial King of the Congo (1952), he played typical \\"jungle man\\" roles. He starred in several popular films at this time, including The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi (1933), alongside Betty Grable, and Search for Beauty (1934). In 1936, he was selected over several stars to play Flash Gordon in the first, very successful Universal Pictures Flash Gordon serial, which was followed by two sequels released in 1938 and 1940. The series was later edited and shown extensively on American television during the 1950s and 1960s, then fully restored for home video release. He also starred as Buck Rogers for Universal, playing the role with dark hair, unlike his blonde hair for Flash Gordon. In 1939 Crabbe reunited with Grable for a lead role in the mainstream comedy Million Dollar Legs. Crabbe starred at the Billy Rose's Aquacade at the New York World's Fair during its second year (1940), replacing fellow Olympic swimmer and Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller. During World War II, Crabbe was put under contract by Producers Releasing Corporation for lead roles from 1942 to 1946. He portrayed a Western folk-hero version of Billy the Kid in 13 films, and Billy Carson in 23, along with Al St. John as his sidekick. As a 34-year-old married man, Crabbe had a draft deferment, but made Army training films for the field artillery at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, along with St. John.pp 31-32 Vermilye, Jerry Buster Crabbe: A Biofilmography McFarland, 29 Apr 2014 Crabbe also played some jungle roles for the studio. Following the war, Crabbe appeared opposite Weissmuller as a rival in two jungle films, Swamp Fire (1946) and Captive Girl (1950). For his final multi-chapter movie serial, Crabbe returned to the jungle playing the role of Thun'da in King of the Congo (1952). =Television= Buster Crabbe with real life son Cullen on Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion, ca. 1955 Crabbe starred in the syndicated television series, Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion (1955 to 1957) as Captain Michael Gallant; the adventure series aired on NBC. His real-life son, Cullen Crabbe, appeared in the series as the character \\"Cuffy Sanders\\". Crabbe was frequently featured in archival footage in the children's television program, The Gabby Hayes Show. Prior to his playing \\"Captain Gallant\\", Crabbe had hosted the local New York City-based children's film wraparound television series, The Buster Crabbe Show. It was set against the backdrop of a ranch foreman's bunk house and featured Crabbe engaging his viewers with games, stories, craftmaking, hobbies, informational segments, and interviews with guest performers and personalities. This was in-between the reruns of old movie serials, westerns, and comedies. The Buster Crabbe Show was seen weekday evenings on WOR-TV (Channel 9) in New York City from Monday, March 12, 1951, to Friday, October 3, 1952. The series name was changed to Buster's Buddies! and returned to the NYC airways on WJZ-TV (Channel 7) (now WABC) on Monday, September 21, 1953. The WJZ TV version of the series included a studio audience of kids, becoming more of a kids' variety show. Despite the addition of the studio audience and Crabbe's personality, Buster's Buddies! was not a hit, and it was canceled on Friday, March 26, 1954.Info about Crabbe hosting The Buster Crabbe Show/Buster's Buddies can be found in \\"The NYC Kids Shows Round Up\\" section of TVParty.Com and in Children's Television: The First Thirty Five Years: Live, Taped And Filmed Shows by George Woolery, Scarecrow Press, Inc. Crabbe made regular television appearances, including an episode of the 1979 series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, in which he played a retired fighter pilot named \\"Brigadier Gordon\\", in honor of Flash Gordon. When Rogers (Gil Gerard) praises his flying, Gordon replies \\"I've been doing that sort of thing since before you were born\\", not realizing Buck was actually born over 500 years earlier. (Indeed, Crabbe first played Flash Gordon in 1936, seven years before Gerard's birth.) Rogers responds \\"You think so?\\" to which Gordon replies \\"Young man, I know so!\\" He was also in a TV spot for Continental Airlines, where Crabbe spies himself in an old Flash Gordon short being shown on board: \\"I think I know that guy. He used to be my idol.\\" Later years Crabbe's Hollywood career waned somewhat in the 1950s and 1960s, and he became a stockbroker and businessman during this period. According to David Ragan's Movie Stars of the '30s, Crabbe owned a Southern California swimming pool-building company in later years. In the mid-1950s, Crabbe purchased the Adirondack campus of the Adirondack-Florida School, which advertised itself as a swim camp, called Camp Meenahga, for boys aged eight to fourteen, with most of the campers coming from Montreal. During this period, Buster joined the swimming pool company Cascade Industries in Edison, New Jersey. In his capacity as Vice President of Sales, promoter, and spokesman for Cascade, \\"the world's first 'package pool' company\\", he attended shopping mall openings and fairgrounds, combining the promotion of his swim camps and Cascade's vinyl liner for in-ground swimming pools. A pool line was named after him, and swimming pools were sold by \\"Buster Crabbe Dealers\\" throughout the eastern seaboard and southern states from 1952 until 1990. Though he followed other pursuits, he never stopped acting. However, his career in the 1950s, and later, was limited to low-budget films, notably westerns, such as Gunfighters of Abilene (1960), Arizona Raiders (1965), and The Bounty Killer (1965). He appeared as the father of a young swimmer in the comedy Swim Team (1979) and as a sheriff in the horror film Alien Dead (1980), followed by The Comeback Trail (1982), one year before his death. Crabbe also appeared in television commercials for Hormel Chili, Icy Hot, and the Magic Mold Bodyshirt, an upper body male girdle of sorts, which purportedly helped in weight loss. Through Icy Hot, he was actively involved in arthritis education. Despite his numerous film and television appearances, he is best remembered today as one of the original cinema action heroes of the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1950s, two published comic book series were named after him. Eastern Color published 12 issues of Buster Crabbe Comics from 1951 to 1953, followed by Lev Gleason's four issues of The Amazing Adventures of Buster Crabbe in 1954. In 1965, he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. During his senior swimming career, Crabbe set 16 world and 35 national records. He continued swimming through his sixties and in 1971 set a world record in his age group. Personal life In 1933, he married Adah Virginia Held (1912‚Äì2004) and gave himself a year to make it as an actor. If he didn't, he would start law school at USC. Crabbe and his wife had two daughters, Sande and Susan, and a son, Cullen. In 1957, Sande died of anorexia nervosa aged 20. He is the maternal grandfather of the college football coach Nick Holt. Death In 1983, at age 75, Crabbe died of a heart attack at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona. He is interred at Green Acres Memorial Park in Scottsdale.

The show was produced by Steve Vizard, who was also the executive producer, writer and performer, and starred Jane Turner, Gina Riley, Magda Szubanski (the three of whom went on to star in Kath & Kim), Marg Downey, Michael Veitch, Peter Moon, Alan Pentland, Steve Blackburn, Geoff Brooks, Ernie Dingo, the Rubbery Figures satirical puppets, and numerous guests and supporting stars, such as Gerry Connolly and Bryan Dawe.The Unofficial Fast Forward Guide Fast Forward was succeeded by the related series Full Frontal, and subsequently Totally Full Frontal, which were broadcast from 1993 to 1999. Full Frontal had a different main cast, but many of the Fast Forward cast guest starred. Fast Forward was directed by Ted Emery. From its second series onward, Andrew Knight joined Steve Vizard and Ted Emery as executive producers of the show. They went on to establish the leading Australian production house, Artist Services. All four seasons plus five 'best of' compilations of Fast Forward have been released on DVD. All four seasons were re-released in 2010. In 2013, the Network Ten-owned channel, One, began airing half-hour-long specials titled Fast Forward Funniest Send- Ups which first aired in 1994, making it the first time the show has been shown since 1998. Background Many of the stars came from a 1985 Seven Network sketch comedy pilot called The Eleventh Hour, which also spawned The Comedy Company, via The D-Generation. Fast Forward was commissioned by Seven in late 1988. It was produced by Vizard's production company, United Film Completion, and broadcast on Seven Network. There were a number of working titles for the show, including Snapped Cable Television, as well as Fast Forward. Style Fast Forward was noted for its fast-paced satirical comedy which particularly lampooned the media, in particular film and TV, with its parodies of well-known television shows (such as Kung Fu, Lost In Space, The Munsters, and A Current Affair), personalities (such as Clive James, Jana Wendt, Derryn Hinch and Geoffrey Robertson) and commercials (such as for American Express and Nescaf√©). Its subjects were also Australian politics, which it attacked through various political impersonations (including John Howard and Paul Keating), and also using the political puppets, Rubbery Figures, previously seen in small segments on the ABC, based on Peter Nicholson's political cartoons. Another key distinguishing feature was the use of simulated channel surfing to switch from sketch to sketch, often in the middle of a sketch, sometimes after the punchline. Particularly a sketch would abruptly switch to a momentary segment of static, followed by another sketch, simulating the effect of the viewer repeatedly switching channels. The channel-surfing device became a distinctive hallmark of the show that helped move quickly from sketch to sketch. The television and multimedia subject matter of the sketches, pace, style and devices were real points of difference from predecessor sketch comedy shows of the time, particularly earlier shows such as The Mavis Bramston Show, The Naked Vicar Show, Australia You're Standing In It, The D-Generation and The Comedy Company, Fast Forward was more media-focused and parody-focused; a real difference, and the binding force for the whole show, was the now-famous channel-changing device. The white noise and on-screen static that represented the channel change became the modern television equivalent of a curtain being drawn at an old-fashioned vaudeville show. Fast Forward was also well known for its musical parodies, particularly of current music video clips. Some of the better-known music parodies included ABBA, Cher and Dannii Minogue. Sketches and content Each episode of Fast Forward featured regular characters, a news-based segment, a major parody of a well-known television show or film, lampoons of television commercials, political satire, particularly in a segment using the Rubbery Figures political puppets. Some of the most memorable regular characters included ‚Ä¢ Marg Downey: SBS Presenter ‚Ä¢ Magda Szubanski: Pixie-Ann Wheatley; Chenille the Beautician (with Marg Downey as Janelle); the Ugly Couple (with Peter Moon) ‚Ä¢ Steve Vizard and Peter Moon: Advertising executives, Brent Smythe and Barry; Indian Rug Fakari salesmen Roger Ramshet and Abdul ‚Ä¢ Michael Veitch: gay flight attendants (with Steve Vizard); Kelvin Cunnington; Redmond Herring ‚Ä¢ Gerry Connolly: the Queen; Joh Bjelke-Petersen ‚Ä¢ Jane Turner: Russian news presenter Sveter (with Peter Moon as Victor) ‚Ä¢ Steve Vizard: Darren Hunch (parody of Derryn Hinch) ‚Ä¢ Ernie Dingo: Robert Gottliebsen ‚Ä¢ Steve Blackburn and Geoff Brooks: Arthur and Wayne Dodgy (dodgy salesmen who previously appeared in Australia You're Standing In It) ‚Ä¢ Michael Veitch and Glenn Robbins: The Whizz Bang Theatre Company Some of the most memorable sketches included \\"Dumb Street\\", a parody of Home and Away and Neighbours; and a lampoon of Skippy. In one memorable sketch that went to air, Moon and Vizard were both visibly trying to contain their laughter through a series of insults in one of their parodies of Kung Fu.Fast Forward - Kung Fu Parody The political puppets Rubbery Figures were made more \\"commercial\\" than on the ABC by inserting them into popular situations outside the political Canberra environment. This led to the Star Trek parody where Paul Keating was Mr. Spock and Bob Hawke was Captain Kirk. Rubbery Figures was a huge hit and a crucial element in the early success of Fast Forward. In 1991, there were five Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends skits featuring Ertl Thomas models. These segments involved people complaining about Sodor not having female steam engines, the Fat Controller polluting the countryside by pouring purple slime out of the tankers, drunken punks, the engines going on strike, and the engines getting replaced. In these skits, Thomas would do some human things, such as eating breakfast, writing, and going away for the weekend. Percy was referred to as Bertie two times in the first sketch, Gordon at the end of the fourth, and Henry one time in the fifth. The sketches had five original engine characters, Crazy Bartholomew the Loco Locomotive, who was a Thomas model painted yellow, Alfred, who was a Percy model painted red (he was even referred to as Percy at the start of the fifth sketch), Damian the Diesel, who isn't seen in person, Edgar, who is a mentioned engine character, and one of the female engines, who was a Percy model painted orange with additional detailing. Toby was also mentioned once at the end of the first sketch, and so was Clarabel once in the fourth sketch.

In 1990, Fast Forward won two Logie awards; it also received two Australian Television awards (Penguins) for Excellence in Make-up and Achievement in Production. Also in 1990, the company was bestowed with two AWGIES, the Australian Writers' Guild Awards; one for Fast Forward for best Comedy/Revue/Sketch and the other for Vizard, Co-writer Best Sketch Comedy ‚Äì Fast Forward. The Variety Club awarded Vizard Comedy Artist Of The Year and Rolling Stone magazine awarded him Television Performer of the Year. At the ARIA Awards Fast Forward picked up Best Comedy Record. At the 1991 Logie Awards Steve Vizard won the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television. Vizard also won Most Popular Male Light Entertainer. Magda Szubanski won Most Popular Female Light Entertainer and Fast Forward was awarded Most Popular Light Entertainment Program. Also in 1991, the Fast Forward writing team won an AWGIE for Best Sketch Comedy for Fast Forward. At the 1992 Logies, Magda Szubanski once again picked up the award for Most Popular Female Performer ‚Äì Light Entertainment and Fast Forward received the Logie for Most Popular Light Entertainment Program. The Australian Writers Guild presented an AWGIE to Fast Forward for Best Sketch Comedy. Fast Forward also picked up a People's Choice Award for Most Popular Program on Australian Television. The following year, 1993, Fast Forward won a Logie for Most Popular Comedy Program. The production team and cast decided in late 1992, despite offers to renew from Channel 7, to end the program 'on a high', feeling that they did not want it to go downhill and tarnish its legacy as one of Australia's best-ever sketch comedy shows.

P. Lovecraft. Written in the summer of 1926, it was first published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales in February 1928. Inspiration The first seed of the story's first chapter The Horror in Clay came from one of Lovecraft's own dreams he had in 1919, which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend Rheinhart Kleiner on May 21 and December 14, 1920. In the dream, Lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in Providence, attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief Lovecraft himself had sculpted, who initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something recently made to a museum of antique objects. Lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator with the response :\\"Why do you say that this thing is new? The dreams of men are older than brooding Egypt or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon, and this was fashioned in my dreams.\\" This can be compared to what the character of Henry Anthony Wilcox tells the main character's uncle while showing him his sculpted bas-relief for help in reading hieroglyphs on it which came through Wilcox's own fantastical dreams: :\\"It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.\\" Lovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own Commonplace Book at first in August 1925, which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted. In a footnote for his writing down of his own dream, Lovecraft then finished with the suggestion \\"Add good development & describe nature of bas-relief\\" to himself for future reference. Cthulhu Mythos scholar Robert M. Price claims the irregular sonnet \\"The Kraken\\",The Kraken, The Victorian Web written in 1830 by Alfred Tennyson, was a major inspiration for Lovecraft's story, as both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age.Robert M. Price, \\"The Other Name of Azathoth\\", introduction to The Cthulhu Cycle. Price credits Philip A. Shreffler with connecting the poem and the story. S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz cited other literary inspirations: Guy de Maupassant's \\"The Horla\\" (1887), which Lovecraft described in Supernatural Horror in Literature as concerning \\"an invisible being who...sways the minds of others, and seems to be the vanguard of a horde of extraterrestrial organisms arrived on Earth to subjugate and overwhelm mankind\\"; and Arthur Machen's \\"The Novel of the Black Seal\\" (1895), which uses the same method of piecing together of disassociated knowledge (including a random newspaper clipping) to reveal the survival of a horrific ancient being.S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, \\"Call of Cthulhu, The\\", An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia, pp. 28‚Äì29. It is also assumed he got inspiration from William Scott-Elliot's The Story of Atlantis (1896) and The Lost Lemuria (1904), which Lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story.H.P. Lovecraft, Fortean Times magazine Price also notes that Lovecraft admired the work of Lord Dunsany, who wrote The Gods of Pegana (1905), which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening. Another Dunsany work cited by Price is A Shop in Go-by Street (1919), which stated \\"the heaven of the gods who sleep\\", and \\"unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber\\".Price, \\"The Other Name of Azathoth\\". This passage is also believed to have inspired Lovecraft's entity Azathoth, hence the title of Price's essay. The \\"slight earthquake\\" mentioned in the story is likely the 1925 Charlevoix‚ÄìKamouraska earthquake. S.T. Joshi has also cited A. Merritt's novella The Moon Pool (1918) which Lovecraft 'frequently rhapsodied about'. Joshi says that, 'Merritt's mention of a \\"moon-door\\" that, when tilted, leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes Cthulhu to emerge from R'lyeh'.Joshi, S.T. (2010) I am Providence: The Life and Times of H.P. Lovecraft. New York: Hippocampus Press. 2 Vols. Vol II pg. 639 Edward Guimont has argued that H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds was an influence on \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", citing the thematic similarities of ancient, powerful, but indifferent aliens associated with deities; physical similarities between Cthulhu and the Martians; and the plot detail of a ship ramming an alien in a temporarily successful but ultimately futile gesture. Plot summary The story's narrator, Francis Wayland Thurston, recounts his discovery of various notes left behind by his great uncle, George Gammell Angell, a prominent professor of Semitic languages at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who died during the winter of 1926 after being jostled by a sailor. The first chapter, \\"The Horror in Clay\\", concerns a small bas-relief sculpture found among the notes, which the narrator describes: \\"My somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature. ... A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings.‚Äù The sculpture is the work of Henry Anthony Wilcox, a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, who based his creation on a delirious dream of \\"great Cyclopean cities of titanic blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror.‚Äù References to both Cthulhu and R'lyeh are included in letters written by Wilcox.Lovecraft has stated Wilcox's residence in his story is actually the Fleur-de-Lys Studios in Providence. Angell also discovers reports of \\"outre mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania\\" around the world (in New York City, \\"hysterical Levantines\\" mob police; in California, a Theosophist colony dress in white robes while awaiting a \\"glorious fulfillment\\"). The second chapter, \\"The Tale of Inspector Legrasse\\", discusses the first time the Professor had heard the word \\"Cthulhu\\" and seen a similar image. At the 1908 meeting of the American Archaeological Society in St. Louis, Missouri, a New Orleans police official named John Raymond Legrasse asked the assembled antiquarians to identify an idol carved from a mysterious greenish-black stone. Legrasse had discovered the relic months before in the swamps south of New Orleans, during his raid on a supposed voodoo cult. The idol resembles Wilcox's sculpture, and represented a \\"thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters.‚Äù On November 1, 1907, Legrasse led a party of fellow policemen in search of several women and children who disappeared from a squatter community. The police found the victims' \\"oddly marred\\" bodies being used in a ritual where 100 men‚Äîall of a \\"mentally aberrant type\\"‚Äîwere \\"braying, bellowing, and writhing\\" and repeatedly chanting the phrase: \\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn\\". After killing five of the participants and arresting 47 others, Legrasse interrogated the men before learning \\"the central idea of their loathsome faith\\": > \\"They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before > there were any men ... and ... formed a cult which had never died ... hidden > in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the > great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under > the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day > he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always > be waiting to liberate him.\\"Lovecraft, \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", p. 139. The prisoners identify the confiscated idol as Cthulhu himself, and translate their mysterious phrase as \\"In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\\" One particularly talkative cultist, known as Old Castro, named the center of their cult as Irem, the City of Pillars in Arabia, and referred to a phrase in the Necronomicon: \\"That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die.‚Äù One of the academics present at the meeting, William Channing Webb, a professor of anthropology at Princeton, states that during an 1860 expedition to the western coast of Greenland, he encountered \\"a singular tribe of degenerate Eskimos whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness\\". Webb claims the Greenland cult possessed both the same chant and a similar \\"hideous\\" fetish. Thurston, the narrator, reflects that \\"My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were.‚Äù In the third chapter, \\"The Madness from the Sea\\", Thurston reads an article dated April 18, 1925, from the Sydney Bulletin, an Australian newspaper. The article reports the discovery of a derelict ship in the Pacific Ocean with only one survivor‚Äîa Norwegian sailor named Gustaf Johansen, second mate on board the Emma, a schooner which originally sailed from Auckland, New Zealand. On March 22, the Emma encountered a heavily armed yacht, the Alert, crewed by \\"a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes\\" from Dunedin. After being attacked by the Alert without provocation, the crew of the Emma killed everyone aboard, but lost their own ship in the battle. Commandeering their opponent's vessel, the surviving crewmembers travel on and arrive at an uncharted island in the vicinity of . With the exception of Johansen and a fellow sailor (who then died as they made their way back to Auckland, New Zealand due to madness from seeing whatever was on that uncharted island), the remaining crewmembers perish on the island. Johansen never reveals the cause of their death. Thurston travels to New Zealand and then Australia, where at the Australian Museum he views a statue retrieved from the Alert with a \\"cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal\\". While in Oslo, Thurston learns that Johansen died suddenly during an encounter with two Lascars near the Gothenburg docks. Johansen's widow provides Thurston with a manuscript written by her late husband, which reveals the fate of everyone aboard the Emma. The uncharted island is described as \\"a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror‚Äîthe nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh\\". The crew struggle in comprehending the non-Euclidean geometry of their surroundings. When one of the sailors accidentally opens a \\"monstrously carven portal\\", he releases Cthulhu: > \\"It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous > green immensity through the black doorway. ... The stars were right again, > and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent > sailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years, Great Cthulhu > was loose again and ravening for delight.\\" Before fleeing with his crewmembers, almost all of whom are killed, Johansen describes Cthulhu as \\"a mountain [that] walked or stumbled\\". Johansen and a sailor named Briden climb aboard the yacht before sailing away. However, Cthulhu dives into the ocean and pursues their fleeing vessel. Fortunately, Johansen turns his yacht around and rams it into the creature's head, which bursts with \\"a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish\\"- only to immediately begin regenerating. The Alert escapes from R'lyeh, with Briden having gone insane and dying soon afterwards. After finishing the manuscript, Thurston realizes he's now a possible target, thinking: \\"I know too much, and the cult still lives.\\" Literary significance and criticism Lovecraft regarded the short story as \\"rather middling‚Äînot as bad as the worst, but full of cheap and cumbrous touches\\". Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright first rejected the story, and only accepted it after writer Donald Wandrei, a friend of Lovecraft's, falsely claimed that Lovecraft was thinking of submitting it elsewhere.S.T. Joshi, More Annotated Lovecraft, p. 173. The published story was regarded by Robert E. Howard (the creator of Conan) as \\"a masterpiece, which I am sure will live as one of the highest achievements of literature.... Mr. Lovecraft holds a unique position in the literary world; he has grasped, to all intents, the worlds outside our paltry ken\\".Quoted in Peter Cannon, \\"Introduction\\", More Annotated Lovecraft, p. 7. Lovecraft scholar Peter Cannon regarded the story as \\"ambitious and complex...a dense and subtle narrative in which the horror gradually builds to cosmic proportions\\", adding \\"one of [Lovecraft's] bleakest fictional expressions of man's insignificant place in the universe\\".Cannon, pp. 6‚Äì7. French novelist Michel Houellebecq, in his book H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life, described the story as the first of Lovecraft's \\"great texts\\".Michel Houellebecq, H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life. Canadian mathematician Benjamin K. Tippett noted that the phenomena described in Johansen's journal may be interpreted as \\"observable consequences of a localized bubble of spacetime curvature\\", and proposed a suitable mathematical model. E. F. Bleiler has referred to \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" as \\"a fragmented essay with narrative inclusions\\".E.F. Bleiler, Supernatural Fiction Writers Vol, NY: Scribners, 1985, p. 478 Adaptations Parts of the story were adapted in Eerie #4 by Archie Goodwin and Gray Morrow and in The Avengers #88 by Harlan Ellison, Roy Thomas, and Sal Buscema. Alberto Breccia illustrated an eleven-page story in 1974. The story was produced as a silent film of the same name in 2005, and as a 1920s-style radio drama, Dark Adventure Radio Theatre: The Call of Cthulhu, in 2012. In 2005, the survival horror video game Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was released for Xbox and Windows PC. Call Girl of Cthulhu, released in 2014, was an indie horror film directed by Chris LaMartina, loosely based on Lovecraft's writings. Thrash metal band Metallica released an instrumental track called \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" on their 1984 album Ride the Lightning. In addition, they released \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" on their 1986 album Master of Puppets, \\"All Nightmare Long\\" on 2008's Death Magnetic, and \\"Dream No More\\" on 2016's Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, all dedicated to Lovecraft's Cthulhu, as well as the band's ex-bassist, Cliff Burton, who died in a bus accident in 1986, while touring in support of their album Master of Puppets. In 2018, a survival horror role-playing video game called Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game was developed for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows PC. In 2020, elements of The Call of Cthulhu were adapted in the science fiction horror film Underwater, directed by William Eubank and released by 20th Century Fox. In 2018, the villain Black Manta in the movie Aquaman directed by James Wan and released by DC quotes \\"The Call of Chulthu\\": \\"loathsomeness waits, and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men\\".

Activities Paul organised the first national mountain bike race in New Zealand in 1986 ‚Äì the Karapoti Classic. The Kennett Bros continued to run this annually until 2002, when they sold the event. In 1997 they co-organised a round of the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in Wellington. In 1998 they started building the Wellington City Council owned Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park, which received a national recreation award in 2002 and a national conservation award in 2003. From 2001 to 2006 the Kennett Bros coordinated a forest revegetation project at Otari-Wilton's Bush. 40,000 trees were planted over a five-year period. The Kennett Bros helped organise the 2006 Rotorua UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships. From 2010 to 2014 the Kennett Bros were a project manager on the New Zealand Cycle Trail. Publishing Paul ran a national mountain bike magazine called Mountain Bike New Zealand Magazine from 1988 to 1990. In 1991 the Kennett Bros wrote the first edition of Classic New Zealand Mountain Bike Rides, a national guidebook, which became a best seller. They produce new editions every three years (1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014). In 1995 Paul launched the Mountain Bike New Zealand Web, the online home for many New Zealand mountain bikers. In 2004 they published a history of cycling in New Zealand called RIDE: the story of cycling in New Zealand. From 2005 to 2013 they published a series of seven books on influential New Zealand cyclists called the New Zealand Cycling Legend Series.

Some modern species may possess biological immortality. Certain scientists, futurists, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that life extension is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of ageing would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or physical trauma; although mind uploading could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case. In religious contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of God (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow divine law. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial soul exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of religion, as well as the subject of speculation and debate. Definitions =Scientific= Life extension technologies promise a path to complete rejuvenation. Cryonics holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as hydra and planarian worms, it is indeed possible for a creature to be biologically immortal, it is not known if it will be possible for humans in the near-future. Mind uploading is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by futurists such as Ray Kurzweil. =Religious= Immortality in religion refers usually to either the belief in physical immortality or a more spiritual afterlife. The notion that immortality equals the eternal union of body and soul is typical of many religions. In traditions, such as ancient Egyptian religion, Mesopotamian religion, and Greek religion, the immortal gods consequently were considered to have physical bodies. In Mesopotamian and Greek religion, the gods also made certain men and women physical immortal, whereas in large parts of Christianity the belief that all true believers will be resurrected to physical immortality is a pivotal tenet. Similar beliefs that physical immortality is possible are held by Rastafarians or Rebirthers. Alchemy Alchemists strive to solve the mystery of immortality with the Philosopher's Stone and elixir of life. They believe through the application of alchemical processes, the physical body can be maintained through infinity, not dying by any natural diseases, only finding an end through physical destruction of the body. Theoretically if one could stay out of harm's way one could live forever. Physical immortality Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as cryonics, digital immortality, breakthroughs in rejuvenation, or predictions of an impending technological singularity. =Causes of death= There are three main causes of death: aging, disease and physical trauma. Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification. Aging Aubrey de Grey, a leading researcher in the field, defines aging as \\"a collection of cumulative changes to the molecular and cellular structure of an adult organism, which result in essential metabolic processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in pathology and death.\\" The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), DNA damage, oncogenic nuclear mutations and epimutations, cell senescence, mitochondrial mutations, lysosomal aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, immune system decline, and endocrine changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls engineered negligible senescence. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair. Academic Press, San Diego. Disease Disease is theoretically surmountable via technology. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up. Human understanding of genetics is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. Preventative medicine is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's may soon be curable with the use of stem cells. Breakthroughs in cell biology and telomere research are leading to treatments for cancer. Vaccines are being researched for AIDS and tuberculosis. Genes associated with type 1 diabetes and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the nervous system may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments. Trauma Physical trauma would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of paramedic response remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma. A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for nanotechnology, would mitigate this factor. Being the seat of consciousness, the brain cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people. Environmental change  Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, death through resource limitation is still possible, such as hypoxia or starvation. . If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the cumulative probability of death over an infinite horizon is less than certainty, even when the risk of fatal trauma in any finite period is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving \\"actuarial escape velocity\\" =Biological immortality= Human chromosomes (grey) capped by telomeres (white) Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it is the absence of a sustained increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal. Biologists have chosen the word \\"immortal\\" to designate cells that are not limited by the Hayflick limit, where cells no longer divide because of DNA damage or shortened telomeres. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is HeLa, developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of Henrietta Lacks without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of Leonard Hayflick, there was the erroneous belief fostered by Alexis Carrel that all normal somatic cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a \\"cap\\" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. Telomerase is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times. No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized. Biologically immortal species Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include: * Bacteria ‚Äì Bacteria reproduce through binary fission. A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 PLoS Biology paper suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger. * Turritopsis dohrnii, a jellyfish (phylum Cnidaria, class Hydrozoa, order Anthoathecata), after becoming a sexually mature adult, can transform itself back into a polyp using the cell conversion process of transdifferentiation. Turritopsis dohrnii repeats this cycle, meaning that it may have an indefinite lifespan. Its immortal adaptation has allowed it to spread from its original habitat in the Caribbean to \\"all over the world\\". * Hydra is a genus belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, the class Hydrozoa and the order Anthomedusae. They are simple fresh-water predatory animals possessing radial symmetry.Gilberson, Lance, Zoology Lab Manual, 4th edition. Primis Custom Publishing. 1999. * Bristlecone pines are speculated to be potentially immortal; the oldest known living specimen is over 5,000 years old. Evolution of aging As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no thermodynamic necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in free energy from the environment and unloads its entropy as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of evolution, but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere \\"end replication problem\\" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms.Clark, W.R. 1999. A Means to an End: The biological basis of aging and death. New York: Oxford University Press. About telomeres and programmed cell death. This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Ch. 69, \\"Cancer cell biology and angiogenesis\\", Robert G. Fenton and Dan L. Longo, p. 454. Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following: * Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by Peter Medawar in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual. * Antagonistic pleiotropy is a theory proposed as an alternative by George C. Williams, a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.Williams, G.C. 1957. Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence. Evolution, 11:398‚Äì411. Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy. * The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by Thomas Kirkwood, which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.Kirkwood, T.B.L. 1977. Evolution of aging. Nature, 270: 301‚Äì304. Origin of the disposable soma theory. =Prospects for human biological immortality= Life-extending substances Some scientists believe that boosting the amount or proportion of telomerase in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre (Madrid) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were \\"genetically engineered to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice\\". In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their Hayflick limit. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of DNA, and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging. Embryonic stem cells express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most somatic cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner. Technological immortality, biological machines, and \\"swallowing the doctor\\" Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, biological engineering, regenerative medicine, microbiology, and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of human cloning, cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. Robert Freitas, a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical nanorobots could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them.Robert A. Freitas Jr., Microbivores: Artificial Mechanical Phagocytes using Digest and Discharge Protocol, self- published, 2001 Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical biological machines, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book The Singularity Is Near that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a medical use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \\"swallow the doctor\\". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom. Cryonics Cryonics, the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and aging is reversible. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called vitrification which creates a glass- like state rather than freezing as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind. Mind-to-computer uploading One idea that has been advanced involves uploading an individual's habits and memories via direct mind-computer interface. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. Extropian futurists like Moravec and Kurzweil have proposed that, thanks to exponentially growing computing power, it will someday be possible to upload human consciousness onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of identity, thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined. It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of consciousness in the functions of the mind. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality. Research on neural correlates of consciousness is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them. A modern day example of Mind-to-computer immortality is displayed in Netflix's show Altered Carbon. In this show, immortality has been achieved through the use of \\"stacks\\" (modules that contain the consciousness of a person and is transferable). Altered Carbon displays both the ethics and qualities of enabling such a use of immortality. However, a main point to focus on here is that the timeline in the show is hundreds of years into the future. This is important to note because in today's time, millions of dollars are being poured into this venture with very little success. Millionaires like Tesla's Elon Musk, are currently working on the \\"mind uploading\\" process. As discussed above, a common theme correlated with \\"mind uploading\\" is cybernetics, in which this case, a \\"stack\\" could be considered cybernetic. Cybernetics Transforming a human into a cyborg can include brain implants or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed. Digital immortality Religious views As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the Syntopicon found in their compilation of the Great Books of the Western World, that \\"The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul.\\" Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the afterlife. =Ancient Greek religion= Immortality in ancient Greek religion originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in Homer, Hesiod, and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were Amphiaraus, Ganymede, Ino, Iphigenia, Menelaus, Peleus, and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. Asclepius was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus' Histories, the 7th century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus was not lost on early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued: \\"when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus.\\"Justin Martyr 1 Apol. 21. The philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a belief first appearing with either Pherecydes or the Orphics, and most importantly advocated by Plato and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. =Buddhism= According to one Tibetan Buddhist teaching, Dzogchen, individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the rainbow body. =Christianity= Adam and Eve condemned to mortality. Hans Holbein the Younger, Danse Macabre, 16th century Christian theology holds that Adam and Eve lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the Fall of man, although this initial \\"imperishability of the bodily frame of man\\" was \\"a preternatural condition\\". Christians who profess the Nicene Creed believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be resurrected from the dead at the Second Coming, and this belief is known as Universal resurrection. Whereas Paul the Apostle insisted that the resurrected body was only \\"spiritual\\"1\\\\. Cor. 15.44 and that \\"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God\\".1\\\\. Cor. 15.50, the Gospels increasingly emphasized the physical nature of the resurrection body ‚Äì as the resurrected Jesus in the Gospel of Luke insisting on his still consisting of \\"flesh and bones\\"Luke 24.37.. This shift may have been in response to traditional Greek expectations that immortality always included both body and soul. N.T. Wright, a theologian and former Bishop of Durham, has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told Time: \\"Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon his return. Part of this will be the resurrection of all the dead, who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says John Polkinghorne, a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the Intermediate state) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering Christ's kingdom.\\" This kingdom will consist of Heaven and Earth \\"joined together in a new creation\\", he said. =Hinduism= punarjanma. Illustration from Hinduism Today, 2004 Hindus believe in an immortal soul which is reincarnated after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called samsara. If they live their life well, their karma improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss. There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle. There are explicit renderings in the Upanishads alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated \\"When earth, water, fire, air and sky arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death.\\" Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi: > That man indeed whom these (contacts) > do not disturb, who is even-minded in > pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit > for immortality, O best of men.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a > New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, pp. 94‚Äì95 > (v 15) To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, \\"Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life ... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life.\\" An Indian Tamil saint known as Vallalar claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874. =Judaism= The traditional concept of an immaterial and immortal soul distinct from the body was not found in Judaism before the Babylonian exile, but developed as a result of interaction with Persian and Hellenistic philosophies. Accordingly, the Hebrew word nephesh, although translated as \\"soul\\" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to \\"living being\\".Biblical Studies Press (2006). New English Translation Notes. Note N23 on Gen 2:7. Nephesh was rendered in the Septuagint as ' (ps≈´ch√™), the Greek word for soul. The only Hebrew word traditionally translated \\"soul\\" (nephesh) in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.\\"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term \\"soul,\\" we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.\\", Avery- Peck, \\"Soul\\", in Neusner, et al. (eds.), \\"The Encyclopedia of Judaism\\", p. 1343 (2000) In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated \\"soul\\" () has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul. 'Soul' may refer to the whole person, the self: 'three thousand souls' were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23). The Hebrew Bible speaks about Sheol (◊©◊ê◊ï◊ú), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the resurrection of the dead. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the intertestamental period. The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in Second Temple period. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28. Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra- canonical books of Enoch,1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2. and in Apocalypse of Baruch.2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5 According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism Philip R. Davies, there is \\"little or no clear reference ... either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead\\" in the Dead Sea scrolls texts.Philip R. Davies. \\"Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls\\" in Alan J. Avery-Peck & Jacob Neusner (eds.) Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity. Leiden 2000:209. Both Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife,Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8. but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.Acta 23.8. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be reincarnated and \\"pass into other bodies,\\" while \\"the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.\\" Josephus Jewish War 2.8.14; cf. Antiquities 8.14‚Äì15. Jubilees seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.Jubilees 23.31 Rabbinic Judaism claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the Messianic Age with the coming of the messiah. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The Tanakh is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers. =Taoism= It is repeatedly stated in the L√ºshi Chunqiu that death is unavoidable. Henri Maspero noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality.Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion (University of Massachusetts Press, 1981), p. 211. Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a way of life than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non- Taoist historians have done.Robinet, Isabelle. Taoism: Growth of a Religion (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997 [original French 1992]), p. 3‚Äì4. In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.Translated by Legge, James. The Texts of Taoism. 1962, Dover Press. NY. =Zoroastrianism= Zoroastrians believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for \\"immortal\\" is associated with the month \\"Amurdad\\", meaning \\"deathless\\" in Persian, in the Iranian calendar (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or Ameretat is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the \\"Angel of Immortality\\" won over the \\"Angel of Death\\" in this month.Hoshang, Dr. Bhadha. http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul =Alcmaeon of Croton= Alcmaeon of Croton argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/#immort =Plato= Plato's Phaedo advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/ * The Cyclical Argument, or Opposites Argument explains that Forms are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily \\"imperishable\\". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets. * The Theory of Recollection explains that we possess some non- empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo. * The Affinity Argument, explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live. * The Argument from Form of Life or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die. =Plotinus= Plotinus offers a version of the argument that Kant calls \\"The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology\\". Plotinus first argues that the soul is simple, then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with Moses Mendelssohn's Phaedon.Henry, D. (2008) \\"The Neoplatonic Achilles\\" in \\"The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology\\". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp. 59‚Äì74. =Metochites= Theodore Metochites argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved ‚Äì an impossibility if they are one and the same.https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/byzantine-philosophy/#ImmSou =Avicenna= Avicenna argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.Avicenna's Metaphysics: Al-Shif√¢‚Äô, Al- Il√¢hiyy√¢t, ed. Mohammad Youssef Moussa, Solayman Dunya, Sa‚Äôid Zayed (Cairo, Organisme G√©n√©ral des Imprimeries Gouvernementales, 1960), II: 431‚Äì32; translated by A.J. Arberry, Aspects of Islamic Civilization (London, George Allen & Unwin, 1964), p. 153. See too Jean R, Michot, La destin√©e de l'homme selon Avicenne (Louvain, Peeters, 1986), pp. 22‚Äì56, and particularly pp. 26‚Äì27, and 43; J. Janssens, \\"Ibn S√Æn√¢'s Ideas of ultimate Realities, Neoplatonism and the Qur‚Äô√¢n as Problem-Solving paradigms in the Avicennian System,\\" Ultimate Reality and Meaning 10 (1987), 259‚Äì261. Cf. too Michael Marmura's complete translation, Avicenna: The Metaphysics of the Healing, Provo, Utah, Brigham Young University Press, 2005. =Aquinas= The full argument for the immortality of the soul and Thomas Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the Summa Theologica.https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/ =Descartes= Ren√© Descartes endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.Rozemond, M. (2010). \\"Descartes and the Immortality of the Soul\\". in Mind, Method and Morality: Essays in Honor of Anthony Kenny. Oxford University Press. =Leibniz= In early work, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his monadology he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/ =Moses Mendelssohn= Moses Mendelssohn's Phaedon is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue Phaedo, in which Socrates argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.Sassen, B. (2008). \\"Kant and Mendelssohn on the Implications of the 'I Think' \\".in \\"The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology\\". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp. 59‚Äì74. Ethics The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include persistent vegetative states, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, social and economic disparities created by longevity, and survival of the heat death of the universe. =Undesirability= Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in Mary Shelley's short story \\"The Mortal Immortal\\", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. Jorge Luis Borges explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story \\"The Immortal\\"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book Thursday's Fictions, and the stage and film adaptations of it, Richard James Allen tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him. Likewise, the novel Tuck Everlasting depicts immortality as \\"falling off the wheel of life\\" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In Anne Rice's book series The Vampire Chronicles, vampires are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse. Zardoz, a 1974 movie by John Goodman, features immortals and Brutals, with the former having listless lives. In The X-Files episode \\"Tithonus\\" (named after a Greek mythical character whose immortality was also highly unpleasant) Agent Scully meets an unhappy immortal man who is over two centuries old, after he had accidentally cheated death. He is miserable and longs for death. She queries him about why, arguing immortality is a great blessing. However, he replies that 70 years is all anyone really needs-after that it simply becomes unbearable. Elaborating, he tells her that after a time the details of his early life faded from his memory. As a result, he can no longer even remember his deceased wife's name. Further, being immortal has left him totally alone, since no one else has the same condition. He can also be wounded, though his injuries fade, and thus suffers yet still lives on. In his book Death, Yale philosopher Shelly Kagan argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same‚Äîthat is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now‚Äîthen eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed‚Äîe.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures‚Äîthen such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.Shelly Kagan, Death. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 238‚Äì46. As Kagan notes, his argument is an adaptation of a similar argument given by the British philosopher Bernard Williams in his book Problems of the Self (1973).  Sociology  If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the world's social structures. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own mortality shapes their behavior.[Dossey, Larry; In: Explore: The Journal of Science & Healing; Mar/Apr2017; v.13. n.2, 81‚Äì87. 7p. (editorial) , Database: CINAHL Complete] With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global demographic shift of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates. The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society. Immortality would increase population growth, bringing with it many consequences as for example the impact of population growth on the environment and planetary boundaries.  Politics  Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable, there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people. Symbols The ankh There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The ankh is an Egyptian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the gods and pharaohs, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The M√∂bius strip in the shape of a trefoil knot is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the Ouroboros, the Chinese fungus of longevity, the ten kanji, the phoenix, the peacock in Christianity, and the colors amaranth (in Western culture) and peach (in Chinese culture). Fiction Immortality is a popular subject in fiction, as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own mortality. Immortal beings and species abound in fiction, especially fantasy fiction, and the meaning of \\"immortal\\" tends to vary. The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal. Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the Q from the Star Trek series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with Morgoth in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion and the Dreaming God of Pathways Into Darkness. Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, Superman is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: Kryptonite. (See also Achilles' heel.) Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy elves often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as vampires and the immortals in the film Highlander, can only die from beheading. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a silver bullet (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight. The 2018 science fiction TV series Ad Vitam explored the social impact of biological immortality.

K. G√ºnther's Racial Elements of European History (1927) The Dinaric race, also known as the Adriatic race, were terms used by certain physical anthropologists in the early to mid-20th century to describe the perceived predominant phenotype of the contemporary ethnic groups of southeast Europe (a sub-type of Caucasoid race). History and physiognomy The concept of a Dinaric race originated with Joseph Deniker in the late 19th century, but became most closely associated with the writings of Carleton S. Coon and Nazi eugenicist Hans F. K. G√ºnther. The term was derived from the Dinaric Alps (the western part of Southeastern Europe) which was supposed to be the principal habitat of the race. According to Jan Czekanowski, the Dinaric race is a mixed type consisting of the Nordic race and Mediterranean race, which he proves by anthropological research involving geographical data, cephalic index, and characteristic racial features. He states: > The Dinaric type is characterized by quite light skin, dark hair from dark > brown to dark blonde, and a wide range of eye color; tall stature, a > brachycephalic skull, long face, a very narrow and prominent nose, sometimes > aquiline; a slender body type, and very big feet. Characteristics were defined as very tall, mostly mesomorph bodily build, with relatively long legs and short trunk and a long arm span. The overall anatomy of the head was said to be brachycephalic to hyperbrachycephalic (Cranial index: 81‚Äì86), i.e. a combination of high breadth of head and medium length of the neurocranium, whose back part is often somewhat flattened (planoccipital). The type has been described as follows: > The vertical height of the cranium is high. Eyes are set relatively close > and the surrounding tissue defines them as wide open. The iris is most often > brown, with a significant percentage of light pigmentation in the Dinaric > population. The nose is large, narrow and convex. The face is long and > orthognathic, with a prominent chin, and also wide. The form of the forehead > is variable, but not rarely it is bulbous. The hair color is usually dark > brown, with black-haired and blond individuals in minority, blondness being > the characteristic of the more Central European, morphologically similar > Noric race (a race intermediate between Nordic and Dinaric races). The skin > is lacking the rosy color characteristic for Northern Europe as well as the > relatively brunet pigmentation characteristic for the southernmost Europe > and on a geographical plane it is of medium pigmentation and often it is > variable. Origin and distribution Joseph Deniker's map of European races (1899) identified \\"Dinarics\\" as the dominant group in parts of central Europe, Northern Italy and the North West Balkans. Several theories were advanced regarding the genesis of the Dinaric race. Most researchers agreed that this race was autochthonous to its present habitat from the Neolithic period. Both G√ºnther and Coon claimed that the Bell-Beaker people of the European Bronze Age were at least partially Dinaric. Coon also argued, however, in The Origin of Races (1962), that the Dinaric and some other categories \\"are not races but simply the visible expressions of the genetic variability of the intermarrying groups to which they belong.\\" He referred to the creation of this distinctive phenotype from the mixing of earlier separate groups as \\"dinaricisation\\". In his view Dinarics were a specific type that arose from ancient mixes of the Mediterranean race and Alpine race. According to the Dinaric model, Dinarics were to be found mainly in the mountainous areas of Southeast Europe: Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria, part of northwestern Bulgaria, and northwestern Northern Macedonia. Northern and eastern Italy was considered mostly a Dinaric area as well as western Greece, Romania, Moldova, western Ukraine, southern Poland, southeastern German-speaking areas, and parts of southeastern France. \\"Noric\\" subtype The Noric race () was a racial category proposed by the anthropologist Victor Lebzelter. The \\"Noric race\\" was supposed to be a sub- type of the Dinaric race more Nordic in appearance than standard Dinaric peoples.Renato Biasutti on Caucasoid Subraces The term derived from Noricum, a province of the Roman Empire roughly equivalent to southern Austria and northern Slovenia. The term is not to be confused with Nordic. Norics were characterized by tall stature, brachycephaly, nasal convexity, long face and broad forehead. Their complexion was said to be light, and blondness combined with light eyes to be their anthropologic characteristic.

The role of human merit in Christian life is a point of dispute between Catholics and Protestants. Within Christianity, both Catholics and Lutherans affirm that \\"By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works\\". The Catholic Church further teaches that \\"When Catholics affirm the 'meritorious' character of good works, they wish to say that, according to the biblical witness, a reward in heaven is promised to these works. Their intention is to emphasize the responsibility of persons for their actions, not to contest the character of those works as gifts, or far less to deny that justification always remains the unmerited gift of grace\\". Roman Catholicism \\"speaks of merit in three distinct ways\\": condign merit (which God crowns freely), congruous merit (nonobligatory reward that may result in sanctifying grace), and supererogatory merit (given for doing above what a Christian is required). Reformed doctrine, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on the merit of Christ that humans receive through divine grace. Protestants generally teach that merit can never be used to earn or achieve salvation: \\"Because Christians are justified by faith alone, their standing before God is not in any way related to personal merit. Good works and practical holiness do not provide the grounds for acceptance with God.\\" \\"The only merit God accepts for salvation is that of Jesus Christ; nothing man can ever do could earn God‚Äôs favor or add anything to the merit of Christ.\\"  Catholicism  In Catholic philosophy, merit (as understood to be a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward), is a salutary act to which God, in whose service the work is done, in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward (pr≈ìmium, merces). =Nature of merit= Merit exists only in works that are positively good. The relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration, the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice, and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty (cf. Rom., xi, 6). If, however, salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward, this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace, and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace, as the Council of Trent emphatically declares (Sess. VI, cap. xvi, in Denzinger, 10th ed., Freiburg, 1908, n. 810): \\"the Lord ... whose bounty towards all men is so great, that He will have the things, which are His own gifts, be their merits.\\" Ethics and theology clearly distinguish two kinds of merit: * Condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word (meritum ad≈ìquatum sive de condigno), and * congruous or quasi-merit (meritum inad≈ìquatum sive de congruo). Condign merit supposes an equality between service and return; it is measured by commutative justice (justitia commutativa), and thus gives a real claim to a reward. Congruous merit, owing to its inadequacy and the lack of intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense, claims a reward only on the ground of equity. This early- scholastic distinction and terminology, which developed in the controversies with the Pelagians and Semipelagians, were again emphasized by Johann Eck, the famous adversary of Martin Luther (cf. Greying, \\"Joh. Eck als junger Gelehrter,\\" M√ºnster, 1906, pp. 153 sqq.). The essential difference between meritum de condigno and meritum de congruo is based on the fact that, besides those works which claim a remuneration under pain of violating strict justice (as in contracts between employer and employee, in buying and selling, etc.), there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or honour for reasons of equity (ex ≈ìquitate) or mere distributive justice (ex iustitia distributiva), as in the case of gratuities and military decorations. From an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that, if the reward due to condign merit be withheld, there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution, while, in the case of congruous merit, to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore, it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination (acceptio personarum). Hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver, though not purely and simply on his good will. In Christian theology, man possesses nothing of his own; all that he has and all that he does is a gift of God, and, since God is infinitely self-sufficient, there is no advantage or benefit which man can by his services confer upon him. Hence on the part of God there can only be question of a gratuitous promise of reward for certain good works. For such works he owes the promised reward, not in justice or equity, but because he has freely bound himself, i.e., because of his own attributes of veracity and fidelity. It is on this ground alone that we can speak of Divine justice at all, and apply the principle: Do ut des (cf. St. Augustine, Serm. clviii, c. ii, in P. L., XXXVIII, 863). =Conditions of merit= In Catholic teaching, for all true merit, there are seven conditions, of which four regard the meritorious work, two the agent who merits, and one God who rewards. In order to be meritorious, a work must be morally good, morally free, done with the assistance of actual grace, and inspired by a supernatural motive. As to the second requisite, i. e., moral liberty, it is clear from ethics that actions, due to external force or internal compulsion, can deserve neither reward nor punishment. It is an axiom of criminal jurisprudence that no one shall be punished for a misdeed done without free will; similarly, a good work can only then be meritorious and deserving of reward when it proceeds from a free determination of the will. This is the teaching of Christ (Matt., xix, 21): \\"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.\\" The necessity of the third condition, i. e., of the influence of actual grace, is clear from the fact that every act meriting heaven must evidently be supernatural just as heaven itself is supernatural, and that consequently it cannot be performed without the help of prevenient and assisting grace, which is necessary even for the just. The strictly supernatural destiny of the Beatific Vision, for which the Christian must strive, necessitates ways and means which lie altogether beyond what is purely natural (see GRACE). Finally, a supernatural motive is required because good works must be supernatural, not only as regards their object and circumstances, but also as regards the end for which they are performed (ex fine). But, in assigning the necessary qualities of this motive, theologians differ widely. While some require the motive of faith (motivum fidei) in order to have merit, others demand in addition the motive of charity (motivum caritatis), and thus, by rendering the conditions more difficult, considerably restrict the extent of meritorious works (as distinguished from merely good works). Others again set down as the only condition of merit that the good work of the just man, who already has habitual faith and charity, be in conformity with the Divine law, and require no other special motive. The agent who merits must both be in the state of pilgrimage (status vi≈ì) and in the state of grace (status grati≈ì). By the state of pilgrimage is to be understood our earthly life; death as a natural (although not an essentially necessary) limit, closes the time of meriting. The time of sowing is confined to this life; the reaping is reserved for the next, when no man will be able to sow either wheat or cockle. The opinion proposed by a few theologians (Hirscher, Schell), that for certain classes of men there may still be a possibility of conversion after death, is contrary to the revealed truth that the particular judgment (judicium particulare) determines instantly and definitively whether the future is to be one of eternal happiness or of eternal misery (cf. Kleutgen, \\"Theologie der Vorzeit\\", II, 2nd ed., M√ºnster, 1872, pp. 427 sqq.). Baptized children, who die before attaining the age of reason, are admitted to heaven without merits on the sole title of inheritance (titulus h≈ìreditatis); in the case of adults, however, there is the additional title of reward (titulus mercedis), and for that reason they will enjoy a greater measure of eternal happiness. In addition to the state of pilgrimage, the state of grace (i. e., the possession of sanctifying grace) is required for meriting, because only the just can be \\"sons of God\\" and \\"heirs of heaven\\" (cf. Rom., viii, 17). In the parable of the vine Christ expressly declares the \\"abiding in him\\" a necessary condition for \\"bearing fruit\\": \\"He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit\\" (John, xv, 5); and this constant union with Christ is effected only by sanctifying grace. In opposition to Vasquez, most theologians are of opinion that one who is holier will gain greater merit for a given work than one who is less holy, although the latter perform the same work under exactly the same circumstances and in the same way. The reason is that a higher degree of grace enhances the godlike dignity of the agent, and this dignity increases the value of the merit. Merit requires on the part of God that he accept (in actu secundo) the good work as meritorious, even though the work in itself (in actu primo) and previous to its acceptance by God, be already truly meritorious. Theologians, however, are not agreed as to the necessity of this condition. The Scotists hold that the entire condignity of the good work rests exclusively on the gratuitous promise of God and his free acceptance, without which even the most heroic act is devoid of merit, and with which even mere naturally good works may become meritorious.  Lutheranism and Calvinism  Martin Luther emphasized the merit of Christ by considering justification as entirely the work of God. When God's righteousness is mentioned in the gospel, it is God's action of declaring righteous the unrighteous sinner who has faith in Jesus Christ.Jaroslav Pelikan and Helmut Lehmann, eds., Luther's Works, 55 vols. (St. Louis and Philadelphia: Concordia Publishing House and Fortress Press, 1955-1986), 34:337 The righteousness by which the person is justified (declared righteous) is not his own (theologically, proper righteousness) but that of another, Christ, (alien righteousness). \\"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law,\\" said Luther. \\"Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ\\".Martin Luther's Definition of Faith Thus faith, for Luther, is a gift from God, and \\"...a living, bold trust in God's grace, so certain of God's favor that it would risk death a thousand times trusting in it.\\"Preface to Romans This faith grasps Christ's righteousness and appropriates it for the believer. He explained his concept of \\"justification\\" in preparation for the Council of Trent in his Smalcald Articles: Luther opposed the view that the law is not intended for Christians in the Antinomian Controversy with Johannes Agricola. In his 1532 Commentary on the Sermon of the Mount, Martin Luther criticized Catholic doctrine concerning condign merit. He noted that while the reward one gains from condign merit is much greater than that of congruent merit, the sort of good works said to attain each type of merit is similar. Luther thought it did not make sense that the two types of merit could be gained by similar actions when the benefit of condign merit is so much greater than the benefit of congruent merit. Commentary on the Sermon on the Mount translated by Charles A. Hay, 1892, page 97 According to the doctrine of Calvin (Instit., III, ii, 4) good works are \\"impurities and defilement\\" (inquinamenta et sordes), but God covers their innate hideousness with the cloak of the merits of Christ, and imputes them to the predestined as good works in order that he may requite them not with life eternal, but at most with a temporal reward. Apart from earlier dogmatic declarations given in the Second Synod of Orange of 529 and in the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 (see Denzinger, 191, 430), the Council of Trent upheld the traditional doctrine of merit by insisting that life everlasting is both a grace and a reward (Sess. VI, cap. xvi, in Denzinger, n. 809). It condemned as heretical Luther's doctrine of the sinfulness of good works (Sess. VI, can. xxv), and declared as a dogma that the just, in return for their good works done in God through the merits of Jesus, should expect an eternal reward (loc. cit., can. xxvi).

He is considered to be one of the pioneering figures of the television business in Puerto Rico. Early years Mu√±iz Ram√≠rez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on 4 February 1922, to Don Tom√°s Mu√±√≠z Souffront and Monserrate \\"Nena\\" Ram√≠rez. His father, Don Tom√°s, was a marketing executive who later became the administrator (and eventual owner) of various radio stations, as well as a radio producer.Chronicle of his life in Primera Hora Although Mu√±√≠z was born in Ponce, he was raised in the capital city of San Juan where he studied. Mu√±√≠z developed an interest in the entertainment business thanks to his father and to his uncle and godfather F√©lix Mu√±√≠z, who also produced radio programs.Article about his death in Primera Hora He started by being the messenger of the marketing firm where his father and uncle used to work, and eventually became a radio scriptwriter. Radio and television career = Radio producer = Mu√±iz was a successful radio producer in Puerto Rico during the mid- to late 1940s. Five of his radio programs -comedies for which he was often the scriptwriter, sometimes with the assistance of Sylvia Rexach- would consistently earn a strong following, as judged by the attendance to personal presentations of the artists featured in them. He was responsible for introducing more than a dozen new artists to the media. He bought Radio Luz 1600 (WLUZ-AM) a radio station in Bayam√≥n, Puerto RicoGarc√≠a, Beba, ¬°Juan, Juan, Juan! Cr√≥nicas de la televisi√≥n en los tiempos de don Tommy, Terranova Editores, San Juan, 2009; pg. 28 = Television producer = During the first years of commercial television in Puerto Rico, and after a brief period during which revenues from his radio productions trickled down, Mu√±iz opted to start producing television programs as well. He was producer or executive producer for dozens of television programs and specials between 1955 and 1995. At one time in the early 1960s, five programs produced by Mu√±iz were in the top five television rankings in local audience surveys. One of the programs even spawned a 1967 film, \\"La Criada Malcriada\\", starring Velda Gonz√°lez, Shorty Castro and Mu√±iz, among others. He is credited for producing most of Jos√© Miguel Agrelot's television programs during his career. He is also credited with discovering and promoting other television artists as well, particularly Otilio Warrington. In the 1970s he was the owner of WRIK-TV Channel 7 in Ponce. = Other enterprises = At one time or another, Mu√±iz also owned a restaurant (La Campana) in Cayey), a pet shop in San Juan, a zoo (Monoloro) in Carolina, a thoroughbred stable, and a summer camp for children (\\"Camp Gual√≠\\"). He later delegated many of the administrative functions of his production company as to concentrate in scriptwriting and acting. = Actors labor dispute = Mu√±iz was persuaded by his executive staff to produce Spanish soap operas, known as telenovelas. The lackluster performance of these programs as measured by television ratings contrasted significantly with the enormous success of his comedy productions. As a result, decisions were made to reduce the number of novelas produced and cut the company's payroll. As a consequence, at least one local actor, Jose Reymundi, lost his job. As a result, in November 1973, Puerto Rico witnessed one of the largest labor disputes between the local Actors Union and Tommy Mu√±iz Productions. In solidarity with Reymundi, seven actors left Mu√±iz's productions demanding fringe benefits from the company. Production on Mu√±iz's programs stopped for two weeks, with many unionized technicians joining the protesting actors at the picket line. The actors then formed Astra, an actors' conglomerate inspired by the origins of United Artists. Astra produced the experimental television programs Ah√≠ va eso (There Goes That) and Sin ton ni son (No tune no beat). The conglomerate dissolved shortly after. The strike left a lasting impression in Mu√±iz that sent him into a depression. Some of Astra's actors eventually reconciled with Mu√±iz. = Los Garcia: Memorable TV Hit = In the late 1970s, Mu√±iz revived a comedy format that he had successfully used in three previous radio and television productions, the family sitcom. He produced and acted in a comedy series named Los Garc√≠a together with his real-life son Rafo Mu√±iz, and with longtime friend Gladys Rodr√≠guez. Also starring were William Gracia as Pep√≠n, Gina Beveraggi as Gini, Edgardo Rubio as Junito, Manela Bustamante as Do√±a Tony, Emma Rosa Vincenty as Do≈àa Cayetana, and a number of additional actors in various roles. The show became the most successful television show in Puerto Rican history, having a mostly successful six-year run and staying for three of those years at the top of local television ratings. = Media Enterprises = During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mu√±iz was the owner of a radio station (Radio Luz WLUZ) and a television channel (Teleluz). Both were named after his wife, Luz Mar√≠a. In 1988, he became one of the largest minority owners of another channel, TeleOnce. = Film actor = In 1989, he and Rodr√≠guez reunited to act in the movie Lo que le Pas√≥ a Santiago, directed by Jacobo Morales, a longtime friend of Mu√±√≠z. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film becoming the first and only Puerto Rican film so far to do so. As a consequence of his part in Lo que le Pas√≥ a Santiago, Mu√±iz was selected to act in the 1991 television comedy film Crazy From The Heart, directed by Thomas Schlamme and featuring Christine Lahti and Rub√©n Blades. In the movie, Mu√±iz played Blades' father, a Mexican peasant with a proclivity for setting billboards on fire as a protest. The movie was eventually broadcast by Turner Network Television (TNT). Personal life Mu√±√≠z was married to Luz Mar√≠a Garc√≠a de la Noceda and they had eight children: Rafael (aka Rafo), Ruby, Hilda, Mario, Luzie, Tomito, Manolo, Pedro and F√©lix Antonio (To√±o). Rafo and Pedro are both well-known actors and producers and To√±o currently is Production Manager for various promoters in Puerto Rico. In the 80's and 90's To√±o was the producer of the yearly top Salsa event in the Caribbean, \\"Festival de Salsa Winston\\" ; Pedro directed a dramatic film, Cayo. Manolo was a businessman before his untimely death in July 1995. Tommy Mu√±√≠z died 15 January 2009 in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. Luz Mar√≠a Garc√≠a de la Noceda died a day after her 87th birthday, on 21 October 2011. Tommy Mu√±iz's life is described in two books: an autobiography named \\"As√≠ he vivido\\" (\\"That's the way I've lived\\") and \\"¬°Juan, Juan, Juan!

They are a group of amateur and mostly incompetent actors from around Athens, looking to make names for themselves by having their production chosen among several acts as the courtly entertainment for the royal wedding party of Theseus and Hippolyta. The servant-spirit Puck describes them as \\"rude mechanicals\\" in Act III, Scene 2 of the play, in reference to their occupations as skilled manual laborers. The biggest ham among them, Bottom, becomes the unlikely object of interest for the fairy queen Titania after she is charmed by a love potion and he is turned into a monster with the head of an ass by Puck. Peter Quince Peter Quince's name is derived from \\"quines\\" or \\"quoins\\", which are the strengthening blocks that form the outer corners of stone or brickwork in a building. =Playwriting= Quince's amateurish playwriting is usually taken to be a parody of the popular mystery plays of the pre-Elizabethan era, plays that were also produced by craftspeople. His metrical preferences are references to vernacular ballads. Despite Quince's obvious shortcomings as a writer, Stanley Wells argues that he partly resembles Shakespeare himself. Both are from a craftsmanly background, both work quickly and both take secondary roles in their own plays. Robert Leach makes the same point. In performing the play, Quince recites the prologue but struggles to fit his lines into the meter and make the rhymes. The noble audience makes jocular comments, whilst the rest of the mechanicals struggle (all except Bottom, who rather confidently improvises). =Characterization= Traditionally, Peter Quince is portrayed as a bookish character, caught up in the minute details of his play, but as a theatrical organizer. However, in the 1999 film version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, he is portrayed by Roger Rees as a strong character extremely capable of being a director. It is he who leads the search party looking for Nick Bottom in the middle of the play. =Cultural references= The character is named in the title of a Wallace Stevens poem, \\"Peter Quince at the Clavier\\", which is written in the first person as if spoken by Quince. Snug Snug playing the Lion in the play-within-the-play Pyramus and Thisbe, within William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Illustration by Louis Rhead for an edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare (1918). Snug is a minor character in the play. He is a joiner from Athens who is assigned by Peter Quince to play the part of the lion in Pyramus and Thisbe. When he is first assigned the part, he is afraid it may take him a while to finally remember his lines (even though the lion's role was nothing but roaring originally). Bottom offers to play the part of the lion (as he offers to play all other parts), but he is rejected by Quince, who worries (as do the other characters) that his loud and ferocious roar in the play will frighten the ladies of power in the audience and get Quince and all his actors hanged. In the end, the lion's part is revised to explain that he is in fact not a lion and means the audience no harm. Snug is often played as a stupid man, a manner describing almost all of the Mechanicals. Snug is the only Mechanical to whom the playwright did not assign a first name. In Jean-Louis and Jules Supervielle's french adaptation, Le Songe d'une nuit d'√©t√© (1959), Snug is renamed to , where Georges Neveux's 1945 adaptation used the English names. On the Elizabethan stage, the role of Snug and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with Titania's four fairy escorts: Moth, Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom. Nick Bottom Titania adoring the Ass-headed Bottom. Oil on canvas by Henry Fuseli, c. 1790 Nick Bottom provides comic relief throughout the play. A weaver by trade, he is famously known for getting his head transformed into that of a donkey by the elusive Puck. Bottom and Puck are the only two characters who converse with and progress the three central stories in the whole play. Puck is first introduced in the fairies' story and creates the drama of the lovers' story by messing up who loves whom, and places the donkey head on Bottom's in his story. Similarly, Bottom is performing in a play in his story intending it to be presented in the lovers' story, as well as interacting with Titania in the fairies' story. Francis Flute Francis Flute's occupation is a bellows-mender. He is forced to play the female role of Thisbe in \\"Pyramus and Thisbe\\", a play-within-the-play which is performed for Theseus' marriage celebration. In the play Flute (Thisbe) speaks through the wall (played by Tom Snout) to Pyramus (Nick Bottom). Flute is a young, excited actor who is disappointed when he finds he is meant to play a woman (Thisbe) in their interlude before the duke and the duchess. Flute's name, like that of the other mechanicals, is metonymical and derives from his craft: \\"Flute\\" references a church organ, an instrument prominently featuring the bellows a bellows-mender might be called upon to repair. In Jean-Louis and Jules Supervielle's french adaptation, Le Songe d'une nuit d'√©t√© (1959), Flute is renamed to , where Georges Neveux's 1945 adaptation used the English names. On the Elizabethan stage, the role of Flute and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with Titania's four fairy escorts: Moth (also spelled Mote), Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom. Tom Snout Nick Bottom (left), Francis Flute (right), and Tom Snout (background) playing Pyramus, Thisbe, and Wall in a 1978 Riverside Shakespeare Company production Tom Snout is a tinker, and one of the Mechanicals of Athens. In the play-within-a-play, Tom Snout plays the wall which separates Pyramus' and Thisbe's gardens. In Pyramus and Thisbe, the two lovers whisper to each other through Snout's fingers (representing a chink in the wall). Snout has eight lines under the name of Tom Snout, and two lines as The Wall. He is the Wall for Act V-Scene 1. Tom Snout was originally set to play Pyramus's father, but the need for a wall was greater, so he discharged The Wall. Snout is often portrayed as a reluctant actor and very frightened, but the other mechanicals (except Bottom and Quince) are usually much more frightened than Tom Snout. Snout's name, like that of the other mechanicals, is metonymical and derives from his craft: \\"Snout\\" means a nozzle or a spout, a feature of the kettles a tinker often mends. Robin Starveling Robin Starveling plays the part of Moonshine in their performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. His part is often considered one of the more humorous in the play, as he uses a lantern in a failed attempt to portray Moonshine and is wittily derided by his audience.

A similar argument, without this precise wording, is found in Meditations on First Philosophy (1641), and a Latin version of the same statement Cogito, ergo sum is found in Principles of Philosophy (1644). Discourse on the Method is one of the most influential works in the history of modern philosophy, and important to the development of natural sciences.Davis, Philip J., and Reuben Hersh. 1986. Descartes' Dream: The World According to Mathematics. Cambridge, MA: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. In this work, Descartes tackles the problem of skepticism, which had previously been studied by other philosophers. While addressing some of his predecessors and contemporaries, Descartes modified their approach to account for a truth he found to be incontrovertible; he started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions. The book was originally published in Leiden, in the Netherlands. Later, it was translated into Latin and published in 1656 in Amsterdam. The book was intended as an introduction to three works: Dioptrique, M√©t√©ores and G√©om√©trie. La G√©om√©trie contains Descartes's initial concepts that later developed into the Cartesian coordinate system. The text was written and published in French rather than Latin, the latter being the language in which most philosophical and scientific texts were written and published at that time. Most of Descartes' other works were written in Latin. Together with Meditations on First Philosophy, Principles of Philosophy and Rules for the Direction of the Mind, it forms the base of the epistemology known as Cartesianism. Organization The book is divided into six parts, described in the author's preface as: # Various considerations touching the Sciences # The principal rules of the Method which the Author has discovered # Certain of the rules of Morals which he has deduced from this Method # The reasonings by which he establishes the existence of God and of the Human Soul # The order of the Physical questions which he has investigated, and, in particular, the explication of the motion of the heart and of some other difficulties pertaining to Medicine, as also the difference between the soul of man and that of the brutes # What the Author believes to be required in order to greater advancement in the investigation of Nature than has yet been made, with the reasons that have induced him to write = Part I: Various scientific considerations = Descartes begins by allowing himself some wit: \\"...the reading of good books is like a conversation with the best men of past centuries‚Äì\\" (Discourse part I, AT p. 5) A similar observation can be found in Hobbes: \\"But this proveth rather that men are in that point equal, than unequal. For there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with his share,\\"http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXIII but also in Montaigne, whose formulation indicates that it was a commonplace at the time: \\"Tis commonly said that the justest portion Nature has given us of her favors is that of sense; for there is no one who is not contented with his share.\\" Descartes continues with a warning: Descartes describes his disappointment with his education: \\"[A]s soon as I had finished the entire course of study‚Ä¶I found myself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I had advanced no farther‚Ä¶than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance.\\" He notes his special delight with mathematics, and contrasts its strong foundations to \\"the disquisitions of the ancient moralists [which are] towering and magnificent palaces with no better foundation than sand and mud.\\" = Part II: Principal rules of the Method = Descartes was in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country, and describes his intent by a \\"building metaphor\\" (see also: Neurath's boat). He observes that buildings, cities or nations that have been planned by a single hand are more elegant and commodious than those that have grown organically. He resolves not to build on old foundations, or to lean upon principles which, he had taken on faith in his youth. Descartes seeks to ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the knowledge of whatever lay within the compass of his powers; he presents four precepts: = Part III: Morals and Maxims of conducting the Method = Descartes uses the analogy of rebuilding a house from secure foundations, and extends the analogy to the idea of needing a temporary abode while his own house is being rebuilt. The following three maxims were adopted by Descartes so that he could effectively function in the \\"real world\\" while experimenting with his method of radical doubt. They formed a rudimentary belief system from which to act before he developed a new system based on the truths he discovered using his method: = Part IV: Proof of God and the Soul= Applying the method to itself, Descartes challenges his own reasoning and reason itself. But Descartes believes three things are not susceptible to doubt and the three support each other to form a stable foundation for the method. He cannot doubt that something has to be there to do the doubting (I think, therefore I am). The method of doubt cannot doubt reason as it is based on reason itself. By reason there exists a God, and God is the guarantor that reason is not misguided. Descartes supplies three different proofs for the existence of God, including what is now referred to as the ontological proof of the existence of God. = Part V: Physics, the heart, and the soul of man and animals = Here he describes how in other writings he discusses the idea of laws of nature, of the sun and stars, the idea of the moon being the cause of ebb and flow, on gravitation, and going on to discuss light and fire. Describing his work on light, he states: His work on such physico-mechanical laws is, however, projected into a \\"new world.\\" A theoretical place God created Descartes does this \\"to express my judgment regarding ... [his subjects] with greater freedom, without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned\\". He goes on to say that he \\"was not, however, disposed, from these circumstances, to conclude that this world had been created in the manner I described; for it is much more likely that God made it at the first such as it was to be.\\" Despite this admission, it seems that Descartes' project for understanding the world was that of re-creating creation‚Äîa cosmological project which aimed, through Descartes' particular brand of experimental method, to show not merely the possibility of such a system, but to suggest that this way of looking at the world‚Äîone with (as Descartes saw it) no assumptions about God or nature‚Äîprovided the only basis upon which he could see knowledge progressing (as he states in Book II). Thus, in Descartes' work, we can see some of the fundamental assumptions of modern cosmology in evidence‚Äîthe project of examing the historical construction of the universe through a set of quantitative laws describing interactions which would allow the ordered present to be constructed from a chaotic past. He goes on to the motion of the blood in the heart and arteries, endorsing the findings of \\"a physician of England\\" about the circulation of blood, referring to William Harvey and his work De motu cordis in a marginal note. But then he disagrees strongly about the function of the heart as a pump, ascribing the motive power of the circulation to heat rather than muscular contraction.W. Bruce Fye: Profiles in Cardiology ‚Äì Ren√© Descartes, Clin. Cardiol. 26, 49‚Äì51 (2003), Pdf 58,2 kB. He describes that these motions seem to be totally independent of what we think, and concludes that our bodies are separate from our souls. He does not seem to distinguish between mind, spirit and soul, which are identified as our faculty for rational thinking. Hence the term \\"I think, therefore I am.\\" All three of these words (particularly \\"mind\\" and \\"soul\\") can be identified by the single French term √¢me. = Part VI: Prerequisites for advancing the investigation of Nature = Descartes begins by noting, without directly referring to it, the recent trial of Galileo for heresy and the condemnation of heliocentrism; he explains that for these reasons he has been slow to publish.\\"Three years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise containing all these matters; and I was beginning to revise it, with the view to put it into the hands of a printer, when I learned that persons to whom I greatly defer, and whose authority over my actions is hardly less influential than is my own reason over my thoughts, had condemned a certain doctrine in physics, published a short time previously by another individual to which I will not say that I adhered, but only that, previously to their censure I had observed in it nothing which I could imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state, and nothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression to it in writing, if reason had persuaded me of its truth; and this led me to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found in which I had departed from the truth, notwithstanding the great care I have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which I had not the most certain demonstrations, and not to give expression to aught that might tend to the hurt of any one. This has been sufficient to make me alter my purpose of publishing them; for although the reasons by which I had been induced to take this resolution were very strong, yet my inclination, which has always been hostile to writing books, enabled me immediately to discover other considerations sufficient to excuse me for not undertaking the task.\\" Secure on these foundation stones, Descartes shows the practical application of \\"the Method\\" in Mathematics and the Science. Influencing future science Skepticism had previously been discussed by philosophers such as Sextus Empiricus, Al-Ghazali, Francisco S√°nchez and Michel de Montaigne. Descartes started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions or influences. This is summarized in the book's first precept to \\"never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such\\". This method of pro-foundational skepticism is considered to be the start of modern philosophy.Descartes' Life and Works by Kurt Smith, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

First published in 1956, it is his last complete work of fiction. Set in Amsterdam, The Fall consists of a series of dramatic monologues by the self-proclaimed \\"judge-penitent\\" Jean-Baptiste Clamence, as he reflects upon his life to a stranger. In what amounts to a confession, Clamence tells of his success as a wealthy Parisian defense lawyer who was highly respected by his colleagues. His crisis, and his ultimate \\"fall\\" from grace, was meant to invoke, in secular terms, the fall of man from the Garden of Eden. The Fall explores themes of innocence, imprisonment, non-existence, and truth. In a eulogy to Albert Camus, existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described the novel as \\"perhaps the most beautiful and the least understood\\" of Camus' booksTribute to Albert Camus by Jean-Paul Satre.  Setting  Clamence often speaks of his love for high, open places ‚Äî everything from mountain peaks to the top decks of boats. \\"I have never felt comfortable,\\" he explains, \\"except in lofty surroundings. Even in the details of daily life, I need to feel above\\". Then it is paradoxical that Clamence leads his cher ami away from the human symmetries of a picturesque town to sit on a level, seaside expanse. The location of Amsterdam, as a city below sea-level, therefore assumes particular significance in relation to the narrator. Moreover, Amsterdam is generally described in The Fall as a cold, wet place where a thick blanket of fog constantly hangs over the crowded, neon-light-lined streets. Beside the atmosphere (which could be established almost anywhere else) the city also was chosen by Camus for a more peculiar reason. In the opening pages Clamence casually remarks, Amsterdam The \\"last circle of hell\\" is the site of Amsterdam's red-light district and the location of a bar named Mexico City, which Clamence frequents nightly, and where the bulk of his narrative gradually unfolds. (The bar, Mexico City, did exist in Amsterdam.)In the novel, Clamence mentions \\"sailors' bars in the Zeedijk\\". In the 1950s, a bar called Mexico City was located much near the Zeedijk, at Warmoesstraat 91. Camus visited the area in October 1954, when a Dutch acquaintance took him on a tour of \\"hidden\\" locations in Amsterdam. The setting thus serves to illustrate, literally and metaphorically, Clamence's fall from the heights of high-class Paris society to the dark, dreary, Dantesque underworld of Amsterdam, where tortured souls wander aimlessly among each other. Indeed, critics have explored at length the parallels between Clamence's fall and Dante's descent through Hell in the Inferno (see Galpin, King). It is also significant, particularly as Camus develops his philosophical ideas, that the story develops against the backdrop of the Second World War and the Holocaust. Clamence tells us that he lives only a short distance from Mexico City, in what was ‚Äî formerly ‚Äî the Jewish Quarter, \\"until our Hitlerian brethren spaced it out a bit. ... I am living on the site of one of the greatest crimes in history\\" (Camus 281). The naming of the bar also recalls the destruction of the Aztec civilization whose ruined capital has been supplanted by modern Mexico City. Among other things, The Fall is an attempt to explain how humankind could be capable of perpetrating such evils.  Synopsis  = Life in Paris = The novel opens with Clamence sitting in the bar Mexico City casually talking to a stranger ‚Äî the reader, some would say ‚Äî about the proper way to order a drink; for here, despite the cosmopolitan nature of Amsterdam, the bartender refuses to respond to anything other than Dutch. Thus, Clamence serves as interpreter and he and the stranger, having discovered that they are fellow compatriots who, moreover, both hail from Paris, begin discussing more substantive matters. Clamence tells us that he used to lead an essentially perfect life in Paris as a highly successful and well-respected defence lawyer. The vast majority of his work centred around \\"widow and orphan\\" cases, that is, the poor and disenfranchised who otherwise would be unable to provide themselves with a proper defence before the law. He also relates anecdotes about how he always enjoyed giving friendly directions to strangers on the streets, yielding to others his seat on the bus, giving alms to the poor, and, above all, helping the blind to cross the street. In short, Clamence conceived of himself as living purely for the sake of others and \\"achieving more than the vulgar ambitious man and rising to that supreme summit where virtue is its own reward\\" (Camus 288). Late one night when crossing the Pont Royal on his way home from his \\"mistress\\", however, Clamence comes across a woman dressed in black leaning over the edge of the bridge. He hesitates for a moment, thinking the sight strange at such an hour and given the barrenness of the streets, but continues on his way nevertheless. He had only walked a short distance when he heard the distinct sound of a body hitting the water. Clamence stops walking, knowing exactly what has happened, but does nothing ‚Äî in fact, he doesn't even turn around. The sound of screaming was Despite Clamence's view of himself as a selfless advocate for the weak and unfortunate, he simply ignores the incident and continues on his way. He later elaborates that his failure to do anything was most probably because doing so would have required him to put his own personal safety in jeopardy. Several years after the apparent suicide of the woman off the Pont Royal ‚Äî and an evidently successful effort to purge the entire event from his memory ‚Äî Clamence is on his way home one autumn evening after a particularly pleasing day of work. He pauses on the empty Pont des Arts and reflects: Clamence turns around to discover that the laughter, of course, was not directed at him, but probably originated from a far-off conversation between friends ‚Äî such is the rational course of his thought. Nevertheless, he tells us that \\"I could still hear it distinctly behind me, coming from nowhere unless from the water.\\" The laughter is thus alarming because it immediately reminds him of his obvious failure to do anything whatsoever about the woman who had presumably drowned years before. The unlucky coincidence for Clamence here is that he is reminded of this precisely at the moment when he is congratulating himself for being such a selfless individual. Furthermore, the laughter is described as a \\"good, hearty, almost friendly laugh,\\" whereas, mere moments later, he describes himself as possessing a \\"good, hearty badger\\" (Camus 297). This implies that the laughter originated within himself, adding another dimension to the inner meaning of the scene. That evening on the Pont des Arts represents, for Clamence, the collision of his true self with his inflated self-image, and the final realization of his own hypocrisy becomes painfully obvious. A third and final incident initiates Clamence's downward spiral. One day while waiting at a stoplight, Clamence finds that he is trapped behind a motorcycle which has stalled ahead of him and is unable to proceed once the light changes to green as a result. Other cars behind him start honking their horns, and Clamence politely asks the man several times if he would please move his motorcycle off the road so that others can drive around him; however, with each repetition of the request, the motorcyclist becomes increasingly agitated and threatens Clamence with physical violence. Angry, Clamence exits his vehicle in order to confront the man when someone else intervenes and \\"informed me that I was the scum of the earth and that he would not allow me to strike a man who had a motor-cycle between his legs and hence was at a disadvantage\\" (Camus 303-4). Clamence turns to respond to his interlocutor when suddenly the motorcyclist punches him in the side of the head and then speeds off. Without retaliating against his interlocutor, Clamence, utterly humiliated, merely returns to his car and drives away. Later, he runs through his mind \\"a hundred times\\" what he thinks he should have done ‚Äî namely strike his interlocutor, then chase after the motorcyclist and run him off the road. The feeling of resentment gnaws away at him, and Clamence explains that Clamence thus arrives at the conclusion that his whole life has in fact been lived in search of honour, recognition, and power over others. Having realized this, he can no longer live the way he once did. = Crisis = Clamence initially attempts to resist the sense that he has lived hypocritically and selfishly. He argues with himself over his prior acts of kindness, but quickly discovers that this is an argument he cannot win. He reflects, for example, that whenever he had helped a blind man across the street ‚Äî something he especially enjoyed doing ‚Äî he would doff his hat to the man. Since the blind man obviously cannot see this acknowledgement, Clamence asks, \\"To whom was it addressed? To the public. After playing my part, I would take my bow\\" (Camus 301). As a result, he comes to see himself as duplicitous and hypocritical. This realization precipitates an emotional and intellectual crisis for Clamence which, moreover, he is unable to avoid, having now discovered it; the sound of laughter that first struck him on the Pont des Arts slowly begins to permeate his entire existence. In fact, Clamence even begins laughing at himself as he defends matters of justice and fairness in court. Unable to ignore it, Clamence attempts to silence the laughter by throwing off his hypocrisy and ruining the reputation he acquired therefrom. Clamence thus proceeds to \\"destroy that flattering reputation\\" (Camus 326) primarily by making public comments that he knows will be received as objectionable: telling beggars that they are \\"embarrassing people,\\" declaring his regret at not being able to hold serfs and beat them at his whim, and announcing the publication of a \\"manifesto exposing the oppression that the oppressed inflict on decent people.\\" In fact, Clamence even goes so far as to consider To Clamence's frustration and dismay, however, his efforts in this regard are ineffective, generally because many of the people around him refuse to take him seriously; they find it inconceivable that a man of his reputation could ever say such things and not be joking. Clamence eventually realizes that his attempts at self-derision can only fail, and the laughter continues to gnaw at him. This is because his actions are just as dishonest: \\"In order to forestall the laughter, I dreamed of hurling myself into the general derision. In fact, it was still a question of dodging judgment. I wanted to put the laughters on my side, or at least to put myself on their side\\" (Camus 325). Ultimately, Clamence responds to his emotional- intellectual crisis by withdrawing from the world on precisely those terms. He closes his law practice, avoids his former colleagues in particular and people in general, and throws himself completely into uncompromising debauchery; while humankind may be grossly hypocritical in the areas from which he has withdrawn, \\"no man is a hypocrite in his pleasures\\" (Camus 311 ‚Äì a quotation from Samuel Johnson). Debauchery (women and alcohol) does prove a temporarily effective means of silencing the laughter‚Äîthe biting sense of his own hypocrisy‚Äîbecause, as he explains, it thoroughly dulls his wits. Unfortunately, he finds himself unable to maintain this lifestyle due to personal failings that he describes as follows: \\"...my liver and an exhaustion so terrible that it still has not left me (?)\\" = Life in Amsterdam = Copy of the panel from the Ghent Altarpiece known as The Just Judges by Jef Van der Veken. The original was stolen in 1934 and never recovered. The last of Clamence's monologues takes place in his apartment in the (former) Jewish Quarter, and recounts more specifically the events which shaped his current outlook; in this regard his experiences during the Second World War are crucial. With the outbreak of war and the fall of France, Clamence considers joining the French Resistance, but decides that doing so would ultimately be futile. He explains, Instead, Clamence decides to flee Paris for London, and takes an indirect route there, moving through North Africa; however, he meets a friend while in Africa and decides to stay and find work, eventually settling in Tunis. But after the Allies land in Africa, Clamence is arrested by the Germans and thrown into a concentration camp ‚Äî \\"chiefly [as] a security measure,\\" he assures himself (Camus 343). While interned, Clamence meets a comrade, introduced to the reader only as \\"Du Guesclin\\", who had fought in the Spanish Civil War, was captured by \\"the Catholic general\\", and now found himself in the hands of the Germans in Africa. These experiences subsequently caused the man to lose his faith in the Catholic Church (and perhaps in God as well); as a form of protest Du Guesclin announces the need for a new Pope ‚Äî one who will \\"agree to keep alive, in himself and in others, the community of our sufferings\\" ‚Äî to be chosen from among the prisoners in the camp. As the man with \\"the most failings,\\" Clamence jokingly volunteers himself, but finds that the other prisoners agree with his appointment. As a result of being selected to lead a group of prisoners as \\"Pope,\\" Clamence is afforded certain powers over them, such as how to distribute food and water and deciding who will do what kind of work. \\"Let's just say that I closed the circle,\\" he confesses, \\"the day I drank the water of a dying comrade. No, no, it wasn't Du Guesclin; he was already dead, I believe, for he stinted himself too much\\" (Camus 343-4). Clamence then relates the story of how a famous fifteenth- century painting, a panel from the Ghent Altarpiece known as The Just Judges, came into his possession. One evening a regular patron of Mexico City entered the bar with the priceless painting and sold it for a bottle of jenever to the bartender who, for a time, displayed the piece prominently on the wall of his bar. (Both the man who sold the painting and the now-vacant place on the wall where it hung are cryptically pointed out at the beginning of the novel.) However, Clamence eventually informs the bartender that the painting is in fact stolen, that police from several countries are searching for it, and offers to keep it for him; the bartender immediately agrees to the proposal. Clamence attempts to justify his possession of the stolen painting in a number of ways, primarily \\"because those judges are on their way to meet the Lamb, because there is no lamb or innocence any longer, and because the clever rascal who stole the panel was an instrument of the unknown justice that one ought not to thwart\\" (Camus 346). The full story of the Ghent Altarpiece and the \\"Just Judges\\" panel, along with its role in Camus' novel, is told in Noah Charney's 2010 book, Stealing the Mystic Lamb: the True Story of the World's Most Coveted Masterpiece. Finally, Clamence employs the imagery of the Ghent Altarpiece and The Just Judges to explain his self-identification as a \\"judge- penitent\\". This essentially espouses a doctrine of relinquished freedom as a method of enduring the suffering imposed on us by virtue of living in a world without objective truth and one that is therefore, ultimately meaningless. With the death of God, one must also accept by extension the idea of universal guilt and the impossibility of innocence. Clamence's argument posits, somewhat paradoxically, that freedom from suffering is attained only through submission to something greater than oneself. Clamence, through his confession, sits in permanent judgment of himself and others, spending his time persuading those around him of their own unconditional guilt. The novel ends on a sinister note: \\"Pronounce to yourself the words that years later haven't ceased to resound through my nights, and which I will speak at last through your mouth: \\"O young girl, throw yourself again into the water so that I might have a second time the chance to save the two of us!\\" A second time, eh, what imprudence! Suppose, dear sir, someone actually took our word for it? It would have to be fulfilled. Brr...! the water is so cold! But let's reassure ourselves. It's too late now, it will always be too late. Fortunately!\\"  Publication history  * 1956, La Chute (French), Paris: Gallimard * 1956, The Fall (translated by Justin O'Brien) * 2006, The Fall (translated by Robin Buss), London: Penguin  References  Text * Camus, Albert.

He was born in San Fernando, Trinidad. He became active in calypso in the mid-1930s, and was considered a country bumpkin by his contemporaries, because of his humble beginning. It was Grant's tailor who gave him his moniker by commenting, \\"I tell you, Rupert, you should call yourself Lord Invader so when you go up to the city you be invadin' the capital.\\" With a new name, in 1937 he went to the capital city of Port of Spain and began his career in earnest. He competed in many calypso competitions (including the very first Calypso King competition) and recorded for RCA Bluebird. Lured by Decca Records, he travelled to New York City in 1941 with other calypsonians such as Roaring Lion and Atilla the Hun to make records and promote calypso music. He wrote many calypsos; his most famous lyrics, \\"Rum and Coca-Cola\\", were plagiarised by Morey Amsterdam and became a hit for the Andrews Sisters. Invader travelled to New York and sued, eventually winning compensation, although the final settlement allowed Amsterdam to retain his copyright. In the early 1940s, radio stations in the USA refused to play his own version on the grounds of its using the trademarked name, Coca-Cola, and its references to prostitution and alcohol. He stayed in New York for a few years because of the lengthy court case. During his tenure in New York City, he became a fixture in the local calypso scene and recorded many tracks for Moses Asch. Eventually, he won his court case, but did not receive his settlement check for seven years, so he returned to Trinidad in the meantime. He opened a calypso club there and penned and recorded many original songs. He is often credited with writing \\"Zombie Jamboree\\", although the song was actually written by Lord Intruder (Winston O'Conner), who released it on the B-side of his 1953 single \\"Disaster with Police\\". It was covered by Conrad Eugene Mauge Jr, who recorded it in 1959 and was also often credited for writing it. The confusion probably stems from the introduction of the version by the Kingston Trio, which mentions \\"Lord Invader and his Twelve Penetrators\\". At long last, Invader collected his money from his court case, and began to tour the U.S., later expanding to Britain and Europe. In the last half of 1958, he returned to New York City and continued recording for Moses Asch. He continued to return to his homeland for business and pleasure, although he had, with Wilmoth Houdini, made himself one of America's most successful calypsonians. On 15 October 1961, Lord Invader died at a Brooklyn, New York hospital. The following discs give a good idea of his work: * Calypso in New York (Smithsonian Folkways 40454), released in 2000, is a collection of Invader's recordings across his whole career. * Calypso at Midnight and Calypso After Midnight come from a live recording organized by Alan Lomax in New York in 1946. * Calypso War, Kings of Calypso, and Trojan Calypso boxed set all feature the same set of songs recorded in the United Kingdom in the 1950s. * Folkways Records also have a number of CDs that Invader recorded in the late 1950s in New York, including, Calypso (1955), Calypso Travels, and There's a Brown Boy in the Ring and Other Children's Calypso Songs (1959).

Thebes was also known as \\"the city of the 100 gates\\", sometimes being called \\"southern Heliopolis\\" ('Iunu-shemaa' in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of Iunu or Heliopolis, the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as niw.t, which simply means \\"city\\", and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was used (the other two were Memphis and Heliopolis); it was also called niw.t rst, \\"southern city\\", as the southernmost of them. The importance of the city started as early as the 11th Dynasty, when the town grew into a thriving city. Montuhotep II, who united Egypt after the troubles of the First Intermediate Period, brought stability to the lands as the city grew in stature. The Pharaohs of the New Kingdom in their expeditions to Kush, in today's northern Sudan, and to the lands of Canaan, Phoenicia and Syria saw the city accumulate great wealth and rose to prominence, even on a world scale. Thebes played a major role in expelling the invading forces of the Hyksos from Upper Egypt, and from the time of the 18th Dynasty to the 20th Dynasty, the city had risen as the political, religious and military capital of Ancient Egypt. The city attracted peoples such as the Babylonians, the Mitanni, the Hittites of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the Canaanites of Ugarit, the Phoenicians of Byblos and Tyre, the Minoans from the island of Crete. A Hittite prince from Anatolia even came to marry with the widow of Tutankhamun, Ankhesenamun. The political and military importance of the city, however, faded during the Late Period, with Thebes being replaced as political capital by several cities in Northern Egypt, such as Bubastis, Sais and finally Alexandria. However, as the city of the god Amun-Ra, Thebes remained the religious capital of Egypt until the Greek period. The main god of the city was Amun, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess Mut, and their son Khonsu, the God of the moon. With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amun rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new 'king of gods' Amun-Ra. His great temple at Karnak, just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity. Later, the city was attacked by Assyrian emperor Assurbanipal who installed a new prince on the throne, Psamtik I. The city of Thebes was in ruins and fell in significance. However, Alexander the Great did arrive at the temple of Amun, where the statue of the god was transferred from Karnak during the Opet Festival, the great religious feast. Thebes remained a site of spirituality up to the Christian era, and attracted numerous Christian monks of the Roman Empire who established monasteries amidst several ancient monuments including the temple of Hatshepsut, now called Deir el-Bahri (\\"the northern monastery\\"). = Archaeology = In October 2019, Egyptian archeologists headed by Zahi Hawass revealed an ancient \\"industrial area\\" used to manufacture decorative artefacts, furniture and pottery for royal tombs. The site contained a big kiln to fire ceramics and 30 ateliers. According to Zahi Hawass, each atelier had a different aim ‚Äì some of them were used to make pottery, others used to produce gold artefacts and others still to churn out furniture. About 75 meters below the valley, several items believed to have adorned wooden royal coffins, such as inlaid beads, silver rings and gold foil were unearthed. Some artefacts depicted the wings of deity Horus. In October 2019, the Egyptian archaeological mission unearthed thirty well-preserved wooden coffins (3,000-year-old) in front of the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in El-Assasif Cemetery. The coffins contained mummies of twenty-three adult males, five adult females and two children, who are believed to be from the middle class. According to Hawass, mummies were decorated with mixed carvings and designs, including scenes from Egyptian gods, hieroglyphs, and the Book of the Dead, a series of spells that allowed the soul to navigate in the afterlife. Some of the coffins had the names of the dead engraved on them.

Aswan and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any other city in Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have nearly the same climate. Luxor is one of the sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are above during summer (June, July, August) During the coldest month of the year, average high temperatures remain above while average low temperatures remain above . The climate of Luxor has precipitation levels lower than even most other places in the Sahara, with less than of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air in Luxor is more humid than Aswan but still very dry. There is an average relative humidity of 39.9%, with a maximum mean of 57% during winter and a minimum mean of 27% during summer. The climate of Luxor is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with about some 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close of the maximum theoretical sunshine duration. In addition, Luxor, Minya, Sohag, Qena and Asyut have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in Egypt, with almost difference. The hottest temperature recorded was on May 15, 1991 which was and the coldest temperature was on February 6, 1989 which was .  Coptic Catholic Eparchy  The Coptic Catholic (Alexandrian Rite) minority established on November 26, 1895 an Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Luqsor (Luxor) alias Thebes, on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt. Its episcopal see is a St. George cathedral in Luxor. In turn, it lost territory on August 10, 1947 to establish the Eparchy of Assiut and again on 14 September 1981 to establish Sohag. =Suffragan Eparchs (Bishops) of Luqsor (Coptic Rite)= * Ignazio Glad√®s Berzi (March 6, 1896 ‚Äì died January 29, 1925) * Marc Khouzam (August 6, 1926 ‚Äì August 10, 1947), also Apostolic Administrator of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (December 30, 1927 ‚Äì August 10, 1947); later Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria (10 August 10, 1947 ‚Äì died February 2, 1958) * Isaac Ghattas (June 21, 1949 ‚Äì May 8, 1967), later Archbishop-Bishop of Minya of the Copts (Egypt) (May 8, 1967 ‚Äì died June 8, 1977) * Amba Andraos Ghattas, Lazarists (C.M.)

Large numbers of people also work in agriculture, particularly sugarcane. There are also many industries, such as the pottery industry used in eating and many other uses. The local economy was hit by the Luxor massacre in 1997, in which a total of 64 people (including 59 visiting tourists) were killed, at the time the worst terrorist attack in Egypt (before the Sharm el-Sheikh terrorist attacks).Shock in Sharm 23 July, Serene Assir, Al-Ahram Weekly The massacre reduced tourist numbers for several years.\\"Solidly ahead of oil, Suez Canal revenues, and remittances, tourism is Egypt's main hard currency earner at $6.5 billion per year.\\" (in 2005) ... concerns over tourism's future accessed 27 September 2007 Following the 2011 Arab Spring, tourism to Egypt dropped significantly, again affecting local tourist markets. To make up for shortfalls of income, many cultivate their own food. Goat's cheese, pigeons, subsidized and home-baked bread and homegrown tomatoes are commonplace among the majority of its residents.  Tourism development  Street market Winter Palace Hotel A controversial tourism development plan aims to transform Luxor into the biggest vast open-air museum. The master plan envisions new roads, five-star hotels, glitzy shops, and an IMAX theatre. The main attraction is an 11 million dollar project to unearth and restore the long Avenue of Sphinxes that once linked Luxor and Karnak temples. The ancient processional road was built by the pharaoh Amenhotep III and took its final form under Nectanebo I in 400 BCE. Over a thousand sphinx statues lined the road now being excavated which was covered by silt, homes, mosques and churches. Excavation started around 2004. On 18 April 2019, the Egyptian Government announced the discovery of a previously unopened coffin in Luxor, dated back to 18th dynasty of Upper and Lower Egypt. According to the Minister of Antiquities Khaled el Anani, it is the biggest rock-cut tomb to be unearthed in the ancient city of Thebes. It is one of the largest, well-preserved tombs ever found near the ancient city of Luxor. On 24 November 2018, this discovery was preceded by the finding of a well-preserved mummy of a woman inside a previously unopened coffin dating back more than 3,000 years. =2013 hot air balloon crash= Nineteen Asian and European tourists died when a hot air balloon crashed early on Tuesday, February 26, 2013 near Luxor following a mid-air gas explosion. It was one of the worst accidents involving tourists in Egypt and likely to push the tourism industry deeper into recession. The casualties included French, British, Hungarian, Japanese nationals and nine tourists from Hong Kong.(Times of India, Indore, MP, India edition Wed, February 27, 2013)  Infrastructure  =Transport= Luxor International Airport Luxor is served by Luxor International Airport. A bridge was opened in 1998, a few kilometres upstream of the main town of Luxor, allowing ready land access from the east bank to the west bank. Traditionally river crossings have been the domain of several ferry services. The so-called 'local ferry' (also known as the 'National Ferry') continues to operate from a landing opposite the Temple of Luxor. Luxor railway station Transport to sites on the west bank are serviced by taxi drivers who often approach ferry passengers. There are also local cars that reach some of the monuments for 2 L.E. , although tourists rarely use them. Alternatively, motorboats line both banks of the Nile all day providing a quicker, but more expensive (50 L.E.), crossing to the other side. The city of Luxor on the east bank has several bus routes used mainly by locals. Tourists often rely on horse carriages, called \\"cal√®ches\\", for transport or tours around the city. Taxis are plentiful, and reasonably priced, and since the government has decreed that taxis older than 20 years will not be relicensed, there are many modern air-conditioned cabs. Recently, new roads have been built in the city to cope with the growth in traffic. For domestic travel along the route of the Nile, a rail service operates several times a day. A morning train and sleeping train can be taken from the railway station situated around from Luxor Temple. The line runs between several major destinations, including Cairo to the north and Aswan to the south.  Luxor University  Luxor University, founded in 2019, is a non-profit governmental university that provides high-quality programs and course for students.

It may take the form of a law or a non-binding declaration. Typically a patient's bill of rights guarantees patients information, fair treatment, and autonomy over medical decisions, among other rights.  India  Under the direction of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), India's National Human Rights Commission drafted a Charter of Patients' Rights in 2018. Following a recommendation by the National Council of Clinical Establishments, MOHFW submitted the draft in the public domain for comments and suggestions on August 2018. The Charter draws upon different provisions relevant to patients' rights that were previously scattered across the Constitution of India, the Drugs and Cosmetic Act of 1940, the Clinical Establishment Act of 2010, and various judgments by the Supreme Court of India, among other sources. The Charter aims to: # provide a reference for State Governments to enact or modify existing regulation. # provide a framework of healthcare standards for service providers. # And, raise awareness among patients about their rights. = Recognized patients' rights = The Charter of Patients' Rights lists seventeen rights that patients are entitled to: * Right to information: Every patient has the right to know what is the illness that they are suffering, its causes, the status of the diagnosis (provisional or confirmed), expected costs of treatment. Furthermore, service providers should communicate this in a manner that is understandable for the patient. * Right to records and reports: The patient has the right to access his/her medical records and investigation reports. Service providers should make these available upon the patients' payment of any photocopy fees as applicable. * Right to emergency care: Public and private hospitals have an obligation to provide emergency medical care regardless of the patients' capacity to pay for the services. * Right to informed consent: Patients have the right to be asked for their informed consent before submitting to potentially hazardous treatment. Physicians should clearly explain the risks from receiving the treatment and only administer the treatment after getting explicit written consent from the patient. * Right to confidentiality, human dignity and privacy: Doctors should observe strict confidentiality of a patient's condition, with the only exception of potential threats to public health. In case of a physical inspection by a male doctor on a female patient, the latter has the right to have a female person present throughout the procedure. Hospitals also have an obligation to secure patient information from any external threats. * Right to second opinion: Patients are entitled to seek a second opinion and hospitals should facilitate any information or records that the patient requires to do so. * Right to transparency in rates, and care according to prescribed rates wherever relevant: Hospitals should display the rates that they charge in a visible manner and patients should receive an itemized bill when payment is required. Essential medicines, devices and implants should comply with rates established by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). * Right to non-discrimination: Service providers cannot deny treatment on the basis of gender, caste, religion, age, sexual orientation or social origins. Additionally, it is against the Charter to deny treatment on the basis of a patients' health condition, including HIV status. * Right to safety and quality care according to standards: Hospitals must ensure a hygienic and sanitized environment to provide their services. * Right to choose alternative treatment options if available: Patients have the right to consider treatment alternatives and even refuse treatment. * Right to choose source for obtaining medicines or tests: Any registered pharmacy and laboratory is eligible to provide patients with goods and services they require. * Right to proper referral and transfer, which is free from perverse commercial influences: In case of transfers or referrals, the patient has the right to an explanation that justifies the transfer, as well as confirmation from the hospital receiving the patient about their acceptance of the transfer. * Right to protection for patients involved in clinical trials: Clinical trials should comply with all the standards and protocols under the Directorate General of Health Services. * Right to protection of participants involved in biomedical and health research: Studies involving patients should follow the National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants. * Right to take discharge of patient, or receive body of deceased from hospital: Patients have the right to be discharged and may not be detained at a health service provider facility because of procedural reasons such as payment disputes. * Right to Patient Education: In addition to information about their condition, patients have the right to know about public health services such as insurance schemes and charitable hospitals. * Right to be heard and seek redressal: Patients have the right to provide feedback and comments to their health service providers and file complaints as required. They additionally have the right to redressal in cases where any of their rights are violated. United Kingdom In the UK, the Patient's Charter was introduced and revised in the 1990s. It was replaced by the NHS Constitution for England in 2013. United States In the United States there have been a number of attempts to enshrine a patient's bill of rights in law, including a bill rejected by Congress in 2001. =Bill of 2001= A rally for the patients' bill of rights proposed in 2001, with Bill Clinton, Joe Hoeffel, Ron Klink, Ed Rendell, and Chaka Fattah. The United States Congress considered a bill designed to safeguard patients' rights in 2001. The \\"Bipartisan Patient Protection Act\\" (S.1052), sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy and John McCain, contained new rules for what health maintenance organizations had to cover and granted new rights for patients to sue in state or federal courts, if they are denied needed care. The House of Representatives and Senate passed differing versions of the proposed law. Although both bills would have provided patients key rights, such as prompt access to emergency care and medical specialists, only the Senate-passed measure would provide patients with adequate means to enforce their rights. The Senate's proposal would have conferred a broad array of rights on patients. It would have ensured that patients with health care plans had the right to: *have their medical decisions made by a doctor; *see a medical specialist; *go to the closest emergency room; The bill was passed by the US Senate by a vote of 59‚Äì36 in 2001, it was then amended by the House of Representatives and returned to the Senate. However, it ultimately failed. =Industry resistance= Wendell Potter, former senior executive at Cigna turned whistleblower, has written that the insurance industry has worked to kill \\"any reform that might interfere with insurers' ability to increase profits\\" by engaging in extensive and well-funded, anti-reform campaigns. The industry, however, \\"goes to great lengths to keep its involvement in these campaigns hidden from public view,\\" including the use of \\"front groups.\\" Indeed, in a successful 1998 effort to kill the Patient Bill of Rights then, > ‚Äúthe insurers formed a front group called the Health Benefits Coalition to > kill efforts to pass a Patients Bill of Rights. While it was billed as a > broad-based business coalition that was led by the National Federation of > Independent Business and included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Health > Benefits Coalition in reality got the lion‚Äôs share of its funding and > guidance from the big insurance companies and their trade associations.

Karl Marx's theory of alienation describes the social alienation () of people from aspects of their human nature (Gattungswesen, 'species-essence') as a consequence of living in a society of stratified social classes. The alienation from the self is a consequence of being a mechanistic part of a social class, the condition of which estranges a person from their humanity. The theoretical basis of alienation within the capitalist mode of production is that the worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity this worker is directed to goals and diverted to activities that are dictated by the bourgeoisie‚Äîwho own the means of production‚Äîin order to extract from the worker the maximum amount of surplus value in the course of business competition among industrialists. In the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 (1932), Karl Marx expressed the Entfremdung theory‚Äîof estrangement from the self. Philosophically, the theory of Entfremdung relies upon The Essence of Christianity (1841) by Ludwig Feuerbach, which states that the idea of a supernatural god has alienated the natural characteristics of the human being. Moreover, Max Stirner extended Feuerbach's analysis in The Ego and its Own (1845) that even the idea of 'humanity' is an alienating concept for individuals to intellectually consider in its full philosophic implication. Marx and Friedrich Engels responded to these philosophical propositions in The German Ideology (1845).  Types of alienation  In a capitalist society, the worker's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can express labour‚Äîa fundamental social aspect of personal individuality‚Äîonly through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument: i.e., a thing, not a person. In the \\"Comment on James Mill\\" (1844), Marx explained alienation thus: > Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. Each of > us would have, in two ways, affirmed himself, and the other person. (i) In > my production I would have objectified my individuality, its specific > character, and, therefore, enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of > my life during the activity, but also, when looking at the object, I would > have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective, > visible to the senses, and, hence, a power beyond all doubt. (ii) In your > enjoyment, or use, of my product I would have the direct enjoyment both of > being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work, that is, of > having objectified man's essential nature, and of having thus created an > object corresponding to the need of another man's essential nature ... Our > products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential > nature.Marx, Karl. 1844. \\"Comment on James Mill.\\" Economic and Philosophical > Manuscripts of 1844. In the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 (1844/1932), Marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a capitalist system of industrial production. They are alienation of the worker from their product, from the act of production, from their Gattungswesen ('species-essence') and from other workers.\\"Alienation.\\" Pp. 10. in A Dictionary of Philosophy (rev. 2nd ed.). 1984. = From their product = The design of the product and how it is produced are determined, not by the producers who make it (the workers), nor by the consumers of the product (the buyers), but by the capitalist class who besides accommodating the worker's manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the engineer and the industrial designer who create the product in order to shape the taste of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal profit. Aside from the workers having no control over the design-and- production protocol, alienation (Entfremdung) broadly describes the conversion of labour (work as an activity), which is performed to generate a use value (the product), into a commodity, which‚Äîlike products‚Äîcan be assigned an exchange value. That is, the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour, with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products (goods and services) that benefit the consumer. Moreover, the capitalist production system also reifies labour into the \\"concrete\\" concept of \\"work\\" (a job), for which the worker is paid wages‚Äîat the lowest-possible rate‚Äîthat maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist's investment capital; this is an aspect of exploitation. Furthermore, with such a reified system of industrial production, the profit (exchange value) generated by the sale of the goods and services (products) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes: the functional capitalist, who manages the means of production; and the rentier capitalist, who owns the means of production. = From the act of production = textile factory strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, United States, called when owners reduced wages after a state law reduced the work week from 56 to 54 hours In the capitalist mode of production, the generation of products (goods and services) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete, repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for \\"a job well done.\\" By means of commodification, the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages (an exchange value); the psychological estrangement (Entfremdung) of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor. The worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms; wage compulsion and the imposed production content. The worker is bound to unwanted labour as a means of survival, labour is not \\"voluntary but coerced\\" (forced labor). The worker is only able to reject wage compulsion at the expense of their life and that of their family. The distribution of private property in the hands of wealth owners, combined with government enforced taxes compel workers to labor. In a capitalist world, our means of survival is based on monetary exchange, therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist. The worker \\"[d]oes not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself;\\" \\"[l]abor is external to the worker,\\"Marx, Karl. [1844] 1932. Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844. it is not a part of their essential being. During work, the worker is miserable, unhappy and drained of their energy, work \\"mortifies his body and ruins his mind.\\" The production content, direction and form are imposed by the capitalist. The worker is being controlled and told what to do since they do not own the means of production they have no say in production, \\"labor is external to the worker, i.e. it does not belong to his essential being. A person's mind should be free and conscious, instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist, \\"the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else's, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another.\\" This means he cannot freely and spontaneously create according to his own directive as labor's form and direction belong to someone else. = From their Gattungswesen (species-essence) = The Gattungswesen ('species-essence' or 'human nature'), human nature of individuals is not discrete (separate and apart) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person. Conceptually, in the term species-essence, the word species describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterized by a \\"plurality of interests\\" and \\"psychological dynamism,\\" whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being, by means of emotional connections with other people, with society. The psychic value of a human consists in being able to conceive (think) of the ends of their actions as purposeful ideas, which are distinct from the actions required to realize a given idea. That is, humans are able to objectify their intentions by means of an idea of themselves as \\"the subject\\" and an idea of the thing that they produce, \\"the object.\\" Conversely, unlike a human being an animal does not objectify itself as \\"the subject\\" nor its products as ideas, \\"the object,\\" because an animal engages in directly self-sustaining actions that have neither a future intention, nor a conscious intention. Whereas a person's Gattungswesen does not exist independently of specific, historically conditioned activities, the essential nature of a human being is actualized when an individual‚Äîwithin their given historical circumstance‚Äîis free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people.  Relations of production  Whatever the character of a person's consciousness (will and imagination), societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival, which is fundamentally dependent upon cooperation with others, thus, a person's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively (collectively), not subjectively (individually), because humans are a social animal. In the course of history, to ensure individual survival societies have organized themselves into groups who have different, basic relationships to the means of production. One societal group (class) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the relations of production of that status quo the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class. In the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy‚Äîagrarian feudalism superseded by mercantilism, in turn superseded by the Industrial Revolution‚Äîthe rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the technologies (the means of production) that made possible the change in the relations of production. Likewise, there occurred a corresponding rearrangement of the human nature (Gattungswesen) and the system of values of the owner-class and of the working-class, which allowed each group of people to accept and to function in the rearranged status quo of production-relations. Despite the ideological promise of industrialization‚Äîthat the mechanization of industrial production would raise the mass of the workers from a brutish life of subsistence existence to honorable work‚Äîthe division of labour inherent to the capitalist mode of production thwarted the human nature (Gattungswesen) of the worker and so rendered each individual into a mechanistic part of an industrialized system of production, from being a person capable of defining their value through direct, purposeful activity. Moreover, the near-total mechanization and automation of the industrial production system would allow the (newly) dominant bourgeois capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive. Hence, when the proletarian working-class become a sufficiently developed political force, they will effect a revolution and re-orient the relations of production to the means of production‚Äîfrom a capitalist mode of production to a communist mode of production. In the resultant communist society, the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker's labour; the worker's humanity (Gattungswesen) thus respected, men and women would not become alienated. In the communist socio-economic organization, the relations of production would operate the mode of production and employ each worker according to their abilities and benefit each worker according to their needs. Hence, each worker could direct their labour to productive work suitable to their own innate abilities, rather than be forced into a narrowly defined, minimum-wage \\"job\\" meant to extract maximal profit from individual labour as determined by and dictated under the capitalist mode of production. In the classless, collectively-managed communist society, the exchange of value between the objectified productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class, but instead will be directed to meet the needs of each producer and consumer. Although production will be differentiated by the degree of each worker's abilities, the purpose of the communist system of industrial production will be determined by the collective requirements of society, not by the profit-oriented demands of a capitalist social class who live at the expense of the greater society. Under the collective ownership of the means of production, the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society. The direct distribution of the fruits of the labour of each worker to fulfill the interests of the working class‚Äîand thus to an individuals own interest and benefit‚Äîwill constitute an un-alienated state of labour conditions, which restores to the worker the fullest exercise and determination of their human nature. = From other workers = Capitalism reduces the labour of the worker to a commercial commodity that can be traded in the competitive labour-market, rather than as a constructive socio-economic activity that is part of the collective common effort performed for personal survival and the betterment of society. In a capitalist economy, the businesses who own the means of production establish a competitive labour- market meant to extract from the worker as much labour (value) as possible in the form of capital. The capitalist economy's arrangement of the relations of production provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for \\"higher wages\\", thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests; the effect is a false consciousness, which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist bourgeoisie through its cultural hegemony. Furthermore, in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of religion in justifying the relations of production facilitates the realization and then worsens the alienation (Entfremdung) of the worker from their humanity; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being \\"the opiate of the masses\\".Marx on Alienation  Philosophical significance and influences  Philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770‚Äì1831) postulated the idealism that Marx countered with dialectical materialism Philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach (1804‚Äì1872) analysed religion from a psychological perspective in The Essence of Christianity (1841) and according to him divinity is humanity's projection of their human nature In Marxist theory, Entfremdung ('alienation') is a foundational proposition about man's progress towards self-actualisation. In the Oxford Companion to Philosophy (2005), Ted Honderich described the influences of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach upon Karl Marx: > For Hegel, the unhappy consciousness is divided against itself, separated > from its \\"essence\\", which it has placed in a \\"beyond\\". As used by philosophers Hegel and Marx, the reflexive German verbs ent√§ussern ('to divest one's self of') and entfremden ('to become estranged') indicate that the term alienation denotes self-alienation: to be estranged from one's essential nature.Langenscheidt New College Dictionary. German‚ÄìEnglish/English‚ÄìGerman. 1973. pp. 166‚Äì67. Therefore, alienation is a lack of self-worth, the absence of meaning in one's life, consequent to being coerced to lead a life without opportunity for self-fulfillment, without the opportunity to become actualized, to become one's self.Honderich, Ted. 2005. Oxford Companion to Philosophy. Oxford: Oxford University Press. In The Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), Hegel described the stages in the development of the human Geist ('spirit'), by which men and women progress from ignorance to knowledge, of the self and of the world. Developing Hegel's human-spirit proposition, Marx said that those poles of idealism‚Äî\\"spiritual ignorance\\" and \\"self-understanding\\"‚Äîare replaced with material categories, whereby \\"spiritual ignorance\\" becomes \\"alienation\\" and \\"self-understanding\\" becomes man's realisation of his Gattungswesen (species-essence). =Entfremdung and the theory of history = In Part I: \\"Feuerbach ‚Äì Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook\\" of The German Ideology (1846), Karl Marx said the following: > Things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate > the existing totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self- > activity, but also, merely, to safeguard their very existence. That humans psychologically require the life activities that lead to their self-actualisation as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance because the capitalist mode of production eventually will exploit and impoverish the proletariat until compelling them to social revolution for survival. Yet, social alienation remains a practical concern, especially among the contemporary philosophers of Marxist humanism. In The Marxist-Humanist Theory of State-Capitalism (1992), Raya Dunayevskaya discusses and describes the existence of the desire for self-activity and self-actualisation among wage-labour workers struggling to achieve the elementary goals of material life in a capitalist economy. =Entfremdung and social class = In Chapter 4 of The Holy Family (1845), Marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated, but that each social class experiences alienation in a different form: > The propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human > self-estrangement. But the former class feels at ease and strengthened in > this self-estrangement, it recognizes estrangement as its own power, and has > in it the semblance of a human existence. The class of the proletariat feels > annihilated, this means that they cease to exist in estrangement; it sees in > it its own powerlessness and in the reality of an inhuman existence. It is, > to use an expression of Hegel, in its abasement, the indignation at that > abasement, an indignation to which it is necessarily driven by the > contradiction between its human nature and its condition of life, which is > the outright, resolute and comprehensive negation of that nature. Within > this antithesis, the private property-owner is therefore the conservative > side, and the proletarian the destructive side. From the former arises the > action of preserving the antithesis, from the latter the action of > annihilating it.Chapter 4 of The Holy Family- see under Critical Comment No. > 2  Criticism  In discussion of \\"random materialism\\" (mat√©rialisme al√©atoire), French philosopher Louis Althusser criticized such a teleological (goal-oriented) interpretation of Marx's theory of alienation because it rendered the proletariat as the subject of history; an interpretation tainted with the Hegelian idealism of the \\"philosophy of the subject,\\" which he criticized as the \\"bourgeois ideology of philosophy\\" (see History and Class Consciousness [1923] by Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs).Bullock, Allan, and Stephen Trombley, eds. 1999. \\"Alienation.\\" Pp. 22 in The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought.

It was purchased by its rival Adobe Inc. on December 3, 2005. History Macromedia originated in the 1992 merger of Authorware Inc. (makers of Authorware) and MacroMind-Paracomp (makers of Macromind Director). Director, an interactive multimedia-authoring tool used to make presentations, animations, CD-ROMs, and information kiosks, served as Macromedia's flagship product until the mid-1990s. Authorware was Macromedia's principal product in the interactive learning market. As the Internet moved from a university research medium to a commercial network, Macromedia began working to web-enable its existing tools and develop new products like Dreamweaver. Macromedia created Shockwave, a Director-viewer plugin for web browsers. The first multimedia playback in Netscape's browser was a Director plug-in. Macromedia licensed Sun's Java Programming Language in October 1995. By 2002, Macromedia produced more than 20 products and had 30 offices in 13 different countries. =Acquisitions= In January 1995, Macromedia acquired Altsys Corporation after Adobe Systems announced a merger with Altsys' business partner, the Aldus Corporation. Altsys was the developer of the vector-drawing program FreeHand, which had been licensed by Aldus for marketing and sales. Because of the similarities with Adobe Illustrator, the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint in October 1994 ordering a divestiture of FreeHand back to Altsys. With Macromedia's acquisition of Altsys, it received FreeHand thus expanding its product line of multimedia graphics software to include illustration and design graphics software. FreeHand's vector graphics rendering engine and other software components within the program would prove useful to Macromedia in the development of Fireworks. In March 1996, Macromedia acquired iBand Software, makers of the Backstage HTML authoring tool and application server. Macromedia developed a new HTML-authoring tool, Dreamweaver, around portions of the Backstage codebase and released the first version in 1997. At the time, most professional web authors preferred to code HTML by hand using text editors because they wanted full control over the source. Dreamweaver addressed this with its \\"Roundtrip HTML\\" feature, which attempted to preserve the fidelity of hand-edited source code during visual edits, allowing users to work back and forth between visual and code editing. Over the next few years Dreamweaver became widely adopted among professional web authors, though many still preferred to hand-code, and Microsoft FrontPage remained a strong competitor among amateur and business users. Macromedia acquired FutureWave Software, makers of FutureSplash Animator, in November 1996. FutureSplash Animator was an animation tool originally developed for pen-based computing devices. Because of the small size of the FutureSplash Viewer application, it was particularly suited for download over the Internet, where most users, at the time, had low-bandwidth connections. Macromedia renamed Splash to Macromedia Flash, and following the lead of Netscape, distributed the Flash Player as a free browser plugin in order to quickly gain market share. As of 2005, more computers worldwide had the Flash Player installed than any other Web media format, including Java, QuickTime, RealNetworks, and Windows Media Player. As Flash matured, Macromedia's focus shifted from marketing it as a graphics and media tool to promoting it as a Web application platform, adding scripting and data access capabilities to the player while attempting to retain its small footprint. Macromedia logo used until 1997 In December 1999, Macromedia acquired traffic analysis software company Andromedia Corporation. Web development company Allaire was acquired in 2001 and Macromedia added several popular servers and Web developments tools to its portfolio, including ColdFusion, a web application server based on the CFML language, JRun, a Java EE application server, and HomeSite, an HTML code editor that was also bundled with Dreamweaver. In 2003, Macromedia acquired the web conferencing company Presedia and continued to develop and enhance their Flash-based online collaboration and presentation product offering under the brand Breeze. Later that year, Macromedia also acquired help authoring software company eHelp Corporation, whose products included RoboHelp and RoboDemo (now Adobe Captivate). =Purchase= On April 18, 2005, Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at approximately $3.4 billion on the last trading day before the announcement. The acquisition took place on December 3, 2005, and Adobe integrated the company's operations, networks, and customer care organizations shortly thereafter. =Lawsuits= On August 22, 1997, stockholders filed a class-action lawsuit in the California Superior Court in San Francisco, accusing Macromedia of misleading stockholders on the company's product success and financial health. A similar suit had been filed a month earlier. The class-action suit was dismissed by a federal judge on May 19, 1998. On August 10, 2000, Adobe claimed that Macromedia violated two of its patents on tabbed palettes. Macromedia countered with a claim that Adobe infringed on Macromedia's patents for a draw-based editor for Web pages and a hierarchical structure editor for Web sites. In July 2002, Adobe and Macromedia reached an agreement that settled all claims in this series of patent suits. Eventually, Adobe acquired Macromedia 3 years later.

An MMU effectively performs virtual memory management, handling at the same time memory protection, cache control, bus arbitration and, in simpler computer architectures (especially 8-bit systems), bank switching.  Overview  Schematic of the operation of an MMU Modern MMUs typically divide the virtual address space (the range of addresses used by the processor) into pages, each having a size which is a power of 2, usually a few kilobytes, but they may be much larger. The bottom bits of the address (the offset within a page) are left unchanged. The upper address bits are the virtual page numbers. = Page table entries = Most MMUs use an in-memory table of items called a \\"page table\\", containing one \\"page table entry\\" (PTE) per page, to map virtual page numbers to physical page numbers in main memory. An associative cache of PTEs is called a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) and is used to avoid the necessity of accessing the main memory every time a virtual address is mapped. Other MMUs may have a private array of memory or registers that hold a set of page table entries. The physical page number is combined with the page offset to give the complete physical address. A PTE may also include information about whether the page has been written to (the \\"dirty bit\\"), when it was last used (the \\"accessed bit,\\" for a least recently used (LRU) page replacement algorithm), what kind of processes (user mode or supervisor mode) may read and write it, and whether it should be cached. Sometimes, a PTE prohibits access to a virtual page, perhaps because no physical random access memory has been allocated to that virtual page. In this case, the MMU signals a page fault to the CPU. The operating system (OS) then handles the situation, perhaps by trying to find a spare frame of RAM and set up a new PTE to map it to the requested virtual address. If no RAM is free, it may be necessary to choose an existing page (known as a \\"victim\\"), using some replacement algorithm, and save it to disk (a process called \\"paging\\"). With some MMUs, there can also be a shortage of PTEs, in which case the OS will have to free one for the new mapping. The MMU may also generate illegal access error conditions or invalid page faults upon illegal or non-existing memory accesses, respectively, leading to segmentation fault or bus error conditions when handled by the operating system. = Benefits = VLSI VI475 MMU \\"Apple HMMU\\" from the Macintosh II used with the Motorola 68020 In some cases, a page fault may indicate a software bug, which can be prevented by using memory protection as one of key benefits of an MMU: an operating system can use it to protect against errant programs by disallowing access to memory that a particular program should not have access to. Typically, an operating system assigns each program its own virtual address space. An MMU also mitigates the problem of fragmentation of memory. After blocks of memory have been allocated and freed, the free memory may become fragmented (discontinuous) so that the largest contiguous block of free memory may be much smaller than the total amount. With virtual memory, a contiguous range of virtual addresses can be mapped to several non-contiguous blocks of physical memory; this non-contiguous allocation is one of the benefits of paging. In some early microprocessor designs, memory management was performed by a separate integrated circuit such as the VLSI Technology VI475 (1986), the Motorola 68851 (1984) used with the Motorola 68020 CPU in the Macintosh II, or the Z8015 (1985) used with the Zilog Z8000 family of processors. Later microprocessors (such as the Motorola 68030 and the Zilog Z280) placed the MMU together with the CPU on the same integrated circuit, as did the Intel 80286 and later x86 microprocessors. While this article concentrates on modern MMUs, commonly based on pages, early systems used a similar concept for base-limit addressing that further developed into segmentation. Those are occasionally also present on modern architectures. The x86 architecture provided segmentation, rather than paging, in the 80286, and provides both paging and segmentation in the 80386 and later processors (although the use of segmentation is not available in 64-bit operation). Examples Most modern systems divide memory into pages that are in size, often with the capability to use so called huge pages of or in size (often both variants are possible). Page translations are cached in a translation lookaside buffer (TLB). Some systems, mainly older RISC designs, trap into the OS when a page translation is not found in the TLB. Most systems use a hardware-based tree walker. Most systems allow the MMU to be disabled, but some disable the MMU when trapping into OS code. = VAX = VAX pages are 512 bytes, which is very small. An OS may treat multiple pages as if they were a single larger page. For example, Linux on VAX groups eight pages together. Thus, the system is viewed as having pages. The VAX divides memory into four fixed-purpose regions, each in size. They are: ;P0 space: Used for general- purpose per-process memory such as heaps. ;P1 space: (Or control space) which is also per-process and is typically used for supervisor, executive, kernel, user stacks and other per-process control structures managed by the operating system. ;S0 space: (Or system space) which is global to all processes and stores operating system code and data, whether paged or not, including pagetables. ;S1 space: Which is unused and \\"Reserved to Digital\\". Page tables are big linear arrays. Normally, this would be very wasteful when addresses are used at both ends of the possible range, but the page table for applications is itself stored in the kernel's paged memory. Thus, there is effectively a two-level tree, allowing applications to have sparse memory layout without wasting a lot of space on unused page table entries. The VAX MMU is notable for lacking an accessed bit. OSes which implement paging must find some way to emulate the accessed bit if they are to operate efficiently. Typically, the OS will periodically unmap pages so that page-not-present faults can be used to let the OS set an accessed bit. = ARM = ARM architecture-based application processors implement an MMU defined by ARM's virtual memory system architecture. The current architecture defines PTEs for describing and pages, sections and super-sections; legacy versions also defined a tiny page. ARM uses a two-level page table if using and pages, or just a one-level page table for sections and sections. TLB updates are performed automatically by page table walking hardware. PTEs include read/write access permission based on privilege, cacheability information, an NX bit, and a non-secure bit. = IBM System/360 Model 67, IBM System/370, and successors = The IBM System/360 Model 67, which was introduced Aug. 1965, included an MMU called a dynamic address translation (DAT) box. It has the unusual feature of storing accessed and dirty bits outside of the page table (along with the four bit protection key for all S/360 processors). They refer to physical memory rather than virtual memory, and are accessed by special- purpose instructions. This reduces overhead for the OS, which would otherwise need to propagate accessed and dirty bits from the page tables to a more physically oriented data structure. This makes OS-level virtualization, later called paravirtualization, easier. Starting in August, 1972, the IBM System/370 has a similar MMU, although it initially supported only a 24-bit virtual address space rather than the 32-bit virtual address space of the System/360 Model 67. It also stores the accessed and dirty bits outside the page table. In early 1983, the System/370-XA architecture expanded the virtual address space to 31 bits, and in 2000, the 64-bit z/Architecture was introduced, with the address space expanded to 64 bits; those continue to store the accessed and dirty bits outside the page table. = DEC Alpha = The DEC Alpha processor divides memory into pages. After a TLB miss, low-level firmware machine code (here called PALcode) walks a three-level tree- structured page table. Addresses are broken down as follows: 21 bits unused, 10 bits to index the root level of the tree, 10 bits to index the middle level of the tree, 10 bits to index the leaf level of the tree, and 13 bits that pass through to the physical address without modification. Full read/write/execute permission bits are supported. =MIPS= The MIPS architecture supports one to 64 entries in the TLB. The number of TLB entries is configurable at CPU configuration before synthesis. TLB entries are dual. Each TLB entry maps a virtual page number (VPN2) to either one of two page frame numbers (PFN0 or PFN1), depending on the least significant bit of the virtual address that is not part of the page mask. This bit and the page mask bits are not stored in the VPN2. Each TLB entry has its own page size, which can be any value from to in multiples of four. Each PFN in a TLB entry has a caching attribute, a dirty and a valid status bit. A VPN2 has a global status bit and an OS assigned ID which participates in the virtual address TLB entry match, if the global status bit is set to zero. A PFN stores the physical address without the page mask bits. A TLB refill exception is generated when there are no entries in the TLB that match the mapped virtual address. A TLB invalid exception is generated when there is a match but the entry is marked invalid. A TLB modified exception is generated when a store instruction references a mapped address and the matching entry's dirty status is not set. If a TLB exception occurs when processing a TLB exception, a double fault TLB exception, it is dispatched to its own exception handler. MIPS32 and MIPS32r2 support 32 bits of virtual address space and up to 36 bits of physical address space. MIPS64 supports up to 64 bits of virtual address space and up to 59 bits of physical address space. =Sun 1= The original Sun 1 is a single- board computer built around the Motorola 68000 microprocessor and introduced in 1982. It includes the original Sun 1 memory management unit that provides address translation, memory protection, memory sharing and memory allocation for multiple processes running on the CPU. All access of the CPU to private on-board RAM, external Multibus memory, on-board I/O and the Multibus I/O runs through the MMU, where address translation and protection are done in a uniform fashion. The MMU is implemented in hardware on the CPU board. The MMU consists of a context register, a segment map and a page map. Virtual addresses from the CPU are translated into intermediate addresses by the segment map, which in turn are translated into physical addresses by the page map. The page size is and the segment size is which gives 16 pages per segment. Up to 16 contexts can be mapped concurrently. The maximum logical address space for a context is or The maximum physical address that can be mapped simultaneously is also The context register is important in a multitasking operating system because it allows the CPU to switch between processes without reloading all the translation state information. The 4-bit context register can switch between 16 sections of the segment map under supervisor control, which allows 16 contexts to be mapped concurrently. Each context has its own virtual address space. Sharing of virtual address space and inter-context communications can be provided by writing the same values in to the segment or page maps of different contexts. Additional contexts can be handled by treating the segment map as a context cache and replacing out-of- date contexts on a least-recently used basis. The context register makes no distinction between user and supervisor states. Interrupts and traps do not switch contexts, which requires that all valid interrupt vectors always be mapped in page 0 of context, as well as the valid supervisor stack.Sun 68000 Board User's Manual, Sun Microsystems, Inc, February 1983, Revision B = PowerPC = In PowerPC G1, G2, G3, and G4 pages are normally After a TLB miss, the standard PowerPC MMU begins two simultaneous lookups. One lookup attempts to match the address with one of four or eight data block address translation (DBAT) registers, or four or eight instruction block address translation registers (IBAT), as appropriate. The BAT registers can map linear chunks of memory as large as and are normally used by an OS to map large portions of the address space for the OS kernel's own use. If the BAT lookup succeeds, the other lookup is halted and ignored. The other lookup, not directly supported by all processors in this family, is via a so-called \\"inverted page table,\\" which acts as a hashed off-chip extension of the TLB. First, the top four bits of the address are used to select one of 16 segment registers. Then 24 bits from the segment register replace those four bits, producing a 52-bit address. The use of segment registers allows multiple processes to share the same hash table. The 52-bit address is hashed, then used as an index into the off-chip table. There, a group of eight-page table entries is scanned for one that matches. If none match due to excessive hash collisions, the processor tries again with a slightly different hash function. If this, too, fails, the CPU traps into OS (with MMU disabled) so that the problem may be resolved. The OS needs to discard an entry from the hash table to make space for a new entry. The OS may generate the new entry from a more-normal tree-like page table or from per-mapping data structures which are likely to be slower and more space- efficient. Support for no-execute control is in the segment registers, leading to granularity. A major problem with this design is poor cache locality caused by the hash function. Tree-based designs avoid this by placing the page table entries for adjacent pages in adjacent locations. An operating system running on the PowerPC may minimize the size of the hash table to reduce this problem. It is also somewhat slow to remove the page table entries of a process. The OS may avoid reusing segment values to delay facing this, or it may elect to suffer the waste of memory associated with per-process hash tables. G1 chips do not search for page table entries, but they do generate the hash, with the expectation that an OS will search the standard hash table via software. The OS can write to the TLB. G2, G3, and early G4 chips use hardware to search the hash table. The latest chips allow the OS to choose either method. On chips that make this optional or do not support it at all, the OS may choose to use a tree-based page table exclusively. = IA-32 / x86 = The x86 architecture has evolved over a very long time while maintaining full software compatibility, even for OS code. Thus, the MMU is extremely complex, with many different possible operating modes. Normal operation of the traditional 80386 CPU and its successors (IA-32) is described here. The CPU primarily divides memory into pages. Segment registers, fundamental to the older 8088 and 80286 MMU designs, are not used in modern OSes, with one major exception: access to thread-specific data for applications or CPU-specific data for OS kernels, which is done with explicit use of the FS and GS segment registers. All memory access involves a segment register, chosen according to the code being executed. The segment register acts as an index into a table, which provides an offset to be added to the virtual address. Except when using FS or GS, the OS ensures that the offset will be zero. After the offset is added, the address is masked to be no larger than 32 bits. The result may be looked up via a tree-structured page table, with the bits of the address being split as follows: 10 bits for the branch of the tree, 10 bits for the leaves of the branch, and the 12 lowest bits being directly copied to the result. Some operating systems, such as OpenBSD with its W^X feature, and Linux with the Exec Shield or PaX patches, may also limit the length of the code segment, as specified by the CS register, to disallow execution of code in modifiable regions of the address space. Minor revisions of the MMU introduced with the Pentium have allowed very large pages by skipping the bottom level of the tree (this leaves 10 bits for indexing the first level of page hierarchy with the remaining 10+12 bits being directly copied to the result). Minor revisions of the MMU introduced with the Pentium Pro introduced the physical address extension (PAE) feature, enabling 36-bit physical addresses with 2+9+9 bits for three-level page tables and 12 lowest bits being directly copied to the result. Large pages () are also available by skipping the bottom level of the tree (resulting in 2+9 bits for two-level table hierarchy and the remaining 9+12 lowest bits copied directly). In addition, the page attribute table allowed specification of cacheability by looking up a few high bits in a small on-CPU table. No-execute support was originally only provided on a per-segment basis, making it very awkward to use. More recent x86 chips provide a per-page no-execute bit in the PAE mode. The W^X, Exec Shield, and PaX mechanisms described above emulate per-page non-execute support on machines x86 processors lacking the NX bit by setting the length of the code segment, with a performance loss and a reduction in the available address space. = x86-64 = Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) creates a unified virtual address space for CPUs, GPUs and DSPs, obsoleting the mapping tricks and data copying. x86-64 is a 64-bit extension of x86 that almost entirely removes segmentation in favor of the flat memory model used by almost all operating systems for the 386 or newer processors. In long mode, all segment offsets are ignored, except for the FS and GS segments. When used with pages, the page table tree has four levels instead of three. The virtual addresses are divided as follows: 16 bits unused, nine bits each for four tree levels (for a total of 36 bits), and the 12 lowest bits directly copied to the result. With pages, there are only three levels of page table, for a total of 27 bits used in paging and 21 bits of offset. Some newer CPUs also support a page with two levels of paging and of offset. CPUID can be used to determine if pages are supported. In all three cases, the bits are required to be equal to the 48th bit, or in other words, the low are sign extended to the higher bits. This is done to allow a future expansion of the addressable range, without compromising backwards compatibility. In all levels of the page table, the page table entry includes a no-execute bit. = Unisys MCP Systems (Burroughs B5000) = The Burroughs B5000 from 1961 was the first commercial system to support virtual memory (after the Atlas), even though it has no MMU It provides the two functions of an MMU - virtual memory addresses and memory protection - with a different architectural approach. First, in the mapping of virtual memory addresses, instead of needing an MMU, the MCP systems are descriptor-based. Each allocated memory block is given a master descriptor with the properties of the block (i.e., the size, address, and whether present in memory). When a request is made to access the block for reading or writing, the hardware checks its presence via the presence bit (pbit) in the descriptor. A pbit of 1 indicates the presence of the block. In this case, the block can be accessed via the physical address in the descriptor. If the pbit is zero, an interrupt is generated for the MCP (operating system) to make the block present. If the address field is zero, this is the first access to this block, and it is allocated (an init pbit). If the address field is non-zero, it is a disk address of the block, which has previously been rolled out, so the block is fetched from disk and the pbit is set to one and the physical memory address updated to point to the block in memory (another pbit). This makes descriptors equivalent to a page-table entry in an MMU system. System performance can be monitored through the number of pbits. Init pbits indicate initial allocations, but a high level of other pbits indicate that the system may be thrashing. All memory allocation is therefore completely automatic (one of the features of modern systems ) and there is no way to allocate blocks other than this mechanism. There are no such calls as malloc or dealloc, since memory blocks are also automatically discarded. The scheme is also lazy, since a block will not be allocated until it is actually referenced. When memory is nearly full, the MCP examines the working set, trying compaction (since the system is segmented, not paged), deallocating read-only segments (such as code-segments which can be restored from their original copy) and, as a last resort, rolling dirty data segments out to disk. Another way the B5000 provides a function of a MMU is in protection. Since all accesses are via the descriptor, the hardware can check that all accesses are within bounds and, in the case of a write, that the process has write permission. The MCP system is inherently secure and thus has no need of an MMU to provide this level of memory protection. Descriptors are read only to user processes and may only be updated by the system (hardware or MCP). (Words whose tag is an odd number are read-only; descriptors have a tag of 5 and code words have a tag of 3.) Blocks can be shared between processes via copy descriptors in the process stack. Thus, some processes may have write permission, whereas others do not. A code segment is read only, thus reentrant and shared between processes. Copy descriptors contain a 20-bit address field giving index of the master descriptor in the master descriptor array. This also implements a very efficient and secure IPC mechanism. Blocks can easily be relocated, since only the master descriptor needs update when a block's status changes. The only other aspect is performance do MMU-based or non-MMU-based systems provide better performance? MCP systems may be implemented on top of standard hardware that does have an MMU (for example, a standard PC). Even if the system implementation uses the MMU in some way, this will not be at all visible at the MCP level.

It is the first model of the Macintosh II family, and the first Macintosh to support a color display. When first introduced, a basic system with 20 MB drive and monitor cost . With a 13-inch color monitor and 8-bit display card the price was around . This price placed it in competition with workstations from Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard. The Macintosh II was designed by hardware engineers Michael Dhuey (computer) and Brian Berkeley (monitor) and industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger (case). Eighteen months after its introduction, the Macintosh II was updated with a more powerful CPU and sold as the Macintosh IIx. In early 1989, the more compact Macintosh IIcx was introduced at a price similar to the original Macintosh II, and by the beginning of 1990 sales stopped altogether. Motherboard upgrades to turn a Macintosh II into a IIx or Macintosh IIfx were offered by Apple.  Overview  Two common criticisms of the Macintosh from its introduction in 1984 were the closed architecture and lack of color; rumors of a color Macintosh began almost immediately. The Macintosh II project was begun by Dhuey and Berkeley during 1985 without the knowledge of Apple co-founder and Macintosh division head Steve Jobs, who opposed features like expansion slots and color, on the basis that the former complicated the user experience and the latter did not conform to WYSIWYG, since color printers were not common. He instead wanted higher-resolution monochrome displays for the Macintosh. Initially referred to as \\"Little Big Mac\\", the Macintosh II was codenamed \\"Milwaukee\\" after Dhuey's hometown, and later went through a series of new names, including \\"Reno\\", \\"Becks\\", \\"Cabernet\\", \\"Uzi\\" and \\"Paris\\" (after Jean-Louis Gass√©e, Apple's then products manager, who protected the semi-clandestine project from cancellation).Levy, Steven. Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything. New York: Viking, 1994; p. 229-231 After Jobs was fired from Apple in September 1985, the project could proceed openly. The Macintosh II was introduced at the AppleWorld 1987 conference in Los Angeles, with low- volume initial shipments starting two months later. Retailing for US $5,498, the Macintosh II was the first \\"modular\\" Macintosh model, so called because it came in a horizontal desktop case like many IBM PC compatibles of the time. All previous Macintosh computers used an all-in-one design with a built-in black-and-white CRT. The Macintosh II had drive bays for an internal hard disk (originally 40 MB or 80 MB) and an optional second floppy disk drive. It, along with the Macintosh SE, was the first Macintosh computer to use the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) introduced with the Apple IIGS for keyboard and mouse interface. The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were an ability to handle any display size, up to 8-bit color depth, and multiple monitors. Because Color QuickDraw was included in the Macintosh II's ROM and relied on new 68020 instructions, earlier Macintoshes could not be upgraded to display color. In September 1988, shortly before the introduction of the Macintosh IIx, Apple increased the list price of the Macintosh II by about 20%.  Hardware  A Macintosh II motherboard CPU: The Macintosh II is built around the Motorola 68020 processor operating at 16 MHz, teamed with a Motorola 68881 floating point unit. The machine shipped with a socket for an MMU, but the \\"Apple HMMU Chip\\" (VLSI VI475 chip) was installed that did not implement virtual memory (instead, it translated 24-bit addresses to 32-bit addresses for the Mac OS, which would not be 32-bit clean until System 7). Memory: The standard memory was 1 megabyte, expandable to 8 MB.Apple Announces 68030 Macintosh IIx With High Density Compatible Drive by John Cook and Carol Cochrane, Business Wire 09/19/88 (retrieved September 20, 2009) The Mac II had eight 30-pin SIMMs, and memory was installed in groups of four (called \\"Bank A\\" and \\"Bank B\\"). The original Macintosh II did not have a PMMU by default. It relied on the memory controller hardware to map the installed memory into a contiguous address space. This hardware had the restriction that the address space dedicated to bank A must be larger than those of bank B. Though this memory controller was designed to support up to 16MB 30-pin SIMMs for up to 128MB of RAM, the original Macintosh II ROMs had problems limiting the amount of RAM that can be installed to 8MB. The Macintosh IIx ROMs that also shipped with the FDHD upgrade fixed this problem, though still do not have a 32-bit Memory Manager and cannot boot into 32-bit addressing mode under Mac OS (without the assistance of MODE32).Series: The 24-bit ROM Blues by Adam C. Engst, Tidbits, April 22, 1991 (retrieved September 21, 2009) MODE32 contained a workaround that allowed larger SIMMs to be put in Bank B with the PMMU installed. In this case, the ROMs at boot think that the computer has 8MB or less of RAM. MODE32 then reprograms the memory controller to dedicate more address space to Bank A, allowing access to the additional memory in Bank B. Since this makes the physical address space discontiguous, the PMMU is then used to remap the address space into a contiguous block. Graphics: The Macintosh II includes a graphics card that supports a true-color 16.7 million color palette and was available in two configurations: 4-bit and 8-bit. The 4-bit model supports 16 colors on a 640√ó480 display and 256 colors (8-bit video) on a 512√ó384 display, which means that VRAM was 256 KB. The 8-bit model supports 256-color video on a 640√ó480 display, which means that VRAM was 512 KB in size. With an optional RAM upgrade (requiring 120ns DIP chips), the 4-bit version supports 640√ó480 in 8-bit color. The video card does not include hardware acceleration of drawing operations. Display: Apple offered a choice of two displays, a 12\\" black and white unit, and a more expensive 13\\" high- resolution color display based on Sony's Trinitron technology. More than one display could be attached to the computer, and objects could be easily dragged from one screen to the next. Third-party displays quickly became available. The Los Angeles Times reviewer called the color \\"spectacular.\\" The operating system user interface remained black and white even on color monitors with the exception of the Apple logo, which appeared in rainbow color. Storage: A 5.25-inch 40 MB internal SCSI hard disk was optional, as was a second internal 800 kilobyte 3.5-inch floppy disk drive. Expansion: Six NuBus slots were available for expansion (at least one of which had to be used for a graphics card, as the Mac II had no onboard graphics chipset and the OS didn't support headless booting). It is possible to connect as many as six displays to a Macintosh II by filling all of the NuBus slots with graphics cards. Another option for expansion included the Mac286, which included an Intel 80286 chip and could be used for MS-DOS compatibility. The original ROMs in the Macintosh II contained a bug that prevented the system from recognizing more than one megabyte of memory address space on a Nubus card. Every Macintosh II manufactured until approximately November 1987 had this defect. This happened because Slot Manager was not 32-bit clean.InfoWorld Magazine, October 26, 1987, p.47 Apple offered a well-publicized recall of the faulty ROMs and released a program to test whether a particular Macintosh II had the defect. As a result, it is rare to find a Macintosh II with the original ROMs. Accessories: The Macintosh II and Macintosh SE were the first Apple computers since the Apple I to be sold without a keyboard. Instead the customer was offered the choice of the new ADB Apple Keyboard or the Apple Extended Keyboard as a separate purchase. Dealers could bundle a third-party keyboard or attempt to upsell a customer to the more expensive (and higher-profit) Extended Keyboard. Audio: The Macintosh II was the first Macintosh to have the Chimes of Death accompany the Sad Mac logo whenever a serious hardware error occurred. The new extensions featured for the Macintosh II at the time were A/ROSE and Sound Manager.  Models  The Macintosh II was offered in three configurations. All systems included a mouse and a single 800 KB 3.5-inch floppy disk drive; a 68551 PMMU was available as an option. * Macintosh II CPU: 1 MB RAM. * Macintosh II 1/40 CPU: 1 MB RAM, internal 40-megabyte SCSI HDD. * Macintosh II 4/40 CPU: 4 MB RAM, internal 40-megabyte SCSI HDD.

At the top of the image is the camera's view; the cubes stay the same size as the teapots in the background grow bigger. At the bottom of the image is a plan view showing the camera moving back while zooming in, illustrating how the effect is achieved. In the video inset, the object moves with the camera and it does not zoom, so the FOV does not change; thus there is no dolly effect A dolly zoom (also known as a Hitchcock shot, Jaws effect, Vertigo shot, or Zolly shot) is an in-camera effect that appears to undermine normal visual perception. The effect is achieved by zooming a zoom lens to adjust the angle of view (often referred to as field of view, or FOV) while the camera dollies (moves) toward or away from the subject in such a way as to keep the subject the same size in the frame throughout. In its classic form, the camera angle is pulled away from a subject while the lens zooms in, or vice versa. Thus, during the zoom, there is a continuous perspective distortion, the most directly noticeable feature being that the background appears to change size relative to the subject. The visual appearance for the viewer is that either the background suddenly grows in size and detail and overwhelms the foreground, or the foreground becomes immense and dominates its previous setting, depending on which way the dolly zoom is executed. As the human visual system uses both size and perspective cues to judge the relative sizes of objects, seeing a perspective change without a size change is a highly unsettling effect, often with strong emotional impact. Background The effect was first conceived by Irmin Roberts, a Paramount second-unit cameraman, in Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. The shot has since been used in many other films, including Goodfellas,This Is How A Dolly Zoom Works-Fandor on YouTube Jaws, and the Lord of the Rings films. Rainer Werner Fassbinder uses the effect twice in one shot in Chinese Roulette (1976). The dolly zoom is commonly used by filmmakers to represent the sensation of vertigo, a \\"falling-away-from-oneself feeling\\" or a feeling of unreality, or to suggest that a character is undergoing a realization that causes them to reassess everything they had previously believed. Alfred Hitchcock popularized the effect, and he used it for a climactic revelation in Vertigo.  Optics  For most purposes, it can be assumed that the image space and the object space are in the same medium. Thus, for an object in focus, the distance between the lens and image plane s_\\\\text{i}, the distance between lens and the object s_\\\\text{o}, and the focal length f are related by :{1 \\\\over s_i} + {1 \\\\over s_o} = {1 \\\\over f}. Then the transverse magnification is :M = {s_\\\\text{i} \\\\over s_\\\\text{o}} = {f \\\\over (s_\\\\text{o} - f)}. The axial magnification M_\\\\text{ax} of an object at s_\\\\text{o} is the rate of change of the lens‚Äìimage distance s_\\\\text{i} as the lens‚Äìobject distance s_\\\\text{o} changes. For an object of finite depth, one can conceive of the average axial magnification as the ratio of the depth of the image and the depth of the object: :M_\\\\text{ax} = \\\\left {d \\\\over d(s_\\\\text{o})} {s_\\\\text{i} \\\\over s_\\\\text{o}} \\\\right = \\\\left {d \\\\over d(s_\\\\text{o})} {f \\\\over (s_\\\\text{o} - f)} \\\\right = \\\\left {-f \\\\over (s_\\\\text{o} - f)^2} \\\\right = {M^2 \\\\over f}. One can see that if magnification remains constant, a longer focal length results in a smaller axial magnification, and a smaller focal length in a larger axial magnification. That is, when using a longer focal length while moving the camera/lens away from the object to maintain the same magnification M, objects seem shallower, and the axial distances between objects seem shorter. The opposite‚Äîincreased axial magnification‚Äîhappens with shorter focal lengths while moving the camera/lens towards the object. =Calculating distances= To achieve the effect, the camera needs to be positioned at a certain distance from the object that is supposed to remain still during the dolly zoom. The distance depends on how wide the scene is to be filmed and on the field of view (FOV) of the camera lens. Before calculating the distances needed at the different fields of view, the constant width of the scene has to be calculated: : \\\\text{distance} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{width}}{2\\\\tan\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\text{FOV}\\\\right)}. For example, a FOV of 90¬∞ and a distance of 2 meters yield a constant width of 4 meters, allowing a 4-meter-wide object to remain still inside the frame during the effect.

The western bridge carries traffic to the north and the eastern bridge carries traffic to the south. They are the most eastern crossing of the Brisbane River, the closest to Moreton Bay, crossing at the Quarries Reach, between Eagle Farm and Murarrie. The original bridge (formerly named the Gateway Bridge) was opened on 11 January 1986 and cost A$92 million to build. The duplicate bridge was opened in May 2010, and cost $350 million. On 16 May 2010 the Queensland Government renamed the Gateway Bridge and its duplicate the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges. An opinion poll conducted by Brisbane's Channel Nine News, showed 97% of people were against the decision to rename the bridge and most people still call it the Gateway Bridge.Channel Nine News, 12 February 2010 A public open day for the duplicate bridge was held on 16 May and the new bridge was opened to traffic on 22 May 2010, six months ahead of schedule. Following the opening, the old bridge was refurbished, three vehicle lanes at a time. From November 2010 the two bridges carry 12 lanes of vehicle traffic (six in each direction).Channel Seven News, 13 February 2010 The associated upgrade of the Gateway Motorway south of the bridge was completed in May 2010 to coincide with the new bridge opening. The bridge is tolled using the Linkt (formerly go via) electronic system and will remain so until 2041. The toll booths were removed and free flow tolling began in July 2009. The booth removal saw an immediate drop in road crashes due to the reduction in queuing and weaving at the toll booths on the southern approach. History Gateway Bridge Construction Gateway Bridge Construction Construction on the Gateway Bridge commenced on 5 June 1980\\\\. The construction of the bridge started before the design was completed, to fast track its construction. It was officially commissioned on 11 January 1986. On this day 200,000 people crossed the bridge by foot as part of the opening activities. In 1986 the bridge carried an average of 12,500 vehicles per day. In 2001 the bridge was crossed by 27 million vehicles (approximately 73,975 vehicles per day). In early 2010 the single bridge was carrying an average of 100,000 vehicles per day. The annual Bridge to Brisbane fun run has begun from the southern entrance to the bridge for the past decade. Design In 1979 a tender was called by the Queensland Main Roads Department for a new bridge crossing of the Brisbane River. The conforming design main span was designed as a balanced cantilever with two raised post tensioned concrete compression stays located on the median and over each of the two main piers to support the 260 metre span. Due to the proximity of the Brisbane Airport, an overall structural height constraint was provided due to aircraft flight path and clearances. This constraint ruled out the possibility of a conventional cable- stayed bridge due to the height of the pylons that would be required. Due to cost considerations an alternative design concept was proposed by Bruce Ramsay (Manager Engineering) of VSL. This alternative design required a world record main span of 260m for a free cantilever, concrete box girder bridge. The concept was adopted by one of the tenderers ‚Äî Transfield Queensland Pty.Ltd. who were subsequently awarded the project on the basis of this alternative. It held the record span of 260m for over 15 years. The box girder is still the largest prestressed concrete, single box in the world, measuring 15m deep at the pier, with a box width of 12m and an overall deck width for the six lanes of 22m. As stated above the bridge owes its distinctive shape to air traffic requirements restricting its height to under above sea level (all features of the bridge including light poles) coupled with shipping needs requiring a navigational clearance of . The bridge has six lanes (originally three lanes in each direction, which were subsequently reconfigured to six lanes of northbound traffic after opening of the duplicate bridge). The bridge was financed by funds borrowed by the Queensland Government, and as a result, users of the bridge pay a toll when crossing the bridge in either direction. The bridge is operated and maintained by Queensland Motorways, which is a Queensland Government-owned enterprise. The total length is 1,627 metres (5,337 ft). This is divided into a southern approach of 376 metres (1,234 ft), a northern approach of 731 metres (2,398 ft) and the three central spans of 520 metres (1,706 ft). The record main span is 260 metres (853 ft) long by 64.5 metres (212 ft) high, which is equivalent to a 20-storey building. A total of 150,000 tonnes (165,000 short tons) of concrete was used to construct the bridge. The original design did not include a safety fence to prevent suicide attempts and base jumping. Three-metre high safety fences attached to the top of the concrete traffic barrier were later installed to prevent these incidents occurring. Anti-climbing screens are part of the second bridge's security features. Duplication Gateway Bridges from south bank of Brisbane River (Rivergate Marina) Park and pathway on south side In 2005, a major upgrade of the Gateway Motorway was announced. Leighton Contractors and joint venture partner Abigroup won the contract to upgrade the motorway. The A$1.88 billion Gateway Upgrade Project includes the duplication of the Gateway Bridge and upgrades to of the Gateway Motorway from Mt Gravatt-Capalaba Road in the south to Nudgee Road in the north. The bridge duplication was the largest bridge and road development in Queensland's history. The duplicate bridge was specified to have a design life of 300 years. To the south, the upgrade included widening of the Gateway Motorway from 4 to 6 lanes. To the north, it involved the construction of the Gateway Motorway deviation, an entirely new six-lane motorway between the Gateway Bridge and Nudgee Road. The deviation runs east of the original motorway through Brisbane Airport Corporation land and provides an alternative means of access to Brisbane Airport (the only effective access from the south). The new bridge provides a bicycle path unlike the first crossing. The Wynnum Road upgrade was completed on 13 July 2007 and 2 additional southbound lanes between the Port of Brisbane Motorway and Wynnum Road completed in late 2007. Four of six lanes of the new Gateway Motorway deviation were opened in July 2009\\\\. All works south of the river were complete by the end of 2009 after 10 years of constant roadwork and traffic disruption. The final concrete pour linking the sides of the new bridge was made in late October 2009. A total of 748 concrete segments, which are supported by 17 piers, were placed for the new bridge. The duplicate bridge was completed in May 2010 along with the remaining lanes of the Gateway Motorway deviation. In October 2010, then Minister for Main Roads, Craig Wallace, announced that the original course of the Gateway Motorway via Eagle Farm would be renamed to Southern Cross Way, after Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's aircraft, the Southern Cross, which landed at Eagle Farm in 1928, and so as to avoid confusion with the newly opened Gateway Motorway deviation. The new Gateway Motorway deviation was given the name Gateway Motorway. However, like the renaming of the bridges themselves, the change to Southern Cross Way was not without controversy, attracting criticism from the then Shadow Minister for Main Roads and Transport, Fiona Simpson. Refurbishment of the existing bridge was completed in November 2010.  Awards  In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Gateway Bridge was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"structure and engineering feat\\".

It is the longest cantilever bridge in Australia. The road across the bridge is named Bradfield Highway. The bridge connects Fortitude Valley to Kangaroo Point. The Story Bridge opened in 1940 and was tolled until 1947. It is named after prominent public servant John Douglas Story. History Given the early settlement of Kangaroo Point, there is a long history of residents wanting a bridge between the Brisbane CBD and Kangaroo Point. Even while the first Victoria Bridge was being constructed between North Brisbane and South Brisbane in 1865, several hundred people were petitioning for a second bridge to be built from the Customs House to Kangaroo Point. In 1888, a meeting was held in the Brisbane Town Hall to demand a bridge connecting either George Street, Albert Street or Edward Street via the City Botanic Gardens with any loss of the land from the gardens to be potentially compensated by removing Government House. Panorama showing the location of the Story Bridge (left) relative to the Brisbane CBD. =Planning= A bridge downstream of the Victoria Bridge was part of a larger plan, devised by Professor Roger Hawken of the University of Queensland in the 1920s, for a series of bridges over the Brisbane River to alleviate congestion on Victoria Bridge and to divert traffic away from the Brisbane central business district. The William Jolly Bridge was the first of the Hawken Plan bridges to be constructed. Lack of funds precluded the construction of the downstream bridge at that time. Initially plans called for a transporter bridge further downstream near New Farm. In 1926 Kangaroo Point was recommended by the Brisbane City Council's Cross River Commission. Subsequently, the bridge was constructed as a public works program during the Great Depression. The cost was to be no more than ¬£1.6 million. Plans for the \\"Brisbane River Bridge\\", circa 1934 =Construction= The bridge under construction. Before the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 the Government of Queensland asked John Bradfield to design a new bridge in Brisbane. The Queensland Government appointed John Bradfield on 15 December 1933 as consulting engineer to the Bureau of Industry who were in charge of the construction of the bridge. In June 1934 Bradfield's recommendation of a steel cantilever bridge was approved. The design for the bridge was based heavily on that of the Jacques Cartier Bridge in Montreal, completed in 1930. On 30 April 1935 a consortium of two Queensland companies, Evans Deakin and Hornibrook Constructions, won the tender with a bid of ¬£1,150,000.'Story Bridge: Idea to Icon' by Michael Moy, published Alpha Orion Press, Brisbane, 2005Governor of Queensland Sir Leslie Orme Wilson and consulting engineer Bradfield inspecting the bridge, 7 July 1938Construction on the bridge began on 24 May 1935, with the first sod being turned by the then Premier of Queensland, William Forgan Smith. Components for the bridge were fabricated in a purpose-built factory at Rocklea. There are 1.25 million rivets (metal pins or bolts) in the Story Bridge. During its construction, work sometimes continued 24 hours per day. The bridge has only one pier on the northern bank but two piers on the lower southern bank, one to bear the weight (the main pier) and, further to the south, one to prevent the bridge from twisting (the anchor pier). There was no need for an anchor pier on the northern bank as the bridge was anchored into schist cliff face. The primary challenge in constructing the bridge was the southern foundations that went below ground level. It was not possible to excavate to that level as water from the level would rapidly seep in. So a pneumatic caisson technique had to be used. As men were working under pressures of up to 4 times normal air pressure, a decompression period of almost 2 hours was needed at the end of each shift to avoid the bends. An on- site air lock hospital successfully treated the 65 cases of the bends that occurred. On 28 October 1939 the gap between the two sides was closed. A concrete decking was then laid, covered by a Trinidad pitch topping. The bridge was painted and sodium lighting was installed. The bridge approaches were also prepared. Three men died during the construction of the bridge. On 22 November 1937, Hans James Zimmerman slipped and fell to the ground. On 7 February 1939, Alfred William Jackson fell from the bridge into the river. Although pulled from the water alive, he died 4 hours later in hospital without regaining consciousness. On 6 December 1939, Arthur McKay (Max) Wharton was hit by a piece of equipment on a nerve that made him faint, falling from the bridge to the water; 18 months earlier Wharton had been hailed as a hero for saving another worker from falling from the bridge. = Naming = Until it was completed, the bridge was known as the Jubilee Bridge in honour of King George V. It was opened on 6 July 1940 by Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, Governor of Queensland and named after John Douglas Story, a senior and influential public servant who had advocated strongly the bridge‚Äôs construction. Operations Time-lapse of Brisbane and Story Bridge Toll booth, 1941 The bridge carries an average of 97,000 vehicles each day. The Story Bridge carries three lanes of traffic in either direction as well as a shared pedestrian and cycle way flanking each side. The road on the bridge is called the Bradfield Highway. It is not to be confused with the Bradfield Highway that spans the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Initially a toll of sixpence (5 cents) was charged to use the bridge, with toll booths constructed at the southern end of the Bradfield Highway. The toll was removed in 1947. Between 1952 and 1969 trolley-buses operated by the Brisbane City Council used the bridge. Following completion of the bridge, an expressway was constructed on the southern side of the bridge (opened 18 May 1970),Leighton Holdings Newsletter , June 1970 and a tunnel/loop was constructed at Kemp Place on the northern side (completed 10 July 1972).Leighton Holdings Newsletter , August 1972 Maintenance Riverfestival at Story Bridge Story Bridge with the Brisbane skyline in the background. Resurfacing works were undertaken in 1994. The Story Bridge was closed to traffic from midnight of Friday 3 January 2014 until 5.30 a.m. Monday, 6 January 2014, for essential maintenance work of resurfacing all six lanes. Closure for maintenance occurred again from 9 p.m. Friday 27 April 2018 until 5 a.m. Monday 30 April 2018. Role in contemporary Brisbane The Story Bridge features prominently in the annual Riverfire display and is illuminated at night. In 1990 road traffic was halted so pedestrians could celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bridge's construction. The bridge was again closed to road traffic on 5 July 2015 to celebrate the 75th anniversary. The celebration attracted almost 75,000 visitors to the bridge who enjoyed food, drink and entertainment as they walked across lanes usually reserved for vehicles. Bridge climbs began in 2005 and have become a popular tourist attraction. A picture of the bridge featured on Brisbane Bitter. Suicides Similar to many large bridges such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, Brisbane's Story Bridge has become notorious as a suicide hotspot. Following two high-profile murder-suicides from the bridge in 2011 and 2012, Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk announced plans to install free telephones linked to suicide prevention hotlines. On 6 February 2013, Quirk announced plans to install a three-metre-high safety barrier. Overall the plan cost about $8.4 million and was completed in December 2015. Heritage listing The bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992. In 1988, the bridge received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Story Bridge was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"structure and engineering feat\\".

It was branded as part of the Microsoft Office suite from 1997 to 2003. Microsoft FrontPage has since been replaced by Microsoft Expression Web and SharePoint Designer, which were first released in December 2006 alongside Microsoft Office 2007, but these two products were also discontinued in favor of a web-based version of SharePoint Designer, as those three HTML editors were desktop applications. =History = FrontPage was initially created by Cambridge, Massachusetts company Vermeer Technologies, Incorporated, evidence of which can be easily spotted in file names and directories prefixed _vti_ in web sites created using FrontPage. Vermeer was acquired by Microsoft in January 1996 specifically so that Microsoft could add FrontPage to its product line-up allowing them to gain an advantage in the browser wars, as FrontPage was designed to create web pages for their own browser, Internet Explorer. As a \\"WYSIWYG\\" (What You See Is What You Get) editor, FrontPage is designed to hide the details of pages' HTML code from the user, making it possible for novices to create web pages and web sites easily. FrontPage's initial outing under the Microsoft name came in 1996 with the release of Windows NT 4.0 Server and its constituent Web server Internet Information Services 2.0. Bundled on CD with the NT 4.0 Server release, FrontPage 1.1 would run under NT 4.0 (Server or Workstation) or Windows 95. Up to FrontPage 98, the FrontPage Editor, which was used for designing pages, was a separate application from the FrontPage Explorer which was used to manage web site folders.FrontPage Versions and Timeline With FrontPage 2000, both programs were merged into the Editor. FrontPage used to require a set of server-side plugins originally known as IIS Extensions. The extension set was significantly enhanced for Microsoft inclusion of FrontPage into the Microsoft Office line-up with Office 97 and subsequently renamed FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE). Both sets of extensions needed to be installed on the target web server for its content and publishing features to work. Microsoft offered both Windows and Unix-based versions of FPSE. FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions worked with earlier versions of FrontPage as well. FPSE 2002 was the last released version which also works with FrontPage 2003 and was later updated for IIS 6.0 as well. However, with FrontPage 2003, Microsoft began moving away from proprietary Server Extensions to standard protocols like FTP and WebDAV for remote web publishing and authoring. FrontPage 2003 can also be used with Windows SharePoint Services. A version for the classic Mac OS was released in 1998; however, it had fewer features than the Windows product and Microsoft has never updated it. In 2006, Microsoft announced that FrontPage would eventually be superseded by two products.http://www.microsoft.com/office/frontpage/prodinfo/futureoffp.mspx FrontPage 2003 Help and How-to microsoft.com Microsoft SharePoint Designer would allow business professionals to design SharePoint-based applications. Microsoft Expression Web is targeted at the web design professional for the creation of feature-rich web sites. Microsoft discontinued Microsoft FrontPage in December 2006. Features Some of the features in the last version of FrontPage include: *FrontPage 2003 consists of a Split View option to allow the user to code in Code View and preview in Design View without the hassle of switching from the Design and Code View tabs for each review. *Dynamic Web Templates (DWT) were included for the first time in FrontPage 2003 allowing users to create a single template that could be used across multiple pages and even the whole Web site. *Interactive Buttons give users a new easy way to create Web graphics for navigation and links, eliminating the need for a complicated image-editing package such as Adobe Photoshop which Microsoft does not sell. *The accessibility checker gives the user the ability to check if their code is standards-compliant and that their Web site is easily accessible for people with disabilities. An HTML optimizer is included to aid in optimizing code to make it legible and quicker to process. *Intellisense, which is a form of autocompletion, is a key feature in FrontPage 2003 that assists the user while typing in Code View. When working in Code View, Intellisense will suggest tags and/or properties for the code that the user is entering which was intended to significantly reduce the time to write code. The Quick Tag Editor shows the user the tag they are currently in when editing in Design View. This also includes the option to edit the specific tag/property from within the Tag Editor. *Code Snippets give users the advantage of creating snippets of their commonly used pieces of code allowing them to store it for easy access whenever it is next needed. *FrontPage 2003 includes support for programming in ASP.NET a server-side scripting language that adds interactivity to Web sites and Web pages. *FrontPage 2003 includes support for macros in VBA.

The Ferengi () are a fictional extraterrestrial species in the American science fiction franchise Star Trek. They were devised in 1987 for the series Star Trek: The Next Generation before being used in the subsequent series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek: Voyager. When launching Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987, Gene Roddenberry and the show's writers decided to introduce a new alien species to serve as antagonists for the crew of the USS Enterprise-D. The Ferengi first appeared in \\"The Last Outpost\\", the show's fourth episode, which was set in the year 2364. The writers decided that the Ferengi ultimately failed to appear sufficiently menacing, instead replacing them with the Romulans and Borg as primary antagonists. Throughout the rest of the series, Ferengi characters were primarily used for comedic effect. When creating Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the show's writers decided to introduce the Ferengi bartender Quark (Armin Shimerman)‚Äîand subsequently his brother Rom (Max Grod√©nchik) and nephew Nog (Aron Eisenberg)‚Äîas recurring characters, again largely using them for comedic purposes. Ferengi characters were subsequently utilised in a single episode of Star Trek: Enterprise and a few times in Star Trek: Voyager. Deep Space Nine writers have described how they saw the Ferengi as a satirical presentation of 20th century humans. Critics have drawn comparisons between the Ferengi and anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews, while the originators have stated multiple times that they intended the Ferengi to represent Americans and greed. Name The name Ferengi was coined based on the Persian term Ferenghi, used throughout Asia (compare older Feringhee), meaning \\"foreigners\\" or \\"Europeans\\".Star Trek writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe: \\"Ferengi is, after all, the Persian word for foreigner, particularly for European.\\" (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 114) It is derived from the ethnonym \\"Frank\\". History =Star Trek: The Next Generation= While preparing scripts for the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the idea of the Ferengi was devised by Gene Roddenberry and Herbert Wright. The new alien species initially appeared in the first season's fourth episode, \\"The Last Outpost\\", which was based on a story by Richard Krzemien and a teleplay by Wright. In this story, the USS Enterprise-D‚Äîwhose crew are the main protagonists of the series‚Äîmakes first contact with the Ferengi while pursuing one of their vessels, which has stolen a T-9 energy converter. Both ships are immobilized over an unknown planet, leading both to send away parties to investigate, where they encounter each other. One of the actors who played a Ferengi in \\"The Last Outpost\\", Armin Shimerman, would go on to play a Ferengi again in the later episode \\"Peak Performance\\" before being cast as the Ferengi bartender Quark in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The Ferengi insignia designed for \\"The Last Outpost\\" by Okuda The Ferengi outfits designed for \\"The Last Outpost\\" featured fur wrap-arounds. As weapons, they were given blue whips that fired energy bolts when cracked; these were subsequently dropped from the series and not used in later depictions of the species. Mike Okuda designed the Ferengi insignia to present the idea of \\"dog eat dog\\". It was colored green because of that color's associations with greed, envy, and money. The Ferengi ship featured in the episode was designed by Andy Probert, who used a horseshoe crab on Wright's desk as inspiration, with the model then being constructed by Greg Jein. The Ferengi were reused for the season's ninth episode, \\"The Battle\\", based on a story by Larry Forrester that Wright converted into a teleplay. This episode was first aired in November 1987. In it, a Ferengi called DaiMon Bok gives the Enterprise Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) the derelict ship that the latter once captained, the Stargazer. Over the course of the episode, it is revealed that this is part of Bok's plan for vengeance, for he holds Picard responsible for the death of his son many years before. Forrester's first plot outline had featured various scenes aboard the Ferengi spaceship, but these did not make it into the episode. Series writer Rick Berman later noted that because of their \\"silliness quotient\\", the Ferengi became \\"a disappointment as a major adversary\\". For the second-season episode \\"Peak Performance\\", written by David Kemper and directed by Robert Scheerer, the USS-Enterprise-D is depicted encountering a hostile Ferengi ship while engaging in a practice exercise. The Ferengi uniform was revised for this episode, and new collar pips were added to designate their differing ranks. The season three episode \\"The Price\\", which was written by Hannah Louise Shearer, directed by Robert Scheerer, and first aired in November 1989, also included Ferengi characters. In it, two Ferengi delegates compete against their Federation counterparts to gain access to a newly discovered stable wormhole; later in the episode, it is revealed that the wormhole was not really stable and the Ferengi get stuck on the other side of it, in a distant part of the galaxy. \\"The Price\\" is the first episode in which a Ferengi starship was referred to as a \\"marauder\\". =Star Trek: Deep Space Nine= Armin Shimerman (left) played Quark; Max Grod√©nchik (right) played Rom When the writers were putting together the premise of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, they decided to introduce a recurring Ferengi character who could inhabit the Deep Space Nine space station which was used as the main setting for the show. The show's co-creator, Michael Piller, later noted that: \\"It was clear to me that having a Ferengi aboard Deep Space 9 would provide the show with instant humor and built-in conflict with the Federation guy in charge of the station\\". The show's creators developed the character of Quark, a Ferengi bartender who would, according to Piller, be \\"a constant thorn in the side of law and order, but who has a sense of humor about it. He'd be someone who could obviously throw lots of story dynamics into play.\\" Piller and the others consciously wanted to play the Quark character off against the station constable, Odo (Ren√© Auberjonois); according to Piller, \\"the idea of Odo and Quark being at loggerheads was there from day one\\". The inclusion of Nog as a Starfleet officer prompted discussions on electronic mailing lists devoted to Star Trek. Various commentators suggested that, given how Nog had behaved in previous episodes, it was surprising that Starfleet would take him on. They suggested that this might indicate that Starfleet had some form of affirmative action policy to benefit species not presently represented in Starfleet. Other online commentators argued that this viewpoint was racist, and that Nog would have been accepted as a Starfleet cadet because he was qualified, not because of his racial identity.  Attributes  =Biology= A cosplayer dressed as a Ferengi (left) with another dressed as a Bajoran The Ferengi were first designed by Andrew Probert and later refined and produced by Michael Westmore. The most prominent feature in Ferengi design is their large ear lobes, which carry sexual connotations. In both DS9 and TNG, Ferengi experience sexual stimulation when their lobes are rubbed ‚Äî an act called \\"oo-mox\\". Ferengi females allegedly have smaller lobes, but the only female Ferengi characters are Pel and Ishka. Betazoids are incapable of reading Ferengi emotions. Comparisons with anti-Semitic stereotypes A Ferengi mask, alongside one of the Borg Various critics have argued that the depiction of the Ferengi and their culture mirrors anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews, namely the love of profit and the over-sized facial features - in the case of the Ferengi, the ears. During the 1990s, this issue was discussed on electronic mailing lists devoted to the franchise, with some commentators arguing that there were parallels and others objecting to the comparison. In his 2007 critique of The Next Generation for the National Review, the commentator Jonah Goldberg described the Ferengi as \\"runaway capitalists with bullwhips who looked like a mix between Nazi caricatures of Jews and the original Nosferatu.\\" The scholar of religion Ross S. Kraemer wrote that \\"Ferengi religion seems almost a parody, perhaps of traditional Judaism.\\" He wrote that the 285 Rules of Acquisition bore similarities with the 613 Commandments of Judaism and that the Ferengi social restrictions on women mirrored Orthodox Judaism's restrictions on women studying the Torah. Historian Paul Sturtevant wrote in 2018 that not only are the Ferengi \\"extremely legalistic\\" and \\"defined by their greed\\", echoing common stereotypes of Jews, but the major Ferengi characters on Deep Space Nine were all played by Jewish actors. Ira Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe state on the Deep Space Nine DVD commentary that the Ferengi are meant to be 20th-century humans. \\"The Ferengi are us. That's the gag, the Ferengis are humans. They're more human than the humans on Star Trek because they are so screwed-up, and they are so dysfunctional. They're regular people. And that was the fun of that.\\" Shimerman also addressed the issue when asked at a question-and-answer session at a Star Trek convention. He stated that: :In America, people ask 'Do the Ferengi represent Jews?' In England, they ask 'Do the Ferengi represent the Irish?' In Australia, they ask if the Ferengi represent the Chinese[‚Ä¶] The Ferengi represent the outcast‚Ä¶ it's the person who lives among us that we don't fully understand. The name Ferengi is derived from a term used in much of Asia for \\"Europeans\\" (see \\"Name\\" paragraph).

It may be accompanied by feelings of giddiness, or wooziness, or having a sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. Balance is the result of several body systems working together: the visual system (eyes), vestibular system (ears) and proprioception (the body's sense of where it is in space). Degeneration or loss of function in any of these systems can lead to balance deficits. Signs and symptoms Cognitive dysfunction (disorientation) may occur with vestibular disorders. Cognitive deficits are not just spatial in nature, but also include non-spatial functions such as object recognition memory. Vestibular dysfunction has been shown to adversely affect processes of attention and increased demands of attention can worsen the postural sway associated with vestibular disorders. Recent MRI studies also show that humans with bilateral vestibular damage (damage to both inner ears) undergo atrophy of the hippocampus which correlates with their degree of impairment on spatial memory tasks. Causes Problems with balance can occur when there is a disruption in any of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. Abnormalities in balance function may indicate a wide range of pathologies from causes like inner ear disorders, low blood pressure, brain tumors, and brain injury including stroke. =Presyncope= Presyncope is a feeling of lightheadedness or simply feeling faint. Syncope, by contrast, is actually fainting. A circulatory system deficiency, such as low blood pressure, can contribute to a feeling of dizziness when one suddenly stands up. =Related to the ear= Causes of dizziness related to the ear are often characterized by vertigo (spinning) and nausea. Nystagmus (flickering of the eye, related to the Vestibulo-ocular reflex [VOR]) is often seen in patients with an acute peripheral cause of dizziness. *Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) ‚Äì The most common cause of vertigo. It is typically described as a brief, intense sensation of spinning that occurs when there are changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting out of bed in the morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced calcium crystals called otoconia, which are normally found in the utricle and saccule (the otolith organs) and are used to sense movement. If they fall from the utricle and become loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement and cause a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, causing a spinning sensation. Diagnosis The difficulty of making the right vestibular diagnosis is reflected in the fact that in some populations, more than one-third of the patients with a vestibular disease consult more than one physician ‚Äì in some cases up to more than fifteen. Treatment There are various options for treating balance disorders. One option includes treatment for a disease or disorder that may be contributing to the balance problem, such as ear infection, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's, neuromuscular conditions, acquired brain injury, cerebellar dysfunctions and/or ataxia, or some tumors, such as acoustic neuroma. Individual treatment will vary and will be based upon assessment results including symptoms, medical history, general health, and the results of medical tests. Additionally, tai chi may be a cost-effective method to prevent falls in the elderly. = Vestibular rehabilitation = Many types of balance disorders will require balance training, prescribed by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist. Physiotherapists often administer standardized outcome measures as part of their assessment in order to gain useful information and data about a patient's current status. Some standardized balance I assessments or outcome measures include but are not limited to the Functional Reach Test, Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance (CTSIB), Berg Balance Scale and/or Timed Up and Go The data and information collected can further help the physiotherapist develop an intervention program that is specific to the individual assessed. Intervention programs may include training activities that can be used to improve static and dynamic postural control, body alignment, weight distribution, ambulation, fall prevention and sensory function. =Bilateral vestibular loss= Dysequilibrium arising from bilateral loss of vestibular function ‚Äì such as can occur from ototoxic drugs such as gentamicin ‚Äì can also be treated with balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation) although the improvement is not likely to be full recovery. Research Scientists at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are working to understand the various balance disorders and the complex interactions between the labyrinth, other balance-sensing organs, and the brain. NIDCD scientists are studying eye movement to understand the changes that occur in aging, disease, and injury, as well as collecting data about eye movement and posture to improve diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders. They are also studying the effectiveness of certain exercises as a treatment option.National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders References Further reading  External links  Neurological disorders Diseases of the ear and mastoid process ","title":"Balance disorder"},{"id":"177128","title":"Siobhan Fahey"},{"id":"177138","text":"The Captain Cook Bridge is a road bridge that carries the Pacific Motorway across the Brisbane River in Brisbane, in the state of Queensland, Australia. It was built exclusively for vehicular traffic and was completed in late 1972. The bridge had its naming ceremony on 13 December 1972, with it opening in January/February 1973. A once only pedestrian walk event across the bridge happened shortly before it was opened to vehicular traffic on 21 January 1973, organised by the Rotary Club of Stones Corner.Old Brisbane Album thread on the Captain Cook Bridge opening event, with photo of official walk completion certificate Retrieved 2 February 2020 The bridge crosses at the South Brisbane Reach of the river, linking Gardens Point in the Brisbane central business district on the north side to Kangaroo Point and South Brisbane on the southside. Location and features The Captain Cook Bridge, as viewed from Kangaroo Point Cliffs. Captain Cook Bridge is constructed as a multispan, precast prestressed concrete free-cantilever bridge with drop-in mid-spans. Comprising a dual carriageway that creates two separate bridges, one for each direction of traffic, heading north‚Äìsouth over the Brisbane River. Each bridge carries four lanes of traffic in one direction and links the M3 Pacific Motorway to the M3 Riverside Expressway. It is the main route from the city's south into the Brisbane central business district. At the time of completion, the main span of held the world record for this type of structure for a period of three months, when it was superseded by the Harada Bridge in Japan with a span of . The structure is Queensland's busiest traffic bridge with more than one million vehicles crossing it weekly in 2007. Downstream from the Captain Cook Bridge is the Story Bridge, while the Goodwill Bridge is the next crossing upstream. Concerns were raised in 2007 about the structure's integrity after it was revealed that contractors who attached a gantry to the bridge had drilled numerous holes which had damaged steel reinforcement bars. After investigations were completed it was concluded that the damage was insignificant as only 57 vertical steel bars out of had been cut.

The bridge connects the South Bank Parklands in South Brisbane to Gardens Point in the Brisbane CBD. The Goodwill Bridge was opened on 21 October 2001 and takes its name from the Goodwill Games, which were held in Brisbane that year. The bridge does not carry any motorised traffic -- it is shared by pedestrians, cyclists and inline skaters. Structure Two main components of The Goodwill Bridge are the pavilion and the arch. The pavilion is located in the middle of the Brisbane River between the arch and the city approach. It is a fundamental component of the pedestrian and cycle bridge and supports one end of the arch. The arch is in length, wide and high and weighs . = Specifications = * Width: * Height: Clearance for River Vessels from high water level to the bridge deck (same height as Victoria and Captain Cook bridges) * Arch: in length, wide and high * Bridge Deck: The bridge deck wearing surface is concrete with a broom finish to provide a safe foothold.

On completion barges floated the arch upstream at low tide it was floated under the Captain Cook Bridge and then lifted as a single structure into its final resting position by two heavy lift towers. Four strategically positioned platforms and the pavilion-viewing platform provide rest points for pedestrians and cyclists. With exception of cables, all materials utilised in the construction of the arch and the pavilions were sourced from local suppliers. Controversy arose during the construction of the bridge over its growing cost, and a subsequent budgetary blow-out which resulted in the use of $20.3 million in government funds. The bridge was scheduled to be opened by Queen Elizabeth II during her visit for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting summit to be held in Brisbane, but after the postponement of that meeting and change of venue to Coolum on the Sunshine Coast in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the bridge was instead opened by Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie. Usage The Goodwill Bridge connects the South Bank Parklands to Gardens Point. Over 40,000 pedestrians and cyclists utilise the bridge each week and it is clearly established as a major access point between South Bank and the city. Spanning the Brisbane River between the southern end of South Bank Parklands and the CBD via the Queensland University of Technology campus, the bridge provides a vital link for pedestrians and cyclists, especially since the closest train station to QUT is in South Bank. The bridge is also popular amongst those who like to maintain fitness, providing a link for a continuous run. Traceurs also use the bridge not only to cross, but in strength training as a distance to travel in the Quadrupedel movement (which provides an arm and leg workout), and also refines coordination skills. The bridge innovatively includes several outspanning seating bays which allow for contemplation of the river and relaxation. The architectural design has received mixed reviews; many people see it as a work of art, while others consider it a monstrosity. This is likely due to its unconventional form; for instance, the bridge is entirely asymmetrical, and does not appear to follow any particular scheme with regards to placement of features. Halfway across the bridge, there is a coffee cart with seating and cushions .

Only a few were produced, proving to have less impressive performance than the prototypes. Development Kurt Tank's team at Focke- Wulf had been working for some time on a fast attack-bomber aircraft named Ta 211, so named because it planned to use an uprated Jumo 211R engine. The intended \\"Ta 211\\" design was a high-wing twin-engined design, built primarily of plywood, bonded with a special phenolic resin adhesive called Tego film. The only large-scale use of metal was in the pressurized cockpit. The project's designation was changed to Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM‚ÄîMinistry of Aviation) airframe number 8-154 (hence Ta 154) when it became apparent that the most suitable engine for the aircraft was the more powerful Jumo 213, and that Junkers could not deliver the Jumo 211R in time due to technical and production problems. The 154 was also allocated the name \\"Moskito\\" as a form of recognition of the Royal Air Forces (RAF) de Havilland Mosquito. It was at about this time that the light and very fast de Havilland Mosquito, also made of wood, arrived over Germany. It quickly racked up an impressive record; in its first 600 bombing missions, only one was shot down, compared to an average of 5% for RAF medium and heavy bombers. Erhard Milch personally requested a purpose-built German answer, and selected the 154. Infighting within German circles started almost immediately, because the RLM and night fighter units ‚Äî as well as Ernst Heinkel himself ‚Äî still wanted the Heinkel He 219. Milch took this personally, and spent the better part of the next two years trying to have the 219 program terminated, partly against Ernst Heinkel's wishes. Flight tests Development of the Ta 154 was already well advanced, and the first prototype V1 with Jumo 211F engines, bearing the Stammkennzeichen identification code TE+FE, made its maiden flight on July 1, 1943. It was followed by V2 with Jumo 211N engines, which was kept at the factory for handling trials. V1 was then sent to Rechlin-L√§rz Airfield for fly-off testing against the He 219A and the new Junkers Ju 388. There the 154 reached almost 700 km/h (440 mph) and easily outflew the other two aircraft, but those were both fully armed and equipped with radar. The first armed example of the Ta 154 was the V3 prototype, which was also the first to fit the Jumo 211R engines. The added weight of the guns and drag of the 32-dipole element Matratze radar antennas used on its UHF-band FuG 212 C-1 Lichtenstein radar unit slowed the aircraft by a full 75 km/h, although it was still somewhat faster than the He 219. The rest of the 15 prototypes were then delivered as A-0 models, identical to the V3. Some of these also included a raised canopy for better vision to the rear. By June 1944, the Jumo 213 was finally arriving in some numbers, and a production run of 154 A-1s was completed with these engines. Just prior to delivery the only factory making Tego-Film, in Wuppertal, was bombed out by the Royal Air Force, and the plywood glue had to be replaced by one that was not as strong, and was later found to react chemically, apparently in a corrosive manner, with the wood in the Ta 154's structure. In July, several A-1s crashed with wing failure due to plywood delamination. This same problem also critically affected the Heinkel He 162 Spatz, Ernst Heinkel's \\"Volksj√§ger\\" jet fighter program entry. Tank halted production in August, and the RLM eventually cancelled the entire project in September (Milch had been removed by then). At that time about 50 production aircraft had been completed, and a number of the A-0 preproduction aircraft were later modified to production standard. An unknown number of the aircraft served with Nachtjagdgeschwader 3, and a few were later used as training aircraft for jet pilots. Mistel/Pulkzerst√∂rer variants The designation Ta 154A-2/U3 was given to six unfinished 154A-1 airframes completed and converted into Pulkzerst√∂rer (Formation Destroyer) aircraft. At least three Pulkzerst√∂rer and Mistel parasite fighter schemes were mooted for the 154. The only one of the three that was actually brought to operational readiness (Ta 154A-2/U3) was a system whereby the entire forward fuselage ahead of the fuel tanks was filled with Amatol high explosive. A new and extremely small cockpit for the pilot was added to the airframe directly ahead of the tailfin. From this cramped cabin, the pilot would fly the 'Bomb Moskito ' into an Allied bomber formation, arm the onboard charges and quickly bail out. A timer would then detonate the explosives a few seconds later. Fragmentation charges in the warhead would maximize the effective area of destruction. It was hoped that this flying bomb system would tear large holes in the Anglo-American bomber streams at little cost to the Luftwaffe in terms of pilot casualties. The six Ta 154A-2/U3 'Bomb Moskitos were completed at the Focke-Wulf plant near Pozna≈Ñ shortly before the occupation of the area by the Red Army, but were not used in combat. Their ultimate fate is unknown, though it is likely they were destroyed by the plant's staff to prevent them being captured. One Ta 154 Mistel scheme, reportedly designated Mistel 7, envisaged a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 'mother aircraft' mounted on struts above an unmanned Bomb Moskito. Takeoff would be effected via a sturdy three-wheeled trolley of the same type designed for the abandoned A-series of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance bomber. The trolley would be jettisoned after takeoff, leaving the Mistel Moskito to fly to its target with all three engines running. The combination would formate above an Allied bomber stream before the 190 pilot released the Bomb Moskito, which would then hopefully crash straight into a bomber with massively destructive effect. A related scheme would see a standard Ta 154 towing a Bomb Moskito behind it into the middle of a bomber stream, whereupon release and detonation would be initiated by the manned 154's pilot.

Risk-aware consensual kink (RACK, also risk- accepted consensual kink) is an acronym used by some of the BDSM community to describe a philosophical view that is generally permissive of certain risky sexual behaviors, as long as the participants are fully aware of the risks. This is often viewed in contrast to safe, sane, and consensual which generally holds that only activities that are considered safe, sane, and consensual are permitted.  Philosophy  RACK's tenets are best described by a deconstruction of the acronym: * Risk-aware: Both or all partners are well- informed of the risks involved in the proposed activity. * Consensual: In light of those risks, both or all partners have, of sound mind, offered preliminary consent to engage in said activity. * Kink: Said activity can be classified as alternative sex. While \\"Safe, Sane and Consensual\\" (SSC) attempts to describe and differentiate BDSM from abuse in ways that are easy for the non-BDSM public to comprehend, RACK differs from it in that it acknowledges that nothing is ever 100% inherently safe. By acknowledging that what may be safe or sane to one person may not be considered the same to another, the RACK philosophy tends to be more inclusive of activities that others may consider as edgeplay. There is no \\"safe\\" or \\"not safe\\" within RACK, only \\"safer\\" and \\"less safe.\\" RACK can also be described as a mindset which pays more attention to perhaps unexpected consequences of BDSM play. Its theory revolves around reasoned, ex-ante commitment, including the possible consequences of riskier play. In contrast, SSC revolves around the end results of play, or the ex-post. It tries to minimize any potential harm despite the risks BDSM players might be willing to partake in. Both philosophies aim to minimize foreseeable harm, but RACK puts more emphasis on individual commitment to possible risk, beforehand, while SSC tries to minimize total harm foreseeable over the longer term. Thus, RACK adherents stress the value of individual prior consent to even risky fun, while the SSC contingent counters that people often do not choose as freely as they seem, they might behave irrationally at times, and so the consequences of rash individual choice perhaps ought to be mitigated from the start.  History  RACK was coined in reaction to dissatisfaction within the BDSM community regarding SSC. According to David Stein, the man who coined \\"Safe, Sane, and Consensual S/M\\" for New York‚Äôs Gay Male S/M Activists organization, SSC was only intended to be put forward as a minimum standard for ethically defensible S/M play, to establish a distinction between play between loving S/M partners and the public perception of sadomasochism which would be more accurately described as abusive behavior. Over time, as the phrase started spreading through the larger community and appeared on bumper stickers and T-shirts, people started to associate \\"safe\\" with \\"risk-free,\\" diluting the message. \\"Instead of asking people to think about what it means to do S/M ethically, and to make the hard choices that are sometimes necessary (if only between what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs right now), many organizations today act as if these issues have all been settled, assuring us that sadistic or masochistic behavior not deemed SSC isn‚Äôt S/M at all but something else ‚Äî abuse, usually, or domestic violence or poor self-esteem.\\" In 1999, Gary Switch posted to The Eulenspiegel Society's USENET list \\"TES-Friends\\" proposing the term RACK out of a desire to form a more accurate portrayal of the type of play that many engage in. Noting that nothing is truly 100% safe, not even crossing the street, Switch compared BDSM to the sport of mountain climbing. In both, risk is an essential part of the thrill, and that risk is minimized through study, training, technique, and practice.  Variations  Not all members of the BDSM community adhere to one principle to the exclusion of the other. Some people subscribe to both mottos, using SSC as a description of the activities to any member of the general public, while using RACK as a description of the activities within members of a community. Still others define their own terms, the term PRICK (Personal Responsibility, Informed Consensual Kink) in particular emphasizes the concept of taking personal responsibility for your actions, as well as an informed analysis of the risks. In some \\"old-guard\\" circles the term \\"Committed Compassionate Consensual\\" is circulated.

A relatively sophisticated design, the He 219 possessed a variety of innovations, including Lichtenstein SN-2 advanced VHF-band intercept radar, also used on the Ju 88G and Bf 110G night fighters. It was also the first operational military aircraft to be equipped with ejection seats and the first operational German World War II-era aircraft with tricycle landing gear. Had the Uhu been available in quantity, it might have had a significant effect on the strategic night bombing offensive of the Royal Air Force; however, only 294 of all models were built by the end of the war and these saw only limited service.Boyne 1997, p. 330. Ernst-Wilhelm Modrow was the leading night fighter ace on the He 219. Modrow was credited with 33 of his 34 night air victories on the type. Design and development Development and production of the He 219 was protracted and tortuous, due to political rivalries between Josef Kammhuber, commander of the German night fighter forces, Ernst Heinkel, the manufacturer and Erhard Milch, responsible for aircraft construction in the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM ‚Äì the German Aviation Ministry). The aircraft was also complicated and expensive to build; these factors further limited the number of aircraft produced. When engineer Robert Lusser returned to Heinkel from Messerschmitt, he began work on a new high-speed bomber project called P.1055. This was an advanced design with a pressurized cockpit, twin ejection seats (the first to be planned for use in any combat aircraft), tricycle landing gear ‚Äì featuring a nose gear that rotated its main strut through 90¬∞ during retraction (quickly orienting the nosewheel into the required horizontal position for stowage within the nose, only at the very end of the retraction cycle) to fit flat within the forward fuselage,Japanese-language site showing He 219 nosegear retraction animation and remotely controlled, side-mounted FDSL 131 defensive gun turrets similar to those used by the Messerschmitt Me 210. Power was to be provided by two of the potentially troublesome, dual-crankcase DB 610 \\"power system\\" engines then under development, weighing on the order of about 1‚Äì tonnes apiece, producing (2,200 kW/2,950 hp) each, delivering excellent performance with a top speed of approximately 750 km/h (470 mph) and a 4,000 km (2,500 mi) range with a 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) bomb load. The RLM rejected the design in August 1940 as too complex and risky. Lusser quickly offered four versions of the fighter with various wingspans and engine choices in order to balance performance and risk. At the same time, he offered the P.1056, a night fighter with four 20 mm cannon in the wings and fuselage. The RLM rejected all of these on the same grounds in 1941. Heinkel was furious and fired Lusser on the spot. About the same time as Lusser was designing the P.1055, Kammhuber had started looking for an aircraft for his rapidly growing night fighter force. Heinkel quickly re-designed the P.1055 for this role as the P.1060. This design was similar in layout but somewhat smaller and powered by two of the largest displacement (at 44.5 litres/2,700 cu. in.) single-block liquid-cooled aviation engines placed in mass production in Germany, the DB 603 inverted V12 engine. As designed by Heinkel, these engines' nacelle accommodations featured annular radiators similar to the ones on the Jumo 211-powered Junkers Ju 88A, but considerably more streamlined in appearance, and which, after later refinement to their design, were likely to have been unitized as a Heinkel-specific Kraftei engine unit-packaging design. Nearly identical-appearance nacelles, complete with matching annular radiators, were also used on the four prototype He 177B prototype airframes built in 1943‚Äì44, and the six ordered prototypes of Heinkel's He 274 high-altitude strategic bombers with added turbochargers. The early DB 603 subtypes had poor altitude performance, which was a problem for Heinkel's short-winged design, but Daimler had a new \\"G\\" subtype of the DB 603 powerplant meant to produce 1,400 kW (1,900 PS) take-off power apiece under development to remedy the problem. Heinkel was sure he had a winner and sent the design off to the RLM in January 1942, while he funded the first prototype himself. The RLM again rejected the He 219, in favour of new Ju 88- and Me 210-based designs. Construction of the prototype started in February 1942 but suffered a serious setback in March, when Daimler said that the DB 603G engine would not be ready in time. Instead, they would deliver a 603A engine with a new gear ratio to the propellers, as the DB 603C with the choice of using four-blade propellers, as the similarly-powered Fw 190C high-altitude fighter prototypes were already starting to use into early 1943, with the DB 603.Wagner and Nowarra 1971, p. 246. DB 603 engines did not arrive until August 1942 and the prototype did not fly until 6 November 1942.Green and Swanborough 1989, p. 12. When Kammhuber saw the prototype on 19 November, he was so impressed that he immediately ordered it into production over Milch's objections. Milch‚Äîwho had rejected the He 219 in January‚Äîwas enraged. Stability problems with the aircraft were noted but Heinkel overcame these by offering a cash prize to engineers who could correct them. Further changes were made to the armament during the development of the prototype He 219V-series. The dorsal rear defensive guns‚Äîmounted atop the fuselage and firing directly rearward from a fixed, internally mounted, rear-facing dorsal \\"step\\" position, at a point just aft of the wing trailing edge ‚Äì were removed due to their ineffectiveness. The forward-firing armament complement of the aircraft was increased to two Mauser MG 151/20 20 mm autocannon in the wing roots, inboard of the propeller arcs to avoid the need for gun synchronizers, with four more MG 151/20 autocannon mounted in the ventral fuselage tray, which had originally ended in a rearwards-facing \\"step\\" similar to and located directly under the deleted rear dorsal \\"step\\" ‚Äì this rearwards-facing feature was also deleted for similar reasons. The A-0 model featured a bulletproof shield, that could be raised in the front interior cockpit, hiding the entire bottom portion of the windscreen, providing temporary pilot protection and leaving a sighting slot by which the gunsight could be aimed at a bomber. Production prototypes were then ordered as the He 219 A-0 and quickly progressed to the point where V7, V8 and V9 were handed over to operational units in June 1943 for testing. The earlier prototypes, with four-blade propellers for their DB 603 enginesHe 219 V5 fifth prototype photo (also used on the Fw 190C prototypes, with the same DB 603 engine) had blunt, compound- curvature metal nose cones also used for production-series He 219A airframes. The initial examples of these nose cones possessed cutouts for their use with the quartet of forward-projecting masts for the Matratze 32-dipole radar antennae on the noses of at least the first five prototypes, used with the early UHF-band Lichtenstein B/C or C-1 radar installation.\\"Heinkel He 219.\\" Livevehicles.com. Retrieved: 23 April 2015. These early He 219V-series prototype airframes also had cockpit canopies that did not smoothly taper aftwards on their upper profile, as on the later production He 219A-series airframes, but instead ended in a nearly hemispherically-shaped enclosure.\\"Heinkel He 219.\\" falkeeins.blogspot.com, November 2010.

The idea for the rear- facing dorsal and ventral \\"step\\" features on the original He 219 fuselage design, for armament emplacement locations was later carried into the May 1943 revised fuselage design, for what became the Heinkel Amerikabomber design contract competitor, the He 277, for its revised fuselage design to accommodate a tricycle undercarriage.

Milch repeatedly tried to have the He 219 program cancelled and in the process, Kammhuber was removed from office. Production ceased for a time, but was restarted because the new Junkers Ju 388s were taking too long to get into service. Operational history The He 219 had an auspicious combat debut. On the night of 11‚Äì12 June 1943, Werner Streib flew the V9 and shot down five bombers between 01:05 and 02:22 hours, before crashing on landing.Chef f√ºr Ausz. und Disziplin Luftwaffen-Personalamt L.P.

Production problems as a result of Allied bombing in March meant the A-0 did not reach Luftwaffe units until October 1943.Greenhous 1994, p. 705. I The A-0 was usually armed with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon in the wing roots and up to four 20 mm or 30 mm cannon in a ventral weapons bay. The first 10‚Äì15 aircraft were delivered with the 490 MHz UHF-band FuG 212 \\"Lichtenstein\\" C-1 radar with a 4 √ó 8-dipole element Matratze antenna array. 104 He 219 A-0s were built until the summer of 1944, the majority of them at EHW (Ernst Heinkel Wien) or Heinkel-S√ºd in Wien-Schwechat. A production He 219A with Hirschgeweih VHF radar antennas The first planned version to reach production was the He 219 A-2 model, which had longer engine nacelles containing extra fuel tanks, unitized 1670 PS DB 603AA engines with higher critical altitude and often also two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon, as an offensive Schr√§ge Musik upward-firing system completely contained within the rear fuselage, with the cannons' muzzles even with the dorsal fuselage surface. With Schr√§ge Musik, the ventral weapons bay held two cannon due to space limitations.He 219 A-0 aircraft manual, section 8A Beiheft 1 Schr√§gbewaffnung, October 1944. The A-2 featured an updated, 90 MHz VHF-band Telefunken FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 radar system, complete with its larger, high-drag 4 √ó 2-dipole element Hirschgeweih aerials. It initially had a longer minimum range than the C-1 radar, but had improved accuracy and resolution and was also less vulnerable to chaff jamming, through the late summer of 1944. A total of 85 He 219 A-2s were built until November 1944, most at EHR (Ernst Heinkel Rostock) or Heinkel-Nord in Rostock-Marienehe (now Rostock-Schmarl). The He 219 was a capable fighter aircraft and the pilots were free to hunt down any detected Allied bombers. Ground control sent the aircraft into the right area, where the pilots took over and guided themselves towards the bombers with the Lichtenstein VHF radar's information. The SN-2 radar's 4 km (3 mi) maximum detection range was greater than the distance between the bombers. While the performance of the A-2 was not extraordinary‚Äîapproximately 580 km/h (360 mph) speed‚Äîit was enough of an advance over the Messerschmitt Bf 110Gs and Dornier Do 217Ns, for the crew to chase several bombers in a single sortie. A 1945 picture of a captured He 219 in British markings. The aircraft is missing its cockpit canopy To improve its ability to intercept the Mosquito, the He 219 had excess weight removed. With some weapon and radio systems removed, the aircraft was able to attain a speed of 650 km/h (400 mph). This version was given the designation A-6. None of these were produced, but similar weight saving measures could be undertaken at the unit level. The last major production version was the A-7 with improved, unitized DB 603E engines. The A-7 typically had two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon in the wing roots (inboard of the propeller arcs), two 20 mm MG 151/20 in the ventral weapons bay and two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108s as rear-fuselage dorsal mount, upwards- firing Schr√§ge Musik offensive ordnance. Production of 210 aircraft was to start November/December 1944, but the number produced is not known as original documents have been lost or contained no sub-version number. =Further developments= The troublesome Jumo 222 multibank engine, meant for the He 219B and -C subtypes The follow-on series to the He 219As in service was to be the He 219B fitted with the new, but troublesome 1,864 kW (2,500 hp) Junkers Jumo 222A/B 24-cylinder engines ‚Äì a multibank, liquid-cooled inline engine, with six rows of cylinder blocks having four cylinders each‚Äîwhich would have allowed the He 219 to reach 700 km/h (440 mph), each of which were almost the same displacement in their A/B (supercharged) and E/F (supercharged with intercoolers) versions and each only very slightly heavier, compared to the Double Wasp radial engines in the American P-61 night fighter. The He 219B wing was also to have had an increased span of 22.06 m (72.38 ft), for better high altitude performance. The Jumo 222 did not reach production status, with just under 300 examples built in at least three differing displacement sizes. Only a few test machines were ever fitted for the engines; some additional airframes were built with the enlarged wing. These examples were slated to fly with high-altitude versions of the standard DB 603 powerplants in place of the troubled Jumo 222 multibank powerplants, but only one or two test machines ever flew with them. A further adaptation would have been the He 219C, also intended to use the B-series design's big wing and Jumo 222 powerplants as well as an all-new fuselage of 17.15 m (56.27 ft), with a complete three-man Ju 388J cockpit section forward, converted to accept the He 219A's standard nose gear layout (the Ju 388 itself used the Ju 88's conventional gear design), the Borsig-designed Hecklafette HL 131V \\"quadmount\\", hydraulic- powered four-gun manned tail turret intended for later He 177A versions and the He 177B-5, as well as more than one Amerika Bomber strategic bomber design competitor.Heinkel Typenblatt general arrangement drawing.\\" germanaircraftwwii.com. Retrieved: 23 April 2015. Day bomber and night fighter versions were proposed and metal was cut for the project but, without the over-1,500-kW output Jumo 222 engines getting out of their strictly experimental status, they never flew. Paper projects include the very-high- altitude He 219E with a vastly increased wingspan of 28.5 m (93.5 ft) and 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) output rated DB 614 engines, which were apparently a further-uprated version of the never-produced DB 603G inverted V12, capable of the desired 1,491 kW (2,000 hp) power output level that Germany had so much trouble crafting into combat-reliable aviation powerplants. A more reasonable project was the H√ºtter H√º 211, a design by Wolfgang H√ºtter that took a standard He 219 fuselage and tail and added a long-span, high aspect ratio wing of 24.55 m (80.54 ft) to create a fast, high altitude interceptor. Since this design was also meant to be powered by the ill-fated Jumo 222 it never flew, although work continued on two sets of wings until they were destroyed by Allied bombing. The He 219 was the only piston-engined night fighter capable of facing the British Mosquito on equal terms, given its speed, manoeuvrability and firepower,Kay and Smith 2002, p. 154. but it never played a significant role in the war because the industry failed to make it available in sufficient numbers.

These aircraft were made flight-worthy by \\"Watson's Whizzers\\" and flown to Cherbourg, France. He 219 A-2 Werknummer 290 202 was shipped to the United States with 21 other captured German aircraft on board the British escort carrier , and was reassembled at Newark Army Air Field, Newark, New Jersey. Werknummer 290 202 was given the foreign equipment number FE-614, and later T2-614. The aircraft was flown to Freeman Field, Indiana for flight testing along with a second of the three He 219s: a He 219 A-5 prototype, Werknummer 290 060 and given the foreign equipment number FE-612. The fate of Werknummer 290 060 is unknown. Following testing, He 219 A-2 Werknummer 290 202 was then moved to Orchard Place Airport in Park Ridge, Illinois in 1946. It was stored in a vacant aircraft factory and then transferred to the Smithsonian's National Air Museum on 3 January 1949. Finally, the He 219 was crated and shipped to the Smithsonian's Silver Hill, Maryland storage facility in early 1955.

The Free Zone, ‚ÄúFreezone‚Äù, or more recently identified as Independent Scientology, comprises a variety of non-affiliated independent groups and individuals who practice Scientology beliefs and techniques independently of the Church of Scientology (CoS). \\"One of the first steps toward open warfare was the emergence, in about 1990, of a group that wanted to separate the church and its scriptures. Calling itself the Free Zone, this group consists of people who have left the church but still want to practice its teachings - use the tech, as Free Zoners say. Ex Scientologist Homer Smith is one of these (ex meaning \\"former church adherent,\\" not \\"former\\" Scientologist, says Smith). Wanting to encourage serious discussion of the tech away from the noisy brawl next door in alt.religion.scientology, Smith set up a second newsgroup, alt.clearing.technology, for this purpose.\\" Such practitioners range from those who closely adhere to the original teachings of Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, to those who have adapted their practices so far that they are almost unrecognizable as Scientology. The term Free Zone was originally only used by a single organization, but the term is now commonly applied to all non-CoS Scientologists, although many dispute the application of the term to themselves. The International Freezone Association, the group whose name became adopted as a generic term for independent Scientology, was not the first independent Scientologist group; the California Association of Dianetic Auditors, the oldest breakaway group still in existence, Additional convenience link at . claims a founding date of December 1950, predating the Church of Scientology itself. A November 2004 press release published by the International Freezone Association cited a command written by Hubbard: \\"... before you go, whisper this to your sons and their sons: 'THE WORK WAS FREE. KEEP IT SO.'\\" Skeptic Magazine described the Free Zone as: \\"a group founded by ex-Scientologists to promote L. Ron Hubbard's ideas independent of the Church of Scientology.\\" A Miami Herald article wrote that ex-Scientologists joined the Free Zone because they felt that Church of Scientology leadership had \\"strayed from Hubbard's original teachings.\\" Origin of the term Free Zone The first group to use the term Free Zone was in the organization founded by the captain of the Apollo Flagship and Second-Deputy Commodore of the Sea Org, Captain Bill Robertson, in mid-1982, which is now known as \\"Ron's Org\\" in several countries. The name came from the \\"space opera\\" beliefs of L. Ron Hubbard, which Robertson later expressed in the \\"Free Zone Decree\\", which he said was an Official Decree of \\"Galactic Central - Grand Council\\" which was \\"relayed from Mainship Sector 9\\": #The planet known as Teegeeack - local dialect \\"Earth\\" or Terra - Sun 12, Sector 9, is hereby declared a Free Zone. #No political interference in its affairs from any other part of the Sector or Galaxy will be tolerated. #No economic interference in its affairs will be tolerated from any non-planetary agency or power. #All of its inhabitants are hereby declared Free Zone Citizens and free of external political or economic interference.The Free Zone Decree Germany Scientology Commissioner Ursula Caberta in Hamburg said that the Free Zone is a type of \\"methadone program for Scientologists,\\" and, in any case, \\"the lesser evil\\". The Free Zone group Ron's Org says that the Verfassungsschutz Baden-W√ºrttemberg (State Office for the Protection of the Constitution) has stated that there is no need to keep Ron's Org under observation \\"as the Ron's Org has no anti-constitutional goals.\\" There is some cooperation between members of the Ron's Org and state authorities who observe the Church of Scientology and investigate their activities.\\"Maybe it makes you feel more confident, for example, if you learn that the office for safeguarding the constitution (Verfassungsschutz) of the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg has stated years ago that the RON‚Äôs Org is not a part of the Church of Scientology and that there is no need to observe them as the RON‚Äôs Org has no anti-constitutional goals. Indeed, there is some cooperation between members of the RON‚Äôs Org and state authorities who observe the Church of Scientology and investigate their activities. English FAQ on German Ron's Org site The Church of Scientology and the Free Zone Mark Rathbun was a high-level official with the Church of Scientology, overseeing its intellectual property. After leaving the Church, he continued to practice the religion independently for several years. Rathbun, since 2016, has supported the Church of Scientology in many of his more recent blog articles. Suggesting he may have settled his wife's lawsuit with the church and is now under contract with them once again as a media operative, sub rosa. The Church labels all practitioners of and believers in Scientology without its sanction \\"squirrels\\"‚Äîa term Hubbard coined to describe those who alter Scientology technology or practice it in a nonstandard fashion. Among Scientologists, the term is pejorative, and comparable in meaning to \\"heretic\\". In practice, the hierarchy of the Church of Scientology uses it to describe all of those who practice Scientology outside the Church. As of 2016, many of the major courses and publications in the Church have been altered or deleted altogether. This is a main protest and action point for Independent/Freezone Scientologists. Major courses, such as the Class VI and Class VIII auditor training courses, which had very high enrollment in the 1970s, have been shut down. Additionally, Scientology critics in the Freezone movement have claimed that alterations have been made to Hubbard‚Äôs original writings in church policies and even more so in technical bulletins, with parishioners never made aware of the changes to these writings. In addition, in 2009, the church created a new course called ‚ÄúThe Basics Course,\\" which is believed to be redundant with existing courses and motivated for profit. Also as of 2016, the church removed the bulk of the Scientology technical bulletins, known as the \\"Tech Volumes,\\" a republished and expanded edition of the 1975 issue of Technical Bulletins in 1991, from all course rooms worldwide. A violation of the aforementioned HCO PL \\"Technical Degrades\\", and HCO PL \\"Safeguarding Technology.\\", as well as Hubbard's HCO PL \\"Hidden Data Line.\\" \\"Hidden data Line\\" expresses that all data is out in the open for all to see, which is now not the case with the majority of technical references deleted from academies. Independent Scientologists note that the Technical Volume‚Äôs 1991 copyrights have lapsed, thus forcing the church to newly publish them with alterations so as to keep the copyrights valid. They argue that this continual redux of books and bulletins by the COS, under US copyright law, only affects what was changed, not the original works by Hubbard. Forcing them to publish new similar, but entirely altered and different in the same breath, books titled on the cover stating ‚Äúbased on the works of...‚Äù and singularly Hubbard‚Äôs name but no ‚ÄúBy‚Äù next to his name, just his name. With the omission of the Scientology Technical Volumes, the final act of subrogation has begun by the church's Non- Scientologist board members into a real estate acquisition firm completely, based on parishioners donations in their entirety of payment for new buildings and their contents, not the church's own funds. Ergo, the church no longer practices Hubbards intent of delivering Scientology, but is a firm collecting donations for its own profit, not to aid parishioners in Hubbard's original intent of Scientology providing spiritual freedom in the form of new technology of the mind for all, at a non-exorbant cost. The parishioners have become the product, for acquiring real estate on a wholesale basis. (It's gone as far as the main statistics, after nearly fifty years. those statistics being well done auditing hours, as a senior statistic, to JUST books and lectures sold, in 2016. This was never the intent of Hubbard to invert books for auditing. Auditing has always been senior with book sales needed, but not paramount to auditing and training, by any standard per Hubbard references on the subject. The alterations to the auditing technology have been so wide sweeping as to make them unworkable/untrainable, as Hubbard always predicted, if changes were made to the auditing and administration technology for the Organizations. Thus, the focus has been changed to a far more profitable, more doable, books sold statistic instead as of this writing in 2018.) These organizations, once paid for by parishioner donations to the \\"Ideal Org program\\" (a perversion of a Hubbard policy of the same name in the Data Series policy letters as well as LRH Executive Directive 339R \\"The LRH Birthday Game\\"), the orgs themselves are then charged rent by the mother organization, the COS, and further the CST (The senior organization in charge of the COS.) Not free to those organizations, as is fraudulently, and tacitly implied in donor publications. These organizations that can barely support themselves or their staff are now burdened with rent for a building they cannot possibly support with students or auditing public, given the alterations to Hubbards technology and administrative policies. On top of that many, if not most of these buildings are sublet to non-Scientologist lessors to earn a profit for CST, not the local organization. This is another datum the parishioner donors are not informed of when donating for the multi million dollar off policy ‚ÄúIdeal Orgs‚Äù by the COS/CST. The Church of Scientology has used copyright and trademark laws against various Free Zone groups. Accordingly, most of the Free Zone avoids the use of officially trademarked Scientology words, including Scientology itself. In 2000, the Religious Technology Center unsuccessfully attempted to gain the Internet domain name scientologie.org from the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization; one of the 16 specialized agencies of the United Nations), in a legal action against the Free Zone. Many Free Zone advocates say that everyone has the right to freely practice the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard, whether sanctioned by the Church or not. In support of this they cite Hubbard himself: > Dianetics is not in any way covered by legislation anywhere, for no law can > prevent one man sitting down and telling another man his troubles, and if > anyone wants a monopoly on dianetics, be assured that he wants it for > reasons which have to do not with dianetics but with profit. > > ‚ÄîL. Ron Hubbard, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health (1950) > If I have fought for a quarter of a century, most of it alone, to keep this > work from serving to uphold the enslavers of Man, to keep it free from some > destructive \\"pitch\\" or slant, then you certainly can carry that motif a > little further. [...] But before you go, whisper this to your sons, and > their sons ‚Äì \\"The work was free. Keep it so.\\" > > ‚ÄîL. Ron Hubbard, Scientology: Clear Procedure - Issue One (1957) Other Free Zoners assert basic human rights protections in order to freely follow their chosen religion. One Free Zone Scientologist, identified as \\"Safe\\", was quoted in Salon as saying: \\"The Church of Scientology does not want its control over its members to be found out by the public and it doesn't want its members to know that they can get Scientology outside of the Church of Scientology\\". A 2006 Channel 4 documentary presented by Sikh comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli, The Beginner's Guide to L. Ron Hubbard, explored Scientology with the \\"Ron's Org\\" Free Zone group after the Church of Scientology declined to take part. A 2017 episode of the docuseries Believer hosted by religious scholar Reza Aslan focused on Scientology, however, Aslan was unable to get in contact with any Church officials so instead the episode focused on and featured an array of Independent Scientologists. https://www.cnn.com%2Fvideos%2Ftv%2F2017%2F03%2F17%2Fbeliever-reza-aslan- scientology-orig-ff.cnn&usg;=AOvVaw1Kaj0X9lALaH4YD3cGkQ2Z Aslan has compared the Freezone to other schisms in religious history, including the Protestant Reformation. https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/reza-aslan-believer-scientology- muslim-american-tv-show.html Aslan included professor of Theology, and scholar of New Religious Movements, Donald Westbrook in the episode, who has also argued the position that Scientology fits the criteria for recognition as a religion. https://www.cesnur.org/2017/reza_aslan.htm Despite not returning his phone calls offering to be part of the episode, The Church of Scientology responded with harsh criticism of the episode and stated ‚Äúnot a single Scientologist appeared in the program.‚Äù https://www.standleague.org/blog/reza- aslan-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing.html The \\"Ron's Org Committee\\" (ROC) and the \\"True Source Scientology Foundation\\" (STSS, \\"Stichting True Source Scientology\\") have documented the argument that Scientology materials written by L. Ron Hubbard are in the public domain if certain assumptions are made. In addition the ROC has documented a legal battle over the trademark \\"Ron's Org\\". Alternative auditing practices Several alternatives to Dianetics were developed in the early years of the Free Zone. Synergetics is a self-help system developed by Art Coulter in 1954. American businessman, Don A.Purcell (Junior), founded an early Dianetics organization which had a tentative claim on the Dianetics trademark, joined Synergetics and allegedly returned the Dianetics and HASI trademarks ownership to Hubbard when Hubbard was forced by Purcell's Lawyers to close the failed Wichita Dianetics Foundation in a civil legal dispute over unpaid organisational bills and lawyers fees was settled 'out of court' amicably in 1954 in the US.A Piece of Blue Sky In 1976, Coulter published Synergetics: An Adventure in Human Development; he later founded the Synergetic Society, which published a journal through 1996. Idenics is a personal counseling method not affiliated with any religion, that was developed by John Galusha beginning in 1987. Mr. Galusha researched for L. Ron Hubbard during the 1950s, and was one of the founders of the first Church of Scientology in 1953. Galusha claimed that all personal issues can be addressed by thoroughly looking over the problem at hand, without judgment. The counselor asks a series of questions until the solution is considered found, by the client. Mike Goldstein, the owner of Idenics methodology and author of the book, \\"Idenics, an alternative to therapy\\", claims that the method is as effective over the telephone as in person. The word \\"Scientology\\" Disagreement over the origins of the word Scientology has been used by Free Zone groups to contest Scientology's trademarks. A German book entitled Scientologie, Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens was published in 1934 by Anastasius Nordenholz.Preface The groups have argued that because Scientologie was not written by Hubbard, the Church is unfairly monopolizing control over its practice. The trademark rights to the use of Dianetics and the E-Meter (invented and created by Volney Mathieson) was allowed to lapse into the public domain in 1976 by Hubbard. This is discreetly ignored by the RTC/CSI Body Corporate.

Design started before the war, as a replacement for the Bf 110. The first examples were ready in 1939, but they proved to have unacceptably poor flight characteristics due to serious wing planform and fuselage design flaws. A large-scale operational testing program throughout 1941 and early 1942 did not cure the type's problems. The design entered limited service in 1943, but was almost immediately replaced by the Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse (\\"Hornet\\"). The Me 410 was a further development of the Me 210, renamed so as to avoid the 210's notoriety. The failure of the Me 210's development program meant the Luftwaffe was forced to continue operating the Bf 110 after it had become outdated, despite mounting losses. Design and development Messerschmitt designers had started working on an upgrade of the Bf 110 in 1937, before the production version of the Bf 110 had even flown. In late 1938, the Bf 110 was just entering service, and the RLM started looking ahead for its eventual replacement. Messerschmitt sent in their modified Bf 110 design as the Me 210, and Arado responded with their all-new Ar 240. The Me 210 was a considerable departure from the 110, but used many of the same parts. The main differences were a modified nose area that was much shorter and located over the center of gravity, an internal bomb bay, an all-new wing designed for higher cruise speeds and a highly advanced remote-control defensive armament system that gave the gunner a far wider field of fire. On paper, the Me 210's performance was impressive: It could reach 620 km/h (390 mph) on two 1,350 PS (1,330 hp, 990 kW) Daimler-Benz DB 601F engines, making it about 80 km/h (50 mph) faster than the Bf 110, and nearly as fast as single-engine fighters of that era. The Me 210's main landing gear followed some of the design philosophies that had resulted from the main change in the earlier Ju 88's main landing gear design, where each main gear had a single gear strut that twisted through 90¬∞ during retraction, to bring the main gear wheel resting atop the lower end of the main strut when retracted rearwards into the wing. Unlike the Ju 88, however, the Me 210's main gear wheels were inboard of the main gear struts when fully extended, whereas the Ju 88's were outboard of the struts. Me 210 featured a bomb bay, unlike its predecessor Bf 110 Comparison of the wing planforms of the Me 210 and its successor, the Me 410 Hornisse. The Bf 110 carried its ordnance externally beneath the wings and fuselage, but this created drag; the Me 210 avoided this problem by housing the bombs in an enclosed bomb bay, in the nose of the aircraft. The Me 210 could carry up to two 500 kg (1,100 lb) bombs. The Me 210 had dive brakes fitted on the tops of the wings, and a Stuvi 5B bombsight (\\"Stuvi\\"-Sturzkampfvisier, dive-bombing sight) in the nose, for shallow-angle dive bombing. In the fighter role, the bomb bay was fitted with four 20 mm cannons. The FDSL 131 remote gun turret of an Me 210 being maintained For defence, the Me 210's rear gunner was armed with two 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns. Each of these was fitted into half-teardrop-shaped Ferngerichtete Drehringseitenlafette FDSL 131/1B turrets mounted on each side of the aircraft, and was remote-controlled from the gunner's position in the rear of the glazed cockpit area with a unique gun-aiming setup. This unit had a pivoting handgun-style grip, trigger and gunsight at its center, to aim the guns vertically‚Äîwith both turrets elevating and depressing together when operated - and horizontally, in pivoting each gun separately, outward away from the fuselage side when aimed to one side or the other. The rear of the cockpit canopy's lower side glazing panels were bulged out to allow the gunner to see in almost any rearward-facing direction. The guns were electrically fired, and an electrical contact breaker acted as a form of \\"interrupter\\" as used on many forms of multi-engined, turret-armed WW II aircraft, preventing the gunner from shooting off the Me 210's tailplane. An order for 1,000 Me 210s was placed before the prototype had flown. In time, this would prove to be a major error. The first prototype flew with DB 601B engines in September 1939, and was considered unsafe by test pilots. Stability was bad in turns, and it tended to oscillate, even while flying level. At first, the designers concentrated on the twin-rudder arrangement that had been taken from the 110, and replaced it with a new and much larger single vertical stabilizer. This had almost no effect, and the plane continued to \\"snake\\". The Me 210 also suffered from terrible stalls. With the nose up or in a turn, the stalls whipped into spins when the automatic leading-edge slats opened. The second prototype, Me 210 V2, was lost this way in September 1940, when the pilot could not get out of the resulting spin and had to abandon the aircraft. The chief test pilot commented that the Me 210 had \\"all the least desirable attributes an aeroplane could possess.\\" It took 16 prototypes and 94 preproduction examples to try to resolve the many problems. Nevertheless, the RLM was desperate to replace the Bf 110s currently in service, and ordered full production in early 1941. The type exhibited grossly inadequate handling characteristics, and as a result, several elements of the airframe were redesigned, including lengthening the rear section of the fuselage by 92 cm (36-1/4 inches), designated as lang (\\"long\\"). The Me 210C was built with DB 605 engines, as well as incorporating the changes to the airframe. The Hungarian authorities were satisfied with the Me 210C in its current state, and purchased a production license for the type, to fill the role of the Varga RMI-1 X/H, designated Me 210Ca (a = ausl√§ndisch or 'foreign') as well as for its DB 605 engines. Several airframes were also purchased, to be completed in Hungarian factories for practice while the assembly lines were set up. Production started in the Dunai Rep√ºl≈ëg√©pgy√°r Rt. (Danubian Aircraft Plant) as the Me 210Ca with the DB 605B engine, under an agreement where the Luftwaffe received two of every three produced. The Me 210 was eventually developed into the Messerschmitt Me 410, with DB 603 engines. Operational history right Deliveries to frontline units started in April 1942, and the plane proved to be even less popular with pilots. Production was stopped at the month's end, by which time only 90 had been delivered. Another 320 partially completed airframes were placed in storage. In its place, the Bf 110 was put back into production. Although the Bf 110 was now equipped with the newer DB 605B engines and greater firepower, it was still an outdated design. The Luftwaffe started receiving their Hungarian-built planes in April 1943, and the Hungarians in 1944; when they entered service they were more than satisfied with them. Production ended in March 1944, when the factory switched over to produce the Bf 109G. By that time, a total of 267 Me 210C had been built, 108 of which had been given to the Luftwaffe. They operated mostly in Tunisia and Sardinia, and were quickly replaced by the Me 410.

It was first published in 2004 and is the first of the Golden Hour time travel series. It tells the story of Rowan Popplewell and his sister, Nina, who, while emotionally disturbed by the death of their mother, travel back in time to the French Revolution. Plot summary The Golden Hour tells the story of Rowan and Nina's adventures the summer after their mother's death. Thirteen-year-old Rowan's life is at an all-time low: his father has turned to drinking, the family business is becoming a financial disaster, they have had to move from their house to a small apartment, and his musically talented ten-year-old sister Nina has become withdrawn. When his two great aunts invite Rowan and Nina to spend the summer with them in Owatannauk, Maine, a small (fictional) town on the tip of the state, Rowan anticipates a very boring summer with the two elderly women. But when he arrives he finds strange things starting to happen: the aunts run a curio shop stocking some items so curious they even compel Nina to start speaking again. Rowan and Nina meet two twins, Xanthe and Xavier Alexander, who tell them about an old abandoned resort that appears to be haunted. Instead, the resort turns out to be an elaborate time machine. Nina seems interested in using the machine to escape her troubled life, especially when Rowan tells her about the Enlightenment, a period of European history when superstition and church dogma began giving way to logic and reason, art and science made tremendous strides, and truth and beauty were celebrated. When Nina disappears the next morning, the older kids rush to the resort: as they suspect, she has used the time machine. But Rowan discovers that he has told his sister the wrong dates for the Enlightenment, and instead of directing her to Enlightenment France he has sent her into the middle of the violent French Revolution. Rowan, Xanthe and Xavier time-travel to the French Revolution to save Nina, meeting various historical characters along the way, and Nina ends up in New York at their bakery visiting their mom. Characters ;Rowan Popplewell: Rowan is a young man dealing with a great amount of stress. Because of his mother's death he has had to move with his father and sister to a small apartment where he has no room of his own. Before his mother died Rowan had many friends and a decent social life, but he now loses himself in video games to forget his problems. He describes himself as having a chest like a barrel, and being the kind of boy girls do not notice. ;Nina Popplewell: Nina is Rowan's younger sister and, according to Rowan, \\"was a firecracker, always jumping with ideas.\\" She has wild, uncontrollable black hair which tumbles over her shoulders and face. Nina is also a musical prodigy, able since the age of three to play tunes she had heard from the radio on the piano. After her mother's death, Nina \\"shut down\\". She stopped speaking and became dormant to the point of Rowan claiming that \\"I have no sister\\". It is also indicated from the text that she is highly intelligent. ;Xanthe Alexander: Xanthe is described as having many shoulder-length braids and almond-shaped eyes. It is indicated that she is highly attractive. She is intrigued by native cultures, living close to the land, but also things that are mystical, symbolic and mysterious. She is homeschooled, because she and her brother are too intellectually gifted to be accommodated with the public school system. She is described as highly logical. ;Xavier Alexander: Xavier is also described as attractive, and is a born liar. He remakes himself to suit whatever purpose is at hand, he loves to embellish the truth and he has an ego the size of a barn. Xavier also seeks freedom, independence and adventure, themes resonant with the spirit of the Gold Rush. He, like his sister, is homeschooled due to his advanced intelligence. He and Xanthe are fraternal twins, and he is the comedian of the two. ;Agatha Drake: Agatha is a very short and plump woman who Rowan thinks resembles a pumpkin. She has light brown hair that is always messy, likes to dress in bright colors, and it is implied that she can read minds. Agatha lives with her friend Gertrude Pembroke in Owatannauk, Maine, where she uses The Owatannauk's alleviators (time machines) to travel through time collecting various items for her and Gertrude's curio shop. It is noted in the book that she enjoys word games like Scrabble. She is a nun. ;Gertrude Pembroke: Gertrude is a tall and gaunt woman with a deep, melodic voice. She lives with her friend Agatha Drake in Owatannauk, Maine. She is not as outgoing as her friend Agatha Drake, and often described as humorless. She dresses in more somber colors than Agatha does. It is noted that she enjoys the game of chess. ; Otto: Otto is the robot from the Owatannauk's alleviators (time machines) References =References to actual history, geography and current science= Parts of the novel's action are set during the French Revolution.

The town was also home to the 20th- century naval officer and statesman Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, who lived at Broadlands. Notable buildings include a 13th-century hunting lodge, an 18th-century coaching inn and the 19th-century Corn Exchange.

In 2019, the town centre underwent substantial remodelling, removing the roundabout around the statue of Lord Palmerston, and creating a pedestrianised area. Romsey is twinned with Paimpol in Brittany (France), Battenberg in Germany and Treviglio in Italy.Romseynet.Romsey twinning History =Middle Ages to the Civil War= Romsey's name is believed to originate from the Old English R≈´m's eg, meaning \\"R≈´m's island\\". R≈´m is probably an abbreviation of a personal name like R≈´mwald (meaning \\"glorious leader\\"), and eg (meaning \\"island\\") may have denoted a monastic retreat in the Early Middle Ages, since it is common among religious place names. Alt URL The first church in Romsey was founded by Edward the Elder in 907 AD for his daughter, √Ülfl√¶d, a nun who became the first abbess of Romsey. Edgar the Peaceful re-founded the abbey under the Rule of Benedict in 967 AD, appointing as abbess a noblewoman named Merewenna in 974 AD. Merewenna was given charge of Edgar's stepdaughter, √Üthelfl√¶d, who later served as abbess herself. Both Merewenna and √Üthelfl√¶d are revered as saints. The surrounding village prospered alongside the religious community. In 1003 the Danes sacked Romsey and destroyed the Anglo-Saxon church in retaliation for the St Brice's Day Massacre. While there is no record of the abbey's restoration, it is written that in 1012 Emma of Normandy gave lands to the abbey and that there were a total of 54 nuns in Romsey during the reign of Cnut the Great. The Domesday Book of 1086 refers to a population of 127 households in Romsey, along with the earliest records of the watermills that would later establish it as an industrial town. Relative to other Domesday settlements, Romsey had a large population and paid a considerable amount of tax. Along with Wilton Abbey nearby, Romsey Abbey became known as a place of learning in the High Middle Ages. In 1086, Matilda of Scotland was sent there to be educated by her aunt, Cristina, who was then the abbess. A number of hopeful suitors visited the princess in Romsey, including the later king William Rufus, whose advances were hindered by her aunt. William was killed in 1100 while hunting in the New Forest, after which his body was carried through Bell Street in Romsey on its way to Winchester Cathedral. The existing abbey was built in the Norman style between 1120 and 1140 using Chilmark stone. It was likely designed by Henry of Blois, the brother of King Stephen and builder of the Hospital of St Cross in Winchester. The final three arches were added between 1230 and 1240, at which time more than 100 nuns belonged to the foundation. The north transept of the original Saxon church is still visible today. Henry I granted Romsey its first charter, allowing it to hold a full market each Sunday and a four-day fair at the Feast of St √Üthelfl√¶d the Virgin. This was confirmed by Henry II in 1268 and extended to the Feast of St Philip and St James by Henry III in 1272. Given these charters, it can be assumed that Romsey was flourishing in the 13th century, perhaps supported by a lucrative woollen industry whereby wool was woven and then fulled or pounded before being dyed and exported from nearby Southampton. It is suggested that towns like Romsey and New Alresford prospered as a result of their location, which allowed them to exploit the downland sheep economy while retaining access to a major port to the south. Romsey continued to grow and prosper until the Black Death struck the town in 1348-9, killing up to half its population of roughly 1,000 individuals. It is recorded that 90 nuns voted in the 1333 abbatial election but never more than 25 in elections held from 1350 onwards. Plague arrived again in 1526, with Henry VIII abandoning his plans to spend the eve of the Assumption in Romsey and instead heading to Winchester. Prosperity never returned to the abbey. Romsey Abbey was finally suppressed by Henry VIII upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, during which time many religious buildings were destroyed. The abbey itself was saved from demolition, ostensibly due to a section dedicated to St Lawrence that was used as the parish church. In 1544, the townspeople were allowed to purchase the abbey from the Crown for a sum of ¬£100. The section that saved it was subsequently demolished, however, with the remainder being used as the parish church that exists today. By the mid-16th century Romsey's population was about 1,500, its woollen and tanning industries having fuelled growth. After his visit to Broadlands in 1607, James I granted the town a charter and made it a borough. This gave official status to an informal local government that had been running the town's affairs since the Dissolution in 1539. Romsey could now have a corporation comprising a mayor, six aldermen, twelve chief burgesses and a town clerk. There was also to be a local law court under a Court Recorder assisted by two sergeants-at-mace and, over all, a High Steward, the first of whom was the Earl of Southampton. Romsey changed hands several times during the English Civil War, with both Royalist and Parliamentary troops occupying and plundering the town. Most significant were the events of 1643 in which William Waller, having captured Winchester, marched southwest to Romsey where his soldiers defaced the abbey and destroyed its organ. A skirmish on Middle Bridge, downstream of Sadler's Mill, may have preceded these events. =18th to 20th centuries= The town's woollen industry struggled through the 18th century, with competition from the North effectively halving the wages of woollen workers in the southern and eastern parts of the country by the 1770s. As the townspeople looked for more stable work in burgeoning industries like brewing, papermaking and sackmaking, Romsey continued to grow as a modern market town. In 1794 a canal was dug from Redbridge to Andover, passing through Romsey and thus improving its access to nearby trade centres. The town's population was 4,274 in the first census of 1801. Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century British prime minister, lived at Broadlands in his autumn years. In the 1850s he delivered a number of political and religious lectures about the town, including one to the Labourers' Encouragement Society in 1859. Though he had hoped to be buried at Romsey Abbey, he was in 1865 given a state funeral and subsequently buried at Westminster Abbey. His statue, sculpted by Matthew Noble, has stood in Market Place since 1857. Despite the arrival of the railway in 1847, the town's expansion slowed in the mid-19th century. Whilst its population had grown to 5,654 in 1851, it stagnated in subsequent decades and‚Äîby the time of the 1901 census‚Äîthe population was just 5,597. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Romsey became known for making Berthon Boats, a type of collapsible lifeboat invented by Edward Lyon Berthon in 1851. In 1873, having been the vicar of Romsey Abbey since 1860, Berthon erected a shed outside the nearby vicarage to meet the increasing demand for collapsible boats in the 1870s. In 1877 he appointed his son as manager and moved the enterprise to Lortemore Place. The boatyard continued to make boats until 1917, when it became Berthon Boat Co. and relocated to Lymington. The abbey installed a window commemorating Berthon in 1902. With Romsey's expansion as a brewing town in the mid-19th century, it became known for its extraordinary number of pubs and, more generally, its fashionable drinking culture. By 1911 it boasted more than 80 public houses, twice the national average and effectively one pub for every 151.5 residents. Based on the old Hampshire saying so drunk he must have been to Romsey, a book of the same name was published in 1974 as a comprehensive guide to the town's drinking establishments. Statue of Lord Palmerston The Willis Fleming family of North Stoneham Park were major landowners at Romsey from the 17th until early 20th centuries, and were lords of the manors of Romsey Infra and Romsey Extra. Broadlands later became the home of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, known locally as 'Lord Louis'. In 1947 he was given his earldom and the lesser title of Baron Romsey, of Romsey in the County of Southampton. Mountbatten was buried in Romsey Abbey after being killed in an IRA bomb explosion in Ireland on 27 August 1979. After his death his titles passed to his elder daughter, Lady Brabourne, who thus became Countess Mountbatten of Burma. Her eldest son was styled by the courtesy title 'Lord Romsey' until he inherited the title of Lord Brabourne in 2005, and then the earldom in 2017.BBC News (2005).Death on the Nile producer dies Retrieved 1 November 2007 Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was Mountbatten's nephew and, when he married Elizabeth II on 20 November 1947, the pair departed London by train and spent their honeymoon at Broadlands.

Elements of the old Saxon church remain, including an exposed north transept and a 10th-century rood. The current abbey is the largest parish church in Hampshire and is generally regarded as cathedral-like by architects and observers. It is open daily to visitors. = Broadlands = Broadlands is an 18th-century country house located just outside the town centre. It was designed in the Palladian style by the famous architect Capability Brown before being completed by Henry Holland in 1788. It has had a number of illustrious occupants, including Lord Palmerston and Louis Mountbatten. Broadlands has been the setting of two royal honeymoons, namely those of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1947 and then Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1981. The house itself is a Grade I listed building and the surrounding gardens are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Both are open to visitors on weekday afternoons in summer.King John's House =King John's House= King John's House is a 13th-century building that allegedly served as a hunting lodge for King John when he hunted in the nearby New Forest. This is unlikely, however, since it was built in 1256 and therefore 40 years after the king's death, though there is evidence that the beams were reused from an earlier structure.http://www.hampshire- history.com/king-johns-house-romsey/ The original building and adjoining Tudor cottage have a number of unusual historical features, including 14th-century wall decorations and graffiti, a floor made from cattle metapodials, and a traditional monastic garden. Locals claim the house is haunted, with the Hampshire Ghost Society encountering a shrouded figure during their investigations between 2002 and 2008. The house is a Grade I listed building. = Embley Park = Embley Park, a country estate located on the outskirts of Romsey, was the home of Florence Nightingale from 1825 to her death in 1910. Known as the founder of modern nursing and for her work in sanitary reform, Nightingale is said to have received her calling from God in 1837 whilst sitting beneath a large cedar tree on the grounds. While a manor in Embley belonged to Romsey Abbey as early as the 10th century, the current building is of 18th- and 19th-century origin. The site is now home to Embley, an independent school. It is a Grade II listed building. =The White Horse Hotel= The White Horse Hotel is a Grade II listed, 18th-century coaching inn whose timber frames date back to the 1450s. Its medieval stone cellars indicate that the site may have hosted guests to Romsey Abbey as early as the 12th century.http://www.thewhitehorseromsey.co.uk/history/ The existing assembly rooms are said to be where Lord Palmerston first engaged in political debate in the early 1800s. The building housed a hotel and brasserie, which until 2019, was owned and operated by Silks Hotels. =Sadler's Mill= Sadler's Mill The existence of Sadler's Mill, the only mill to be developed on the main course of the River Test, is first recorded in the 16th century, when it functioned as a corn and grist mill. It was at one time owned by Lord Palmerston and later the Broadlands estate before passing to various private owners. Milling ceased in 1932 and the building was left derelict for many years until its restoration in 2005. Carbon dating during this restoration placed the earlier structure in the mid-17th century. It is a Grade II listed building. =The Plaza= The Plaza, in Winchester Road, is a fully equipped 230-seat art deco style theatre, originally built as a cinema in the 1930s.

The A36 runs a few miles west of the town, providing a direct but not particularly quick route to the West of England and South Wales. There are cycle links to Southampton and Salisbury via route 24 of the National Cycle Network. Romsey has a railway station with frequent services (operated by Great Western Railway) running on the route between Portsmouth and Cardiff, via Southampton, Salisbury and Bristol. In 2004, an hourly South West Trains local service was introduced, running to Chandler's Ford and Eastleigh and then down to Southampton and Totton. The noise from these new services attracted complaints from local residents, who demanded their withdrawal, and there were also suggestions that some of the journeys regularly carried no passengers. However, its future is assured under the new South West Trains franchise, which saw the service altered from December 2007 to run from Romsey to Southampton via Eastleigh as currently, then back to Romsey via Millbrook and Redbridge and on to Salisbury. The result is more train services for Romsey than at any other time in its history, with particular improvements for passengers travelling to Southampton or Salisbury. A dedicated shuttle bus linking Romsey with fast London trains at Winchester was discontinued in 2009 despite a campaign to save the service.Campaign to save bus defeated Romsey Advertiser, 9 November 2007 Other bus services are provided by Wilts & Dorset within the town and to Salisbury, Bluestar to Southampton and Eastleigh and Stagecoach within the town and to Winchester.

The conflict was between Commonwealth armed forces and pro-independence fighters of the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the military wing of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). The war was fought over attempts by communist forces to gain independence for Malaya from the British Empire and to establish a socialist economy. The fighting spanned both the colonial period and the creation of an independent Malaya (1957). Although it was referred to as \\"The Emergency\\" by colonial authorities, the MNLA referred to it as the \\"Anti-British National Liberation War\\". The conflict was called an \\"Emergency\\" by the British for insurance purposes, as London-based insurers would not have paid out in instances of civil wars. In June 1948 the colonial government declared a state of emergency in British Malaya after the killing of three Europeans during attacks on plantations. Under the leadership of Chin Peng, communist activists regrouped in the Malayan jungles and formed the MNLA to wage a guerrilla war against British colonial rule. Many of the MNLA fighters who fought against British colonialism were former members of the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) who had been trained and funded by the British years prior to fight against the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War. The majority of the support for the communist rebels came from the ethnic Malayan-Chinese population, most of which lived in dire poverty, were subject to racial persecution and were barred from voting in elections. The communists belief in gender equality allowed many women to join the MNLA and their civilian support network, the Min Yuen. However, with the exception of the Orang Asli aboriginals, the MNLA failed to gain any major following from any ethnic groups other than the Malayan-Chinese due to the association of communism with China and long-standing racial tensions within Malaya. After the MNLA had established a series of jungle bases, they began conducting raids on British colonial police and military installations. Tin mines and rubber plantations also became frequent targets of communist sabotage in attempts to make the colonial occupation of Malaya too expensive for the British to maintain. British military experiences during the Emergency would lay the groundwork for future anti-insurgency operations, most famously in the Vietnam War as American forces (largely unsuccessfully) attempted to replicate British strategies used in Malaya. The operational tactics of the Commonwealth troops pioneered the concept of Search and destroy, saw widespread use of Agent Orange and popularised the term \\"Hearts and Minds\\". High emphasis was placed on rapid response units that could respond quickly to guerrilla attacks and the formation of local auxiliary forces. Under the Briggs Plan the British created a system of 400 internment camps called \\"New villages\\" to imprison over 400,000 civilians, mostly Chinese but also Indian and Orang Asli, in an attempt to segregate the MNLA guerrillas from the civilian population. The British then attempted to starve the communist guerrillas by implementing a food denial campaign by enforcing food rationing on civilians, killing livestock and using chemical herbicides to destroy rural farmland. As the conflict began, earlier attempts to defeat the communists unintentionally included the execution of unarmed villagers, the most infamous case being the Batang Kali massacre which is often referred to as \\"Britain's My Lai\\". Despite the war ending in 1960, communist leader Chin Peng renewed the insurgency against the Malaysian government in 1967. This second phase of the insurgency lasted until 1989. Origins =Economic issues= The Malayan economy relied on the export of tin and rubber, and was therefore vulnerable to any shifts in the world market. When the British took control of the Malayan economy, they imposed taxes on some Malayan goods, affecting their traditional industries. This led to an increase in poverty for the Malayan people.Wendy Khadijah Moore, Malaysia a Pictorial History 1400‚Äì2004, ed. Dianne Buerger and Sharon Ham (n.p.: Archipelago Press, 2004), page 194 Many Chinese people found employment in tin mines or fields responsible for the trade of materials. This heightened inter-ethnic tensions as the Malay people found that ethnic Chinese had replaced them in certain jobs and work became more difficult to find. This forced many Malays into the rubber industry, which in turn was heavily dependent upon volatile world prices. Economic tension intensified during the Second World War. The Japanese occupation of Malaya began in 1941 and from that point onwards the \\"export of primary products was limited to the relatively small amounts required for the Japanese economy.\\" This led to large areas of rubber plantations being abandoned and many mines closing. The latter was progressively affected by a shortage of spare parts for machines. Rice imports, which made up a large portion of the Malayan diet, fell rapidly due to limited trade and thus the population was forced to focus their efforts on subsistence. The withdrawal of Japan at the end of World War II left the British Malayan economy disrupted. Problems included unemployment, low wages, and high levels of food inflation, well above the healthy rate of 2‚Äì3%. The Malayan Communist Party began to use the failing economy as a tool of propaganda against the British. The British had not addressed the underlying economic problems that were now worse within Malaya than they had ever been. There was considerable labour unrest and a large number of strikes occurred between 1946 and 1948. One example of this was a 24-hour general strike organised by the MCP on 29 January 1946.Eric Stahl, \\"Doomed from the Start: A New Perspective on the Malayan Insurgency\\" (master's thesis, 2003) During this time, the British administration was attempting to organise Malaya's economy, as revenue from Malaya's tin and rubber industries was important to Britain's own post-war recovery. Protesters were dealt with harshly, by measures including arrests and deportations. In turn, protesters became increasingly militant. In 1947, alone, the communists in Malaya organised a further 300 strikes. The British authorities had attempted, immediately after the war, to form the Malayan Union ‚Äì a state where all citizens, Malay, Chinese and Indian, would have equal rights. This was rejected by many ethnic Malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective British control. Consequently, the British withdrew the proposal and for many Chinese in particular, this appeared as a betrayal after their community had borne the brunt of fighting the Japanese occupation. =First incidents= The first shots of the Malayan Emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 June 1948, in the office of the Elphil Estate twenty miles east of the Sungai Siput town, Perak. Three European plantation managers, Arthur Walker (50 yrs, manager), John Allison (55 yrs, manager) and his young assistant, Ian Christian, were killed by three young Chinese men. These planned attacks were to include a fourth European on an estate near Sungai Siput. This attack failed as their target could not arrive to work on time due to his jeep breaking down. More gunmen were sent to kill him but shortly departed after failing to find him. Souchou Yao. 2016. The Malayan Emergency A small, Distant War. Nordic Institute of Asian Studies Monograph series, no. 133. pp. 40‚Äì41. Two days later (June 18), the British enacted emergency measures into law, first in Perak in response to the Sungai Siput incident. These emergency measures then became country-wide in July. Under these measures many trade unions, Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and other leftist parties were outlawed. The police were given the power to detain communists and those suspected of assisting them. =Formation of the MNLA= Led by Chin Peng the remaining Malayan communists retreated to rural areas and formed the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), although their name has commonly been mistranslated as the Malayan Races Liberation Army (MRLA) or the Malayan People's Liberation Army (MPLA). Peng was a veteran anti-fascist and trade unionist who had played an integral role in the MPAJA communist resistance against the Japanese occupation of Malaya during WWII. The MNLA began their war for Malayan independence by targeting the colonial resource extraction industries; mainly the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the British occupation of Malaya. The MNLA attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the British and winning independence by making the colonial occupation too expensive to maintain. The MNLA launched their first guerrilla attacks in the Gua Musang district. The MNLA was partly a re-formation of the Malayan Peoples' Anti- Japanese Army (MPAJA), the MCP-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in Malaya against the Japanese occupation. The British had secretly helped form the MPAJA in 1942 and trained them in the use of explosives, firearms and radios. Disbanded in December 1945, the MPAJA officially turned in its weapons to the British Military Administration, although many MPAJA soldiers secretly hid stockpiles of weapons in jungle hideouts. Members who agreed to disband were offered economic incentives. Around 4,000 members rejected these incentives and went underground. Guerrilla war Bren gun and receive a $1,000 reward The MNLA commonly employed guerrilla tactics, sabotaging installations, attacking rubber plantations and destroying transportation and infrastructure. Support for the MNLA was mainly based on around 500,000 of the 3.12 million ethnic Chinese then living in Malaya. These Chinese have been referred to as 'squatters', and the majority of them were farmers living on the edge of the jungles where the MNLA were based. This allowed the MNLA to supply themselves with food, in particular, as well as providing a source of new recruits. The ethnic Malay population supported them in smaller numbers. The MNLA gained the support of the Chinese because they were denied the equal right to vote in elections, had no land rights to speak of, and were usually very poor. The MNLA's supply organisation was called \\"Min Yuen\\" (Mass Organisation). It had a network of contacts within the general population. Besides supplying material, especially food, it was also important to the MNLA as a source of intelligence. The MNLA's camps and hideouts were in the rather inaccessible tropical jungle with limited infrastructure. Most MNLA guerrillas were ethnic Chinese, though there were some Malays, Indonesians and Indians among its members. The MNLA was organised into regiments, although these had no fixed establishments and each encompassed all forces operating in a particular region. The regiments had political sections, commissars, instructors and secret service. In the camps, the soldiers attended lectures on Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, and produced political newsletters to be distributed to civilians. The MNLA also stipulated that their soldiers needed official permission for any romantic involvement with civilian women. In the early stages of the conflict, the guerrillas envisaged establishing control in \\"liberated areas\\" from which the government forces had been driven, but did not succeed in this. =British response= Workers on a rubber plantation in Malaya travel to work under the protection of Special Constables, whose function was to guard them throughout the working day against attack by communist forces, 1950. In the early months, chaos and lack of direction immobilized the government. On the military front, the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the Chinese rural population. British planters and miners, who bore the brunt of the communist attacks, began to talk about government incompetence and being betrayed by Whitehall.Souchou Yao. 2016. The Malayan Emergency A Small Distant War. Nordic Institute of Asian Studies Monograph series, no. 133. p. 43. The initial government strategy was primarily to guard important economic targets, such as mines and plantation estates. Later, in April 1950, General Sir Harold Briggs, the British Army's Director of Operations was appointed to Malaya. The central tenet of the Briggs' Plan was that the best way to defeat an insurgency, such as the government was facing, was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters amongst the population. The Briggs plan also recognised the inhospitable nature of the Malayan jungle. A major part of the strategy involved targeting the MNLA food supply, which Briggs recognised came from three main sources: camps within the Malayan jungle where land was cleared to provide food, aboriginal jungle dwellers who could supply the MNLA with food gathered within the jungle, and the MNLA supporters within the 'squatter' communities on the edge of the jungle. A wounded insurgent being held and questioned after his capture in 1952 The Briggs Plan was multifaceted, with one aspect which has become particularly well known: the forced relocation of some 500,000 rural Malayans, including 400,000 Chinese, from squatter communities on the fringes of the forests into guarded camps called \\"new villages\\". These villages were newly constructed in most cases, and were surrounded by barbed wire, police posts, and floodlit areas, meant to keep the inhabitants in and the guerrillas out. At the start of the Emergency, the British had 13 infantry battalions in Malaya, including seven partly formed Gurkha battalions, three British battalions, two battalions of the Royal Malay Regiment and a British Royal Artillery Regiment being used as infantry.Karl Hack, Defense & Decolonization in South-East Asia, p. 113. This force was too small to fight the insurgents effectively, and more infantry battalions were needed in Malaya. The British brought in soldiers from units such as the Royal Marines and King's African Rifles. Another effort was a re-formation of the Special Air Service in 1950 as a specialised reconnaissance, raiding, and counter-insurgency unit. The Permanent Secretary of Defence for Malaya, Sir Robert Grainger Ker Thompson, had served in the Chindits in Burma during World War II. His vast experience in jungle warfare proved valuable during this period as he was able to build effective civil-military relations and was one of the chief architects of the counter-insurgency plan in Malaya.Joel E. Hamby. \\"Civil-military operations: joint doctrine and the Malayan Emergency\\", Joint Force Quarterly, Autumn 2002, Paragraph 3,4 On 6 October 1951, the British High Commissioner in Malaya, Sir Henry Gurney, was assassinated, and Briggs left the following December. Churchill's Conservative Party then regained power in Whitehall. In January 1952, General Gerald Templer was appointed as British High Commissioner. He is widely credited with turning the situation in favour of the British forces. Some British army units began a \\"hearts and minds campaign\\" by giving medical and food aid to Malays and indigenous tribes. At the same time, they put pressure on the MNLA by patrolling the jungle. The MNLA guerrillas were driven deeper into the jungle and denied resources. The MNLA extorted food from the Sakai and thereby earned their enmity. Many of the captured guerrillas changed sides. In comparison, the MNLA never released any Britons alive. During Templer's two-year command, 'two-thirds of the guerrillas were wiped out and lost over half their strength, the incident rate fell from 500 to less than 100 per month and the civilian and security force casualties from 200 to less than 40.' Orthodox historiography suggests that Templer changed the situation in the Emergency and his actions and policies were a major part of British success under his command. Revisionist historians have challenged this view and frequently support the ideas of Victor Purcell, a Sinologist who as early as 1954 claimed that Templer merely continued policies begun by his predecessors. In the end, the conflict involved a maximum of 40,000 British and other Commonwealth troops, against a peak of about 7‚Äì8,000 communist guerrillas. =Control of anti-guerrilla operations= Police officers question a civilian during the Malayan Emergency. At all levels of government (national, state, and district levels), the military and civil authority was assumed by a committee of military, police and civilian administration officials. This allowed intelligence from all sources to be rapidly evaluated and disseminated and also allowed all anti-guerrilla measures to be co- ordinated. Each State War Executive Committee, for example, included the State Chief Minister as chairman, the Chief Police Officer, the senior military commander, state home guard officer, state financial officer, state information officer, executive secretary, and up to six selected community leaders. The Police, Military, and Home Guard representatives and the Secretary formed the operations sub-committee responsible for the day-to-day direction of emergency operations. The operations subcommittees as a whole made joint decisions.Conduct of Anti-Terrorist Operations in Malaya, Director of Operations, Malaya, 1958, Chapter III: Own Forces =Nature of warfare= Temenggor, 1953 The British Army soon realised that clumsy sweeps by large formations were unproductive. Instead, platoons or sections carried out patrols and laid ambushes, based on intelligence (from informers, surrendered MNLA personnel, aerial reconnaissance, etc.). A typical operation was \\"Nassau\\", carried out in the Kuala Langat swamp (excerpt from the Marine Corps School's The Guerrilla ‚Äì and how to Fight Him): Commonwealth contribution In addition to British and Malayan units and personnel, a range of Commonwealth forces were also involved, including Australian, New Zealand, Fijian, Kenyan, Nyasaland, and Northern and Southern Rhodesians. =Australia= The first Australian ground forces, the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR), arrived in 1955. The battalion was later replaced by 3 RAR, which in turn was replaced by 1 RAR. The Royal Australian Air Force contributed No. 1 Squadron (Avro Lincoln bombers) and No. 38 Squadron (C-47 transports), operating out of Singapore, early in the conflict. In 1955, the RAAF extended Butterworth air base, from which Canberra bombers of No. 2 Squadron (replacing No. 1 Squadron) and CAC Sabres of No. 78 Wing carried out ground attack missions against the guerillas.

Between 1956 and 1960, the aircraft carriers and and destroyers , , , , , , , and were attached to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve forces for three to nine months at a time. Several of the destroyers fired on communist positions in Johor State. =New Zealand= A total of 1,300 New Zealanders served in the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1964, and fifteen lost their lives. New Zealand's first contribution came in 1949, when C-47 Dakotas of RNZAF No. 41 Squadron were attached to the Royal Air Force's Far East Air Force. New Zealand became more directly involved in the conflict in 1955; from May, RNZAF de Havilland Vampires and Venoms began to fly strike missions. In November 1955 133 soldiers of what was to become the Special Air Service of New Zealand arrived from Singapore, for training in-country with the British SAS, beginning operations by April 1956. The Royal New Zealand Air Force continued to carry out strike missions with Venoms of No. 14 SquadronIan McGibbon (Ed.), (2000).

The men wear khaki shirts and shorts with long, dark- coloured socks. They all wear dark berets. Southern Rhodesia and its successor, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, contributed two units to Malaya. Between 1951 and 1953, white Southern Rhodesian volunteers formed \\"C\\" Squadron of the Special Air Service.; The Rhodesian African Rifles, comprising black soldiers and warrant officers but led by white officers, served in Johore state for two years from 1956. =Fiji= During the four years of Fijian involvement, from 1952 to 1956, some 1,600 Fijian troops served. The first to arrive were the 1st Battalion, Fiji Infantry Regiment. Twenty-five Fijian troops died in combat in Malaya. Friendships on and off the battlefield developed between the two nations; the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, became a friend and mentor to Ratu Sir Edward Cakobau, who was a commander of the Fijian Battalion, and who later went on to become the Deputy PM of Fiji and whose son Brigadier General Ratu Epeli was the former President of Fiji. The experience was captured in the documentary, Back to Batu Pahat. =Kenya, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland= The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of the King's African Rifles from Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and Kenya respectively also served there suffering 23 losses. Resolution On 6 October 1951, the MNLA ambushed and killed the British High Commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney. The killing has been described as a major factor in causing the Malayan population to roundly reject the MNLA campaign, and also as leading to widespread fear due to the perception that \\"if even the High Commissioner was no longer safe, there was little hope of protection and safety for the man-in-the-street in Malaya.\\" More recently, MNLA leader Chin Peng stated that the killing had little effect and that the communists anyway radically altered their strategy that month in their \\"October Resolutions\\". The October Resolutions, a response to the Briggs Plan, involved a change of tactics by reducing attacks on economic targets and civilians, increasing efforts to go into political organisation and subversion, and bolstering the supply network from the Min Yuen as well as jungle farming. Headline on page 1 of The Straits Times of . Chin Peng: Public Enemy No.1 Gurney's successor, Lieutenant General Gerald Templer, was instructed by the British government to push for immediate measures to give Chinese ethnic residents the right to vote. =Government's declaration of amnesty= On 8 September 1955, the Government of the Federation of Malaya issued a declaration of amnesty to the communists.Memorandum from the Chief Minister and Minister for Internal and Security, No. 386/17/56, 30 April 1956. CO1030/30 The Government of Singapore issued an identical offer at the same time. Tunku Abdul Rahman, as Chief Minister, made good the offer of an amnesty but promised there would be no negotiations with the MNLA. The terms of the amnesty were: * Those of you who come in and surrender will not be prosecuted for any offence connected with the Emergency, which you have committed under Communist direction, either before this date or in ignorance of this declaration. * You may surrender now and to whom you like including to members of the public. * There will be no general \\"ceasefire\\" but the security forces will be on alert to help those who wish to accept this offer and for this purpose local \\"ceasefire\\" will be arranged. * The Government will conduct investigations on those who surrender. Those who show that they are genuinely intent to be loyal to the Government of Malaya and to give up their Communist activities will be helped to regain their normal position in society and be reunited with their families. As regards the remainder, restrictions will have to be placed on their liberty but if any of them wish to go to China, their request will be given due consideration.Prof Madya Dr. Nik Anuar Nik Mahmud, Tunku Abdul Rahman and His Role in the Baling Talks Following the declaration, an intensive publicity campaign on an unprecedented scale was launched by the government. Alliance Ministers in the Federal Government travelled extensively up and down the country exhorting the people to call upon the communists to lay down their arms and take advantage of the amnesty. Despite the campaign, few Communists surrendered to the authorities. Some critics in the political circles commented that the amnesty was too restrictive and little more than a restatement of the surrender terms which had been in force for a long period. The critics advocated a more realistic and liberal approach of direct negotiations with the MCP to work out a settlement of the issue. Leading officials of the Labour Party had, as part of the settlement, not excluded the possibility of recognition of the MCP as a political organisation. Within the Alliance itself, influential elements in both the MCA and UMNO were endeavouring to persuade the Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, to hold negotiations with the MCP. =Baling talks and their consequences= British artillery firing on an insurgent hide-out in the Malayan jungle, 1955 Realising that his conflict had not come to any fruition, Chin Peng sought a discussion with the ruling British government alongside many Malayan officials in 1955. The talks took place in the Government English School at Baling on 28 December. Chin Ping walked out from the jungle and tried to negotiate with the leader of the Federation, but the British Intelligence Service worried that the MCP would regain influence in society. The MCP was represented by Chin Peng, the Secretary-General, Rashid Maidin and Chen Tien, head of the MCP's Central Propaganda Department; on the other side were three elected national representatives, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Dato' Tan Cheng-Lock and David Saul Marshall, the Chief Minister of Singapore. The meeting was intended to pursue a mutual end to the conflict but the Malayan government representatives, led by Tunku Abdul Rahman, dismissed all of Chin Peng's demands. As a result, the conflict heightened, and, in response, New Zealand sent NZSAS soldiers, No. 14 Squadron RNZAF, No. 41 (Bristol Freighter) Squadron RNZAF and, later, No. 75 Squadron RNZAF; other Commonwealth members also sent troops to aid the British. Following the failure of the talks, Tunku decided to withdraw the amnesty on 8 February 1956, five months after it had been offered, stating that he would not be willing to meet the Communists again unless they indicated beforehand their desire to see him with a view to making \\"a complete surrender\\".MacGillivray to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, 15 March 1956, CO1030/22 Despite the failure of the talks, the MCP made every effort to resume peace talks with the Malayan government, without success. Meanwhile, discussions began in the new Emergency Operations Council to intensify the \\"People's War\\" against the guerillas. In July 1957, a few weeks before independence, the MCP made another attempt at peace talks, suggesting the following conditions for a negotiated peace: * its members should be given privileges enjoyed by citizens; and * a guarantee that political as well as armed members of the MCP would not be punished. The failure of the talks affected MCP policy. At the same time, the strength of the MNLA and 'Min Yuen' declined to only 1830 members in August 1957. Those who remained faced going into exile, or death in the jungle. Tunku Abdul Rahman, however, did not respond to the MCP's proposals. With the independence of Malaya under Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman on 31 August 1957, the insurrection lost its rationale as a war of colonial liberation. The last serious resistance from MRLA guerrillas ended with a surrender in the Telok Anson marsh area in 1958. The remaining MRLA forces fled to the Thai border and further east. On 31 July 1960 the Malayan government declared the state of emergency was over, and Chin Peng left south Thailand for Beijing where he was accommodated by the Chinese authorities in the International Liaison Bureau, where many other Southeast Asian Communist Party leaders were housed. Casualties During the conflict, security forces killed 6,710 MRLA guerrillas and captured 1,287, while 2,702 guerrillas surrendered during the conflict, and approximately 500 more did so at its conclusion. 1,345 Malayan troops and police were killed during the fighting, as well as 519 Commonwealth personnel. 2,478 civilians were killed, with another 810 recorded as missing. War crimes War crimes have been broadly defined by the Nuremberg Principles as \\"violations of the laws or customs of war,\\" which includes massacres, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, mutilation, torture, and the murder of detainees and prisoners of war. Additional common crimes include theft, arson, and the destruction of property not warranted by military necessity. =Torture= During the Malayan conflict, there were instances during operations to find insurgents where British troops detained and tortured villagers who were suspected of aiding the insurgents. Brian Lapping said that there was \\"some vicious conduct by the British forces, who routinely beat up Chinese squatters when they refused, or possibly were unable, to give information\\" about the insurgents. The Scotsman newspaper lauded these tactics as a good practice since \\"simple-minded peasants are told and come to believe that the communist leaders are invulnerable\\". Some civilians and detainees were also shot, either because they attempted to flee from and potentially aid insurgents or simply because they refused to give intelligence to British forces. These tactics strained relations between civilians and British forces in Malaya and were therefore counterproductive in generating the one resource critical in a counterinsurgency, good intelligence.The Other Forgotten War: Understanding Atrocities During the Malayan Emergency British troops were often unable to tell the difference between enemy combatants and non-combatant civilians while conducting military operations through the jungles, due to the fact the guerrillas wore civilian clothing and had support from sympathetic civilian populations. Malayan Communist terrorists, aka CT's were also fond of utilising torture as a method to enforce and coerce the local Malay and aboriginal population. During 14 days of the Malayan Communist Party rule, after the surrender of Japanese, many Malay villages were raided ransacked leading to countless unlawful killings and seizures of property. The population of these villages was forced to endure austere conditions, the occasionally killing, and, as previously mentioned, theft was rampant. Some theorise that this hostility against Malays was born out of a desire for revenge as under Japanese administration, and equally, Malay administration (subservient to the Colonial administration), the ethnic Chinese was, to some degree, mistreated. Although largest undocumented, there are records to suggest that underaged aboriginal children were forced, or coerced to serve amongst the Communist terrorists. =Batang Kali Massacre= In the \\"Batang Kali massacre\\", 24 villagers were killed by 7th Platoon, G Company, 2nd Scots Guards, after they surrounded a rubber plantation at Sungai Rimoh near Batang Kali in Selangor in December 1948. Many of the victims' bodies were found to have been mutilated and their village of Batang Kali was burned to the ground. No weapons were found when the village was searched. The only survivor of the killings was a man named Chong Hong who was in his 20s at the time. He fainted and was presumed dead. The massacre later became the focus of decades of legal battles between the UK government and the families of the civilians executed by British troops. =Decapitations and mutilation= Decapitation and mutilation of suspected insurgents by British forces were also common as a way to identify dead guerrillas when it was not possible to bring their corpses in from the jungle. A photograph of a Royal Marine commando holding two insurgents' heads caused a public outcry in April 1952. Initially an Admiralty spokesman claimed that the decapitation photos were fake; however, soon after Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton (after confirmation from Gerald Templer) confirmed to parliament that the photos were indeed genuine. The Colonial Office privately noted that \\"there is no doubt that under international law a similar case in wartime would be a war crime\\". There were also cases of dead guerrillas being exhibited in public for identification, and to potentially entrap grieving associates. =Use of internment camps/\\"New Villages\\"= As part of the Briggs' Plan devised by British General Sir Harold Briggs, 500,000 people (roughly ten percent of Malaya's population) were eventually removed from the land. Tens of thousands of homes were destroyed, and many people were interned in guarded camps called \\"new villages\\". The intent of this measure was to inflict collective punishment on villages where people were deemed to be aiding the insurgents and to isolate civilians from guerrilla activity. While considered necessary, some of the cases involving the widespread destruction went beyond the justification of military necessity. This practice was prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and customary international law, which stated that the destruction of property must not happen unless rendered absolutely necessary by military operations. =Other= From 18 June 1948 up until 15 April 1950, 35,000 people were exiled, including those unable to leave the country.Chin, C. (2012). Dialogues with Chin Peng: New Light on the Malayan Communist Party. Chinese Edition. Comparisons with Vietnam =Differences= 1st Battalion Somerset Light Infantry used in the emergency The conflicts in Malaya and Vietnam have been compared many times and it has been asked by historians how a British force of 35,000 succeeded where over half a million U.S. and allied soldiers failed in a smaller area. The two conflicts differ in several key points. * Whereas the MNLA never numbered more than about 8,000 insurgents, the People's Army of (North) Vietnam fielded over a quarter-million soldiers, in addition to roughly 100,000 National Liberation Front (or Vietcong) guerillas. * The combined support of the Soviet Union, North Korea, CubaBourne, Peter G. Fidel: A Biography of Fidel Castro (1986) p. 255; Coltman, Leycester The Real Fidel Castro (2003) p. 211 and the People's Republic of China (PRC) provided large amounts of the latest military hardware, logistical support, personnel and training to North Vietnam. * North Vietnam's shared border with its ally China (PRC) allowed for continuous assistance and resupply. * Britain never approached the Emergency as a conventional conflict and quickly implemented an effective combined intelligence (led by the Malayan Police Special Branch against the political arm of the guerrilla movement)Comber (2006), Malaya's Secret Police 1945‚Äì60. The Role of the Special Branch in the Malayan Emergency Cited at length in Vietnam War essay on Insurgency and Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya, eHistory, Ohio State University. and a hearts and minds operation. * Most of the insurgents were ethnically Chinese and drew support from sections of the Chinese community, but the more numerous indigenous Malays, many of whom were animated by anti-Chinese sentiments, were loyal to the government and enlisted at high-rates into the security services. * Many Malayans had fought side by side with the British against the Japanese occupation in World War II, including Chin Peng. This is in contrast to Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) where French colonial officials had not been at war against the Japanese, who endeavoured to excite Vietnamese nationalism against France. This factor of trust between the locals and the colonials was what gave the British an advantage over the French and later, the Americans in Vietnam, neither of whom enjoyed such trust from the Vietnamese . * In purely military terms, the British Army recognised that in a low-intensity war, the individual soldier's skill and endurance was of far greater importance than overwhelming firepower (artillery, air support, etc.) Even though many British soldiers were conscripted National Servicemen, the necessary skills and attitudes were taught at a Jungle Warfare School, which also worked out the optimum tactics based on experience gained in the field. * In Vietnam, soldiers and supplies passed through external countries such as Laos and Cambodia where US forces were not legally permitted to enter. This allowed Vietnamese Communist troops safe haven from US ground attacks. The MNLA had only a border with Thailand, where they were forced to take shelter near the end of the conflict. =Similarities= Many tactics used by the Americans in Vietnam were similar to those used by the British in Malaya. Some examples are listed below. Agent Orange During the Malayan Emergency, Britain was the first nation to employ the use of herbicides and defoliants to destroy bushes, food crops, and trees to deprive the insurgents of cover and as part of the food denial campaign in the early 1950s. The 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D (Agent Orange) were used to clear lines of communication and wipe out food crops as part of this strategy and in 1952, trioxone, and mixtures of the aforementioned herbicides, were sent along a number of key roads. From June to October 1952, 1,250 acres of roadside vegetation at possible ambush points were sprayed with defoliant, described as a policy of \\"national importance\\". The British reported that the use of herbicides and defoliants could be effectively replaced by removing vegetation by hand and the spraying was stopped. However, after this strategy failed, the use of herbicides and defoliants in effort to fight the insurgents was restarted under the command of British General Sir Gerald Templer in February 1953, as a means of destroying food crops grown by communist forces in jungle clearings. Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft despatched STCA and Trioxaone, along with pellets of chlorophenyl N,N-Dimethyl-1-naphthylamine onto crops such as sweet potatoes and maize. Many Commonwealth personnel who handled and/or used Agent Orange during, and in the decades after, the conflict suffered from serious exposure to dioxin and Agent Orange. An estimated 10,000 civilians and insurgents in Malaya also suffered heavily from the effects of the defoliant (though many historians agree it was likely more than this number given that Agent Orange was used on a large scale in the Malayan conflict and unlike the US, the British government manipulated the numbers and kept its secret very tight in fear of negative world public opinion). The prolonged absence of vegetation from defoliation had also resulted in major soil erosion to areas of Malaya. After the Malayan conflict ended in 1960, the US considered British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a legally accepted tactic of warfare. Secretary of State Dean Rusk advised President John F. Kennedy that the precedent of using herbicide in warfare had been established by the British through their use of aircraft to spray herbicide and thus destroy enemy crops and thin the thick jungle of northern Malaya. Aerial bombardment Like the US Air Force in Vietnam, widespread saturation bombardment was used by the Royal Air Force throughout the conflict in Malaya. Britain conducted 4,500 airstrikes in the first five years of the Malayan war. Mapping was poor, communications were abysmal, the meteorology was unfavourable and airfields were few. Buzzing likely enemy positions was used (the modern 'show of force'), and the bombing of potential escape routes was also occasionally practised. Author Robert Jackson said that: \\"During 1956, some 545,000 lb. of bombs had been dropped on a supposed guerrilla encampment. but a lack of accurate pinpoints had nullified the effect. The camp was again attacked at the beginning of May 1957, dropping a total of 94,000 lb. of bombs, but because of inaccurate target information, this weight of explosive was 250 yards off target. Then, on 15 May. 70,000 lb. of bombs were dropped\\". \\"The attack was entirely successful\\", Jackson declares, since \\"four terrorists were killed\\". The author also notes that a 500 lb. nose-fused bomb was employed from August 1948 and had a mean area of effectiveness of 15,000 square feet. \\"Another very viable weapon\\" was the 20 lb. fragmentation bomb, a forerunner of cluster bombs. \\"Since a Sunderland could carry a load of 190, its effect on terrorist morale was considerable\\", Jackson states. \\"Unfortunately, it was not used in great numbers, despite its excellent potential as a harassing weapon\\". On one occasion a Lincoln bomber \\"dropped its bombs 600 yards short. killing twelve civilians and injuring twenty-six others\\". The British reported that bombing jungles was largely a waste of effort due to inaccurate targeting and the inability to confirm if a target was hostile or not. Throughout the 12-year conflict, between 670 and 995 non- combatants were killed by British RAF bombers. Resettlement programme Britain also set up a \\"resettlement\\" programme that provided a model for the US's Strategic Hamlet Program in Vietnam. During the Malayan Emergency, 450 new villages were created and it is estimated that 470,509 people ‚Äì 400,000 Chinese ‚Äì were interned in the resettlement program. A key British war measure was inflicting collective punishments on villages where people were deemed to be aiding the insurgents. At Tanjong Malim in March 1952 Templer imposed a twenty-two-hour house curfew, banned everyone from leaving the village, closed the schools, stopped bus services and reduced the rice rations for 20,000 people. The latter measure prompted the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to write to the Colonial Office noting that the \\"chronically undernourished Malayan\\" might not be able to survive as a result. \\"This measure is bound to result in an increase, not only of sickness but also of deaths, particularly amongst the mothers and very young children\\". Some people were fined for leaving their homes to use external latrines. In another collective punishment ‚Äì at Sengei Pelek the following month ‚Äì measures included a house curfew, a reduction of 40 percent in the rice ration and the construction of a chain-link fence 22 yards outside the existing barbed wire fence around the town. Officials explained that these measures were being imposed upon the 4,000 villagers \\"for their continually supplying food\\" to the insurgents and \\"because they did not give information to the authorities\\". Two suspected guerillas after capture by Jungle Squad officers Search and destroy Like the USA later did in Vietnam, British troops sometimes set fire to villages whose inhabitants were accused of supporting the insurgents, detaining thousands of suspected collaborators, and to deny the insurgents cover. British units that discovered civilians providing assistance to insurgents were to detain and interrogate them, using torture and the threat of violence against family members, to discover the location of insurgent camps. Insurgents had numerous advantages over British forces; they lived in closer proximity to villagers, they sometimes had relatives or close friends in the village, and they were not afraid to threaten violence or torture and murder village leaders as an example to the others, forcing them to assist them with food and information. British forces thus faced a dual-threat: the insurgents and the silent network in villages who supported them. While the insurgents rarely sought out contact with British forces, they did use terrorist tactics to intimidate civilians and elicit material support. British troops often described the terror of jungle patrols; in addition to watching out for insurgent fighters, they had to navigate difficult terrain and avoid dangerous animals and insects. Many patrols would stay in the jungle for days, even weeks, without encountering the enemy, and then, in a brief moment, insurgents would ambush them. British forces, unable to distinguish friend from foe, had to adjust to the constant risk of an insurgent attack. These instances led to the infamous incident at Batang Kali where 24 unarmed villagers were killed by British troops. Legacy National Monument commemorating those who died in Malaysia's struggle for freedom, including the Malayan Emergency The Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation of 1963‚Äì66 arose from tensions between Indonesia and the new British backed Federation of Malaysia that was conceived in the aftermath of the Malayan Emergency. In the late 1960s, the coverage of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War prompted the initiation of investigations in the UK concerning alleged war crimes perpetrated by British forces during the Emergency, such as the Batang Kali massacre. No charges have yet been brought against the British forces involved and claims have been repeatedly dismissed by the British government as propaganda, despite evidence suggestive of a cover-up. The communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968‚Äì89) started following the end of the Malayan Emergency in 1960, when the predominantly ethnic Chinese Malayan National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the MCP, retreated to the Malaysian- Thailand border where it regrouped and retrained for future offensives against the Malaysian government. The insurgency officially began when the MCP ambushed security forces in Kroh‚ÄìBetong, in the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia, on 17 June 1968. The conflict also coincided with renewed tensions between ethnic Malays and Chinese during 13 May Incident in peninsular Malaysia and the Vietnam War. Communist leader Chin Peng spent much of the 1990s and early 2000s working to preserve his perspective of the Emergency. In a collaboration with Australian academics, he met with historians and former Commonwealth military personnel to create a series of meetings which led to the publication of Dialogues with Chin Peng - New Light on the Malayan Communist Party. Peng also travelled to England and teamed up with conservative journalist Ian Ward and his wife Norma Miraflor to create his autobiography Alias Chin Peng: My Side of History. In popular culture In popular Malaysian culture, the Emergency has frequently been portrayed as a primarily Malay struggle against the Communists. This perception has been criticised by some, such as Information Minister Zainuddin Maidin, for not recognising Chinese and Indian efforts.Kaur, Manjit (16 December 2006). \\"Zam: Chinese too fought against communists\\" . The Star. This portrayal also obscures the reality that the Malayan Communist Party in its own way fought for independence from the metropole. In fact, Malays, Orang Asli (indigenous peoples) and Indians also had joined the CPM but were in the minority. The British film industry made a number of films with the background of the Emergency including: * The Planter's Wife (1952) * Windom's Way (1957) * The 7th Dawn (1964) * The Virgin Soldiers (1969) * Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers (1977) Other media: * In The Sweeney episode \\"The Bigger They Are\\" (series 4, episode 8; 26 October 1978), the tycoon Leonard Gold is being blackmailed by Harold Collins, who has a photo of him present at a massacre of civilians in Malaya when he was in the British Army twenty-five years earlier. * Throughout the series Porridge, there are references to Fletcher having served in Malaya, probably as a result of National Service. He regales his fellow inmates with stories of his time there, and in one episode it is revealed that Prison Officer Mackay had also served in Malaya. * The Malayan Trilogy series of novels (1956-1959) by Anthony Burgess is set during the Malayan Emergency.

The Freak Brothers first appeared in The Rag, an underground newspaper published in Austin, Texas, beginning in May 1968, and were regularly reprinted in underground papers around the United States and in other parts of the world. Later their adventures were published in a series of comic books. The lives of the Freak Brothers revolve around the procurement and enjoyment of recreational drugs, particularly marijuana. The comics present a critique of the establishment, while satirizing counterculture. Fat Freddy's Cat appears in many of the stories, spinning off his own cartoon strip (which appeared as part of the Freak Brothers comic page, in the manner of older comic strip double features) and later some full-length episodes. An animated version, The Freak Brothers, was released in 2020.  Comic strips  The Freak Brothers first appeared in The Rag, an underground newspaper published in Austin, Texas, beginning in May 1968. Their debut was in an advertising flyer for a winter 1968 film short called The Texas Hippies March on the Capitol. Additional on December 19, 2016. Freak Brothers strips soon became popular and were regularly reprinted in underground papers around the United States and in other parts of the world. The Freak Brothers' first comic book appearance was in Feds 'n' Heads, self-published by Shelton in the spring of 1968 (and later re-issued in multiple printings by Berkeley's the Print Mint). They also appeared in the first two issues of Jay Lynch's Bijou Funnies. In 1969 Shelton and three friends from Texas founded Rip Off Press in San Francisco, which took over publication of all subsequent Freak Brothers comics. The first compilation of their adventures, The Collected Adventures of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, had its first printing in 1971 and has been continually in print ever since. In addition to underground and college weekly newspapers, new adventures appeared in magazines such as Playboy, High Times, and Rip Off Comix; these too were collected in comic book form. Shelton continued to write and draw the series until 1992, in collaboration with Dave Sheridan (1974‚Äì1982, his death) and Paul Mavrides (1978-1992). The majority of the comic books consist of one or more multi-page stories together with a number of one-page strips; many of the latter have a one-row skit featuring Fat Freddy's Cat at the bottom of the page. Issues #8-10 contained only the long- form story \\"The Idiots Abroad\\", which The Comics Journal listed as #44 of the \\"100 Greatest Comics of the Century.\\" The UK newspaper The Guardian said of a 2003 reprint of the story that, \\"The graphic quality is, even in slightly muddy reproduction, astonishing. Depictions of various European cities recall Herg√© in their accuracy and detail ... As for the subject matter, considering the dates of composition, it has hardly dated.\\"  Characters  The Freak Brothers are not siblings. They are a threesome of freaks (similar to, but distinct from, hippies) from San Francisco. The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, from left to right, Phineas, Fat Freddy, and Freewheelin' Franklin * Freewheelin' Franklin Freek, although laid-back, is the most street-smart of the trio. Apparently he has always been on the streets and it appears that he is several years older than the others. He is certainly old enough to be troubled at times by impotence. In one story he reveals that he grew up in an orphanage and never knew his parents. Tall and skinny, he has a big bulbous nose, a waterfall mustache and a ponytail. He wears cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. In one strip, he runs into an ex-girlfriend who has a child that bears a striking resemblance to him. He does his best to evade them and is relieved when she does not recognize him. In another strip, when he meets his own (possible) father, the same plot is inverted. Depending on the level of colorization used in the strip in question, Franklin's hair is red, blonde, or light brown. * Phineas T. Phreak is the intellectual and idealist of the group. He has enough mastery of chemistry to create new drugs and takes an avid interest in politics. Of the three, he is the most committed to social change and environmental issues. He is from Texas and while his mother is relaxed and open-minded, his father is a card-carrying member of the John Birch Society. He is the hairiest of the brothers‚Äîtall and skinny with a thick bush of black hair, a beard, a nose bearing more than a passing resemblance to a joint, and glasses. He is the stereotypical left-wing radical, bearing a superficial resemblance to Abbie Hoffman or Jerry Rubin. * Fat Freddy Freekowtski is the least intelligent of the trio and is most likely to be preoccupied with food. He is fat, with curly yellow hair and a mustache. His compulsion to eat is the subject of several of the adventures of the group. Fat Freddy frequently gets \\"burned\\" during drug transactions; when he does \\"score\\" he typically contrives to lose the drugs in various ways, such as by dumping them out of a shopping bag in front of a cooling fan, which then blows them out the window onto a police car. Fat Freddy comes from an unexceptional large family in Cleveland. In The Idiots Abroad, Freddy visits the Polish village of Gfatsk, where everybody happens to look like him. He is driven away by an angry mob as soon as they hear the name Freekowtski. Other recurring characters include: * Fat Freddy's Cat appears mainly in his own, separate strip at the bottom of the one-page Freak Brothers strips (getting his start just as Krazy Kat did). He also has several multi-page stories devoted to him. Many of his strips parallel a storyline in the corresponding Freak Brothers story, and often have themes of a scatological nature. He has several \\"nephews\\" who refer to him as \\"Uncle F.\\" and sometimes finds himself confronting an organized army of cockroaches or a huge tribe of mice who share the apartment with the Freak Brothers. He is far smarter than his owner (whom he frequently refers to as \\"the obese one\\") and regards the Freak Brothers with amused contempt. He is also the subject of several spin-off collections of stories. * Norbert the Nark, an inept DEA agent who is continually trying, and failing, to arrest the Freak Brothers. * Hiram \\"Country\\" Cowfreak, a hippy who grows vast quantities of marijuana at his isolated farmstead. He is referred to as the Freak Brothers' \\"cousin\\". * Dealer McDope, one of the trio's dealers. He is often mentioned in the strips but rarely appears in person. The character was initially created by Dave Sheridan for the Rip Off Press title Mother's Oats Comix. * Tricky Prickears, a blind, deaf and reactionary detective, sometimes billed as \\"The Freak Brothers' favorite law enforcement officer\\". The character is a parody of Dick Tracy, to the extent that Shelton drew his appearances in a different style, resembling that of Tracy's creator Chester Gould. * Governor Rodney Richpigge, a stereotypically rich, corrupt politician whom the Freak Brothers hold in general contempt. The Governor's son is a cocaine dealer.  Story-lines and themes  Fat Freddy, with his cat Drug use is the predominant theme that runs throughout all volumes of this title. The protagonists \\"live in a state of blissful torpor relieved only by bursts of paranoia or stimulant-induced frenzy.\\" Additional on December 19, 2016 Marijuana is the most frequently mentioned, but numerous other stimulants and hallucinogens are mentioned as well. Heroin is usually missing from the list. In one adventure, Franklin is shown to turn down an offer of \\"smack\\" when hitching a ride. Food is a recurring subject. These stories most often involve Fat Freddy and his marijuana-induced \\"munchies\\" (increased appetite). The squalor engendered by the Brothers' indolence is often highlighted; several strips feature the household's cockroach population, ruled over by a fascist monarchy. Several stories satirize governments, particularly the U.S. government. These stories invariably show politicians and their agents as corrupt, incompetent, or both. The theme of foreign travel is sometimes explored, most notably in the three-part Idiots Abroad series. It is common for the story-lines to begin with an air of realism, but rapidly descend into comic pantomime. Classic Freak Brothers stories include: * Grass Roots: The Brothers find a year's supply of cocaine and move to the country with the proceeds. They snort it all in two days. The Brothers are joined by a trio of hippie women who join them in their misadventures: the dilapidated farmhouse, Freddy's run in with a hillbilly drug dealer, the rumor of gold on the property, and Phineas running for sheriff.The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers #5 (Rip Off Press, May 1977). * Chariot of the Globs: Fat Freddy's Cat is abducted by aliens.The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers #4 (Rip Off Press, Nov. 1975). *The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers in the 21st Century: The Brothers experience life in the future. *Knock 'em Dead: The Brothers form a punk band. * The 7th Voyage of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers: A Mexican Odyssey: The Brothers holiday in Mexico, are thrown in jail and escape with the help of shaman Don Longjuan, in an oblique parody of the Carlos Castaneda books. * The Idiots Abroad: The Brothers are split up attempting to travel to Colombia hoping to score cheap dope down there, yet none of them manages to reach Bogot√°; Fat Freddy accidentally joins a group of nuclear terrorists in Scotland before disrupting the International Workers' Day military parade in Moscow, USSR and being subsequently sold to slavery in Africa; Franklin is almost killed by a native apocalyptic South American cult before joining a group of pirates; while Phineas ends up in Mecca and becomes the world's richest man after founding a new religion.Serialized in The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers issues #8‚Äì10 (Rip Off Press, 1984, 1985, and 1989).  Catchphrases  The Freak Brothers comics include several catchphrases: > Dope will get you through times of no money better than money will get you > through times of no dope. : ‚ÄîFreewheelin' Franklin. The Los Angeles Public > Library featured Anne Herbert's modification of the original quote written > by Gilbert Shelton: \\"Books will get you through times of no money better > than money will get you through times of no books\\"; this was used on a in- > library poster featuring the likeness of the Freewheelin' Franklin > character. > \\"Don't get burned!\\" (usually aimed at Fat Freddy as he sets out to purchase > drugs) > Smoking grass and drinking beer is like pissing into the wind. > While you're out there smashing the state, don't forget to keep a smile on > your lips and a song in your heart!  Other appearances  = In film = In 1973, without permission from Gilbert Shelton, The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers appeared in the full-length pornographic film Up in Flames. The story involved the brothers' attempts to raise cash to make their rent deadline (the trio being in danger of being evicted from their apartment). Fat Freddy gains employment at a local food store run by graphic artist Robert Crumb's character Mr. Natural (also used without permission). Director Paul Thomas Anderson said the look of Joaquin Phoenix's lead character, Larry \\"Doc\\" Sportello, in Anderson's 2014 adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel Inherent Vice, was based in part on characters in the comics. \\"[T]here's this documentary on Daniel Ellsberg, called The Most Dangerous Man in America. There's a great picture of a buddy of his who has this great set of glasses, a floppy hat and these mutton chops. I took a still frame from that and I sent it to [Phoenix], along with the omnibus collection of The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comic, by Gilbert Shelton‚Äîand that's probably the most we really talked about [Phoenix's portrayal of the character].\\" Still from Grass Roots. In 2006, the company Grass Roots Films began production on a feature-length clay-animation film based on the series, called Grass Roots, co-produced by German distribution company X Filme.A three-minute piece of test animation can be seen here.

Administratively, it is part of the Islands District.Lamma Island Romance Tour Name Lamma Island was named Lamma only because of a chart reading error by Alexander Dalrymple in the 1760s. He had acquired a Portuguese chart to the entrances to the Pearl River and, close to the west of the island, the Portuguese owner had written \\"Lama\\". Dalrymple misinterpreted that as the name of the island. However, it was a Portuguese notation as to the holding (consistency of the seabed from the point of view of anchoring there), which was (and is) mud ‚Äì in Portuguese \\"lama\\". In all the early charts the name was spelled with only one \\"m\\". So the island acquired a British name by error and one that subsequently was sinicised by its name being rendered phonetically in characters (\\"Lam a\\" can mean \\"south fork\\" in Cantonese), with the original muddle being all but forgotten. At some point, things became further obscured by the addition of the second \\"m\\" in the English spelling. In ancient times, Lamma used to be named as Pok Liu or Pok Liu Chau.Exploring Lamma ‚Äì History and Geographical Conditions Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry Geography Example of a naturally formed rock found near the summit of Mt. Stenhouse. Walking the trail between Sok Kwu Wan and Yung Shue Wan Lamma Island is located to the southwest of Hong Kong Island. It is the third largest island of Hong Kong, with an area of Survey and Mapping Office, Lands Department: Hong Kong geographic data sheet and a length of . The northern village is called Yung Shue Wan (Banyan Tree Bay) and the eastern village is called Sok Kwu Wan (Rainbow Bay). Few people live on the southern part of Lamma. Access for much of this part is by hiking or private boat. Beaches along Lamma's south-facing edge include Yung Shue Ha Beach and Sham Wan. Mount Stenhouse (, Shan Tei Tong) is the tallest mountain in Lamma above sea level, situated between Sok Kwu Wan and Sham Wan. Unusually shaped rocks can be found all over this mountain, but a grueling hike is necessary to access these. History According to archaeological findings, human settlement on the northern and eastern part of Lamma Island can be traced back to around 4000‚Äì3000 BC, the Middle Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Yung Shue Ha, one of Lamma's earliest villages, was settled in the early 19th century by a clan from China's Bao'an County. Demographics Yung Shue Wan. Lamma has an estimated population of 5,900 people as of 2014. However, with future developments such as a planned beach community in Sok Kwu Wan the population capacity is expected to double to 11,000 residents. Actor Chow Yun-fat () grew up on the island in the village of Wang Long near Yung Shue Wan. His relatives used to operate a seafood/pigeon restaurant called \\"Shau Kee\\" in the main village. Lamma has a significant Western and international population. The island has had a reputation for alternative lifestyles, hippies, and a relaxed attitude, but Lamma is being urbanised and property prices are increasing as a result of the attraction of this lifestyle. Description In contrast to Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, Lamma is peaceful and tranquil with an abundance of natural scenery. Buildings higher than three storeys are prohibited and there are no automobiles but diminutive fire trucks and ambulances, as well as village vehicles; distinctive open-back vehicles to transport construction materials. The community's only means of transport is either by foot or bicycle. Lamma provides an alternative to the hectic life in the city. Property and rents are cheap compared with those of central Hong Kong. These factors have attracted a significant expatriate community to Lamma Island. It is also popular with younger people and a haven for artists and musicians. Yung Shue Wan Hongkong Electric's Lamma Power Station Yung Shue Wan (Banyan Bay) is the most populated area on Lamma Island. Several decades ago, it was the centre of the plastics industry. The factories have now been replaced by seafood restaurants, pubs, grocery stores and shops which sell oriental and Indian-style handicraft. Hung Shing Yeh Beach, Lamma Power Station, North Lamma Island Public Library and Lamma Winds are also located in the northern part of the island. Sok Kwu Wan Overlooking the fish farms and restaurants at Sok Kwu Wan The big street of Sok Kwu Wan consists mainly of seafood restaurants. Sok Kwu Wan has the largest fish farming site in Hong Kong. Tourists can barbecue and fish at Lo Shing Beach which is a ten-minute walk from the village. The trail between Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan is surrounded by grassland and offers a picturesque walk. From there one can see a nice portion of the coastline of the island. It takes roughly an hour to walk the trail. Walkers may notice a few 'caves' on the trail near Sok Kwu Wan, labelled on tourist signs as 'kamikaze grottos'. These caves were dug out by the Japanese during the war, to store munitions alongside the suicide boats. When the British Navy reclaimed Hong Kong, they discovered rows of speedboats with explosive rigged to the bow in Sok Kwu Wan.Scenes in Hong Kong Following the Re-occupation of the Crown Colony after the Japanese Surrender. September 1945 Imperial War Museums In addition to the caves, the Japanese also dug tunnels into the island's peaks, including two known tunnels on Ling Kok ShanJapanese Tunnel, Ling Kok Shan No. 2 Gwulo and one on Mt. Stenhouse.Japanese Tunnel, Stenhouse Lamma Gwulo Sham Wan Sham Wan View of Mount Stenhouse Sham Wan is one of the five most important archaeological sites in Hong Kong. The bay is the site of an important Bronze Age settlement which was unearthed by archaeologists in the 1970s. It yielded evidence of people living on Lamma during the \\"Middle Neolithic\\" phase (c. 3800‚Äì3000 BC). Historically Sham Wan was also a place for green sea turtles to lay eggs. The endangered green turtles are a special group of marine organisms with distinctive navigation behaviour between their nesting, breeding, development and reproduction sites. As Sham Wan is the only existing nesting site for them in Hong Kong, every year there is a period of restricted access to it from 1 June to 31 October to allow the turtles to breed.Conservation of sea turtles in Hong Kong The breeding site is about . The last known nesting at Sham Wan was in 2012. Traditional festivals Tin Hau Temple in Yung Shue Wan. Tin Hau temples are typical places of worship in Hong Kong's coastal communities because Tin Hau is believed to be the goddess of the sea and of fishermen, protecting them and ensuring full nets. There are three Tin Hau temples on Lamma, located in Yung Shue Wan,Exploring Islands ‚Äì Tin Hau Temple, Yung Shue Wan Sok Kwu Wan,Exploring Islands ‚Äì Tin Hau Temple, Sok Kwu Wan and Luk Chau Village.Exploring Islands ‚Äì Luk Chau Tin Hau Temple The Tin Hau Festival (twenty-third of the third month of the Lunar Calendar) is widely celebrated by the fishermen's communities in Lamma. Cantonese opera and floral paper offerings known as Fa Pau at both Sok Kwu Wan and Yung Shue Wan are the highlights of the celebration. Lamma Island is also one of the few remaining places in Hong Kong where traditional Chinese New Year celebrations still take place: at the stroke of midnight, fireworks will be set off by the main families of the villages to frighten away the evil spirits, sending off a deafening thunder that can last up to 30 minutes. Transportation An aerial view of South Lamma There are regular ferry services to Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan from Central on Hong Kong Island, as well as to Yung Shue Wan via Pak Kok, and to Sok Kwu Wan via Mo Tat Wan, from Aberdeen. It takes about 25 minutes by ferry between Yung Shue Wan and Central. There are no cars on Lamma Island. Two ferries collided off Yung Shue Wan on 1 October 2012 at 8:20 pm local time. With 39 killed and 92 injured, the incident was the deadliest maritime disaster in Hong Kong since 1971. Sok Kwu Wan, Lamma Island As the island is not connected by road to the rest of Hong Kong, the only vehicles on the island are those used by the emergency services, and village vehicles, which are used to transport goods. The main method of getting around the island is on foot or by bicycle.  Notable people  * Chow Yun-fat, actor; born and raised on Lamma Island *John D.

It is one of the brightest nebulae, and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky. M42 is located at a distance of and is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth. The M42 nebula is estimated to be 24 light years across. It has a mass of about 2,000 times that of the Sun. Older texts frequently refer to the Orion Nebula as the Great Nebula in Orion or the Great Orion Nebula. The Orion Nebula is one of the most scrutinized and photographed objects in the night sky, and is among the most intensely studied celestial features.Press release, \\"Astronomers Spot The Great Orion Nebula's Successor \\", Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 2006. The nebula has revealed much about the process of how stars and planetary systems are formed from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. Astronomers have directly observed protoplanetary disks, brown dwarfs, intense and turbulent motions of the gas, and the photo-ionizing effects of massive nearby stars in the nebula.  Physical characteristics  Discussing the location of the Orion Nebula, what is seen within the star-formation region, and the effects of interstellar winds in shaping the nebula Amateur image of the Orion Nebula taken with a mid-range digital camera Orion and Running Man nebulae and nebulosity imaged in LRGB 384 mm refractor The constellation of Orion with the Orion Nebula (lower middle) The Nebula is visible with the naked eye even from areas affected by some light pollution. It is seen as the middle \\"star\\" in the \\"sword\\" of Orion, which are the three stars located south of Orion's Belt. The star appears fuzzy to sharp-eyed observers, and the nebulosity is obvious through binoculars or a small telescope. The peak surface brightness of the central region is about 17 Mag/arcsec2 (about 14 milli nits) and the outer bluish glow has a peak surface brightness of 21.3 Mag/arcsec2 (about 0.27 millinits).. The conversion to nits is based on 0 magnitude being 2.08 microlux. (In the photos shown here the brightness, or luminance, is enhanced by a large factor.) The Orion Nebula contains a very young open cluster, known as the Trapezium due to the asterism of its primary four stars. Two of these can be resolved into their component binary systems on nights with good seeing, giving a total of six stars. The stars of the Trapezium, along with many other stars, are still in their early years. The Trapezium is a component of the much larger Orion Nebula Cluster, an association of about 2,800 stars within a diameter of 20 light years. Two million years ago this cluster may have been the home of the runaway stars AE Aurigae, 53 Arietis, and Mu Columbae, which are currently moving away from the nebula at speeds greater than . = Coloration = Observers have long noted a distinctive greenish tint to the nebula, in addition to regions of red and of blue-violet. The red hue is a result of the HŒ± recombination line radiation at a wavelength of 656.3 nm. The blue-violet coloration is the reflected radiation from the massive O-class stars at the core of the nebula. The green hue was a puzzle for astronomers in the early part of the 20th century because none of the known spectral lines at that time could explain it. There was some speculation that the lines were caused by a new element, and the name nebulium was coined for this mysterious material. With better understanding of atomic physics, however, it was later determined that the green spectrum was caused by a low-probability electron transition in doubly ionized oxygen, a so-called \\"forbidden transition\\". This radiation was all but impossible to reproduce in the laboratory at the time, because it depended on the quiescent and nearly collision-free environment found in the high vacuum of deep space. History Messier's drawing of the Orion Nebula in his 1771 memoir, M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie Royale There has been speculation that the Mayans of Central America may have described the nebula within their \\"Three Hearthstones\\" creation myth; if so, the three would correspond to two stars at the base of Orion, Rigel and Saiph, and another, Alnitak at the tip of the \\"belt\\" of the imagined hunter, the vertices of a nearly perfect equilateral triangle with Orion's Sword (including the Orion Nebula) in the middle of the triangle seen as the smudge of smoke from copal incense in a modern myth, or, in (the translation it suggests of) an ancient one, the literal or figurative embers of a fiery creation. Neither Ptolemy's Almagest nor Al Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars noted this nebula, even though they both listed patches of nebulosity elsewhere in the night sky; nor did Galileo mention it, even though he also made telescopic observations surrounding it in 1610 and 1617. This has led to some speculation that a flare-up of the illuminating stars may have increased the brightness of the nebula. The first discovery of the diffuse nebulous nature of the Orion Nebula is generally credited to French astronomer Nicolas- Claude Fabri de Peiresc, on November 26, 1610 when he made a record of observing it with a refracting telescope purchased by his patron Guillaume du Vair. The first published observation of the nebula was by the Jesuit mathematician and astronomer Johann Baptist Cysat of Lucerne in his 1619 monograph on the comets (describing observations of the nebula that may date back to 1611). He made comparisons between it and a bright comet seen in 1618 and described how the nebula appeared through his telescope as: His description of the center stars as different from a comet's head in that they were a \\"rectangle\\" may have been an early description of the Trapezium Cluster. (The first detection of three of the four stars of this cluster is credited to Galileo Galilei in a February 4, 1617 although he did not notice the surrounding nebula ‚Äì possibly due to the narrow field of vision of his early telescope.Galileo Galilei: Siderius Nuncius, Venice, 1610. English Translation published at Bard College, Hudson NY\\" October 9, 2003 English Translation Original Latin version ) The nebula was independently \\"discovered\\" (though visible to the naked eye) by several other prominent astronomers in the following years, including by Giovanni Battista Hodierna (whose sketch was the first published in De systemate orbis cometici, deque admirandis coeli characteribus). Charles Messier observed the nebula on March 4, 1769, and he also noted three of the stars in Trapezium. Messier published the first edition of his catalog of deep sky objects in 1774 (completed in 1771). As the Orion Nebula was the 42nd object in his list, it became identified as M42. Henry Draper's 1880 photograph of the Orion Nebula, the first ever taken. One of Andrew Ainslie Common's 1883 photographs of the Orion Nebula, the first to show that a long exposure could record new stars and nebulae invisible to the human eye. In 1865 English amateur astronomer William Huggins used his visual spectroscopy method to examine the nebula showing it, like other nebulae he had examined, was made up of \\"luminous gas\\". On September 30, 1880 Henry Draper used the new dry plate photographic process with an 11-inch (28 cm) refracting telescope to make a 51-minute exposure of the Orion Nebula, the first instance of astrophotography of a nebula in history. Another set of photographs of the nebula in 1883 saw a breakthrough in astronomical photography when amateur astronomer Andrew Ainslie Common used the dry plate process to record several images in exposures up to 60 minutes with a 36-inch (91 cm) reflecting telescope that he constructed in the backyard of his home in Ealing, west London. These images for the first time showed stars and nebula detail too faint to be seen by the human eye. In 1902, Vogel and Eberhard discovered differing velocities within the nebula, and by 1914 astronomers at Marseilles had used the interferometer to detect rotation and irregular motions. Campbell and Moore confirmed these results using the spectrograph, demonstrating turbulence within the nebula. In 1931, Robert J. Trumpler noted that the fainter stars near the Trapezium formed a cluster, and he was the first to name them the Trapezium cluster. Based on their magnitudes and spectral types, he derived a distance estimate of 1,800 light years. This was three times farther than the commonly accepted distance estimate of the period but was much closer to the modern value. In 1993, the Hubble Space Telescope first observed the Orion Nebula. Since then, the nebula has been a frequent target for HST studies. The images have been used to build a detailed model of the nebula in three dimensions. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around most of the newly formed stars in the nebula, and the destructive effects of high levels of ultraviolet energy from the most massive stars have been studied.David F. Salisbury, 2001, \\"Latest investigations of Orion Nebula reduce odds of planet formation \\". In 2005, the Advanced Camera for Surveys instrument of the Hubble Space Telescope finished capturing the most detailed image of the nebula yet taken. The image was taken through 104 orbits of the telescope, capturing over 3,000 stars down to the 23rd magnitude, including infant brown dwarfs and possible brown dwarf binary stars. See also see the NASA press release. A year later, scientists working with the HST announced the first ever masses of a pair of eclipsing binary brown dwarfs, 2MASS J05352184‚Äì0546085. The pair are located in the Orion Nebula and have approximate masses of and respectively, with an orbital period of 9.8 days. Surprisingly, the more massive of the two also turned out to be the less luminous. Structure Optical images reveal clouds of gas and dust in the Orion Nebula; an infrared image (right) reveals the new stars shining within. The entirety of the Orion Nebula extends across a 1¬∞ region of the sky, and includes neutral clouds of gas and dust, associations of stars, ionized volumes of gas, and reflection nebulae. The Nebula is part of a much larger nebula that is known as the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. The Orion Molecular Cloud Complex extends throughout the constellation of Orion and includes Barnard's Loop, the Horsehead Nebula, M43, M78, and the Flame Nebula. Stars are forming throughout the entire Cloud Complex, but most of the young stars are concentrated in dense clusters like the one illuminating the Orion Nebula. VISTA reveals many young stars and other objects. The current astronomical model for the nebula consists of an ionized (H II) region, roughly centered on Theta1 Orionis C, which lies on the side of an elongated molecular cloud in a cavity formed by the massive young stars. (Theta1 Orionis C emits 3-4 times as much photoionizing light as the next brightest star, Theta2 Orionis A.) The H II region has a temperature ranging up to 10,000 K, but this temperature falls dramatically near the edge of the nebula. The nebulous emission comes primarily from photoionized gas on the back surface of the cavity. The H II region is surrounded by an irregular, concave bay of more neutral, high-density cloud, with clumps of neutral gas lying outside the bay area. This in turn lies on the perimeter of the Orion Molecular Cloud. The gas in the molecular cloud displays a range of velocities and turbulence, particularly around the core region. Relative movements are up to 10 km/s (22,000 mi/h), with local variations of up to 50 km/s and possibly more. Observers have given names to various features in the Orion Nebula. The dark lane that extends from the north toward the bright region is called the \\"Fish's Mouth\\". The illuminated regions to both sides are called the \\"Wings\\". Other features include \\"The Sword\\", \\"The Thrust\\", and \\"The Sail\\".\\"M-42\\", Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, April 12, 2006. Star formation View of several proplyds within the Orion Nebula taken by the Hubble Space Telescope Star Formation Fireworks in Orion The Orion Nebula is an example of a stellar nursery where new stars are being born. Observations of the nebula have revealed approximately 700 stars in various stages of formation within the nebula. In 1979 observations with the Lallemand electronic camera at the Pic-du-Midi Observatory showed six unresolved high- ionization sources near the Trapezium Cluster. These sources were interpreted as partly ionized globules (PIGs). The idea was that these objects are being ionized from the outside by M42. Later observations with the Very Large Array showed solar-system-sized condensations associated with these sources. Here the idea appeared that these objects might be low-mass stars surrounded by an evaporating protostellar accretion disk. In 1993 observations with the Hubble Space Telescope have yielded the major confirmation of protoplanetary disks within the Orion Nebula, which have been dubbed proplyds. HST has revealed more than 150 of these within the nebula, and they are considered to be systems in the earliest stages of solar system formation. The sheer numbers of them have been used as evidence that the formation of star systems is fairly common in the universe. Stars form when clumps of hydrogen and other gases in an H II region contract under their own gravity. As the gas collapses, the central clump grows stronger and the gas heats to extreme temperatures by converting gravitational potential energy to thermal energy. If the temperature gets high enough, nuclear fusion will ignite and form a protostar. The protostar is 'born' when it begins to emit enough radiative energy to balance out its gravity and halt gravitational collapse. Typically, a cloud of material remains a substantial distance from the star before the fusion reaction ignites. This remnant cloud is the protostar's protoplanetary disk, where planets may form. Recent infrared observations show that dust grains in these protoplanetary disks are growing, beginning on the path towards forming planetesimals. See also the press release Once the protostar enters into its main sequence phase, it is classified as a star. Even though most planetary disks can form planets, observations show that intense stellar radiation should have destroyed any proplyds that formed near the Trapezium group, if the group is as old as the low mass stars in the cluster. Since proplyds are found very close to the Trapezium group, it can be argued that those stars are much younger than the rest of the cluster members. =Stellar wind and effects= Once formed, the stars within the nebula emit a stream of charged particles known as a stellar wind. Massive stars and young stars have much stronger stellar winds than the Sun.Ker Than, January 11, 2006, \\"The Splendor of Orion: A Star Factory Unveiled\\", Space.com The wind forms shock waves or hydrodynamical instabilities when it encounters the gas in the nebula, which then shapes the gas clouds. The shock waves from stellar wind also play a large part in stellar formation by compacting the gas clouds, creating density inhomogeneities that lead to gravitational collapse of the cloud. View of the ripples (Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability) formed by the action of stellar winds on the cloud. There are three different kinds of shocks in the Orion Nebula. Many are featured in Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects:\\"Mapping Orion's Winds\\", January 16, 2006, Vanderbilt News Service * Bow shocks are stationary and are formed when two particle streams collide with each other. They are present near the hottest stars in the nebula where the stellar wind speed is estimated to be thousands of kilometers per second and in the outer parts of the nebula where the speeds are tens of kilometers per second. Bow shocks can also form at the front end of stellar jets when the jet hits interstellar particles. * Jet- driven shocks are formed from jets of material sprouting off newborn T Tauri stars. These narrow streams are traveling at hundreds of kilometers per second, and become shocks when they encounter relatively stationary gases. * Warped shocks appear bow-like to an observer. They are produced when a jet- driven shock encounters gas moving in a cross-current. * The interaction of the stellar wind with the surrounding cloud also forms \\"waves\\" which are believed to be due to the hydrodynamical Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.Denise Chow. Young stars blamed for space cloud ripples, NBC News The dynamic gas motions in M42 are complex, but are trending out through the opening in the bay and toward the Earth. The large neutral area behind the ionized region is currently contracting under its own gravity. There are also supersonic \\"bullets\\" of gas piercing the hydrogen clouds of the Orion Nebula. Each bullet is ten times the diameter of Pluto's orbit and tipped with iron atoms glowing in the infra-red. They were probably formed one thousand years earlier from an unknown violent event. Evolution Panoramic image of the center of the nebula, taken by the Hubble Telescope. This view is about 2.5 light years across. The Trapezium is at center left. Interstellar clouds like the Orion Nebula are found throughout galaxies such as the Milky Way. They begin as gravitationally bound blobs of cold, neutral hydrogen, intermixed with traces of other elements. The cloud can contain hundreds of thousands of solar masses and extend for hundreds of light years. The tiny force of gravity that could compel the cloud to collapse is counterbalanced by the very faint pressure of the gas in the cloud. Whether due to collisions with a spiral arm, or through the shock wave emitted from supernovae, the atoms are precipitated into heavier molecules and the result is a molecular cloud. This presages the formation of stars within the cloud, usually thought to be within a period of 10‚Äì30 million years, as regions pass the Jeans mass and the destabilized volumes collapse into disks. The disk concentrates at the core to form a star, which may be surrounded by a protoplanetary disk. This is the current stage of evolution of the nebula, with additional stars still forming from the collapsing molecular cloud. The youngest and brightest stars we now see in the Orion Nebula are thought to be less than 300,000 years old,\\"Detail of the Orion Nebula\\", HST image and text. and the brightest may be only 10,000 years in age. The Orion nebula imaged with a 4-inch refractor from Balangir, India. Some of these collapsing stars can be particularly massive, and can emit large quantities of ionizing ultraviolet radiation. An example of this is seen with the Trapezium cluster. Over time the ultraviolet light from the massive stars at the center of the nebula will push away the surrounding gas and dust in a process called photo evaporation. This process is responsible for creating the interior cavity of the nebula, allowing the stars at the core to be viewed from Earth. The largest of these stars have short life spans and will evolve to become supernovae. Within about 100,000 years, most of the gas and dust will be ejected. The remains will form a young open cluster, a cluster of bright, young stars surrounded by wispy filaments from the former cloud.Kroupa, P., Aarseth, S.J., Hurley, J. 2001, MNRAS, 321, 699, \\"The formation of a bound star cluster: from the Orion nebula cluster to the Pleiades\\" Image gallery Image: Orion the Hunter Watches Over ALMA.jpgOrion over ALMA.

It connects the Java Sea to the Indian Ocean. The name came from Sunda Kingdom, a kingdom ruling the west part of Java (now including West Java, Banten, and some west part of Central Java). It also comes from the name of the Sundanese people, the native people of West Java, with the Javanese people being found mostly in Central and East Java.\\"Sunda Islands\\". Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names. John Everett-Heath. Oxford University Press 2005. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. Geography The strait stretches in a roughly northeast/southwest orientation, with a minimum width of at its northeastern end between Cape Tua on Sumatra and Cape Pujat on Java. It is very deep at its western end, but as it narrows to the east it becomes much shallower, with a minimum depth of only 20 m (65 feet) in parts of the eastern end. It is notoriously difficult to navigate because of this shallowness, very strong tidal currents, sandbanks, and man-made obstructions such as oil platforms off the Java coast. It had been an important shipping route for centuries, especially during the period when the Dutch East India Company used it as the gateway to the Spice Islands of Indonesia (1602-1799). However, the strait's narrowness, shallowness, and lack of accurate charting make it unsuitable for many modern, large ships, most of which use the Strait of Malacca instead.Donald B. Freeman, The Straits of Malacca: Gateway Or Gauntlet?. McGill-Queen's Press, 2006. The strait is dotted by a number of islands, many of which are volcanic in origin. They include: Sangiang (Thwart-the-Way), Sebesi, Sebuku, and Panaitan (Prince's). The most famous volcano, however, is Krakatoa, which exploded in 1883 in one of the deadliest and most destructive eruptions in recorded history. The islands in the strait and the nearby surrounding regions of Java and Sumatra were devastated in that eruption, primarily due to intense pumice fall and huge tsunamis caused by the collapse of the volcano. The eruption drastically altered the topography of the strait, with as much as 18‚Äì21 km¬≥ of ignimbrite being deposited over an area of 1.1 million km¬≤ around the volcano. Some areas, such as the coastal region of Java now incorporated into the Ujung Kulon National Park, have never been resettled, but much of the coastline is now very densely populated. Aside from Krakatoa's sole remaining peak, Rakata, the Krakatoa Archipelago consists of the islands of Lang (Panjang or Rakata Kecil), Verlaten (Sertung), and most recently, Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the original Krakatoa's shattered remains. The Battle of Sunda Strait On March 1, 1942, the Battle of Sunda Strait‚Äîpart of the larger Battle of the Java Sea‚Äîtook place when the Allied cruisers HMAS Perth and USS Houston encountered a Japanese amphibious landing force near Bantam, commanded by Rear Admiral Kenzaburo Hara. That force included a light cruiser and eleven destroyers, four heavy cruisers and a light aircraft carrier. The two Allied cruisers were sunk, while a Japanese minesweeper and a transport vessel were sunk by friendly fire. Planned bridge In the 1960s proposals were made for a bridge across the Sunda Strait, and in the 1990s further suggestions arose. A new plan was announced in October 2007. It would use the islands of Ular, Sangiang and Prajurit to create a four-part suspension bridge reaching above sea level. This bridge would have a maximum span of 3 kilometers, nearly 50% longer than the current record holder, the Akashi Kaiky≈ç Bridge. Construction was projected to begin in 2014 if funding of at least US$10 billion could be secured. An accord was signed in April 2012 with China Railway Construction Corporation for an $11 billion road and double track rail bridge.Railway Gazette International June 2012 p25 However, in November 2014 the incoming government of President Joko Widodo shelved plans to build the bridge.Satria Sambijantoro, 'No more Sunda Strait Bridge plan', The Jakarta Post, 3 November 2014.

Founded in 1896, it is the United Kingdom's highest-circulated daily newspaper. Its sister paper The Mail on Sunday was launched in 1982, while Scottish and Irish editions of the daily paper were launched in 1947 and 2006 respectively. Content from the paper appears on the MailOnline website, although the website is managed separately and has its own editor. The paper is owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust. Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere, a great-grandson of one of the original co-founders, is the current chairman and controlling shareholder of the Daily Mail and General Trust, while day-to-day editorial decisions for the newspaper are usually made by a team led by the editor, Geordie Greig, who succeeded Paul Dacre in September 2018. A survey in 2014 found the average age of its readers was 58, and it had the lowest demographic for 15- to 44-year-olds among the major British dailies. Uniquely for a British daily newspaper, it has a majority female readership, with women making up 52‚Äì55% of its readers. It had an average daily circulation of 1,134,184 copies in February 2020. Between April 2019 and March 2020 it had an average daily readership of approximately 2.180 million, of whom approximately 1.407 million were in the ABC1 demographic and .773 million in the C2DE demographic. Its website has more than 218 million unique visitors per month. The Daily Mail has been noted for its unreliability and widely criticised for its printing of sensationalist and inaccurate scare stories of science and medical research, and for instances of plagiarism and copyright infringement. The Daily Mail has won a number of awards, including receiving the National Newspaper of the Year award from the The Press Awards eight times since 1995, winning again in 2019. Overview The Mail was originally a broadsheet but switched to a compact format on 3 May 1971, the 75th anniversary of its founding. On this date it also absorbed the Daily Sketch, which had been published as a Tabloid by the same company. The publisher of the Mail, the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Circulation figures according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations in February 2020 show gross daily sales of 1,134,184 for the Daily Mail. According to a December 2004 survey, 53% of Daily Mail readers voted for the Conservative Party, compared to 21% for Labour and 17% for the Liberal Democrats. The main concern of Viscount Rothermere, the current chairman and main shareholder, is that the circulation be maintained. He testified before a House of Lords select committee that \\"we need to allow editors the freedom to edit\\", and therefore the newspaper's editor was free to decide editorial policy, including its political allegiance. The Mail has been edited by Geordie Greig since September 2018, following the retirement of Paul Dacre who edited the paper since 1992.Steve Boggan \\"Media: Wind of change in Kensington: Will the Daily Mail still be rallying the Tory faithful?\\", The Independent, 15 July 1992Bill Hagerty \\"Paul Dacre: the zeal thing\\", British Journalism Review, Vol. 13, No. 3, 2002, pp. 11‚Äì22. Retrieved 25 May 2007. History =Early history= Advertisement by the Daily Mail for insurance against Zeppelin attacks during the First World War The Daily Mail, devised by Alfred Harmsworth (later Viscount Northcliffe) and his brother Harold (later Viscount Rothermere), was first published on 4 May 1896. It was an immediate success. It cost a halfpenny at a time when other London dailies cost one penny, and was more populist in tone and more concise in its coverage than its rivals. The planned issue was 100,000 copies but the print run on the first day was 397,215 and additional printing facilities had to be acquired to sustain a circulation which rose to 500,000 in 1899. Lord Salisbury, 19th- century Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, dismissed the Daily Mail as \\"a newspaper produced by office boys for office boys.\\" By 1902, at the end of the Boer Wars, the circulation was over a million, making it the largest in the world. With Harold running the business side of the operation and Alfred as editor, the Mail from the start adopted an imperialist political stance, taking a patriotic line in the Second Boer War, leading to claims that it was not reporting the issues of the day objectively.Gardiner, The Times, The Atlantic Monthly, January 1917 page 113 The Mail also set out to entertain its readers with human interest stories, serials, features and competitions. It was the first newspaper to recognize the potential market of the female reader with a women's interest section and hired one of the first female war correspondents Sarah Wilson who reported during the Second Boer War. In 1900 the Daily Mail began printing simultaneously in both Manchester and London, the first national newspaper to do so (in 1899, the Daily Mail had organised special trains to bring the London-printed papers north). The same production method was adopted in 1909 by the Daily Sketch, in 1927 by the Daily Express and eventually by virtually all the other national newspapers. Printing of the Scottish Daily Mail was switched from Edinburgh to the Deansgate plant in Manchester in 1968 and, for a while, The People was also printed on the Mail presses in Deansgate. In 1987, printing at Deansgate ended and the northern editions were thereafter printed at other Associated Newspapers plants. In 1906 the paper offered ¬£10,000 for the first flight from London to Manchester, followed by a ¬£1,000 prize for the first flight across the English Channel. Punch magazine thought the idea preposterous and offered ¬£10,000 for the first flight to Mars, but by 1910 both the Mails prizes had been won. The paper continued to award prizes for aviation sporadically until 1930. Before the outbreak of World War I, the paper was accused of warmongering when it reported that Germany was planning to crush the British Empire. When war began, Northcliffe's call for conscription was seen by some as controversial, although he was vindicated when conscription was introduced in 1916.New York Times Current History 1917, New York Times Company, 1917 p. 211 On 21 May 1915, Northcliffe criticised Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, regarding weapons and munitions. Kitchener was considered by some to be a national hero. The paper's circulation dropped from 1,386,000 to 238,000. Fifteen hundred members of the London Stock Exchange burned unsold copies and called for a boycott of the Harmsworth Press. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith accused the paper of being disloyal to the country. When Kitchener died, the Mail reported it as a great stroke of luck for the British Empire. The paper was critical of Asquith's conduct of the war, and he resigned on 5 December 1916. His successor David Lloyd George asked Northcliffe to be in his cabinet, hoping it would prevent him from criticising the government. Northcliffe declined. =Inter-war period= Before 1930 Bundles of newspapers loaded into the back of a 'Daily Mail' van in the early hours for delivery to newsagents As Lord Northcliffe aged, his grip on the paper slackened and there were periods when he was not involved. But light-hearted stunts enlivened him, such as the 'Hat campaign' in the winter of 1920. This was a contest with a prize of ¬£100 for a new design of hat ‚Äì a subject in which Northcliffe took a particular interest. There were 40,000 entries and the winner was a cross between a top hat and a bowler christened the Daily Mail Sandringham Hat. The paper subsequently promoted the wearing of it but without much success. In 1922, when Lord Northcliffe died, Lord Rothermere took full control of the paper. In 1919, Alcock and Brown made the first flight across the Atlantic, winning a prize of ¬£10,000 from the Daily Mail. In 1930 the Mail made a great story of another aviation stunt, awarding another prize of ¬£10,000 to Amy Johnson for making the first solo flight from England to Australia. The Daily Mail had begun the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1908. At first, Northcliffe had disdained this as a publicity stunt to sell advertising and he refused to attend. But his wife exerted pressure upon him and he changed his view, becoming more supportive. By 1922 the editorial side of the paper was fully engaged in promoting the benefits of modern appliances and technology to free its female readers from the drudgery of housework. The Mail maintained the event until selling it to Media 10 in 2009. On 25 October 1924, the Daily Mail published the forged Zinoviev letter, which indicated that British Communists were planning violent revolution. This was thought by some a significant factor in the defeat of Ramsay MacDonald's Labour Party in the 1924 general election, held four days later. Unlike most newspapers, the Mail quickly took up an interest on the new medium of radio. In 1928, the newspaper established an early example of an offshore radio station aboard a yacht, both as a means of self-promotion and as a way to break the BBC's monopoly. However, the project failed as the equipment was not able to provide a decent signal from overboard, and the transmitter was replaced by a set of speakers. The yacht spent the summer entertaining beach-goers with gramophone records interspersed with publicity for the newspaper and its insurance fund. The Mail was also a frequent sponsor on continental commercial radio stations targeted towards Britain throughout the 1920s and 1930s and periodically voiced support for the legalisation of private radio, something that would not happen until 1973. From 1923 Lord Rothermere and the Daily Mail formed an alliance with the other great press baron, Lord Beaverbrook. Their opponent was the Conservative Party politician and leader Stanley Baldwin. By 1929 George Ward Price was writing in the Mail that Baldwin should be deposed and Beaverbrook elected as leader. In early 1930 the two Lords launched the United Empire Party which the Daily Mail supported enthusiastically. The rise of the new party dominated the newspaper and, even though Beaverbrook soon withdrew, Rothermere continued to campaign. Vice Admiral Ernest Augustus Taylor fought the first by-election for the United Empire Party in October, defeating the official Conservative candidate by 941 votes. Baldwin's position was now in doubt, but in 1931 Duff Cooper won the key by-election at St George's, Westminster, beating the United Empire Party candidate, Sir Ernest Petter, supported by Rothermere, and this broke the political power of the press barons. In 1927, the celebrated picture of the year Morning by Dod Procter was bought by the Daily Mail for the Tate Gallery. Support of fascism Rothermere's article from the issue dated 15 January 1934. Lord Rothermere was a friend of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and directed the Mail's editorial stance towards them in the early 1930s. Rothermere's 1933 leader \\"Youth Triumphant\\" praised the new Nazi regime's accomplishments, and was subsequently used as propaganda by them. In it, Rothermere predicted that \\"The minor misdeeds of individual Nazis would be submerged by the immense benefits the new regime is already bestowing upon Germany\\". Journalist John Simpson, in a book on journalism, suggested that Rothermere was referring to the violence against Jews and Communists rather than the detention of political prisoners. Rothermere and the Mail were also editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists. Rothermere wrote an article titled \\"Hurrah for the Blackshirts\\" published in the Daily Mail on 15 January 1934, praising Mosley for his \\"sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine\\", and pointing out that: \\"Young men may join the British Union of Fascists by writing to the Headquarters, King's Road, Chelsea, London, S.W.\\" The Spectator condemned Rothermere's article commenting that, \\"... the Blackshirts, like the Daily Mail, appeal to people unaccustomed to thinking. The average Daily Mail reader is a potential Blackshirt ready made. When Lord Rothermere tells his clientele to go and join the Fascists some of them pretty certainly will.\\" The paper's support ended after violence at a BUF rally in Kensington Olympia in June 1934. Mosley and many others thought Rothermere had responded to pressure from Jewish businessmen who it was believed had threatened to stop advertising in the paper if it continued to back an anti-Semitic party. The paper editorially continued to oppose the arrival of Jewish refugees escaping Germany, describing their arrival as \\"a problem to which the Daily Mail has repeatedly pointed.\\" =Post-war history= Sub-editor's room at the offices of the Daily Mail newspaper in 1944 On 5 May 1946, the Daily Mail celebrated its Golden Jubilee. Winston Churchill was the chief guest at the banquet and toasted it with a speech. Newsprint rationing in the Second World War had forced the Daily Mail to cut its size to four pages, but the size gradually increased through the 1950s. The Daily Mail was transformed by its editor during the 1970s and 1980s, David English. He had been editor of the Daily Sketch from 1969 to 1971, when it closed. Part of the same group from 1953, the Sketch was absorbed by its sister title, and English became editor of the Mail, a post in which he remained for more than 20 years. English transformed it from a struggling newspaper selling half as many copies as its mid-market rival, the Daily Express, to a formidable publication, whose circulation rose to surpass that of the Express by the mid-1980s. English was knighted in 1982. The paper enjoyed a period of journalistic success in the 1980s, employing Fleet Street writers such as gossip columnist Nigel Dempster, Lynda Lee-Potter and sportswriter Ian Wooldridge (who unlike some of his colleagues ‚Äì the paper generally did not support sporting boycotts of white-minority-ruled South Africa ‚Äì strongly opposed apartheid). In 1982 a Sunday title, the Mail on Sunday, was launched (the Scottish Sunday Mail, now owned by the Mirror Group, was founded in 1919 by the first Lord Rothermere, but later sold).Griffiths Encyclopedia of the British Press, p. 545 Knighted in 1982, Sir David English became editor-in-chief and chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1992 after Rupert Murdoch had attempted to hire Evening Standard editor Paul Dacre as editor of The Times. The Evening Standard was then part of the Associated Newspapers group, and Dacre was appointed to succeed English at the Daily Mail as a means of dealing with Murdoch's offer. Dacre retired as editor of the Daily Mail but remains editor-in-chief of the group. In late 2013, the paper moved its London printing operation from the city's Docklands area to a new ¬£50 million plant in Thurrock, Essex. There are Scottish editions of both the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, with different articles and columnists. In August 2016, the Daily Mail began a partnership with The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. This partnership included publishing articles in the MailOnline produced by The People's Daily. The agreement appeared to observers to give the paper an edge in publishing news stories sourced out of China, but it also led to questions of censorship regarding politically sensitive topics. In November 2016, Lego ended a series of promotions in the paper which had run for years, following a campaign from the group 'Stop Funding Hate', who were unhappy with the Mail's coverage of migrant issues and the EU referendum. In September 2017, the Daily Mail partnered with Stage 29 Productions to launch DailyMailTV, an international news program produced by Stage 29 Productions in its studios based in New York City with satellite studios in London, Sydney, DC and Los Angeles. Dr. Phil McGraw (Stage 29 Productions) was named as executive producer. The program was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment News Program in 2018. In May 2020 the Daily Mail ended The Sun's 42-year reign as the United Kingdom's highest-circulation newspaper. The Daily Mail recorded average daily sales of 980,000 copies, with the Mail on Sunday recording weekly sales of 878,000. Scottish, Irish, Continental and Indian editions =Scottish Daily Mail= The Scottish Daily Mail header The Scottish Daily Mail was published as a separate title from Edinburgh starting in December 1946. The circulation was poor though, falling to below 100,000 and the operation was rebased to Manchester in December 1968. In 1995 the Scottish Daily Mail was relaunched, and is printed in Glasgow. It had an average circulation of 67,900 in the area of Scotland in December 2019. =Irish Daily Mail= The Daily Mail officially entered the Irish market with the launch of a local version of the paper on 6 February 2006; free copies of the paper were distributed on that day in some locations to publicise the launch. Its masthead differed from that of UK versions by having a green rectangle with the word \\"IRISH\\", instead of the Royal Arms, but this was later changed, with \\"Irish Daily Mail\\" displayed instead. The Irish version includes stories of Irish interest alongside content from the UK version. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the Irish edition had a circulation of 63,511 for July 2007, falling to an average of 49,090 for the second half of 2009. Since 24 September 2006 Ireland on Sunday, the Irish Sunday newspaper acquired by Associated in 2001, was replaced by an Irish edition of the Mail on Sunday (the Irish Mail on Sunday), to tie in with the weekday newspaper. =Continental and Overseas Daily Mail= Two foreign editions were begun in 1904 and 1905; the former titled the Overseas Daily Mail, covering the world, and the latter titled the Continental Daily Mail, covering Europe and North Africa. =Mail Today= The newspaper entered India on 16 November 2007 with the launch of Mail Today, a 48-page compact size newspaper printed in Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida with a print run of 110,000 copies. Based around a subscription model, the newspaper has the same fonts and feel as the Daily Mail and was set up with investment from Associated Newspapers and editorial assistance from the Daily Mail newsroom. Editorial stance The Mail has traditionally been a supporter of the Conservatives and has endorsed this party in all recent general elections. While the paper retained its support for the Conservative Party at the 2015 general election, the paper urged conservatively inclined voters to support UKIP in the constituencies of Heywood and Middleton, Dudley North and Great Grimsby where UKIP was the main challenger to the Labour Party. The paper is generally critical of the BBC, which it says is biased to the left.Douglas, Torin (18 June 2007). Does the BBC have a bias problem? . BBC News. The Mail has published pieces by Joanna Blythman opposing the growing of genetically modified crops in the United Kingdom. On international affairs, the Mail broke with the establishment media consensus over the 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia. The Mail accused the British government of dragging Britain into an unnecessary confrontation with Russia and of hypocrisy regarding its protests over Russian recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence, citing the British government's own recognition of Kosovo's independence from Russia's ally Serbia.

Hands in the Mail to describe activists in the movement for women's suffrage, in particular members of the WSPU.Crawford, Elizabeth (1999). The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866‚Äì1928. pg. 452. London: UCL Press. .Walsh, Ben. GCSE Modern World History second edition (Hodder Murray, 2008) p. 60.\\"Mr. Balfour and the 'Suffragettes.' Hecklers Disarmed by the Ex- Premier's Patience.\\" Daily Mail, 10 January 1906, p. 5.M But the women he intended to ridicule embraced the term, saying \\"suffraGETtes\\" (hardening the 'g'), implying not only that they wanted the vote, but that they intended to 'get' it.Colmore, Gertrude. Suffragette Sally. Broadview Press, 2007, p. 14 =Holes in the road= On 17 January 1967, the Mail published a story, \\"The holes in our roads\\", about potholes, giving the examples of Blackburn where it said there were 4,000 holes. This detail was then immortalised by John Lennon in The Beatles song \\"A Day in the Life\\", along with an account of the death of 21-year-old socialite Tara Browne in a car crash on 18 December 1966, which also appeared in the same issue. =Unification Church= In 1981, the Daily Mail ran an investigation into the Unification Church, nicknamed the Moonies, accusing them of ending marriages and brainwashing converts. The Unification Church, which always denied these claims, sued for libel but lost heavily. A jury awarded the Mail a then record-breaking ¬£750,000 libel payout. In 1983 the paper won a special British Press Award for a \\"relentless campaign against the malignant practices of the Unification Church.\\"\\"¬£750,000 in costs as Moonies lose marathon libel action\\", Glasgow Herald, 1 April 1981. p. 3 =Gay gene controversy= On 16 July 1993 the Mail ran the headline \\"Abortion hope after 'gay genes' finding\\". Of the tabloid headlines which commented on the Xq28 gene, the Mail's was criticised as \\"perhaps the most infamous and disturbing headline of all\\". =Stephen Lawrence= The Mail campaigned vigorously for justice over the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993. On 14 February 1997, the Mail front page pictured the five men accused of Lawrence's murder with the headline \\"MURDERERS\\", stating \\"if we are wrong, let them sue us\\".May, Margaret; Page, Robert M.; Brunsdon, Edward (2001). Understanding social problems: issues in social policy. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 272. This attracted praise from Paul Foot and Peter Preston. Some journalists contended the Mail had belatedly changed its stance on the Lawrence murder, with the newspaper's earlier focus being the alleged opportunistic behaviour of anti- racist groups (\\"How Race Militants Hijacked a Tragedy\\", 10 May 1993) and alleged insufficient coverage of the case (20 articles in three years). Two men who the Mail had featured in their \\"Murderers\\" headline were found guilty in 2012 of murdering Lawrence. After the verdict, Lawrence's parents and numerous political figures thanked the newspaper for taking the potential financial risk involved with the 1997 headline. =Stephen Gately= A 16 October 2009, a Jan Moir article criticised aspects of the life and death of Stephen Gately. It was published six days after his death and before his funeral. The Press Complaints Commission received over 25,000 complaints, a record number, regarding the timing and content of the article. It was criticised as insensitive, inaccurate and homophobic. The Press Complaints Commission did not uphold complaints about the article. Major advertisers, such as Marks & Spencer, had their adverts removed from the Mail Online webpage containing Moir's article. =Cannabis use= On 13 June 2011, a study by Dr Matt Jones and Michal Kucewicz on the effects of cannabinoid receptor activation in the brain was published in The Journal of Neuroscience and the British medical journal The Lancet. The study was used in articles by CBS News,Solved: Why pot smoking causes memory loss Wynne Parry 26 October 2011 Le Figaro,Comment le cannabis perturbe l'activit√© c√©r√©brale Aude Rambaud, 31 October 2011 and Bild among others. In October 2011, the Daily Mail printed an article citing the research, titled \\"Just ONE cannabis joint can bring on schizophrenia as well as damaging memory.\\" The group Cannabis Law Reform (CLEAR), which campaigns for ending drug prohibition, criticised the Daily Mail report. Dr Matt Jones, co-author of the study, said he was \\"disappointed but not surprised\\" by the article, and stated: \\"This study does NOT say that one spliff will bring on schizophrenia\\". Dorothy Bishop, professor of neuroscience at Oxford University, in her blog awarded the Daily Mail the \\"Orwellian Prize for Journalistic Misrepresentation\\", The Mail later changed the article's headline to: \\"Just ONE cannabis joint 'can cause psychiatric episodes similar to schizophrenia' as well as damaging memory.\\" =Ralph Miliband article= In September 2013, the Mail was criticised for an article on Ralph Miliband (father of then Labour-leader Ed Miliband and prominent Marxist sociologist), titled \\"The Man Who Hated Britain\\". Ed Miliband said that the article was \\"ludicrously untrue\\", that he was \\"appalled\\" and \\"not willing to see my father's good name be undermined in this way\\". Ralph Miliband had arrived in the UK from Belgium as a Jewish refugee from the Holocaust. The Jewish Chronicle described the article as \\"a revival of the 'Jews can't be trusted because of their divided loyalties' genre of antisemitism.\\" Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith linked the article to the Nazi sympathies of the 1st Viscount Rothermere, whose family remain the paper's owners. The paper defended the article's general content in an editorial, but described its use of a picture of Ralph Miliband's grave as an \\"error of judgement\\". In the editorial, the paper further remarked that \\"We do not maintain, like the jealous God of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons. But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different.\\" A spokesman for the paper also described claims that the article continued its history of anti-Semitism as \\"absolutely spurious.\\" However, the reference to \\"the jealous God of Deuteronomy\\" was criticised by Jonathan Freedland, who said that \\"In the context of a piece about a foreign-born Jew, [the remark] felt like a subtle, if not subterranean hint to the reader, a reminder of the ineradicable alienness of this biblically vengeful people\\" and that \\"those ready to acquit the Mail because there was no bald, outright statement of antisemitism were probably using the wrong measure.\\" =Gawker Media lawsuit= In March 2015, James King, a former contract worker at the Mail's New York office, wrote an article for Gawker titled 'My Year Ripping Off the Web With the Daily Mail Online. In the article, King alleged that the Mails approach was to rewrite stories from other news outlets with minimal credit in order to gain advertising clicks, and that staffers had published material they knew to be false. He also suggested that the paper preferred to delete stories from its website rather than publish corrections or admit mistakes. In September 2015, the Mail's US company Mail Media filed a $1 million lawsuit against King and Gawker Media for libel. Eric Wemple at the Washington Post questioned the value of the lawsuit, noting that \\"Whatever the merits of King's story, it didn't exactly upend conventional wisdom\\" about the website's strategy. In November 2016, Lawyers for Gawker filed a motion to resolve the lawsuit. Under the terms of the motion, Gawker was not required to pay any financial compensation, but agreed to add an Editor's Note at the beginning of the King article, remove an illustration in the post which incorporated the Daily Mail's logo, and publish a statement by DailyMail.com in the same story. =Anti-refugee cartoon= Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, a cartoon in the Daily Mail by Stanley McMurtry (\\"Mac\\") linked the European migrant crisis (with a focus on Syria in particular) to the terrorist attacks, and criticised the European Union immigration laws for allowing Islamist radicals to gain easy access into the United Kingdom. Despite being compared to Nazi propaganda by The New York Times, and criticised as \\"reckless xenophobia,\\" and racist, the cartoon received praise on the Mail Online website. A Daily Mail spokesperson told The Independent: \\"We are not going to dignify these absurd comments which wilfully misrepresent this cartoon apart from to say that we have not received a single complaint from any reader\\". =Anthony Weiner scandal= In September 2016, the Mail Online published a lengthy interview and screenshots from a 15-year- old girl who claimed that the American politician Anthony Weiner had sent her sexually explicit images and messages. The revelation led to Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin ‚Äì an aide of Hillary Clinton ‚Äì separating. Weiner pleaded guilty in May 2017 to sending obscene material to a minor, and in September he was jailed for 21 months. =Campaigns against plastic pollution= The paper has campaigned against plastic pollution in various forms since 2008. The paper called for a levy on single use plastic bags. The Daily Mail's work in highlighting the issue of plastic pollution was praised by the head of the United Nations Environment Program, Erik Solheim at a conference in Kenya in 2017. Emily Maitlis, the newscaster, asked Green Party leader Caroline Lucas on Newsnight, 'Is the biggest friend to the Environment at the moment the Daily Mail?' in reference to the paper's call for a ban on plastic microbeads and other plastic pollution, and suggested it had done more for the environment than the Green Party. Environment group ClientEarth has also highlighted the paper's role in drawing attention to the plastic pollution problem along with the Blue Planet II documentary. =Gary McKinnon deportation= Attempts by the United States government to extradite Gary McKinnon, a British computer hacker, were campaigned against by the paper. In 2002, McKinnon was accused of perpetrating the \\"biggest military computer hack of all time\\" although McKinnon himself states that he was merely looking for evidence of free energy suppression and a cover-up of UFO activity and other technologies potentially useful to the public. The Daily Mail began to support McKinnon's campaign in 2009 ‚Äì with a series of front-page stories protesting against his deportation. On 16 October 2012, after a series of legal proceedings in Britain, Home Secretary Theresa May withdrew her extradition order to the United States. Gary McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp praised the paper's contribution to saving her son from deportation in her book in which she said: 'Thanks to Theresa May, David Cameron and the support of David Burrowes and so many others ‚Äì notably the Daily Mail ‚Äì my son was safe, he was going to live.' = Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed = In December 2017 the Daily Mail published a front-page story entitled \\"Another human rights fiasco!\\", with the subheading \\"Iraqi 'caught red-handed with bomb' wins ¬£33,000 ‚Äì because our soldiers kept him in custody for too long\\". The story related to a judge's decision to award money to Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed after he had been unlawfully imprisoned. The headline was printed despite the fact that during the trial itself the judge concluded that claims that al-Waheed had been caught with a bomb were \\"pure fiction\\". In July 2018 the Independent Press Standards Organisation ordered the paper to publish a front-page correction after finding the newspaper had breached rules on accuracy in its reporting of the case. The Daily Mail reported that a major internal investigation was conducted following the decision to publish the story, and as a result, \\"strongly worded disciplinary notes were sent to seven senior members of staff\\", which made it clear \\"that if errors of the same nature were to happen again, their careers would be at risk\\".

K. Rowling received substantial damages and the Mail printed an apology. The newspaper had made a false claim about Rowling's story written for the website of Gingerbread, a single parents' charity. * 2017, April: First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump, received an undisclosed settlement over claims in the Mail that she had worked as an escort in the 1990s. In September 2016, she began litigation against the Daily Mail for an article which discussed escort allegations. The article included rebuttals and said that there was no evidence to support the allegations. The Mail regretted any misinterpretation that could have come from reading the article, and retracted it from its website. Melania Trump filed a lawsuit in Maryland, suing for $150 million. On 7 February 2017, the lawsuit was re-filed in the correct jurisdiction, New York, where the Daily Mails parent company has offices, seeking damages of at least $150 million. =Unsuccessful lawsuits= * 1981, April: The Daily Mail won ¬£750,000 from the Unification Church, which had sued for libel due to articles about the Church's recruitment methods. Margaret Singer, professor of Psychiatry at the University of California, Berkeley, testified that the Mails accounts of these methods were accurate. The trial lasted over five months, one of Britain's longest-ever civil trials. * 2012, February: Nathaniel Philip Rothschild lost his libel case against the Daily Mail, after the High Court agreed that he was indeed the \\"Puppet Master\\" for Peter Mandelson, that his conduct had been \\"inappropriate in a number of respects\\" and that the words used by the Daily Mail were \\"substantially true\\". * 2012, May: Carina Trimingham, the partner of former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne, was ordered to pay more than ¬£400,000 after she lost her High Court claims for damages for alleged breach of privacy and harassment against the Daily Mail. Huhne, whilst married, had an affair with Trimingham ‚Äì who herself was in a lesbian civil partnership ‚Äì and then later left his wife Vicky Pryce for Trimingham. This and a series of other events involving Pryce and Huhne led to his resignation from the Cabinet, and to both of them being arrested for perverting the course of justice and the criminal prosecution R v Huhne and Pryce. Criticism =Racism accusations= There have been accusations of racism against the Daily Mail. In 2012, in an article for The New Yorker, former Mail reporter Brendan Montague criticised the Mail's content and culture, stating: \\"None of the front-line reporters I worked with were racist, but there's institutional racism [at the Daily Mail]\\". In August 2020 a group of Palm Islanders in Queensland, Australia, lodged a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 against the Daily Mail and 9News, alleging that they had broadcast and published reports that were inaccurate and racist about the Indigenous Australian recipients of compensation after the Palm Island Class Action. =Homophobia accusations= After High Court judges ruled in 2016 that parliamentary approval must be sought for activation of Article 50, the leading headline on the Mail's front page read \\"Enemies of the People\\". The paper's front page and other coverage drew much criticism from the legal world, as well as from high-ranking politicians. On its website, the Mail described one of the judges as \\"openly gay.\\" Critics accused the Mail of unnecessarily highlighting the judge's sexual orientation due to anti-gay motives. The Mail later removed the description. One law professor commented: \\"I have never seen this kind of invective against judges, either here or abroad, in the national media.\\" =Sexism accusations= In 2014, after Emma Watson spoke at the launch of the United Nations HeForShe campaign, the Mail was criticised for focusing its coverage on Watson's dress and appearance, rather than the content of her speech, in which Watson complained how media had sexualised her in their coverage from when she was 14. The Mail was much criticised for running the front-page headline \\"Never mind Brexit, who won legs-it\\", accompanying a photograph of Theresa May meeting with Nicola Sturgeon in March 2017, running more than a page of coverage on the two leaders' appearance. Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Labour Party, tweeted \\"It's 2017. This sexism must be consigned to history. Shame on the Daily Mail.\\" The International Business Times quoted an unnamed Daily Mail staff member describing the headline as \\"moronic\\", and out of touch with the Daily Mail's largely female readership. =Paying for footage under investigation= In 2015, following the November 2015 Paris attacks, the French police viewed the footage of the attacks from the CCTV system of La Casa Nostra. After making a copy on a USB flash drive, the police ordered a technician from the CCTV company that installed the system to encrypt the footage, saying ‚Äòthis now falls under the confidentiality of the investigation, it must remain here‚Äô. Freelance journalist Djaffer Ait Aoudia told The Guardian that he secretly filmed a Daily Mail representative negotiating with the owner to sell the CCTV footage of the attacks. The caf√© owner agreed to supply the footage for ‚Ç¨50,000 and asked an IT technician to make the footage accessible again. The Daily Mail responded: \\"There is nothing controversial about the Mail's acquisition of this video, a copy of which the police already had in their possession.\\" The Guardian also, briefly, embedded the footage on their own website before removing it. =Byline removal= In 2017 evoke.ie, the Daily Mail's showbiz site, was reported to the internship program of Dublin City University after the bylines of hundreds of articles written by students were changed. =Sensationalism= The Daily Mail is said to have an \\"ongoing project to divide all the inanimate objects in the world into ones that either cause or prevent cancer\\". It has also been criticised for their extent of coverage of celebrities, the children of celebrities, property prices, and the depiction of asylum seekers, the latter of which was discussed in the Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights in 2007. =Reliability= The Daily Mail's medical and science journalism has been criticised by some doctors and scientists, accusing it of using minor studies to generate scare stories or being misleading. In 2011, the Daily Mail published an article titled \\"Just ONE cannabis joint 'can cause psychiatric episodes similar to schizophrenia' as well as damaging memory\\". Dr. Matt Jones, the lead author of the study that is cited in the article was quoted by Cannabis Law Reform as saying: \\"This study does NOT say that one spliff will bring on schizophrenia\\". Carbon Brief complained to the Press Complaints Commission about an article published in the Daily Mail titled \\"Hidden green tax in fuel bills: How a ¬£200 stealth charge is slipped on to your gas and electricity bills\\" because the ¬£200 figure was unexplained, unreferenced and, according to Ofgem, incorrect. The Daily Mail quietly removed the article from their website. In 2013, the Met Office criticised an article about climate change in the Daily Mail by James Delingpole for containing \\"a series of factual inaccuracies\\". The Daily Mail in response published a letter from the Met Office chairman on its letters page, as well as offering to append the letter to Delingpole's article. In February 2017, the Daily Mail became the first source to be deprecated as an \\"unreliable source\\" to use as a reference on the English Wikipedia. Its use as a reference is now \\"generally prohibited, especially when other more reliable sources exist\\". Support for the ban centred on \\"the Daily Mail's reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication\\". Though the Daily Mail strongly contested this decision by the community, Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales backed the community's choice, stating: \\"I think what [the Daily Mail has] done brilliantly in this ad funded world (is) they've mastered the art of click bait, they've mastered the art of hyped up headlines, they've also mastered the art of, I'm sad to say, of running stories that simply aren't true. And that's why Wikipedia decided not to accept them as a source anymore. It's very problematic, they get very upset when we say this, but it's just fact.\\" An editorial in The Times commenting on the ban stated that \\"Newspapers make errors and have the responsibility to correct them. Wikipedia editors' fastidiousness, however, appears to reflect less a concern for accuracy than dislike of the Daily Mail's opinions.\\" In August 2018, the Mail Online deleted a lengthy news article titled \\"Powder Keg Paris\\" by journalist Andrew Malone which focused on \\"illegal migrants\\" living in the Paris suburb of Saint Denis, after a string of apparent inaccuracies were highlighted on social media by French activist Marwan Muhammad, including mistaking Saint-Denis, the city, for Seine-Saint-Denis, the department northeast of Paris. Local councillor Majid Messaoudene said that the article had set out to \\"stigmatise\\" and \\"harm\\" the area and its people. The journalist, Andrew Malone, subsequently deleted his Twitter account. In 2019, the IPSO ruled against the Daily Mail and confirmed in its ruling that the article was inaccurate. In early 2019, the mobile version of the Microsoft Edge Internet browser started warning visitors to the MailOnline site, via its NewsGuard plugin, that \\"this website generally fails to maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability\\" and \\"has been forced to pay damages in numerous high-profile cases\\". In late January 2019, the status of the MailOnline was changed by the Newsguard Plugin from Red to Green, updating its verdict to \\"this website generally maintains basic standards of accuracy and accountability\\". An Editors Note from Newsguard stated that \\"This label now has the benefit of the dailymail.co.uk's input and our view is that in some important respects their objections are right and we were wrong\\".

(by Knight Features) * Up and Running (by Knight Features) * Fred Basset Up and Running is a strip distributed by Knight Features and Fred Basset has followed the life of the dog of the same name in a two-part strip in the Daily Mail since 8 July 1963. The long-running Teddy Tail cartoon strip, was first published on 5 April 1915 and was the first cartoon strip in a British newspaper.Rickards, Maurice; Twyman, Michael (2000). The encyclopaedia of ephemera: a guide to the fragmentary documents of everyday life for the collector, curator, and historian. Routledge. p. 103. It ran for over 40 years to 1960, spawning the Teddy Tail League Children's Club and many annuals from 1934 to 1942 and again from 1949 to 1962. Teddy Tail was a mouse, with friends Kitty Puss (a cat), Douglas Duck and Dr. Beetle. Teddy Tail is always shown with a knot in his tail. =Year Book= The Daily Mail Year Book first appeared in 1901, summarizing the news of the past year in one volume of 200 to 400 pages. Among its editors were Percy L. Parker (1901‚Äì1905), David Williamson (1914‚Äì1951), G. B. Newman (1955‚Äì1977), Mary Jenkins (1978‚Äì1986), P.J. Failes (1987), and Michael and Caroline Fluskey (1991). =Online media= The majority of content appearing in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday printed newspapers also forms part of that included in the MailOnline website. MailOnline is free to read and funded by advertising. In 2011 MailOnline was the second most visited English-language newspaper website worldwide. It has since then become the most visited newspaper website in the world, with over 189.5 million visitors per month, and 11.7 million visitors daily, as of January 2014.Newspaper ABCs: Digital statistics for January 2014 20 February 2014 Thailand's military junta blocked the MailOnline in May 2014 after the site revealed a video of Thailand's Crown Prince and his wife, Princess Srirasmi, partying. The video appears to show the allegedly topless princess, a former waitress, in a tiny G-string as she feeds her pet dog cake to celebrate its birthday. The Daily Mail in literature The Daily Mail has appeared in a number of novels. These include Evelyn Waugh's 1938 novel Scoop which was based on Waugh's experiences as a writer for the Daily Mail. In the book the newspaper is renamed The Daily Beast.Katharine Bail Hoskins, Today the Struggle: Literature and Politics in England during the Spanish Civil War (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2014) p. 32 The newspaper was also the subject of a parody song by the Irish Volunteers during the Tan War, and popularized by the band \\"The Irish Brigade\\" in 2004. In the song, they were mocked as being sensationalist of nationalist activities (lyric: and the IRA just sent me a time bomb in the mail, and I'm shaking in my shoes as I'm typing out the news), as well as being portrayed as out-of-touch and delusional (lyric: every hen is laying hand grenades). The newspaper appeared in Nicci French's 2008 novel The Memory Game, a psychological thriller.Nicci French, The Memory Game (London: Penguin Books, 2008) In 2015, it featured in Laurence Simpson's comic novel about the tabloid media, According to The Daily Mail.Laurence Simpson, According to The Daily Mail (London: Matador, 2015) And in 2017, a thinly-disguised version of the Daily Mail, called simply The Mail appears in Michael Paraskos's dark satire based on the Donald Trump presidency, Rabbitman, in which the newspaper's fictional editor is subjected to a lobotomy in a dystopian post-Brexit Britain to try and cure him of \\"nasty little paranoid thoughts about scroungers, traitors and foreigners.\\"Michael Paraskos, Rabbitman (London: Friction Fiction, 2017) p.62 Editors Source:D.

It is said that the Northumberland site, quite close to Alnwick, was chosen for some slight resemblance to Mount Carmel where the order originated. Substantial ruins survive, watched over by the stone figures of friars carved in the 18th century. It is a sign of the unrest felt in this area so near to the border with Scotland that the priory had a surrounding wall and in the 15th century a pele tower was erected. Changes were made at the Dissolution of the Monasteries when the Percy family took control. The priory is situated in Hulne Park, a walled park covering several thousand acres which belongs to the Duke of Northumberland and is close to Alnwick Castle. Originally a hunting park, and still used by the Duke for shooting, it now contains woods, moors, stretches of open grassland and Alnwick's home farm. Apart from the priory, the buildings in the park include the gatehouse of the former Alnwick Abbey, and Brizlee Tower, which is a viewing tower in Gothic Revival style that dates from the 1780s. The public is admitted to Hulne Park, but it is not marketed as a visitor attraction and has no visitor facilities. Entry is via the approach from Alnwick, and is restricted to pedestrians only. The ruins of the priory may be viewed whilst Brizlee Tower is rarely open to the public. Hulne Priory was a filming location in HTV's Robin of Sherwood with Michael Praed where it doubled for Kirklees Abbey. Later it was Maid Marian's home in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. The priory is licensed for wedding ceremonies and is occasionally used as a location for live performances.

Thompson first gained prominence in the late 1960s as the lead guitarist and songwriter for the folk rock group Fairport Convention, which he had co-founded in 1967. After departing the group in 1971, Thompson released his debut solo album Henry the Human Fly in 1972. The next year, he formed a duo with his then-wife Linda Thompson, which produced six albums, including the critically acclaimed I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight (1974) and Shoot Out the Lights (1982). After the dissolution of the duo, Thompson revived his solo career with the release of Hand of Kindness in 1983. He has released a total of eighteen solo studio albums. Three of his albums ‚Äì Rumor and Sigh (1991), You? Me? Us? (1996), and Dream Attic (2010) ‚Äì have been nominated for Grammy Awards, while Still (2015) was his first UK Top Ten album. He continues to write and record new material regularly and frequently performs live at venues throughout the world. Music critic Neil McCormick described Thompson as \\"a versatile virtuoso guitarist and a sharp observational singer-songwriter whose work burns with intelligence and dark emotion\\". His songwriting has earned him an Ivor Novello Award and, in 2006, a lifetime achievement award from BBC Radio. His 1991 song \\"1952 Vincent Black Lightning\\" was included in Time magazine's \\"All Time 100 Songs\\" list of the best English-language musical compositions released between 1923 and 2011.\\"All-TIME 100 Songs: 1952 Vincent Black Lightning\\" (retrieved on 26 February 2014). Thompson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to music. Many varied musicians have recorded Thompson's compositions. Early life and career (1949 to 1972) Richard Thompson was born in Ladbroke Crescent, Notting Hill, West London, England. His father, a Scot, was a Scotland Yard detective, and an amateur guitar player; several other family members had played music professionally. While attending William Ellis School in Highgate, he formed his first band, Emil and the Detectives (named after a book and a movie by the same title) with classmate Hugh Cornwell, later lead singer and guitarist of The Stranglers, on bass guitar. Like so many musicians of his generation, Thompson was exposed to and embraced rock and roll music at an early age, and he was also exposed to his father's jazz and traditional Scottish music record collection. His father had seen Django Reinhardt play in Glasgow in the 1930s and played guitar himself. He was later described by his son as \\"a bad amateur player ... with three chords, though, unfortunately, not C, F and G.\\" All these musical genres were to colour Thompson's playing in the years to come. Joe Boyd said: By the age of 18 Thompson was playing with the newly formed Fairport Convention. Thompson's guitar playing caught the ear of American producer Joe Boyd. Largely on the strength of Thompson's playing, Boyd took them under his wing and signed them to his Witchseason production and management company. Boyd said: Shortly thereafter Thompson, already acquiring a reputation as an outstanding guitar player, started writing songs seriously. This seems to have been out of necessity as Fairport Convention was essentially a cover band at first. By early 1969, when Fairport's second album What We Did on Our Holidays was recorded and released, Thompson was starting to emerge as a songwriter of distinction. As Fairport's lineup and their sound evolved, Thompson continued to grow in stature as a player and as a songwriter with compositions like \\"Meet on the Ledge\\". On 12 May 1969, between the recording and release of their next album Unhalfbricking, Fairport's van crashed on the M1 motorway on the way home from a gig at Mothers, a club in Birmingham. Drummer Martin Lamble, aged 19, and Thompson's girlfriend Jeannie Franklyn were killed. The rest of the band suffered injuries of varying severity. Later in 1969, Fairport re-grouped with a new drummer, Dave Mattacks, and also invited the well known fiddle player, Dave Swarbrick, to join. Thompson and Swarbrick worked together to create songs such as \\"Crazy Man Michael\\" from the band's seminal 1969 folk-rock album Liege & Lief and \\"Sloth\\" from its 1970 follow-up Full House. In January 1971 Thompson announced that he was leaving Fairport Convention. His decision seems to have been instinctive, rather than a calculated career move: In April 1972 he released his first solo album Henry the Human Fly, recording with Sandy Denny, Pat Donaldson, Sue Draheim, John Kirkpatrick, Barry Dransfield, Ashley Hutchings, Linda Peters, Andy Roberts, and others. The album sold poorly and was panned by the press, especially the influential Melody Maker magazine. With time Henry has come to be more highly regarded, but at the time the critics' response hurt both Thompson and his career. 1970s: Richard and Linda Thompson By the 1970s, Thompson had begun a relationship with the singer Linda Peters, who had sung on Henry the Human Fly. In October 1972 the couple were married, and Thompson, with Linda now effectively his front woman, regrouped for his next album and the next phase of his career. The first Richard and Linda Thompson album, I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight, was recorded in May 1973 in short time and on a small budget. Largely because of the petrol shortage in Britain and its impact on the availability of vinyl for records, Bright Lights was held back by Island Records for nearly a year before being released in April 1974. The album was well received by critics, though sales were less than stellar. Thompson's lyrics expressed a rather dismal world view, and it has been suggested that the bleak subject matter of his songs helped to keep his recordings off the hit parade. A more likely explanation was given by ex-Island A&R; man Richard Williams in the 2003 BBC TV documentary Solitary Life: Thompson was just not interested in fame and its trappings. The Thompsons recorded two more albums‚ÄîHokey Pokey and Pour Down Like Silver, both released in 1975‚Äîbefore Richard Thompson decided to leave the music business. The couple moved to a Sufi community in East Anglia. It was not apparent from their records at first, but the Thompsons had embraced an esoteric Sufi strand of Islam in early 1974. I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight was recorded before this conversion, but released some time afterwards. The songs for the second Richard and Linda album, Hokey Pokey, were similarly written some time ahead of the album's recording and eventual release. It was Pour Down Like Silver, with its cover photo of a turbaned Richard Thompson, that tipped the public off to the Thompsons' growing preoccupation with their faith. The trilogy of albums released before and after his sojourn in the commune was heavily influenced by Thompson's beliefs and by Sufi scripture, but in the long run his religious beliefs have not influenced his work in an obvious manner. The outlook expressed in his songs, his musical style, the subjects addressed by his lyrics have not shown any fundamental change. He remains a committed Muslim. Thompson started to re- engage with the world of professional music in 1977. He played on an album by Sandy Denny, and had undertaken a short tour and started recording with a group of musicians who were also Sufis. Thompson asked Joe Boyd to produce these sessions, and two days were spent on the initial recordings. Boyd recalls that the sessions were not a success: \\"It was really, I felt, very poor. I didn't have much confidence in the musicians that he was working with. The atmosphere was very strange and it just didn't seem to work.\\" At about this time the Thompsons and their family moved out of the commune and back to their old home in Hampstead. Boyd had already invited Richard Thompson to play on Julie Covington's debut album. With spare studio time and the American session musicians hired to work on the Covington album available, the Thompsons went back into the studio to record under their own name for the first time in three years. The resulting album, First Light, was warmly received by critics but did not sell particularly well. Neither did its follow up, 1979's harder-edged and more cynical Sunnyvista. Chrysalis Records did not take up their option to renew the contract, and the Thompsons found themselves without one. 1980s Leeds Folk Festival, 1982 Gerry Rafferty had booked the Thompsons as the support act for his 1980 tour, and had also used Richard as a session player on his Night Owl album. Rafferty offered to finance the recording of a new Richard and Linda Thompson album which he would then use to secure a contract for the Thompsons. Richard Thompson fell out with Rafferty during this project and was not happy with the finished product. Nevertheless, Rafferty kept his side of the bargain and presented the album to several record companies ‚Äì none of which expressed interest in signing the Thompsons. Rafferty did not recover his investment. About a year later Joe Boyd signed the Thompsons to his small Hannibal label and a new album was recorded. Shoot Out the Lights included new recordings of many of the songs recorded in 1980. Linda Thompson was pregnant at the time of the recording, so the album's release was delayed until they could tour behind the album. Breathing problems arising from her pregnancy also meant that Linda could not sing the lead part on some of these songs as she had done on demo tapes and the Rafferty-produced recordings. As an interim measure, Richard Thompson agreed to a short (5-day), low-key solo tour of the U.S. This tour was set up by Nancy Covey, then concert director for McCabe's Guitar Shop in Santa Monica. Covey, who had been in the UK in 1981 trying to sign Thompson to play at McCabe's, arranged for Thompson well-received 5 and 6 December shows. It was during this tour that Thompson and Covey developed an intimate relationship, and during that month, Richard and Linda Thompson separated. Upon its release in 1982, Shoot Out the Lights was lauded by critics and sold quite well ‚Äì especially in the U.S. The Thompsons, now a couple for professional purposes only, toured the United States in support of the album, their only American tour together. Both the album and their live shows were well received by the American media, and Shoot Out the Lights effectively relaunched their career ‚Äì just as their marriage was falling apart. The performances, with a backing band including both Simon Nicol and Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention, were seen as strong, but the tension between Richard and Linda was all too obvious. For this reason, the Thompsons' fans often refer to the Shoot Out the Lights tour as \\"The Tour from Hell\\". Upon returning home, Richard and Linda went their separate ways. Richard Thompson continued recording as a solo artist. His 1983 album Hand of Kindness saw him working with Boyd again, but with a revised backing band and a more extroverted and up-tempo song selection. With his separation from Linda finalized, Richard Thompson began to commute between twin bases in London and Los Angeles and to tour regularly in the USA. Encouraged by the success of his solo shows in late 1981 and early 1982, he began to perform solo with increasing frequency and continued to tour with a band. In 1983 and 1984 he toured the US and Europe with the Richard Thompson Big Band, which included two saxophone players in addition to the more usual rhythm section, second guitar and accordion. Set lists included covers of classic rock 'n roll songs and jazz standards such as \\"Tuxedo Junction\\". In 1985 Thompson signed with PolyGram and received a sizeable advance. He and Nancy Covey married at an alcohol-free wedding that included a who's who of roots-music performers who Covey knew well from McCabe's and the Los Angeles music scene, and had introduced to Thompson. After their wedding, Thompson moved his home and working base to California. As part of the settlement that allowed Thompson to leave Boyd's Hannibal label for Polygram, the live album Small Town Romance was released. This comprised recordings made during Thompson's solo shows in the US in late 1981 and early 1982. 1985's Across a Crowded Room was his last album to be recorded in England and the last to have Boyd as producer. Thompson put together a new look backing band for the tour to promote this album, and some shows were filmed for a live video release (see Richard Thompson discography). In 1986 he released Daring Adventures, which was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Mitchell Froom. Daring Adventures, with a rich sound, markedly different production and use of American session players, was perceived by some as evidence of Thompson's increasing \\"Americanisation\\". Perhaps more significantly, the album continued the trend, begun with Across A Crowded Room, of Thompson's songs moving away from the seemingly personal material and towards the character sketches and narratives for which he has since become famous. Froom and PolyGram had plans to target college and the growing \\"alternative\\" markets with Daring Adventures. Sales improved, but not substantially. Polygram declined an option to renew the contract. Thompson's management negotiated a new deal with Capitol Records. In 1985 Fairport Convention reformed and recorded the album Gladys' Leap. Thompson did not rejoin Fairport, but he did contribute a song to the project and played guitar on another track on the album. 1988 saw the release of Thompson's first album for Capitol, Amnesia. Froom was retained as producer, and once again the album was recorded in Los Angeles with many of the same players that Froom had called upon for the Daring Adventures sessions. 1990s Thompson contributed music to BBC Northwest's documentary Hard Cash and appears on the eponymous accompanying album issued by Topic. A track from the album, Time To Ring Some Changes is included in the 2009 Topic Records 70-year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten as track thirteen on the sixth CD. Thompson appears on Willie Nile's 1991 Places I Have Never Been album. In 1991 Thompson recorded Rumor and Sigh, his second album for Capitol. Once again Froom produced. This album, particularly the acoustic guitar ballad \\"1952 Vincent Black Lightning,\\" was hailed by critics and fans alike and greatly advanced Thompson's reputation as a leading traditional-style guitarist. Rumor and Sigh was nominated for a Grammy and sold well. However, a shake-up at Capitol saw Hale Milgrim (Thompson's champion and fan within the boardroom) replaced by Garry Gersh. Thus, Thompson's next album Mirror Blue was held back for almost a year before being released. Thompson was awarded the Orville H. Gibson Award for best acoustic guitar player in 1997. In 1992 he performed with David Byrne. Their joint acoustic concert at St. Ann & The Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights, New York on 24 March, produced the album An Acoustic Evening, which was released the same year. Mirror Blue was released in 1994, to often negative reviews sparked by the production decisions that Thompson and Froom took. Thompson took to the road to promote the album. He was joined by drummer Dave Mattacks, Danny Thompson (no relation) on double bass, and Pete Zorn on acoustic guitar, backing vocals, mandolin and various wind instruments. This line-up toured with Thompson the following two years. Thompson continued recording for Capitol until 1999, when Mock Tudor was recorded and released. His deal with Capitol was modified so that he could release and directly market limited-quantity, live recorded, not-for-retail albums. The first of these was Live at Crawley, released in 1995. 2000s Thompson at the Cambridge Folk Festival, 2006 In 2001 Thompson declined the option to renew his contract with Capitol. Thompson appeared on his ex-wife Linda's studio album Fashionably Late on the song \\"Dear Mary\\". It was the first time the two had recorded together since Shoot Out the Lights. In 2003 the BBC produced a documentary about Thompson's long musical career, entitled Solitary Life, directed by Paul Bernays and narrated by John Peel. It featured interviews with Thompson from his home in California and contributions from Billy Connolly, Bonnie Raitt, ex-wife Linda Thompson, Harry Shearer and Thompson's then wife Nancy Covey. The programme was re-broadcast by BBC Four in September 2012. The move away from big labels and big budgets paradoxically brought a bigger marketing push and healthier sales. Thompson's first two self-funded releases, 2003's The Old Kit Bag and 2005's Front Parlour Ballads, did well in the indie charts on both sides of the Atlantic. In May 2007 Thompson released Sweet Warrior. The album was licensed to different labels in different territories: Shout! Factory in the US, P-Vine in Japan, Planet Records in Australia, and Proper Records in the UK and Europe. In August of the same year Island released a live Richard and Linda Thompson album, compiled from recordings made during the November 1975 tour to promote the Pour Down Like Silver album. Thompson continued releasing \\"official bootlegs\\" on his boutique label as an additional source of revenue ‚Äì all live recordings. 2010s In early 2010 Thompson assembled a band and did a string of shows showcasing new material. The aim was to record the new material in a live setting. The recording and touring band consisted of Thompson, Pete Zorn, (acoustic guitar, flute, saxophone, mandolin, vocals); Michael Jerome (drums, vocals), Taras Prodaniuk, (bass guitar, vocals); and Joel Zifkin, (electric violin, mandolin, vocals). The resulting album Dream Attic, released in August the same year, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. On 10 June 2010 Thompson was awarded the Mojo Les Paul Award for \\"Guitar Legend\\". Thompson curated the 2010 Meltdown Festival. The festival included a tribute to the recently deceased Kate McGarrigle, a feature of which was a rare on-stage reunion of Richard and Linda Thompson. Thompson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to music. On 5 July 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen. In early 2013 Thompson released Electric, recorded in Nashville with Buddy Miller producing. The record enjoyed good reviews and debuted in the UK top 20. Thompson took to the road with a stripped down \\"power trio\\" band on a multi-month tour on both sides of the Atlantic to promote the new album. Also in 2013, Thompson appeared on his ex-wife Linda's fourth studio album Won't Be Long Now, on the track \\"Love's for Babies and Fools\\" . It was the second time the two have recorded together since Shoot Out the Lights. In 2014, Thompson released Acoustic Classics, an album featuring acoustic renditions of 14 songs from his back catalogue, on his Beeswing label. The record reached number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. Thompson appears alongside family members, both blood related and by marriage, on the album Family (2014) by Thompson (the band being named for all the Thompsons that appear), performing two songs solo and contributing to others as well. The album was produced by son Teddy Thompson and features ex-wife Linda Thompson, The Rails who are Thompson's daughter Kami Thompson and her husband James Walbourne, as well as other related musicians, including Walbourne's brother and Richard Thompson's son from his second marriage. The Richard Thompson Electric Trio (with Michael Jerome and Taras Prodaniuk) at Towersey Festival, 2018 Thompson released Still in June 2015, an album produced by Jeff Tweedy of Wilco and recorded in Tweedy's The Loft Studio. The album reached number 10 in the UK Album chart, his first album to reach the UK top 10. In September 2015 he appeared on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland, where he performed \\"All Buttoned Up\\" and \\"\\"She Never Could Resist a Winding Road\\" from his album Still. This was followed, in 2017, by a second acoustic album Acoustic Classics II which reached number 24 on the UK Albums Chart. and Acoustic Rarities, an album of new recordings of some of the more obscure songs in the Thompson catalogue, some previously existing only as cover versions. Thompson's eighteenth studio album, 13 Rivers was released on 14 September 2018. Thompson produced the record himself at Boulevard Recording in Los Angeles. On 30 September 2019 Thompson played at the Royal Albert Hall to celebrate his 70th birthday. Side projects and collaborations In between leaving Fairport Convention in early 1971 and releasing his debut solo album in 1972 he undertook a large amount of session work, most notably on albums by John Martyn, Al Stewart, Matthews Southern Comfort, Sandy Denny, Mike Heron and Nick Drake. During the same period he also worked on two collaborative projects. Morris On was recorded with Ashley Hutchings, John Kirkpatrick, Dave Mattacks and Barry Dransfield, and was a collection of English traditional tunes arranged for electric instruments. The Bunch were almost the reverse conceptually ‚Äì a grouping of English folk rock musicians (including Sandy Denny, Linda Peters and members of Fairport Convention) recording a selection of classic rock and roll tunes. Thompson has continued to guest on albums by an array of artists, from Crowded House, Bonnie Raitt and Vivian Stanshall, to Norma Waterson and BeauSoleil and folk artists like Loudon Wainwright III, Cathal McConnell (of The Boys of the Lough) and Bob Davenport. He has also performed and recorded with Teddy Thompson, his son from his marriage to Linda Thompson. Thompson with Fairport Convention's Dave Pegg at Cropredy, 2005 Since the early 1980s Thompson has appeared at Fairport Convention's annual Cropredy Festival, both in his own right and as a participant in sets with current and previous Fairport members. These sets are seldom confined to performances of songs out of the Thompson or Fairport Convention canons, and in recent years some surprise offerings have included the soul classic \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" (with Thompson backed by the Roy Wood Big Band), The Beatles' \\"I'm Down\\" and even \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\". Thompson has displayed a penchant for the avant garde as well, working with former Pere Ubu singer David Thomas's grouping The Pedestrians on two albums in 1981 and 1982, respectively. In the 1980s, he was associated with a loose-fitting group called The Golden Palominos, who were led by drummer Anton Fier and included at times on stage and on record Jack Bruce, Michael Stipe, Carla Bley, John Lydon, Bill Laswell and others. He has worked with experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser, most notably as part of the ad hoc grouping French Frith Kaiser Thompson with whom he recorded two albums. In 1997 he worked with long-time friend and band member Danny Thompson to record a concept album Industry that dealt with the decline of British industry. A year later he worked with early music expert Philip Pickett on the acclaimed Bones of All Men which fused renaissance tunes with contemporary music. For several years Thompson devised and toured his show 1000 Years of Popular Music. The inspiration for this came when Playboy asked Thompson (and many other music industry figures) in 1999 for their suggestions for the \\"top ten songs of the millennium\\". Guessing that Playboy expected most people's lists to start at around 1950, Thompson took the magazine at its word and presented a list of songs from the 11th century to the present day. Perhaps not surprisingly, Playboy did not use his list, but the exercise gave him the idea for a show which takes a chronological trip through popular music across the ages. Thompson acknowledges that this is an ambitious undertaking, partly because he reckons that he is technically unqualified to sing 98% of the material,Liner notes to 1000 Years Of Popular Music CD . Retrieved 20 March 2008 and partly because of the sparse musical setting he restricts himself to: besides his acoustic guitar, he's backed by singer/pianist Judith Owen and percussionist/singer Debra Dobkin. A typical performance would start with a medieval round, progress via a Purcell aria, Victorian music hall and Hoagy Carmichael and end with Thompson's take on the Britney Spears hit \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\". In 2004 Thompson was asked to create the soundtrack music for the Werner Herzog documentary Grizzly Man. The score, which was recorded over a two-day period in December 2004, brought Thompson together with a group of improvisational musicians, mostly from the San Francisco Bay area; video footage from the sessions was edited into a mini-documentary, In the Edges, which was included with the DVD release of Grizzly Man. In 2009 Thompson was commissioned to write a piece for the International Society of Bassists in honour of Danny Thompson. The resulting Cabaret of Souls, a musical play set in the underworld, has been performed in State College (Pennsylvania), London, and Los Angeles with a cast that includes Harry Shearer, Judith Owen, Debra Dobkin, Pete Zorn, either Danny Thompson or David Piltch, and a 12-piece string section conducted by Peter Askim. This suite was eventually commercially released in late 2012. In 2006 and 2013, Thompson recorded Hugh S. Roberton's \\"Mingulay Boat Song\\" and the traditional \\"General Taylor\\" for the sea shanty-compilations Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys and Son of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs & Chanteys. In July 2019 New West Records released a soundtrack album for the documentary The Cold Blue, featuring the film's original score composed by Thompson. The film, directed by Erik Nelson, tells the story of the Eighth Air Force which flew multiple deadly missions during World War II and features newly restored 4K footage and outtakes, shot by director William Wyler, during the summer of 1943 for his 1944 documentary Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress. Retrospectives and tributes There are a number of retrospective collections of Thompson's work, many containing material which is unavailable elsewhere. 1976's (guitar, vocal) was a collection of unreleased material from the previous eight years of Thompson's appearances on the Island label. The 3-CD set Watching the Dark combines his better-known songs and previously unreleased live and studio tracks. Action Packed is a compilation of tracks from his Capitol releases, plus three hard-to-find songs. Finally, in 2006, the independent label Free Reed released RT- The Life and Music of Richard Thompson, a 5-CD box set consisting almost entirely of previously unreleased performances of songs from throughout Thompson's long career. Thompson's songs have been extensively covered; for example, Dimming of the Day has been performed by artists such as The Neville Brothers, Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris, David Gilmour, The Blind Boys of Alabama, June Tabor, The Corrs and Alison Krauss and Union Station. There have been several tribute compilations of other artists' interpretations of his work, including: Capitol's Beat the Retreat: Songs by Richard Thompson and Green Linnet's The World Is a Wonderful Place: The Songs of Richard Thompson, both released in 1994. Playing style Thompson makes use of the \\"pick and fingers\\" technique (sometimes referred to as \\"hybrid picking\\") where he plays bass notes and rhythm with a pick between his first finger and thumb, and adds melody and punctuation by plucking the treble strings with his fingers. He also makes use of different guitar tunings, such as (low to high) CGDGBE, DADGBE, DADGAD, and more. This enables him to adapt traditional songs, as on Strict Tempo! and 1000 Years of Popular Music. Thompson occasionally makes use of a thumb-pick, playing in fingerstyle, the most notable example being on the motorcycle ballad \\"1952 Vincent Black Lightning.\\" Guitars =Electric= Thompson is often associated with the Fender Stratocaster guitar. He has made prominent use of Stratocasters, as he has a general preference for the sound of single coil pick-ups. Prior to using a Stratocaster with Fairport Convention he used a Gibson Les Paul with P-90 pick-ups. he then switched to a late 60s Stratocaster. Since leaving Fairport Convention he has continued to use electric guitars with single coil pick-ups, most famously a late-1950s Stratocaster but also two custom built electrics by Danny Ferrington as well as other Stratocasters, various Telecaster-type guitars and, in the studio, a Danelectro U2. As regards effects, he has made significant use of modulation and vibrato type effects pedals, most notably the Univibe and emulations thereof. Thompson has made intermittent use of Roland's GK-1 pick-up and GL-2 synthesiser over the years. He made use of these devices on 1979's Sunnyvista album and has occasionally used them in concert. =Acoustic= Since the early 1990s Thompson has made prominent use of Lowden acoustic guitars for studio and live work; Lowden have made a signature model for him. Before this he used a Martin 000-18 as well as instruments built by Danny Ferrington. For live work his acoustic guitars are fitted with a Sunrise pick-up and an internal condenser microphone. The output from the pick-up is usually fed into some effects pedals, typically a delay pedal and a Uni-Vibe.Gear and Tuninqs Q&A; . Retrieved 26 April 2007.

She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Romsey in Hampshire from 2000 to 2010, when she lost her seat to Conservative candidate Caroline Nokes. Biography Born Sandra Julia Rawson in Rosset, Denbighshire in Wales, she was educated at the Eggar's Grammar School in Alton, Hampshire; the Afcent International School in Brunssum, Netherlands; and the Windsor Girls' School in Hamm, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. She finished her education at the Bath Polytechnic where she was awarded a BPharm Diploma in 1978. She became a MRPharmS in 1979. In 1979 she joined Badham Chemists as a pharmacist in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, until she was appointed as a pharmacy manager with GK Chemists in Gloucester in 1980. She became a locum pharmacist in 1982 before joining Safeway as a supermarket pharmacy manager in 1992, and joined Tesco in the same position in 1999 where she remained until her election to the House of Commons. On 17 July 2019, Gidley was announced as the first female President of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Parliamentary career She joined the Liberal Democrats in 1994, was elected as a councillor to the Test Valley Borough Council in 1995 and was, in 1997, the youngest ever female mayor of Romsey. After Romsey's Conservative MP Michael Colvin died in a fire at his home in Tangley on 24 February 2000, Gidley was selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the resulting by-election. She won the by-election, on 4 May, with a majority of 3,311 votes and won in the 2001 and 2005 general elections. However, in 2005 her majority was reduced to only 125 votes, the smallest of any Lib Dem MP, by the Conservative candidate, Caroline Nokes. She was appointed as the party's spokeswoman on women's issues and older people from 2001. In January 2006, as Kennedy faced allegations of a drink problem, Gidley was one of 11 members of the front-bench team to write to Kennedy asking him to resign. Gidley chaired her party's Gender Balance Task Force, an initiative to get more women into politics. The Romsey constituency was abolished for the 2010 election, and in the new Romsey and Southampton North constituency she was defeated by the Conservative candidate Caroline Nokes, who took the new seat a majority of 4,165 votes following the expenses scandal, in which it emerged Gidley accepted a ¬£18,700 'windfall' from her London landlord in return for an increase in her taxpayer funded rent. Criticism of parliamentary expenses Gidley was sometimes described as \\"Hampshire's most expensive MP\\" by her political opponents, claiming ¬£160,000 in 2007/08, and ¬£187,000 in another year, midst concerns she was using tax payer's money to fund her political and re-election campaign. It emerged the Tax Payer was paying money to her party's constituency office, including paying the business rates, ¬£60 for water, over ¬£600 a year on telephones, and ¬£960 on tea, coffee and cleaning. In 2011, her successor, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, claimed ¬£87,000 a year less in expenses than Gidley. However in 2017‚Äì2018 Caroline Nokes was claiming ¬£168,297.18 in expenses. Whilst an MP, Gidley was claiming ¬£1,638 a month for a luxury flat with indoor swimming pool in London, as well as ¬£420 a month for food, and over ¬£1,000 for Council Tax, and was criticised when it emerged she and three other Lib Dem MPs, accepted a ¬£18,700 cash windfall from the landlord of the Dolphin Square flat, in return for agreeing to an increase in their rent, which was funded by the taxpayer. She was found to have \\"accepted one-off cash payment from the owners of an apartment block close to Parliament in return for agreeing to pay higher rent levels\\". A Parliamentary Committee on Standards and Privileges was critical of Gidley's 'serious misjudgment' in accepting the windfall, said she had broke the rules, and she was forced to apologise for it. Return to politics Gidley stood unsuccessfully in the 2013 Hampshire County Council election against incumbent Conservative Councillor Roy Perry, former Member of the European Parliament and also the father of Caroline Nokes, the Conservative candidate who defeated her in 2010.http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10397363.UKIP_make_gains_in_Hampshire_County_Council_elections_live_coverage/= In the 2019 Local Elections, Gidley returned to Test Valley Council as the Councillor for Romsey Abbey ward defeating the Conservative Party incumbent. Lord Rennard Gidley was her Party's Front Bench Spokesperson on Women's issues, and Chair of the Lib Dems 'Gender Balance Taskforce' at the time it emerged the Party's Chief Executive, Lord Rennard, was accused of a series of sexual assaults against women. She appeared on the BBC and admitted that the Lib Dems had 'screwed up'. However, several days later she claimed she had informed party leader Nick Clegg of the concerns over Rennard's conduct. Neither Nick Clegg or Sandra Gidley knew of any specific details as stated by Nick Clegg's spokesman \\"Sandra Gidley once raised general concerns with Nick Clegg about Lord Rennard's conduct. She did not know of or raise specific allegations.\\". Personal life Gidley and her husband Bill, an electronics engineer, married in 1979 and have lived in Romsey since 1986. They have a daughter, Gemma, and a son, Nick, who both attended local state schools. Gidley was for many years a voluntary antenatal teacher with the National Childbirth Trust and has been involved with many charitable organisations. She enjoys badminton, and lists reading, cookery and the theatre amongst her hobbies, and is a supporter of Macmillan Cancer Relief.

The museum features material related to anthropology, archaeology, botany, geology, zoology, art, and cultural history. History The University Museum of Bergen was founded in 1825 by Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie, at the time president of the Storting. Founded under the name University Museum of Bergen with the intent of building large collections in the fields of culture and natural history, it became the grounds for most of the academic activity in the city, a tradition which has prevailed since the museum became part of the University of Bergen. The University Museum of Bergen is divided into two departments, the Natural History Collections and the Cultural History Collections and Public Outreach and exhibitions. It is also the caretaker of the museum garden, formerly the botanical garden, surrounding the natural history building, and the city's arboretum. This was the first dedicated museum building in Norway. In its early years, the museum contained numerous art collections, including several works by the painter Johan Christian Dahl, cultural artefacts, and craftwork items. In 1931, the museum moved from its location in the Seminarium Fredericianum building near Bergen Cathedral School (Bergen katedralskole), to a new building southwest of Lille Lungeg√•rdsvannet. The current natural history building was designed by Johan Henrik Nebelong and finished in 1865. Bergen Museum moved in during 1866. The wings of the building were added in 1898 and the botanical garden was laid out between 1897 and 1899. The cultural history department got its own building in 1927. The increasing research activity at the museum from the late 19th century and onward led directly to the founding of the University of Bergen in 1946.

Neighbourhoods are often social communities with considerable face-to- face interaction among members. Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition, but the following may serve as a starting point: \\"Neighbourhood is generally defined spatially as a specific geographic area and functionally as a set of social networks. Neighbourhoods, then, are the spatial units in which face-to-face social interactions occur‚Äîthe personal settings and situations where residents seek to realise common values, socialise youth, and maintain effective social control.\\"Schuck, Amie and Dennis Rosenbuam 2006 \\"Promoting Safe and Healthy Neighborhoods: What Research Tells Us about Intervention.\\" The Aspen Institute. Preindustrial cities In the words of the urban scholar Lewis Mumford, ‚ÄúNeighbourhoods, in some annoying, inchoate fashion exist wherever human beings congregate, in permanent family dwellings; and many of the functions of the city tend to be distributed naturally‚Äîthat is, without any theoretical preoccupation or political direction‚Äîinto neighbourhoods.‚ÄùMumford, Lewis (1954). The Neighborhood and the Neighborhood Unit. Town Planning Review 24:256‚Äì270, p. 258. Most of the earliest cities around the world as excavated by archaeologists have evidence for the presence of social neighbourhoods.For example, Spence, Michael W. (1992) Tlailotlacan, a Zapotec Enclave in Teotihuacan. In Art, Ideology, and the City of Teotihuacan, edited by Janet C. Berlo, pp. 59‚Äì88. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, D.C. Stone, Elizabeth C. (1987) Nippur Neighbourhoods. Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization vol. 44. Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago Historical documents shed light on neighbourhood life in numerous historical preindustrial or nonwestern cities.Some examples: Heng, Chye Kiang (1999) Cities of Aristocrats and Bureaucrats: The Development of Medieval Chinese Cityscapes. University of Hawai'i Press, Honolulu. Marcus, Abraham (1989) The Middle East on the Eve of Modernity: Aleppo in the Eighteenth Century. Columbia University Press, New York. Smail, Daniel Lord (2000). Imaginary Cartographies: Possession and Identity in Late Medieval Marseille. Cornell University Press, Ithaca. Neighbourhoods are typically generated by social interaction among people living near one another. In this sense they are local social units larger than households not directly under the control of city or state officials. In some preindustrial urban traditions, basic municipal functions such as protection, social regulation of births and marriages, cleaning and upkeep are handled informally by neighbourhoods and not by urban governments; this pattern is well documented for historical Islamic cities.Abu-Lughod, Janet L. (1987) The Islamic City: Historic Myth, Islamic Essence, and Contemporary Relevance. International Journal of Middle East Studies 19:155‚Äì176. In addition to social neighbourhoods, most ancient and historical cities also had administrative districts used by officials for taxation, record-keeping, and social control.Dickinson, Robert E. (1961) The West European City: A Geographical Interpretation. Routledge & Paul, London, p. 529. See also: Jacobs, Jane (1961) The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Random House, New York, p. 117. Administrative districts are typically larger than neighbourhoods and their boundaries may cut across neighbourhood divisions. In some cases, however, administrative districts coincided with neighbourhoods, leading to a high level of regulation of social life by officials. For example, in the T‚Äôang period Chinese capital city Chang‚Äôan, neighbourhoods were districts and there were state officials who carefully controlled life and activity at the neighbourhood level.Xiong, Victor Cunrui (2000) Sui-Tang Chang'an: A Study in the Urban History of Medieval China. Center for Chinese Studies, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Neighbourhoods in preindustrial cities often had some degree of social specialisation or differentiation. Ethnic neighbourhoods were important in many past cities and remain common in cities today. Economic specialists, including craft producers, merchants, and others, could be concentrated in neighbourhoods, and in societies with religious pluralism neighbourhoods were often specialised by religion. One factor contributing to neighbourhood distinctiveness and social cohesion in past cities was the role of rural to urban migration. This was a continual process in preindustrial cities, and migrants tended to move in with relatives and acquaintances from their rural past.Kemper, Robert V.

Washington, DC: Author. at nhi.org As a unit in urban design In the 1900s, Clarence Perry described the idea of a neighbourhood unit as a self-contained residential area within a city. The concept is still influential in New Urbanism. Practitioners seek to revive traditional sociability in planned suburban housing based on a set of principles. At the same time, the neighbourhood is a site of interventions to create Age-Friendly Cities and Communities (AFCC) as many older adults tend to have narrower life space. Urban design studies thus use neighbourhood as a unit of analysis. Neighbourhoods around the world =Asia= A suburban street in Amman, Jordan. China In mainland China, the term is generally used for the urban administrative division found immediately below the district level, although an intermediate, subdistrict level exists in some cities. They are also called streets (administrative terminology may vary from city to city). Neighbourhoods encompass 2,000 to 10,000 families. Within neighbourhoods, families are grouped into smaller residential units or quarters of 100 to 600 families and supervised by a residents' committee; these are subdivided into residents' small groups of fifteen to forty families. In most urban areas of China, neighbourhood', community, residential community, residential unit, residential quarter' have the same meaning: or or or , and is the direct sublevel of a subdistrict (), which is the direct sublevel of a district (), which is the direct sublevel of a city (). (See Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China) =Europe= Typical Cypriot neighbourhood in Aglandjia, Nicosia, Cyprus Vuores, a neighbourhood in the city of Tampere, Finland United Kingdom The term has no general official or statistical purpose in the United Kingdom, but is often used by local boroughs for self-chosen sub-divisions of their area for the delivery of various services and functions, as for example in Kingston- upon-Thames or is used as an informal term to refer to a small area within a town or city. The label is commonly used to refer to organisations which relate to such a very local structure, such as neighbourhood policing or Neighbourhood watch schemes. In addition, government statistics for local areas are often referred to as neighbourhood statistics, although the data themselves are broken down usually into districts and wards for local purposes. In many parts of the UK wards are roughly equivalent to neighbourhoods or a combination of them. =North America= In Canada and the United States, neighbourhoods are often given official or semi-official status through neighbourhood associations, neighbourhood watches or block watches. These may regulate such matters as lawn care and fence height, and they may provide such services as block parties, neighbourhood parks and community security. In some other places the equivalent organisation is the parish, though a parish may have several neighbourhoods within it depending on the area. In localities where neighbourhoods do not have an official status, questions can arise as to where one neighbourhood begins and another ends. Many cities use districts and wards as official divisions of the city, rather than traditional neighbourhood boundaries. ZIP code boundaries and post office names also sometimes reflect neighbourhood identities.

Limoges is known for its medieval and Renaissance enamels (Limoges enamels) on copper, for its 19th-century porcelain (Limoges porcelain) and for its oak barrels which are used for Cognac and Bordeaux production. Some are even exported to wineries in California. Limoges has also a basketball club, the CSP Limoges, which is the only one in France to win the EuroLeague in 1993, making CSP the first club of all French collective sports to win a major European competition.  History  = Ancient and medieval history = Scarce remains of pre-urban settlements have been found in the area of Limoges. The capital of the Gaulish people of the Lemovices, who lived in the area, was probably either near Villejoubert, some kilometres south-east of Saint-L√©onard-de-Noblat, or St Gence, just west of Limoges. The city proper was founded as Augustoritum by the Romans, around 10 BC: \\"rito-\\" is Gaulish for \\"ford\\". The foundation was part of the reorganization of the province by the emperor Augustus, hence the new name. The Roman city included an amphitheatre measuring 136 x 115 metres, a theatre, a forum, baths and several sanctuaries. According to tradition, a temple consecrated to Venus, Diana, Minerva and Jupiter was located near the modern cathedral. The city was on the typical Roman square plan, with two main streets crossing in the centre. It had a Senate and a currency of its own, a sign of its importance in the imperial age. Later, like many towns and cities in Gaul, it was renamed after the tribe (here the Lemovices) whose chief town it was; \\"Lemovices\\" subsequently evolved into \\"Limoges\\", and \\"Lemovicinus\\" for the area around changed into \\"Limousin\\". Limoges was evangelized by Saint Martial, who came to the city around 250 with two companions, Alpinianus and Austriclinienus. However, in the late 3rd century it was increasingly abandoned, due to unsafe conditions created by the invasions of various Germanic tribes. The population was concentrated instead in a more easily fortifiable site, the modern Puy Saint-√âtienne, which is the centre of the modern Limoges. Starting from the construction of the Abbey of St. Martial (9th century), another settlement grew around the tomb of the saint, while a third area, next to the residence of the viscount (the future Castle of Saint Martial), seems to have been populated from the 10th century. Starting from the 11th century, thanks to the presence of the Abbey of St. Martial and its large library, Limoges became a flourishing artistic centre. It was home to an important school of medieval music composition, which is usually called the St. Martial School; its most famous member was the 13th-century troubadour Bertran de Born. Limoges enamel ciborium with champlev√© enamel, and center rim in pseudo-Kufic script, circa 1200. In the 13th century, at the peak of its splendour, central Limoges consisted of two fortified settlements. * The town proper, with a new line of walls encompassing the Vienne River, inhabited mainly by clerks and workers. It has a bridge on the Vienne river named after Saint-√âtienne, built by the bishops, and a developed port. Sacked in 1370, it never recovered entirely. * The castle, with 12 meter-high walls, including the abbey and controlled by the abbot, sometimes in contrast with the bishop- ruled town (\\"la Cit√©\\"). Traces of the walls can still be seen in the city centre. Outside the lines of walls were the popular quarters. In 1370, Limoges was occupied by Edward, the Black Prince, who massacred some 300 residents, \\"perhaps a sixth of the normal population\\", with another 60 members of the garrison of 140 dead as well.Sumption, Jonathan. 2009. The Hundred Years War III: Divided Houses. 82‚Äì83 = Modern history = Yale Mobile Hospital Unit No. 39 stationed at the Limoges factory, Christmas, 1917 The porcelain industry started to develop, favoured by the presence of kaolinite which was discovered near Limoges in 1768 (near St Yrieix, south-west of Limoges). Many of the inhabitants became employed in the new sector or in connected activities (including the lumbering of wood needed for firing the porcelain) in manufacture and exporting needed for European distribution of Limoges Boxes, dinnerware, and other porcelain wares. Because the Limousin region has had a long history of breeding (Baronet sheep and Limousine cows), the leather industry also settled in and around Limoges along the banks of the Vienne‚Äìthe river providing the necessary water and power. Factories in Limoges and St Junien still produce luxury leather shoes, gloves, and bags. The city and castle were united in 1792 to form the single city of Limoges. During the French Revolution several religious edifices, considered symbols of the Ancien R√©gime, were destroyed by the population: these included the Abbey of St. Martial itself. In the 19th century Limoges saw strong construction activity, which included the destruction and rebuilding of much of the city centre. The unsafe conditions of the poorer population is highlighted by the outbreak of several riots, including that of July‚ÄìNovember 1830 and April 1848. The first French confederation of workers, Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail (CGT) (General Confederation of Labour), was created in Limoges in 1895. In early 1905 strikes began in another local industry, shoe factories soon followed in the porcelain factories. Barricades were built, the army intervened. There would be two casualties: a horse and a young porcelain worker, Camille Vardelle. During World War II, many Jews from Alsace were evacuated to and around Limoges. = Sports = The city is one of France's basketball capitals. The Palais des Sports de Beaublanc, has been host for international basketball events such as the EuroBasket 1983 and serves as home court for the professional team CSP Limoges (Cercle St Pierre). Since 1983, the club has been French champion 11 times (1983, 1984, 1985, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994, 2000, 2014, 2015) and 5 European titles (1982, 1983, 2000 (Korac Cup), 1988 (FIBA Saporta Cup), 1993 (Euroleague)). It was the first French club team to become European champion in a collective sport. The team currently plays in Pro A, the French first basketball professional league. Limoges Hand 87 is a French handball team based in Limoges, France, which is currently playing in the Division 2 of Ligue Nationale de Handball. Limoges FC is the major city football team, currently playing in Championnat National 3 (Group A). Their home games are played at Stade St. Lazare. Limoges played in Division 1 from 1958‚Äì1961.

Climate  Limoges experiences an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb) common to much of Western France. Most precipitation occurs between October and February. On 27 December 1999, winds reached 148 km/h. On average, the city undergoes 41 days of frost and seven days of snow each winter. In June, July and August, precipitation tends to come only from violent thunderstorms coming from the Bay of Biscay.

In 1768, kaolin, a rock rich in fine, white clay which is used for making porcelain, was discovered at Saint-Yrieix-la- Perche, 30 km south of Limoges. Under the impetus of the progressive economist Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune, who had been appointed intendant of this impoverished and isolated region, a new ceramics industry was developed, and Limoges porcelain became famous during the 19th century. However, Limoges porcelain is a generic term for porcelain produced in Limoges rather than at a specific factory (there are still several porcelain factories in and around Limoges). More than 50% of all porcelain made in France comes from Limoges Limoges is mentioned in T.S. Eliot's poem Gerontion (London 1919), lines 23 to 25: \\"... Mr. Silvero/ With caressing hands, at Limoges/ Who walked all night in the next room.\\" Eliot's compatriot and mentor Ezra Pound visited Limoges in 1912 when researching the landscape and the work of the 12th-century troubadours. As he states in his essay Troubadours: Theirs Sorts and Conditions: \\"... a man may walk the hill roads and river roads from Limoges and Charente to Dordogne and Narbonne and learn a little, or more than a little, of what the country meant to the wandering singers ...\\" There is also a reference to Limoges in Jean-Paul Sartre's novel Nausea, near the middle of the book in the Shrove Tuesday section, when the magistrate says: \\"I had a similar case at the beginning of my career. It was in 1902. I was deputy magistrate at Limoges ...\\"  Transport  The main railway station of Limoges is the Gare de Limoges-B√©n√©dictins. It offers direct connections with Paris, and Toulouse, and several regional destinations. Limoges was the last major urban centre of Metropolitan France to be connected to the national motorway system; since the early 1990s, the motorway A20 connects Limoges with Chateauroux, Vierzon, Orl√©ans and Paris to the north, and Brive-la-Gaillarde, Cahors, Montauban and Toulouse to the south. The nearest airport is Limoges ‚Äì Bellegarde Airport. Urban transport in Limoges and its metropolitan area is operated by Soci√©t√© de transports en commun de Limoges M√©tropole (STCL).

Portrait by Robert Lef√®vre (1807) Charles Percier (; 22 August 1764 ‚Äì 5 September 1838) was a neoclassical French architect, interior decorator and designer, who worked in a close partnership with Pierre Fran√ßois L√©onard Fontaine, originally his friend from student days. For work undertaken from 1794 onward, trying to ascribe conceptions or details to one or other of them is fruitless; it is impossible to disentangle their cooperative efforts in this fashion. Together, Percier and Fontaine were inventors and major proponents of the rich, grand, consciously-archaeological versions of neoclassicism we recognise as Directoire style and Empire style. Following Charles Percier's death in 1838, Fontaine designed a tomb in their characteristic style in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery. Percier and Fontaine had lived together as well as being colleagues. Fontaine married late in life and after his death in 1853 his body was placed in the same tomb according to his wishes. Biography Percier was born at Paris in 1764. In 1784, at age nineteen, he won the Prix de Rome, a government-funded fellowship for study in Rome. There he met Fontaine.Another source states that Percier met Fontaine in Paris and won the Prix de Rome in 1786. See \\"Percier, Charles; and Fontaine, Pierre(-Fran√ßois-L√©onard)\\" in The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (15th edition, Chicago, 1991) 9:280:3a. \\"Percier and Fontaine became acquainted with each other while both were studying in Paris. Percier won the Prix de Rome in 1786 and spent the following years studying in Rome with Fontaine, who became his lifelong friend.\\" One early product of their collaboration was Palais, maisons et autres √©difices modernes dessin√©s √† Rome (\\"A palace, houses and other modern buildings designed in Rome\\"), which attracted the attention of prospective clients when they returned to Paris. At the end of 1792, near the end of the first phase of the French Revolution, Percier was appointed to supervise the scenery at the Paris Op√©ra, a post at the center of innovative design. Fontaine returned from the security of London, where he had been exiled, and they continued at the Op√©ra together until 1796. Claude-Louis Bernier (born 9 October 1755 died 10 January 1830, Paris) was a third member of their team. Napoleon Bonaparte liked their work. The calculated theater of the Empire style, its aggressive opulence restrained by a slightly dry and correct sense of the antique taste, and its neo-Roman values, imperial yet separate from the ancien r√©gime, appealed to the future emperor. He appointed them his personal architects and never wavered in his decision; they were at work on imperial projects almost until the very end of Napoleon's time in power. The relationship only dissolved when Napoleon retired to Elba. After the restoration of the House of Bourbon in 1814, they found themselves associated too intimately with the Empire ever to earn an official commission again. From that time forward, Percier conducted a student atelier, a teaching studio or workshop. One of Percier's pupils, Auguste de Montferrand, designed Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St Petersburg for Tsar Alexander I. They worked for ten years (1802‚Äì1812) on the Louvre. The old palace had not been a royal residence for generations, so it was free of any taint associated with the detested Bourbons. It stood in the heart of Paris, so that the vain Emperor could be seen coming and going, unlike Versailles, which, besides, had been rendered uninhabitable through destruction and looting. They worked on the Tuileries Palace that faced the Louvre across the Place du Carrousel and the parterres. In that prominent square, Percier and Fontaine designed the Arc du Carrousel (1807‚Äì1808), commemorating the Battle of Austerlitz, They also worked at Josephine's Ch√¢teau de Malmaison, at the Ch√¢teau de Montgobert for Pauline Bonaparte, and did alterations and decorations for former Bourbon palaces or castles at Compi√®gne, Saint-Cloud, and Fontainebleau. Percier and Fontaine designed every detail in their interiors: state beds, sculptural side tables, and other furniture, wall lights and candlesticks, chandeliers, door hardware, textiles, and wallpaper. On special occasions, Percier was called upon to design for the S√®vres porcelain manufactory: in 1814 Percier's published designs were adapted by Alexandre Brogniart, director of S√®vres, a grand classicising vase 137 cm tall, that came to be known as the \\"Londonderry Vase\\" when Louis XVIII gave it to the Marquess of Londonderry just before the Congress of Vienna.The vase, now at the Art Institute of Chicago, is discussed by Lynn Springer Roberts, \\"The Londonderry Vase: A Royal Gift to Curry Favor\\", Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 15.1 (1989:68‚Äì81+88) Percier and Fontaine published several later books, notably Recueil de d√©coration int√©rieure concernant tout ce qui rapporte √† l'ameublement (\\"Collection of interior designs: Everything that relates to furniture\\", 1812) with its engravings in a spare outline technique. These engravings spread their style beyond the Empire; they helped put a French stamp on the English Regency style and influenced the Dutch-British connoisseur-designer, Thomas Hope (1769‚Äì1831).

Considered a classic of 20th-century theater, it has been performed across the world in more than forty countries, and based on the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing and its related investigations and influences. Plot A 2009 production of the play at The Doon School in India The play opens with Inspector Francesco Bertozzo interrogating a clever, quick-witted and mischievous fraudster, simply known as the Maniac, in Bertozzo's office on the third floor of the police headquarters in Milan. The Maniac constantly outsmarts the dim-witted Bertozzo and, when Bertozzo leaves the room, intercepts a phone call from Inspector Pissani. Pissani reveals to the Maniac that a judge is due at the police station to investigate the interrogation and \\"accidental\\" death of the anarchist, whilst the Maniac pretends to be a colleague of Bertozzo's and telling Pissani that Bertozzo is \\"blowing a raspberry\\" at him. The Maniac decides to impersonate the judge, Marco Malipiero, an opportunity he has been waiting a while for, and to humiliate the policemen responsible for the \\"accidental\\" death. After Bertozzo reenters his office, the Maniac is forced out of the office, taking Bertozzo's coat and hat to use in his disguise. Bertozzo chases him, running into Pissani, who punches him in retaliation for \\"blowing a raspberry\\" at him. The Maniac, now impersonating Malipiero, finds Pissani and his lackey, the Constable, in the room where the anarchist was during his interrogation. Telling them that he is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was involved with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact the events of the interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, whom the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to come up to the office. As the presence of Judge Malipiero would endanger them, the policemen tell the Maniac to leave for the time being. Instead, the Maniac intends to disguise himself as a forensic expert from Rome, Captain Piccini. The Maniac leaves the office. Feletti nearly exposes the three policemen, until the Maniac reenters, as an extravagantly-dressed amputee. The Maniac manages to concoct a story on how the anarchist died: one of the impatient policemen hit the anarchist in the neck, an ambulance being called; the anarchist then being led to the window for fresh air, and pushed accidentally out of the window due to uncoordinated balance between the two policemen leading him to the window. Feletti is unconvinced, noting how the death of the anarchist was reported by the police to be a suicide, opposed to their original comment that it was \\"accidental\\". Bertozzo suddenly enters, delivering a replica of a bomb from another anarchist attack. Bertozzo partially recognises the Maniac, as he knows Captain Piccini, but is dissuaded by Pissani and the Superintendent. Feletti begins to pick out the inconsistencies in the policemen's stories, and showing that anarchists in Milan are mainly fascists, not actual revolutionaries. Bertozzo realises that \\"Piccini\\" is the Maniac, after seeing his coat and hat on a stand. Bertozzo, holding the policemen at gunpoint, orders Feletti to cuff the three policemen; getting the Maniac to show them his medical records, exposing him as a fraud. The Maniac reveals a tape recorder, which he used to record Pissani and the Superintendent's tirade, exposing their crime. The Maniac strips off his disguise, making him recognizable to Feletti, who identifies him as Paulo Davidovitch Gandolpho, the \\"Prose Pimpernel of the Permanent Revolution\\" and \\"notorious sports editor of Lotta Continua\\". Revealing that the bomb replica can in fact work, setting it off on a timer, the Maniac has Bertozzo join his fellow policemen. Feletti attempts to stop the Maniac, citing the Maniac as an \\"extremist\\" and \\"fanatic\\". The Maniac, instead of killing her, offers her an ultimatum: save the four corrupt policemen, acquitting them and the Maniac will be put behind bars; or leave them to die for their crime and unwittingly join the extremist movement as an accomplice. The Maniac then leaves to spread the recording. The Maniac then addresses the audience, showing what the scenario entails. When Feletti leaves them, the four policemen die in the resulting explosion. However, the Maniac then offers the second result: sticking to the rule of law, Feletti releases them, but is chained to the window by the policemen when they realize that Feletti knows what they did. The Maniac then leaves the audience to decide which ending they prefer.

At a population of 8,148,668 as of 2019, they account for 17.13% of the total population of Kenya making them the largest ethnic group in Kenya. The term Kikuyu is derived from the Swahili form of the word Gƒ©k≈©y≈©. means \\"large sycamore (m≈©k≈©y≈©) tree\\". Hence Agƒ©k≈©y≈© in the Kikuyu language translates to \\"children of the huge sycamore\\". The alternative name Ny≈©mba ya M≈©mbi translates to House of the Potter or Creator.

History Kikuyu man from 1910 Kikuyu woman as painted by Akseli Gallen-Kallela in 1909 Portrait of Kenosua by Gallen-Kallela, 1909‚Äì1910 =Origin= The Kikuyu belong to the Northeastern Bantu branch. Their language is most closely related to that of the Embu and Mbeere. Geographically, they are concentrated in the vicinity of Mount Kenya. The exact place that the Northeast Bantu speakers migrated from after the initial Bantu expansion is uncertain. Some authorities suggest that the Kikuyu arrived in their present Mount Kenya area of habitation from earlier settlements further to the north and east,Joseph Bindloss, Tom Parkinson, Matt Fletcher, Lonely Planet Kenya, (Lonely Planet: 2003), p.35. while others argue that the Kikuyu, along with their closely related Eastern Bantu neighbors the Embu, Meru, Mbeere, and Kamba moved into Kenya from points further north. Arnold Curtis, Kenya: a visitor's guide, (Evans Brothers: 1985), p.7. From archaeological evidence, their arrival at the northern side of Mt. Kenya dates to around the 3rd century, as part of the larger group known as Thagicu. By the 6th century, there was a community of Agikuyu newly established at Gatung'ang'a in Nyeri. The Agikuyu established themselves in their current homeland of Mt. Kenya region by the 13th century. =Before 1888= The nation and its pursuits Before the establishment of East Africa Protectorate in the 1895, the Agƒ©k≈©y≈© preserved geographic and political power from almost all external influence for many generations; they had never been subdued. Before the arrival of the British, Arabs involved in slave trade and their caravans passed at the southern edges of the Agƒ©k≈©y≈© nation. Slavery as an institution did not exist amongst the Agƒ©k≈©y≈©, nor did they make raids for the capture of slaves. The Arabs who tried to venture into Agƒ©k≈©y≈© land met instant death. Relying on a combination of land purchases, blood-brotherhood (partnerships), intermarriage with other people, and their adoption and absorption, the Agƒ©k≈©y≈© were in a constant state of territorial expansion. Economically, the Agƒ©k≈©y≈© were great farmers and shrewd businesspeople. Besides farming and business, the Agƒ©k≈©y≈© were involved in small scale industries with professions such as bridge building, string making, wire drawing, and iron chain making. The Agƒ©k≈©y≈© had a great sense of justice (kƒ©hooto). Social and political life The Agƒ©k≈©y≈© nation was divided into nine clans. Each clan traced its lineage to a single female ancestor and a daughter of Mumbi. The clans were not restricted to any particular geographical area, they lived side by side. Some clans had a recognised leader, others did not. However, in either case, real political power was exercised by the ruling council of elders for each clan. Each clan then forwarded the leader of its council to the apex council of elders for the whole community. The overall council of elders representing all the clans, was then led by a headman or the nation's spokesman. Spirituality and religion =Ngai ‚Äì The Supreme Creator= The Gƒ©k≈©y≈© were ‚Äì and still are ‚Äì monotheists believing in an omnipotent God whom they refer to as Ngai. All of the Gƒ©k≈©y≈©, Embu, and Kamba use this name. Ngai was also known as M≈©rungu by the Meru and Embu tribes, or M≈©lungu (a variant of a word meaning God) . The title Mwathani or Mwathi (the greatest ruler) comes from the word gwatha meaning to rule or reign with authority, was and is still used. All sacrifices to Ngai were performed under a sycamore tree (M≈©k≈©y≈©) and if one was not available, a fig tree (M≈©gumo) would be used. The olive tree (M≈©tamaiy≈©) was a sacred tree for women. =Mount Kenya and religion= Ngai or Mwene-Nyaga is the Supreme Creator and giver of all things. He created the first Gƒ©k≈©y≈© communities, and provided them with all the resources necessary for life: land, rain, plants, and animals. Ngai cannot be seen but is manifested in the sun, moon, stars, comets and meteors, thunder and lightning, rain, rainbows, and in the great fig trees (Mugumo). These trees served as places of worship and sacrifice and marked the spot at M≈©k≈©r≈©e wa Gathanga where Gƒ©k≈©y≈© and M≈©mbi ‚Äì the ancestors of the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© in the oral legend ‚Äì first settled. Ngai has human characteristics, and although some say that he lives in the sky or in the clouds, Gƒ©k≈©y≈© lore also says that Ngai comes to earth from time to time to inspect it, bestow blessings, and mete out punishment. When he comes, Ngai rests on Mount Kenya (Kƒ´rƒ´nyaga)and Kilimambogo (kƒ©rƒ©ma kƒ©a njahƒ©). Thunder is interpreted to be the movement of Ngai and lightning is the weapon used by Ngai to clear the way when moving from one sacred place to another. Some people believe that Ngai's abode is on Mount Kenya. In one legend, Ngai made the mountain his resting place while on an inspection tour of earth. Ngai then took the first man, Gikuyu, to the top to point out the beauty of the land he was giving him. =Philosophy of the Traditional Kikuyu Religion= The cardinal points in this Traditional Gƒ©k≈©y≈© Religion Philosophy were squarely based on the general Bantu peoples thought as follows: #The universe is composed of interacting and interconnected forces whose manifestation is the physical things we see, including ourselves and those we don't see. #All those forces (things) in the universe came from God who, from the beginning of time, have had the vital divine force of creation within himself. #Everything created by God retains a bond from God (Creator) to the created. #The first humans who were created by God have the strongest vital force because they got it directly from God. #Because these first humans sit just below God in power, they are almost like Gods or even can be Gods. #The current parent of an individual is the link to God through the immediate dead and through ancestors. #On Earth, humans have the highest quantity of vital force. #All the other things (forces) on Earth were created to enable human vital force (being) become stronger. #All things have vital force but some objects, plants and animals have higher vital force than others. #A human can use an animal to symbolize the level of his vital force compared to other humans. #There is a specific point within every physical manifestation (thing) of vital force where most that force is concentrated. #A human can easily manipulate things to his advantage or to their detriment by identifying this point of concentration of vital force. There are human beings who have more knowledge of these forces and can manipulate them at will usually by invoking higher forces to assist. #Higher forces are invoked by humans using lower forces (animal or plant sacrifice) as intermediaries. To approach higher forces directly is thahu (abomination which leads to a curse). #The human society has some few elite people very skilled in the art of manipulating forces to strengthen a human(s) force or diminish it, strengthen any force below human force or diminish it. #The leader of a human society is the one possessing the highest vital force as at that time or the one closest to God or both. Since the leader of this human society has the highest vital force and hence closer to God than any other person, he should be able to nourish the rest of the people by linking them to the ultimate God and by being able to command lower forces to act in such a way so as to reinforce the other humans vital force. #The life force of a dead ancestor can come back to life through the act of birth of a new child, especially when the child is named after the departed ancestor and all is seen to be well. The Gƒ©k≈©y≈© held a belief in the interconnection of everything in the universe. To the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people, everything we see had an inner spiritual force and the most sacred though unspoken ontology was being is force. This spiritual vital force originated from God, who had the power to create or destroy that life force. To the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people, God was the supreme being in the universe and the giver(M≈©gai/Ngai) of this life force to everything that exists. Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people also believed that everything God created had a vital inner force and a connection bond to Him by the mere fact that he created that thing and gave it that inner force that makes it be and be manifested physically. To the Agƒ©k≈©y≈©, God had this life force within himself hence He was the ultimate owner and ruler of everything in the universe. The latter was the ultimate conception of God among the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people hence the name M≈©gai/Ngai. To the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people, those who possessed the greatest life force, those closest to God were the first parents created by God because God directly gave them the vital living force. These first parents were so respected to be treated almost like God himself. These were followed by the ancestors of the people who inherited life force from the first parents, then followed by the immediate dead and finally the eldest in the community. Hence when people wanted to offer sacrifices, the eldest in the community would perform the rites. Children in the community had a link to God through their parents and that chain would move upwards to parent parents, ancestors, first created parents until it reaches God Himself. The Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people believed the departed spirits of the ancestors can be reborn again in this world when children are being born, hence the rites performed during the child naming ceremonies. The Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people believed the vital life force or soul of a person can be increased or diminished, thereby affecting the person's health. They also believed that some people possessed power to manipulate the inner force in all things. These people who increased the well being of a person spirit were called medicine- men (M≈©go) while those who diminished the person's life force were called witchdoctors (M≈©rogi). They also believed that ordinary items can have their spiritual powers increased such that they protect a person against those bent on diminishing a person vital life force. Such an item with such powers was called gƒ©thit≈©. Thus, the philosophy of the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© religion and life in general was anchored on the understanding that everything in the universe has an inner interlinked force that we do not see. God among the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people was understood hence to be the owner and distributor(M≈©gai) of this inner life force in all things and He was worshiped and praised to either increase the life force of all things (farm produce, cattle, children) the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people possessed and minimize events that led to catastrophes that would diminish the life force of the people or lead to death. The leader of the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people was the person who was thought to possess the greatest life force among the people or the person who had demonstrated the greatest life force in taking care of the people, their families, their farm produce, their cattle and their land. This person was hence thought to be closer to God than anybody else living in that nation.The said person also had to demonstrate and practice the highest levels of truth (maa) and justice (kihooto), just like the supreme God of the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people would do. Political structures and generational change A Gikuyu man and his wife in 2020 at Kenya. The Agƒ©k≈©y≈© had four seasons and two harvests in one year. # Mbura ya njahƒ© (the season of big rain) from March to July, # Magetha ma njahƒ© (njahƒ© being Lablab purpureus) (the season of the black bean harvest) between July and Early October, # Mbura ya Mwere (short rain season) from October to January, # Magetha ma Mwere (the season of harvesting) millet√†, # Mbura ya Kƒ©mera. Further, time was recorded through the initiation by circumcision. Each initiation group was given a special name. According to Professor Godfrey M≈©ri≈©ki, the individual initiation sets are then grouped into a regiment every nine calendar years. Before a regiment or army was set, there was a period in which no initiation of boys took place. This period lasted a total of four and a half calendar years (nine seasons in Gƒ©k≈©y≈© land, each season referred to as imera) and is referred to as m≈©hingo, with initiation taking place at the start of the fifth year and going on annually for the next nine calendar years. This was the system adopted in Metumi Murang'a. The regiment or army sets also get special names, some of which seem to have ended up as popular male names. In Gaki Nyeri the system was inversed with initiation taking place annually for four calendar years, which would be followed by a period of nine calendar years in which no initiation of boys took place (m≈©hingo). Girls on the other hand were initiated every year. Several regiments then make up a ruling generation. It was estimated that ruling generations lasted an average of 35 years. The names of the initiation and regiment sets vary within Gƒ©k≈©y≈© land. The ruling generations are however uniform and provide very important chronological data. On top of that, the initiation sets were a way of documenting events within the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© nation, so, for example, were the occurrence of smallpox and syphilis recorded. Girls‚Äô initiation sets were also accorded special names, although there has been little research in this area. M≈©ri≈©ki only unearths three sets, whose names are, R≈©haro [1894], Kibiri/Nd≈©rƒ©rƒ© [1895], Kagica [1896], Ndutu/Nuthi [1897]. All these names are taken from Metumi (M≈©rang‚Äôa) and Kabete Kƒ©ambu. * Manjiri 1512 ‚Äì 1546 ¬± 55 * Mamba 1547 ‚Äì 1581 ¬± 50 * Tene 1582 ‚Äì 1616 ¬± 45 * Aagu 1617 ‚Äì 1651 ¬± 40 * Manduti 1652 ‚Äì 1686 ¬± 40 * Cuma 1687 ‚Äì 1721 ¬± 30 * Ciira 1722 ‚Äì 1756 ¬± 25 * Mathathi 1757 ‚Äì 1791 ¬± 20 * Ndemi 1792 ‚Äì 1826 ¬± 15 * Iregi 1827 ‚Äì 1861 ¬± 10 * Maina 1862 ‚Äì 1897 ¬± 5 * Mwangi 1898? Mathew Njoroge Kabet≈©s list reads, Tene, Kƒ©yƒ©, Aagu, Ciƒ©ra, Mathathi, Ndemi, Iregi, Maina (Ngotho), Mwangi. Gakaara wa Wanja≈©s list reads Tene, Nema Thƒ©, Karira≈©, Aagu, Tiru, Cuma, Ciira, Ndemi, Mathathi, Iregi, Maina, Mwangi, Ir≈©ng≈©', Mwangi wa Mand≈©ti. The last two generations came after 1900. One of the earliest recorded lists by McGregor reads (list taken from a history of unchanged) Manjiri, Mand≈©ti, Chiera, Masai, Mathathi, Ndemi, Iregi, Maina, Mwangi, M≈©ir≈©ng≈©. According to Hobley (a historian) each initiation generation, riika, extended over two years. The ruling generation at the arrival of the Europeans was called Maina. It is said that Maina handed over to Mwangi in 1898. Hobley asserts that the following sets were grouped under Maina ‚Äì Kƒ©n≈©thia, Karanja, Nj≈©g≈©na, Kƒ©nyanjui, Gathuru and Ng‚Äôang‚Äôa. Professor M≈©ri≈©ki however puts these sets much earlier, namely Karanja and Kƒ©n≈©thia belong to the Ciira ruling generation which ruled from the year 1722 to 1756, give or take 25 years, according to M≈©ri≈©ki. Nj≈©g≈©na, Kƒ©nyanjui, Ng‚Äôang‚Äôa belong to the Mathathi ruling generation that ruled from 1757 to 1791, give or take 20 years, according to M≈©ri≈©ki. Professor M≈©ri≈©kis list must be given precedence in this area as he conducted extensive research in this area starting 1969, and had the benefit of all earlier literature on the subject as well as doing extensive field work in the areas of Gaki (Nyeri), Metumi (M≈©rang‚Äôa) and Kabete (Kƒ©ambu). On top of the ruling generations, he also gives names of the regiments or army sets from 1659 [within a margin of error] and the names of annual initiation sets beginning 1864. The list from Metumi (M≈©rang‚Äôa) is most complete and differentiated. M≈©ri≈©kis is also the most systematically defined list, so far. Suffice to say that most of the most popular male names in Gƒ©k≈©y≈© land were names of riikas (initiation sets). Here is M≈©ri≈©kis list of the names of regiment sets in Metumi (M≈©rang‚Äôa). These include Kiariƒ© (1665‚Äì1673), Cege (1678‚Äì1678), Kamau (1704‚Äì1712), Kƒ©mani (1717‚Äì1725), Karanja (1730‚Äì1738), Kƒ©n≈©thia (1743‚Äì1751), Nj≈©g≈©na (1756‚Äì1764), Kƒ©nyanjui (1769‚Äì1777), Ng‚Äôang‚Äôa (1781‚Äì1789), Njoroge (1794‚Äì1802), Wainaina (1807‚Äì1815), Kang‚Äôethe (1820‚Äì1828) Mb≈©gua (1859‚Äì1867), Njenga or Mbƒ©ra Itim≈© (1872‚Äì1880), M≈©t≈©ng‚Äô≈© or Mb≈©r≈© (1885‚Äì1893). H.E. Lambert who dealt with the riikas extensively has the following list of regiment sets from Gich≈©g≈© and Ndia. It should be remembered that this names were unlike ruling generations not uniform in Gƒ©k≈©y≈© land. It should also be noted that Ndia and Gach≈©g≈© followed a system where initiation took place every annually for four years and then a period of nine calendar years followed where no initiation of boys took place. This period was referred to as m≈©hingo. Karanja (1759‚Äì1762), Kƒ©n≈©thia (1772‚Äì1775), Nd≈©rƒ©rƒ© (1785‚Äì1788), M≈©gacho (1798‚Äì1801), Njoroge (1811‚Äì1814), Kang‚Äôethe (1824‚Äì1827), Gita≈© (1837‚Äì1840), Manyaki (1850‚Äì1853), Kiamb≈©thi (1863‚Äì1866), Watuke (1876‚Äì1879), Ng≈©gƒ© (1889‚Äì1892), Wakanene (1902‚Äì1905). The remarkable thing in this list in comparison to the Metumi one is how some of the same names are used, if a bit offset. Ndia and Gach≈©g≈© are extremely far from Metumi. Gaki on the other hand, as far as my geographical understanding of Gƒ©k≈©y≈© land is concerned should be much closer to Metumi, yet virtually no names of regiment sets are shared. It should however be noted that Gaki had a strong connection to the Maasai living nearby. The ruling generation names of Maina and Mwangi are also very popular male Gƒ©k≈©y≈© names. The theory is also that Waciira is also derived from ciira (case), which is also a very popular masculine name among the Agƒ©k≈©y≈©. This would call into question, when it was exactly that children started being named after the parents of one's parents. Had that system, of naming one's children after one's parents been there from the beginning, there would be very few male names in circulation. This is however not the case, as there are very many Gƒ©k≈©y≈© male names. One theory is that the female names are much less, with the names of the full-nine daughters of M≈©mbi being most prevalent. Gakaara wa Wanja≈© supports this view when he writes in his book, Mƒ©hƒ©rƒ©ga ya Aagƒ©k≈©y≈©. Hingo ƒ©yo ciana cia ar≈©me ciatuagwo marƒ©ƒ©twa ma mariika ta Watene, Cuma, Iregi kana Ciira. Nao airƒ©ƒ©tu magatuuo marƒ©ƒ©twa ma mƒ©hƒ©rƒ©ga tauria hagwetetwo nah au kabere, o nginya hingo iria maundu maatabariirwo thuuthaini ati ciana ituagwo aciari a mwanake na a muirƒ©ƒ©tu. Freely translated it means \\"In those days the male children were given the names of the riika (initiation set) like Watene, Cuma, Iregi or Ciira. Girls were on the other hand named after the clans that were named earlier until such a time as it was decided to name the children after the parents of the man and the woman.\\" From this statement it is not clear whether the girls were named ad hoc after any clan, no matter what clan the parents belonged to. Naming them after the specific clan that the parents belonged to would have severely restricted naming options. This would strangely mean that the female names are the oldest in Gƒ©k≈©y≈© land, further confirming its matrilineal descent. As far as male names are concerned, there is of course the chicken and the egg question, of when a name specifically appeared but some names are tied to events that happened during the initiation. For example, Wainaina refers to those who shivered during circumcision. K≈©inaina (to shake or to shiver). There was a very important ceremony known as Ituƒ©ka in which the old guard would hand over the reins of government to the next generation. This was to avoid dictatorship. Kenyatta related how once, in the land of the Agƒ©k≈©y≈©, there ruled a despotic King called Gƒ©k≈©y≈©, grandson of the elder daughter (Wanjir≈© according to Leakey) of the original Gƒ©k≈©y≈© of Gƒ©k≈©y≈© and M≈©mbi fame. After he was deposed, it was decided that the government should be democratic, which is how the Ituƒ©ka came to be. This legend of course calls into question exactly when it was that the matrilineal rule set in. The last Ituƒ©ka ceremony, where the riika of Maina handed over power to the Mwangi generation, took place in 1898-9. The next one was supposed to be held in 1925‚Äì1928 [Kenyatta] but was thwarted by the colonial imperialist government and one by one Gƒ©k≈©y≈© institutions crumbled Collapse of traditional political structure The ruling generations, the rƒ©ƒ©ka system can be traced back to the year 1500 AD or thereabouts. These were: * Manjiri 1512 to 1546 * Mamba 1547 to 1581 * Tene 1582 to 1616 * Agu 1617 to 1652 * Manduti 1652 to 1686 * Cuma 1687 to 1721 * Ciira 1722 to 1756 * Mathathi 1757 to 1791 * Ndemi 1792 to 1826 * Iregi 1827 to 1861 * Maina 1862 to 1897 * Mwangi 1898 The last Ituƒ©ka ceremony where the rƒ©ƒ©ka of Maina handed over power to the Mwangi generation, took place in 1898‚Äì1899. The next one was supposed to be held in 1925‚Äì1928 but was thwarted by the colonial government. The traditional symbols of power among the Agikuyu nation is the Muthƒ©gi (Stick) which signifies power to lead and the Itim≈© (Spear) signifying power to call people to war. =1888‚Äì1945= The traditional way of life of Agikuyu was disrupted when they came into contact with British people around 1888. The aim of these Europeans was to subdue the local population, colonise and take over their rich agricultural land. The colonial takeover was met with strong local resistance: Waiyaki Wa Hinga, a leader of the southern Agikuyu, who ruled Dagoretti who had signed a treaty with Frederick Lugard of the British East Africa Company (BEAC), having been subject to considerable harassment, burned down Lugard's fort in 1890. Waiyaki was abducted two years later by the British and killed. Kikuyu chief Wanbugu (seated center) in talks with the High Commissioner of the East Africa Protectorate c. 1910 Following severe financial difficulties of the British East Africa Company, the British government on 1 July 1895 established direct rule, by force, through the East African Protectorate, subsequently opening (1902) the fertile highlands to British settlers. The Agikuyu simply killed almost any member of the Agikuyu nation that helped the British to subdue the Agikuyu. In response the British employed crude methods to retaliate. Failing compliance in such a case, some five hundred of the Masai tribe, the hereditary enemies of the Akikuyu, would then be summoned, and with the addition of some regular local conscripted troops and police the country would be scoured. The men were killed, and the women, children, and herds taken captive until such time as, experience having been dearly bought, another meeting procured the requisite submission. Having tried to violently resist British occupation and colonisation by force and failed between 1895‚Äì1920, the Agikuyu people resorted to political means of resistance. Kenya became a military base for the British in the First World War (1914‚Äì18), as efforts to subdue the German colony to the south were frustrated. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, the governors of British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa agreed a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. However Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck took command of the German military forces, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible. Completely cut off from Germany, von Lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated. He eventually surrendered in Zambia eleven days after the Armistice was signed in 1918. To chase von Lettow the British deployed Indian Army troops from India and then needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior by foot. The Carrier Corps was formed and ultimately mobilised over 400,000 Africans, contributing to their long-term politicisation. The experiences gained by Africans in the war, coupled with the creation of the white-settler-dominated Kenya Crown Colony, gave rise to considerable political activity in the 1920s which culminated in Archdeacon Owen's \\"Piny Owacho\\" (Voice of the People) movement and the \\"Young Kikuyu Association\\" (renamed the \\"East African Association\\") started in 1921 by Harry Thuku (1895‚Äì1970), which gave a sense of nationalism to many Kikuyu and advocated civil disobedience.Thuku's campaign against colonial injustices was short lived. He was exiled to Kismayu the following year, and it was not until 1924 that the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA) was formed to carry on with Thuku's campaign. From 1924, the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA),with Jomo Kenyatta as its Secretary General focused on unifying the Kikuyu into one geographic polity, but its project was undermined by controversies over ritual tribute, land allocation, the ban on female circumcision, and support for Thuku.The KCA sent Kenyatta to England in 1924 and again in 1931 to air their grievances against British occupation and rule. By the 1930s, approximately 30,000 white settlers lived in Agikuyu country and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy. The area was already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu nation, most of whom had been deprived of their land by the European settlers, and lived as itinerant farmers. To protect their interests, the settlers banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour. A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled. In the Second World War (1939‚Äì45) Kenya became an important British military base. For the Agikuyu soldiers who took part in the war as part of the King's African Rifles (KAR), the war stimulated African nationalism and exposed the weakness of the Europeans who were oppressing them at home. Meanwhile, on the political front, in 1944 Thuku founded and was first chairman of the multi-ethnic Kenya African Study Union (KASU). =1945‚Äì1963= First President of Kenya Jomo Kenyatta In 1946 KASU became the Kenya African Union (KAU). It was a nationalist organisation that demanded access to white-owned land. KAU acted as a constituency association for the first black member of Kenya's legislative council, Eliud Mathu, who had been nominated in 1944 by the governor after consulting with the local Bantu/Nilotic elite. The KAU remained dominated by the Kikuyu ethnic group. In 1947 Jomo Kenyatta, the former president of the moderate Kikuyu Central Association, became president of the more aggressive KAU to demand a greater political voice for the native inhabitants. The failure of the KAU to attain any significant reforms or redress of grievances from the colonial authorities shifted the political initiative to younger and more militant figures within the African trade union movement, among the squatters on the settler estates in the Rift Valley and in KAU branches in Nairobi and the Kikuyu districts of central province By 1952, under Field Marshal Dedan Kimathi, the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (Mau Mau) launched a full military conflict on the British military, settlers and their native allies. By this time the Mau Mau was fighting for total independence of Kenya. The war is considered by some the gravest crisis of Britain's African coloniesRobbins, Richard H. (2008). 'Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism (4th Ed.). Pearson Education, Inc. P. 315. The capture of rebel leader Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 signalled the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau Uprising, and essentially ended the British military campaign although the state of emergency would last until 1959. The conflict arguably set the stage for Kenyan independence in December 1963. =1963‚Äìpresent= Governor of Central Bank of Kenya Ngugi Njoroge Since the proclamation of the Republic of Kenya, after the British colony of Kenya came to an end in 1963, the Agikuyu now form an integral part of the Kenyan nation. They continue to play their part as citizens of Kenya, helping to build their country. However, some Kenyans resent their incorrectly perceived superior economic status, a resentment sometimes vented through political violence, as happened in 1992, 1997 and 2007 Kenyan elections. Genetics According to a Y-Chromosome DNA study by Wood et al. (2005), around 73% of Gƒ©k≈©y≈©s belong to the common paternal haplogroup E1b1a. The remainder carry other clades: 19% E1b1b with E-M293 contributing 11%,Trombetta, Beniamino et al. ‚ÄúPhylogeographic Refinement and Large Scale Genotyping of Human Y Chromosome Haplogroup E Provide New Insights into the Dispersal of Early Pastoralists in the African Continent.‚Äù Genome Biology and Evolution (2015). 2% A, and 2% B.De Filippo C, Barbieri C, Whitten M, et al.

In terms of maternal lineages, Gƒ©k≈©y≈©s closely cluster with other Eastern Bantu groups like the Sukuma. Most belong to various Africa-centered mtDNA macro-haplogroup L lineages such as L0f, L3x, L4g and L5 per Castr√¨ et al. (2009). According to Salas et al. (2002), other Gƒ©k≈©y≈©s largely carry the L1a clade, which is one of the African mtDNA Haplogroups. Culture Statue of Mau Mau Freedom Fighter Dedan Kimathi =Language= Gƒ©k≈©y≈©s speak the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© language as their native tongue, which is a member of the Bantu subgroup of the Niger‚ÄìCongo language family. Additionally, many speak Swahili and English as lingua franca, the two official languages of Kenya. The Gƒ©k≈©y≈© are closely related to some bantu communities due to intermarriages prior to colonization. These communities are the Embu, Meru, and Akamba people who also live around Mt. Kenya. Members of the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© family from the greater Kiambu (commonly referred to as the Kabete) and Nyeri districts are closely related to the Maasai people also due to intermarriage prior to colonization. The Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people between Thika and Mbeere are closely related to the Kamba people who speak a language similar to Gƒ©k≈©y≈©. As a result, the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people that retain much of the original Gƒ©k≈©y≈© heritage reside around Kirinyaga and Murang'a regions of Kenya. The Murang'a district is considered by many to be the cradle of the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© people and as such, Gƒ©k≈©y≈©'s from the Murang'a area are considered to be of a purer breed. =Literature= Until 1888, the Agikuyu literature was purely expressed in folklore. Famous stories include The Maiden Who Was Sacrificed By Her Kin, The Lost Sister, The Four Young Warriors, The Girl who Cut the Hair of the N'jenge, and many more. When the European missionaries arrived in the Agikuyu country in 1888, they learned the Kikuyu language and started writing it using a modified Roman alphabet. The Kikuyu responded strongly to missionaries and European education. They had greater access to education and opportunities for involvement in the new money economy and political changes in their country. As a consequence, there are notable Kikuyu literature icons such as Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o and Meja Mwangi. Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o's literary works include Caitani Mutharabaini (1981), Matigari (1986) and Murogi wa Kagogo (Wizard of the Crow (2006)) which is the largest known Kikuyu language novel having been translated into more than thirty languages. =Music= Traditional Kikuyu music has existed for generations up to 1888, when the Agikuyu people encountered and adopted a new culture from the Europeans. Before 1888 and well into the 1920s, Kikuyu music included Kibaata, Nduumo and Muthunguci. Cultural loss increased as urbanization and modernization impacted on indigenous knowledge, including the ability to play the m≈©t≈©rƒ©r≈© - an oblique bark flute. Today, music and dance are strong components of Kikuyu culture. There is a vigorous Kikuyu recording industry, for both secular and gospel music, in their pentatonic scale and western music styles such as \\"Mathwiti Maigi Ngai!\\". =Cinema= Kikuyu cinema and film production are a very recent phenomenon among the Agikuyu. They have become popular only in the 21st century. In the 20th century, most of the Agikuyu consumed cinema and film produced in the west. Popular Kikuyu film productions include comedies such as Machang'i series and Kihenjo series. Recently, Kenyan television channels have increased greatly and there are channels that broadcast programs in the Kikuyu language. =Cuisine= Typical Agƒ©k≈©y≈© food includes Yams, sweet potatoes,Gƒ´theri (maize and beans, after corns was introduced to Africa), M≈´kimo (mashed green peas and potatoes), Kƒ´mit≈´ (mashed beans and potatoes), Irio (mashed dry beans, corn and potatoes), M≈´tura (sausage made using goat intestines, meat and blood), ≈™c≈´r≈´ (fermented porridge made from flour of corn, millet or sorghum) roast goat, beef, chicken and cooked green vegetables such as collards, spinach and carrots. =Religion= Although Gƒ©k≈©y≈©s historically adhered to indigenous faiths, most are Christians today. = Religious and cultural discord = In April 2018, the Presbyterian Church of East Africa made a resolution to prohibit its members from the Kikuyu cultural rite known as ‚ÄúMburi cia Kiama‚Äù and this triggered disturbances among devotees in the region of Mount Kenya. The ‚ÄúMburi cia Kiama‚Äù entails the slaughtering of goats and advising men on how to become respected elders. When this process is over, they join different ‚Äúkiamas‚Äù (groups). It is in these groups that they are given advice on issues like marriage, the Kikuyu culture and community responsibilities. Members of the church were given the ultimatum to renounce the cultural practice or to leave the church‚Äôs fold.https://www.nation.co.ke/news/PCEA-ban-on-Kikuyu-rite-sparks-big- storm/1056-4577196-a389dz/index.html List of prominent Agikƒ©k≈©y≈© and people of Gƒ©k≈©y≈© descent Nobel Peace Prize Winner Wangari Maathai =Activism, authorship, academics and science= * Wangari Maathai, Nobel Laureate, first African woman and first environmentalist to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Gili Islands are on the Lombok side. Its narrowest point is at its southern opening, with a width of about between the islands of Lombok and Nusa Penida, in the middle of the strait. At the northern opening, it is across. Its total length is about . Because it is minimum deep ‚Äî much deeper than the Strait of Malacca ‚Äî ships that draw too much water to pass through Malacca (so-called \\"post Malaccamax\\" vessels) often use the Lombok Strait, instead. The Lombok Strait is notable as one of the main passages for the Indonesian Throughflow that exchanges water between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It is also part of the biogeographical boundary between the fauna of the Indomalayan realm and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The boundary is known as the Wallace Line, for Alfred Russel Wallace, who first remarked upon the striking difference between animals of Indomalaya and those of Australasia and how abrupt the boundary was between the two biomes. Biologists believe it was the depth of the Lombok Strait itself that kept the animals on either side isolated from one another. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, the islands of Bali, Java and Sumatra were all connected to one another and to the mainland of Asia. They shared the Asian fauna. The Lombok Strait's deep water kept Lombok and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated from the Asian mainland. These islands were, instead, colonized by Australasian fauna.

It is used for developing audio and voice response applications, such as banking systems and automated customer service portals. VoiceXML applications are developed and deployed in a manner analogous to how a web browser interprets and visually renders the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) it receives from a web server. VoiceXML documents are interpreted by a voice browser and in common deployment architectures, users interact with voice browsers via the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The VoiceXML document format is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). It is a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Usage VoiceXML applications are commonly used in many industries and segments of commerce. These applications include order inquiry, package tracking, driving directions, emergency notification, wake-up, flight tracking, voice access to email, customer relationship management, prescription refilling, audio news magazines, voice dialing, real-estate information and national directory assistance applications. VoiceXML has tags that instruct the voice browser to provide speech synthesis, automatic speech recognition, dialog management, and audio playback. The following is an example of a VoiceXML document: Hello world! When interpreted by a VoiceXML interpreter this will output \\"Hello world\\" with synthesized speech. Typically, HTTP is used as the transport protocol for fetching VoiceXML pages. Some applications may use static VoiceXML pages, while others rely on dynamic VoiceXML page generation using an application server like Tomcat, Weblogic, IIS, or WebSphere. Historically, VoiceXML platform vendors have implemented the standard in different ways, and added proprietary features. But the VoiceXML 2.0 standard, adopted as a W3C Recommendation on 16 March 2004, clarified most areas of difference. The VoiceXML Forum, an industry group promoting the use of the standard, provides a conformance testing process that certifies vendors' implementations as conformant. History AT&T; Corporation, IBM, Lucent, and Motorola formed the VoiceXML Forum in March 1999, in order to develop a standard markup language for specifying voice dialogs. By September 1999 the Forum released VoiceXML 0.9 for member comment, and in March 2000 they published VoiceXML 1.0. Soon afterwards, the Forum turned over the control of the standard to the W3C. The W3C produced several intermediate versions of VoiceXML 2.0, which reached the final \\"Recommendation\\" stage in March 2004. VoiceXML 2.1 added a relatively small set of additional features to VoiceXML 2.0, based on feedback from implementations of the 2.0 standard. It is backward compatible with VoiceXML 2.0 and reached W3C Recommendation status in June 2007.  Future versions of the standard VoiceXML 3.0 will be the next major release of VoiceXML, with new major features. It includes a new XML statechart description language called SCXML.  Related standards  The W3C's Speech Interface Framework also defines these other standards closely associated with VoiceXML. = SRGS and SISR = The Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) is used to tell the speech recognizer what sentence patterns it should expect to hear: these patterns are called grammars. Once the speech recognizer determines the most likely sentence it heard, it needs to extract the semantic meaning from that sentence and return it to the VoiceXML interpreter. This semantic interpretation is specified via the Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR) standard. SISR is used inside SRGS to specify the semantic results associated with the grammars, i.e., the set of ECMAScript assignments that create the semantic structure returned by the speech recognizer. = SSML = The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is used to decorate textual prompts with information on how best to render them in synthetic speech, for example which speech synthesizer voice to use or when to speak louder or softer. = PLS = The Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS) is used to define how words are pronounced. The generated pronunciation information is meant to be used by both speech recognizers and speech synthesizers in voice browsing applications. = CCXML = The Call Control eXtensible Markup Language (CCXML) is a complementary W3C standard. A CCXML interpreter is used on some VoiceXML platforms to handle the initial call setup between the caller and the voice browser, and to provide telephony services like call transfer and disconnect to the voice browser. CCXML can also be used in non-VoiceXML contexts. = MSML, MSCML, MediaCTRL = In media server applications, it is often necessary for several call legs to interact with each other, for example in a multi-party conference. Some deficiencies were identified in VoiceXML for this application and so companies designed specific scripting languages to deal with this environment. The Media Server Markup Language (MSML) was Convedia's solution, and Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) was Snowshore's solution. Snowshore is now owned by Dialogic and Convedia is now owned by Radisys. These languages also contain 'hooks' so that external scripts (like VoiceXML) can run on call legs where IVR functionality is required. There was an IETF working group called mediactrl (\\"media control\\") that was working on a successor for these scripting systems, which it is hoped will progress to an open and widely adopted standard. The mediactrl working group concluded in 2013.https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mediactrl/history/ See also *ECMAScript ‚Äì the scripting language used in VoiceXML *OpenVXI ‚Äì an open source VoiceXML interpreter library *SCXML ‚Äì State Chart XML References External links *W3C's Voice Browser Working Group, Official VoiceXML Standards *VoiceXML Forum, VoiceXML Trademark Holder * *VoiceXML tutorials World Wide Web Consortium standards XML-based standards Markup languages Speech synthesis XML- based programming languages VoIP protocols 2000 software ","title":"VoiceXML"},{"id":"177207","text":"The Karimata Strait () also spelled Carimata or Caramata is the wide strait that connects the South China Sea to the Java Sea, separating the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo (Kalimantan). It is bordered by the Belitung island (off Sumatra's eastern coast) in the west and Borneo in the east. It is the widest strait that connects the South China Sea and the Java Sea (other straits include the Bangka and Gaspar straits), but its numerous islands and reefs reduce its navigability. Its weather and current is influenced by the annual southeast and northwest monsoon. It was used as an invasion route by the British fleet in the 1811 Invasion of Java in the Dutch East Indies. More recently, it was the site of the crash of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501, and the location of the 2016 edition of Sail Indonesia (dubbed \\"Sail Karimata Strait\\").  Geography  The strait is about wide from the east coast of Belitung (also known as Billiton) to the west coast of Borneo (Kalimantan). The much narrower Gaspar Strait separates Belitung from Bangka Island to the west. Bangka lies close to the east coast of Sumatra, separated from it by the Bangka Strait. To the east of Belitung lie reefs and a group of islets known as the Montaran Islands, extending up to from Belitung's northeastern coast. The Karimata Islands lie in the eastern part of the Karimata strait, northeast of Belitung, southwest of Maja Island and off-shore from the west coast of Borneo. The presence of these islands and reefs reduce the width of the main navigable channel to about . Outside this main fairway, there are multiple navigable channels to the east of Karimata Islands or between the islands. The rivers of Kapuas, Kendawangan, Pawan, and Sambas in Borneo, as well as Barumun and Musi in Sumatra flow to the strait. = Climate = The southeast monsoon prevails in the strait from about the end of May, which comes with strong southeast or south-southeast wind, a dry weather, and mist that can obscure visibility. The northwest monsoon comes from the beginning of October, characterized by thunderstorms, rain and squalls alternating with calm days with fair weather. The biggest rainfall occur from November to February. From February, the weather becomes unpredictable because of the changing monsoon, before settling again around the end of May. = Currents and water transport = The current strength of the strait vary depending on the monsoon wind. At the peak of either monsoon, the current can run up to 3 miles per hour. When the monsoon is light, \\"there is little or no current\\" and the direction may be subject to the tidal stream. The strait's currents run between the South China Sea to its north and the Java Sea to its south. Since it is relatively shallow, with the depth of or less, the volume transported by the current is relatively small. A 2007‚Äì2008 study by a group of Indonesian and Chinese researchers found that the transport volume averaged 0.5 m3/second (or 0.5 Sv) with a net southward direction (i.e. to the Java Sea). During the northern hemisphere winter, roughly during the northwest monsoon, water flowed southward averaging 2.7 Sv. The flow was reversed during the northern hemisphere summer, roughly during the southwest monsoon, with an average transport of 1.2 Sv.  History  A 1917 nautical chart of the strait, published by the United States Hydrographic Office. It was known to British sailors in the 18th and 19th centuries as the Caramata Passage. The strait was used as a route by the British fleet for its Invasion of Java (1811), sailing from the British base in Malacca to the island of Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies. Initially, the British were unsure of the strait's practicability, and hesitated between taking it or a northeast passage around the north of Borneo and through Makassar Strait. A report by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then a British officer in Malacca, recommended taking the Karimata route, which he considered \\"less dangerous than tedious\\" than the northeast passage during that time of year. Raffles estimated that this journey would take the British fleet between a month and six weeks for \\"the fleet sailing in divisions\\". The British Governor-General of India The Lord Minto decided to take Raffles's suggestion over the objection of some naval officers. The fleet, numbering about 100 vessels and transporting about 11,000 troops, departed Malacca between 11 and 18 June 1811, and reached the coast of Java on 30 July after a smooth journey, exactly six weeks after Minto and Raffles' departure. A 1915 publication by the United States Hydrographic Office commented that despite being much wider, the strait did not have as much traffic as the parallel Bangka or Gaspar Straits. The publication said that the advantage of its breadth was often outweighed by the danger posed by shoals in the strait, as well as its more irregular currents.  Recent events  On 28 December 2014 Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed into the strait after losing contact over the Java Sea when en route from Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia to Singapore. The crash also killed everyone onboard. The 2016 installment of the sailing event Sail Indonesia was held in the strait was dubbed the \\"Sail Karimata Strait 2016\\". Four provinces of Indonesia located on either side of the strait‚ÄîWest Kalimantan, Jambi, Bangka Belitung and Riau Islands hosted the event, culminating in the peak event on 15 October on Datuk Island, North Kayong Regency, West Kalimantan.

Its 2001 census population of 11,410 rose to 12,370 in 2011. Ashby de la Zouch Castle was important in the 15th‚Äì17th centuries. In the 19th century the town's main industries were ribbon manufacture, coal mining, and brickmaking. From 1849 it was served by the Leicester‚ÄìBurton upon Trent line of the Midland Railway. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Shellbrook to the west and Boundary to the north-west. Swadlincote, Burton-upon-Trent, Melbourne and Coalville are within , with Derby due north. Ashby lies at the heart of The National Forest, about south of the Peak District National Park, on the A42 between Tamworth and Nottingham. In 2018, Ashby Market Street was named \\"Best Shopping Experience\\", and in 2019 it made the final of the rising-star category for UK high streets. History Ashby de la Zouch castle The town was known as Ashby in 1086.http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SK3616/ashby-de-la-zouch/ Open Domesday: Ashby-de-la-Zouche This is a word of Anglo-Danish origin, meaning \\"Ash-tree farm\\" or \\"Ash-tree settlement\\". The Norman French name extension dates from the years after the Norman conquest of England, when Ashby became a possession of the La Zouche family during the reign of Henry III. Ashby de la Zouch Castle was built in the 12th century.Pevsner, 1960, page 51 The town and castle came into the possession of the Hastings family in 1464 and William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings enhanced its fortifications from 1473. In the English Civil War, the town was one of the Cavaliers' chief garrisons under the control of Colonel Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough and commander of the North Midlands Army. When the town fell after a long siege in March 1646, it was counted a great relief to the surrounding towns and villages. Many of the buildings in Market Street, the town's main thoroughfare, are timber framed. Most of this structure is hidden by later brick facades. The Bull's Head public house retains its original Elizabethan half-timbering, although most of this was plastered over some years ago and can no longer be seen from the street. A short distance further down Market Street is a shop, currently occupied as a LOROS Charity Shop, which retains its original Elizabethan timbers in full street view. Regency buildings are also standing in this street. Bath Street has a row of Classical-style houses called Rawdon Terrace, dating from the time of the 1820s, when the town was a spa destination. Notable buildings =Churches= Holy Trinity parish church Methodist church Congregational church Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic church St Helen's Church is Ashby's original Anglican parish church. It is a late 15th- century Perpendicular Gothic building. The outer aisles were designed by J. P. St. Aubyn and added in 1878.Pevsner, 1960, page 50 St. Helen's contains notable memorials to various members of the Hastings family and other notables. It also holds a rare 300-year-old finger pillory,Nikolaus Pevsner, Elizabeth Williamson and Geoffrey K. Brandwood which may have been used to punish people misbehaving in church. Holy Trinity Church is a Gothic Revival building designed by H. I. Stevens in the Early English Gothic style and built in 1838‚Äì40. It has galleries supported by iron columns. The chancel was added in 1866 and the ironwork chancel screen in 1891. The Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Lourdes was designed by F. A. Walters and built in 1908‚Äì15 at the expense of the 15th Duke of Norfolk. It is neo-Norman, with three apses and a tower at the southeast corner. The Congregational Church was built in 1825 in a neoclassical style with Tuscan columns.Pevsner, 1960, page 54 The Methodist Church was built in 1867‚Äì68 in a Gothic Revival style. There is also a Christadelphian meeting hall in the town. =Ivanhoe Baths= The water tower at Ashby de la Zouch cemetery, prior to its conversion into a dwelling The Ivanhoe Baths was an 1822 Neo-Grecian building with a Doric fa√ßade long. Unused, it was derelict by 1960, and was demolished in 1962.Nikolaus Pevsner, Elizabeth Williamson and Geoffrey K. Brandwood Kate Noble Mineworkers discovered a copious saline spring when working coal at Moira Colliery, west of the town, in 1805. Here developers built the Moira Baths, with a large hotel nearby for travellers. After a few years, however, it was decided to convey the water to Ashby, where the Ivanhoe Baths were built. The Royal Hotel, originally called the Hastings Hotel, was built in 1826 to accommodate visitors to the growing spa. It has a Doric porte-coch√®re and additional Doric columns in its hall inside. The hotel closed in February 2018. =Water tower= The Grade II-listed, 19th-century water tower, located in the town's cemetery on Moira Road, has been converted into a dwelling. The conversion was controversial since it involved a number of modern additions to the building. =Loudoun Monument= In 1879, Baron Donington, the widowed husband of Edith Rawdon-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun, had the Loudoun monument erected to her memory in Ashby. The octagonal monument by Sir George Gilbert Scott is based on the Eleanor crosses and is a Listed building. It is located at the junction of Bath and South Streets, opposite the Roman Catholic church. Education The local upper school, Ashby School, previously Ashby Grammar School, is a mixed comprehensive school for 14‚Äì18-year-olds. It was founded in 1567. The town formerly had two other endowed boys' schools founded in the 18th century. A local high school, Ivanhoe College, for 11 to 14-year-olds, is named after the historical novel Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott, which he set in the area of the castle. In Scott's novel the town hosts an important archery competition held by Prince John, in which Robin Hood competes and wins. Manor House School was an independent day school in the centre of Ashby for boys and girls aged four to 16. The school was located between St Helen's Church and the ruins of Ashby's historic castle. Pupils travelled to the school from a wide area. The school entered into administration on 13 December 2018. Business In the 19th century Ashby's main industry was leather working. There was also a cotton textile factory and a glue factory. Ashby was surrounded by coalmines but was never a coalmining town itself. By far the largest employer in the town today is United Biscuits, providing about 2,000 jobs at its distribution centre, which stores its products and transports them nationwide, and its KP Snacks factory in Smisby Road. The firm formerly had a larger presence in Ashby. McVitie's biscuit factory on Smisby Road closed in 2004 with the loss of 900 jobs.Annual and Transition Report, Foreign Private Issuer\\", SEC, 06 April 2005. Quote: \\"During 2003, we announced a proposal to close our biscuit factory at Ashby-de-la-Zouch by the end of 2004 to improve our factory utilization and enable us to effectively support growth in our priority brands. We transferred approximately one-third of production to other sites and completed the first phase of the redundancy program...During 2004...[we also completed the closure of our biscuit facility at Ashby-de-la- Zouch.\\" Other employers in Ashby include Tesco, Ashfield Commercial & Medical Services, Timeline Communications, Eduteq Limited and TAC UK Ltd, a firm of energy consultants. Standard Soap Ltd, a significant industrial employer within Ashby-de-la-Zouch since 1928, closed in early 2012, resulting in the loss of 155 jobs. The town has a concentration of high-tech employers. The video game software house Ultimate Play the Game, was based in Ashby. Now called Rare, it has moved to Manor Park near Twycross. The UK government's swine flu help-line centre for England was based at Ashby. Recreation Willesley Park Golf Course is set in rolling countryside, partly in parkland and partly on heathland, covering 230 acres of gentle undulating countryside. The course was opened for play in April 1921. The first hole is played along an avenue of lime trees which once flanked the old coach road from the old Norman castle in the town to the now demolished Willesley Hall. Ashby Hastings Cricket Club was founded before 1831. Its ground, the Bath Grounds in the centre of Ashby, hosts Leicestershire CCC 2nd XI matches each year. The club runs three Saturday League sides, all of which play in the Everard's Leicestershire County Cricket League. The 1st XI play in the Premier Division, the highest level of club cricket available in Leicestershire, the 2nd XI play in Division 4 and the 3rd XI play in Division 8. The club also run a Midweek XI who play in the Premier Division of the Loughborough Cricket Association League and a Sunday XI who play friendly cricket. The club's Junior Section includes sides at Under 15, Under 13, Under 11 and Under 10 age groups. A second club, Ashby Town Cricket Club was formed in 1945. Ashby RFC has its grounds in Nottingham Road. It plays in the League Midland 3 East (North). It also has mini and junior sections for girls and boys from age four, as well as seniors and seconds side and an O2 Touch team for players of all ages and both genders.Club site [www.pitchero.com/clubs/ashbyrugbyfootballclub/ Retrieved 10 July 2016.] The town also has a bridge club (Ashby Bridge Club), and a hockey club (Ashby Hockey Club) A greyhound racing track, was opened on 3 April 1931. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. Racing was held on Tuesday and Saturday evenings and distances included 200, 350, 550 and 525 yards. The date of closure is thought to be around 1935. Transport The town was to be served by Ashby Canal from 1804 but the canal never reached Ashby, as it was constructed only to the town of Moira. Ashby had a station on the Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line of the Midland Railway from 1845. After the canal was abandoned in stages between 1944 and 1966, British Railways withdrew the passenger service and closed Ashby de la Zouch railway station in September 1964. The railway remains open for freight. In the 1990s BR planned to restore passenger services between Leicester and Burton as the second phase of its Ivanhoe Line project. However, after the privatisation of British Rail in 1995, this phase of the project was shelved. In 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£49-million proposal to restore passenger services to the line, which would include reopening a station at Ashby. The restoration of passenger train services remains part of Leicestershire County Council's Structure Plan as a project awaiting funding. The nearest railway station is , away. The fastest train to London in the mornings and evenings is from Tamworth (12 miles from Ashby) to Euston at 1hr 2mins average non-stop at peak hours. A511 Ashby bypass The A50 Leicester to Stoke-on-Trent road and the A453 Birmingham to Nottingham road used to pass through the town centre. The heavy traffic, which previously travelled through the town, has been greatly relieved by the A42 and A511 bypasses, which replace the A453 and A50, respectively. Bus routes provide an hourly direct service to Coalville and Burton-upon-Trent (Arriva Midlands 3, 9/9A & 16). The National Express coach network is available in Leicester, which has a daily direct service to London. East Midlands Airport is north-east of Ashby. It provides flights to and from other parts of the UK and Europe. For International travellers Birmingham Airport is 26 miles away (c. 30 mins) and provides international flights Culture Every May, Ashby holds an arts festival sponsored by the district council. This features local artists, musicians, songwriters, poets, performers, and story tellers. The multiple sites around the town host exhibitions, musical performances, workshops and talks, and the town centre is decorated with flags and an outdoor gallery. Ashby Statutes, a travelling funfair, is held every September. Instituted by Royal Statute, it was originally a hiring fair, where domestic servants and farmworkers would be hired for the year. During the fair in the 21st century, Market Street, the main road through the town (the former A50 trunk road), is closed for nearly a week. The traffic is diverted along narrower roads either side of Market Street. Locals call this event \\"The Statutes\\". A song \\"Ashby de la Zouch (Castle Abbey)\\", written by Al Hoffman, Milton Drake and Jerry Livingston, was recorded by the Merry Macs in 1946 on Decca No. 18811. It includes the lines \\"If you wanna smooch and be happy as a pooch, go to Ashby de la Zouch by the sea.\\" (Ashby-de-la-Zouch is close to the centre of England, almost as far from the sea as is possible.) In April 1946 the American jazz bassist and composer Charles Mingus recorded a tune called \\"Ashby de la Zouch\\" with his band. The title or choice of song could have been an acknowledgement of guitarist Irving Ashby, who took part in the recording. Ashby-de-la-Zouch is twinned with Pithiviers in north-central France.

The parish adjoins the Derbyshire county boundary and the village is only about south of the Derbyshire town of Melbourne. The 2001 Census recorded a parish population (including Isley and Wilson) of 958 people in 404 households.Leicestershire County Council: 2001 Census The parish includes the hamlets of Tonge east of the village and Wilson north of the village on the county boundary. The population at the 2011 census (including Isley cum Langley and Langley Priory) was 1,029 in 450 households. Geography Breedon's limestone hill rising above the village green and war memorial Aerial view, showing church and quarry Breedon is notable for its Carboniferous limestone hill that rises above sea level in a generally low- lying landscape and affords distant views across several counties. A large portion of the hill has been cut away by an active quarry now operated by the Breedon Group. On top of the hill is The Bulwarks Iron Age hill fort, within which is Breedon's historic Church of England parish church. A recent survey found considerable evidence of occupation within the southern part of the hillfort enclosure. Breedon is from East Midlands Airport and from the junction of the A42 road and M1 motorway. The village is from the River Trent, and from Donington Park motor circuit. History Excavation of The Bulwarks in 1946 identified occupation between about the 1st century BC and about 1st century AD. The toponym is derived from the Celtic word bre for hill and the Old English word dun for hill. Hence in its current form the name combines three forms of the word hill. Briudun, an early spelling, has been traced from AD 731. Medieval hagiography manuscripts record four saints buried in Breedon on the Hill. They are Friduricus,Brian C.J. Williams, The Story of St. Mary and St. Hardulph Church: A Cradle of our Faith (The United Benefice of Breedon and Worthington, 2006) donor of the Mercian royal monastery built in Breedon during the seventh century, King Eardwulf of Northumbria, and relatively unknown Anglo-Saxon Saints Beonna of Breedon and Cotta of Breedon.Stowe MS 944, British LibraryThe Oxford Dictionary of Saints, Oxford University Press. Breedon has a circular stone-built village lock-up. It is 18th-century and similar to the one in the nearby Worthington. It was used for detaining local drunks or lost cattle. Breedon Hall is an historic building which was the ancestral home of the Curzon family. In 1874, a branch of the Midland Railway was built through the eastern part of the parish and Tonge and Breedon railway station was built at Tonge. In 1980 British Rail closed the line and later the track was dismantled. The trackbed through the parish is now part of National Cycle Route 6. Breedon Priory Church The Priory Church of St Mary and St Hardulph was originally a monastery founded in about AD 676 on the site of The Bulwarks, an Iron Age hill fort. It was re-founded as an Augustinian priory early in the 12th century. Before becoming a monastery it was a hermitage. In 1498 members of the visiting Battenberg family took mass at the church on a number of occasions. What remains of the priory church includes a large number of Anglo-Saxon sculptures, an ornate family box pew and notable Renaissance church monuments. Amenities Breedon has two pubs: the Holly Bush and the Three Horseshoes. There was a third pub, The Lime Kiln, but this is now a private home. The village has a small primary school and a post office. It did have a butcher's shop, but that closed in 2017. Breedon has a football club, Breedon F.C.

It is usually made of foamed neoprene, and is worn by surfers, divers, windsurfers, canoeists, and others engaged in water sports and other activities in or on water, primarily providing thermal insulation, but also buoyancy and protection from abrasion, ultraviolet exposure and stings from marine organisms. The insulation properties of neoprene foam depend mainly on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. Hugh Bradner, a University of California, Berkeley, physicist invented the modern wetsuit in 1952. Wetsuits became available in the mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed, and later sandwiched, with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later spandex (also known as lycra). Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing, taping and blindstitching, helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing, the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside. Further improvements in the seals at the neck, wrists, ankles and zippers produced a suit known as a \\"semi-dry\\". Different types of wetsuit are made for different uses and for different temperatures. Suits range from a thin (2 mm or less) \\"shortie\\", covering just the torso, to a full 8 mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood. The difference between a wetsuit and a dry suit is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit, while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering, thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness. Wetsuits can give adequate protection in warm to moderately cold waters. Dry suits are typically more expensive and more complex to use, but can be used where protection from lower temperatures or contaminated water is needed. Uses Wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water, or frequently doused with heavy spray, often approaching from near-horizontal directions, where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out. Activities include underwater diving, sailing, sea rescue operations, surfing, river rafting, whitewater kayaking and in some circumstances, endurance swimming.

Unlike triathlons, which allow swimmers to wear wetsuits when the water is below a certain temperature (the standard is at the surface or up to for unofficial events.), most open water swim races either do not permit the use of wetsuits, (usually defined as anything covering the body above the waist or below the knees), or put wetsuit-clad swimmers in a separate category and/or make them ineligible for race awards. This varies by locales and times of the year, where water temperatures are substantially below comfortable. Insulation Semi-dry cuffs use a smooth surface to seal against the skin to reduce flushing. Still water (without currents or convection) conducts heat away from the body by pure thermal diffusion, approximately 20 to 25 times more efficiently than still air. Water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 Wm‚àí1K‚àí1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 Wm‚àí1K‚àí1, so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day. Wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene, a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material (neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important). Nitrogen, like most gases, has very low thermal conductivity compared to water or to solids,Nitrogen has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 Wm‚àí1K‚àí1, the same as air ‚Äì and the small and enclosed nature of the gas bubbles minimizes heat transport through the gas by convection in the same way that cloth fabrics or feathers insulate by reducing convection of enclosed air spaces. The result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction, which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas, thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body (or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit. Uncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054 Wm‚àí1K‚àí1, which produces about twice the heat loss of still air, or one-tenth the loss of water. However at a depth of about of water, the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50%, allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface. A wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed; too loose a fit, particularly at the openings (wrists, ankles, neck and overlaps) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves. Flexible seals at the suit cuffs aid in preventing heat loss in this fashion. The elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes, but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety. Foamed neoprene is very buoyant, helping swimmers to stay afloat, and for this reason divers need to carry extra weight based on the volume of their suit to achieve neutral buoyancy near the surface. However, the suit loses thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depthNon-foamed solid neoprene has a thermal conductivity between 0.15 Wm‚àí1K‚àí1 and 0.45 Wm‚àí1K‚àí1 depending on type, not very different from water ‚Äì Buoyancy is also reduced by compression, and scuba divers can correct this by inflating the buoyancy compensator. = Semi- dry suits = Detail showing zipper attachment, internal flap and cover flap of semi-dry suit Semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with improved seals at wrist, neck and ankles and also usually featuring a waterproof dry-zip. Together, these features greatly reduce the amount of water moving through the suit as the wearer moves in the water. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and is not \\"flushed\\" out by colder water entering from the outside environment, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add significantly to the suit's insulating ability. Any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but this loss is minimised due to the more effective seals. Though more expensive and more difficult to take on and off than a wetsuit (in most cases, a helper will be needed to close the dry-zip, which is usually located across the shoulders), semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits, and in the case of scuba diving, require no additional skills to use. They are usually made from thick Neoprene (typically 6mm or more), which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the Neoprene compress at depth, like a normal wetsuit. Early suits marketed as \\"Semi-dry\\" suits came come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces, made of 'long johns' and a separate 'jacket'. Almost all modern semi-dry suits are one piece suits with, with the zipper usually being a dry-zip across the shoulders on the back, but other arrangements have been used. Semi-dry suits do not usually incorporate boots, and modern designs usually do not incorporate the hood (as creating a secure seal around the face is difficult) so a separate pair of wetsuit boots, hood and gloves as worn, as needed. They are most suitable for use where the water temperature is between . =Heated suits= Electrically heated wetsuits are also available on the market. These suits have special heating panels integrated in the back of the wetsuit. The power for heating comes from batteries also integrated into the wetsuit. Even more versatile is the heated neoprene vest that functions the same as the heated wetsuit but can be worn under any type of wetsuit. Wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water, particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases. Hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution. Flushing with cold water is prevented by the constant outflow of heating water. History =Origins= Woman wearing \\"smoothskin\\" wetsuit with \\"beavertail\\" and twistlock fasteners In 1952, UC Berkeley and subsequent UC San Diego SIO physicist Hugh Bradner, who is considered to be the original inventor and \\"father of the modern wetsuit,\\" had the insight that a thin layer of trapped water could be tolerated between the suit fabric and the skin, so long as insulation was present in the fabric in the form of trapped bubbles. In this case, the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way. In the popular mind, the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation, but Bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric. He initially sent his ideas to Lauriston C. \\"Larry\\" Marshall who was involved in a U.S. Navy/National Research Council Panel on Underwater Swimmers. However, it was Willard Bascom, an engineer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, who suggested neoprene as a feasible material to Bradner. Bradner and Bascom were not overly interested in profiting from their design and were unable to successfully market a version to the public. They attempted to patent their neoprene wetsuit design, but their application was rejected because the design was viewed as too similar to a flight suit. The United States Navy also turned down Bradner's and Bascom's offer to supply its swimmers and frogmen with the new wetsuits due to concerns that the gas in the neoprene component of the suits might make it easier for naval divers to be detected by underwater sonar. The first written documentation of Bradner's invention was in a letter to Marshall, dated June 21, 1951. Jack O'Neill started using closed-cell neoprene foam which was shown to him by his bodysurfing friend, Harry Hind, who knew of it as an insulating material in his laboratory work. After experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams, O'Neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called O'Neill in a San Francisco garage in 1952, later relocating to Santa Cruz, California in 1959 with the motto \\"It's Always Summer on the Inside\\". Bob and Bill Meistrell, from Manhattan Beach, California, also started experimenting with neoprene around 1953. They started a company which would later be named Body Glove. French diving gear manufacturer Georges Beuchat wearing the \\"isothermic\\" sponge-rubber wetsuit he invented in 1953 Neoprene was not the only material used in early wetsuits, particularly in Europe and Australia. The P√™che-Sport \\"isothermic\\" suit invented by Georges Beuchat in 1953 and the UK-made Siebe Gorman Swimsuit were both made out of sponge rubber. The Heinke Dolphin Suit of the same period, also made in England, came in a green male and a white female version, both manufactured from natural rubber lined with stockinet. As early as July 1951, underwater hunters in Australia were experimenting with a natural rubber wetsuit \\"of a 'wrap on' variety, which does not set out to be 100% waterproof (but it is claimed that) the leakage of water through it is so slow that body warmth under it is maintained for hours.\\"\\"COLD WATER SUITS\\", Spearfishing News July 1951, p. 3. By May 1953, the Bondi underwater equipment manufacturer Undersee Products was already distributing this singlet-like design commercially to Australian sporting goods stores, where it was described thus: \\"Made from heavy sheet rubber, the Sealskin suit is most effective when worn over a football jersey. When jersey becomes wet, rubber holds it firmly against body and thus warmth is generated. Water circulation automatically stops and body warmth builds up in moisture-laden jersey. The Seaskin suit provides both underwater insulation and above-water wind protection.\\"\\"In THIS suit you can spearfish all winter\\", Spearfishing News Vol. 3 No. 5 (May 1953), p. 22. Development of suit design Originally, wetsuits were made only with sheets of foam-rubber or neoprene that did not have any backing material. This type of suit required care while pulling it on because the foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin. Stretching and pulling excessively easily caused these suits to be torn open. This was somewhat remedied by thoroughly powdering the suit and the diver's body with talc to help the rubber slide on more easily. Backing materials first arrived in the form of nylon cloth applied to one side of the neoprene. This allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit, but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff, limiting flexibility. A small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck, wrists, and ankles. In 1960, the British Dunlop Sports Company brought out its yellow Aquafort neoprene wetsuit, whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety.Dunlop Sports Company Limited (1960) \\"The Aquafort wetsuit\\", Triton Vol. 5 No. 2 (March-April 1960), p. 3. However, the line was discontinued after a short while and wetsuits reverted to their black uniformity. The colorful wetsuits seen today first arrived in the 1970s when double-backed neoprene was developed. In this material the foam-rubber is sandwiched between two protective fabric outer layers, greatly increasing the tear-resistance. An external layer also meant that decorative colors, logos, and patterns could be made with panels and strips sewn into various shapes. This change from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits. =Improvements in suit assembly= The first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together. In a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons, the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit. The second problem is that the stretching of the foam tended to enlarge the needle holes when the suit was worn. This meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit. And although the sewn edge did hold the two pieces together, it could also act as a perforated tear edge, making the suit easier to tear along the seams when putting it on and taking it off. When nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved, but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams. Seam taping To deal with all these early sewing problems, taping of seams was developed. The tape is a strong nylon cloth with a very thin but solid waterproof rubber backing. The tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a chemical solvent or with a hot rolling heat- sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene. With this technology, the suit could be sewn and then taped, and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes. When colorful double-backed designer suits started appearing, taping moved primarily to the inside of the suit because the tape was usually very wide, jagged, black, and ugly, and was hidden within the suit and out of sight. Many 1960s and 1970s wetsuits were black with visible yellow seam taping. The yellow made the divers more easily seen in dark low-visibility water. To avoid this problem O'Neill fabricators developed a seam-tape which combined a thin nylon layer with a polyester hemming tape. Applied over the interior of the glued & sewn seam, then anneal bonded with a hand held teflon heating iron produced a seam that was both securely sealed and much stronger. Seam gluing Another alternative to sewing was to glue the edges of the suit together. This created a smooth, flat surface that did not necessarily need taping, but unfortunately, raw foam glued to foam is not a strong bond and still prone to tearing. Most early wetsuits were fabricated completely by hand, which could lead to sizing errors in the cutting of the foam sheeting. If the cut edges did not align correctly or the gluing was not done well, there might still be water leakage along the seam. Initially, suits could be found as being sewn only, glued only, taped only, then also sewn and taped, or glued and taped, or perhaps all three. Blindstitch revolution Sometime after nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the blind stitch method was developed. A blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle, which does not go all the way through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing, crosses the glue line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene. This is similar to the overlock stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics. The curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene, and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam. Blindstitch seams also lay flat, butting up the edge of one sheet against another, allowing the material to lay flatter and closer to the skin. For these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together, with other methods now used mainly for decorative or stylistic purposes. =Further advances in suit design= Highly elastic fabrics such as spandex (also known as lycra) have mostly replaced plain nylon backing, since the nylon by itself cannot be stretched and makes the neoprene very stiff. Incorporating Lycra into the backing permits a large amount of stretching that does not damage the suit, and allowed suits to become closer fitting. After the development of double-backed neoprene, singled-backed neoprene still had its uses for various specific purposes. For example, a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg, neck, and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person's body moves. But since the strip is very narrow, it does not drag on the skin of the wearer and thus makes the suit easy to put on and remove. The strip can also be fitted with the smooth side out and folded under to form a seal with a small length of smooth surface against the skin. As wetsuit manufacturers continued to develop suit designs, they found ways that the materials could be further optimized and customized. The O'Neill Animal Skin created in 1974 by then Director of Marketing, E.J. Armstrong, was one of the first designs combining a turtle-neck based on the popular Sealsuit with a flexible lightweight YKK horizontal zipper across the back shoulders similar in concept to the inflatable watertight Supersuit (developed by Jack O'Neill in the late 1960s). The Animal Skin eventually evolved molded rubber patterns bonded onto the exterior of the neoprene sheeting ( a technique E.J. Armstrong perfected for application of the moulded raised rubber Supersuit logo to replace the standard flat decals ). This has been carried on as stylized reinforcing pads of rubber on the knees and elbows to protect the suit from wear, and allows logos to be directly bonded onto raw sheet rubber. Additionally, the Animal Skin's looser fit allowed for the use of a supplemental vest in extreme conditions. In the early 1970s Gul Wetsuits pioneered the one-piece wetsuit named as the steamer. Its name was given because of the steam given off from the suit once taken off allowing heat and water held inside to escape. One-piece wetsuits are still sometimes referred to as 'Steamers'. In recent years, manufacturers have experimented by combining various materials with neoprene for additional warmth or flexibility of their suits. These include, but are not limited to, spandex, and wool. Precision computer-controlled cutting and assembly methods, such as water-jet cutting, have allowed ever greater levels of seam precision, permitting designers to use many small individual strips of different colors while still keeping the suit free of bulging and ripples from improper cutting and sewing. Further innovations in CAD (Computer Aided Design) technology allow precision cutting for custom-fit wetsuits. =Return of single-backed neoprene= As wetsuits continued to evolve, their use was explored in other sports such as open-water swimming and triathlons. Although double-backed neoprene is strong, the cloth surface is relatively rough and creates a large amount of drag in the water, slowing down the swimmer. A single-backed suit has a smoother exterior surface which causes less drag. With the advances of elastic Lycra backings and blindstitching, single-backed neoprene suits could be made that outperformed the early versions from the 1970s. Other developments in single- backed wetsuits include the suits designed for free-diving and spearfishing. Single lined neoprene is more flexible than double lined. To achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit, they are unlined inside, and the slightly porous raw surface of the neoprene adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit. The lined outer surface may be printed with camouflage patterns for spearfishing and is more resistant to damage while in use. Some triathlon wetsuits go further, and use rubber-molding and texturing methods to roughen up the surface of the suit on the forearms, to increase forward drag and help pull the swimmer forwards through the water. Extremely thin 1 mm neoprene is also often used in the under-arm area, to decrease stretch resistance and reduce strain on the swimmer when they extend their arms out over their head. Wetsuits used for caving are often single- backed with a textured surface known as \\"sharkskin\\" which is a thin layer where the neoprene is less expanded. This makes it more abrasion resistant for squeezing between rocks and doesn't get torn in the way that fabric does. Another reason to eliminate the external textile backing is to reduce water retention which can increase evaporative cooling and wind chill in suits used mainly out of the water. Types Hooded tunic with cargo pockets Different shapes of wetsuit are available, in order of coverage: * A sleeveless vest, covering only the torso, provides minimal coverage. Some include an attached hood. These are not usually intended to be worn alone, but as an extra layer over or under a longer wetsuit. * A hooded tunic, covering the torso and head, with short legs and either short or no sleeves, is generally intended to be worn over a full suit, and has a zip closure. It may be fitted with pockets for transporting accessories. * A jacket covers the torso and arms, with little to no coverage for the legs. Some jackets have short legs like a shorty, others feature leg holes similar to a woman's swimsuit. A third style, the beavertail or bodysuit, has a flap which passes through the crotch and attaches at the front with clips, toggles or velcro fasteners. It is worn with (over) or without a long john or trousers. A jacket may include an integral hood, and may have a full or partial front zipper. * A spring suit covers the torso and has short or long sleeves and short legs. * Trousers cover the lower torso and legs. * A short john, shorty covers the torso and legs to the knee only; does not have sleeves and is a short legged version of the long john. * A long john, johnny, johnny suit, or farmer john/jane (depending on the gender the suit is designed for) covers the torso and legs only; it resembles a bib overall, hence the nickname. * A full suit or steamer covers the torso and the full length of the arms and legs. Some versions come with sleeves the length of a standard t-shirt and known as a short-sleeved steamer. Some suits are arranged in two parts; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions. Typically, two-piece cold water wetsuits have 10 to 14 mm of material around the torso and 5 to 7 mm for the limbs. =Thickness= Wetsuits are available in different thicknesses depending on the conditions for which they are intended. The thicker the suit, the warmer it will keep the wearer, but the more it will restrict movement. Because wetsuits offer significant protection from jellyfish, coral, sunburn and other hazards, many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation (often called a \\"bodysuit\\") even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments. A thick suit will restrict mobility, and as the thickness is increased the suit may become impractical, depending on the application. This is one reason why dry suits may be preferable for some applications. A wetsuit is normally specified in terms of its thickness and style. For instance, a wetsuit with a torso thickness of 5 mm and a limb thickness of 3 mm will be described as a \\"5/3\\". With new technologies the neoprene is getting more flexible. Modern 4/3 wetsuits, for instance, may feel as flexible as a 3/2 of only a few years ago. Some suits have extra layers added for key areas such as the lower back. Improved flexibility may come at the cost of greater compressibility, which reduces insulation at depth, but this is only important for diving. =Surface finish= Foam neoprene used for wetsuits is always closed cell, in that the gas bubbles are mostly not connected to each other inside the neoprene. This is necessary to prevent water absorption, and the gas bubbles do most of the insulation. Thick sheets of neoprene are foamed inside a mould, and the surfaces in contact with the mould take on the inverse texture of the mould surfaces. In the early days of wetsuits this was often a diamond pattern or similar, but can also be slick and smooth for low drag and quick drying. The cut surfaces of the foam have a slightly porous mat finish as the cutting process passes through a large number of bubbles, leaving what is called an open cell surface finish, but the bulk of the foam remains closed cell. The open cell finish is the most stretchy and the least tear resistant. It is relatively form fitting and comfortable on the skin, but the porosity encourages bacterial growth if not well washed after use, and the foam surface does not slide freely against skin. The cut surfaces are usually bonded to a nylon knit fabric, which provides much greater tear resistance, at the expense of some loss of flexibility. This fabric can be bonded to one or both surfaces in various combinations of weight and colour, and can be thin and relatively smooth and fragile, or thicker and stronger and less stretchy. Fabric lined on one side only is more flexible than double lined. A specialized kind of wetsuit, with a very smooth (and somewhat delicate) outer surface known as smoothskin, which is the original outer surface of the foamed neoprene block from which the sheets are cut, is used for long-distance swimming, triathlon competitive apnoea and bluewater spearfishing. These are designed to maximize the mobility of the limbs while providing both warmth and buoyancy, but the surface is delicate and easily damaged. The slick surface also dries quickly and is least affected by wind chill when out of the water. Both smoothskin and fabric lined surfaces can be printed to produce colour patterns such as camouflage designs, which may give spearfishermen and combat divers an advantage. =Closures= Zippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles, but they also provide leakage points for water. Jackets may have a full or partial front zipper, or none at all. Full body suits may have a vertical back zipper, a cross-shoulder zipper or a vertical front zipper. Each of these arrangements has some advantages and some disadvantages: *The front zipper is easy to operate, but the suit may be difficult to remove from the shoulders without assistance, and the zip is uncomfortable for lying on a surfboard. It is relatively inflexible and placed over a part of the body where a lot of flexibility is desirable. The top of the closure will leak to some extent. The top end of the zip may be easily opened for comfort when the wearer is warm, but the zip may also press into the throat, which can be uncomfortable. *Cross shoulder zipper can be made relatively watertight as it has no free ends, and is therefore used in semi-dry wetsuits. It is difficult to operate for the wearer and relatively highly stressed at the shoulders due to arm movement. The zip is also relatively vulnerable to damage from diving harnesses. *Cross chest zipper has similar advantages to cross shoulder, but is easy to reach. *Vertical back zippers are possibly the most common arrangement as they can be operated with a lanyard. They are relatively comfortable for most applications, the suit is easy to remove, and they place the zipper directly over the spine, which though flexible in bending, does not change much in length. The top of the closure will leak to some extent. =Sizing and fit= Wetsuits that fit too tightly can cause difficulty breathing or even acute cardiac failure, and a loose fit allows considerable flushing which reduces effectiveness of insulation, so a proper fit is important. The quality of fit is most important for diving as this is where the thickest suits are used and the heat loss is potentially greatest. A diving wetsuit should touch the skin over as much of the body that it covers as comfortably possible, both when the wearer is relaxed and when exercising. This is difficult to achieve and the details of style and cut can affect the quality of fit. Gaps where the suit does not touch the skin will vary in volume as the diver moves and this is a major cause of flushing. Wetsuits are made in several standard adult sizes and for children. Custom fitted suits are produced by many manufacturers to provide a better fit for people for whom a well fitting off-the shelf suit is not available. Accessories Hard soled wetsuit boots with zip fasteners Usually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet, hands or head, and the diver must wear separate neoprene boots, gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection. Other accessories to the basic suit include pockets for holding small items and equipment, and knee-pads, to protect the knee area from abrasion and tearing, usually used by working divers. Suits may have abrasion protection pads in other areas depending on the application. =Hoods= Using hoods: in the thermal balance of the human body, the heat loss over the head is at least 20% of the whole balance. Thus, for the sake of thermal protection of the diver, wearing a well-fitting hood is useful, even at fairly moderate water temperatures. Hoods have been reported to cause claustrophobia in a minority of users, sometimes due to poor fit. The hood should not fit too tightly round the neck. Flushing in the neck area can be reduced by using a hood attached to the top part of the suit, or by having sufficient overlap between the hood and the top part of the suit to constrain flow between the two parts. This can be achieved by tucking a circular flap at the base of the neck of the hood under the top of the suit before closing the zip, or by having a high neck on the suit. =Boots= A pair of zippered wetsuit boots. Note the reinforced sole for protection. Wetsuit boots are worn for various purposes, and may be worn with or without a wetsuit. Thermal protection In many water sports such as scuba diving, surfing, kayaking, windsurfing, sailing and even fishing, bootees may be worn to keep the feet warm in the same way that a wetsuit would. Insulation is proportional to thickness and thus to how cold the water which the user can tolerate; it may be above or below the standard of 5‚Äì6 mm of neoprene. In warmer climates where the thermal qualities of the bootee are not so important, a bootee with a thickness of 2‚Äì3.5 mm is common. The leg of the bootee may have a zipper down one side or may be tightened with a velcro strap. Where boots are worn with a wetsuit they are usually tucked under the leg of the suit for streamlining, to help hold the zip closed, and to keep foreign objects out. Foot protection A bootee usually has a reinforced sole for walking. Typically, this is a solid rubber compound that is thicker and tougher than the neoprene used for the upper part of the bootee but is still flexible. The reinforced sole provides the wearer with some protection and grip when walking across shingle, coral and other rough surfaces. =For scuba diving= For scuba diving the sole of the bootee should not be so thick that the diver cannot get a fin on over it. Divers wearing bootees use fins with a foot part larger than needed with bare feet. Divers in warm water who do not wear a diving suit sometimes wear bootees so they can wear bigger fins. Diving bootees are typically intended for wear with open-heeled fins, held on by a strap, and usually do not fit into full-footed fins. Neoprene socks may be used with full-footed fins, either to prevent chafing and blisters, or for warmth. For surfing For surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing and similar sports, bootees are typically worn where the weather is so cold that the surfer would lose some degree of functionality in the feet. The bootee should not restrict the ability of a surfer to grip the board with the toes in the desired manner. Split-toe bootees allow for some improvement in this functionality. Reef walkers are small bootees that are only as high as the ankle and generally only 2 to 3.5mm thick. They are designed to allow surfers to get out to waves that break at coral reefs or at rocky beaches. For kayaking Several styles of wetsuit boots are commonly used for kayaking. Short-cut boots are frequently used in warmer conditions where the boots help give grip and foot protection while launching and portaging. In cold conditions longer wetsuit boots may be used with a drysuit where they are worn over the rubber drysuit socks. =Gloves= Neoprene wetsuit gloves Wetsuit gloves are worn to keep the hands warm and to protect the skin while working. They are available in a range of thicknesses. Thicker gloves reduce manual dexterity and limit feel. Wetsuit gloves are also commonly worn with dry suits. Some divers cut the fingertips of the gloves off on the fingers most used for delicate work like operating the controls on a camera housing. If this is done, the fingertips are exposed to cold and possible injury, so thin work-gloves may be worn under the insulating gloves. For cold water use, thicker mittens with a single space for the middle, ring and fifth fingers are available and can provide more warmth at the cost of reducing dexterity. Buoyancy Measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression shows that about 30% of the volume, and therefore 30% of surface buoyancy, is lost in about the first 10 m, another 30% by about 60 m, and the volume appears to stabilise at about 65% loss by about 100 m. The total buoyancy loss of a wetsuit is proportional to the initial uncompressed volume. An average person has a surface area of about 2 m2, so the uncompressed volume of a full one piece 6 mm thick wetsuit will be in the order of 1.75 x 0.006 = 0.0105 m3, or roughly 10 litres. The mass will depend on the specific formulation of the foam, but will probably be in the order of 4 kg, for a net buoyancy of about 6 kg at the surface. Depending on the overall buoyancy of the diver, this will generally require 6 kg of additional weight to bring the diver to neutral buoyancy to allow reasonably easy descent The volume lost at 10 m is about 3litres, or 3 kg of buoyancy, rising to about 6 kg buoyancy lost at about 60 m. This could nearly double for a large person wearing a farmer-john and jacket for cold water. This loss of buoyancy must be balanced by inflating the buoyancy compensator to maintain neutral buoyancy at depth.

With Nick Lowe on bass and vocals, keyboardist Bob Andrews and drummer Billy Rankin, the band evolved from the 1960s pop band Kippington Lodge. They were later augmented by Ian Gomm on guitar and vocals. Formation Nick Lowe (bass, guitars, vocals) and Brinsley Schwarz (guitar, piano, vocals) originally met at Woodbridge School where they played in school bands with Barry Landeman (keyboards, vocals) and Phil Hall (guitar). In 1964, whilst still at school, they toured RAF bases in Germany as \\"Sounds 4+1\\". On leaving school, Schwarz formed \\"Three's A Crowd\\" with Pete Whale (drums) and Dave Cottam (bass). Landeman joined in 1967 and they renamed themselves \\"Kippington Lodge\\". Their first two singles, produced by Mark Wirtz, in a close-harmony pop style, both flopped. Cottam left, and Schwarz invited Lowe to join. Landeman then left to join Vanity Fare, Bob Andrews joined on keyboards, and finally, Whale was replaced by Billy Rankin on drums. Although the next three singles also failed, they had a residency as support band at The Marquee. The band's style was changing from pop into \\"a folk-rock band with psychedelic pretentions\\".[ Allmusic Biography of Brinsley Schwarz by Stephen Thomas Erlewine] Retrieved 19 March 2009 In 1969 they renamed the band after their guitarist, and performed their new music under this name, whilst continuing to play pop as Kippington Lodge. One of the band's first managers, John Schofield, was at the time the lover of Hattie Jacques (who would occasionally make bacon sandwiches for the band members when they visited Schofield's home). In the early part of their career the band shared a communal home in a large old house in Beaconsfield and these premises were used as a rehearsal space by The Band, who came to the UK as part of the Warner Brothers tour. The Band borrowed Brinsley Schwarz's instruments to rehearse.\\"Nick Lowe, interviewed by Mark Ellen\\", Word Podcast 168: Nick Lowe, posted 15 April 2011 Publicity campaign Brinsley Schwarz signed a contract with manager Dave Robinson, of Famepushers, who devised a plan to earn the band extensive publicity. They were to open for Van Morrison and Quicksilver Messenger Service at the Fillmore East in New York City, on 3 and 4 April 1970. Robinson would fly a plane full of British journalists to the show, so they could review it, along with the winners of a Melody Maker competition, arranged in order to get pre-publicity. Though the band had planned on leaving a few days early, so they could rehearse, visa problems prevented this, so they went to Canada and entered the US in a light aircraft. They arrived in New York shortly before they were due on stage, and had to use hired equipment with which they were unfamiliar. The journalists were due the following day, but their plane was delayed for four hours, so they had free use of the bar, and eventually arrived at the show either drunk or hung over. The show did not go over well, and the band received a flood of negative reviews over the following weeks, including bad reviews of their first album, Brinsley Schwarz, which was released shortly after their return to the United Kingdom. This incident became known as the Brinsley Schwarz Hype. Casey Kasem's version of this story, in a September 1979 episode of American Top Forty, implied that the presence of the critics was a surprise to the band. Pub-rock Later in 1970, Brinsley Schwarz released their second album, Despite It All, which had a definite country sound to it. They were heavily influenced by Eggs over Easy, who they first saw perform at 'The Tally Ho' in Kentish Town, and admired their laid-back style and extensive repertoire. In 1971, guitarist Ian Gomm joined the band, and they recorded their third album Silver Pistol. In response to \\"the hype\\", they became anti-commercial and spent much of 1971 rehearsing, although they toured on the Downhome Rhythm Kings package with Help Yourself & Ernie Graham (ex Eire Apparent), who were all managed by Dave Robinson. This led to them backing Ernie Graham on his eponymous solo album. Brinsley Schwarz played at the second Glastonbury Festival (1971), and one track, \\"Love Song\\", appeared on the subsequent Glastonbury Fayre album. Their solid live performances soon garnered the band a large fanbase in London, and, along with bands like Eggs over Easy, Brinsley Schwarz were soon dubbed \\"pub rock\\" by rock journalists. They sounded rather like The Band, with Schwarz's guitar work influenced greatly by Robbie Robertson's. In February 1972 they supported Hawkwind and Man at the Greasy Truckers Party, which was issued as a double album, and brought critical acclaim. Unfortunately, for a band known for its live performances, this was their only live album. 1972's ironic take on country-rock, Nervous on the Road, also received excellent reviews. It did not reach the charts, but earned them a slot opening for Paul McCartney's Wings 1973 UK Tour. The same year, they also acted as Frankie Miller's band for his debut album Once in a Blue Moon. Their fifth studio album Please Don't Ever Change, issued in 1973, was less well received by the critics, and achieved poor sales. However during this time they made successful appearances on The Old Grey Whistle Test with Lowe on guitar and vocals, Gomm on bass and Schwarz on piano alongside Andrews on keyboard and recorded sessions for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. In 1974 they arranged for Dave Edmunds to produce their sixth album The New Favourites of... Brinsley Schwarz which was more polished, and again received good reviews. This association also led to their touring as Dave Edmunds' backing band, appearing on the live tracks of his Subtle as a Flying Mallet album. In addition to the albums, Brinsley Schwarz also issued a series of singles under their own name, and various pseudonyms, such as \\"The Hitters\\", \\"The Knees\\", \\"Limelight\\" and \\"The Brinsleys\\" but these all failed. They recorded a final album, It's All Over Now, in 1974 but this was not released at the time. They finally disbanded in 1975. Subsequent careers Brinsley Schwarz and Bob Andrews joined Graham Parker & the Rumour, which functioned as a unit through 1981. Later Andrews moved to New Orleans. Schwarz, meanwhile, continued playing as a sideman for various artists through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Schwarz joined a reunited Ducks Deluxe in 2009, then both Schwarz and Andrews joined a reunited Rumour in 2012. Billy Rankin joined Terraplane and then Big Jim Sullivan's Tiger. He retired from the music industry in 1977, though he was persuaded to play with a reunited Ducks Deluxe for their 30th anniversary reunion show in 2007. Though Ducks Deluxe continues as a touring and recording act, Rankin is not involved with them. Nick Lowe and Ian Gomm both began solo careers, achieving moderate mainstream success. Lowe's 1978 album Jesus of Cool received considerable critical acclaim and reached number 22 in the UK albums chart. It included the track \\"I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass\\", which reached number 7 in the UK singles chart. The album also included Bob Andrews on keyboard and Dave Edmunds on guitar. Lowe also co-wrote Dr. Feelgood's top ten hit \\"Milk and Alcohol\\", which reached number 9 in 1979. Lowe's 1979 single and biggest worldwide hit \\"Cruel to Be Kind\\" was co-written with Gomm and originally recorded by Brinsley Schwarz for their unreleased final album. This version was included on the 2008 30th anniversary edition of the Jesus of Cool album. In 1979 Gomm had a hit with \\"Hold On\\", which reached number 18 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. The original version of \\"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\\", which written by Lowe and later would become a hit for Elvis Costello, was released by the band in 1974 on their album The New Favourites of... Brinsley Schwarz. Costello knew of the song as both a fan and part-time roadie for the band, which is where he and Lowe first met.

These detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times or 108 (i.e., 160 dB)Decibels are power ratios. Power is proportional to I2 (current squared). Thus a current gain of 108 produces a power gain of 1016, or 160 dB, in multiple dynode stages, enabling (for example) individual photons to be detected when the incident flux of light is low. Dynodes inside a photomultiplier tube The combination of high gain, low noise, high frequency response or, equivalently, ultra-fast response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in low light level spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear and particle physics, astronomy, medical diagnostics including blood tests, medical imaging, motion picture film scanning (telecine), radar jamming, and high-end image scanners known as drum scanners. Elements of photomultiplier technology, when integrated differently, are the basis of night vision devices. Research that analyzes light scattering, such as the study of polymers in solution, often uses a laser and a PMT to collect the scattered light data. Semiconductor devices, particularly avalanche photodiodes, are alternatives to photomultipliers; however, photomultipliers are uniquely well-suited for applications requiring low-noise, high- sensitivity detection of light that is imperfectly collimated. Structure and operating principles Fig.1: Schematic of a photomultiplier tube coupled to a scintillator. This arrangement is for detection of gamma rays. Fig. 2: Typical photomultiplier voltage divider circuit using negative high voltage. Photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing (using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum tubes), containing a photocathode, several dynodes, and an anode. Incident photons strike the photocathode material, which is usually a thin vapor- deposited conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device. Electrons are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier, where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission. The electron multiplier consists of a number of electrodes called dynodes. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ‚âà100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3 eV for \\"blue\\" photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.) The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ‚âà100 eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially- increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 512 ‚âà 108 electrons. This last stage is called the anode. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ‚âà50 nanoseconds earlier. The necessary distribution of voltage along the series of dynodes is created by a voltage divider chain, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the example, the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000 V, while the anode is very close to ground potential. The capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube. Many variations of design are used in practice; the design shown is merely illustrative. There are two common photomultiplier orientations, the head-on or end-on (transmission mode) design, as shown above, where light enters the flat, circular top of the tube and passes the photocathode, and the side-on design (reflection mode), where light enters at a particular spot on the side of the tube, and impacts on an opaque photocathode. The side-on design is used, for instance, in the type 931, the first mass-produced PMT. Besides the different photocathode materials, performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through, and by the arrangement of the dynodes. Many photomultiplier models are available having various combinations of these, and other, design variables. The manufacturers manuals provide the information needed to choose an appropriate design for a particular application. History The invention of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements, the separate discoveries of the photoelectric effect and of secondary emission. =Photoelectric effect= The first demonstration of the photoelectric effect was carried out in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz using ultraviolet light. Significant for practical applications, Elster and Geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using visible light striking alkali metals (potassium and sodium). The addition of caesium, another alkali metal, has permitted the range of sensitive wavelengths to be extended towards longer wavelengths in the red portion of the visible spectrum. Historically, the photoelectric effect is associated with Albert Einstein, who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905, an accomplishment for which Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize. It is worthwhile to note that Heinrich Hertz, working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of quanta, for the first time. =Secondary emission= The phenomenon of secondary emission (the ability of electrons in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode) was, at first, limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices (which lacked photosensitivity). In 1899 the effect was first reported by Villard. In 1902, Austin and Starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted a larger number of electrons than were incident.H. Bruining, Physics and applications of secondary electron emission, (McGraw- Hill Book Co., Inc.; 1954). The application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after World War I by Westinghouse scientist Joseph Slepian in a 1919 patent.J. Slepian, Westinghouse Electric, \\"Hot Cathode Tube\\" , Issued April 3, 1923 (Filed 1919) The race towards a practical electronic television camera The ingredients for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as the pace of vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was the need for a practical television camera technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera (the iconoscope). Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. Photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes, such as the iconoscope and (later) the orthicon, to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of photoemission (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with secondary emission, both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical photomultiplier. First photomultiplier, single-stage (early 1934) The first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an RCA group based in Harrison, NJ. Harley Iams and Bernard Salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain. These accomplishments were finalized prior to June 1934 as detailed in the manuscript submitted to Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers (Proc. IRE). The device consisted of a semi-cylindrical photocathode, a secondary emitter mounted on the axis, and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter. The tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10 kHz. Magnetic photomultipliers (mid 1934‚Äì1937) Higher gains were sought than those available from the early single-stage photomultipliers. However, it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process, regardless of acceleration voltage. Thus, any single-stage photomultiplier is limited in gain. At the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 (very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes). For this reason, multiple-stage photomultipliers, in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages, were an important goal. The challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to impinge on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode. Initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons' trajectories. Such a scheme had earlier been conceived by inventor J. Slepian by 1919 (see above). Accordingly, leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultiplers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages. In the USSR, RCA-manufactured radio equipment was introduced on a large scale by Joseph Stalin to construct broadcast networks, and the newly formed All-Union Scientific Research Institute for Television was gearing up a research program in vacuum tubes that was advanced for its time and place. Numerous visits were made by RCA scientific personnel to the USSR in the 1930s, prior to the Cold War, to instruct the Soviet customers on the capabilities of RCA equipment and to investigate customer needs.A.B. Magoun Adding Sight to Sound in Stalin‚Äôs Russia: RCA and the Transfer of Television Technology to the Soviet Union , Society for the History of Technology (SHOT), Amsterdam (2004) During one of these visits, in September 1934, RCA's Vladimir Zworykin was shown the first multiple-dynode photomultiplier, or photoelectron multiplier. This pioneering device was proposed by Leonid A. Kubetsky in 1930 which he subsequently built in 1934. The device achieved gains of 1000x or more when demonstrated in June 1934. The work was submitted for print publication only two years later, in July 1936 as emphasized in a recent 2006 publication of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), which terms it \\"Kubetsky's Tube.\\" The Soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the Ag-O-Cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by General Electric in the 1920s. By October 1935, Vladimir Zworykin, George Ashmun Morton, and Louis Malter of RCA in Camden, NJ submitted their manuscript describing the first comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of a multiple dynode tube ‚Äî the device later called a photomultiplier ‚Äî to Proc. IRE. The RCA prototype photomultipliers also used an Ag-O-Cs (silver oxide-caesium) photocathode. They exhibited a peak quantum efficiency of 0.4% at 800 nm. Electrostatic photomultipliers (1937‚Äìpresent) Whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle, electrostatic photomultipliers (with no magnetic field) were demonstrated by Jan Rajchman of RCA Laboratories in Princeton, NJ in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers. The first mass-produced photomultiplier, the Type 931, was of this design and is still commercially produced today.J. Rajchman and E.W. Pike, RCA Technical Report TR-362, \\"Electrostatic Focusing in Secondary Emission Multipliers,\\" September 9, 1937 Improved photocathodes Also in 1936, a much improved photocathode, Cs3Sb (caesium-antimony), was reported by P. G√∂rlich. The caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12% at 400 nm, and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by RCA (i.e., the 931-type) both as a photocathode and as a secondary-emitting material for the dynodes. Different photocathodes provided differing spectral responses. =Spectral response of photocathodes= In the early 1940s, the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council), an industry committee on standardization, developed a system of designating spectral responses.\\"Relative spectral response data for photosensitive devices (\\"S\\" curves),\\" JEDEC Publication No. 50, Electronic Industries Association, Engineering Department, 2001 I Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006 (1964) The philosophy included the idea that the product's user need only be concerned about the response of the device rather than how the device may be fabricated. Various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned \\"S-numbers\\" (spectral numbers) ranging from S-1 through S-40, which are still in use today. For example, S-11 uses the caesium-antimony photocathode with a lime glass window, S-13 uses the same photocathode with a fused silica window, and S-25 uses a so-called \\"multialkali\\" photocathode (Na-K-Sb-Cs, or sodium-potassium-antimony-caesium) that provides extended response in the red portion of the visible light spectrum. No suitable photoemissive surfaces have yet been reported to detect wavelengths longer than approximately 1700 nanometers, which can be approached by a special (InP/InGaAs(Cs)) photocathode. p. 34, Table 4-1: Typical Spectral Response Characteristics, Transmission Mode Photocathodes =RCA Corporation= For decades, RCA was responsible for performing the most important work in developing and refining photomultipliers. RCA was also largely responsible for the commercialization of photomultiplers. The company compiled and published an authoritative and widely used Photomultiplier Handbook. RCA provided printed copies free upon request. The handbook, which continues to be made available online at no cost by the successors to RCA, is considered to be an essential reference. Following a corporate break-up in the late 1980s involving the acquisition of RCA by General Electric and disposition of the divisions of RCA to numerous third parties, RCA's photomultiplier business became an independent company. =Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility= The Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility was opened by the U.S. Navy in 1942 and operated by RCA for the manufacture of radio and microwave tubes. Following World War II, the naval facility was acquired by RCA. RCA Lancaster, as it became known, was the base for the development and the production of commercial television products. In subsequent years other products were added, such as \\"cathode-ray\\" tubes, photomultiplier tubes, motion-sensing light control switches, and closed-circuit television systems. =Burle Industries= Burle Industries, as a successor to the RCA Corporation, carried the RCA photomultiplier business forward after 1986, based in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility. The 1986 acquisition of RCA by General Electric resulted in the divestiture of the RCA Lancaster New Products Division. Hence, 45 years after being founded by the U.S. Navy, its management team, led by Erich Burlefinger, purchased the division and in 1987 founded Burle Industries. In 2005, after eighteen years as an independent enterprise, Burle Industries and a key subsidiary were acquired by Photonis, a European holding company Photonis Group. Following the acquisition, Photonis was composed of Photonis Netherlands, Photonis France, Photonis USA, and Burle Industries. Photonis USA operates the former Galileo Corporation Scientific Detector Products Group (Sturbridge, Massachusetts), which had been purchased by Burle Industries in 1999. The group is known for microchannel plate detector (MCP) electron multipliers‚Äîan integrated micro-vacuum tube version of photomultipliers. MCPs are used for imaging and scientific applications, including night vision devices. On 9 March 2009, Photonis announced that it would cease all production of photomultipliers at both the Lancaster, Pennsylvania and the Brive, France plants.PHOTONIS will stop its Photomultiplier activity =Hamamatsu= The Japan-based company Hamamatsu Photonics (also known as Hamamatsu) has emerged since the 1950s as a leader in the photomultiplier industry. Hamamatsu, in the tradition of RCA, has published its own handbook, which is available without cost on the company's website. Hamamatsu uses different designations for particular photocathode formulations and introduces modifications to these designations based on Hamamatsu's proprietary research and development. =Photocathode materials= The photocathodes can be made of a variety of materials, with different properties. Typically the materials have low work function and are therefore prone to thermionic emission, causing noise and dark current, especially the materials sensitive in infrared; cooling the photocathode lowers this thermal noise. The most common photocathode materials arePhotomultiplier Tubes. Construction and Operating Characteristics. Connections to External Circuits, Hamamatsu Ag-O-Cs (also called S1) transmission-mode, sensitive from 300‚Äì1200 nm. High dark current; used mainly in near-infrared, with the photocathode cooled; GaAs:Cs, caesium-activated gallium arsenide, flat response from 300 to 850 nm, fading towards ultraviolet and to 930 nm; InGaAs:Cs, caesium-activated indium gallium arsenide, higher infrared sensitivity than GaAs:Cs, between 900‚Äì1000 nm much higher signal-to-noise ratio than Ag-O-Cs; Sb-Cs, (also called S11) caesium-activated antimony, used for reflective mode photocathodes; response range from ultraviolet to visible, widely used; bialkali (Sb-K-Cs, Sb-Rb-Cs), caesium-activated antimony-rubidium or antimony- potassium alloy, similar to Sb:Cs, with higher sensitivity and lower noise. can be used for transmission-mode; favorable response to a NaI:Tl scintillator flashes makes them widely used in gamma spectroscopy and radiation detection; high-temperature bialkali (Na-K-Sb), can operate up to 175 ¬∞C, used in well logging, low dark current at room temperature; multialkali (Na-K-Sb-Cs), (also called S20), wide spectral response from ultraviolet to near-infrared, special cathode processing can extend range to 930 nm, used in broadband spectrophotometers; solar-blind (Cs-Te, Cs-I), sensitive to vacuum-UV and ultraviolet, insensitive to visible light and infrared (Cs-Te has cutoff at 320 nm, Cs-I at 200 nm). =Window materials= The windows of the photomultipliers act as wavelength filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care has to be taken for uncommon wavelengths. Borosilicate glass is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300 nm. High borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm. Glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope. Ultraviolet glass transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185 nm. Used in spectroscopy. Synthetic silica transmits down to 160 nm, absorbs less UV than fused silica. Different thermal expansion than kovar (and than borosilicate glass that's expansion-matched to kovar), a graded seal needed between the window and the rest of the tube. The seal is vulnerable to mechanical shocks. Magnesium fluoride transmits ultraviolet down to 115 nm. Hygroscopic, though less than other alkali halides usable for UV windows. Usage considerations Photomultiplier tubes typically utilize 1000 to 2000 volts to accelerate electrons within the chain of dynodes. (See Figure near top of article.) The most negative voltage is connected to the cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the positive terminal grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted \\"dark current\\" pulses that may affect the operation. Voltages are distributed to the dynodes by a resistive voltage divider, although variations such as active designs (with transistors or diodes) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or rise time, can be selected to suit varying applications. Some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the anode voltage to control the gain of the system. While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be shielded from ambient light to prevent their destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. Another option is to add overcurrent protection in the external circuit, so that when the measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced. If used in a location with strong magnetic fields, which can curve electron paths, steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain, photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or mu-metal. This magnetic shield is often maintained at cathode potential. When this is the case, the external shield must also be electrically insulated because of the high voltage on it. Photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields. Applications Photomultipliers were the first electric eye devices, being used to measure interruptions in beams of light. Photomultipliers are used in conjunction with scintillators to detect Ionizing radiation by means of hand held and fixed radiation protection instruments, and particle radiation in physics experiments. Photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as compound semiconductors and quantum dots. Photomultipliers are used as the detector in many spectrophotometers. This allows an instrument design that escapes the thermal noise limit on sensitivity, and which can therefore substantially increase the dynamic range of the instrument. Photomultipliers are used in numerous medical equipment designs. For example, blood analysis devices used by clinical medical laboratories, such as flow cytometers, utilize photomultipliers to determine the relative concentration of various components in blood samples, in combination with optical filters and incandescent lamps. An array of photomultipliers is used in a gamma camera. Photomultipliers are typically used as the detectors in flying-spot scanners. =High-sensitivity applications= After 50 years, during which solid-state electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the photomultiplier remains a unique and important optoelectronic component. Perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect current source, owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no Johnson noise associated with photomultiplier signal currents, even though they are greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 100 dB) or more. The photocurrent still contains shot noise. Photomultiplier-amplified photocurrents can be electronically amplified by a high-input-impedance electronic amplifier (in the signal path subsequent to the photomultiplier), thus producing appreciable voltages even for nearly infinitesimally small photon fluxes. Photomultipliers offer the best possible opportunity to exceed the Johnson noise for many configurations. The aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that, while small, nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons. For smaller photon fluxes, the photomultiplier can be operated in photon-counting, or Geiger, mode (see also Single-photon avalanche diode). In Geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high (using high voltage) that a single photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit. However, owing to the avalanche of current, a reset of the photomultiplier is required. In either case, the photomultiplier can detect individual photons. The drawback, however, is that not every photon incident on the primary surface is counted either because of less-than-perfect efficiency of the photomultiplier, or because a second photon can arrive at the photomultiplier during the \\"dead time\\" associated with a first photon and never be noticed. A photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons; this is called the dark current. Photon-counting applications generally demand photomultipliers designed to minimise dark current. Nonetheless, the ability to detect single photons striking the primary photosensitive surface itself reveals the quantization principle that Einstein put forth. Photon counting (as it is called) reveals that light, not only being a wave, consists of discrete particles (i.e., photons).

General overview A significant number of Moorcock's novels and short stories take place in one shared Multiverse: a wide array of interconnected parallel universes, many-layered dimensions, spheres, and alternative worlds, which spans from the Big Bang to the End of Time and from Earth to faraway galaxies. All these regions of spaces and parallel timelines are given shape by two metaphysical forces which are perpetually opposed to each other: Law and Chaos, which represent perpetual stasis and ever-changing disorder. Since a clear-cut prevalence of either Law or Chaos would erase all life from the Multiverse, a third force known as the Cosmic Balance enforces certain limits on the powers of Law and Chaos, which in turn ensure the continued existence of the Multiverse. Law, Chaos, and the Balance are implied to be non-sentient, but they do manifest through god-like beings who express one facet or another of the three cosmic principles, and in turn, these deities can empower mortal creatures as their heralds and representatives. The Eternal Champion is, as a matter of fact, an appointed paladin of Balance who is bound to exist in each and every world and age of the Multiverse, so that Law and Chaos are perpetually kept in check; however, he often does not know of his role, or, even worse, he struggles against it, never to succeed. Since he must intervene whenever either Law or Chaos has gained an excess of power, requiring him to tip the scales accordingly, he is always doomed to be surrounded by strife and destruction, although he may go through long periods of relative quiet. All the different Eternal Champions are implied to be different facets or \\"incarnations\\" of one semi-conscious being (a Platonic archetype of a sort): most of them are peerless fighters and generals and have an unbreakable bond with a sentient Chaos-aligned weapon, the Black Sword, which in turns takes on a different overall for each Champion. Likewise, many Champions are aided by an Eternal Companion and an Eternal Consort: a sidekick and a love interest who are themselves aspects of two semi-divine figures. This recursivity through the Multiverse is further underlined by the number of Champions, Companions, and mentor-figures to the Champions Moorcock has given the J and C initials, as a form of naming fil rouge; in the same vein, many Champions and Companions belongs to one branch or another of the extensive von Bek dynasty. Space- and time-travels through the Multiverse are in fact possible, to the point that one humanoid species called the Eldrens is spread among many different worlds and ages and interacts with many different Champions; however, cosmic laws establish that no two Eternal Champions can coexist in the same situation, or the very fabric of reality would be severely damaged. The only exceptions are cataclysmic events such as the end of a Cycle of Cycles of the Multiverse's progression, or an invasion by hostile entities from an entirely separate multiverse: in these cases, different incarnations of the Champion may join forces to thwart the impending threat, possibly by temporarily merging their individual bodies into a true demigod of immense power. Incarnations The following list presents all known Champions in alphabetical order, mentions their respective Swords, Companions, and Consorts, and briefly summarizes their individual plotlines and publishing history. * Alerik * Alivale * Konrad Arflane: the hero of the postapocalyptic novel The Ice Schooner (1969), Arflane lives during a new ice age that has engulfed most of Earth and forced the surviving humans to revert to a hunting- gathering economy; he sets sails on the eponymous ice schooner to reach the fabled settlement of New York and scavenge all ancestral knowledge that could help restore human civilization. * Artos the Celt * Asquiol of Pompeii * Aubec, Earl of Malador: Aubec debuted in a 1964 short story titled either \\"The Dream of Earl Aubec\\" or \\"Master of Chaos\\" depending on the collection: he lives on the same world as Elric of Melnibon√© many generations before Elric's birth, serves as a national champion of the human kingdom of Lormyria and is the paramour of the Lormyrian monarch, Queen Eloarde. Moorcock planned a whole series about Aubec's wars against Melnibon√© in order to ensure human independence, eventually reconnecting to Elric's saga as a direct prequel, but the project was eventually aborted. * Captain Oswald Bastable: the main character and narrator of the Nomad of Time series (1971-1981), Captain Bastable is an officer of the British Imperial Army stationed in the Raj in the early 20th Century, until a series of time-travel incidents transports him into three different uchronias: a 1973 where the World Wars have not been fought and the British Empire is now encroached by decolonizing movements; a 1904 where Europe has been left in tatters by a precocious and even more devastating Great War; a 1941 where the British and German Empires are firmly allied. Bastable's misadventures in these alternative timelines are constructed as a biography and literary historians regard them as the prototypes of the steampunk subgenre. * Brian * Jherek Carnelian: one of the last humans to be alive on Earth as the Multiverse is nearing the End of Time, Carnelian is a creature of semi-divine power, hedonistic interests, and obnoxious morality (not unlike his fellow End-Timers), but his lifestyle changes forever once he falls in love with Mrs. Amelia Underwood, a time traveler from the Nineteenth Century; the couple's courtship, relationship and shared adventures across time and space are the subject of three novels published from 1972 to 1976, later collected as The Dancers at the End of Time. In turn, Carnelian and Underwood's trilogy serves as a backdrop to the Legends at the End of Time: five more semi-autonomous short stories and novelettes taking place at the End of Time, themselves composed in the late Seventies. This series is characterized by a high number of cameos from other leading and supporting characters of the Eternal Champion mythos. * Jerry Cornelius: an adventurer and dimensional traveler Moorcock created in the mid- Sixties and developed for the following forty years, resulting in an early tetralogy of novels, The Cornelius Quartet (1968-1977), a ponderous collection of short fiction, The Lives and Times of Jerry Cornelius (1976), and a later exalogy of novels, The Cornelius Calendar (composed in two stages, 1976-1981 and 2002-2008), with more tales in the working. Cornelius' saga consists of a wide array of surreal situations kept together by the character's uniquely fluid identity and it represents an influential form of experimental literature in the wider context of parodical spy fiction novels (1970-1980), whose early version featured the non-Champion character Nick Allard; a Doctor Who licensed novel titled The Coming of the Terraphiles (2010), whose Captain Cornelius is, in fact, Jerry's incarnation in the Whoniverse; and The Distant Suns (1975), a late example of Golden Age science fiction Moorcock co-authored with James Cawthorn, where Jerry is depicted as an air force Colonel and a space explorer. Moreover, it is implied that Cornelius might have manifested across the Multiverse as Lord Jagged of Canaria from Jherek Carnelian's series, Jaspar Colinadous from one of Elric's adventures, Dorian Hawkmoon's Jehamia Cohnahlias, Corum's Jhary-a-Conel, and John Daker's Jermays the Crooked. Jerry's version of the Black Sword is a Needle Gun (later morphed into a Vibragun), his Consort is his own sister Catherine (depicted as his wife in The Distant Suns, to avoid any incestuous undertones), and he has a complicated bond with fellow chrononaut Una Persson. * John Daker: a human implied to come from 20th Century Earth, he is forced by Balance to reincarnate into various aspects of the Champion while staying fully aware of all his identities after every transmigration. Through his own series, he takes on four different personas: *# Lord Erekos√´: a warrior from an unspecified age of Earth's history and the only human capable of holding the radioactive sword Kunajana. At the beginning of the novel The Eternal Champion (1970) Erekos√´ has been dead for generations, but a necromantic ritual resurrects him as a new existence for John Daker; the reborn Erekos√´ consequently gets entangled into a total war between humans and Eldrens and into a love triangle between the two factions' princesses, Eldren Ermizhad and human Iolinda. *# Count Ulrik Skarlsol: once his missions as Erekos√´ are resolved, Daker is forcibly transferred into Count Ulrik Skarlsol, Lord of the Frozen Keep, a hybernated hero native to an ice-bound planet. During the novel Phoenix in Obsidian (1970) Count Ulrik embarks on a quest for the mysterious \\"Chalice\\" (possibly a counterpart of the Holy Grail) and is forced to wield the Cold Sword, an extremely powerful and malevolent form of the Black Sword. *# Clen of Clen-Gar: Daker assumes this identity during The Swords of Heaven, the Flowers of Hell (1979), a graphic novel co-authored by Moorcock and Howard Chaykin which bridges the time gap between the second and third prose novel. Clen is a human lord of a prosperous bucolic territory called \\"Heaven\\", whose \\"Angel\\" denizens are responsible for the abysmal state of their neighboring land of \\"Hell\\"; as the two country clashes in war, Clen gets romantically involved with Lady Gradesmor from Heaven. *# Prince Flamadin: Flamadin is the ruler of a dimension called Draachenheem and owns both the Dragon Sword (a Black Sword comparable in power to Ulrik Skarlson's Cold Sword) and the Actoris Stone, an enchanted gem that would later become Elric of Melnibon√©'s family heirloom. In The Dragon in the Sword (1986) Daker as Flamadin and his Companion from 20th Century Germany, Ulrich von Bek, travel across many interconnected dimensions to prevent a major cataclysm. * Elric of Melnibon√©: Moorcock's breakthrough character and the blueprint for all subsequent Eternal Champions, Elric lives in a prehistorical age of Earth and is the sorcerer- emperor of the Melnibon√©ans, a pre-human species of Chaos-aligned feys (later retconned into being a branch of the Eldren); he wields the soul-eating sword Stormbringer, on which he is co-dependent due to its frail health, and spends his life trying to thwart the Chaos God Arioch, who is also his undesired personal patron due to an ancestral Melnibon√©an tradition; the first and last novels in this series also feature Mournblade, Stormbringer's twin sword, which is wielded by Elric's kinsmen. In the early stages of his saga, Elric is enamored of his cousin Princess Cymoril and gets one-time help from Oone the Dreamthief, an enchantress, and Count Smiorgan, a well known reaver; later on, he falls in love with the human aristocrat Zarozinia and casts his lot with Moonglum of Elwher, a sybaritic sellsword, and Rackhir the Red Archer, a powerful paladin of Balance. Elric's series represents a major milestone in sword & sorcery fiction and, unlike Moorcock's later works, was composed anachronically: it originally consisted of seven short stories and one fix-up novel written from 1961 to 1967, but it was later expanded with an origin story, a prequel and a midquel in the early Seventies, a third prequel and a second midquel in the early Nineties, and some more peripheral contents during the early 21st Century. * Franik * Professor Faustaff: the leading character of The Wrecks of Time (1965), he is a physicist fighting the space-faring marauders known as the D-Squads in order to protect a series of fifteen different Earths which exist parallelly to Faustaff's own planet. His connection to the other Champions is little more than nominal. * Goldberg * Duke Dorian Hawkmoon von K√∂ln: a German soldier in a post-nuclear Europe where magic and ancient technology coexist, Duke Hawkmoon embarks on a quest together with his retainer Oladahn to recover the fabled Runestaff (a magical talisman akin to the Holy Grail) and protect the world from the warmongering Dark Empire of Granbretan, which is ruled by the ruthless half-human half- machine King Huon; as this enterprise progresses, Hawkmoon if forced to bear the enchanted Black Jewel, a manifestation of the Black Sword, and falls in love with Yisselda Brass, heiress of a fiefdom in the land of Kamarg. Dorian's war against Granbretan is chronicled in the Runestaff tetralogy (1967-1969) while his family life with Yisselda is central in the Count Brass trilogy (1973-1975), which culminates into a monumental crossover with Elric's, Daker's, and Corum's respective series. * Ilanth * Queen Ilian of Garathorm: one of the very few female Championesses, she teams up with Duke Hawkmoon once he travels to her own world during the Count Brass trilogy. * Karl Glogauer: a hedonist and a hippie with a countercultural background, in Behold the Mand (1969) Glogauer time-travels to Roman Palestine so that he can meet Jesus Christ; the later novel Breakfast in the Ruins (1972) details the character's homosexual romances and hallucinatory experiences in contemporary London. He also cameos in Jerry Cornelius's adventures. *Corum Jhaelen Irsei: a prince of the Vadhagh, a Law-aligned branch of the Eldren people, Corum effectively becomes the last of his kind after a disastrous war against the Mabdan, a species created by Chaos of which Homo sapiens is the Terran variant. After a period of thralldom, the mutilation of his left hand and right eye, and their replacement with prosthetics (hence his alias as Corum Llaw Ereint, \\"Corum of the Silver Hand\\"), the former prince rises in rebellion against his captors and wages a veritable crusade against Chaos, which takes place both in Corum's own age during the Swords trilogy (1971) and in a distant future during the Silver Hand trilogy (1973-1974). As his vendetta unfolds, Corum pursues troubled romances with two human women, Rhalina and Medhbh, and is reliably backed by Jhary-a-Conel, a well-versed dimensional traveler who occasionally supports Hawkmoon as well. Notice that Corum's name is an anagram of \\"Jeremiah Cornelius\\". * Jack Karaquazian: a leading character in the Second Ether trilogy (1995-1996), which depicts the power struggles between god-like beings (such as Karaquazian himself) of Lawful, Chaotic and neutral affiliation to take control of Balance and swing it their own respective way. Jack is involved in an entangled love affair with his Consort Colinda Dovero, his Companion Sam Oakenburst and Sam's other love interest Rose von Bek. * Klan the Spoiler *Michael Kane of Old Mars: the hero of a 1965 trilogy of novelettes, Michael Kane is a human from Earth transported to a fictional version of Mars, where he gets embroiled into swashbuckling adventures and court intrigues, including a romance with Martian queen Shizala. Kane is constructed as an explicit homage and throwback to the planetary romance subgenre and, more specifically, to John Carter of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs; in turn, the biographical style of the trilogy represents a direct antecedent to Oswald Constable's saga. * Mejink-La-Kos * M'v Okom Sebpt O'Riley, Gunholder of the Qui Lors Ventures: another female Championess, she wields the Black Sword under the guise of a soul-eating pistol, the Banning Gun. She acts as a mentor to Eric Beck in Elric: The Balance Lost. * Oshbek-Uy * Pournachas * Colonel Maxim Arturovitch \\"Pyat\\" Pyatnitski: possibly the only Champion whose adventures are fully mimetic rather than fantastical, Colonel Pyat is a long-lived Russian aristocrat and military man born on the 1st of January 1900. He spends his life traveling across the globe and getting entangled into all sorts of high-level political intrigues, effectively shaping the fates of Europe before, during, and after the World Wars; the love of his turbulent and opportunistic life is Honoria Cornelius, Jerry's mother. Moorcock composed the Pyat Quartet at a relatively slow pace between 1981 and 2006 and structured it as a self-celebratory four-volume autobiography by the Colonel himself, with Moorcock acting as an editor. * C. Ryan: the lead character of The Black Corridor (1969), Ryan lives in a dystopian future of rampaging xenophobia, nuclear warfare and societal collapse; he commandeers the interstellar spaceship Hope Dempsy and tries to bring a rag-tag group of refugees to safety. * The \\"Scar-Faced Brooder\\" or \\"Cronarch\\": a character from Moorcock's juvenile short stories later collected into the anthology The Time Dweller (1969), the Cronarch is later retconned into a Champion who preceded Count Urlik Skarlsol on the latter's same world. * Shaleen * Sojan the Swordsman: Moorcock's first original character, Sojan first appeared on the Tarzan Adventures magazine during the Fifties and his short stories were fixed-up into a novelette in 1977. He is a deceased Terran who reincarnates on the planet Zylor and embarks in a series of Burroughs-esque adventures. His sword and pneumatic gun are prototypes of the Black Sword, but his actual signature weapon is a shield (hence the moniker of \\"Sojan Shieldbearer\\"). * Umpata * Ghardas Valabasian, Conqueror of the Distant Suns * Graf Ulrich von Bek: a German soldier fighting in the Thirty Years' War, Graf Ulrich is the leading character of the historical fantasy novel The War Hound and the World's Pain (1981), in which he strikes a deal with the Devil and takes upon his family the duty of locating and guarding the Holy Grail; his Companion and Consort in this adventure are Gurni Gurnisson and Sabrina. Graf Ulrich's actions reverberate through space and time by making the von Beks aware of the Multiverse, the designated owners of the sword Ravenbrand (which is, in fact, Mournblade from Elric's series) and uniquely attuned to magic and dimensional travel, so that different members of the bloodline are involved in many other sagas and stand-alone episodes of the Eternal Champion mythos. Noteworthy Von Beks across the cycle are: ** Alan von Bek (originally Alan Powys, later retconned into a von Bek): a human from a distant future where humankind has retreated underground under the stewardship of a despotic government, Alan is a state functionary antagonizing a radical revolutionary known as \\"The Fireclown\\". Their struggle is the subject of the science fiction novel The Winds of Limbo (1965). ** Clovis Becker (originally Clovi Marca, later retconned into a distant von Bek): one of the last human denizens of a future Earth which has stopped rotating and is now divided between a daily and a nightly hemisphere, Clovis embarks on a quest to cure humankind's severe sterility and grant his species a future. His adventure is depicted in The Shores of Death (1966). ** Manfred von Bek: the main character of The City in the Autumn Stars (1986), a direct sequel to The War Hound and the World's Pain, Manfred carries on Graf Ulrich's quest for the Grail as Europe is engulfed by the French Revolution; he is aided by the Duchess of Crete, Libussa Cartagena y Mendoza-Chilperic. ** Renark von Bek: a citizen of humankind's stellar empire established in the aftermath of World War Three, Renark is tasked with traveling to a secluded dimension known as the Sundered Worlds so that he can stabilize the Multiverse and prevent its untimely collapse. He stars in The Sundered Worlds (1965), Moorcock's very first full- length novel. ** Rose von Bek: the last survivor of a militant order devoted to Balance, she was originally known as \\"The Rose\\", but married into the von Bek family and kept the surname after her divorce. She is a one-time support character in Elric's saga and a co-protagonist in the Second Ether series. While no Championess herself, her cosmic power is comparable to that of the various Champions. Her signature weapons are the sword Swift Thorn and the dagger Little Thorn. ** Ulrich von Bek: a direct descendant of Graf Ulrich, he rebels against Adolf Hitler and escapes death by serving as an Eternal Companion to John Daker once the latter incarnates into Prince Flamadin during The Dragon in the Sword; their shared endeavors lead Ulrich to fall in love with female Eldren Alisaard. ** Ulric von Bek: a distinct character from the former (notice the h-less spelling of his name), he too opposes the Third Reich together with his wife Oona von Bek, a half-human half-Melnibon√©an hybrid who has relocated to 20th Century Germany. The couple is the leading characters of the Moonbeam Roads Trilogy (2001-2005), an explicit crossover between Elric's saga and the Von Beks'. The events of this series also imply that John Daker could be part-Melnibon√©an himself. ** Count Ulrich Rudric Renark Otto von Bek-Krasny, also known as \\"Zenith the Albino\\": an Eternal Champion existing on 20th Century Earth and most likely a reincarnation of Elric of Melnibon√©, since his Black Sword is Stormbringer itself; he is a criminal mastermind and is perpetually engaged into a cat-and-mouse game against his distant cousin Sir Seaton Begg, a British detective belonging to the English branch of the von Beks. Zenith and Begg's shared adventure were composed anachronically and collected for the first time in The Metatemporal Detective (2007) and some of them also appear in the second volume of the Second Ether series, Fabulous Harbours (1995), which results in a crossover between the two series. ** Eric Beck: the main character of the graphic novel Elric: The Balance Lost (2011-2012), he is an Eternal Champion living on 21st Century Earth and gets dragged into an ensemble adventure together with Elric, Hawkmoon, Corum, Oswald Bastable, and the cast of the Second Ether series. His Black Sword is a Japanese katana named Murakamo-No-Tsurugi (\\"Sword of the Gathering Clouds\\"). He is likely a collateral member of the Von Bek dynasty through the Begg lineage. In addition to Moorcock's own creations, a number of references through his works have stated that Ulysses and Roland have been Earth's Eternal Champions as well. The Tale of the Eternal Champion  Between 1992 and 1993 Moorcock partnered with British publisher Orion Publishing Group to print a 14-volumes collection of novels and short stories belonging to the Eternal Champion macro-series, under the moniker of \\"The Tale of the Eternal Champion\\"; starting from 1994 and up to 2000, a parallel project was undertaken by White Wolf Publishing for the North American market, and this version of the imprint ended up including some contents left out of its European counterpart due to licensing issues. While by no means complete, the White Wolf edition was the most extensive author-endorsed collection up to that point and has served as a basis for subsequent expanded anthologies.

Usually called \\"The Ducks\\" by their fans, they were known for up-tempo, energetic performances, and the successful careers of their members, after they disbanded. History The band formed in February 1972, with ex Brinsley Schwarz roadie Martin Belmont on guitar, former Help Yourself collaborator Sean Tyla, also on guitar, ex Help Yourself bassist Ken Whaley, and Magic Michael (Michael Cousins) on percussion. They named themselves after a slot machine at the Severn Bridge Service Station. Cousins was soon replaced by drummer Tim Roper and former Flamin' Groovies roadie, Nick Garvey, also joined. Playing more energetic music than most others on the London pub-rock circuit, the Ducks soon had a twice weekly booking at the Tally Ho in Kentish Town,Ducks Deluxe - The Manband Archive retrieved 13 November 2008 and a manager, Dai Davies. Whaley left, and later rejoined Help Yourself, and in December 1972, the Ducks recorded two tracks at Man's Christmas party, one of which,\\"Boogaloo Babe\\", was released on a double 10\\" album Christmas at the Patti, their first appearance on a record.Biguntidy Article on Ducks Deluxe retrieved 13 November 2008 In 1973 the band signed to RCA and released their first single, Coast To Coast, written by Sean Tyla and Nick Garvey, though Tyla is not credited on the track, because he was trying to untangle himself from a previous publishing deal. They also appeared in BBC TV Play for Today called Blooming Youth. Their eponymous debut album Ducks Deluxe was released in early 1974, and \\"captures something of the fire and excitement that the Ducks' live act generated\\". Keyboard and bass player Andy McMaster joined from The Sabres, to record a second album,Taxi To The Terminal Zone but this was regarded as disappointing and McMaster left. The band recorded its first Peel Session in April 1974 BBC Peel Sessions - Ducks Deluxe retrieved 13 November 2008 after which Garvey left and bassist Micky Groome joined. Despite recording a second Peel Session in March 1975 RCA dropped the band, so they were reduced to issuing an EP, Jumpin on the French label Skydog. Tim Roper left so former Brinsley Schwarz members Brinsley Schwarz and Billy Rankin played on the final tour, with the final gig being at the 100 Club in London on 1 July 1975. In 1978, RCA Victor released the compilation album Don't Mind Rockin' Tonite, featuring six songs from the band's debut LP, three from Taxi to the Terminal Zone (unavailable in the US at the time), and a few non-album singles. Reviewing the compilation in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \\"The music is pure rock and roll, maybe too pure, combining the Rumour's spirited intensity and the Motors' cheerful manipulation at a more primitive stage. Fans of the Tyla Gang will dig it.\\" Later careers Nick Garvey and Andy McMaster formed The Motors with Rob Hendry (later replaced by Bram Tchaikovsky) and drummer Ricky Slaughter. Sean Tyla formed \\"The Tyla Gang\\", which would later include Ken Whaley, who had joined Man after Help Yourself broke up. The Tyla Gang featured Canadian Bruce Irvinere and the former Winkies rhythm section of Brian Turrington on bass and Mike Desmarais on drums. They released two albums, Yachtless and Moonproof on the US-based, Beserkley label before the label's UK operation went bankrupt in 1978 and the band disbanded. Tyla embarked on a solo career and released three albums, Just Popped Out, Redneck In Babylon and Rhythm Of The Swing, the first of which produced Tyla's first Top ten single, Breakfast In Marin in Germany in 1980. Tyla and Micky Groome along with drummer, Paul Simmons then joined Man's Deke Leonard to form \\"The Force\\", until Tyla decided to retire from the music business completely, due to ill health. Groome stayed with Leonard to reform \\"Deke Leonard's Iceberg\\". Brinsley Schwarz and Martin Belmont joined Brinsley's former keyboard player Bob Andrews to support Graham Parker as Graham Parker & the Rumour, as well as appearing without Parker, as \\"The Rumour\\". Belmont later played in Carlene Carter's CC Riders and Nick Lowe's Cowboy Outfit. Roper, the original drummer, moved to Norwich, where he became a well-known figure in local bands. He died in February 2003 from alcohol- related symptoms, following a nervous breakdown. The first album, Ducks Deluxe, achieved moderate commercial success after the band broke up, because the members had gone on to greater fame in Graham Parker & the Rumour, The Tyla Gang and The Motors. Reunion The band reformed to celebrate the 35th anniversary of their original formation. This was at the 100 Club in London on 9 October 2007. The line-up was Martin Belmont, Sean Tyla, Micky Groome and Billy Rankin. A further gig took place on 9 November at The Musician in Leicester. On 26 January 2008 they played Centre Culturel de Paul Baillart, Massy, near Paris, France. On 20 September 2008 they played the PopXiria Festival in Carballo, near A Coru√±a in Spain, headlining the final night of the event. In 2009, Ducks Deluxe toured Sweden from 29 March to 13 April. The band consisted of Sean Tyla, vocals and guitar; Martin Belmont, guitar and vocals; Kevin Foster (of Hank Wangford & the Lost Cowboys and Los Pisteleros fame) bass guitar and backing vocals; and Jim Russell, (ex Stretch, Wild Angels, and The Inmates) on drums.Hawkhead Records retrieved 21 April 2009 They released their first new material, a mini CD \\"Box Of Shorts\\" on 18 May 2009 comprising six new studio tracks, produced by Paul 'Bassman' Riley. A new full album, Side Tracks And Smokers, was released in June 2010 with artwork by famous Stiff Records designer Tobbe Stuhre, and tracks including some recently found and remastered raw mixes of tracks from the early albums, and also some brand new Ducks Deluxe recordings. It was followed in 2011 by a lo-fi live recording, Riviera Shuffle on Jungle Records which was only available through mail order.

CNET News.com.  Description  The Luzon Strait is approximately wide containing a number of islands belonging to the Philippines that are grouped into two: the islands comprising the province of Batanes and the Babuyan Islands, which are part of the province of Cagayan. The strait is divided into a number of smaller channels. The Babuyan Channel separates Luzon from the Babuyan Islands, which is separated from Batanes by the Balintang Channel. Batanes is separated from Taiwan by the Bashi Channel. Some of the largest ocean waves in the world, at times over 170 meters in height and stemming from tides and ocean currents, are found in the north of the strait. These waves or currents are underwater and rarely break the surface, thus posing no danger to shipping but are sometimes visible to satellites. The oscillation is largely prompted by a long north‚Äìsouth ridge which covers almost all of the strait, then amplified in the northern section by a second parallel ridge.Oskin, Becky (2014-01-09). \\"Ocean's Huge Hidden Waves Explained\\"\\".

History  The Luzon Strait was part of the Japanese invasion route during the Second World War. On 8 December 1941 (the same day as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, due to the International Date Line), forces of the Empire of Japan landed on Batanes. By 10 December, they had occupied Camiguin de Babuyanes in the Babuyan Islands (not to be confused with the island-province of Camiguin off northern Mindanao) in a soon-abandoned attempt to establish a seaplane base, and on the same day landed at Aparri, Cagayan on Luzon. Subsequently, during the Second World War, many US submarines hunted Japanese convoys passing through the strait on their way from the East Indies to Japan.

Early life  William Henry Johnson was born one of six children to a very poor African- American family. His parents were William and Mahalia Johnson, former slaves. As he grew, his body developed normally but his head remained small. His tapering cranium and heavy jaw made him attractive to agents from van Emburgh's Circus in Somerville, New Jersey. His unusual appearance caused many to believe that he was a \\"pinhead\\", or microcephalic. Microcephaly patients are characterized by a small, tapering cranium and often have impaired mental faculty. It is arguable, however, whether William Henry was intellectually disabled. William Henry's parents agreed to allow the circus to display him in return for money. He was billed as a missing link, supposedly caught in Africa and displayed in a cage. He was a popular attraction, and his success led young William Henry's agent to show his charge to showman P.T. Barnum. Barnum purchased the right to display William Henry Johnson from the circus and gave him a new look. A furry suit was made to fit him, and his hair was shaped to a tiny point that further accented his sloping brow. Finally, he was given the name, \\"Zip the Pinhead\\", the \\"What-Is-It?\\"  As Zip the Pinhead  Zip's early performances were set against a background story. It was told to the audience that a tribe of \\"missing links\\" had been discovered in Africa, and that Zip was one of these. It was further explained that the \\"wild man\\", the \\"What-Is-It\\", subsisted on raw meat, nuts, and fruit, but was learning to eat more civilized fare such as bread and cake. Zip would then be revealed in a cage where he could rattle the bars and screech. This act was tremendously successful for Barnum, and Zip was as big an attraction to Barnum's American Museum as the famous Siamese twins, Chang and Eng Bunker. In later years, Zip became more \\"civilized\\" in his act. He shared the stage with other anomalies, including his friends Jim Tarver, the Texas Giant; Jack Earle, the Tallest Man in the World; Koo-Koo the Bird Girl and many others. Zip also traveled extensively with the Ringling Brothers circus. Zip drew the attention of important figures of the time. In 1860, he was visited at the museum by Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales; his photo was taken by famed Civil War photographer Mathew Brady.Racial profiling  The San Diego Union-Tribune Throughout this period, Zip's best friend and manager was Captain O.K. White. White conscientiously looked after Zip's interests. He also gave Zip one of his prized possessions, a tuxedo. He would wear the tuxedo on special occasions such as birthdays. One of his other possessions was a fiddle. It was said that he purchased the fiddle in Kentucky and that it had once belonged to Daniel Boone. Zip was most unskillful with the instrument, but it is reported that audiences loved seeing Zip play his fiddle and dance about with it. In his later years, Zip eschewed traveling in favor of performing at Coney Island. One Sunday afternoon in 1925, Zip heard a little girl cry for help. He noticed the girl waving her arms in the ocean and swam out to rescue her.Zip Rescues Drowning Girl  Brooklyn Daily Eagle, June 29, 1925 Zip caught bronchitis in early 1926, and despite the wishes of his doctor and Captain White, he continued to perform his part in the stage play Sunny at the New Amsterdam Theater. Upon the closing of the play, he returned to his home in Bound Brook, New Jersey, where he was cared for by his doctor, Captain White, and his sister. When his condition worsened, he was moved to Bellevue Hospital in New York City, where he died. It is estimated that during his 67 years in show business, Zip entertained more than one hundred million people. He was termed \\"The Dean of Freaks\\". His funeral was attended by some of the most popular side show acts, including Jane Barnell, the Bearded Lady; Frank Graf and a tattooed man. During the ceremonies, the distraught Captain White collapsed, and he died three days later. Zip the Pinhead was buried in Plot 399 of the Bound Brook Cemetery on April 28, 1926. A small gravestone bearing the inscription \\"William H. Johnson, 1857‚Äì1926\\" marks his resting place. However, his age as written on his burial certificate is 83 years, which would have meant he was born in 1842 or 1843, which seems more likely considering his 1860 photograph; 1857 is more likely the year he began his career. Zippy the Pinhead Comic Johnson is partly the inspiration for Bill Griffith's comics character, Zippy the Pinhead. He was featured in the \\"Freak Show Tech\\" episode of the History Channel series Wild West Tech. Although Johnson was not the first pinhead in the American circus sideshows, his costumes and presentation led to the display of several other microcephalic people to the American public.  Mental capacity  William Henry Johnson may not have been microcephalic; he may have merely had an odd-shaped head. Additionally, he possibly did not suffer the mental disabilities that microcephalic people often suffer. There has been some interest in ascertaining Zip's actual mental capacity. William Henry's sister, Sarah van Duyne, claimed in a 1926 interview that her brother would \\"converse like the average person, and with fair reasoning power\\". According to the interview with his sister, Zip's last words to her were \\"Well, we fooled 'em for a long time, didn't we?\\" References External links *Weird NJ ‚Äì Zip the What Is It *The Human Marvels ‚Äì ZIP THE PINHEAD ‚Äì What is it? *The Real 1842 Zip the Pinhead from Liberty Corner, New Jersey * 1850s births 1926 deaths African-American people People from Bernards Township, New Jersey People from Bound Brook, New Jersey Sideshow performers Burials in New Jersey People with microcephaly ","title":"Zip the Pinhead"},{"id":"177228","title":"Roberta Flack"},{"id":"177232","text":"The Victor Talking Machine Company was an American record company and phonograph manufacturer headquartered in Camden, New Jersey. The company was founded by engineer Eldridge R. Johnson, who had been manufacturing gramophones for inventor Emile Berliner, to play his disc records.Gelatt, Roland, The Fabulous Phonograph: 1877‚Äî1977, MacMillan, New York, 1954. After a series of legal wranglings between Berliner, Johnson and their former business partners, the two joined to form the Consolidated Talking Machine Co. in order to combine Berliner's patents for the disc record and Gramophone, along with Johnson's patents for improving its performance and fidelity. The Victor Talking Machine Co. was incorporated officially on October 3, 1901 shortly before an agreement with Columbia Records to share their various disc record patents. Nipper Victor IV gramophone. Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milan. Victor had acquired the Pan-American rights to use the now famous trademark of the fox terrier Nipper quizzically listening to a gramophone when Berliner and Johnson affiliated their fledgling companies. (See also His Master's Voice.) The original painting was an oil on canvas by Francis Barraud in 1898. Barraud's deceased brother, a London photographer, willed him his estate including his DC-powered Edison-Bell cylinder phonograph with a case of cylinders and his dog Nipper. Barraud's original painting depicts Nipper staring intently into the horn of an Edison- Bell while both sit on a polished wooden surface. The horn on the Edison-Bell machine was black and after a failed attempt at selling the painting to a cylinder record supplier of Edison Phonographs in the UK, a friend of Barraud's suggested that the painting could be brightened up (and possibly made more marketable) by substituting one of the brass-belled horns on display in the window at the new gramophone shop on Maiden Lane. The Gramophone Company in London was founded and managed by an American, William Barry Owen. Barraud paid a visit with a photograph of the painting and asked to borrow a horn. Owen gave Barraud an entire gramophone and asked him to paint it into the picture, offering to buy the result. On close inspection, the original painting still shows the contours of the Edison-Bell phonograph beneath the paint of the gramophone. Dozens of copies of \\"His Master's Voice\\" were painted by Barraud, several of them commissioned for executives of the Gramophone Company and Victor, though Barraud apparently would paint copies for anybody who paid him for one. The original painting is in the archives of EMI Records (successor to the Gramophone company in the UK), now owned by Universal Music Group. In 1915, the \\"His Master's Voice\\" logo was rendered in immense circular leaded-glass windows in the tower of the Victrola cabinet building at Victor's headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The building still stands today with replica windows installed during RCA's ownership of the plant in its later years. Today, one of the original windows is located at the Smithsonian museum in Washington, D.C. Name There are different accounts as to how the \\"Victor\\" name came about. RCA historian Fred Barnum gives various possible origins of the name in \\"His Master's Voice\\" In America, he writes, \\"One story claims that Johnson considered his first improved Gramophone to be both a scientific and business 'victory.' A second account is that Johnson emerged as the 'Victor' from the lengthy and costly patent litigations involving Berliner and Frank Seaman's Zonophone. A third story is that Johnson's partner, Leon Douglass, derived the word from his wife's name 'Victoria.' Finally, a fourth story is that Johnson took the name from the popular 'Victor' bicycle, which he had admired for its superior engineering. Of these four accounts the first two are the most generally accepted.\\"Barnum, Fred, \\"'His Master's Voice' In America\\", General Electric Co, 1991. , Perhaps coincidentally, the first use of the Victor title on a letterhead, on March 28, 1901,The Talking Machine Review International, Ernie Bayly ¬© 1973 The Gramophone Company Limited was only nine weeks after the death of British Queen Victoria. Acoustical recording era Enrico Caruso with a customized Victrola given to him as a wedding gift by the Victor Company in 1918 Before 1925, recording was done by the same purely mechanical, non-electronic \\"acoustical\\" method used since the invention of the phonograph nearly fifty years earlier. No microphone was involved and there was no means of electrical amplification. The recording machine was essentially an exposed-horn acoustical record player functioning in reverse. One or more funnel-like metal horns was used to concentrate the energy of the airborne sound waves onto a recording diaphragm, which was a thin glass disc about two inches in diameter held in place by rubber gaskets at its perimeter. The sound-vibrated center of the diaphragm was linked to a cutting stylus that was guided across the surface of a very thick wax disc, engraving a sound-modulated groove into its surface. The wax was too soft to be played back even once without seriously damaging it, although test recordings were sometimes made and sacrificed by playing them back immediately. The wax master disc was sent to a processing plant where it was electroplated to create a negative metal \\"stamper\\" used to mould or \\"press\\" durable replicas of the recording from heated \\"biscuits\\" of a shellac-based compound. Although sound quality was gradually improved by a series of small refinements, the process was inherently insensitive. It could only record sources of sound that were very close to the recording horn or very loud, and even then the high-frequency overtones and sibilants necessary for clear, detailed sound reproduction were too feeble to register above the background noise. Resonances in the recording horns and associated components resulted in a characteristic \\"horn sound\\" that immediately identifies an acoustical recording to an experienced modern listener and seemed inseparable from \\"phonograph music\\" to contemporary listeners. From the start, Victor innovated manufacturing processes and soon rose to pre-eminence by recording famous performers. In 1903, it instituted a three-step mother-stamper process to produce more stampers than previously possible. After improving the quality of disc records and players, Johnson began an ambitious project to have the most prestigious singers and musicians of the day record for Victor, with exclusive agreements where possible. Even if these artists demanded high fees or royalty advances which the company could not hope to immediately make up from the sales of their records, Johnson shrewdly knew that he would get his money's worth in the long run in promotion of the Victor brand name. These new celebrity recordings bore red labels, and were marketed as Red Seal records. For many years, Victor Red Seal records were only available single-sided: not until 1923 did Victor begin offering Red Seals in more economical double-sided form. Countless advertisements were published, praising the renowned stars of the opera and concert stages and boasting that they recorded only for Victor. As Johnson intended, the majority of the record-buying public assumed from all this that Victor Records must be superior. In the company's early years, Victor issued recordings on the Victor, Monarch and De Luxe labels, with the Victor label on 7-inch records, Monarch on 10-inch records and De Luxe on 12-inch records. De Luxe Special 14-inch records were briefly marketed in 1903‚Äì1904. In 1905, all labels and sizes were consolidated into the Victor imprint. A Victor Talking Machine The Victor recordings made by world-famous tenor Enrico Caruso between 1904 and 1920 were particularly successful and were often used by retailers to demonstrate Victor phonographs; Caruso's powerful voice and unusual timbre highlighted the best range of audio fidelity of the early audio technology while being minimally affected by its defects. Even people who otherwise never listened to opera often owned a record or two of the great voice of Caruso. Victor recorded numerous classical musicians, including Jascha Heifetz, Fritz Kreisler, Victor Herbert, Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Sergei Rachmaninoff in recordings at its home studios in Camden, New Jersey and in New York. Rachmaninoff, in particular, became one of the first composer-performers to record extensively; he recorded exclusively for Victor from 1920 to 1942. Arturo Toscanini's long association with Victor also began in 1920, with a series of records conducting members of the orchestra of the La Scala Opera House of Milan. He recorded for the company until his retirement in 1954. The first jazz and blues records were recorded by the Victor Talking Machine Company. The Victor Military Band recorded the first recorded blues song, \\"The Memphis Blues\\", on July 15, 1914 in Camden, New Jersey. In 1917, The Original Dixieland Jazz Band recorded \\"Livery Stable Blues\\", and established jazz as popular music. Electrical recording era Victor \\"scroll\\" label from 1930, featuring the company's house band directed by Nathaniel Shilkret The advent of radio as a home entertainment medium in the early 1920s presented Victor and the entire record industry with new challenges. Not only was music becoming available over the air free of charge, but a live broadcast made using a high-quality microphone and heard over a high-quality receiver provided clearer, more \\"natural\\" sound than a contemporary record. In 1925, Victor switched from the acoustical or mechanical method of recording to the new microphone-based electrical system developed by Western Electric. Victor called its version of the improved fidelity recording process \\"Orthophonic\\", and sold a new line of record players, called \\"Orthophonic Victrolas\\", scientifically designed to play these improved records. Victor's first electrical recordings were made and issued in the spring of 1925. However, in order to create sufficient catalogs of them to satisfy anticipated demand, and to allow dealers time to liquidate their stocks of acoustical recordings, Victor and its rival, Columbia, agreed to keep secret from the public, until near the end of 1925, the fact that they were making the new electrical recordings which offered a vast improvement over the ones currently available. Then, with a large advertising campaign, Victor openly announced the new technology and introduced its Orthophonic Victrolas on \\"Victor Day\\", November 2, 1925. The \\"VE\\", indicating a Victor electrical recording Victor's first commercial electrical recording was made at the company's Camden, New Jersey studios on February 26, 1925. A group of eight popular Victor artists, Billy Murray, Frank Banta, Henry Burr, Albert Campbell, Frank Croxton, John Meyer, Monroe Silver, and Rudy Wiedoeft gathered to record \\"A Miniature Concert\\". Several takes were recorded by the old acoustical process, then additional takes were recorded electrically for test purposes. The electrical recordings turned out well, and Victor issued the results that summer as the two sides of twelve inch 78 rpm record Victor 35753. Victor's first electrical recording to be issued was Victor 19626, a ten inch disc consisting of two numbers recorded on March 16, 1925 from the University of Pennsylvania's thirty-seventh annual production of the Mask and Wig Club, issued in April, 1925. On March 21, 1925, Victor recorded its first electrical Red Seal disc, twelve inch 6502 by pianist Alfred Cortot, of pieces by Chopin and Schubert.Victor Recording Book log, pp. 4761 and 4761A. Victor quickly recorded the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Stokowski in a series at its Camden, New Jersey studios and then in Philadelphia's Academy of Music. Among Stokowski's first electrical recordings were performances of Danse Macabre by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns and Marche Slave by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Frederick Stock and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra made a series of recordings for Victor, beginning in 1925, first in Victor's Chicago studios and then in Orchestra Hall. The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra conducted by Alfred Hertz made a few acoustical recordings early in 1925, then switched to electrical recordings in Oakland and San Francisco, California, continuing until 1928. Within a few years, Serge Koussevitzky began a long series of recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Boston's Symphony Hall. Toscanini made his first Victor electrical recordings with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in November, 1929. The origins of country music as we know it today can be traced to two seminal influences and a remarkable coincidence. Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family are considered the founders of country music and their songs were first captured at an historic recording session in Bristol, Tennessee (also known as the Bristol Sessions) on August 1, 1927, where Ralph Peer was the talent scout and recording engineer for Victor. Acquisition by Radio Corporation of America In 1926, Johnson sold his controlling (but not holding) interest in the Victor Company to the banking firms of JW Seligman and Spyer & Co, who in turn sold Victor to the Radio Corporation of America in 1929. It then became known briefly as the Radio-Victor Division of the Radio Corporation of America, then the RCA Manufacturing Company, the RCA Victor Division and in 1968, RCA Records. Most record labels continued to bear only the \\"Victor\\" name until 1946, when the labels changed to \\"RCA Victor\\" and eventually, to simply \\"RCA\\" in late 1968, \\"Victor\\" becoming the label designation for RCA's popular music releases. (See RCA and RCA Records for later history of the Victor brand name.) Subsidiaries, partners, and plants Johnson and many Victor executives became extremely wealthy by the 1920s and in doing so were able to expand Victor's markets outside of the original Camden, NJ base of operations. Having established a hand-shake agreement with Emile Berliner in forming the Victor Talking Machine Co, Berliner was sent from the United States to manage the remaining holdings of the Gramophone Company (a company in which Victor owned a significant portion in part due to patent pooling agreements, and Victor's success in its first two decades). Eventually, this meant that Victor (in addition to owning studios, offices, and plants in Camden, New York City, Los Angeles, Oakland, Chicago, Montreal, Mexico City and South America) also owned controlling interests in the Gramophone Company in England, as well as the Deutsche Gramophone Co. in Europe. Soon, Victor formed the Victor Company of Japan (JVC), founded in 1927. As Radio Corporation of America acquired Victor, the Gramophone Co. in England became EMI giving RCA a controlling interest in JVC, Columbia (UK), and EMI. During World War II, JVC severed its ties to RCA Victor and today remains one of the oldest and most successful Japanese record labels as well as an electronics giant. Meanwhile, RCA sold its remaining shares in EMI during this time. Today the \\"His Master's Voice\\" trademark in music is split amongst several companies including JVC (in Japan), HMV (in the UK), and RCA (in the US). List of Victor Records artists Archives Victor kept meticulous written records of all of its recordings. The files cover the period 1903 to 1958 (thus including the RCA Victor era, as well as the Victor Talking Machine Co. era). These written records are among the most extensive and important sources of available primary discographic information in the world. There were three main categories of files: a daily log of recordings for each day, a file maintained for each important Victor artist, and a 4\\"√ó6\\" index card file kept in catalog number order. There are about 15,000 daily log pages, each titled \\"Recording Book,\\" that are numbered chronologically. Each recording was assigned a \\"matrix number\\" to identify the recording. When issued, the recording had a \\"catalog number,\\" almost always different from the matrix number, on the record label. As of 2010, the remaining pages available at the Victor archives go only up to April 22, 1935. Victor's original pages after this date were apparently discarded or lost at some point. However, Victor's ties with EMI in England, and at Hayes, Hillingdon, in London, EMI has more recent pages. These pages were sent at the time they were first written and therefore do not have the annotations made afterwards. Most, but not all, daily log information for recordings made for synchronization with motion pictures were kept separately, and the separate synchronization recording information is missing from the Victor archives. Victor also issued annual catalogs of all available recordings with monthly supplements announcing the release of new and forthcoming records issued throughout the year. These publications were carefully prepared and were lavishly illustrated with many photographs and advertisements of popular Victor recording artists. The Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings (EDVR) is a continuation of a project of Ted Fagan and William Moran to make a complete discography of all Victor recordings. The Victor archive files are a major source of information for this project. In 2011, the Library of Congress and Victor catalog owner Sony Music Entertainment launched the National Jukebox offering streaming audio of more than 10,000 pre-1925 recorded works for listening by the general public; many of these recordings have not been widely available for over 100 years. The Victrola and other products In September 1906, Victor introduced a new line of talking machines with the turntable and amplifying horn tucked away inside a wooden cabinet, the horn being completely invisible. This was not done for reasons of audio fidelity, but for visual aesthetics. The intention was to produce a phonograph that looked less like a piece of machinery and more like a piece of furniture. These internal horn machines, trademarked with the name Victrola, were first marketed to the public in September of that year and were an immediate hit. Soon an extensive line of Victrolas was available, ranging from small tabletop models selling for $15, through many sizes and designs of cabinets intended to go with the decor of middle-class homes in the $100 to $250 range, up to $600 Chippendale and Queen Anne-style cabinets of fine wood with gold trim designed to look at home in elegant mansions. Victrolas became by far the most popular type of home phonograph, and sold in great numbers until the end of the 1920s. RCA Victor continued to market record players under the Victrola name until the late 1960s. Other Victor products included the Electrola (a phonograph with an electric motor), Radiola (a radio often paired with a phonograph which was a joint venture with RCA prior to their acquisition of the company), and musical instruments (including the first electronic instrument, the theremin).

It stands on the River Trent, the A1 ‚Äì on the route of the ancient Great North Road, and the East Coast Main Line railway. The origins of the town are possibly Roman, as it lies on an important Roman road, the Fosse Way. The town grew around Newark Castle, now ruined, and a large market place, now lined with historic buildings. It was a centre for the wool and cloth trades. In the English Civil War, it was besieged by Parliamentary forces and relieved by Royalist forces under Prince Rupert. Today Newark has become a commuter town for the cities of Lincoln and Nottingham. History Signpost in Newark- on-Trent =Early history= The place-name Newark is first attested in the Cartulary of Eynsham Abbey in Oxfordshire, where it appears as Newercha in about 1054‚Äì1057 and Niweweorche in about 1075‚Äì1092. It appears as Newerche in the 1086 Domesday Book. The name means 'New work', with the apparent meaning of \\"New fort\\".Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place- names, p. 339. The origins of the town are possibly Roman, due to its position on an important Roman road, the Fosse Way. In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the Abbey of Peterborough by King Wulfhere of Mercia. An Anglo-Saxon pagan cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent. There cremated remains were buried in pottery urns. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, Newark belonged to Godiva and her husband Leofric, Earl of Mercia, who granted it to Stow Minster in 1055. After the Norman Conquest, Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop Remigius de F√©camp, after whose death control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of Edward VI. There were burgesses in Newark at the time of the Domesday survey. The reign of Edward III shows evidence that it had long been a borough by prescription. The Newark wapentake (hundred) in the east of Nottinghamshire was established in the period of Anglo-Saxon rule (10th‚Äì11th centuries). =Medieval to Stuart period= Newark Castle was originally a Saxon fortified manor house founded by King Edward the Elder. In 1073, Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln, founded an earthwork motte-and-bailey fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from Henry I, as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King Stephen to establish a mint. King John died of dysentery in Newark Castle in 1216. The town became a local centre for the wool and cloth trade ‚Äì by the time of Henry II a major market was established. Wednesday and Saturday markets in the town were founded in the period 1156‚Äì1329, under a series of charters from the Bishop of Lincoln. After his death, Henry III tried to bring order to the country, but the mercenary Robert de Gaugy refused to yield Newark Castle to the Bishop of Lincoln, its rightful owner. This led to the Dauphin of France (later King Louis VIII of France) laying an eight-day siege on behalf of the king, ended by an agreement to pay the mercenary to leave. Around the time of Edward III's death in \\"1377 Poll tax records show an adult population of 1,178, excluding beggars and clergy, making Newark one of the biggest 25 or so towns in England\\".Newark Future, 2008 . In 1457 a flood swept away the bridge over the Trent. Although there was no legal requirement to do so, the Bishop of Lincoln, John Chaworth, funded a new bridge of oak with stone defensive towers at either end. In January 1571 or 1572, the composer Robert Parsons fell into the swollen River Trent at Newark and drowned. Newark Castle ‚Äì interior After the break with Rome in the 16th century, the establishment of the Church of England, and the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII had the Vicar of Newark, Henry Lytherland, executed for refusing to acknowledge the king as head of the Church. The dissolution affected Newark's political landscape, and even more radical changes came in 1547, when the Bishop of Lincoln exchanged ownership of the town with the Crown. Newark was incorporated under an alderman and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by Elizabeth I. Charles I reincorporated the town under a mayor and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under James II, continued to govern the corporation until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. =The Civil War= shilling (siege piece) made from silver plate during the siege During the English Civil War, Newark was a mainstay of the Royalist cause, Charles I having raised his standard in nearby Nottingham. \\"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by the King after his own surrender.\\"Newark Civil War Trail . It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided Nottingham, Grantham, Northampton, Gainsborough and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. In 1644 Newark was besieged by forces from Nottingham, Lincoln and Derby, until relieved in March by Prince Rupert. Parliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir Marmaduke Langdale. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the Battle of Naseby, near Leicester in June 1645. The final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the Queen's Sconce to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2¬º miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in Sconce and Devon Park. =Georgian era and early 19th century= Newark Castle c. 1812 Around 1770 the Great North Road around Newark (now the A1) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special Act of Parliament in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by John Carr of York and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building, housing a museum and art gallery. In 1775 the Duke of Newcastle, at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today. A noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766‚Äì1799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by Thomas Paine.An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the Nottinghamshire Historian journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9‚Äì15, with further detail in autumn/winter 2003, pp. 8‚Äì12. In a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).See the report in Cornelius Brown 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the Times for 7 October 1829. A report in the Times of 10 September 1832 lists ten of the evicted people by name and address. J. S. Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830‚Äì1840, contributed to The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax (London, 1904), a book about the Corn Laws: \\"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\\" =19th‚Äì21st centuries= Many new buildings and much industry appeared in the Victorian era. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836‚Äì1837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N. Nicholson Trent Ironworks (1840s), Northgate Railway Station (1851), North End Wesleyan Chapel (1868), St Leonard's Anglican Church (1873), the Baptist Chapel (1876), the Primitive Methodist Chapel (1878), Newark Hospital (1881), Ossington Coffee Palace (1882), Gilstrap Free Library (1883), the Market Hall (1884), the Unitarian Chapel (1884), the Fire Station (1889), the Waterworks (1898), and the School of Science and Art (1900). The Ossington Coffee Palace was built by Lady Charlotte Ossington, daughter of the 4th Duke of Portland and widow of the former Speaker of the House of Commons, Viscount Ossington, designed to be a Temperance alternative to pubs and coaching inns. These changes and associated industrial expansion raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the 19th century. The Sherwood Avenue Drill Hall opened in 1914, just as the First World War began. Memorial cross to General Sikorski, Newark Cemetery During the Second World War, there were several RAF stations within a few miles of Newark, from many of which operated squadrons of the Polish Air Force. A special plot was set aside in Newark Cemetery for RAF burials and this is now the war graves plot, where all but ten of the 90 Commonwealth and all of the 397 Polish burials were made. The cemetery also contains 49 scattered burials from the First World War. A memorial cross to the Polish airmen buried here was unveiled in 1941 by President Raczkiewicz, ex-President of the Polish Republic and head of the wartime Polish Government in London, supported by General Sikorski, head of the Polish Armed Forces and wartime Polish Prime Minister. When both men died ‚Äì General Sikorski in 1943 and President Raczkiewicz in 1947 ‚Äì they were buried at the foot of the memorial. General Sikorski's remains were returned to Poland in 1993, but there is still a memorial to him in Newark. The prime industries in Newark in the last hundred years have been the manufacture of clothing, bearings, pumps, agricultural machinery and pine furniture, and the refining of sugar. British Sugar still has one of its sugar-beet processing factories to the north of the town near the A616 (Great North Road). There have been several factory closures, especially since the 1950s. The breweries in the town that closed in the 20th century included James Hole and Warwicks-and-Richardsons. Population The estimated population for Newark parish in 2007 was 26,330, increasing to 27,700 at the 2011 census. According to the 2001 census, it had a population of 25,376. The ONS Mid Year Population Estimates for 2007 indicate that the population had increased to some 26,700. \\"The population of Newark is approximately 35,000 and the rural area of Newark and Sherwood to the west of the town has an additional population of 75,000 in the small towns of Southwell and Ollerton and the numerous villages of the district.\\"The Town of Newark-on-Trent , Lincoln College. In ethnographic terms, Newark is 93 per cent white British, according to the 2011 census. It is also prosperous: 77 per cent of adults are employed, according to the latest ONS data, compared with a national average of 72 per cent. Earnings are 7 per cent above the average in the surrounding East Midlands. Geography Newark lies on the River Trent, with the River Devon also running through the town. Standing at the intersection of the Great North Road and the Fosse Way, Newark originally grew around Newark Castle, now ruined, and a large market place now lined with historic buildings. Newark forms a continuous built-up area with the neighbouring parish of Balderton to the south-east. To the south, along the A46 road, is Farndon, and to the north Winthorpe. Newark's growth and development have both been enhanced by having one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the East Coast Main Line and the Nottingham to Lincoln route. \\"Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,\\"Andrew Nicholson, Newark-on-Trent at Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway. though it industrialised to some extent in the Victorian era, and later with an ironworks, engineering, brewing, and a sugar refinery. The A1 bypass was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples. The single- carriageway, ¬£34-million A46 opened in October 1990. Governance Newark returned two representatives to the Unreformed House of Commons from 1673. It was the last borough to be created before the Reform Act. William Ewart Gladstone, later Prime Minister, became its MP in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, 1837 and 1841 (twice), but possibly due to his support of the repeal of the Corn Laws and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time. Newark elections were central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to Harold Laski, the Chairman of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, led Laski to sue the Daily Express when it reported him as saying that Labour might take power through violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the libel action. In the 1997 general election, Newark returned Fiona Jones of the Labour Party. Jones and her election agent Des Whicher were convicted of submitting a fraudulent declaration of expenses, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. Newark's former MP is Patrick Mercer, Conservative. Mercer held the position of Shadow Minister for Homeland Security from June 2003 until March 2007, when he was forced to resign after making racially contentious comments made to The Times. After a by-election on 5 June 2014 brought about by the resignation of Patrick Mercer, he was replaced by the Conservative Robert Jenrick, who was re-elected at the general election of 7 May 2015. Newark has three local-government tiers: Newark Town Council, Newark and Sherwood District Council and Nottinghamshire County Council. The 39 district councillors cover waste, planning, environmental health, licensing, car parks, housing, leisure and culture. The District Council opened a national Civil War Centre and Newark Museum in May 2015. Ten county councillors are elected to Nottinghamshire County Council for the area. Nottinghamshire County Council provides children's services, adult care, and highways and transport services. The town has an elected council of 18 members from four wards. Newark Town Council has taken on some responsibilities devolved by Newark and Sherwood District Council, including parks, open spaces and Newark Market. It also runs events such as the LocAle and Weinfest, a museum in the Town Hall, and allotments. A new police station, costing ¬£7 million, opened in October 2006. Education The Newark Academy is a mixed secondary school situated in nearby Balderton. Economy British Sugar PLC runs a mill on the outskirts of the town that opened in 1921. It has 130 permanent staff and processes 1.6 million tonnes of sugar beet produced by about 800 UK growers, at an average distance of 28 miles from the factory. Of the output, 250,000 tonnes are processed and supplied to food and drink manufacturers in the UK and across Europe. At the heart of the Newark factory's operations is a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, with boilers fuelled by natural gas to meet the site's steam and electricity requirements and contribute to the grid enough power for 800 homes. The installation is rated under the government CHP environmental quality-assurance scheme. Another employer is a bearings factory (part of the NSK group) with some 200 employees. A further notable employer is Laurens PattisseriesLaurens Patisseries, part of the food group Bakkav√∂r since May 2006, which bought it for ¬£130 million. It employs over 1,000 people. In 2007, Currys opened a ¬£30 million national distribution centre next to the A17 near the A46 roundabout, and Dixon's moved its national distribution centre there in 2005, with over 1,400 staff employed at the site at peak times. Flowserve, formerly Ingersoll Dresser Pumps, has a manufacturing facility in the town. Project Telecom in Brunel Drive was bought by Vodafone in 2003 for a reported ¬£163 million. Since 1985 Newark has been host to the biggest antiques outlet in Europe, the Newark International Antiques and Collectors Fair, held bi- monthly at Newark Showground. Newark has plentiful antique shops and centres. Culture Newark hosts Newark Rugby Union Football Club, whose players have included Dusty Hare, John Wells, Greig Tonks and Tom Ryder. The town has a leisure centre in Bowbridge Road, opened in 2016. Newark and Sherwood Concert Band has over 50 regular players and has performed at numerous area events in the last few years. Also based in Newark are the Royal Air Force Music Charitable Trust and Lincolnshire Chamber Orchestra. The Palace Theatre in Appletongate is Newark's main entertainment venue, offering drama, live music, dance and film. The National Civil War Centre and Newark Museum, next to the Palace Theatre in Appletongate in the town centre, opened in 2015 to interpret Newark's part in the English Civil War in the 17th century and explore its wider implications. Landmarks and treasures St. Mary Magdalene *The Market Place is the town's focal point. It includes The Queen's Head, one of the town's old pubs. *The Church of St. Mary Magdalene is a Grade I listed building, notable for its tower and octagonal spire ( high), the tallest in the county. It was heavily restored in the mid-19th century by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The reredos was added by Sir Ninian Comper. *Newark Castle was built by the Trent by Alexander of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln in 1123, who established it as a mint.Pettifer, pp. 148 and 201. Of the original Norman stronghold, the chief remains are the gate-house, a crypt and the tower at the south-west angle. King John died at the castle on the night of 18 October 1216.Fryde, Greenway, Porter and Roy, p. 37.Warren, pp. 254‚Äì255. In the reign of Edward III it was used as a state prison. During the English Civil War it was garrisoned for Charles I and endured three sieges. Its dismantling was begun in 1646, after the surrender of the king. *The 16th-century Governor's House, named after Sir Richard Willis, Castle Governor in the English Civil War, is in Stodman Street. Now housing a bread shop and cafe, it is a Grade I listed building. =Newark Torc= The Newark Torc, a silver and gold Iron Age torc, was the first found in Nottinghamshire. It closely resembles that of the Snettisham Hoard. Uncovered in 2005, it occupies a field on the town's outskirts, and in 2008 was acquired by Newark and Sherwood District Council. The torc was displayed at the British Museum in London until the opening of the National Civil War Centre and Newark Museum in May 2015. It is now shown in the museum galleries. Churches and other religious sites St Mary Magdalene's Church Newark's churches include the Grade I listed parish church, St Mary Magdalene. Other Anglican churches include Christ Church in Boundary Road and St Leonard's in Lincoln Road. The Catholic Holy Trinity Church was consecrated in 1979. Other places of worship include three Methodist churches,Newark Methodist Circuit. Retrieved 23 April 2020. the Baptist Church in Albert St, and the Church of Promise, founded in 2007. In 2014 the Newark Odinist Temple, a Grade II listed building in Bede House Lane, was consecrated according to the rites of the Odinist Fellowship, making this the first heathen temple operating in England in modern times. Transport Newark has two railway stations. The East Coast Main Line serves Newark North Gate railway station with links to London, King's Cross, Leeds, Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh. Newark Castle railway station on the Leicester‚ÄìNottingham‚ÄìLincoln line provides cross-country regional links. The two cross at the last flat crossing in Britain. Grade separation has been proposed. The main roads of Newark include the A1 and A46 as bypasses. The A17 runs east to King's Lynn in Norfolk, and the A616 north to Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. The bus-service providers include Stagecoach in Lincolnshire (\\"Newark busabouttown\\"), Marshalls and Travel Wright, under the control of Nottinghamshire County Council, Media The town's weekly Newark Advertiser, founded in 1854, is owned by Newark Advertiser Co Ltd, which also publishes local newspapers in Southwell and Bingham. The community station Radio Newark began broadcasting on 107.8 FM in May 2015, after three successful trials in 2014 and 2015. The station replaces a former community station, Boundary Sound, which ceased broadcasting in 2011.

Brixham is at the southern end of Torbay, across the bay (Tor Bay) from Torquay, and fishing and tourism are the major industries of the town. At the time of the 2011 census it had a population of 16,693. (Word document) It is thought that the name 'Brixham' came from Brioc's village. 'Brioc' was an old English or Brythonic personal name and '-ham' is an ancient term for home derived from Old English. The town is hilly and built around the harbour which remains in use as a dock for fishing trawlers. It has a focal tourist attraction in the replica of Sir Francis Drake's ship Golden Hind that is permanently moored there. Historically, Brixham was two separate communities with only a marshy lane to connect them. Cowtown was the area on top of the hill where the farmers lived, while a mile away around the harbour was Fishtown where the fishermen and seamen lived. Cowtown, the St Mary's Square area, is on the road leaving Brixham to the south west, in the direction of Kingswear, upon which stands a church built on the site of a Saxon original. The town holds a yearly pirate event which competes for the title of most pirates in one place and this draws visitors from far and wide. King William III landed in England at Brixham on 5 November 1688 on his way to become king as part of the Glorious Revolution.  History  Brixham, England c. 1895 Brixham Harbour c. 1895 Although there is evidence of Ice age inhabitants here, in Windmill Hill Cavern, and probable trading in the Bronze Age, the first evidence of a town comes from the Saxon times. It is possible that Saxon settlement originated by sea from Hampshire in the 6th century, or overland around the year 800. Brixham was called Briseham in the Domesday Book. Its population then was 39. Brixham was part of the former Haytor Hundred. The population was 3,671 in 1801 and 8,092 in 1901. In 1334, the town's value was assessed at one pound, twelve shillings and eightpence; by 1524, the valuation had risen to ¬£24 and sixteen shillings. It is recorded as a borough from 1536, and a market is recorded from 1822. William de Whithurst, a distinguished Crown official and judge in Ireland, became parish priest of Brixham in 1350.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 William Prince of Orange (afterwards King William III of Great Britain & Ireland) landed in Brixham, with his mainly Dutch army, on 5 November 1688 during the Glorious Revolution, and issued his famous declaration \\"The Liberties of England and The Protestant Religion I Will Maintain\\". A road leading from the harbour up a steep hill, to where the Dutch made their camp, is still called Overgang, Dutch for 'passage' or 'crossing'.\\"Overgang\\" at Lookwayup.com. (retrieved 17 January 2009) The coffin house reflects Brixham humour: it is coffin-shaped and when a father was asked for the hand in marriage of his daughter, he said he would 'see her in a coffin, before she wed'. The future son-in-law bought the coffin-shaped property, called it the Coffin House, and went back to the father and said: 'Your wishes will be met, you will see your daughter in a coffin, the Coffin House'. Amazed by this, the father gave his blessing.coffinhouse.co.uk The street names reflect the town's history. Pump Street is where the village pump stood. Monksbridge was a bridge built by the monks of Totnes Priory. Lichfield Drive was the route that the dead (from the Old English 'lich' meaning a corpse) were taken for burial at St Mary‚Äôs churchyard. Salutation Mews, near the church, dates from when England was Catholic, and the salutation was to the Virgin Mary. Similarly, Laywell Road recalls Our Lady‚Äôs Well. The first building seen when coming into Brixham from Paignton is the old white-boarded Toll House where all travellers had to pay a fee to keep the roads repaired. The tower of All Saints' Church, founded in 1815, stands guard over the town. The composer of Abide With Me, Rev. Francis Lyte was a vicar at the church. He lived at Berry Head House, now a hotel, and when he was a very sick man, near to dying, he looked out from his garden as dusk fell over Torbay, and the words of that hymn came into his mind. The main church is St. Mary's, about a mile from the sea. It is the third to have been on the site (which was an ancient Celtic burial ground). The original wooden Saxon church was replaced by a stone Norman church that was, in its turn, built over in about 1360. Many of the important townspeople are buried in the churchyard. Many of Brixham's photogenic cottages above the harbour were originally inhabited by fishermen and their families. Near the harbour is the famous Coffin House mentioned earlier. Many of the dwellings towards Higher Brixham were built largely between the 1930s to 1970s. Several holiday camps were built in this area, for example Pontin's Wall Park and Dolphin. The Dolphin was one of the company's biggest camps. The camp closed in 1991 after fire destroyed the main entertainments building. Brixham was served by the short Torbay and Brixham Railway from Churston. The line, opened in February 1868 to carry passengers and goods (mainly fish), was closed in May 1963 as a result of the Beeching Axe cuts. Although the former line to Brixham is deserted and overgrown, the branch line through nearby Churston is now maintained and operated as a heritage railway by a team of volunteers as the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway. The British Seaman‚Äôs Boys' Home was founded in 1863 by William Gibbs of Tyntesfield for the orphan sons of deceased British seamen. It was closed in 1988 after 125 years. On 28 April 1967, a flying saucer reportedly hovered for 80 minutes over Brixham at an altitude of . = Maritime = Looking west across Brixham Harbour Brixham is also notable for being the town where the fishing trawler was improved in the 19th century; the distinctive red sails of the Brixham trawlers were coated with the local red ochre for protection. In the Middle Ages, Brixham was the largest fishing port in the south west of England. Known as the 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries', its boats helped to establish the fishing industries of Hull, Grimsby and Lowestoft. In the 1890s, there were about 300 trawling vessels in Brixham, most individually owned. The trawlers can still be seen coming in and out of the harbour, followed by flocks of seagulls. The fish market is open to the public on two special days in the summer, when the finer points of catching and cooking fish are explained. The modern boats are diesel-driven, but a few of the famous old sailing trawlers have been preserved. Owned by not for profit organisations and registered as historic vessels on the National Historic Ships register its possible to sail on these big wooden built, red sailed boats. They depend on income from guests to keep them sailing. Find Pilgrim of Brixham (1895) and Vigilance of Brixham (1926) moored in the harbour or sailing in the bay. Hundreds of ships have been wrecked on the rocks around the town. Brixham men have always known the dangers but even they were taken by surprise by a terrible storm that blew up on the night of 10 January 1866. The fishing boats only had sails then and could not get back into harbour because gale-force winds and the high waves were against them. To make things worse, the beacon on the breakwater was swept away, and in the black darkness they could not determine their position. According to local legend, their wives brought everything they could carry, including furniture and bedding, to make a big bonfire on the quayside to guide their men home. Fifty vessels were wrecked and more than one hundred lives were lost in the storm; when dawn broke, the wreckage stretched for nearly three miles up the coast. Brixham breakwater and lighthouse Hearing of this tragedy, the citizens of Exeter gave money to set up what became the Royal National Lifeboat Institution's Brixham Lifeboat in 1866. Now known as Torbay Lifeboat Station, it operates a all-weather lifeboat and a inshore lifeboat. The crews have a history of bravery, with 52 awards for gallantry. The boathouse can be visited and memorials to the brave deeds seen; on special occasions, visitors can go on board the boat. Two maroons (bangs) are the signal for the lifeboat to be launched. Smuggling was more profitable than fishing, but if the men were caught, they were hanged. There are many legends about the local gangs and how they evaded the Revenue men. One humorous poem describes how a notorious local character, Bob Elliott (\\"Resurrection Bob\\"), could not run away because he had gout and hid in a coffin. Another villain was caught in possession but evaded capture by pretending to be the Devil, rising out of the morning mists. On another occasion when there was a cholera epidemic, some Brixham smugglers drove their cargo up from the beach in a hearse, accompanied by a bevy of supposed mourners following the cortege drawn by horses with muffled hooves. The town's outer harbour is protected by a long breakwater, useful for sea angling. In winter, this is a site for purple sandpiper birds. To the south of Brixham, and sheltering the southern side of its harbour, lies the coastal headland of Berry Head with a lighthouse, Iron Age fort and national nature reserve. = Military = Golden Hind in Brixham harbour Warships have been seen in Torbay from the days of the Vikings, up until 1944 when part of the D-Day fleet sailed from here. In 1588, Brixham watched Sir Francis Drake attacking the Spanish Armada after he had (so the legend goes) finished his game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe. Today in Brixham harbour, there is a full-sized replica of the ship, the Golden Hind, in which Drake circumnavigated the globe; visitors can go on board. For centuries, ships going down the English Channel have come into Torbay to seek refuge from the storms and to replenish food supplies. Sometimes these were merchants, taking cargoes to faraway places and bringing back exotic goods and rare spices; sometimes they were carrying pilgrims, or gentlemen on the Grand Tour. Since the days of Henry VIII, Brixham has played a part in the defence of the nation. The headland known as Berry Head is now a national nature reserve, but it is also a military site where guns were once positioned to defend the naval ships that were re- victualling at Brixham. Twelve guns were put there during the War of American Independence, but were removed when peace came in 1783. Just ten years later, during a war with France, guns were again deployed around the town. The major position was at Berry Head, but this time fortifications were built to defend the gun positions. These can still be seen, and are now some of the best preserved Napoleonic forts in the country. During the long series of wars against the French that began in 1689 and lasted until 1815, the Royal Navy came into Brixham to get supplies of fresh vegetables, beef and water. There might have been twenty or so of the big men-o'-war lying at anchor in Torbay, recovering from exploits of the sort described in the books about Hornblower, Bolitho or Jack Aubrey. On the harbourside towards the marina, there is a grey stone building which today is the Coastguard headquarters; then, it was the King's Quay where His Majesty's vessels were provisioned. Local farmers brought vegetables to ward off scurvy, and cattle were slaughtered and their meat packed into barrels. The water came from a big reservoir situated near the crossroads in the middle of town; from there, a pipeline carried it under the streets and under the harbour to the King's Quay. Many of the well-known admirals of the day visited Brixham. Not only Nelson, but also Lord St. Vincent, Cornwallis, Hood, Rodney and Hawke. There was also Earl Howe, who earned the nickname of Lord Torbay because he spent so much time ashore in Brixham. A notorious visitor was Napoleon Bonaparte, who, as a prisoner on , spent several days off Brixham waiting to be taken to exile on St. Helena. Battery Gardens have a military history leading back to the Napoleonic wars and the time of the Spanish Armada. The emplacements and features seen here today are those of the Second World War and are of national importance. The site, listed by English Heritage, is recognised as one of the best preserved of its kind in the UK. Of the 116 'Emergency Coastal Defence Batteries' set up in the UK in 1940, only seven remain intact. During the Second World War, a ramp and piers were built on the breakwater, from which American servicemen left for the D-day landings. The 1969 Fleet Review was held in Torbay, to present new Sovereign's Colours to the Royal Navy. When the Fleet was lit up at night, \\"The Bay gave the impression that it had been filled with a completely new town: an amazing sight!\\" = Industrial = Apart from fishing, most of the other local industries were connected with stone. Limestone was once quarried and used to build the breakwater, for houses and roads, and was sent to Dagenham to make steel for Ford automobiles. It was also burnt in limekilns to reduce it to a powder which was spread on the land in other parts of Devon as an agricultural fertiliser. The old quarries and the limekilns can still be seen. Another mineral found in Brixham is ochre. This gave the old fishing boats their \\"Red Sails in the Sunset\\", but the purpose was to protect the canvas from sea water. It was boiled in great caldrons, together with tar, tallow and oak bark. The latter ingredient gave its name to the barking yards which were places where the hot mixture was painted on to the sails, which were then hung up to dry. The ochre was also used to make a paint. This was invented in Brixham in about 1845, and was the first substance in the world that would stop cast iron from rusting. Other types of paint were made here as well, and the works were in existence until 1961. There were iron mines at Brixham, and for a while they produced high-quality ore but the last one closed in 1925. Most of the sites have been built over and there are now few remains of this once-important industry save for the remnants of Sharkham Point Iron Mine.  Festivals and events  Brixham plays host to a number of festivals and events throughout the calendar year. These events are run entirely by locals and contribute significantly to the local economy. = Brixham Pirate Festival = The next annual Brixham Pirate Festival takes place over the early May Bank Holiday, 1‚Äì3 May 2021, and is known for its world record attempts, live music, free entertainment and for filling Brixham with pirates. The festival is a very large event in the town, with hundreds of residents viewing the festival yearly. = BrixFest = BrixFest is an annual family friendly festival in Brixham, that takes place in May each year, the next being scheduled for May 2021. = RNLI Lifeboat Week = Torbay has been served by lifeboats since 1866, and Brixham has provided the base for a lifeboat since then. The station was granted the Freedom of the Borough of Torbay in 1988. Torbay Lifeboat Station is based close to the breakwater, and this becomes the centre of a series of events planned by the local volunteers and sponsors. Taking place in August, events include the ‚ÄòWalk the Extra Mile‚Äô for the Lifeboat crew and the prize draw, guided tours of the All Weather Lifeboat, ‚ÄòBrixham has Talent‚Äô, with local school bands on the XRadio One Stage, and an evening ticket-only event ‚ÄòBands on the Beach‚Äô. = Fishstock Brixham = Fishstock Brixham is a one-day annual seafood and live music festival held in aid of the Fishermen's Mission (RNMDSF). It is a licensed event, organised by volunteers and held inside the new Fish Market Development on the harbour side. Normally the event is held on the second Saturday of September, but the date also varies for Spring tides. = Doddstock = Doddstock is a semi-annual music festival held in Astley Park in memory of local man, Julius Dodd.  Politics  On 1 April 2007, Brixham Town Council was established after a forty-year gap following Brixham Urban Council's disappearance. In its first meeting the council changed its name to Brixham Town Council per the Local Government Act 1972 and adopted the term chairman instead of Mayor to avoid confusion with the Torbay elected Mayor. The Council's duties are those of a standard English civil parish. Brixham is part of the UK parliamentary constituency of Totnes, whose MP has been Anthony Mangnall since 2019. The former British Prime Minister, James Callaghan was educated partly at Furzeham Primary School. Education Brixham has a number of schools, mostly located in the centre of residential areas. The town has one secondary school, Brixham College. Other schools and academies in Brixham and the surrounding area include * Eden Park Primary School Academy * Brixham Church of England Primary School * Saint Margaret Clitherow Catholic Primary School * Furzeham Primary School  Sport  Brixham is home to the Brixham Archers. This is the biggest archery club in the bay and shoots outdoors at their field at Churston. Brixham Archers also use an indoor facility in Brixham. The Archery club was formed in 1969 and has been successful at county and national level competitions. In 1874, Brixham Rugby Club was founded and became one of the founder members of Devon RFU of which six clubs are now left. They played Rugby on Furzeham Green until 1896 when they moved their present ground to New Gate Park (now Astley Park). The club will play their league fixtures in the National League 3 South West division of English rugby. Footballer Dan Gosling, of Bournemouth F.C., was born and raised in Brixham, and is the fourth-youngest player to have ever played for Plymouth Argyle aged 16 years and 310 days. Transport Brixham station entrance in 1964 Brixham railway station was the terminus of the Torbay and Brixham Railway. It served the town from the bay platform at Churston station until the line was closed in 1963. Some of the track bed remains in place. Houses in Harbour View Close were built on the site of the station. The Association of Train Operating Companies included Brixham as one of fourteen towns that, based on 2009 data, would benefit from a new railway service. This would be an extension of the Great Western Railway (GWR) service on the Riviera Line from as far as , which would then act as a railhead for Brixham. It would also serve other housing developments in the area since the opening of the steam railway, and may require the doubling of that line between Paignton and Goodrington Sands. Although Brixham is no longer on the rail network, frequent buses taking 25 minutes connect Brixham with the national rail network at Paignton, where the bus station is conveniently situated opposite the rail station. Trains from Paignton run to destiantions such as , London Paddington and . Torbay's flagship bus route, Stagecoach South West service 12 operates up to every 10 minutes and has its terminus at Brixham Town Square, with the service returning to Newton Abbot via Paignton, Torquay, and Kingskerswell. The service also calls at the Brixham Park and Ride site located on the A3022 (Dartmouth Road). Flat rate parking charges include a bus ride for a car's occupants to Brixham and return. Stagecoach services 18/18A take about 15 minutes for the journey from Brixham (Bank Street) to Kingswear, where a river crossing to Dartmouth can be made by ferry. Local town services operated by both Stagecoach and Country Bus, serve Furzeham, Wall Park, Sharkham, South Bay, Higher Brixham, Summercombe, and Hillhead. Following the withdrawal of evening services in March 2015 on Stagecoach's 17, 17A, and 18, Torbay Community Bus began running services 17E and 18E in the evenings to replace these routes. There are direct National Express coach services to London via Bristol and Heathrow Airport, and Sheffield via Bristol and Birmingham. Frequent ferry services for foot passengers operate to Torquay between the months of April and October, the fastest taking 35 minutes. There are also seasonal ferries to Paignton. Pleasure cruises also call at Brixham en route from Torquay to Dartmouth, during the spring, summer and autumn.

This term is used to describe the characteristic landscape in southern England where chalk is exposed at the surface. The name \\"downs\\" is derived from the Old English word dun, meaning \\"hill\\". Distribution The largest area of downland in southern England is formed by Salisbury Plain, mainly in Wiltshire. To the southwest, downlands continue via Cranborne Chase into Dorset as the Dorset Downs and southwards through Hampshire as the Hampshire Downs onto the Isle of Wight. To the northeast, downlands continue along the Berkshire Downs and Chiltern Hills through parts of Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and into Cambridgeshire. To the east downlands are found north of the Weald in Surrey, Kent and part of Greater London, forming the North Downs. To the southeast the downlands continue into West Sussex and East Sussex as the South Downs. Similar chalk hills are also found further north in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire where they are known as the Wolds. Geology The Chalk Group is a sequence of Upper Cretaceous limestones. The dominant lithology is relatively soft porous white chalk with only poorly-defined bedding. The chalk is classified as a biomicrite, with microscopic coccoliths and other fine-grained fossil debris in a matrix of micrite mud. Small amounts of silica were also deposited, mainly from sponge spicules, which moved during diagenesis and accumulated to form flints. The Chalk Group either directly overlies the impermeable uppermost Lower Cretaceous Gault Clay or permeable Upper Greensand Formation above the Gault Clay. Since its deposition, the chalk in southern England has been uplifted, faulted, fractured and folded by the distant effects of the Alpine Orogeny. The fracturing has greatly increased the chalk's permeability, such that it is a major aquifer. Sedimentary basins formed by rifting during the Triassic to Early Cretaceous were inverted during the Late Paleogene to Miocene leading to the formation of structures such as the Wealden Anticline and the Portland-Wight Monocline. Later erosion has produced the characteristic ridges of the downland landscape. The landscape was further modified during the Quaternary period by the area's proximity to the southern edge of the ice sheets formed during the last ice age. These periglacial effects included significant amounts of dissolution of the chalk and the modification of existing valleys due to a combination of frozen ground and snowmelt. Formation Downland develops when chalk rock becomes exposed at the surface. The chalk slowly erodes to form characteristic rolling hills and valleys. As the Cretaceous chalk layer in southern England is typically tilted, chalk downland hills often have a marked scarp slope on one side, which is very steep, and a much gentler dip slope on the other. Where the downs meet the sea, characteristic white chalk cliffs form, such as the White Cliffs of Dover and Beachy Head. Hydrology Chalk deposits are generally very permeable, so the height of the water table in chalk hills rises in winter and falls in summer. This leads to characteristic chalk downland features such as dry valleys or coombes, and seasonally-flowing streams or winterbournes. The practice of extracting water from this aquifer, in order to satisfy the increasing demand for water, may be putting some of these streams under stress. In the valleys below the downs at the base of the chalk layer, greensand or gault clay comes to the surface and at the interface at the top of the gault a springline can occur where water emerges from the porous chalk or the underlying greensand. Along this line, settlements and farms were often built, as on the higher land no water was available. This is demonstrated very clearly beneath the scarp of the White Horse Hills, above the Vale of White Horse. In many chalk downland areas there is no surface water at all other than artificially created dewponds. Soil The soil profile of chalk downland in England is a thin soil overlaying the parent chalk. Weathering of the chalk has created a characteristic soil known as rendzina. Unlike many soils in which there are easily distinguished layers or soil horizons, a chalk rendzina soil consists of only a shallow dark humus rich surface layer which grades through a lighter brown hillwash containing small pellets of chalk, to the white of the chalk itself. This is largely because of the purity of the chalk, which is about 98% calcium carbonate, and the consequent absence of soil-building clay minerals which are abundant, for example, in valley floors. Steep slopes on chalk downland develop a ribbed pattern of grass covered horizontal steps a foot or two high. Although subsequently emphasised by cattle and sheep walking along them, these terracettes (commonly known as sheep tracks) were formed by the movement of soil downhill, a process known as soil creep. Habitat Galium verum (L.) Lady's Bedstraw, a typical English chalk downland plant The dominant habitat in chalk downland is typically calcareous grassland, formed by grazing from both livestock and wild animals. Chalk downland is often unsuitable for intensive agriculture, horticulture, or development because of the nutrient- poor, shallow soil and difficult slopes. For this reason downland often survived uncultivated when other, more easily worked land was ploughed or reseeded. This shallow soil structure makes downland ecosystems extremely fragile and easy to destroy. With modern machinery and fertilising techniques, it has become possible to use some previously uncultivated downland for farming, and the decline of extensive grazing has meant that many areas of downland, neither cultivated nor grazed, revert to scrub or other less rare habitat, essentially destroying the delicate calcareous grassland. The UK cover of lowland calcareous grassland has suffered a sharp decline in extent since the middle of the twentieth century. There are no comprehensive figures, but a sample of chalk sites in England surveyed in 1966 and 1980 showed a 20% loss in that period and an assessment of chalk grassland in Dorset found that over 50% had been lost between the mid-1950s and the early 1990s. Much remaining chalk downland has been protected against future development to preserve its unique biodiversity.

It is located around east of Chester, west of Northwich and north west of Tarporley. The village is situated on Kelsall Hill, a part of the Mid-Cheshire Ridge, the broken line of sandstone hills that divide the west Cheshire Plain from its eastern counterpart. The ridge includes other hills including Peckforton, Beeston, Frodsham and Helsby. At the 2001 Census the population of Kelsall civil parish was 2,525, increasing to 2,609 at the 2011 census. The total population of the Kelsall local government ward, which also included the village of Ashton Hayes, was recorded as 3,439. This ward had been amalgamated with Tarvin by the time of the 2011 Census. The village contains two churches, one primary school, a community centre, a doctors' surgery, a chemist, a local store, a butchers shop, four public houses‚ÄîThe Boot*, The Farmers Arms, The Morris Dancer (formerly The Lord Binning) and The Royal Oak (previously The Oak)‚Äîa hotel (Willington Hall Hotel*), a farm shop (Willington Fruit Farm Shop*, a family-run business established over 50 years ago) and a nursing and residential home.

The ¬£3.82m, two-mile A54 bypass opened in October 1986.  KADRAS  Kelsall and District Rural Amenities Society (KADRAS) was formed in the late 1960s in order to stimulate public interest in the care and development of Kelsall's history, beauty and character. The society also aims to encourage the development of general public amenities and features of public interest in Kelsall. KADRAS achieves these goals by charitable means, and through lecturers, study groups, exhibitions and publications. Their magazine, entitled KADRAS is published every two months and encourages contributions from the community in the form of letters, articles and poetry. Geology =Bedrock geology= The western part of the parish (west of the Peckforton Fault) is underlain by the Wilmslow Sandstone Formation. East of the fault, the bedrock is largely Tarporley Siltstone with the underlying Helsby Sandstone occurring in some areas. =Superficial deposits= The lower ground in the west is largely covered by glacial till whilst higher ground in the east is free of superficial deposits. A small area of glacio-fluvial sands and gravels is mapped in the centre of the parish.

The O'Jays made their first chart appearance with \\"Lonely Drifter\\" in 1963, but reached their greatest level of success once Gamble & Huff, a team of producers and songwriters, signed them to their Philadelphia International label in 1972. With Gamble & Huff, the O'Jays (now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey) emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with \\"Back Stabbers\\" (1972), and topped the Billboard Hot 100 the following year with what some consider to be the first disco hit song, \\"Love Train.\\" Numerous other hits followed through the 1970s and into the 1980s and 1990s, and The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 and in 2013 they were inducted into National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame. Career The group was formed in Canton, Ohio, in 1958 while its members were attending Canton McKinley High School. Originally known as The Mascots, and then The Triumphs, the friends began recording with \\"Miracles\\" in 1961, which was a moderate hit in the Cleveland area. In 1963, they took the name \\"The O'Jays,\\" in tribute to Cleveland radio disc jockey Eddie O'Jay who was part of the powerful management team of Frankie Crocker, Herb Hamlett & Eddie O'Jay, (Toop, 1991). In 1963, The O'Jays released \\"Lonely Drifter,\\" their first national chart hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #93. Their debut album, released shortly thereafter was Comin' Through. Throughout the 1960s, they continued to chart with minor hits such as \\"Lipstick Traces,\\" (which they performed nationally on the ABC Television program, Shivaree), \\"Stand In For Love,\\" \\"Stand Tall,\\" \\"Let It All Out,\\" \\"I'll Be Sweeter Tomorrow,\\" \\"Look Over Your Shoulder,\\" \\"Deeper In Love With You,\\" and \\"One Night Affair.\\" However, while they issued dozens of singles throughout the decade, they never hit the US top 40 (although \\"Lipstick Traces\\" made it to #19 in Canada). On the R&B; charts, The O'Jays were somewhat more prominent, but their only top 10 R&B; single prior to 1972 was 1968's \\"I'll Be Sweeter Tomorrow.\\" In spite of their success as a touring group and on the R&B; charts, the group had been considering quitting the music industry in 1972. Around that time, original members Bill Isles and Bobby Massey departed, leaving the group a trio. The remaining three original members, Eddie Levert, William Powell, and Walter Williams, soldiered on and Gamble & Huff, a team of producers and songwriters with whom the O'Jays had been working for several years, signed them to their Philadelphia International label. Suddenly, The O'Jays' fortunes changed, and they finally scored with their first million-seller, \\"Back Stabbers,\\" from the album of the same name. This album produced several more hit singles, including \\"992 Arguments,\\" \\"Sunshine,\\" \\"Time To Get Down,\\" and the #1 pop smash, \\"Love Train.\\" During the remainder of the 1970s, the O'Jays continued releasing hit singles, including \\"Put Your Hands Together\\" (Pop #10), \\"For the Love of Money\\" (Pop #9), \\"Give the People What They Want,\\" \\"Let Me Make Love To You,\\" \\"I Love Music\\" (Pop #5), \\"Livin' for the Weekend,\\" \\"Message in Our Music,\\" and \\"Darlin' Darlin' Baby (Sweet Tender Love).\\" Original member William Powell died of cancer in 1977 at age 35. After adding Sammy Strain (born December 9, 1939) (of Little Anthony and the Imperials), the O'Jays continued recording, though with limited success. In 1978, the group released \\"Use ta Be My Girl,\\" which was their final Top-Five hit, though they continued placing songs on the R&B; charts throughout the 1980s. The O'Jays' success was not confined to the United States, as they also logged up nine hit singles in the United Kingdom between 1972 and 1983, including four tracks that reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. Their 1987 album, Let Me Touch You, was a breakthrough of sorts, and included the #1 R&B; hit \\"Lovin' You.\\" Though they continued charting on the R&B; charts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the O'Jays never again achieved pop success. In 1992, Sammy Strain left the group and returned to the Imperials. Strain's departure was filled by Nathaniel Best, who was later replaced by Eric Grant. Later in the 1990s, the group did little recording, though they remained a popular live draw. Their latest album was Imagination that was released in 2004. In 2003, the trio co-starred in the movie The Fighting Temptations, which starred Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyonc√© Knowles. In the film, they played three barbers with incredible vocal harmony who joined the local church choir to help out the film's protagonists: Darrin (Gooding) and Lilly (Knowles), who were the choir director and lead singer, respectively. In 2005, the O'Jays were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Original members Eddie Levert, Walter Williams, Bobby Massey and, posthumously, William Powell, were inducted. In a note of controversy, Sammy Strain was also inducted with the group, while original member Bill Isles was not. (Strain is one of the few artists in popular music history who is a double RRHOF inductee: with The O'Jays in 2005, and Little Anthony and the Imperials in 2009). In 2006, the O'Jays performed at the ESPY awards, hosted by Lance Armstrong. \\"For the Love of Money\\" was the theme song to the hit reality TV show The Apprentice, starring Donald Trump, and the group once performed the song live on the show. On February 23, 2007, Radio-Canada's website reported that Canadian Industry Minister, Jim Prentice, had used the song \\"For The Love of Money\\" without the group's permission during a political event, a faux pas since Prentice is responsible for the application of the Copyright Act in Canada. Radio-Canada also reported that Prentice has since been contacted by the attorneys for both the O'Jays and Warner/Chappell Music. On June 28, 2009, at the 2009 BET Award Show in the Shrine Auditorium the O'Jays were honored with BET's 2009 Life Time Achievement Award. Tevin Campbell, Trey Songz, Tyrese Gibson, and Johnny Gill performed a medley of the group's songs, followed by the presentation of the award by Don Cornelius. The group reminisced, joked with the audience, and accepted their award before performing renditions of their hit songs. On October 30, 2010, the group performed at Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington, D.C. In Cleveland, Ohio, on August 17, 2013, The O'Jays were inducted into The National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. The O'Jays are also two-time Grammy Hall of Fame Inductees for their songs \\"Love Train\\" (inducted 2006) and \\"For the Love of Money\\" (inducted 2016). On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed The O'Jays among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.
