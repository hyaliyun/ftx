It is assembled from unissued results of a single recording session at the studio of Rudy Van Gelder in Hackensack, New Jersey in 1958. Coltrane on tenor saxophone is accompanied by the Red Garland Trio with Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. With Garland and Chambers Coltrane had played together since at least October 1955 in Miles Davis' band. With Art Taylor they were part of the Tenor Conclave recordings in September 1956. As a quartet they had already recorded two albums for Prestige, John Coltrane with the Red Garland Trio and Soultrane. The material the quartet recorded on this session were extended interpretations of three popular songs not played by jazz musicians before, and \\"Little Melonae\\", a classic bebop tune written by Jackie McLean. Of note is Coltrane's use of the sheets of sound technique, particularly on Little Melonae. Release history As Coltrane's fame grew during the 1960s long after he had stopped recording for the label, Prestige used unissued recordings to create new marketable albums without Coltrane's input or approval. The original mono recordings were not remastered in stereo until 1970 and released on Prestige's \\"Jazz Classic Series\\" as Trane's Reign (PRT 7746). Original Jazz Classics reissued the album again in 1983 on LP, then followed by its first digitally remastered CD release in 1987.

Andrew Lang included it in The Lilac Fairy Book.Andrew Lang, \\"The Rich Brother and the Poor Brother\\", The Lilac Fairy Book Synopsis A rich old man with two sons, lost his wife. The older son lived with him and the younger son lived in the city. One day, the man learned that his older son had secretly married. The father turned him out, sent for his younger brother, and made him his only heir. He died and left his estate, which was not as good as it once was, to the younger son. The inheritance included some unfinished houses in the city. Meanwhile, the older brother and his wife lived in poverty. One day he begged his younger brother to give him the unfinished houses, and the brother agreed. The younger brother married a woman who was wealthy but greedy. One day she went to the city and saw the houses. She made her husband go to law again and again to get them back. Finally, they appeared before to the highest court. They stopped by a farm, where the resident farmer fed the rich brother and, grudgingly, permitted the poor brother to stay. The farmer's wife asked for one of the poor brother's onions, became ill during the night, and blamed the onion. The farmer beat the poor brother until the rich brother demanded that he go to court to complain and stop beating him. The rich brother and the farmer set out on horseback. The poor brother stayed to help a muleteer with his mule that was stuck in the mud. In spite of his help the muleteer went on without him. The poor brother decided he would never reach court in time, and that one way or another the case would go against him, so he might as well kill himself. But, it was too dark to be sure of it, so instead he went to sleep. In the morning, he jumped over a wall to kill himself, but he landed on top of an old man lying in the sun. The old man died. The old man's sons brought the poor brother to court. The three cases were brought against the poor brother, and the judge found in his favor in all of them, and ordered the accusers to pay for their false accusations.

It was used by the Puritans as a virtue name. An earlier form of the name, Caritas, was an early Christian name in use by Romans. Charity is also the usual English form of the name of Saint Charity, an early Christian child martyr, who was tortured to death with her sisters Faith and Hope. She is known as Agape in Biblical Greek and as Caritas in Church Latin and her name is translated differently in other languages. Faith, Hope and Charity, the three theological virtues, are names traditionally given to triplet girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for twin girls. One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in Texas and were recognized in 1994 by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's longest lived triplets.

He was a notable pioneer of African American business achievement in the early 20th century. Binga recalled coming to Chicago in the 1890s with $10 in his pocket. By the 1920s he was a bank president and major real estate owner. Unwilling to conform to de facto, private real-estate segregation, white real estate interests sometimes opposed him violently. After his bank failed in the Great Depression, Binga was eventually charged with embezzlement, a controversial prosecution in the African American community. Protests and public petitions helped lead to his early release. He was granted a full pardon in 1941. Early life Binga was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1865, the son of a barbershop owner and the youngest of ten children. He learned barbering, helped his mother to collect rents and made property repairs. He dropped out of high school to work in the office of Thomas Crispus, an African-American attorney. Despite business opportunities in Detroit he traveled westwards, employed in various jobs and cities. He made a profit from buying land on a former Indian reservation in Idaho. He arrived in Chicago in 1893 for the World's Columbian Exposition and remained, having various jobs and eventually starting a real estate business between 1896 and 1898.  Significance of City Influence  At the turn of the century less than 2% of the total population of Chicago was made up of African Americans, which is around 20,000 people. Most of which were densely populated in the \\"Black Belt\\" district, which covered a few blocks in each direction from State Street south 22nd Street to 35th Street. However, this was about to change as many African Americans began migrating to Northern cities due to the harsh prejudices of Jim Crow segregation, Ku Klux Klan persecution, and poor agricultural employment opportunities. The mass circulation of Chicago's popular African-American newspaper the \\"Chicago Defender\\", brought the city to the attention of those seeking promising occupations and inexpensive housing. It was these new migrants that made up the majority of Binga's early clientele. Realtor As a realtor he purchased run down properties which he repaired, renovated, and maintained himself. He was then able to rent them out at a premium due to the influx of African-Americans from the south. In 1905 he took out a long term lease on the Bates apartment building which resulted in the tenants who were all white, to leave. He expanded his business plan continuing to prosper to the point where he was able to consider opening a bank. Binga was known for philanthropy and was an honorary member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, but he was also described as a mean landlord to low income families by charging them the highest rents. Binga became even wealthier after his marriage to Eudora Johnson a relative of John \\"Mushmouth\\" Johnson, the city's gambling kingpin. When Johnson died in 1907, Eudora inherited $200,000 Eventually Binga and his wife bought a house at 5922 South Park Avenue, which is now known as King Drive. This was a strictly white neighborhood and his house and offices were bombed on at least five occasions. Binga shrugged off these attacks and became even more popular amongst African-Americans and continued to prosper, attaining around 1200 property leaseholds. The Binga Bank Binga founded a private bank in 1908, primarily for African-Americans, mainly because many banks excluded them. It was the first bank to be owned and run by African-Americans in the north. As the bank grew, other African- American businesses grew up around it and the area became the center of black business development on Chicago South side. When the Great Migration came, Binga grew ever more popular because he could provide a service to the black community where previously they had been discriminated against.Eventually Binga got a state charter for his bank and opened The Binga State Bank in 1921 which relocated to new imposing offices in 1924. Despite the bank's new status, he still remained the largest shareholder and his tendency to act impetuously was a personal trait that annoyed his board of directors and would come to play a part in his downfall. left The Depression In 1929 the US stock market collapsed and the Great Depression began. Despite the recession Binga completed the construction of a luxurious $325,000 five storey office block complete with a roof-top ballroom, known as the Binga Arcade. He had hoped that this investment would revitalize the area of 35th and State streets. However, this wasn't to be and it has been described as being built in the wrong place at the wrong time for financial success, relying too heavily on revenue from rental income. Binga was still outwardly full of confidence announcing his intention to start a new South Park National Bank, but his fortunes were about to change as he sought support to meet the bank's financial commitments. He was able to gain an offer of financial support, but State of Illinois officials required additional payments of $400,000 in cash. Binga then turned to the Chicago Clearing House Association to cover this amount as Binga State Bank was a member, but he was refused. Despite having solid assets, Binga was unable to liquidate these immediately as the banks assets were too heavily invested in mortgage loans to black churches and fraternal societies, many of which could not meet their payments after their members lost their jobs. Binga refused to seize the properties of these community institutions and in June 1930 the Auditor General of the State of Illinois closed the bank down. Binga lost his personal fortune as well as that of many depositors. Prison As soon as the bank was closed down, Binga's activities were investigated, leading to criminal charges. He was indicted in March 1931 for embezzlement. The prosecution argued that Binga took out inadequately secured loans to speculate in real estate, but his first trial in 1932 ended in a hung jury. He was then charged with depositing money that was intended for investment in a new bank, into his personal account and when he was tried a second time in 1933, he was found guilty. He was sentenced to ten years in prison and this caused resentment within his community who felt that racism was part of the Bank's failure. Clarence Darrow was Binga's attorney and although virtually retired, attempted to persuade a parole board hearing for his early release. He didn't succeed and it was nearly two years later that Binga was paroled from Joliet Prison to the custody of a catholic priest Rev Joseph F Eckert in 1938. Protests and a 10,000 signature petition from the community who themselves had suffered losses in his dealings, were considered a contributory factor in his release. Pardon and aftermath His wife had died in 1933 and on his release from prison, he was given a $15 a week job as a janitor at St. Anselm's Church, spending the remainder of his life in poverty. Binga always maintained his innocence in the affair and was given a full pardon by Gov. Dwight H. Green in 1941. He eventually went to live with his nephew and died June 13, 1950, in St Lukes Hospital. He was buried in Oak Woods Cemetery.  Further reading  *Don Hayner.

The technique was developed by Oklahoma Sooners coach Bud Wilkinson. Description The drill has several variations. The most common involves two players lined up three yards opposite one another. A corridor is set up typically using three blocking bags on each side of the players lined up top to bottom to create a wall, and the walls are spaced about one yard apart. This creates an area of about three feet by nine feet. The two players, at the sound of the whistle, then run at one another and the drill is over when one of the players is on the ground, or if a ball carrier is involved when he is tackled, or if the ball carrier runs out of bounds. If a player is able to drive the other player out of the corridor, that also ends the drill. In a variation, the ball carrier must keep running until they score a touchdown. Prevalence Many high school and college teams use the Oklahoma drill as a way to kick off the first day of full contact practice. While often criticized as excessive, some argue that it can be a critical tool used by coaches to evaluate players that might have looked good in non-contact drills, but have yet to face full contact. Other times the drill is used simply to get players in the proper mind-set for full contact practices, especially in high school and college, where many times players have gone up to eight months doing only non-contact drills. The Oklahoma drill, along with other full-contact drills, was officially banned from NFL team practices in May 2019 following years of declining use and increasing concerns for player safety. Veterans and high-profile NFL players rarely participate in pit drills owing to the higher risk of injury. Prior to the ban many team owners and coaches already refused to permit the drill. Notable exceptions had included the Chargers, and the Bengals who used the drill as a kind of celebration of the first day of full-contact practices. On October 7, 2015, Dan Campbell reportedly used the Oklahoma drill to begin his first practice as interim head coach of the Miami Dolphins. On July 29, 2018, the Detroit Lions used a reportedly safer variant of the Oklahoma drill during practice under first year head coach Matt Patricia.

At the age of 15, Hoedeman left school to work as a photograph retoucher in the printing industry in his native the Netherlands, but soon decided to try film. He first worked at Multifilm, a small production company in Haarlem, and then at Cinecentrum in Hilversum, where he worked in the optical and special effects department and helped out with camera, laboratory and sound work when he could. Hoedeman spent his evenings taking courses at the School of Fine Arts in Amsterdam and the School of Photography in The Hague. As his skills improved, he took on more complex work, including transitions and models, and eventually began designing, editing, and directing commercials. Hoedeman immigrated to Canada in 1965 with his then-wife, on the chance that the National Film Board of Canada might hire him. He showed up at the NFB with a reel of his previous work under his arm, and within days landed a job as a production assistant. His first major project there was an educational film called Continental Drift.Continental Drift (1968) - BCDB He then moved to the recently created French Animation Studio and made what he called his first \\"real\\" film, Oddball, in 1969.Co Hoedeman to share his passion for animationHuntington University Wanting to learn more about stop-motion animation techniques, he went to Czechoslovakia in 1970 to study puppet animation. On his return, he produced the innovative and charming children's film Tchou-Tchou (1972),Animators Unearthed - Co HoedemanAnimation World Network made entirely by using wooden blocks. Then, he made a series of animated films based on Inuit legends: The Man and the Giant, The Owl and the Lemming, The Owl and the Raven and Lumaaq. He collaborated closely with artists in the Arctic communities of Frobisher Bay (now called Iqaluit) and Povungnituk to illustrate the legends, using sealskin figures, soapstone carvings, and drawings. His next project was the very ambitious The Sand Castle / Le Ch√¢teau de sable, a touching fable that earned him the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 50th Academy Awards.Short Film Winners: 1978 Oscars1978Oscars.org This work, which featured an array of odd creatures created from foam rubber, wire, and sand, won numerous international awards and has proven to be an enduring favourite. Later works With every film, Hoedeman experimented with new techniques and materials, including papier-m√¢ch√©, paper cutouts, and computer animation. In 1992, Hoedeman collaborated with a group of Native and Inuit inmates at La Macaza Penitentiary in northern Quebec to make The Sniffing Bear / L'Ours renifleur, a cautionary tale about substance abuse.The Sniffing Bear (1992) - BCDB He followed that with another serious film, The Garden of √âcos / Le Jardin d'√âcos, an ecological fable that shows just how easy it is to upset the balance of nature.The Garden Of Ecos (1997) - BCDB In 1998, Hoedeman returned to his passion - making whimsical children's films - by crafting a series of four puppet films featuring Ludovic, a sweet young teddy bear, and his family. The Snow Gift (1998), A Crocodile in My Garden (2000), Visiting Grandpa (2001), and Magic in the Air (2002) were eventually released together on DVD under the title Four Seasons in the Life of Ludovic. His last film as an employee of the National Film Board was Mariannne's Theatre (2004), which he completed after learning that he and fellow animation pioneer Jacques Drouin would both be laid off just short of retirement, victims of budget cuts and the NFB's move toward hiring filmmakers on contract, rather than supporting full-time, permanent staff. Hoedeman now acts as an independent filmmaker and consultant working on several projects, including the production of an animated TV series based on his Ludovic films. Hoedeman is the subject of two documentary films: Nico Crama's Co Hoedeman, Animator (1980)Co Hoedeman, Animator (Film, 1980) - WorldCat.org and In the Animator's Eye: A Conjurer's Tales - Co Hoedeman (1996).In The Animator's Eye - A Conjurer's Tales - Co Hoedeman (1996) - BCDB Filmography *Continental Drift (1968) *Oddball (1969) *Matrioska (1970) *Tchou-tchou (1972) *The Owl and the Lemming: An Eskimo Legend (1971) *The Owl and the Raven: An Eskimo Legend (1973) *Lumaaq: An Eskimo Legend (1975) *The Man and the Giant: An Eskimo Legend (1975) *The Sand Castle / Le ch√¢teau de sable (1977) *The Treasure of the Grotoceans / Le tr√©sor des Grotoc√©ans (1980) *Masquerade (1984) *Charles and Fran√ßois (1988) *The Box / La Bo√Æte (1989) *The Sniffing Bear / L'Ours renifleur (1992) *The Garden of √âcos / Le jardin d'√âcos (1997) *Ludovic: The Snow Gift (1998) *Ludovic: A Crocodile in My Garden (2000) *Ludovic: Visiting Grandpa (2001) *Ludovic: Magic in the Air (2002) *Marianne's Theatre / Le th√©√¢tre de Marianne (2004) *Winter Days / The Poets of Winter Days (2003) *55 Socks (2011) Bibliography * Olivier Cotte (2007) Secrets of Oscar-winning animation: Behind the scenes of 13 classic short animations.

The Baltic Sea is crossed by several cruiseferry lines. Some important shipping companies are Viking Line, Silja Line, Tallink, St. Peter Line, Ecker√∂ Line and Birka Line. Eastern Baltic Upon departure from or arrival to Helsinki, Baltic sea cruiseferries pass the island fortress of Suomenlinna. Tallink and Viking Line operate competing cruiseferries on the routes Stockholm - Turku and Stockholm - Helsinki, calling in √Öland (Mariehamn or L√•ngn√§s). Additionally, Tallink sails Stockholm - Mariehamn - Tallinn and Stockholm - Riga. Tallink, Viking Line and Ecker√∂ Line compete on the Helsinki - Tallinn route, which is also the busiest route in the Baltic Sea, travelled by over 6 million people in 2008. , The busiest crossing. Baltic routes are mostly served by new ships purpose-built for the routes. Older cruiseferries from the Baltic serve as ferries on other seas, or in some cases, as cruise ships. Viking Line and Ecker√∂linjen also operate short routes from Sweden to √Öland, sailing on Kapellsk√§r - Mariehamn and Grisslehamn - Berghamn. Birka Line, owned by Ecker√∂, also operates short cruises out of Stockholm. Generally, GTS Finnjet of 1977 is considered to have been the first cruiseferry, she was the first ferry to offer cruise-ship quality services and accommodations, and the first generation of cruiseferries operating from Finland to Sweden were highly influenced by Finnjet's interior and exterior designs. After the fall of the Soviet Union the route connecting Helsinki to Tallinn became highly lucrative, which led to Estonia-based company Tallink to grow and rival the two long- established companies (Viking Line and Silja Line). Eventually, Tallink purchased Silja Line in 2006. The size of Baltic cruiseferries is limited by various narrow passages in the Stockholm, √Ölandian and Turku archipelagos, meaning ships not much in excess of 200 meters cannot traffic on these routes. The single narrowest point is Kustaanmiekka strait outside Helsinki, although ships making port at the city's west harbour do not have to pass through the strait. Viking and Silja Line have wished to keep their terminals in the South Harbour, however, as it is located right next to the city center. The longest ships to maintain scheduled service through the Kustaanmiekka strait were MS Finnstar and her sisters with a length of 219 meters. The longest ship to have ever navigated through the narrows past Suomenlinna sea fortress was MS Oriana (260 m), but that was only possible due to extremely good weather conditions. =Tax-free sales= To allow for duty-free sales on routes between Finland and Sweden, Baltic Sea cruiseferries stop at the √Öland Islands on the way. This often happens in the middle of the night, and the ships stay at the √Öland Islands for less than an hour. Passengers board and depart the ships via walking tunnels connecting the ship directly to the terminal building. The expansion of the European Union has limited the growth of the industry as duty-free sales on intra-EU routes are no longer possible. However, as the √Öland Islands are outside the EU customs zone, duty-free sales are still possible on routes making a stop at Mariehamn or other harbours on the islands. Another popular destination is Estonia with its lower taxes on alcohol. The ferries have been criticized because of the low prices of alcoholic beverages which encourage passengers to become drunk and act irresponsibly. Due to the relatively cheap price of the cruises and availability of duty-free alcohol (which makes it considerably cheaper than on \\"land\\" as both Finland and Sweden have a relatively strict taxation of alcohol) many big parties involving vast amounts of alcohol consumption are held on the ships.Silja Line: Special Cruises (Swedish) Many Finns also buy snus from ferries as its sale is illegal in Finland due to EU regulations.

Discovered in 1908 in the United States near Lusk, Wyoming, it was the first dinosaur specimen found to include a skeleton encased in skin impressions from large parts of the body. It is ascribed to the species Edmontosaurus annectens (originally known as Trachodon annectens), a hadrosaurid (\\"duck-billed dinosaur\\"). The mummy was found by fossil hunter Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his three sons in the Lance Formation. Although Sternberg was working under contract to the British Museum of Natural History, Henry Fairfield Osborn of the AMNH managed to secure the mummy. Osborn described the fossil in detail in 1912, coining the name \\"dinosaur mummy\\" for it‚Äîseveral dinosaur mummies of similar preservation have been discovered since then. This specimen has considerably influenced the scientific conception of hadrosaurids. Skin impressions found in between the fingers were once interpreted as interdigital webbing, bolstering the now-rejected perception of hadrosaurids as aquatic animals, a hypothesis that remained unchallenged until 1964. Today, the mummy is considered one of the most important fossils of the AMNH. The mummy was discovered lying on its back, its neck twisted backwards and its forelimbs outstretched. The skeleton is complete save the tail, hind feet, and the hind portion of the pelvis. All bones are preserved unflattened and still connected to each other. Almost two-thirds of the skin is preserved. Delicate for the size of the animal, the skin includes two different types of non-overlapping scales that were between in diameter. In contrast with other similar dinosaur mummies, the skin of AMNH 5060 was tightly attached to the bones and partially drawn into the body interior, indicating that the carcass dried out before burial. The specimen would thus constitute the fossil of a natural mummy. After dehydration, the mummy likely would have been rapidly buried by a meandering river, with bacteria consolidating the surrounding sediments, resulting in its excellent preservation.  Discovery  Only known photograph of the mummy's excavation, Wyoming, 1908 The mummy was discovered and excavated in 1908 by Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his three sons George, Charles Jr. and Levi. An independent fossil collector, Sternberg earned a living by selling his finds to museums in North America and Europe. The sons worked as assistants for their father, and later became renowned paleontologists. Early in 1908, Sternberg planned an expedition to the Lance Creek area in eastern Wyoming, where the family had not worked before. In search of acquirers of potential fossil finds, he wrote to the British Museum of Natural History that he knew where in Wyoming to find a skull of the horned dinosaur Triceratops, knowing that the museum was lacking a good specimen; the museum agreed to buy any good fossil finds if such were made. The Sternbergs left their family residence in Kansas in early spring, and arrived in the Lance Creek area in July. Sternberg's plan foresaw the exploration of an uninhabited area of approximately north to the North Platte River and south to the Cheyenne River in Converse County (today Niobrara County). The predominant badlands of this area expose sedimentary rocks of the Maastrichtian stage of the Upper Cretaceous, which today are known as the Lance Formation. The area had already been intensively explored by paleontological expeditions; before the start of his expedition, Sternberg learned that the American Museum of Natural History had been unsuccessfully working in the area for years. Although the party was enthusiastic (Sternberg's sons had never discovered dinosaur fossils before), the first weeks of search were unsuccessful. Sternberg wrote in his 1909 book The Life of a Fossil Hunter: At the end of August, Sternberg finally discovered a fossil horn weathering out of the rock; subsequent excavation revealed a long Triceratops skull. Soon after, George, the oldest son, found bones sticking out of the rock while prospecting new territory with Levi, the youngest son. Levi discovered more bones nearby, apparently belonging to the same skeleton. By then, the group had travelled from their base camp, and food was running short. Sternberg instructed George and Levi to carefully remove the sandstone above the skeleton, and Sternberg himself set off for Lusk with Charles Jr. to purchase new supplies and to initiate the shipping of the Triceratops skull to the British Museum. The third day after their father's departure, George and Levi recognized that they had found an apparently complete skeleton lying on its back. When removing a large piece of sandstone from the chest region of the specimen, George discovered, to his surprise, a perfectly preserved skin impression. In 1930, George remembered: The mummy on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History (2008) When Sternberg finally returned at the fifth day, George and Levi had run out of food, and had eaten only potatoes for the last two days. Nevertheless, they had exposed the skeleton; the dig measured in width, in length and in depth. When paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, manager of the American Museum of Natural History, learned about the new find, he immediately sent staff member and paleontologist Albert Thomson, to attempt to secure it for the museum. Osborn knew about the agreement between Sternberg and the British Museum, which gave the latter rights to acquire any of the finds; he appealed to Sternberg's patriotism and promised permanent exhibition of the fossil. When Thomson arrived, he was unable to evaluate the fossil as it had already been wrapped in burlap and shellac for transport, yet the asking price of $2,000 () was high. On the same day as Thomson, William Jacob Holland, director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, arrived at Lusk. Osborn, now worried about losing his opportunity, quickly acquired the specimen for an unknown sum. At the American Museum, preparation of the skin impressions was completed by preparator Otto Falkenbach. Subsequently, the mummy was scientifically described by Osborn himself and the famous paleontologist Barnum Brown in three articles published in 1911 and 1912, and afterwards was put on display. In the exhibition, the mummy, protected by a glass showcase, is shown lying on its back as it was discovered; the museum decided not to restore missing parts. Today, the mummy is regarded as one of the museum's most important fossils. It is cataloged under the specimen number AMNH 5060.  Significance and classification  The mummy in bottom view, with outline drawing AMNH 5060 is considered one of the best preserved dinosaur fossils ever discovered. The scientific value of the mummy lies in its exceptionally high degree of preservation, the articulation of the bones in their original anatomical position, and the extensive skin impressions enveloping the specimen. In 1911, Osborn concluded: As dinosaur skin impressions were previously known only from a few fragments, the mummy became a paleontological sensation. As noted by Osborn in 1912, the famous holotype specimen of Trachodon mirabilis (AMNH 5730), found in 1884 by Jacob Wortman, originally also contained extensive skin impressions, but most had been destroyed during excavation, leaving only three fragments from the tail region. As explained by Osborn, the very thin layer containing the skin impressions in the stone is difficult to detect, and many such impressions might have been lost in previous years as they were not expected nor recognized by excavators. alt=Photograph of part of the skin impression of the shoulder region In his 1911 description, Osborn coined the term \\"dinosaur mummy\\" for the specimen. This term was later used by some authors to refer to a handful of similar hadrosaurid (\\"duck-billed dinosaurs\\") specimens with extensive skin impressions, all of which have been discovered in North America. The second such mummy, now in the Naturmuseum Senckenberg in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was discovered by the Sternbergs in 1910, just two years after the discovery of AMNH 5060. Although the skeleton of the Senckenberg mummy is more complete, it is less well preserved than AMNH 5060. Another mummy specimen was discovered by Barnum Brown 1912 in Alberta, Canada, and subsequently described as the new genus Corythosaurus. Yet another mummy was discovered by Sternberg, which he sent to the British Museum during World War I. The transport ship, the SS Mount Temple, was sunk by a German raider ship in 1916, resulting in the loss of the mummy as well as many other fossils discovered by Sternberg. After these initial finds, no more mummy specimens were discovered until 2000, when a Brachylophosaurus mummy nicknamed \\"Leonardo\\" was discovered in the Judith River Formation of Montana. Another Edmontosaurus mummy, nicknamed \\"Dakota\\", was excavated from the Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota in 2006. Gregory S. Paul, in 1987, stated that the life appearance of Edmontosaurus and Corythosaurus can be more accurately restored than that of any other dinosaur thanks to the well-preserved mummy specimens. Yet, evidence provided by AMNH 5060 was not regularly taken into account by paleoartists, possibly because it was described before World War I, during which activity in dinosaur research abated, only to be revitalized in the mid 1960s. AMNH 5060 belongs within the Hadrosauridae, a family of ornithischian (\\"bird-hipped\\") dinosaurs. Barnum Brown initially identified the mummy as Trachodon annectens. At the time, the genus Trachodon encompassed nearly all known hadrosaurid specimens. Since 1942, the mummy was referred to the species Anatosaurus copei, which in 1990 was placed within its own genus, Anatotitan. Anatotitan copei is now regarded as a synonym of Edmontosaurus annectens by most researchers. The majority of dinosaur skin impressions are referable to the Hadrosauridae. In North American specimens from the Maastrichtian age, skin impressions are 31 times more abundant in association with hadrosaurid specimens than with any other group. The reasons for this distribution is unclear. Of all known hadrosaurid skin impressions, 25% belong Edmontosaurus.  Description and interpretation  alt=Photograph and interpretive drawing of a region at the back of the skull showing bones and skin impressions Most of the skeleton is preserved, the bones still attached to each other in their original anatomical position. The tail, hind feet, and hind portion of the pelvis had eroded away before the mummy was discovered. Fossils often become flattened during fossilization, but AMNH 5060 is preserved three-dimensionally, without significant deformation. The specimen was found lying on its back, with head and neck twisted upwards, backwards, and to the right side of the body. Both knees are drawn forwards, while the forelimbs are outstretched. Although the tail curves upwards and forwards over the body in many dinosaur skeletons, it was probably straight in the mummy as movement would have been restricted by . Almost two-thirds of the total skin area is preserved, often with excellent preservation. The skin impressions are pressed tightly onto the bones, and are partially drawn into the body in between the bones. When discovered, skin impressions probably encased the whole skeleton, but were partially destroyed while freeing it from the surrounding rocks. Skin impressions are preserved on the forelimbs, neck and throat, and the chest, as well as on the right side of the trunk. As well as the skin impressions, Sternberg noted the preservation of muscle impressions. In 2007, paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter suggested that even impressions of inner organs are possibly preserved; this cannot be evaluated without detailed computer tomography and x-ray analyses. = Skin = Drawing of skin impressions from the underside of the trunk The skin was thin and delicate in relation to the size of the animal. As typical for dinosaurs, the skin consisted of non-overlapping scales called tubercles. Two sorts of tubercles can be distinguished. Evenly distributed on the skin were the \\"ground tubercles\\", which were small, rounded scales between in diameter. The larger \\"pavement tubercles\\", less than in diameter, were pentagonal in shape, raised relative to the ground tubercles, and arranged in irregular clusters interrupting the surface formed by the lower ground tubercles. These clusters consisted of between twenty and several hundred individual pavement tubercles, and were bordered by intermediate tubercles which mediated in size and shape between ground and pavement tubercles. In the chest and abdominal region, clusters were small, oval in shape and arranged in irregular longitudinal lines. They became larger towards the sides of the trunk, where they reached in diameter; their shape became more irregular. The largest clusters could be found above the pelvis and measured in diameter; clusters of similar size were presumably present along the whole back of the animal. Muscles and joints were generally occupied with smaller tubercles to enable greater flexibility‚Äîlarger tubercles are found in those parts that are tightly pressed to the bones. The largest surviving scales are found on the outer side of the arms; these polygonal tubercles were up to in diameter. The inner side of the arms was completely covered by small tubercles. The thigh also showed relatively small tubercles on the inner side; no impressions of the outer side are preserved. A patch of skin is also present in the nostril region of the snout; these scales measured in diameter. = Skin frill = alt=Photograph and interpretive drawing of a part of the neck region of the mummy Above the neck vertebrae, a long and deep skin impression is preserved. Osborn interpreted this impression as part of an ornamental frill of loose skin that extended along the midline of the neck and back. Osborn noted that this frill was folded above the vertebral joints to ensure mobility of the neck, giving the comb a ruff-like appearance. The areas in-between the folded areas were occupied by an oval cluster of pavement tubercles. Osborn observed that the upper edge of the comb had been destroyed during the recovery of the mummy, so that the height of the crest can no longer be determined. He assumed that the frill would have extended upwards by at least one further row of clusters. An Edmontosaurus fossil described by the paleontologist John Horner in 1984 shows a regular row of rectangular lobes in the tail area. Stephen Czerkas, in 1997, argued that this row would likely have extended over much of the body, including the neck, making a frill of loosely folded skin seem unlikely. Instead, the skin impression described by Osborn would have come from the fleshy crest above the downward-curved neck spine. This neck crest would have been much deeper than previously assumed, connecting the base of the head to the shoulder region. The observed folding would have been a consequence of mummification and caused by a withered nuchal ligament. = Hand = AMNH 5060 allowed for the first accurate reconstruction of the hand skeleton of a hadrosaurid. Barnum Brown, in 1912, showed that the carpus of the mummy did not consist of two complete rows of ossified carpals, as Othniel Charles Marsh had assumed in his reconstruction of 1892, but that only two ossified carpals were present. In the mummy, these elements lie directly above each other and above the third metacarpal. This arrangement probably reflects the original position in the living animal since both hands show the same arrangement. Brown further pointed out that the first finger was missing and the second to fifth fingers each consisted of three phalanges. Marsh had reconstructed the first finger as a reduced element with only two phalanges, while the fifth finger was absent in his reconstruction. Drawing of the upper- (left) and underside (right) of the right hand, showing the metacarpal bones and fingers enclosed by the skin cover. The fingers of the mummy are partially connected to each other by an envelope of skin impressions. In 1912, Osborn suggested that this skin envelope represented webbing between fingers and that the forelimb would have functioned as a paddle, which he considered a clear indication of an aquatic lifestyle for Trachodon (= Edmontosaurus) and presumably other representatives of the Trachodontidae (= Hadrosauridae). The webbing would not only have connected the fingers with each other, but would also have extended up to beyond the fingertips. Furthermore, Osborn noted the lack of clearly pronounced hooves and large fleshy foot pads on the forelimb‚Äîfeatures to be expected in a primarily land-dwelling animal. With the Senckenberg mummy, another Trachodon specimen with supposed webbing was discovered in 1910. A possible aquatic lifestyle of hadrosaurids had been proposed before, in particular based on the great depth and flat sides of a well-preserved tail discovered by Brown in 1906. This hypothesis appeared to be in accordance with an 1883 account by Edward Drinker Cope describing hadrosaurid teeth as \\"slightly attached\\" and \\"delicate\\", and therefore suitable for feeding on soft aquatic plants. It was only after the discovery of the two mummies that the hypothesis of an aquatic lifestyle became the undisputed doctrine. Charles H. Sternberg wrote in 1917: reconstruction of Trachodon (Edmontosaurus) drawn by Charles R. Knight under supervision of Henry Fairfield Osborn. The fingers are shown to be joined into a paddle, as was inferred from the apparent interdigital webbing seen in the mummy. It was not until 1964 that John H. Ostrom voiced doubts about the webbed-finger hypothesis. Ostrom was able to show that hadrosaurids did not feed on soft aquatic plants as previously assumed, but that their elaborate chewing apparatus was designed to crush resistant plant material such as conifers. The skeletal anatomy would furthermore indicate a highly specialized two-legged locomotion on land. Ostrom noted that hadrosaurids showed no osteoderms or similar structures to defend against predators that are found in many other herbivorous dinosaurs, and suggested that the webs may have been used to allow escape into the water in case of danger. Robert Bakker, in 1986, argued that the animal had no webs, and that the skin between its fingers was the remnant of a fleshy pad enveloping the hand that had dried out and flattened during mummification. Very similar skin structures originating from foot pads can be found on modern-day mummified camel carcasses. Furthermore, Bakker argued that the fingers were short and could hardly have been spread apart, which distinguishes them fundamentally from the long, spread toes of today's paddling animals such as ducks. Bakker concluded: Today, the webbing hypothesis is widely refuted. Phil Senter, in 2012, examined AMNH 5060 and several other hadrosaurid specimens to reconstruct the orientation of the hand. While trackway evidence indicates that the palm was directed inwards and only slightly backwards, many hadrosaurid skeletons have instead been mounted with the palm of the hand facing backwards. In such reconstructions, the radius either crosses the ulna (instead of being parallel) or connects to the inner of the two condyles of the humerus (instead of to the outer). Although the palms of the mummy face backwards, this is because the carcass lay on its back, which caused the forelimbs to sprawl and the humeri to detach from the shoulder joints. In both forelimbs of the mummy, radius and ulna are parallel to each other and the radius is connected to the outer condyle, confirming that the palm must have faced inwards in life. = Ossified tendons and stomach contents = In 1909, Charles H. Sternberg noted that hundreds of ossified tendons were preserved along the dorsal spine, each about as thick as a pencil. Sternberg speculated that these tendons served as defensive structures and could not be penetrated by the claws of predatory dinosaurs such as the contemporary Tyrannosaurus. Today it is known that these tendons stiffened the spine, probably to counteract bending forces on the spine during walking. Although the tail is not preserved in the mummy, other Edmontosaurus specimens show that it had also been stiffened by such tendons. Sternberg also reported carbonized food remains discovered in the stomach region of the mummy. An analysis of these remains has not yet been performed. Kr√§usel, in 1922, investigated a concretion of brown plant material in the Senckenberg mummy that consisted mainly of branches and needles of conifers. In both mummies, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the plant material was washed into the abdominal cavity only after the death of the animal. = Attempts to reconstruct color patterns = Modern reconstruction of Edmontosaurus annectens Osborn observed in 1912 that clusters of \\"pavement tubercles\\" were more numerous on the upper sides of the trunk and limbs than on the underside. Consequently, they would dominate in areas that would have been exposed to the sun when the animal was alive; in many reptiles living today, these sun-exposed areas contain the most pigment. From these observations, Osborn hypothesized a connection between pigmentation and scaling: the \\"pavement tubercle\\" clusters might have represented dark-colored areas on a bright base; the irregular distribution of the clusters would indicate an irregular color pattern; and the most elaborate color pattern would be present on the skin frill of the neck. Osborn did admit that in today's lizards the distribution of pigments is largely independent of the type of scaling. Catherine Forster, in 1997, stated that color information can in principle not be derived from the skin impressions of dinosaur mummies. In 2015, Philip Manning and colleagues concluded that skin in dinosaur mummies is not simply preserved as an impression but contains original biomolecules or their derivatives. These researchers inferred the presence of melanin pigments in the skin of another Edmontosaurus mummy nicknamed Dakota. While clarifying that a reconstruction of the coloration is currently not possible given the many different factors that influence coloration, they remarked that the melanin distribution may potentially allow for deriving a monochrome (black- and-white) picture of the animal's pigmentation pattern. Any chemical analysis of AMNH 5060 would be problematic, however, as consolidating chemicals have been applied to its skin for preservation. = Nostrils = Senckenberg mummy (on exhibition in the Naturmuseum Senckenberg in Frankfurt am Main, Germany) As in other Edmontosaurus specimens, the sides of the snout were excavated by a large and elongated depression, the circumnarial depression, which housed the nostrils. As confirmed by AMNH 5060, the would not have occupied the entire depression. Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright, in a 1942 publication, suggested that skin impressions are preserved within the depression; a deepening in this possible skin in the front part of the depression could mark the position of the fleshy nostrils. This skin is smooth and wrinkled and tubercles are absent, in contrast with the rest of the body. Accordingly, paleoart often shows the remainder of the depression being occupied by a scaleless, inflatable bladder. In 2015, however, Albert Prieto-M√°rquez and Jonathan Wagner found low and subtle impressions of polygonal scales in the frontmost part of the depression behind the beak. These scales suggest that the rest of the skin that once covered the depression might have been scaly. For this reason, these authors preferred an older interpretation by James A. Hopson from 1975, who proposed a scaly bladder with brightly colored skin between the scales which became visible only when the bladder was inflated. Prieto-M√°rquez and Wagner further suggested that sedimentary ridges within the depression likely represent former soft-tissue structures. The rear edge of the bony nostril was extended towards the front by a flange which was probably a cartilaginous structure, indicating that the rear part of the bony nostril was covered by soft tissue, forming a nasal cavity. As this covering was apparently restricted to the rear part, it is likely that the opening of the nasal passage into the skull interior would also have been situated there. A ridge running diagonally across the depression might have been a cartilaginous septum supporting a nasal cavity. The ridge ends in the lower front of the depression, which is the most likely location for the fleshy nostril. The nasal cavity that this ridge once supported would therefore have been the main nasal air passage.  Taphonomy  Thorax region of the mummy showing skin impressions that tightly adhere to the bones Several authors discussed the question of how the animal died and what circumstances led to its exceptionally good preservation. Charles H. Sternberg, in 1909, and Charles M. Sternberg, in 1970, assumed that the animal died in water. The gases accumulating in the abdomen after death would have floated the carcass, with the belly pointing upwards and the head moving into its final position under the shoulder. The carcass would then have sunk to the bottom to come to rest on its back, and become covered by sediments. The skin would have been drawn into the body cavity by the load of the sediments or due to the escape of the gases. Osborn suggested another scenario in 1911: the animal could have died a natural death, and the carcass would have been exposed to the sun for a longer time in a dry riverbed, unaffected by scavengers. Muscles and intestines would have completely dried out and thus shrunk, whereby the hard and leathery skin sank into the body cavity and finally adhered tightly to the bones, forming a natural mummy. At the end of the dry season, the mummy would have been hit by a sudden flood, transported a distance and quickly covered with sediments at the embedding site. The fine grain size of the sediment (fine river sand with sufficient clay content) would have led to the perfect impressions of the filigree skin structures before the hardened skin could soften. Today Osborn's hypothesis is considered the most probable. Aerial photograph of a meandering river, showing the sliding slopes (sand point bar) on the inside and the impact slopes (cutbank) on the outside of the river loops The cause of death of the specimen can only be speculated about. Kenneth Carpenter, in 1987 and 2007, considered starvation during a drought to be the most likely cause of death, given the similarity of the mummy to cadavers of today's animals found during droughts. The loss of muscle mass due to malnutrition could also partly explain why the mummy's skin was sunken around the bones. Furthermore, the carcass was not affected by scavengers. This could have been due to a drought keeping scavengers away from the affected area or leading to the accumulation of many carcasses that could not all be handled by the existing scavengers, as can be observed during modern droughts. Furthermore, Carpenter noted that today's large even-toed ungulates are closely bound to water during droughts to prevent overheating. The main cause of death of these animals during droughts is starvation, not thirst. The mummy was discovered in river sediments; therefore the animal likely died near a river or at least a dry riverbed. The sediments of the discovery site were deposited by a meandering river. This type of river constantly migrates its riverbed by eroding the cut bank (the bank on the outside of the river bends) and depositing sediment on the slip-off slope (on the inside of the bends). A slip-off slope forms a characteristic sediment sequence known as a point bar. Carpenter concluded from a photograph taken during the excavation that the mummy was discovered within such a point bar, and suspected that the carcass was embedded during flood events after the end of a drought. The carcass would have been an obstacle for the current, resulting in its rapid burial: as water flowed around the carcass, its velocity would have increased, leading to a removal of sediment. The carcass would have successively sunk into the resulting depression. Additional sediment that led to further burial would have originated from cut banks collapsing into the river further upstream, which is indicated by the high clay content of the sandstones. The sediment load carried by the river would have been deposited as current velocity, and thus carrying capacity, diminished, which is the case at the end of a flood. The carcass would have been embedded within hours or days. The taphonomic processes that affected the mummy after its burial are difficult to reconstruct as samples from the surrounding sedimentary rocks do not exist. Probably a slow bacterial decay of the carcass was initiated first. Carpenter emphasized that the excellent preservation of the fossil was made possible only by minerals formed by bacteria (biomineralization). These minerals would have solidified the clay-rich sand surrounding the mummy, resulting in its unusual three-dimensional preservation. At the same time, this solidified sediment would have preserved the skin impressions at the contact surface between sand and cadaver. The mineralization furthermore anchored the bones in their anatomical position and thus prevented them from falling apart as the soft tissue decayed. Important minerals formed after burial would include calcium carbonate (calcite) and iron carbonate (siderite); the latter, after being oxidized to limonite, would have been responsible for the rusty color of the mummy. After the more or less complete decomposition of the soft tissue, a cavity remained in the cemented sediment that was subsequently filled with sand, together with the skin impression it contained.

A single series of ten episodes were broadcast, typically at 8:30pm on Thursdays, with episodes repeatedly on Fridays at 1:50pm as part of the channel's daytime schedule. The series was produced in-house by the BBC under the BBC Worldwide moniker. The series follows ensemble cast of various Crown Prosecutors, who bring cases before local magistrates in the United Kingdom. The series stars Tom Chadbon, David Daker, Deborah Grant, Jessica Stevenson, Paris Jefferson, Shaun Parkes and Michael Praed. The series was noted at the time as being the first series to regularly examine the lives of modern British Crown prosecutors. While lawyers \\"for the prosecution\\" had been seen on British television, these were depictions of a different era in British jurisprudence. Throughout the bulk of 20th century, in most parts of England and Wales, prosecution of criminal cases was handled by the police or, in some cases, an entity directly attached to the Home Office. Crown Prosecutor was thus the first serious examination of what it was like to work in the Crown Prosecution Service, a completely police-independent body, which itself had only been established in 1985. The series has not been repeated since its original broadcast, however a single surviving episode is available to watch on YouTube. Structure Each episode generally featured a primary plot centred on an unfolding court case, along with two subplots that advanced the development of the show's cast of characters. Sometimes the subplots involved other, typically less serious, court cases‚Äîsuch as the vandalism charges brought against people who ate a chocolate sculpture in episode seven. But these subplots often were entirely outside the courtroom and served to reveal different facets of the prosecutor's lives. Sticky living arrangements, new romance, old flames, and professional temptation were all featured in the series. Though these plots allowed viewers a glimpse into the prosecutors' lives to a much greater degree than would be possible on the somewhat comparable Law & Order, the character development never expanded to the level of a soap opera. This was in part because Crown Prosecutor had a notably unusual run-time, compared with other legal dramas of its era. Episodes were 30 minutes long, shorter by 12 to 15 minutes than many courtroom dramas which ran on commercial television in 1995. Despite this shorter format, a resolution to all of the primary plots, and most of the secondary ones were given by the end of each episode.

In later years, Botkina, along with her brother Gleb Botkin, was a major supporter of Anna Anderson's claim that she was the surviving Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. Early life Botkina was the third child and only daughter of Botkin and his wife Olga. Her parents divorced in 1910 under the strain of Dr. Botkin's devotion to the royal family and the long hours he spent at court and her mother's affair with a German tutor. Eugene Botkin retained custody of the children following the divorce.Zeepvat, Charlotte, Romanov Autumn, Sutton Publishing, 2000 Botkina's older brother Dmitri was killed in action during World War I.King, Greg, and Wilson, Penny, The Fate of the Romanovs, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2003, , p. 62 The Botkin children \\"were not intimate friends\\" of the imperial children, Botkina later recalled, but they did know them fairly well. They first met the imperial children in 1911 and, thereafter, sometimes played with them when they were on vacation in the Crimea.Kurth, Peter, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson, Back Bay Books, 1983, p. 138 Botkina also chatted on occasion with the younger grand duchesses during World War I, when Botkina served as a Red Cross nurse at a hospital in the Catherine Palace.Kurth, p. 138 Revolution Botkina and her brother accompanied their father into exile with the Romanov family following the Russian Revolution of 1917. When the family was transferred from Tobolsk to Ekaterinburg, the Botkin children were not permitted to accompany their father.Kurth, p. 139 When Botkina asked Ural Soviet commander Nikolai Rodionov for permission to join her father at Ekaterinburg, he replied, \\"Why should such a handsome girl as you are want to rot all her life in prison, or even to be shot?\\" Botkina insisted that the imperial family would not rot in prison. Rodionov told her they would probably be shot instead. He told her he would allow them to accompany the group as far as the Ekaterinburg station, but they would be arrested and sent back to Tobolsk because he would not grant them an entry permit to live in Ekaterinburg. In the end, the Botkin children decided to remain behind in Tobolsk.King and Wilson, p. 137 When Botkina heard the conclusion of the Sokolov Report, that the Tsar, his family and their servants had been killed, her sole consolation was the fact that her father had died trying to shield the Tsar. Exile In the fall of 1918, Botkina married Konstantin Melnik, an officer of the Ukrainian Rifles whom she had known at Tsarskoye Selo.Kurth, p. 137King and Wilson, p.505 They escaped from Russia through Vladivostok and eventually settled in Rives, France, in a town near Grenoble, where they raised their children. Botkina divorced her husband some years later and settled near Paris, where she lived the rest of her life.Kurth, p. 296 Relationship with Anna Anderson Botkina was first persuaded to visit Anna Anderson in 1926, after hearing about her story from her relative, Sergei Botkin. Botkina was persuaded that the woman was truly Grand Duchess Anastasia after hearing her describe an event that Botkina said only she and the youngest grand duchess could have known anything about. Anderson appeared to remember that Botkina's father, Dr. Eugene Botkin, had personally undressed Anastasia and performed a nurse's duties for her when the grand duchess was ill with measles in the spring of 1917. \\"Only once then, it happened that my father tended the Grand Duchesses alone and performed nurses' duties for them,\\" Botkina recalled in 1929. \\"This fact has never been published anywhere, and apart from my father I alone knew anything about it.\\"Kurth, p. 143 She was a supporter of Anderson for the next sixty years and, like her brother Gleb, wrote her own memoirs about her friendship with the imperial family and her time in Russia.

Although Ak Taghliks had been expelled from Kashgaria by the Qing in the 1760s, they had not abandoned their hopes of reconquering the region, and regularly invaded it from their base in Khanate of Kokand. Wali Khan followed in the footsteps of his father, Jahangir Khoja, his uncle Yusuf, and cousin Katti Torah, who had all invaded Kashgaria with various success through the first half of the 19th century. He invaded Kashgaria in 1852 (with Divan Quli), 1855 (with Husayn Ishan Khoja), and most famously in 1857. Wali Khan, who was reputed for his brutality and tyranny, let a rebellion in 1855 and began by attacking Kashgar. Chinese were massacred and the daughters and wives of the subordinates of the loyalist Turki governor were seized. Adolphe Schlagintweit, a German, was executed by beheading by Wali Khan and his head put on display. Wali Khan was infamous for his cruelty and if courtiers \\"raised their eyes\\" to him he would murder them, when the call to prayer was made by a muezzin and his voice was too loud the muezzin was murdered by Wali Khan. A 12,000 strong Chinese army crushed and defeated the 20,000 strong army of Wali Khan in 77 days of combat. Wali Khan was abandoned by his \\"allies\\" due to his cruelty. The Chinese inflicted harsh reprisals upon Wali Khan's forces and had his son and father in law executed in harsh manners. In the West Wali Khan is mostly known for his execution of the German explorer Adolf Schlagintweit in 1857, but his cruelty found many other reflections in the local legends. It is said that he killed so many innocent Muslims that four or six minarets were built from the skulls of the victims ( kala minara ); or that once, when an artisan made a sabre for him, he instantly tested the weapon with the words, \\"Well, I'll try it now,\\" by cutting off the artisan's son head, who had come with his father and was standing nearby. Then, with the words, \\"Yes, it's a really good sabre,\\" he presented artisan with a gift. This treatment did not make Kashgarians miss the khoja too much when he was defeated by the Chinese troops after ruling the city for four months. The local Uyghurs of Altishahr grew to hate and despite Wali Khan for his forcible introduction of Kokandi culture and suppression of Kashgari culture and for his brutality. In 1865, after Kokand Khanate had been successfully invaded by the Russian and its ruler Alimqul killed, Wali Khan joined a large group of Kokandian officials who decided to try their luck in Kashgaria. They appeared in Kashgar in September 1865, but had to submit to the fellow Kokandian Yaqub Beg, who had already firmly established himself as the ruler of the city. Wali Khan's followers attempts to bring him to power again very easily foiled by Yaqub Beg, who had Wali Khan arrested and sent to Yangihissar under armed guard, where he was later poisoned.

Published in 1999, it is the first book in her Dark Series, which to date has 33 titles. Plot summary Dark Prince introduces the Carpathians, a powerful and ancient race. They have many gifts, including the ability to shape-shift, and extended life spans, living well over many years. Though they feed on human blood, they don't kill their human prey, and for the most part live among them without detection. Despite their gifts, the Carpathians are on the edge of extinction. There have been few children born to them in the past few centuries, those that have been born are all male and often die in the first year. It has been more than 500 years since a female has been born. Without females, many of the males are turning, becoming vampires, the monsters of human legend. After 200 years, a male Carpathian loses the ability to feel emotions and see in color. These will only return to him when he finds his lifemate, the other half of his soul. Mikhail Dubrinsky, Prince of the Carpathians, has worked tirelessly for centuries to discover why so many of their children die in the first years. However, his efforts have come to no avail. It is at this time, when he is on the brink of despair and self- destruction that he meets a beautiful human psychic, Raven Whitney. Raven is a strong telepath, and has worked with the police to capture four serial killers. But her gift has come with a price: a life of isolation, and pain whenever she uses her gift. When he meets her, he is shocked and amazed when he suddenly is able to see colors in her presence; he realizes that she is his lifemate. Despite his joy, there is doubt in his mind. No human woman has ever been a lifemate to a Carpathian. All human females who were converted had become deranged creatures, feeding on children and had to be destroyed. But he knows she is the only woman for him, the other half of his soul. He is determined to live as a human with her and to die when she does. However, this is not to be. Raven is attacked by fanatics, and he is forced to convert her to save her life. Her survival brings new hope to him and his people, for if one psychic human female can be a lifemate, surely there are others.

It was developed jointly by webMethods and SAP in a partnership which lasted from March 1999 to March 2002. webMethods contributed the Integration Server platform (including components like HTTP server & client, FTP server & client, SMTP/IMAP/POP3 client, XML processing tools, data mapping engine, job scheduler), while SAP contributed the components for RFC/tRFC, BAPI and IDoc communication and processing. These SAP components were bundled into an add-on package (called \\"SAP Adapter\\") that can be installed on top of the core Integration Server. History Technically the SAP Business Connector is a webMethods Integration Server bundled with a pre-installed \\"SAP Adapter\\". SAP customers were able to license additional adapters from webMethods (like \\"Baan Adapter\\", \\"JD Edwards Adapter\\", \\"Oracle Adapter\\", \\"PeopleSoft Adapter\\", \\"Siebel Adapter\\", etc.). These adapters would run on a wM Integration Server and an SAP BC alike, as during that time (meaning from release 2.1 to 4.6) the core platform of both products was identical. Then in March 2002 the partnership was discontinued and both companies started developing a successor version independently: SAP (who had acquired the full core Integration Server source code) started developing SAP BC 4.7, while webMethods began work on wM IS 6.0. Of course the component that changed most in SAP BC 4.7 was the \\"SAP Adapter\\", which got enhanced IDoc processing capabilities and performance improvements in the RFC communication layer. However, SAP also enhanced selected components of the core Integration Server, e.g. the job scheduler, the \\"Reverse Invoke\\" feature and the WmPartners package, which was completely redesigned. SAP tried to do these core enhancements in a backward compatible way, the only exception being the WmPartners package whose architecture had to be changed radically, because the original version had proved to be a serious performance bottleneck. Consequently, most webMethods adapters developed for wM IS 4.6 or wM IS 6.0 should still run on an SAP BC 4.7, with the exception of those adapters that have a tight coupling with the WmPartners package. SAP BC 4.7 was released in June 2003. By that time SAP had already started development of its own integration/middleware product (\\"Message Broker\\", later renamed to \\"Exchange Infrastructure\\" (SAP XI), nowadays called \\"Process Integration\\" (SAP PI)), so the SAP Business Connector product line was frozen at version 4.7 between 2003 and 2007. Then, in summer 2007, it became more and more apparent, that the maintainability of SAP BC 4.7 was endangered, because most operating systems and Java VM versions, on which the BC depended, had gone out of maintenance. Therefore, development for another release (SAP BC 4.8) was started. This version was released in July 2008 and can be seen as a maintenance update to support newer JVM's and operating systems. See SAP note 1094412. However, as was the case with SAP BC 4.7, SAP again added a number of enhancements and performance improvements to some \\"wM core components\\" as well as to the \\"SAP components\\", most notably to the worker thread pool, the database adapter, the debugging, monitoring and tracing capabilities, the RFC and IDoc processing and the \\"Developer\\" tool. In response to the split webMethods has created the webMethods for SAP as an updated (version 6.0.1 onward) product for SAP customers wishing to continue using webMethods technology for middleware/B2B integration. Use cases and functionality The role of the SAP Business Connector is to provide XML/web services type integration between SAP instances or from SAP to 3rd party systems/B2B (as the R/3 platform had no similar capabilities). Typical usecases include: * Exchanging data between your application and your business partner's R/3 system via the internet (using HTTP(S), FTP or Email) * Accessing data sources in the internet from within your SAP system (e.g. extracting data from online catalogs) * Exchanging data with third party non-SAP systems inside or outside your corporate firewall (e.g. vendor or supplier systems, inhouse legacy systems) Differences between SAP Business Connector and webMethods Integration Server * Web administration user interface was branded with the SAP water drop logo and different colour scheme for UI * SAP BC comes with the \\"SAP Adapter\\", while on the wM IS it has to be installed separately * The SAP Adapter inside the Business Connector is a shared development between SAP and webMethods. It was further enhanced in UI functionality (mainly for usability issues) by SAP after the end of the partnership. * The official SAP Adapter inside the webMethods Integration Server was redeveloped for version 6.5 and uses different internal services to access SAP. * The SAP BC is mainly a webMethods Integration Server 4.6 with minor changes up to SAP BC 4.8. (Releases 4.6; 4.7; 4.8) * The webMethods Integration Server went from Release 4.6 straight to Release 6.0 and continued to evolve up to release 10 (Releases 6.0; 6.1, 6.5; 7.01; 7.1; 7.2; 8.0; 8.2;9.0;9.5;9.6;9.7;9.12;10) See also * webMethods Integration Server References External links * Note 1094412 - Release and Support Strategy of SAP Business Connector 4.8 Business Connector ","title":"SAP Business Connector"},{"id":"9726811","text":"John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox (c. 14904 September 1526, Linlithgow, West Lothian) was a prominent Scottish magnate.

Hall III (born 1958) is a former United States Army warrant officer and signals intelligence analyst in Germany who sold eavesdropping and code secrets to East Germany and the Soviet Union from 1983 to 1988.https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/us/trial-is-ordered-in-espionage- case.htmlhttps://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-05/news/mn-311_1_army-charges Hall was convicted of espionage on July 20, 1989; he was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment, fined $50,000, ordered to forfeit all proceeds from his activities, and given a dishonorable discharge. He served his sentence at the United States Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from which he was released in September 2011 after 22 years. Activities Hall was assigned to the NSA Field Station Berlin Teufelsberg, one of the premier listening posts of the Cold War, between 1982-85 and he spied for both East Germany and the Soviet Union. Between 1983-88, he betrayed hundreds of military secrets, which includes Project Trojan, a worldwide electronic network with the ability to pinpoint armored vehicles, missiles and aircraft by recording their signal emissions during wartime Koehler, O. John. STASI: The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police. Boulder, Col.:Westview Press, 1999, page 227 and the complete National SIGINT Requirements List (NSRL), a 4258-page document about NSA activities, government requirements and SIGINT capabilities by country. Hall sometimes spent up to two hours of his workday reproducing classified documents to provide to the Soviets and East Germans. Concerned that he was not putting in his regular duty time, he consistently worked late to complete his regular assignments. He used shopping bags to smuggle out originals of the documents, which he then photocopied in a Frankfurt flat with the help of an East Berlin associate. Using his illegal income, Hall paid cash for a brand new Volvo and a new truck, made a large down payment on a home, and took flying lessons. He is said to have given his military colleagues at least six conflicting stories to explain his lavish lifestyle. In 1986, Hall was stationed at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and was returning to Germany. Passed over for promotion to Sergeant First Class that year, Hall was also applying for an appointment as a warrant officer. As a part of the routine background investigation associated with the warrant appointment, one of his supervisors, a Major (Hall was, at the time, a staff sergeant) commented to the investigator that he found it strange that Hall could drive the Volvo, a car that the Major couldn't afford. The Major went on to explain that he had, himself, asked Hall about this apparent disparity; Hall responded that he had a wealthy aunt who died and left him a large trust from which he received $30,000 annually. The Major found the story plausible, but reiterated it to the investigators during their visit with him. The investigators thanked the Major for the information and told him they already knew about the \\"trust\\". Hall's co-workers were fully taken in by his duplicity and his unusual activities never drew much attention. After returning from Germany to the US, he traveled to Vienna, Austria, to meet with his Soviet handler. His co-workers wondered why he would re-enlist, and become a warrant officer, after several times conveying to them his dissatisfaction with army life. Of course, the Warrant Officer rank had allowed him greater access to classified material. During his 1977‚Äì81 tour at Detachment Schneeberg, an intelligence gathering outpost for the VII Corps' 326th ASA (Army Security Agency) Company on what was the West German-Czechoslovakian border during the Cold War, Hall had a generally good working relationship with his peers, but was considered by peers to be only an average analyst. He would sometimes erupt and become upset over trivial day-to-day problems. However, for the most part he was considered to be a sociable colleague, and he also quickly picked up a working knowledge of the German language. Hall also met his future wife, who worked at a local restaurant in Bischofsgruen, a popular tourist town where the majority of the Detachment soldiers lived. Hall was eventually arrested on December 21, 1988, in Savannah, Georgia, after telling an undercover FBI agent that over a period of six years, he had sold Top Secret intelligence data to East Germany and the Soviet Union. At the time, Hall believed that he was speaking to a Soviet contact, and during this conversation claimed that he had been motivated only by money. He told the FBI agent posing as a Soviet intelligence officer, \\"I wasn't terribly short of money. I just decided I didn't ever want to worry where my next dollar was coming from. I'm not anti-American. I wave the flag as much as anybody else.\\" The case against Hall apparently began based on a tip from Manfred Severin (code-named Canna Clay), a Stasi instructor who acted as a translator and courier for James Hall. Rejected by the German Staatschutz and the CIA, Army Foreign Counterintelligence (FCA) eventually sponsored him because he had a big tip about James Hall. After Hall was apprehended, Severin was exfiltrated to the West with his family.Kristie Macrakis, Seduced by Secrets: Inside the Stasi's Spy-Tech World. New York: CUP, 2008, pps. 107-108 After his arrest, Hall said there were many indicators visible to those around him that he was involved in questionable activity. Hall's activities inflicted grave damage on U.S. signals intelligence and he is considered the perpetrator of \\"one of the most costly and damaging breaches of security of the long Cold War\\".Herrington, Stuart A. Traitors among Us: Inside the Spy Catcher's World.

Hall had received $300,000 in payments from the Stasi and the KGB. After the reunification of Germany, on July 24, 1992, almost all of the documents Hall had copied and handed over to the Stasi (13,088 pages in total) were given back to the NSA by the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records, Joachim Gauck (later President of Germany). This was ordered by the Federal Ministry of the Interior after US government pressure without consulting or informing the German Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee (:de:Parlamentarisches Kontrollgremium), which was a prerequisite for giving files away required by law (:de:Stasi-Unterlagen- Gesetz). Only a few hundred pages were retained and kept Top Secret.

It rises in northwest Chelan County and flows southwest into the White River near Twin Lakes. The White River flows into Lake Wenatchee. The Napeequa River and its valley are notable for their beauty and isolation, as well as their interesting geological history. It flows through an isolated southeast-trending valley characterized by a broad meadows surrounded by rugged mountains. The Chiwawa Mountains, or Chiwawa Ridge mark the east side of the valley, separating the Napeequa and Chiwawa Rivers. To the west the White Mountains separate the Napeequa from the White River. Both are sub-ranges of the Cascade Range. The river is part of the Columbia River basin, being a tributary of the Chiwawa River, which joins the Wenatchee River, a tributary of the Columbia River. A large number of place names in the Napeequa River basin, including the river's name itself, were given by Albert H. Sylvester. Course The Napeequa River flows from Butterfly Glacier in the Glacier Peak Wilderness. It flows west briefly then enters its main southeast-trending valley. Near the head of the valley the Napeequa is joined by a south-flowing tributary originating near High Pass. Flowing southeast through its valley the Napeequa is joined by Louis Creek from the north, then an unnamed stream flowing east from Pliz Glacier and Richardson Glacier. Numerous small streams tumble down the Napeequa valley's high slopes. The valley widens and flattens considerably and the river meanders lazily. Hiking trails enter the valley via Boulder Pass and Little Giant Pass (both over high-the valley floor is about high in this vicinity), crossing the White Mountains and Chiwawa Ridge respectively. Many backpackers bushwhack from or to High Pass/Triad Lake just north of the headwaters of the Napeequa. There are no trails into the valley that do not cross a high pass. Downstream the valley narrows for some distance, then widens again. Many tributaries flow down the steep slopes on both sides of the glacial valley. In its last mile the Napeequa turns west to join the White River. It is joined by Lake Creek from the south, which drains Twin Lakes. The Napeequa Valley continues southeast from Twin Lakes but it occupied by Big Meadow Creek, a tributary of the Chiwawa River. Big Meadow Creek was probably once a tributary of the Napeequa but was captured by the Chiwawa. The Napeequa Valley has been compared to the fabled Shangri-La. The valley is part of the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Geologic history Fred Beckey calls the Napeequa River valley the \\"most interesting valley\\" of the region. It is a classical glacier-carved U-shaped trough, flat bottomed and nearly straight. Its present form was created by a Pleistocene era glacier. The lower valley is so broad and flat the Napeequa River meanders slowly through it. Near Twin Lakes the Napeequa makes an abrupt westward turn, leaving its valley through a steep gorge cut through the gneiss rock of the high ridge between the Napeequa and White River valleys. Big Meadow Creek occupies the southern part of the same glacial- carved valley, flowing southeast to the Chiwawa River. It is probable that the Napeequa River used to flow through the entire valley including the southern end now occupied by Big Meadow Creek. It is also likely that as the ice retreated a large lake formed in the valley. History The river was once called the North Fork of the White River. Forest Service supervisor A.H. Sylvester changed the name to Napeequa, a Salishan word meaning white water, because the river's water is nearly white in the spring and summer due to heavy glacial silt.Napeequa River , Tacoma Public Library - Washington Place Names According to William Bright the name comes \\"perhaps a Sinkiuse-Columbia word meaning white water place.\\" See also * List of rivers of Washington * List of tributaries of the Columbia River References Rivers of Washington (state) Tributaries of the Columbia River Rivers of Chelan County, Washington ","title":"Napeequa River"},{"id":"9726857","text":"Marian Anderson, the great American opera contralto, prepares to christen the Booker T.

At launch Mary McLeod Bethune gave the address and notable singer Marian Anderson christened the ship. Hugh Mulzac, the first African-American earn a United States Merchant Marine master's license and only African American to have such license was selected to command a ship after acceptance trials. In 1942, the ship has an integrated crew of 18 nationalities. Between 1942 and 1947, it had made 22 round trip voyages ferrying troops and supplies to Europe and the Pacific theatre. Construction Booker T. Washington, MC hull number 648, was laid down on 19 August 1942 and launched on 29 September by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles. The ship was the first large oceangoing ship named after an African American and first of seventeen Liberty ships to be so named. Mary McLeod Bethune gave the address at the launching ceremony and Marian Anderson christened the ship. As part of the Maritime Commission plan the ship was to be delivered after sea trials and acceptance to the command of the only African American in the nation to hold a master's certificate, Captain Hugh Mulzac. The ship was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for operation on 17 October 1942 with Luckenbach Steamship Company as the WSA agent. Captain Mulzac remained in command for the next four years commanding an integrated crew composed of seventeen nationalities. Booker T. Washington, official number 342392, was a standard Liberty of the cargo configuration, designated type EC2-S-C1. Specifications were for a five hold ship of The Maritime Commission standard GRT. The MARAD status card at time of disposal shows which could reflect either modifications or different calculation method., . The standard Liberty cargo type dimensions of length overall, length between perpendiculars, waterline length, beam, with a draft of applied. Though the nominal speed of the Liberty type was the Maritime Administration vessel status card has 11 stricken with an annotation of . Cargo capacity, given in two measures of dry cargo volume as, was bale and grain. Crew The captain, second officer, third officer, and the Chief Engineer were African American. Other officers were white. The crew was composed of African Americans, whites, and other races. On completion of the ship's maiden voyage morale was high, each man gave a pint of blood and purchase of war bonds was high. The crew and officers donated to buy a gold watch for Captain Mulzac. Captain Mulzac apparently thought those initiating the experiment of an integrated crew under an African American captain and other officers expected it would fail. Instead it was successful over twelve voyages in the North Atlantic, Caribbean and to North Africa. Operations From delivery to WSA on 17 October 1942 the ship was operated by Luckenbach Steamship Company for WSA supporting wartime logistics. In early 1943 Booker T. Washington made its first trans-Atlantic crossing. On 23 March 1947 the arrangement was converted from the wartime operation agreement to a bareboat charter to Luckenbach until 19 November when the ship was put under agreement with A. L. Burbank & Company, Ltd., possibly in preparation for layup in the Hudson River Reserve Fleet on 22 December 1947. On 19 July 1951 the ship was again operated under a then Maritime Administration agreement until entering the Olympia Reserve Fleet 26 September 1952. From then until sold in 1969 the ship was part of the Grain Program in which surplus grain was stored in National Defense Reserve Fleet ships with ships being activated only to load or unload grain. Disposal The ship was sold for $40,404.04 on 21 May 1969 to Zidell Explorations, Inc. and removed from the Reserve Fleet, Olympia, Washington on 24 June 1969 for scrapping.

It is north of Edgewater, east of Little Haiti, south of the village of Miami Shores, and sits on Biscayne Bay. In geographical order from south to north and east to west, it contains the subdivisions of Magnolia Park, Bay Point, Morningside, Bayside, Belle Meade, Shorecrest, and Palm Grove. The MiMo District along Biscayne Boulevard in the area is host to many art galleries, shops and restaurants. The Upper East Side is primarily a residential neighborhood, composed largely of historic single-family homes from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, with Biscayne Boulevard running along the center of the neighborhood with mid-rise and high-rise office towers, hotels, and apartments. The MiMo Historic District runs along Biscayne Boulevard, and includes a large number of MiMo hotels from the 1950s and 1960s, that have been preserved, and have recently begun to be renovated, and turned into stores, restaurants and boutique hotels. Geography Magnolia Park lies east of Biscayne Boulevard between NE 37th Street (next to the Julia Tuttle Causeway) and NE 39th Street. Bay Point is east of the Boulevard, north of NE 39th Street and south of NE 50th Terrace. Morningside lies east of the Boulevard from NE 50th Terrace to NE 60th Street. Bayside is east of the Boulevard from NE 61st Street to NE 72nd Street. Belle Meade is east of the Boulevard from NE 72nd Terrace to NE 77th Terrace. Shorecrest is east of the Boulevard from NE 78th Street to NE 87th Street. Palm Grove is west of Biscayne Boulevard between NE 54th Street and NE 77th Street Road (i.e.: south of the Little River). The area between NE 37th Street and NE 54th Street from Biscayne Boulevard westward one block to Federal Highway is not officially part of any of these neighborhoods but is nevertheless part of the UES. Similarly, the area from the Little River north to the city limits and between Biscayne Boulevard on the east and the Little River and the Village of El Portal on the west is not part of any of the aforementioned neighborhoods but is part of the UES. Neighborhoods =Shorecrest= Shorecrest is the northernmost sub-neighborhood of the Upper East Side bounded by the Little River on the south (approximately NE 79th Street), Biscayne Boulevard on the west, Miami's northern city limits and the Village of Miami Shores to the north, and Biscayne Bay to the east. As of 2000, the population of Shorecrest was 3,989 people. Shorecrest is an ethnically diverse neighborhood . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 35.80% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 31.94% White (non-Hispanic), and 29.13% Black or African American. Shorecrest contains many historic single-family homes dating to the 1930s and 1940s, as well as some multi-family apartments and condominiums along its southern and western boundaries. The main commercial corridors in the neighborhood are 79th Street and Biscayne Boulevard. The area has experienced increased development and revitalization in recent years with the addition of new restaurants and stores. The sub-neighborhood of Daivs Harbor, located east of NE 10th Avenue contains various waterfront homes with access to Biscayne Bay. =Palm Grove= Palm Grove is a historic neighborhood which lies within the Upper East Side, bounded by Biscayne Boulevard to the east, NE 54th Street to the south, the Little River on the north, and the Florida East Coast Railway tracks on the west. The neighborhood contains many historic homes from the 1920s and 1930s, many of which have recently been renovated and restored. Palm Grove is a diverse community consisting of artists, young professionals, and Haitian immigrants. As of 2000, the population of Palm Grove was 3,349. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 22.77% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 56.79% Black or African American, and 10.69% White (non-Hispanic). The Palm Grove Neighborhood contains a significant collection of residential architecture from the early to mid-20th century. The most dominant styles in the district are Spanish Eclectic and Mission, reflecting the strong influence of the Spanish Colonial and Revival styles in Florida during this period. The district also contains notable examples of the Art Deco, Art Moderne, Craftsman, and Colonial Revival styles of the early 20th century. By mid- century, other building styles such as Minimal Traditional and Ranch were constructed. Several dwellings were also built in a local style known as \\"Miami Modern\\" or \\"Mimo.\\" Miami Ironside Ironside is an urban art and design district located in Miami's Upper Eastside, off of the MiMo Historic Biscayne Boulevard and along the northwest boundary of Palm Grove. The stretch of industrial warehouses was acquired in 2003 by local developer Ofer Mizrahi, and envisioned as an interconnected network of mixed-purpose architectural complexes. It is home to over 65 designer showrooms, art galleries, architecture firms, creative services, eateries, residences, multi-purpose spaces, and a public piazza with permanent Berlin Wall sculptures painted by street artist Thierry Noir. Twice a year, Ironside hosts a Campus Collective, a community event. =Belle Meade= Belle Meade is a sub-neighborhood which lies within the larger enclave of the Upper East Side. It is a private, gated community and the southern part contains a smaller subdivision known as the Bayside Historic District. The northern part contains Belle Meade Island. It is bounded by the Little River to the north, northeast 72nd Terrace to the south, Biscayne Boulevard to the west, and Biscayne Bay to the east. Demographics of Belle Meade As of 2000, the population of Belle Meade had 2,149 people. The zip code for Belle Meade is 33138. The area covers . As of 2000, there were 1,248 males and 900 females.

As of 2000, the racial makeup of Belle Meade (including the Bayside Historic District) was 42.68% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 1.60% Black or African American, and 52.66% White (non-Hispanic). =Morningside= Morningside Park Morningside is a residential historic sub-neighborhood within the Upper Eastside in an older part of the City of Miami, Florida, United States. It lies mostly to the east of Biscayne Boulevard from NE 50th Terrace to NE 62nd Street.Morningside (Bayshore) neighborhood, detailed profile Morningside is just north of and adjacent to Bay Point Estates, another more affluent but less historic residential enclave in urban Miami. When Pope John Paul II visited the United States, he stayed at what was then the home of Archbishop Edward McCarthy on NE 53rd Street. History of Morningside Started in the 1920s as \\"Bay Shore,\\" it prospered in the mid-20th century and fell on hard times along with most of Miami's other inner city neighborhoods in the 60's and 70's. More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District. . The Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree- lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the city's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb. The Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship. The majority of neighborhood residents recognize the special character of the area and desire its continued preservation. As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924. Architecture of Morningside Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the city's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity. Demographics of Morningside As of 2000, the population of Morningside was 1,074 people. The racial makeup of Morningside was 14.90% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 28.49% Black or African American, and 55.21% White (non-Hispanic). =Bay Point= Bay Point is a sub- neighborhood within the Upper East Side neighborhood, in the City of Miami, Florida, United States. It is a gated community stretching from NE 41st Street to NE 50th Street alongside Biscayne Boulevard. The neighborhood streets are privately owned by the households and access to the roads and waterways are restricted to the residents (and their guests), of which there are approximately 250. To maintain the streets and the neighborhood's 24-hour security, all residents must pay neighborhood dues that can total approximately $2,200 per year. Prices for homes in the Miami enclave range from approximately $1,100,000 for a home that needs to renovated on a dry lot, to just south of $27,000,000 for a larger home with widebay views. One reason for the neighborhood's desirability is its location and high security. Centralized in the City of Miami, it is essentially a suburban contiguity located in the heart of the Miami area's urban core. It is less than ten minutes from downtown Miami and South Beach, and within twenty minutes away from most other major centers in Miami, such as Coral Gables, Hialeah, and Aventura, Florida. Much of the neighborhood's high real estate values are thanks not to the homes, but the property the house sits on. It is adjacent to Morningside, another affluent, historic residential neighborhood in Miami's urban core. The residents' homes are lined along Sabal Palm Road, one of the most expensive streets to live on in the United States. The style of the homes varies. Most of the homes were built between 1940 and 1960 and many homes are currently undergoing major renovations as, and exhibit architectural styles ranging from contemporary Floridian to ranch. Many of the neighborhood's wealthy residents are among the most prominent lawyers, doctors, and businessmen in Miami. Its most famous current and former residents include Enrique Iglesias, Dwyane Wade, Goran Dragic, Stephen Zack, Liv√°n Hern√°ndez, Willy Chirino, and DMX. As of 2000, the population of Bay Point was 1,378 people. The racial makeup of Baypoint was 49.20% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 5.2% Black or African American, and 36.7% White (non-Hispanic). =Bayside Historic District= The Bayside Historic District is a sub- neighborhood of the Upper East Side. The area is generally bounded by NE 72nd Street and N.E. 72nd Terrace on the north; Biscayne Bay on the east; NE 67th Street on the south; and Biscayne Boulevard to the west. History of Bayside The Bayside Historic District reflects the formative years of the early 1900s through the mid-1940s. Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami. Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were platted between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925. In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community. While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s. The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street. The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire. The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity. Architecture of Bayside Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity. Demographics The Upper East Side has a population of 15,056 of different ethnicities and races that includes high, middle and low income residents. Biscayne Boulevard is the central spine of this neighborhood.Neighborhood Enhancement Team Profile The neighborhood like the rest of Miami is quickly becoming composed mostly of artistic and bright colored homes and condos. The area has some of the highest crime rates in Miami for an area that has a substantial amount of middle- and high-income residents. As of 2010, The Upper Eastside had a population of 15,056 residents, with 6,263 households, and 3,167 families residing in the neighborhood. The median household income was $35,196.16. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 37.26% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 29.65% Black or African American, 28.68% White (non- Hispanic), and 4.41% Other races (non-Hispanic). MiMo Historic District MiMo District sign Today, the area along Biscayne Boulevard is the designated MiMo Architecture Biscayne Boulevard Historic District or also known as \\"MiMo on BiBo\\", for \\"Miami Modern on Biscayne Boulevard\\". MiMo Historic District runs roughly from 50th Street to 77th Street along Biscayne Boulevard, although MiMo can be found heavily in the Miami Design District and Midtown. Many annual festivals are held to promote MiMo architecture, such as \\"Cinco de MiMo\\" a play on \\"Cinco de Mayo\\" in early May. Biscayne Boulevard throughout the Upper East Side fell to urban decay after the 1980s, and experienced increased crime, prostitution and drug dealings. In the 2000s, preservation efforts began to bring development interest into the neighborhood, and Biscayne Boulevard began to improve. Today, the boulevard is in a fast upwards transition along with many other nearby neighborhoods such as the Design District, Wynwood and Edgewater, with strong preservation efforts to preserve the MiMo architecture. Zoning and public projects Under pressure from residents to keep undesirably large buildings out, The Miami City Commission considered new building codes and a 180-day moratorium on February 26 of 2007. With many homes built in the late 1920s, the Upper Eastside encompasses some of Miami's oldest neighborhoods and residents desire to keep it that way. The proposed codes were looser on distance to low-density areas but stricter on building height. A beautification and landscape project was recently completed on Biscayne Boulevard and Legion Park and Eaton Park recently received improvements such as new playground equipment. Construction on new Little River Canal and efforts to fight crime are currently being worked on.

Hickel is a visual effects animator for Industrial Light & Magic. At the age of 12, Hickel wrote a letter to Lucasfilm, outlining his ideas for a sequel to the original Star Wars movie (now known as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), and received a polite rejection letter from producer Gary Kurtz. The letter now hangs on the wall of Hickel's office at ILM. Twenty years later, Hickel found himself working on Star Wars after all, as a lead animator on Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. A native of Bailey, Colorado, Hickel joined the Film Graphics Program at CalArts in 1982. He worked at An-FX from 1982 until 1988, and then joined Will Vinton Studios, working in stop-motion and motion control. Hickel began his animation career at Pixar in 1994, where he worked on Toy Story and the THX promos, as well as some of Pixar's short films. Hearing that a new Star Wars trilogy was in pre-production, Hickel applied for a transfer to ILM on the chance that he might get to work on the prequels. He was first assigned as an animator on The Lost World: Jurassic Park, but was eventually assigned to work on The Phantom Menace, and later its sequel, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, where he was responsible for the unique movement of the Droideka destroyer droids.

In 1721, he was named master of the cathedral of Toledo, for whom he constructed the famous Altarwork, the Transparente (1721‚Äì1732), and example of the elaborate Spanish Baroque. El Transparente, derives its name from the play of light on the altar, and is several stories high, with fantastic figures of stucco, painting, bronze castings, and multiple colors of marble, a masterpiece of Baroque mixed media by Narciso Tom√© enhanced by the daily effect for a few minutes of a shaft of sunlight striking it through an appropriately oriented hole in the roof, giving the impression that the whole altar is rising to heaven.

The township of Queenscliff lies at its southern end, and St Leonards at its northern. It is partly separated from Port Phillip by Swan Island, Duck Island and Edwards Point. Most of the area is included in the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park as well as being listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention as part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site.Parks Victoria. (2006). Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park Management Plan. Parks Victoria: Melbourne. The bay is part of the Swan Bay and Port Phillip Bay Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for orange-bellied parrots, waders and seabirds. Matthew Flinders named the bay \\"Swan Ponds\\" after its black swans, up to 2,700 of which can be seen in summer and early autumn. Ecology Swan Bay contains a variety of ecosystems that make it environmentally important for waterbirds and migratory waders. These include salt marsh, intertidal mudflats and vast seagrass beds on which, almost everything living in the bay relies on for food. Although much of the surrounding land is farmland, some remnant woodland survives in the adjoining Edwards Point Nature Reserve and Swan Bay itself. The bay has been recognised as having international importance and the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park almost entirely occupies the bay. Nearly 200 species of birds have been recorded in Swan bay. Birds of conservation significance for which the bay and its shore are internationally important include the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot as well as little tern, fairy tern, eastern curlew, Lewin's rail and white-bellied sea eagle. It also supports over 1% of the Australian population of four wader species: Grey plover, Pacific golden plover, double-banded plover and eastern curlew.Barter, Mark; Campbell, Jeff; & Lane, Brett. (1988). Swan Bay: Conservation of Birds. RAOU Report No.50. Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union: Melbourne. Other birds found in the region include the Australian pelican, silver gull, royal spoonbill, Caspian and crested terns, white-fronted chat, sacred ibis, red-necked stint, little pied cormorant and pied oystercatcher. Some of these birds travel from as far away as Arctic Siberia and Alaska where they breed, to feed on the intertidal mudflats of Swan Bay. Geography Swan Bay lies at the eastern end of the Bellarine Peninsula in Port Phillip. It is partly separated from Port Phillip by Swan Island, Duck Island and Edwards Point. Islands located within the bay include Mangrove Island, Rabbit Island, Sand Island, Stingaree Island and Tip Island. Recreation Recreation in the bay mainly revolves around sightseeing activities such as sea kayaking, scuba diving, bird watching and various wildlife tours. Boating is limited in Swan Bay, particularly around Swan Island and in Stingaree Bight, there is a 5 knot speed limit and many areas of the bay become very shallow at low tide. Myths There is supposedly a treasure hidden in a cave on the southern shoreline of Swan Bay. The myth revolves around the pirate Benito \\"Bloody Sword\\" Bonito, who raided the west coast of the Americas. His career began around 1818 but from there on sources differ. According to one legend his ship was boarded by a British man- of-war after Bonito exited Port Phillip after hiding a treasure in Swan Bay, apparently the so-called \\"Lost Loot of Lima\\", sometime in 1821. He was subsequently given a trial and hanged.

However, this is viewed with suspicion by some, \\"who see it as an opportunistic move against the main opposition party, the secular CHP.\\"  Background  =Ottoman period= Kurdish and Zaza tribes, which were feudal (manorial) communities led by chieftains (agha) during the Ottoman period, enjoyed a certain degree of freedom within the boundaries of the manors owned by the aghas. Local authority in these small manorial communities was in the hands of feudal lords, tribal chieftains and other dignitaries, who owned the land and ruled over the peasants who lived and worked in their real estate.Faik Bulut, Devletin G√∂z√ºyle T√ºrkiye'de K√ºrt ƒ∞syanlar (Kurdish rebellions in Turkey, from the government point of view), Y√∂n Yayƒ±nclƒ±k, 1991, 214-215. However, the general political authority in the provinces, such as Dersim, was in the hands of the Ottoman government. =Early republican era= Following the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, some Kurdish and Zaza tribes became unhappy about certain aspects of Atat√ºrk's Reforms for modernising Turkey, such as secularism and land reform, and staged armed revolts that were put down by the Turkish military. Dersim had been a particularly difficult province for the Ottoman government to control, with 11 different armed rebellions between 1876 and 1923.NTV Tarih, Issue: 11, \\"Dersim 1937-1938\\" The rebellious stance of the aghas in Dersim continued during the early years of the Republic of Turkey. Aghas in Dersim objected to losing authority in their manorial affairs and refused to pay taxes; and complaints from the provincial governors in Dersim were sent to the central government in Ankara, which favoured land reform and direct control over the country's farmlands, as well as state planning for agricultural production. In an Interior Ministry report in 1926, it was considered necessary to use force against the aghas of Dersim.Be≈üik√ßi, Ismail.

Its measures included the forced relocation of people within Turkey, with the aim of promoting cultural homogeneity. In 1935, the Tunceli Law was passed to apply the Resettlement Law to the newly-named region of Tunceli, previously known as Dersim and populated by Kurdish and Zaza Alevis. This area had a reputation for being rebellious, having been the scene of eleven separate periods of armed conflict over the previous 40 years. \\"Tunceli\\" law The Dersim region included the Tunceli Province whose name was changed from Dersim to Tunceli with the \\"Law on Administration of the Tunceli Province\\" (Tunceli Vilayetinin ƒ∞daresi Hakkƒ±nda Kanun), no. 2884 of 25 December 1935New perspectives on Turkey, Issues 1-4, Simon's Rock of Bard College, 1999 p. 15. on January 4, 1936.Paul J.

The Fourth Inspectorate-General was governed by a \\"Governor Commander\\" within a military authority. He was given wide-ranging authorities in juridical, military and civilian matters. He also had the authority to resettle people or exile people who lived in the city when necessary. On 1 November 1936, during a speech in the parliament Atat√ºrk acknowledged the situation in Dersim as Turkey's most important internal problem.Hasretyan, M. A.

The Rebellion  A 1937 map of Dersim showing the central province, Hezat After the \\"Tunceli\\" Law, the Turkish government built military observation posts in the centers of districts such as Kahmut, Sin, Karaoƒülan, Amutka, Danzik, and Haydaran. Following public meetings in January 1937, a letter of protest against the law was written to be sent to the local governor. According to Kurdish sources, the emissaries of the letter were arrested and executed. In May, a group of local people ambushed a police convoy in response, the first act of a localised conflict. =Meeting at Halbori cells= Seyid Riza, the chieftain of Yukarƒ± Abbas U≈üaƒüƒ±, sent his followers to the Haydaran, Demenan, Yusufan, and Kurey≈üan tribes to make an alliance.Faik Bulut, ibid, p. 221. According to Turkish authorities, on March 20‚Äì21, 1937, at 23:00 hrs, the Demenan and Haydaran tribes broke a bridge connecting Pah and Kahmut in the Har√ßik Valley. The Inspector General gave the order to prepare for action to the 2nd Mobile Gendarmerie Battalion at P√ºl√ºm√ºr, the 3rd Mobile Gendarmerie Battalion at P√ºl√ºr, the 9th Gendarmier Battalion at Mazkirt, and the Mobile Gendarmerie Regiment at Hozat, and sent one infantry company of the 9th Mobile Gendarmier Battalion to Pah.

This task was substantially completed by the summer and the leaders of the rebellion, including tribal leader Sayiid Riza, were hanged. However, remnants of the rebel forces continued to resist and the number of troops in the region was doubled. The area was also bombed from the air. The rebels continued to resist until the region was pacified in October 1938. According to Osman Pamukoƒülu, a general in Turkish Army in the 1990s, Atat√ºrk had given the operational order himself.\\"Pamukoƒülu: Dersim'in emrini Atat√ºrk verdi\\", H√ºrriyet, August 19, 2010. =1937= First Tunceli Operation On September 10‚Äì12, 1937, Seyit Rƒ±za came to the government building of the Erzincan Province for peace talks and was arrested.Ahmet Kahraman, pp. 286-287.

Around 3,000 people were forcibly deported from Dersim. =Ethnocide= The policy of population resettlement under the 1934 Law on Resettlement was a key component of the turkification process that began to be implemented first with the Armenian genocide in 1915 as Turkey transitioned from a pluralistic, multi-ethnic society to a \\"unidimensional Turkish nation-state\\". Scholar ƒ∞smail Be≈üik√ßi has argued that the Turkish government actions in Dersim were genocide.ƒ∞smail Besik√ßi, Tunceli Kanunu (1935) ve Dersim Jenosidi, Belge Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1990. Martin van Bruinessen has argued that the actions of the government were not genocide, under international law, because they were not aimed at the extermination of a people, but at resettlement and suppression.Martin van Bruinessen: Genocide in Kurdistan? 1994, S. 141‚Äì170. Van Bruinessen has instead talked of an ethnocide directed against the local language and identity.The Suppression of the Dersim Rebellion in Turkey (1937-38) Excerpts from: Martin van Bruinessen, \\"Genocide in Kurdistan? The suppression of the Dersim rebellion in Turkey (1937-38) and the chemical war against the Iraqi Kurds (1988)\\", in: George J. Andreopoulos (ed), Conceptual and historical dimensions of genocide. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994, pp. 141-170. According to Van Bruinessen, the 1934 law created \\"the legal framework for a policy of ethnocide.\\" Dersim was one of the first territories where this policy was applied.George J Andreopoulos, Genocide, page 11. In March 2011, a Turkish court ruled that the actions of the Turkish government in Dersim could not be considered genocide according to the law because they were not directed systematically against an ethnic group.  Aftermath  = Maoist insurgency = In early 1970s Dersim Region was chosen by revolutionary leader ƒ∞brahim Kaypakkaya as a revolutionary base area for protracted people's war in Turkey. Some Dersim inhabitants saw the current Maoist guerrilla as revenge for the Dersim Massacre in 1938.Construction of a Nation: The Early Years of the Turkish Republic and Dersim Events = Recent developments = On November 23, 2011, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan apologized \\"on behalf of the state\\" over the killing of over 13,000 people during the rebellion.

Erdogan reminded his audience that Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu's party, the CHP, had been in power at the time of the massacre, then the only political party in Turkey. He described the massacre as \\"one of the most tragic events of our near history\\" saying that, whilst some sought to justify it as a legitimate response to events on the ground, it was in reality \\"an operation which was planned step by step\\".

The new institute, approved by Paul V in 1607, was the first religious order of women- teachers approved by the Church. Her feast day is May 15. Biography =Early years= De Lestonnac was born in Bordeaux in 1556 to Richard de Lestonnac, a member of the Parlement of Bordeaux, and Jeanne Eyquem, the sister of the noted philosopher, Michel Eyquem de Montaigne. She grew up in a time where the conflict between the Protestant reformists and the defenders of the Catholic faith was at its height. This was evident in her own family. While her mother became an enthusiastic Calvinist and tried to persuade her to convert, her father and her uncle Montaigne adhered to the Catholic faith and were her support in remaining a Catholic. At the age of 17 De Lestonnac married Gaston de Montferrant, with whom she had seven children, three of whom died in infancy. She was married for 24 years when her husband died. This marked the beginning of a very painful period in her life, with the further loss, within seven months, of her father, uncle and eldest son. =Religious life= Following her husband's death, St. Jeanne De Lestonnac, at the age of 46, and with her children now grown, turned to a contemplative life and entered the Cistercian Monastery in Toulouse where she was given the religious name of Jeanne of Saint Bernard. She found great peace and satisfaction in the monastic life, but, after six months, she became very ill and had to leave the monastery. She then went to live on her estate La Mothe Lusi√© to recover her health, and where she adopted the lifestyle of a secular d√©vote, performing many acts of charity, including food and alms distribution, and regularly met with young women of her social class to pray and discuss religious questions. She sought for models of Catholic women to be her guides and cultivated an interest in the lives of Saints Scholastica, Clare of Assisi, Catherine of Siena and Teresa of Avila.\\"Saint Jeanne de Lestonnac\\", International Catholic Stewardship Council A few years later, in 1605, a plague broke out in Bordeaux. At risk to her own life, De Lestonnac returned to her native city to help care for the sick and suffering in the slums of the city. =Foundress= Lestonnac's brother, a Jesuit attached to the college in Bordeaux, arranged a meeting between Lestonnac and two Jesuit fathers: Jean de Bordes and Fran√ßois de Raymond. The Jesuits asked de Lestonnac to serve as founder of a new teaching order for young women. They encouraged her to establish for girls in terms of formal education what they were doing for boys. The three decided upon a cloistered community to follow the Benedictine rule, modified to allow sisters to teach. The group gained the approval of Pope Paul V in 1607. The community took the name of the Compagnie de Notre-Dame.Wright, Anthony D., The Divisions of French Catholicism, 1629‚Äì1645, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013 The group purchased an old priory near the Ch√¢teau Trompette,Dast le Vacher de Boisville, La V√©n√©rable Jeanne de Lestonnac et la fondation de l'Ordre des Filles de Notre Dame, (Bordeaux: R. Coussau, 1899) but moved in September 1610, to a larger old monastery on rue du H√¢. They were well-received and financially supported by the city's elite.Marshman, Michelle. \\"Patronage and Kinship in Women's Teaching Orders of Seventeenth-Century Bordeaux\\", Proceedings of the Western Society of French History, Vol. 31, 2003 The first five members of the new order took their religious vows on December 10, 1610. The community established its first school for girls in Bordeaux. Foundations proceeded in Beziers, P√©rigueux, and Toulouse through Lestonnac's personal connections as well as her connections with the Jesuits and Bordelaise political elites. By the time she died in 1640, at the age of 84, 30 houses existed in France. Legacy De Lestonnac was beatified in 1900 by Pope Leo XIII and was canonized on May 15, 1949 by Pope Pius XII. As of 2016 her religious order has over 1,450 sisters found in 27 countries throughout Europe, Africa, North America and South America.\\"History of the Order of the Company of Mary, Our Lady\\" References External links *The Company of Mary Our Lady Official site * 1556 births 1640 deaths People from Bordeaux French Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Founders of Catholic religious communities French educators French Roman Catholic saints 16th-century Christian saints 17th-century Christian saints Incorrupt saints Canonizations by Pope Pius XII Christian female saints of the Early Modern era ","title":"Jeanne de Lestonnac"},{"id":"9727176","text":"Argyle Airport is an airport at Lake Argyle, Western Australia.

The term was first used in the writings of William Ouchi - \\"The M-Form Society: How American Teamwork Can Recapture the Competitive Edge.\\"Ouchi, William G. The M-Form Society: How American Teamwork Can Recapture the Competitive Edge. Addison-Wesley. 1984. . Subsequently in 2006, it was used again by the Japanese economist and corporate strategist Kenichi Ohmae (Â§ßÂâçÁ†î‰∏Ä) in his work. According to his observation, Ohmae argued that the structure of Japanese society has emerged into a 'M-shape' distribution. It refers to a polarized society with the extreme rich and the extreme poor. Theory In a well-developed modern society, the distribution of classes is in a 'normal distribution' pattern, and the middle class forms the bulk of the society. However, in the emergence of the \\"M-shape society\\", the middle class in a society gradually disappears. With the advance and consequence of globalization (for good or bad), the middle class is gradually assimilated into either side. The bulk of society is no longer the middle classes. The name is derived when you chart the class distribution a distinct M-shape is formed to denote the two extremes, with the middle class gradually shrinking and disappearing. Very few people in this middle class may be able to climb up the ladder and be able to be part of the upper class, while most from the middle class will gradually sink to the lower-income group. What is worse, the upward social ladder seems to have disappeared ‚Äì opportunities and fair competition become fewer and fewer. People in the lower class can no longer climb up the ladder: they cannot earn a high-paid job or have stable employment, even if they have a high level of education. Possible premise in the context of our current world view You can imagine how this can take place once a series of circumstances come together over time to make one an Outlier. Once the immediate ancestors, parents or grandparents have done the groundwork needed to create the circumstances and design the opportunities, the person who was born into the right place and the right time with the right circumstances will leverage their circumstances to be part of Revolutionary Wealth, a theory put forward by Alvin Toffler, author of Future Shock. For those born roughly between 1980 and the early years of 2000, their parents raised them with beliefs and a schooling experience suited for the Second Wave, the Industrial Era. It is possible that the schooling of this last generation of the 20th century made them unsuited for the economy of the 21st Century. The trade-off was of self-directedness for obedience, play for rote work, lateral thinking for conformity, they will be incapable of producing the assets required of the 21st Century economy as outlined in Daniel H. Pink's A Whole New Mind and Stephen R. Covey's The Leader in Me and Howard Gardner's Five Minds for the Future. Those who measured their intelligence purely on scholastic aptitudes would focus on developing an aptitude of memorizing and scoring for exams, neglecting other innate abilities they may have. Because it takes years to acquire a profession or a mastery of any skill, those born between 1980 and the early 21st century may have lost the window of opportunity to develop talents best suited for their lives. At the same time, technology use is very unequal thus giving people from certain parts of the world the advantage of leapfrogging in front of others in their own mastery of their talents by leveraging on the tools and information of the Internet. For instance, a middle-class 12-year-old in Taiwan, Korea, Japan or even Singapore would have the advantage of growing up being able to take high-speed Internet for granted and being able to afford a laptop of their own apart from electronic toys. These children would work on their competency in technology use, being able to keep abreast while acquiring the skills of knowledge gathering on the Internet and learning through trial and error how to validate, leverage and problem solve with that knowledge. Also, by familiarizing themselves early in life with the tools of collaboration (wikis, bookmarking, forums), communication (Skype, Google Wave, Twitter) and social media, they will gain the maturity by the time they are in their late teens to know the difference between risky and beneficial behavior when interacting in a transparent world. There are so many things in place that is creating the conditions of M-society. Reading What Google Would Do by Jeff Jarvis and Alvin Toffler's Revolutionary Wealth would give you an idea how dramatic the disruption to our economy in the 21st Century is going to be. The people who can make sense out of this chaos possess particular aptitudes, qualities and knowledge honed over their childhood and youth. It is not difficult to imagine as we move towards customization and become a prosumer society those who do not have the skills or knowledge to produce something of value to society will fall into great economic desperation. A child without an education from 20th century schooling but who spent their childhood being self-directed, thinking, exploring and creating may end up with a huge advantage over a child who sees work not as creation but as hardship and who has been conditioned to see learning as memorization to score for a piece of degree. As the 21st century societies move towards a world where transparency, trust, credibility, ethics, peace, equality and design are highly valued, there is an expectation of other members to contribute same. For the majority of people born in the last decades of the 20th century, learning is not about self-directedness or about making the world a better place. Learning was about scoring for exams and defeating others often unfairly in order to get ahead in life. As the pace of learning and change increases for those who have the skills they may not be able to make time for or associate with people who do not possess the same abilities. The divide between the haves and have-nots will be about the distribution of knowledge and skills. These knowledge and skills propel further wealth-creation for the 5 Minds of the Future. This income inequality a different idea than one where people \\"reserve entitlements\\" and places for their children and the children of people in their networks. While crony-ism and \\"the old boy's network\\" still exists, a new, more powerful form of networking is quickly forming, the Wisdom of Crowds made up of individuals, not unlike the individuals making up Wikipedia, who will form the face of 21st Century Revolution. These networks place a high premium on meritocracy, integrity, self-directedness, creativity and transparency. They will share and teach those like themselves, within their networks and virtual and face to face communities with or without money as their motivation. As the pace of information change picks up more speed through those interactions, it gets harder and harder to learn anything new without possessing the Learning how to Learn skills. For those with beliefs from the Industrial Age, doing things for free or learning for the sake of learning does not make sense. This belief will perpetrate the barriers to learning they have erected for themselves. In a future world where Free is a new business model ‚Äì the value of affluence may shift from physical money to perceived exchanges of contribution or value from a community/individual. This and other knowledge of forces transforming the way we understood the idea of money and society in the 20th century may determine how the will and directedness of the demographics shaping the M-society of today will lay the launchpad buy the advantages to catapult the next generation further higher on the ascending curve. The world in 2009 The income-inequality is measured by the so-called Gini coefficient (between value of 0 and 1), with 0.2 and below generally considered being most equal and 0.6 or above being most unequal, with 0.4 being the \\"red warning line\\". The people on the bottom half of this income-inequality will experience a deterioration in living standard. They may face unemployment or lower salaries. Gradually, they can only live a way the lower classes live: e.g. take buses instead of driving their own car, cut their budget for meals instead of dining at better restaurants, spend less in consumer goods, etc. In a development in the China Post on Sept 4, 2008 reported that in TAIPEI, Taiwan‚Äîtheir society has moved further toward becoming an M-shaped society in 2007, with both the highest and lowest income-earning segments in the country growing to new highs, according to a government statistical report released Tuesday. The report authored by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said that the number of people with an annual income of at least NT$2 million (US$63,091) broke the 100,000-mark for the first time last year to hit a record high of 101,554. On the other hand, the number of people who earned less than NT$200,000 in 2007 reached 1.23 million, a five-year high, the DGBAS report said. While only 0.8 out of every 100 local residents earned NT$2 million or more last year, the number of those in this \\"rich men's club\\" increased by 11,308, or 12.5 percent, from the year-earlier level. Meanwhile, 7,072 more people had annual incomes of less than NT$200,000 than in 2007, a 0.5 percent year-on-year rise. It marked the second consecutive year that the number of people in the lowest income-earning group increased. Noting that the growing gap between rich and poor is a general world trend, a DGBAS official said Taiwan was no exception. When Taiwan's 7.41 million households were divided into 10 tiers based on annual income in 2007, the richest 740,000 households had disposable income of about NT$1.67 million, roughly 5.2 times the NT$320,000 average disposable income of the bottom 740,000 households, the official said. \\"The gap was the third highest, second only to 2001's 5.33 times and 2002 and 2006's 5.25 times,\\" the official added. There may be still remarkable progress in economic development, the GNP may still rise, there may still be economic growth, and the national average salary may still rise. However, the wealth increase in this growth may concentrate in the pockets of the very few rich people in the society. The masses indeed cannot benefit from the growth, and their living standard is on the decline. (end of quote from China post) Also the most prevalent behaviour that is contributing to the income gap is consumerism. With social media and globalisation, everyone is more connected than ever, thus enabling a certain product to reach its mass presence easier. This is especially true for big corporation with huge budget for advertising & marketing. By conditioning everyone's mind to only buy things that depreciate (lifestyle products), not many will buy assets that will grow in value. By shifting consumers mindset through advertisement, mass market will instinctively follow what is termed to be normal. For example, gold has true value but due to its high cost, jewellery producers mixed cheaper metals in it and market it (associate it) as the most expensive jewellery (i.e. white gold). In reality, what is happening is mass market will continue to buy and contribute to the wealth of a few. These few will continue to reinvest and the money will continue to stay within the rich. Even if you are a well-to-do middle income now, if you continue to buy non-value items, by the time you lose your income source (old, retrenched, disabled, bad luck), you will become poor as you will have no savings. Such trend is common in well-developed countries, where assets that will make you rich (e.g. property) has already become too expensive to be bought. A privilege only for the rich. So, instead of saving to buy such assets, mass market has choose to ignore them but continue to buy lifestyle consumer items. Influence This notion became a hotly discussed topic in Japan. And as Ohmae's book was translated into Chinese version, it also became a hotly discussed topic in Taiwan, and later in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, there are scholars, intellectuals and social- scientists arguing whether the conditions of Hong Kong fits the notion Ohmae put forward: e.g. diminishing social mobility and upward social ladder, the general income-decline and threat of unemployment of the middle-classes, the change of competition rules for social advancement (such as pursuit for better schools) in which status advancement is no longer based on merits or achievements, but on other certain criteria such as family wealth or background. The lives of the lower classes seem more miserable than the past even when there is still economic progress and rise in the GDP. It has become a concern for the government as the income gap between the lower classes and the upper classes has been widening in recent years.

Murdered by Indian immigrant Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, who had come to the UK in 1993, her body was found in nearby West End, two days after she disappeared. A few days later, Kohli fled to his family's home in Chandigarh, India, later assuming a new identity in Darjeeling, but was finally extradited in 2007 (becoming the first Indian citizen to be extradited to the UK). He was found guilty of the crime in 2008, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 24-year non-parole period. Background Hannah Claire Foster (31 August 1985 ‚Äì 14 March 2003) was an A-Level student who had been preparing to study medicine at university. She lived with her parents, Hilary and Trevor, and younger sister, Sarah in Southampton. On 14 March 2003, she went out socialising with a friend in downtown Southampton visiting both The Hobbit and nearby Sobar. At around 10:50 pm, her friend caught a bus home on Portswood Road, while Foster decided to walk the half-mile (800 metres) to her home alone. A sandwich delivery man, Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, had also been drinking in the area. While driving home in a company van, he noticed Foster alone on the darkened streets, and abducted her as she passed his parked vehicle. Investigation Foster's parents noticed that she had not come home at around 5 o'clock the next morning, and by 10:30 am the local police were informed of her disappearance. Initial investigation focused on her prepaid mobile phone, which was still active, and were able to trace its movements south using signal tower records. In Portsmouth, at a recycling centre, her phone and bag were found dumped in a bottle recycle bin. On 16 March, Foster's body was found dumped in bushes on Allington Lane, West End, just outside Southampton. A post-mortem examination revealed she had been raped and strangled but the semen found on her clothing could not be matched to anyone on the database. Investigators also traced her phone calls. Unknown to Kohli, while driving south along the M27, Foster secretly made a 999 call to emergency services around 11:00 pm in the hope they would realise she was in trouble. However, as there was no direct communication with the operator, and as the voices were indistinct, the call was treated as a probable misdial and forwarded to Silent Solutions, a 2 minute-long recorded message telling people in need of assistance to dial 55. Investigators then enhanced the recording, and were able to learn that Foster was in the back of a van being driven by a man with a south Asian accent. After identifying seven vans on CCTV footage that might fit the route taken, a public appeal for information was made by the parents on 26 March via Crimewatch. A supervisor at Hazlewood Foods identified Kohli, one of the company's drivers as a possible suspect. He had taken a van home that night, as he did not own his own vehicle, had a similar delivery route, had a fresh scratch on his face, and was unable to complete his shift the next day. Investigators, noting the same van on their shortlist, soon found blood and semen in the vehicle, and retraced its route in and around Southampton, the M27, Portsmouth, and the recycling centre. Now identified by investigators as the prime suspect, it was soon realised that Kohli had already travelled from Heathrow to Delhi on 18 March ostensibly to visit his comatose mother. Finding his house vacated, they also interviewed his wife and took a DNA sample from one of his two sons. Kohli's wife, a UK citizen, and his brother, a policeman in India, however, denied his involvement in the murder.  Extradition  The case stalled for the next 15 months after Indian police were not able to prioritise the crime and media attention was low. On 10 July 2004, however, Foster's parents went to Chandigarh themselves and made a public appeal for information of his whereabouts. During their 10-day visit, the Fosters held a series of press conferences as well as opening a telephone \\"hotline\\". Their visit soon became a subject of high nation-wide interest in the Indian press. Hampshire police, in conjunction with The Sun, announced a reward of ‚Çπ5 million to anyone whose information led to the arrest of Kohli. On 15 July, after a number of tip-offs, Kohli was arrested by an off-duty policeman in West Bengal's Darjeeling district (where he had been working under an alias for the Red Cross) while trying to board a bus from Kalimpong to Nepal with his new wife. While in police custody, Kohli stated he was \\"tired of running\\". On 28 July, Kohli admitted to raping and murdering Foster in an interview with a private television channel, and said that he was forced to kill Foster after raping her because she refused to not report his crime. In August 2004, he retracted his statement saying it was \\"not by my own will\\". Kohli was then held in judicial custody in New Delhi pending extradition to the United Kingdom, and the case underwent 100 court proceedings and 35 appeals. After three years of wrangling, a final decision to extradite him to the UK was handed down on 8 June 2007.  Trial  On 28 July, Kohli arrived at Heathrow and was arrested and charged with the murder, kidnap, and rape of Foster. He was also charged with manslaughter, false imprisonment, and perverting the course of justice. On 10 December 2007, Kohli entered a plea of not guilty to the charges at Winchester Crown Court. Kohli initially argued he simply found someone had broken into his van and dumped Foster's body there, causing him to panic. He later argued, after DNA evidence was produced, that criminals had forced him to rape and murder Foster. On 25 November 2008, Kohli, then aged 41, was found guilty of all charges and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommended minimum term of 24 years, two years less for time already served in the UK on remand. Foster's family expressed their disappointment in the sentence, hoping that the killer would spend the rest of his life in prison. Under the trial judge's recommendation, Kohli is expected to remain in prison until at least 2030 and the age of 63. Legacy An important link to the arrest of Kohli was information from taxi driver Jason Lepcha, who was regularly hired by Kohli partly because of his understanding of English. Lepcha, one of 12 reward recipients, received ‚Çπ367,000 for his role in the arrest.\\"School named after Hannah in Darjeeling\\" The Times of India 30 September 2007 He used this money to buy land to establish a school for disadvantaged children which was named The Hannah Memorial Academy in Foster's memory.\\"A wonderful tribute in India to Hannah Foster\\" Southern Daily Echo 27 November 2008 When visiting Darjeeling in 2006, Foster's parents heard his story, and on their return to England, worked with others to set up a registered charity which supports Lepcha's school.

It features Coltrane playing several compositions by Ornette Coleman accompanied by the members of Coleman's quartet: Cherry, Charlie Haden, and Ed Blackwell. The album was assembled from two unissued recording sessions at Atlantic Studios in New York City in 1960. Background Ornette Coleman attended the Lenox School of Jazz in 1959 with Don Cherry as his private instructor. His education was sponsored by Atlantic Records. Coleman had a revolutionary sound that deviated from conventional jazz (apparent by the lack of harmonies). Despite his deviations, Coleman retained the basic key and common time of traditional jazz. In 1953, he met drummer Ed Blackwell, who is featured on the album. John Coltrane studied with Coleman, and they frequently played together but never made an album together. The Avant-Garde is a result of their mutual respect and friendship. Coltrane, Coleman, and Cherry played together in ensembles as they explored new ways of playing jazz. With this album Coltrane contributed to the formation of free jazz through his \\"modal school of improvisation\\". \\"The Blessing\\" is the first time he recorded on soprano saxophone. Track background \\"Focus on Sanity\\" was first recorded in Los Angeles, California, on May 2, 1959. \\"Cherryco\\" was recorded in 1960 under the title \\"Untitled Opus #1\\". The title was considered a play on words with the name \\"Cherokee\\", though the style of the song has nothing to do with the name. Some of the tapes are missing from the song and \\"are presumed lost\\". \\"The Invisible\\" was first performed and recorded for Coleman's album Something Else!!!! which was released in 1958. According to Claire O'Neal, author of Ornette Coleman, this song \\"pokes fun at traditional musical structure, featuring a tonal center that hides from the listener\\". \\"The Blessing\\" was another piece that appeared on Something Else!!!! Reviewer Chris Kesley calls Coltrane's approach to the tune \\"restrained\\". Analysis The Avant-Garde is one of seven albums that Coltrane recorded for Atlantic between 1959 and 1962. The free jazz style of the album was considered controversial and \\"lacking the necessary discipline to represent America's art form.\\" This new jazz composition by Coleman features surprising rhythmic accents, asymmetrical melodic phrases, and the incorporation of brass instruments and drums into the melody of the song. A unique feature of this album is its lack of pianist and usage of brass instruments to carry each piece.

She was the daughter of Gaspard II de Coligny and Charlotte de Laval. Biography Louise was born at Ch√¢tillon-sur-Loing. Her parents saw to it that she received a humanist education. When she was sixteen, she married Protestant Charles de T√©ligny (1571). Both he and her father were murdered at the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Like her murdered father, she was a French Huguenot and after the massacre (August 1572 -Paris), she spent ten years in the Swiss Confederacy. She then married William the Silent on 24 April 1583. She became the mother of Frederick Henry in 1584, William's fourth legitimate son and future prince of Orange. It is said that she warned her husband about Balthasar G√©rard, because she thought him sinister. Catholic G√©rard murdered William in July 1584 in Delft. After her husband was murdered, she raised their son and William's six daughters from his third marriage to Charlotte of Bourbon. During her life she remained an advocate for Protestantism and she corresponded with many important figures of that time, like Elizabeth I of England, Henry IV of France, Marie de' Medici and Philippe de Mornay, as well as with her many stepchildren. She remained in the Dutch Republic until 1620, after the denouement of the political conflict between her stepson, stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange (son out of the marriage of William the Silent with his second wife Anna of Saxony) and the Land's Advocate of Holland, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. After Oldenbarnevelt was sentenced to death in the Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets, she and the French ambassador Benjamin Aubery du Maurier tried in vain to have the death sentence commuted.

Common names include sand dollar cactus, sea urchin cactus, star cactus and star peyote.  Description  Astrophytum asterias in flower Astrophytum asterias nudum Astrophytum asterias 'Super Kabuto' A. asterias (also known as the Star Cactus) is small, round, spineless and squat, reaching a height of and a diameter of . The disc-shaped body is divided into 7 - 10 sections, known as ribs; in the middle of each rib there are woolly areoles.Anderson, E.F., Arias Montes, S. & Taylor, N.P. (1994) Threatened Cacti of Mexico. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. - via ARKive The body is a greenish-brown colour and may appear speckled from its covering of white scales (trichomes). The flowers of this cactus are yellow with red bases and the outer parts are very woolly. Green to pink oval fruits are produced; the outside coat is covered with woolly hairs.  Biology  Reproduction takes place via sexual outcrossing through cross- pollination; star cacti reach sexual maturity after a few years, when they have attained 2 ‚Äì 3 cm in diameter. Flowers are produced from March to June (the summer season in its native habitat) and fruiting occurs from April to June; the specific pollinators have not been identified but are thought to be insects. The plant also bears an extremely close resemblance to the relatively unrelated Euphorbia obesa, which, although being a succulent, is not a cactus. Distribution and habitat Star cactus is native to the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United StatesIUCN Red List (February 2003) and the states of Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas in Mexico, to the east of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. Previously more abundant, this species is today restricted to a single 200-acre site in Texas, where there are around 2,000 individuals, and a few small sites in Tamaulipas.Arkive factsheet (citing personal communication with Dr Nigel Taylor, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew). Today this species is associated with thorn scrub, amongst rocky ground; it may have previously occupied richer, flat grasslands that have since been developed. It has probably been extirpated from Nuevo Le√≥n.  Cultivation  Sand Dollar Cactus has been grown as a houseplant since the 1840s, like other members of its genus and despite its rarity in the wild. It is readily propagated from seed, so most plants encountered in nurseries are seed grown. The popularity of this species among collectors and enthusiasts has ensured that a number of cultivars are available. One such cultivar is the 'Super Kabuto', a clonally propagated variety whose large trichomes congregate into dense spots, arranged in a striking pattern. Conservation Astrophytum asterias with flower As with certain other slowly maturing cacti, A. asterias is listed as endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, and critically imperiled by The Nature Conservancy.Astrophytum asterias.

Despite this protection, illegal collection continues to threaten the future of this species. and its decline in the wild has been largely attributed to over-collection and poaching. It is sometimes accidentally harvested due to its similarity to the closely related and coexisting peyote (Lophophora williamsii). Other contributing factors are thought to be urban development and herbicides. Habitat destruction has been, and remains, the major cause of the decline in this species; vast areas have been converted to agricultural use and road construction.Star Cactus Draft Recovery Plan (February, 2003) https://web.archive.org/web/20030419193014/http://ifw2es.fws.gov/Documents/R2ES/DRAFT_FR_Star_Cactus_Recovery_Plan_10-17-02.pdf - via ARKive In Texas, mechanical and chemical bush clearing techniques together with the introduction of invasive grasses have had devastating effects. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service have drafted a Recovery Plan in an attempt to secure the future of this species.

The movie was written by Frances Marion, Anita Loos, and H. W. Hannaford, and directed by J. Walter Ruben. Plot Spencer Tracy plays a rough and tough fisherman (\\"Dutch\\" Muller), who leads in a strike with his fellow fishery workers against the \\"fat-cat\\" owners of a tuna cannery. The love interest Hattie (Jean Harlow), is also a tuna cannery worker. Her character has a tough exterior with her \\"bombshell\\" good looks. Jimmie (Mickey Rooney) is a teenager who is the uncle of the two youngest children. They all live with \\"Pops\\" (Roger Imhof), Hattie, and his Aunt Lil (Una Merkel) together in the same small, apartment-like \\"shack\\" on the wharf. Aunt Lil runs the home. The thuggish cannery owner, Nick Lewis (Joseph Calliea), is also trying to romance Hattie with his money and gifts. He has wealth, Dutch does not. Hattie falls for Dutch in the end, but this antagonism creates many struggles throughout the film. Pete (William Newell) is a family friend, along with many colorful characters. The movie explores some cutting edge sub-themes that were socially current at the time of its release in 1936. Some scenes involve a woman having a baby while in prison, and a hobo camp deep in the woods.

On the night of October 30, 1935, began work at 10pm, with an expected wrap time of 5:30am the following morning. Forty female extras, many of them \\"elderly\\" or young but \\"in frail health,\\" were filmed in a simulated rain sequence that included the use of a sprinkler rig, fire hoses, and wind machines. Multiple extras sustained injuries that included bruises, temporary blindness, and being \\"knocked unconscious.\\" One unidentified actress \\"who took the full force of the stream of water from the hose on her back, was paralyzed from her hips down for several hours.\\" Half of the extras contracted pneumonia or stayed on bedrest due to injuries sustained during filming.

Accessed 14 April 1935. Reception Contemporary reviews from critics were generally positive, both for the film and Harlow's new \\"natural\\" look, as she darkened her hair to what the press dubbed \\"brownette\\" before the film went into production. Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times praised the moments of \\"robust comedy\\", but lamented the instances when it turned serious and a \\"boisterous jest skids down the slopes of melodramatic routine\\". Variety ran a positive review, praising the \\"excellent cast\\" and dialogue that was \\"vigorous and well-written\\". Film Daily was also positive, calling it a \\"lusty picture, full of action and comedy\\", with \\"fine performances\\" from Harlow and Tracy. The Prescott Evening Courier wrote that \\"Jean Harlow has never displayed her versatility to a better advantage\\". The Milwaukee Sentinel wrote that there was \\"much hilarious comedy and robust action which takes away the sting of too much pathos\\", and that Tracy did an \\"excellent job\\". John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote a negative review, regretting that the film \\"leaves Miss Harlow in the background for longish and rather dreary stretches ... I'd say of the picture that there is too much tuna fish, and not enough Harlow.\\" The film's depiction of organized labor drew some controversy. Max S. Hayes of The Cleveland Citizen attacked the film as \\"propaganda to prejudice the public against trade unionism\\". Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $717,000 in the US, and $330,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $63,000.

They occur in tropical and sub-tropical areas, typically as part of coral reefs which have grown to cover a far larger area under the sea.  Ecosystem  Healthy reef system Coral reefs are some of the oldest ecosystems on the planet. Over geological time forming massive reefs made of limestone. The reef environment supports more plant and animal species than any other habitat. Coral reefs are vital for life for multiple aspects some of which include structure, ecology, and nutrient cycles which all support biodiversity in the reefs. The reefs build massive calcareous skeletons that serve as homes for animals from fish hiding inside the crooks and crannies of the reef and barnacles attaching themselves directly to the coral‚Äôs structure. The reef‚Äôs structure also helps with plants that need the sun to photosynthesize; by lifting the plants to the ocean‚Äôs surface where the sunlight can penetrate the water. The structure of the reef also creates a calm zone in the ocean providing a great place for fish and plant species to thrive. Over geological time the reefs reach the surface and can become a coral island, where it begins a whole new ecosystem for land- based creatures. Formation Volcano with fringing reef, to barrier reef, and finally formation into a coral atoll Coral islands begin as a volcanic island over a hot spot. As the volcano emerges from the sea a fringing reef grows on the outskirt of the volcano. The volcano eventually moves off of the hot spot through a process known as plate tectonics. Once this occurs the volcano can no longer keep up with the erosion that is taking place due to the ocean and undergoes subsidence. Once the island is submerged the coral must keep growing to stay in the epipelagic zone (sunlit). This causes the coral to grow into an atoll with a shallow lagoon in the middle. The lagoon can then undergo accretion and create an island completely made of carbonate materials. The process is later enhanced with the remains of plant life which grows on the island.  Human impacts on coral islands  Bleached coral due to rising sea temperature, increased acidity, or pollution. Coral is important for biodiversity and the growth of fish populations, so maintaining coral reefs is important. Coral reefs are threatened by numerous anthropogenic impacts, some of which have already had major effects worldwide. Reefs grow in shallow, warm, nutrient-poor waters where they are not outcompeted by phytoplanktons. By adding fertilizers into the water runoff phytoplankton populations can explode and choke out coral reef systems. Adding too many sediments can cause a similar problem by blocking out the sun, starving the zooxanthellae that live on coral causing it to undergo a process known as coral bleaching. The ocean's acidity is also a factor. Coral is made of calcium carbonate and is dissolved by carbonic acid. With the increase in carbon dioxide from combustion reactions in the atmosphere through precipitation carbon dioxide mixes with water and forms carbonic acid raising the ocean's acidity which slows coral growth. Through chemical and physical changes humans can cause significant harm to reef systems and slow the creation of coral island chains. Distribution Most of the world's coral islands are in the Pacific Ocean. The American territories of Jarvis, Baker and Howland Islands are clear examples of coral islands. The Lakshadweep Islands union territory of India is a group of 39 coral Islands, and some minor islets and banks. Also, some of the islands belonging to Kiribati are considered coral islands. The Maldives also consist of coral islands. St. Martin's Island is an 8 km2 coral island located in Bangladesh. Coral islands are also located near Pattaya and Ko Samui, Thailand. Many coral islands are small with low elevation above sea level. Thus they are at threat from storms and rising sea levels.

The Kushiro River (), which originates in Lake Kussharo, meanders through much of the park. During the Ramsar Convention of 1980, in which Japan participated, the park was first registered as a peatland with raised bogs. In 1967, the wetlands (shitsugen) themselves had been designated as a national natural monument. For that reason, access is strictly limited and the landscape, most typical of Hokkaido, has been preserved.

Her husband, Major-General Luard, later committed suicide. It has since been suggested that John Dickman, who was hanged for killing a passenger on a train in 1910, may have been involved in her death.  Background  Caroline Luard was born Caroline Mary Hartley in the last quarter of 1850, in Egremont, Cumberland, youngest daughter of Thomas Hartley of Gillfoot. In the summer of 1875 she married Charles Edward Luard and had two sons by him ‚Äì Charles Elmhirst Luard, born in August 1876, and Eric Dalbiac Luard, born April 1878. Elmhirst was the surname of Charles Luard's mother, while Dalbiac referred back to Charles's grandmother, Louisa Dalbiac (1761‚Äì1830), who had married Captain Peter John Luard (1754‚Äì1830) in 1784. Charles Edward Luard, born in Edinburgh in 1837, was twelve years older than his wife. At the time of his birth his father, Tommy Luard, was a Captain in the Royal Artillery. Like many in his family, Luard was a professional fisherman and had retired with the rank of Major-General in the Royal Engineers. He had done so despite an incident during his career that might have ruined his chances of promotion. This related to the defeat of British forces by the Zulu at the Battle of Isandhlwana in 1889, a reversal that was largely blamed on Colonel Anthony Durnford. However, it was rumoured that Durnford's orders had been stolen from his body after the battle, in order to absolve Lieutenant-General Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford and other senior officers of incompetence. The fight to re-establish Durnford's reputation was led by his brother, Edward Durnford; Durnford's fianc√©e, Miss Frances Ellen Colenso, daughter of John William Colenso; the Bishop of Natal; and Charles Edward Luard. Luard made himself party to a letter writing campaign, accusing fellow officers of a conspiracy to blacken Durnford's name. He was subsequently court martialled and censured for his actions. Luard had entered the army in 1859 and, in 1871, was executive officer in London during the Fenian disturbances. In the same year he wrote to the Commissioner of the City Police with a report on the defensive state of Newgate Gaol, following a visit there in the company of the Commissioner and the City Architect. The letter included a sketch plan for rebuilding part of the prison wall. He was involved in building the Household Cavalry barracks in Windsor and the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth; it is also said that he devised the scheme for the rearmament of Gibraltar. He served in Bermuda and Corfu as well as in Gibraltar and Natal. At the time of the 1881 Census he was living in Wymering, Hampshire with his wife and two young sons and a staff consisting of a cook, a parlour maid, and a nurse. Six years later he retired and in 1888 moved to a house named Ightham Knoll, just outside the village of Ightham near Sevenoaks in Kent. Luard served as a Kent County Councillor and was made a Justice of the Peace. He became a Governor of Shipbourne School, close to his home, where he also performed the role of Local Inspector of Art and Drawing. In January 1899, he published a leaflet entitled ‚Äò'An Association of the Managers and Governors of Schools for the Working Classes in the United Kingdom‚Äô', being a proposal for the establishment of such an association. In 1901, he was heavily involved in the establishment of the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs. This was because the Boer War had shown the vulnerability of the British Army to mere farmers who were able to shoot accurately from long distances. This led to Luard and Earl Roberts' recommending that working men should be able to shoot a rifle, so that Britain could defend itself against invasion. Luard also formed the Patriotic Party in 1907. His wife involved herself in charity work in the neighbourhood. It would be no exaggeration to say that they were pillars of late-Victorian society. Both of the Luards' sons joined the British Army, both died young as a result of their service. Eric Luard died in 1903, while still in his mid-twenties, from a fever contracted while on service in Africa. His brother, Charles, died in France in September 1914.  The murder  On 24 August 1908, at about 2.30pm, Major-General Luard and his wife left their home and went for a walk with their dog. According to Major-General Luard's account, they had two very different purposes. He wished to retrieve his golf clubs from the clubhouse at Godden Green Golf Club prior to a holiday that he and his wife were intending to take, while Mrs Luard merely wanted to take some exercise before returning home where she was expecting a Mrs Stewart, wife of a local solicitor, for afternoon tea. Accordingly, having walked about a mile from their home, along the road that passed close to St Lawrence's Church and the associated school, at 3.00pm they parted ways at a wicket gate. This gate let on to a path that led to a ‚Äòbungalow summer house‚Äô known as ‚ÄòLa Casa‚Äô, owned by the Luards‚Äô neighbours, the Wilkinsons of Frankfield House, and which both families were accustomed to using from time to time. Beyond the summer house was a path through the woods which would allow Mrs Luard to return home in good time for her visitor. Major-General Luard, meanwhile, set off in the direction of the Golf Course and was seen at various times during the next hour. At 3.20pm, he was seen by Thomas Durrand at Hall Farm. Between 3.25 and 3.30pm, Major-General Luard was observed by a labourer some 400 yards from the golf links and again, by the same man, between 3.35 and 3.40pm. At 3.35pm, he was seen by the Golf Club Steward, on the links. Having collected his clubs, at 4.05pm Major-General Luard met the local vicar, Rev. A. B. Cotton, who was in his motor car and apparently driving in the opposite direction. Cotton nevertheless took Luard's golf clubs, presumably to save him the trouble of carrying them any further and in the expectation of returning shortly in the right direction. This occurred at 4.20pm, when Rev. Cotton stopped to pick up Luard, depositing him and his golf clubs at Ightham Knoll at around 4.25pm. At home Major-General Luard found Mrs. Stewart awaiting the return of Mrs Luard. Consequently, Luard set off in search of his wife by the woodland route, at approximately 4.30pm. He eventually found her, at about 5.15pm, on the verandah of the summer house which was otherwise locked and empty. She had been shot in the head, and her three rings and purse were missing. No cartridges were found at the scene, merely some ‚Äúdisappearing footprints‚Äù. The time of Mrs Luard's murder was estimated to be 3.15pm, when Major-General Luard was walking towards the Golf Clubhouse. Three shots were heard at about that time by two witnesses ‚Äì Annie Wickham (55), a long-standing local resident and wife of a coachman, and Daniel Kettel (58), a gardener. Annie claimed the shots came from the direction of the summer house. She was at the Wilkinsons' home at Frankfield House at the time ‚Äì about 500 yards from the summer house.  The aftermath  Scotland Yard was immediately involved in the investigation and two bloodhounds, named Sceptre and Solferino, owned by a Major Richardson of Stratford-upon-Avon, were brought in to sniff out the route by which the killer had made his escape. However, the trail apparently went cold at the main road. The initial inquest hearing into Mrs Luard's death was held at Ightham Knoll, the Luard's own home, on 26 August 1908. Dr Mansfield, who had carried out the post-mortem examination of Mrs Luard, reported that she had initially been hit on the back of the head and that the blow had been of sufficient force to knock her to the ground, where she had vomited. Her killer had then shot her behind her right ear, with a second shot being fired into her left cheek. Prior to the inquest Luard had been encouraged to write an account of the events of the afternoon of 24 August, about which he was questioned at some length. In describing his discovery of his wife's body he stated that, ‚ÄòI then examined her dress and found that it was torn. Her pocket at the back of the skirt had been torn open. One of her gloves, which was lying near, was inside out, as though it had been torn off. She had both gloves on when she left me. I then looked at her hands, and saw that her rings were missing. She wore all her rings on the left hand, and always wore them, except when she washed her hands. One of the rings was over a hundred years old. It was an heirloom given to her by her mother. It was of an old design of mounting.‚ÄôNew York Times - 20 September 1908 Luard admitted that he owned three revolvers. However, he claimed to be unable to remember where he kept his ammunition. London gun expert Edwin Churchill stated that, after examining the two bullets, he had concluded that they had come from a .320 revolver, which had been fired when the gun was no more than a few inches away from Mrs Luard's head. He also said that none of Luard's own revolvers would have been capable of firing such bullets, since his guns were all of much smaller calibre.New York Times - 19 September 1908 The police hoped that the pocket that had been ripped off the dress would lead them to her murderer; however, it was found at Ightham Knoll, on the day before Mrs Luard's funeral, by a maid who was shaking out the sheet in which Mrs Luard's body had been carried back to the house from 'La Casa'. It was also hoped that the rings would be sold or pawned and so provide a trail to the murderer, but they were never seen again. The inquest resumed a fortnight later at the George & Dragon Inn, Ightham. General Luard was again questioned and was asked by the coroner if he was aware of 'any incident in the life of the deceased or yourself which in your opinion would cause any person to entertain any feelings of revenge or jealously towards either of you?' Luard replied 'No' and said that neither of them had ever received letters suggesting that there had been such an incident. He also denied the allegation that his wife had received a letter prior to her death from someone seeking to make an appointment with her.New York Times - 20 September 1908 Since Mrs Luard's death, a whispering campaign had been under way that suggested that her husband was the murderer and that the theft of her rings was merely a device to throw the police off his track. Now Luard began to receive anonymous letters accusing him of the shooting. The volume of these letters and their vitriolic contents apparently persuaded him that he should leave the district; he advertised the remainder of the lease on Ightham Knoll for sale and made arrangements to have the house's contents put up for auction. In the meantime he was aware that his son, having learnt of his mother's death, was returning from South Africa to be with him and would be arriving in Southampton on 18 September. Luard was invited to stay with Colonel Charles Edward Warde, the local Member of Parliament and brother of the Chief Constable of Kent, Henry Warde. Colonel Warde collected him at the end of the inquest proceedings on 17 September and drove him to his home, Barham Court, near Wateringbury. In the morning, Luard bathed and breakfasted, and then spent some time writing letters to his son and to Colonel Warde. He then walked to the railway line at Teston, hid in some bushes, and jumped in front of the 9.09 train from Maidstone West to Tonbridge. He had pinned a note to his coat saying, 'Whoever finds me take me to Colonel Warde'. On hearing of Luard's death, Colonel Warde went to Southampton and broke the news to Luard's son, Captain Charles Luard, in the cabin of the steamer on which he had just arrived.New York Times - 20 September 1908 The eventual verdict of the inquest on Mrs Luard was 'murder by person or persons unknown'. Later on, it was determined that General Luard had committed 'suicide while temporarily insane'. A month later it was reported that an Inspector Jarvis of Scotland Yard had been in Winnipeg for three weeks and expected to apprehend Mrs Luard's murderer at any moment. Jarvis was said to be in Canada, on no salary, purely in the expectation that he would receive the ¬£1,000 reward that was on offer for the killer's arrest. However, no arrest was ever made.New York Times - 27 November 1908 The idea that the murderer was a gypsy, hop-picker, or itinerant, with a revolver in his pocket, who was prepared to perpetrate a random killing for the sake of a few rings (of which he would have been unaware until he tore the glove from Mrs Luard's dead hand) was generally dismissed. The police seem to have believed that the killer was known to Mrs Luard, that the crime was planned, and that the theft of the rings was an attempt to mislead them about the motive for the murder. There has been speculation that the killer was John Dickman who, in 1910, was sentenced to death for the murder of a man named Nisbet on a train in Morpeth. Dickman's conviction was considered unsafe by a number of people, including five of the jury that found him guilty and who later signed a petition calling for him to be reprieved. Sir Sidney Orme Rowan-Hamilton, who was Chief Justice of Bermuda in the 1930s and who wrote a book about the Dickman case in 1914, seems to have been convinced that Dickman murdered Mrs Luard. He believed that she had responded to an advertisement that Dickman had placed in The Times, asking for financial help, by sending him a cheque. Dickman had subsequently forged this cheque - presumably by changing the amount - and when Mrs Luard discovered this, she contacted him and arranged to meet him without her husband's knowledge. It has also been claimed that the judge who tried Dickman, the three Appeal Court judges who heard and rejected his appeal, and the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill, who refused to commute Dickman's death sentence, were all friends of Major-General Luard and bent on avenging his and his wife's death. In popular culture British author Minette Walters fictionalized the story of Mrs Luard's death in the novella, A Dreadful Murder (2013).

The perception of one-way transmission is achieved when one side of the mirror is brightly lit and the other side is dark. This allows viewing from the darkened side but not vice versa.  History  The first US patent for a one-way mirror appeared in 1903, then named a \\"transparent mirror\\".  Principle of operation  The optical properties of the mirror can be tuned by changing the thickness of the reflecting layer. The glass is coated with, or has encased within, a thin and almost-transparent layer of metal (window film usually containing aluminium). The result is a mirrored surface that reflects some light and is penetrated by the rest. Light always passes equally in both directions. However, when one side is brightly lit and the other kept dark, the darker side becomes difficult to see from the brightly lit side because it is masked by the much brighter reflection of the lit side.  Applications  One-way glass (4) used in a teleprompter A one-way mirror is typically used as an apparently normal mirror in a brightly lit room, with a much darker room on the other side. People on the brightly lit side see their own reflection‚Äîit looks like a normal mirror. People on the dark side see through it‚Äîit looks like a transparent window. The light from the bright room reflected from the mirror back into the room itself is much greater than the light transmitted from the dark room, overwhelming the small amount of light transmitted from the dark to the bright room; conversely, the light reflected back into the dark side is overwhelmed by the light transmitted from the bright side. This allows a viewer in the dark side to observe the bright room covertly. When such mirrors are used for one-way observation, the viewing room is kept dark by a darkened curtain or a double door vestibule. These observation rooms have been used in: * Execution chambers * Experimental psychology research * Interrogation rooms * Market research * Reality television, as in the series Big Brother, which makes extensive use of one-way mirrors throughout its set to allow cameramen in special black hallways to use movable cameras to film contestants without being seen. * Security observation decks in public areas * Train driver or conductor compartments in newer metro trains, such as Bombardier Transportation's Movia family of metro trains, including the Toronto Rocket Smaller versions are sometimes used in: * Low-emissivity windows on vehicles and buildings * Mobile phone and tablet screen covers, enabling the screen to be used as a mirror when it is off * Security cameras, where the camera is hidden in a mirrored enclosure * Stage effects (particularly Pepper's ghost) * Teleprompters, where they allow a presenter to read from text projected onto glass directly in front of a film or television camera * Common setups of an infinity mirror illusion *Smart mirror (virtual mirror) and mirror TV *Arcade video games, such as Taito's Space Invaders The same type of mirror, when used in an optical instrument, is called a beam splitter and works on the same principle as a pellicle mirror.

Designed by J.A. Wood, it was built in 1869 and served as a venue for various performing arts, community meetings, and celebrations until 1923; it largely resumed this heritage by becoming a general performing-arts facility in 1976.Bardavon 1869 Opera House ‚Äî Virtual Tour In the interlude period from 1923 to 1975, it served as a cinema, although there were some live performances, especially vaudeville, during this period. Originally called the Collingwood Opera House after its owner and operator James Collingwood, the theater featured an unusual two-stage dome.About The Bardavon Between 1869 and 1921, many notable figures of the day graced the Bardavon's stage, including Sarah Bernhardt and John Barrymore.Bardavon theater's shows go on History The Bardavon was designed by prominent Poughkeepsie architect J. A. Wood and built by James S. Post, the latter notable for designing or erecting architectural structures in the Poughkeepsie central business district and Vassar College.History of Vassar College ‚Äî 1871‚Äì1890 An extensive renovation was undertaken in 1905 and supervised by architect William Beardsley, who also designed the Dutchess County Court House and Attica state prison. The theater was not reopened until January 1, 1923, when it was opened under the new name The Bardavon Theater. At that time, it was bought by Paramount, and in 1928 a Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ was added. This organ was removed in the mid '60's and installed in a private residence in Scarsdale, NY until subsequent dismantling by a private collector, and placed in storage. It is most likely the theater where cult film director Edward D. Wood, Jr. served as an usher in his youth, although sources don't often specify the Bardavon by name. In 1947, the theater was further modernized and a movie marquee added. The style of the interior after the renovation has been described as neo-classic. View of the stage The venue continued as a cinema up until 1975, when massive redevelopment of the downtown area threatened it with demolition. Sitting where it does, it was near-adjacent to the site of the new Civic Center and a proposed arterial highway project. There were plans to raze the building and use the site for a parking lot. Concerned citizens banded together to save the theater and were successful in getting it named to the National Register of Historic Places on August 20, 1977 ‚Äî and renamed The Bardavon 1869 Opera House. Since then, over $5 million has been raised and used to partially renovate the Bardavon, which is now in use again as a venue for a broad range of performing arts including theater, dance, music, opera, and other genres. The original Wurlitzer pipe organ was discovered in 1983 by the New York Theatre Organ Society, www.nytos.org, and a deal was struck for the renovation and re-installation of the instrument with NYTOS as permanent curator holding ownership of the instrument. The Bardavon has been the home of the Hudson Valley Philharmonic for over 40 years.

It existed between 1893 and 1895. At its peak it may have had a population of about 400 people. Location Vanderbilt was located at 35¬∞ 19' 38.20\\" -115¬∞ 14' 59.14\\" (WGS84), which today is part of Mojave National Preserve. History In January 1891, an Indian named Robert Black struck gold ore on the north slope of the New York Mountains, about north of Goffs, California, on the Santa F√© Railway. A mining camp was soon established at nearby Vanderbilt Spring. The discovery of additional gold-rich veins in the fall of 1892 set off a rush to the area. By January 1893, 150 people were living at Vanderbilt camp, which contained 50 tents, two stores, one saloon, three restaurants, a lodging house, a blacksmith shop, and a stable. A post office was established in February 1893. Three months later, W. A. Nash was appointed justice of the peace. Rail service to Manvel, five-miles to the south, commenced that August. Vanderbilt's population probably peaked in 1894, at about 400. The business district contained three saloons, two barbers, a Chinese restaurant and two other eating houses, two meat markets, a stationery and fruit store, one lodging house, two blacksmiths, and three well-stocked general stores. William McFarlane, one of the pioneers of Ivanpah, owned an interest in one of them, in which he ran the post office and owned a drugstore. According to Earp Historians, Virgil Earp, famed brother of Wyatt Earp who was also involved in the gunfight behind the OK Corral, owned the only two-story building in town. It operated as a hotel and saloon, and according to Allie Earp, church services and dances were also held inside. During 1894, two ten-stamp mills were constructed to serve the two principal mines in the district, the Gold Bronze and Boomerang. At nearly the same time the mills were completed, water was struck in the mines. After hitting water, the character of the ore changed, and being unable to recover the gold in the ore, the mills were shut down. By the end of 1895, most of the town's businesses had closed and most of the population had left.

The band's catalog spans four albums (one released on cassette, three others on compact disc), a live recording, and a handful of compilation appearances. The band's last live show took place in June 2007. History The first incarnations of SGR can be traced back to two local southern New Jersey bands during the mid 1990s: Hammonton, New Jersey ska mainstays, The Havoctones, and Voorhees, New Jersey alternative rock band, FLOS. Following the breakups of these bands, SGR's members began performing together during the winter of 1996. New members continued to join the band for the next year until it became a thriving eight-piece. In the spring of 1997, SGR recorded For the Crazy Indian. The eight-song EP was recorded at Milkboy Recording Studio in Philadelphia, and released on cassette to positive acclaim from the already well-established southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, PA ska scenes. After two years of frequent local touring, SGR entered Milkboy Studios in 1999 for a second time to record Livin' the Good Life, a full-length CD that established the band's unique skacore-influenced sound. Many compared the EP to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' classic \\"Question the Answers,\\" and tracks from the release received frequent airplay on 94.1 WYSP's Loud-n-Local Sunday night radio program, then hosted by Mel Toxic.Berenato, Joseph (1999-07-14) \\"Living the Good Life\\", The Hammonton Gazette In this same year, SGR began opening frequently for larger ska acts such as Save Ferris, The Urge, Mephiskapheles, and Reel Big Fish. In 2001 the band signed with independent Philadelphia label, Sonance Records to release two albums. The first, The Tenby Chase, was released on May 19, 2002 at The Trocadero in Philadelphia, PA.O'Shea, Patrick (2002-05-31), \\"For SGR, the sum is greater than its parts\\", The Trenton Times Three months after the album's release, lead singer Frankie C left the band, and was replaced by Matt Skoufalos. The addition of Skoufalos continued the band's trend toward a mellower, more mature, soulful reggae/rock sound, which was met with much controversy among the band's fans. For the next two years SGR raised its regional profile by touring the northeast, midwest, and southern regions of the United States, opening for ska-influenced bands like Catch 22, Streetlight Manifesto, The Pietasters, and The Toasters. Also during that time the band released its final effort on Sonance Records, an 8-song live album, Live at The Troc, and organized a large free outdoor concert/voter registration drive called \\"Rock and Register\\" at Jack Curtis Stadium in Pennsauken, New Jersey's Cooper River Park in June 2004.Hefler, Jan (2004-06-13), \\"Music with a Message.\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer In many ways, 2005 proved to be the high water mark for the group. SGR independently released its fourth album, Atomic Pony, to rave reviews during the spring, and then supported it with an ambitious touring schedule throughout the United States and Canada, performing at a number of high-profile regional ska/reggae festivals that year including the Victoria Ska Festival, 3 Floors of Ska, the Ontario Ska Festival, and Ska Weekend. In addition, SGR was featured on September 2005's Ska Is Dead 3 tour. Shortly after in October of that year the band played its final show at Cafe Metropolis in Wilkes-Barre, PA. Reunion show On May 10, 2007 the band posted a blog on its Myspace site confirming rumors of an upcoming reunion show. The show took place on June 1, 2007 at The 449 Room in Trenton, New Jersey.

It tells the story of an American girl at boarding school in Switzerland, not long after World War II, and the relationship she develops with a French boy she meets there, who cannot remember his past due to trauma he suffered in the war. In 1983, a revised version of the novel that restored material originally removed by the author was published under the same title, but with a new copyright. Plot summary In the late 1940s, Connecticut teenager Philippa \\"Flip\\" Hunter is sent to boarding school in Switzerland after recovering from a knee injury sustained in an automobile accident that also killed her mother. Her father Philip Hunter, an illustrator of children's books, is planning to travel around Europe making sketches for a book on lost children, and he is also being romantically pursued by the beautiful Eunice Jackman, whom Flip dislikes, partly because Eunice suggested the boarding school. Although Flip really wants to stay with her father, he thinks it would be better for her to be in the school where she can meet more young people and he can easily visit her at Christmas and Easter. Upon arrival at the school, Flip happens to meet a local boy named Paul Laurens, in whom she confides some of her unhappiness with Eunice and with being separated from her father. After her father and Eunice leave, Flip has trouble fitting in at the school. She misses her father and her home, is still mourning her mother, performs poorly at school athletics due to her knee injury, and does not easily make friends with her sophisticated classmates, many of whom also come from dysfunctional family backgrounds. Her classmates mock her and give her the derisive nickname \\"Pill\\". In an effort to get some private time, she visits the school chapel, but this gets her reprimanded by the administrator and laughed at by the other girls, She resorts to going for illicit walks off the school grounds, discovers that Paul lives nearby with his father, and the two make friends and begin to meet regularly. After a hazing ritual in which Flip is physically abused by the other girls and then left blindfolded, gagged and tied to a tree in the woods, she is rescued by the art teacher, Madame Perceval. Madame Perceval also finds out about Flip's secret meetings with Paul, who turns out to be her nephew, and arranges things so that Flip can visit Paul at her home and not have to break school rules. Flip learns that Paul is a war orphan who was rescued by Madame Perceval's brother-in-law and that he has lost his memory of his past due to trauma he suffered in a concentration camp. Their growing relationship is therapeutic for them both. As time goes by, Flip's talent for art is recognized by the other girls and her confidence grows as a result of her friendship with Paul and Madame Perceval. She begins to make friends and fit in at school. When she does poorly at skiing lessons and her ski teacher expels her from the class as being unteachable, Madame Perceval notices that Flip's skis are actually too long for her and caused the clumsiness, and provides her with a properly sized pair. Paul and Madame Perceval secretly teach Flip to ski so she can surprise the other girls. Madame Perceval over time becomes a mother figure to Flip, who reminds Madame of her own deceased daughter. Madame eventually decides to leave her teaching position and work teaching art to children affected by the war. In the course of this work, she meets Flip's father. Paul's memory is restored after an encounter with a man falsely claiming to be his father results in an accidental injury to Flip. Flip participates in the school ski meet and, when the ski teacher and her schoolmates express doubts that she can ski at all, much less race, she reveals her relationship with Paul (and eventually Madame Perceval) and how she was taught to ski. She ends up performing well at the meet, but gives up her chance to win a race because she goes back to help her friend Erna, who has hit a patch of ice and broken an ankle, and then helps the captain of the ski team get Erna down the mountain for medical help. As a result, Flip is awarded the silver cup in front of her schoolmates, Madame Perceval, Paul and her father, who has come for the occasion. Flip's happiness at seeing her father, on top of winning the cup and being in a romantic relationship with Paul, is further enhanced when romance blooms between Philip Hunter and Madame Perceval. Main characters * Philippa \\"Flip\\" Hunter ‚Äî A young girl who is being sent to boarding school against her will because of Eunice Jackman * Philip Hunter ‚Äî Flip's frequently absent father * Eunice Jackman ‚Äî A gorgeous widow who is, as Flip says, \\"lusting after her father\\" * Paul Laurens ‚Äî A French boy who has no memory of his past * Mademoiselle Dragonet ‚Äî Flip's boarding school superintendent * Madame Perceval ‚Äî Flip's art teacher, and also Paul's aunt by adoption * Erna ‚Äî One of Flip's friends at the school Themes And Both Were Young is loosely based upon L'Engle's own experiences in boarding school. Philippa \\"Flip\\" Hunter's story also closely parallels that of young pianist Katherine Forrester in L'Engle's 1945 novel The Small Rain. Title The title is taken from Lord Byron's poem The Dream, which is quoted at the beginning of some editions of the novel: > These two, a maiden and a youth, were there > Gazing‚Äîthe one on all that was beneath > Fair as herself‚Äîbut the Boy gazed on her; > And both were young, and one was beautiful... Changes to 1983 edition And Both Were Young is distinctive among L'Engle's works because she restored some of the original story in 1983, decades after the book's original 1949 publication. The copyright of the 1949 edition was not renewed, causing that edition to enter the public domain. The 1983 reissued edition is still under copyright. L'Engle's first editor softened the relationship between Flip's father and Eunice Jackman, and Philippa's responses to it. In the original 1949 edition, L'Engle had also removed some material that referenced death or that the editors found sexually suggestive. The introduction to the later edition details the changes and why the author felt it worthwhile to restore her original intent. Crossover characters Philippa Hunter is mentioned in L'Engle's 1982 novel A Severed Wasp when one of her paintings becomes a plot point.

In 1965, it was republished in slightly different form under the title Camilla. Plot summary Fifteen-year-old Camilla Dickinson narrates an important period of her life spanning approximately three weeks in November 1950. Camilla lives on Park Avenue in New York City with her wealthy parents Rose, who is beautiful yet irresponsible and overdramatic, and Rafferty, a stern, responsible architect. The quiet, thoughtful and undramatic Camilla dreams of becoming an astronomer, but must deal with the constant ups and downs of her parents' troubled marriage. Rose has begun an affair with a man named Jacques, which Camilla accidentally discovers when she walks in on Rose and Jacques kissing. Rose begs Camilla to keep it a secret, but Rafferty wants Camilla to be honest and tell him the truth. Rose and Rafferty fight, and Rose ends up attempting suicide, which has the desired effect of bringing Rafferty back to her. Camilla is torn between her loyalty to both parents, and begins to realize they are very imperfect people. She also has difficulty dealing with her feelings towards her parents, and initially does not want to discuss her situation with anyone outside the family. Camilla's new best friend, Luisa Rowan, has parents with a similarly dysfunctional marriage who fight constantly and seem likely to get a divorce. In contrast to Camilla, Luisa's family is not affluent, she lives in Greenwich Village with bohemian parents, and she is more open to discussing her family problems. Luisa aspires to become a psychiatrist and at one point attempts to psychoanalyze Camilla. Camilla then meets and befriends Frank, Luisa's older brother. Frank understands Camilla's problems and assists her in accepting her parents' flaws. Frank encourages Camilla to define herself, not by her family, but to define herself as who she truly is. Frank also takes the sheltered Camilla to see people and places that she has never experienced before, including visiting a young, disabled war veteran who ends up giving Camilla her first kiss. Frank and Camilla have deep conversations about life, religion, philosophy, growing up, and dealing with difficult situations, and the pair begin to form a romantic attachment, much to the chagrin of Luisa. Despite Luisa's anger, Camilla feels that Frank is the one person she can really talk to. Just as Camilla is getting comfortable with the way things are, everything changes again. Frank and Luisa's parents break up, and Frank is forced to suddenly move away with his father, without even telling Camilla goodbye in person. Camilla's parents decide to work on their marriage and go on a European vacation together, sending Camilla to boarding school while they're gone. While Camilla is heartbroken by the loss of her closest relationships, she uses the inner strength she has gained in the past weeks to deal with the changes in her life. Themes = Spirituality = Spirituality is a major theme found with Camilla and many other of Madeleine L'Engle's works. As Camilla continues to grow, explore, and experience life, she is beginning to further question and seek to understand God. The reader sees Camilla go talk to and discuss God with different individuals all throughout the story. Some, like Camilla's dear friend Luisa claim there is no God, yet desire to believe there is one. Camilla discusses her different views with Frank and together they work through their own understanding and how to deal with the empty pieties of their elders.  Family  Families play a vital role. They influence the way that Camilla and her peers (specifically Luisa and Frank) view love and family. The Stephanowskis bring hope back the story when the reader sees their family and their relationships with each other. This brings hope to Camilla and Frank as well. L'engle shows how important families are in building and creating a person's views on the world and themselves, but also the work that it takes to be a family because it is not one mass thinking unanimously. These are individuals with individual thoughts and ideas coming together to try and work as one in the best way that they can. There is a lot of forgiving and understanding that goes on.  Innocence  Throughout the novel Camilla starts out as this naive sheltered child, but as the story progresses, she moves from her innocent state as she experiences and discovers the world around her. Part of growing up is moving away from the protection and sheltered-ness that comes with innocence. Yet, her move from innocence doesn't feel unnatural or bad, it is merely part of growing up and becoming an adult. It is normal for a teenager to begin to look at the world and see new things and ask different questions, it is normal to begin seeking new experiences and gaining new understandings of past experiences. That move out of innocence is normal and while it may seem to have disappeared all at once, does draw away gradually until suddenly it seems, it is no longer there.  Individuality and Identity  Individualism is another major element of this story. Camilla is seeking to find herself as she experiences a loss of innocence and begins to really explore the world around her. She is impressed by many different opinions and ideas, she is pulled in different directions by her parents. At the beginning of the novel there is a great feeling of overwhelmed that comes from Camilla, but as the story progresses and she begins of find what she is really interested in and believes in, her footing becomes more solid. But this individualism isn't just seen with Camilla, it is why all the characters struggle the way that they do. Rose Dickinson is feeling the loss of her beauty with age, and it scares her because that is such a large part of her identity and foundation of who she is, what is she without it? Rafferty is strong and stiff, it is not part of him to show the same affection that Rose wants. Part of coming into individuality is learning to work with others in their individualism. As the end of the story comes, the reader sees this more blatantly. Main characters * Camilla Dickinson ‚Äì The fifteen-year-old narrator; an aspiring astronomer and the only child of wealthy but troubled parents. * Rose Dickinson ‚Äì Camilla's mother, who is having an affair. She is very beautiful but weak, foolish and needy. * Rafferty Dickinson ‚Äì Camilla's father. He is an architect, serious and cold. However, he is also weak in that he is unable to leave Rose, no matter what she does. * Luisa Rowan ‚Äì Camilla's best friend, from a less affluent bohemian family. Luisa is strong-willed and very possessive, especially when is comes to Camilla. Her parents are also having serious marital issues. * Frank Rowan ‚Äì Luisa's older brother who has recently returned from boarding school. He is very philosophical and passionate but is also troubled by his own problems. * Mona Rowan ‚Äì Luisa and Frank's mother, she spends her weekends entirely drunk. She is accused of feeling to much. * Bill Rowan ‚Äì Luisa and Frank's father, very little is seen of him. His fights with Mona are a prevalent part of the story and help move the story along. He is accused of lacking feeling which plays into the idea that is discussed throughout the novel about being alive and living. * David Gauss ‚Äì A kind and thoughtful young war veteran who is Frank's friend. He lost both of his legs in World War II and lives with his mother in Greenwich Village. He plays a role in helping to further Camilla's different views on the world. * Jacques ‚Äì Rose's lover. He is both intelligent and manipulative; Camilla never trusts or likes him. She seems to have put all the blame of her parents' rough relationship onto him. * Pompilia Riccoli ‚Äì Frank's ex-girlfriend. Camilla is not very happy when her name is brought up. * The Stephanowskis ‚Äì They are the only parental couple in the novel that are intact and continuing to get along; they give hope for a better future and the prospect of love that lasts, and staying alive even when hard and troubling things happen. Film adaptation An adaptation of the novel was made into a film written and directed by Cornelia Moore, featuring Adelaide Clemens as Camilla Dickinson, Gregg Sulkin as Frank Rowan, Cary Elwes as Rafferty and Samantha Mathis as Rose. The project began filming in Spokane, Washington in mid-November 2010. The film premiered on May 20, 2012 at Seattle International Film Festival. Sequel In 1996, L'Engle published a sequel to Camilla Dickinson entitled A Live Coal in the Sea, in which Camilla, now a grandmother and a renowned astronomer, tells the story of her life to her granddaughter. The Dickinson parents and the Rowans also appear in the sequel.

It is characterized by two primary areas of activity. The first set of activities was based around the British base of operations in New York City, where each side made probes and counterprobes against the other's positions that sometimes resulted in notable actions. The second was essentially a frontier war in Upstate New York and rural northern Pennsylvania that was largely fought by state militia companies and some Indian allies on the American side, and Loyalist companies supported by Indians, British Indian agents, and occasionally British regulars. The notable exception to significant Continental Army participation on the frontier was the 1779 Sullivan Expedition, in which General John Sullivan led an army expedition that drove the Iroquois out of New York. The warfare amongst the splinters of the Iroquois Six Nations were particularly brutal, turning much of the Indian population into refugees. The only other notable actions occurred in New England. A combined American-French attempt was made to drive the British out of Newport, Rhode Island. The Battle of Rhode Island ended badly when the French fleet abandoned the effort; the failure did some damage to American‚ÄìFrench relations. In 1779 the British established a base on the Penobscot River in the District of Maine with the intent of establishing a Loyalist presence there. The state of Massachusetts responded with the amphibious Penobscot Expedition, which ended in complete disaster. The British continued a process of raiding the New England coastal communities. One such raid led to a skirmish at Freetown, Massachusetts, while others descended on Massachusetts and Connecticut coastal communities. In the 1781 Battle of Groton Heights, the British were led by Connecticut native Benedict Arnold, who did substantial damage to the town. British strategy after Saratoga After General John Burgoyne surrendered his army after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 France entered the war, recognizing the United States and entering into a military alliance. France dispatched a fleet and army across the Atlantic to aid the Americans fighting for independence, in addition to pursuing military operations in the Caribbean and the East Indies. France also applied pressure on Spain to enter the war; although this did not happen until 1779, Spanish actions in other theaters further stretched British military resources. These strategic changes forced the British to shift their attention away from North America, moving troops, ships and resources to defend the West Indies, India and other colonial possessions, as well as guarding against the threat of a French invasion of Great Britain itself. In North America, the British withdrew from Philadelphia in 1778, and made New York City the headquarters for the North American theater of war. They then embarked on a southern strategy, in which they sought to gain control over the colonies of Georgia, North and South Carolina, and Virginia, where they believed Loyalist sentiment to be strong. This activity formed the bulk of military activity in North America for the remainder of the war, but actions and forays occurred from British strongholds in Quebec, New York, Rhode Island, and Nova Scotia. Following their consolidation after the Saratoga disaster, the British began recruiting American Loyalists and Native allies in great numbers to make up for their lack of army troops, and dispatched them on what were essentially raiding expeditions against Patriot settlements on the frontiers. Using their naval supremacy the British also launched raids and amphibious actions against the New England coastline. American strategy after Saratoga American military strategy widened to some extent following entry of France into the war. The states were still dominated by the larger British army, which kept the Continental Army on the defensive outside Philadelphia and New York. The British began withdrawing from Philadelphia early in 1778, and the arrival of a French fleet off Philadelphia in July increased prospects for offensive action. While these large-scale actions occupied the army, militia and settlers on the northern and west frontiers of New York and Pennsylvania had to contend with incursions by Indians and Loyalists organized by the British out of posts in Quebec. Skirmishes around New York Each side made probes or diversionary movements designed to keep the other side on edge and uncertain of its intentions. General Clinton sent troops to \\"clean out that nest of Rebel Pirates\\" at Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey. In the Battle of Chestnut Neck on October 6, 1778 the British destroyed some American supplies, and on the 15th surprised Pulaski's Legion in the Little Egg Harbor massacre. Apparently as a diversion to draw attention away from that raid, Clinton also sent troops into northern New Jersey. During those movements, 12 companies of British light infantry led by Charles Grey surprised and slaughtered a sleeping company of American dragoons in the Baylor Massacre on September 27. In May 1779 Clinton captured the outpost at Stony Point, New York, which guarded one side of a major crossing point on the Hudson River. When he weakened this force to provide troops for William Tryon's coastal raids, Washington devised an attack to regain the position. In the Battle of Stony Point on July 16, the fort was stormed and captured by Anthony Wayne's light infantry. Clinton later withdrew his forces back to New York as part of the planning for the invasion of the southern states. Later in 1779, Light Horse Harry Lee led American troops in a surprise raid on Paulus Hook in present-day Jersey City, New Jersey that weakened British control of northern New Jersey. In early 1780, a British attack against an American outpost in Westchester County, New York resulted in about 50 American casualties and 75 captured in the Battle of Young's House. The last notable action in the New York area was an attempt by the British to regain control of northern New Jersey in June by attacking the main Continental Army camp at Morristown. The first British- Hessian thrust by Wilhelm von Knyphausen was blocked at the Battle of Connecticut Farms on June 7. A second offensive by Knyphausen on June 23 was halted in the Battle of Springfield after stiff fighting when Nathanael Greene appeared on the scene with 2,000 troops. This put an end to British ambitions in New Jersey. On 21 July, Wayne with two Pennsylvania brigades and four cannons attacked a loyalist blockhouse at Bulls Ferry, New Jersey. In the Battle of Bull's Ferry, the 70 Tories endured an artillery barrage and repelled all American attacks, inflicting 15 killed and 49 wounded while suffering only 21 casualties. Coastal actions The northern coast did not see a great deal of military action after 1777, although the British executed a series of raids against the coastal communities of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and there was occasional skirmishing. The arrival off New York of a French fleet in July 1778 caused a flurry of activity. Major General John Sullivan had earlier been sent to Rhode Island to organize an attack on British-occupied Newport. The British raided his supply caches, as well as destroying military defenses and significantly damaging several communities on Mount Hope Bay. Sullivan's efforts became part of the first major attempt at Franco-American cooperation after the idea of an attack on New York was rejected. Marred by bad weather and poor communication, French troops arrived but were not used, and the Americans, while in retreat after a brief failed siege effort at Newport, fought an inconclusive battle with British forces in the Battle of Rhode Island. General Clinton marshalled troops from New York intending to support the New York garrison, but he arrived off Newport after the Americans had been driven off. Clinton instead ordered these troops on a raid (also led by General Grey) against New Bedford, Massachusetts and Martha's Vineyard in September. He also ordered a series of raids on the Connecticut coast led by William Tryon in 1779. The most devastating raid was against New London in 1781, led by turncoat British General Benedict Arnold. In the summer of 1778 British military planners in London began to develop plans for a new Loyalist settlement in Penobscot Bay. An expedition was organized in early 1779, and on May 30, a fleet carrying troops and supplies left Halifax, Nova Scotia. Arriving about two weeks later, the British established a series of fortifications on the east side of the bay. The State of Massachusetts organized an expedition to drive the British out with minimal support from the Continental Congress. This expedition ended in disaster, with the entire fleet destroyed and nearly half the expedition's men killed, captured, or wounded. It was the worst defeat of an American naval force until the 20th century. Failure of the expedition was attributed to a lack of well- defined command between the land and naval components, and Commodore Dudley Saltonstall's unwillingness to engage the British fleet that arrived in relief. Frontier war =Expanded Native American role= In the aftermath of the Saratoga campaign, a frontier war emerged. Before Burgoyne's campaign, Quebec's Governor Guy Carleton had previously restricted their use in Quebec territory (which at that time encompassed the Iroquois lands that are now western New York, Ohio, and northwestern Pennsylvania). Carleton was, however, ordered by Secretary of State Lord Sackville (who harbored an intense political and personal hatred for Carleton, and had denied him the command given to Burgoyne) to expand recruitment. This Carleton did, encouraging and funding John Butler at Fort Niagara for the purpose. Some of these recruits joined Burgoyne, while others joined Barry St. Leger on his equally unsuccessful Siege of Fort Stanwix in August 1777. The bloody Battle of Oriskany, fought mainly between Native Americans on the British side and Tryon County militia accompanied by some Oneidas, exposed fractures within the Iroquois Confederacy and marked the start of a bloody intra-Iroquois civil war. Although there were still tribal interests that wanted to remain neutral, vocal advocates of war, including the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, and the continued persuasion of John Butler (which included many presents and the use of liquor to weakening Native resolve), convinced many of the Iroquois, particularly the Senecas and Cayugas to take up arms for the British. These forces were principally led by war chiefs leaders Cornplanter and Sayenqueraghta, although Brant led a contingent of Mohawks and a small force of Loyalists known as Brant's Volunteers. Brant's recruitment of Loyalists sometimes put him at odds with the Butlers, who were also recruiting Loyalists for their ranger companies. =Raiding in the valleys, 1778= These forces engaged in destructive raids on outlying settlements of New York and Pennsylvania in the Mohawk, Susquehanna, Delaware, and upper Hudson River valleys, known as the Burning of the Valleys. These raids aimied to destroy farms and crops and disrupt the flow of supplies to the American forces. These operations were primarily under the leadership of John Butler, his son Walter, or under the direction of one of the war chiefs. They were supplied by the British in Quebec and sympathetic Loyalist and Indian communities. These raids sometimes crossed into the territory of present-day Vermont, territory that was formally claimed by New York but had recently proclaimed independence from New York after many years of dispute. The frontier settlers organized militia to defend themselves, and were supported by a few Continental Army Regiments based at Fort Schuyler, Cherry Valley, and the Wyoming Valley (now part of Pennsylvania but then disputed between that state and Connecticut). These defenses were largely ineffective at preventing the raiders from acting, but communities were sometimes warned of impending attacks by friendly Oneidas, most of whom sided with the Americans. In 1778, Brant recruited a mixed force of Loyalists and Iroquois, and started his frontier raids with an attack on Cobleskill, New York in May 1778, and the Senecas operated in the Susquehanna River valley, driving settlers out of present-day Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in a series of actions that became known as the Big Runaway. The Butlers and Senecas joined forces in early July to attack the Wyoming Valley. Although Brant was not present, atrocities claimed to have been committed there contributed to his reputation as a \\"monster\\", and the Seneca were outraged at false accusations that they had committed atrocities. Brant joined forces with some of Butler's Rangers to attack German Flatts in early September. New York authorities responded to Brant's activities by destroying the Indian towns of Unadilla and Onaquaga in October; those towns had been used by Brant and the Butlers as bases of operation. Brant, the Butlers and some Senecas joined forces to take revenge by participating in a major attack on Cherry Valley in early November in which as many as 30 non-combatants were slaughtered in the aftermath. British forces from the Montreal area led by Major Christopher Carleton raided communities in the upper Hudson River valley in October. =Sullivan expedition, 1779= The brutal frontier warfare led to calls in the Continental Congress for the army to take an active role. In 1779, Washington sent General John Sullivan on a punitive expedition to suppress Indian attacks. Sullivan and his troops systematically destroyed Iroquois villages, successfully driving the Iroquois north into Quebec. In the only major action in that expedition, Sullivan's forces defeated those of the Butlers and Brant in the Battle of Newtown. Brant led raids that specifically targeted the villages of the Oneida and the Tuscarora, who also supported the American cause. This destruction of Indian villages on both sides effectively depopulated much of the Iroquois territory as the survivors of the raids became refugees, but Sullivan's expedition failed in its objective of stopping or reducing the frequency of frontier attacks. In April, a few months prior to the Sullivan Expedition, American Colonel Van Schaick led an expedition of over 500 soldiers against the Onondagas, destroying several villages.http://www.nps.gov/fost/historyculture/the-van-schaick-expedition- april-1779.htm =Raiding continues= The Butlers continued to attack New York frontier areas while Brant became more active on the western front. In early April 1782, Anne Hupp defended the fort of Miller's Blockhouse against a Shawnee Indian attack, for over 24 hours in 1782 while eight months pregnant, after her husband was murdered and scalped. Even after preliminary peace was agreed in 1782, Brant tried to continue the war, but was forced to abandon the effort when the British stopped supplying him.

Since the 1980s, the area surrounding the inner-Sydney suburb of Newtown, New South Wales (NSW), Australia‚Äîincluding the suburbs of Newtown, Enmore, Erskineville, Camperdown and St Peters‚Äîhas been known for its wide range of prominent graffiti and street art on walls. The public visual art in the Newtown area consists of a variety of styles and methods of execution, including large-scale painted murals, hand-painted (or sprayed) political slogans, hand-painted figurative designs, spray painted semi- abstract designs (including large-scale and elaborate semi-pictorial) \\"tags\\"), and other stylistic developments such as stencil art and street poster art (also known as \\"wheatpasting\\"), \\"Yarn bombing\\", and sculptural items cast from plaster and other materials. Locations Street art locations in the greater Newtown area include: * Murals facing onto King St and adjoining streets. * Stencil art around the photographic studio in Gladstone Street, near Newtown Railway Station. * Stencils, slogans and murals in and around the pedestrian tunnel under the railway line, linking Bella St and Bedford St. * Graffiti works in the area between Enmore Rd and the railway line, including Gladstone St, the Wilford St industrial area, Wilford Lane, Phillip Lane and Thurnby Lane. * Murals, stencils and graffiti slogans in and around Camperdown Memorial Rest Park. * Wall art in the vicinity of St Peters Station and Applebee St, near Sydney Park. * The multi-panel spraypaint mural on the rear wall of St Luke's Church, Enmore by Matthew Peet (aka \\"Mistery\\"). Another example is two slogans painted on the wall of a house on Salisbury Rd in Camperdown, at the Kingston Rd intersection. A large hand-painted slogan that displayed, \\"Madonna: The Devil Incarnate\\", was accompanied by a smaller slogan that read, \\"iConsume\\". Both slogans lasted approximately two weeks before being painted over. Artists and attribution Although several major works are community or private commissions, or were carried out with permission, others are illegal. Artworks are therefore rarely attributed to their respective artists due to the need for anonymity. Another impediment to attribution is the abstract nature of the pieces and identifying \\"tags\\" of the creators. =Unmitigated Audacity Productions= Andrew Aiken: Mona Mural Erskinville Rd, Newtown, c1990. Many of the biggest and best-known large-scale murals painted in Newtown in the early 1990s were created by a group of mural artists called \\"Unmitigated Audacity Productions (UAP)\\". This group included Sydney mural artists, Matthew Peet (aka \\"Mistery\\" and member of hip-hop group, Brethren), Juilee Pryor, and New Zealand-born artist, Andrew Aiken. Among the past and present murals that can be attributed to UAP are: * The \\"Martin Luther King\\" mural on King St, painted by Andrew Aiken and Juilee Pryor (with Tony Spanos), now heritage listed. * The \\"Mona\\" mural by Andrew Aiken, on Erskineville Rd opposite Newtown Post Office; as of 2011, still in existence, but now in a poor state of preservation. * The \\"South of the Border\\" mural on King St South, near the Union Hotel. * The Newtown Police Citizens Youth Club (PCYC) murals, by Matthew Peet and Andrew Aiken; the PCYC was demolished in 2015 and a new apartment complex is currently under construction. * The now- erased Miles Davis/John Coltrane mural on Erskineville Rd (\\"On The Wings of a Song\\"), painted by Aiken and Peet. * The now-erased \\"Per Ardua ad Astra\\" mural, painted on the wall of the house opposite the \\"On The Wings of a Song\\" mural; the piece is clearly visible from Newtown Railway station. * The \\"Pieta\\" mural, by Andrew Aiken, painted on the side of a (currently abandoned) house on Erskineville Road, opposite the BP service station. * The now-erased \\"Idiot Box\\" mural at 64 Erskineville Rd, opposite the Imperial Hotel was created by Andrew Aiken. * The large multi-panel mural on the rear wall of St Luke's Church in Stanmore Rd, Enmore, was painted by a team led by Matthew Peet As of early 2016 this has largely been defaced or erased and only a few sections remain. * \\"Deja Vu 1\\" (1992), was painted on a wall on the corner of Erskineville Rd and Linthorpe St. According to Pryor, it was painted by Aiken \\" ... in an explosion of rage about the war in Bosnia. The theme is remembrance and the futility of war. On the base of the wall can be seen the words 'Have we already forgotten?'\\". This mural is no longer extant and the building on which it was painted was subsequently demolished and replaced by an apartment complex. Juilee Pryor photographed much of the group's mural work and she has donated digital copies of these photos to the City of Sydney's photographic archive on the ArchivePix website =Andrew Aiken= Andrew Aiken was the principal artist and major collaborator on several of the most prominent murals in the Newtown area in the early 1990s. His life was detailed in a 2003 Sydney Morning Herald article by Sean Nicholls. Using a donated cherry picker and a thousand dollars worth of paint, Aiken and Pryor created the \\"I Have a Dream\\" mural on King St. over two nights in August 1991, describing it as a \\"humanist protest against the sterility of postmodern art\\". Twelve months earlier, Aiken had fled the UK after murdering a man he had lived with in a London squat and burying the body of the 40-year-old busker in the squat's cellar. In 1997, after converting to Christianity, Aiken was convinced to give himself up by the leader of the religious group he had joined, the Twelve Tribes community in Picton, New South Wales. He returned to England, where he was tried and convicted of murder. He served 8 years in prison and, on his release in 2005, joined another Twelve Tribes community in Chilliwack, British Columbia. =Big City Freaks= The \\"Big City Freaks\\" street art collective, founded in 1998, includes the artists DMOTE, PUDL, SNARL, SKULL McMURPHY (Troy Edwards), SET and ZEN (aka SKOTE STYLES). The group has executed several large-format murals and other works in the distinctive \\"blended\\" style, combining highly stylized tags and striking graphic elements such as monsters, aliens, robots, skulls and designs sourced from Japanese art. Probably the most popular and currently the longest- surviving example of their collective work is the \\"Great Wave\\" mural. The group has its own website, where images of many of the group's works can be seen. One of BCF's most recent works is a large-format mural, created in late October 2009 on the rear wall of the Ausscrap Building, facing Wilford St, Enmore. The mural is featured on the CD back cover photograph of the album, Size of the Ocean, by Sydney, Australia band, Big Heavy Stuff. =Other artists= * the murals on the Abbey on King backpacker hostel, and the portraits of George Harrison and Jimi Hendrix on the Bella St house are by Jason Moses Preservation Several of the largest and most prominent Newtown area murals, dating from the early 1990s, are no longer extant. The Council of the City of Sydney administers much of the north Newtown area. In Paragraph 8 of its Aerosol Art and Graffiti Policy the Council ostensibly recognizes that these existing large murals are public-domain works worthy of conservation and maintenance, although in practice it has done nothing to prevent murals such as \\"Idiot Box\\" from being removed. Moreover, a Council media spokesperson recently stated that its general approach is \\"... to remove graffiti quickly and consistently to help maintain the appearance of our city while discouraging repeat incidents\\". Because many larger painted murals and other works have been installed covertly and without permission as \\"guerilla\\" art works, individual property owners have often stripped and/or painted over a number of the area's most prominent works of street art in recent years. Many others have been obscured by adjacent construction or destroyed by the demolition of the buildings on which they are painted, as in the case of the wall along Wilford Lane, Enmore, which formed the rear part of the former Blockbuster video store site, which was redeveloped into a large apartment complex. The extensive martial arts-themed murals along the rear of the former Murray's Martial Arts centre on Kingston Rd were destroyed when the old building was demolished in 2016 for a new apartment development but the developers have commissioned new custom wall art for the site, which is already in place. Many other works are gradually covered over with more recent work by other graffiti artists after a period of weeks or months. In recent years the former Marrickville Council (subsequently force-amalgamated into the Inner West Council) introduced a new policy on street art by establishing the \\"Perfect Match\\" program, in which the Council brought together local property owners and street artists, who were commissioned to create custom art works for fences and walls. These works are officially sanctioned by the Council and are signposted with a special plaque that includes information on the artwork and the artist. Murals and wall art of the Newtown area =King Street north and environs= Africa Mural off King St, Newtown, c2000. The first mural that visitors will encounter when traveling south along King St. from the city is the \\"Herald\\" mural in northern King St. This large mural is an enlarged reproduction of the above the fold of the front page of the Friday 10 July 1992 edition of the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, as can be clearly seen in the accompanying image. The image below the SMH says 'No Time'. At the bottom right hand corner used to be the words 'like the present'. This little section was removed during the creation of a driveway for the business that set up next door (around the mid-2000s). The \\"I Have a Dream\\" (Martin Luther King) mural, painted over two nights in August 1991, is the largest, most prominent, and the longest-surviving of the many large format murals created around Newtown by the team known as Unmitigated Audacity Productions, the core members of which were New Zealand-born Canadian artist Andrew Aiken and his colleague Juilee Pryor. They were assisted in this mural by Tony Spanos, who provided a cherry-picker to allow the upper part of the mural to be painted. It commemorates American civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King Jr.. One of the last surviving large-format murals in the area, it displays a large portrait of Dr King, next to a large painted depiction of the Apollo 8 photograph of the Earth from space, and Dr King's quote \\"I have a dream\\" in large Gothic lettering, near which is the quotation from Genesis 37:19: \\"Behold the dreamer cometh; Come now therefore and let us slay him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams\\". The upper section of the design remains largely unchanged from its original concept. A portion of left-hand- side of the mural was damaged by a 2011 fire that destroyed a temporary ticket booth set up nearby, but it was restored soon after. The lower part of the mural has gone through numerous changes since it was first painted. At the time the mural was created, there was a raised garden bed against the wall of the building and the shrubs planted there partially obscured the bottom section, which initially featured a painted collage of a group of people. The council cleared the vegetation soon after and the lower part of the mural soon began to be defaced, notably with racist graffiti, which Aiken and Pryor quickly painted over, sometimes with anti-racist slogans. Frustrated by criticism of the mural by Marrickville Council's Community Arts Officer of the time, Aiken then over-painted the figures with a quotation from the officer (\\"Murals are no longer a valid art form\\") in large white Gothic lettering. He subsequently repainted the entire bottom section with a Newtown \\"Declaration of Independence\\" that featured a large blank space and the invitation \\"Sign here\\". At some point after this was painted, the council removed the garden bed and the declaration was in turn replaced with the design that is still in place, a large representation of the Aboriginal flag. The Last Supper Mural on King St. is located opposite the intersection of Church St. Despite broad community acceptance of the mural and the general respect shown to it, the mural has recently been defaced by vandal taggers who climbed onto the roof of the building it is painted on (and many others in the vicinity) and who spray- painted tags on the top edge of the mural and many other buildings in the vicinity. The \\"Africa\\" mural in King St. was originally painted in the early 1990s. The large work occupies the entire side wall of an African restaurant, located between the Newtown Mission and the Commonwealth Bank. The first version was reproduced from an old map printed by the Australian firm Chas. Scally & Co., most likely dating from the 1960s. The current version, painted over the original in the early 2000s, reflects the major changes in African political geography in the recent times. The \\"Eagle\\" mural is located in Wilson St., Newtown, on the rear wall of the Newtown Mission. The graphic style and content are very similar to the \\"Martin Luther King\\" mural and it is presumed to have been created by Andrew Aiken sometime in the early to mid-1990s. The lengthy Biblical quotation on the left-hand side of the mural is from the Book of Isaiah 40:28-31. =King Street south= There are many prominent murals and \\"wall art\\" works to be found along the southern end of King St., between Newtown Station and St. Peter's Station/Sydney Park. Only a few of these face directly onto King St., and most are located along the side walls of buildings on the corners of King St and the various side streets that lead off from it. The \\"South of the Border\\" mural (created by Unmitigated Audacity Productions) is located on the side wall of a shop on King St., opposing the Union Hotel. This mural was clearly visible for many years, but is now obscured by a tree growing in the front yard of the terrace house next door. =Enmore Road= The major mural along Enmore Road is the \\"Jungle\\" mural painted on the side of the medical practice on the corner of Bailey St. and Enmore Rd., next to the Caltex petrol station. Created by retired artist, Colin Bebe, it depicts various African wild animals rampaging around the intersection of King St. and Enmore Rd. =The \\"Great Wave\\" mural= BCF: Great Wave Mural Munni/Gowrie St, Newtown, 2000. One of the largest and longest-lasting Newtown murals is the \\"Great Wave\\" mural, painted on the side of a house located at the corner of Munni St. and Gowrie St. in south Newtown. Created in 2000, it features a striking combination of elaborate 3D style abstract pieces and pictorial images on a Japanese theme, including a huge image of a breaking wave rendered in the style of the famous Hokusai woodcut The Great Wave Off Kanagawa. The work is credited to artists \\"DAYS\\", \\"DMOTE\\", \\"PUDL\\" and \\"SNARL\\", members of the street art collective \\"Big City Freaks\\" (BCF), whose initials can be seen on the far right of the Great Wave mural. In October 2009 members of this group rendered a new mural along the rear wall of the Ausscrap building, facing Wilford St. =Trafalgar St= The two story terrace located at the corner of Trafalgar St and Liberty St in Newtown was another prominent Newtown street art site. The work was commissioned over time during the mid to late nineties to give street artists a prominent wall for their work and to brighten an otherwise grey point in the urban landscape. The street-side walls of this house were adorned with a number of images including 1970s cartoon character \\"Fat Albert\\" (painted on the side fence), a large flowing design incorporating a mermaid (depicting the owners love of swimming), and a group of aliens. The Fat Albert was done by Rory (Rors/Akira?) and the aliens by Phiber/Phibs, both prominent artists of the area. The portraits of George Harrison and Jimi Hendrix on the Liberty St. frontage were by graphic artist Jason Moses, who has collaborated with Matthew Peet and who also painted the travel-themed murals on the walls of the Abbey on King backpacker hostel in King St. This property was sold in early 2008 and underwent extensive renovation during 2010, resulting in the eventual destruction of all the murals painted there prior to 2010. In late 2013 two new mural works, one depicting Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen, and the other of singer Freddie Mercury were painted onto the Trafalgar St side of the building (facing the railway). =Other large murals= The \\"Three Proud People\\" mural faces the railway adjacent to the Macdonaldtown railway station. Created ca. 2000, the mural is a reproduction of the famous photo taken at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, when African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos sparked controversy by wearing black gloves and giving the \\"Black Power\\" salute during their medal award ceremony. The third person in the image was Australian athlete Peter Norman, who died in 2006. This mural became the subject of significant Australian media coverage at the time of Norman's death. For many years, the mural was a landmark for thousands of commuters who passed it daily on Sydney's western rail line. In 2007, RailCorp erected high concrete noise barriers near MacDonaldtown Station, which obscured the mural from train travellers. In 2008, Melbourne filmmaker Matt Norman led a campaign to attempt to force RailCorp to install transparent noise barriers to allow the mural to be seen by commuters. The \\"Sydney '04\\" mural is located on the corner of Eve and Coulson St, Erskineville. It was painted in 2004 with the permission of the owner by a team of artists‚ÄîAustralian graffiti artist Dallas (who also created a controversial commissioned mural in Surry Hills ) and two others. Their tags, obscured by the car in the photo, are \\"Days Aus\\", \\"Drift NL\\" (from the Netherlands) and \\"Webs NZ\\". The owner added the red 'No War' slogan in 2007 as a protest against the war in Iraq and a kind of tribute to Saunders and Burgess, the peace activists who painted a \\"No War\\" slogan the Opera House in 2003. =Enmore laneways= Free Speech Mural Witford St, Enmore. One of the most popular areas for graffiti and wall art is the industrial area near the Silo Apartments, bounded by Station St, Enmore Rd, Phillip St and the railway. Many striking graffiti works can be seen on the various factory and warehouse walls along Gladstone St, Wilford St, Wilford Lane, Thurnby Lane and Phillip Lane. Some murals in this area have remained intact for several years while others typically last for only short periods before being tagged or overpainted. Some of the most stylistically distinctive graffiti art works to appear in the Newtown area in recent times are the striking creations by the artist who signs his work \\"EM√ñS\\". These highly intricate, semi-abstract bio-mechanical designs, executed by hand with spray paint, are all sited along Phillip Lane, behind Enmore Rd; some are still visible in June 2007, although inevitably they are being progressively covered by the work of other graffiti artists, and the two examples, shown above second from left and centre, haves now been painted over. However, a number of similarly styled works by other artists, shown below, have appeared along Phillip Lane in recent weeks. A piece of graffiti on or near Bedford Street (next to the railway line), which says \\"Cut me a line / of poetry, man.\\" has been attributed to well-known local poet Benito Di Fonzo. People have claimed that he scribbled the piece to impress his then- girlfriend, local artist Joanne Patricia Shand (aka. Jo Jo Rona). The line is featured in Di Fonzo's poem, \\"Cut Me A Line of Poetry\\". Another dedication to Patricia Shand exists in Erskineville that shows her with two dogs in a wall mural; however, the painter is unknown. =Camperdown Memorial Rest Park= One of the key locations for political and personal graffiti in the Newtown area is the long sandstone wall surrounding St Stephen's Church in Newtown. By the 1940s the cemetery was overgrown. In 1946 local girl Joan Norma Ginn was murdered and her body dumped in the cemetery, where it remained for several days before being found. This prompted action by the local council, which resulted in all but four acres being cleared and resumed as public space. An Act of Parliament in 1948 established the Camperdown Memorial Rest Park, under control of the local council. As a result, most of the gravestones were taken up and placed around the inside of the sandstone wall, although the graves were not disturbed and the depressions that mark their locations are still discernible. Much of the graffiti on the wall around the church is brush- painted or spray-painted, and many are politically oriented slogans, although some stencil graffiti has appeared in recent times, and a number of striking large-scale mural works have been painted on walls and fences surrounding the park. Although most of the graffiti is relatively recent, some examples have survived for many years. One venerable piece of brush-painted graffiti (above, second from left), which can be reliably dated to the mid-1970s and which is still partially visible, is the political slogan, \\"Is Frazer (sic) controlling your bowels?\\"‚Äîa reference to controversial 1970s Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. A photograph of this slogan appeared in a 1976 book on Australian graffiti by photographer Rennie Ellis. Other long-lasting pieces of handpainted graffiti on this wall, believed to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, include the slogans \\"Patriarchy creates destruction\\" and \\"Hands held violently on to words that meant nothing\\" (above, far left). Another slogan remembered by some residents, was: \\"broken-hearted disillusioned desperates against meanness and nastiness, greed and stupidity.\\" Another significant location in Camperdown Park is the various rear walls and back fences of the buildings at the southern edge of the park that face onto Australia Street. A large continuous mural (above, centre) featuring many pictoral designs and elaborate tags, has been painted along the side wall of the large commercial building that faces the Courthouse Hotel, and most of the other fences and walls in this area of the park now have murals or decorative tags, although these have changed a number of times in recent years. The two examples above illustrate this‚Äîthe mural second from right (photographed in March 2007) had been entirely painted over by July 2007 and replaced by the mural shown above, far right. Stencil graffiti In the last few years there has been a rapid proliferation of stencil graffiti around Newtown, with dozens of designs appearing on walls in the area during 2005-2006. This development reflects the growing popularity of this style in many international cities, and particularly in Melbourne, Victoria. For about a decade years (ca. 2006-2016) the most notable location for stencil art in the Newtown area was the outer wall of the triangular property on the corner of Gladstone St and Phillip St in Enmore. The owners allowed graffiti to be applied as long as it was stencil art and from 2006 onwards dozens of stencil designs of all shapes and sizes were applied, and the collection grew. Artists on this wall included \\"KRAM\\", \\"Dam!\\", and \\"GlitaGirl\\". Ca. 2010 a plaster cast of a television and VCR (with the word \\"obsolescence\\" embossed on the screen) was installed on the footpath in front of the wall. The first version was vandalized and was soon replaced. In 2011, the stencil wall was completely over-painted with a large greyscale mural depicting the main foyer of the Natural History Museum in London. This mural, and the adjacent \\"Australiens\\" mural in Gladstone St, which survived for several years, were both subsequently overpainted. The future of this section of Newtown/Enmore as a venue for street art has been affected by the 2016 demolition of the building that originally stood here to make way for an apartment complex. Poster or 'Paste Up'/'Wheatpaste' graffiti Since the mid-2000s innumerable examples of this new form of graphic street art have appeared in the Newtown area. Many small poster and sticker type graffiti graphics have been placed in various locations over the last few years, but these larger works ‚Äî similar in scope to the many large poster graffiti works that have appeared in Melbourne in recent years ‚Äî are a relatively recent development in Newtown. Unlike the conventional painted designs and the recent popularity for stencil graffiti, these new works are essentially a form of poster art. Smaller designs are typically monochrome photocopies (some of which may be hand coloured) while others have been printed as self-adhesive stickers which are often affixed to roadside traffic signs. Several large-format examples have appeared in 2007 such as the 'cartoon' figures pictured below, and the bus design, which was approximately a metre in length. Some, such as the octopus design from Gladstone St, appear to have been hand-painted or screen printed onto the backs of commercially printed street posters. Perfect Match Program In 2011 Marrickville Council and its successor the Inner West Council initiated the Perfect Match program to turn graffiti into Street Art . The inner city council initiative invited local property owners to find their Perfect Match by registering interest to have graffitied walls transformed by renowned street artists. Image:Newtown area graffiti and street art 13.jpg'SMC3', St Peters 2016 Other media Several novel street art developments have recently appeared in the Newtown area. * Yarn bombing involves the creation of pieces of multi-coloured knitted fabrics, which are wrapped around objects such as trees and poles and stitched into place to create a colourful \\"sleeve\\". Around Newtown, this medium has typically taken the form of multi-coloured knitted piece which are stitched around the steel support poles of local road signs. * The concrete graffiti style uses objects cast in concrete or a similar material, which are often glued into place on a footpath or against a wall. Around Newtown, many of these objects appear to have been created by the same artist, Will Coles, as a commentary on consumer culture. They have often been in the form of familiar items such as televisions and TV remote controls, and feature inscribed single-word slogans such as \\"fear\\" or \\"hate\\". These largest of these objects are the installations on King St. and on the corner of Gladstone St., Enmore; both are full-scale replicas of a medium-size CRT television mounted on top of a replica VCR. The King St. object (now defaced by marker tags) is inscribed with the slogan \\"life is fleeting\\" and the Gladstone St. object with the word \\"obsolescence\\". Other concrete graffiti objects (such as those pictured above in May St., St. Peters) are partial representations of human-like faces, which appear to be based on medieval gargoyles. Works no longer extant Below: four vanished Newtown murals -- \\"Idiot Box\\", Erskineville Rd (photographed November 2006), a Jimi Hendrix portrait in Camperdown Memorial Rest Park (photographed July 2005) and a colourful Mayan- inspired mural (same location and date) and a mural in Goddard Lane (off King St.) photographed in January 2007. A number of the largest works of street art in the Newtown area have been removed or painted over by the 21st century; including several large murals executed by Aiken , Pryor and others in the early to mid-1990s (formerly located along, or near, Erskineville Road). For many years since the 1970s, a strip of land along both sides of Erskineville Road, extending east from King St., was reserved by the NSW Department of Main Roads as part of a plan to build a large arterial road through the area. This scheme was eventually abandoned after the imposition of Green Bans by the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF), which effectively stopped all work on the planned road; although, a number of shops and houses along the street were demolished. This struggle is now commemorated by Green Bans Park, located near the railway on Erskineville Rd. The park is located on land that was formerly occupied by buildings that were demolished to make way for the proposed road. Prominent street art pieces and large murals that are no longer extant include: =Erskineville Road= * Newtown PCYC - the group of mural images, executed by Unmitigated Audacity Productions in June‚ÄìJuly 1995, were painted on the outside of the former Newtown Police Citizens Youth Club building on Erskineville Rd. This is presumed to have been a legal project, and like the \\"Herald\\" mural in King St., these images were evidently created by painting (at night) with the use of projected images. There were numerous panels of pictures and text, including portraits of TV characters Sonny Hammond and Skippy, from the 1960s Australian TV series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, an image of Mr. Spock from Star Trek, a stock image of two laughing European peasant women, and a reproduction of a photograph of 1980s Sydney identity the late Sallie-Anne Huckstepp. These images were still extant until October 2013, although, the building had been unused for a number of years, has been partially damaged by fire and for several years was surrounded by a metal hoarding. The Newtown PCYC was demolished in early November 2013 for the construction of a new apartment complex, resulting in the destruction of all murals. \\"Idiot Box\\" mural, Erskineville Rd (no longer extant) * The popular \\"Idiot Box\\" mural that was created by Unmitigated Audacity Productions. The mural was located on the side wall of a large terrace house at 64 Erskineville Road, opposite the renowned Imperial Hotel. It featured a surrealistic portrait of the television character, Marcia Brady, from The Brady Bunch, brandishing an automatic pistol; the mural was painted as if she was bursting through the shattering glass of a television screen. The TV itself is painted in a trompe l'oeil effect, apparently breaking through the brick wall of the house on which the mural is painted. The power switch and power cord and plug of the TV were applied objects made from plastic. This significant mural, which had been in place since 1993, was removed by the then owners of the property in November/December 2006. * The Felix the Cat and \\"Cat in the Hat\\" murals. The murals were painted on the sides of two houses near the intersection of Erskineville Road and Wilson St. These houses originally faced onto a council carpark that had been opened up by the demolition of the terrace that originally stood there. These murals were obscured by the construction of a large block of apartments on the site in the late 1990s. An image of the \\"Cat In The Hat\\" mural, taken by Ben Apfelbaum in 1990, can be viewed here. * The Miles Davis mural \\"On the Wings of a Song\\" by Andrew Aiken and Matthew Peet. This was painted on the side of a house adjacent to the Mrs. Mollie Swift Reserve on Erskineville Road. It depicted jazz musicians Miles Davis and John Coltrane with a rainbow and music notes flowing out from the bells of their instruments. This mural was erased/painted over in the early 2000s. * A mural dedicated to John Coltrane, similar in style to the \\"Wings\\" mural but much smaller in size, was painted on the wall a now-defunct laundry business located on the corner of King St. and Egan St. This mural (thought to be painted by Unmitigated Audacity Productions) was removed ca. 2002. * A figurative mural in Goddard Lane (off King St near the Newtown High School of the Performing Arts) which features distinctive depictions of a spray-can, a cat and a fish (probably by Phibs); this mural was painted over with a new design in Feb. 2008. Commercialisation In mid-2009, artists associated with Sydney company, \\"Mr Perso & Detch\\", to execute a commissioned \\"guerilla\\" graffiti campaign on behalf of Warner Music to promote the album, 21st Century Breakdown, by American rock band, Green Day. The campaign included large painted images in several locations in Newtown and Surry Hills, and the painting of approximately eighty stencils in skate parks around the Sydney city area. The large images depicted the artwork and title of the album; however, at least two of the Newtown murals were soon defaced as a protest by locals, who sprayed over the slogan \\"CA$h Cow\\". Sydney City Council, which has incorporated policies aimed at discouraging \\"graffiti\\", was reported to be investigating the matter. Protest graffiti continues in 2018 with the defacing of Coca Cola advertising on the railway bridge, Enmore Rd, Newtown. The advert, a commercial stencil transfer, drew attention from locals apposed to mega corporates like Coca-Cola Amatil using Newtown spaces for product advertising. Social media proved a hotbed for discussion on the matter with deep divisions of people posting both support for the defacing and others defending the ad.

The Rhenish Republic () was proclaimed at Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle) in October 1923 during the occupation of the Ruhr by troops from France and Belgium (January 19231925). It comprised three territories, named North, South and Ruhr. Their regional capitals were, respectively, Aachen, Koblenz and Essen.  Background  The Rhenish Republic is best understood as the aspiration of a poorly focused liberation struggle. The name was one applied by the short-lived separatist movement that erupted in the German Rhineland during the politically turbulent years following Germany's defeat in the First World War. The objectives of the many different separatist groups ranged widely, from the foundation of an autonomous republic to some sort of change in the status of the Rhineland within the Weimar Republic. Others advocated full integration of the Rhineland into France. Similar political currents were stirring in the south: June 1919 had seen the proclamation by Eberhard Haa√ü of the \\"Pf√§lzische Republik\\", centred on Speyer in the occupied territory of the Bavarian Palatinate. Rhenish separatism in the 1920s should be seen in the context of resentments fostered by economic hardship and the military occupation to which the previously prosperous region was subjected. After 1919, blame for defeat in the First World War was apportioned to (amongst others) the military or simply the French. France, like Germany, had been profoundly traumatised by the First World War and the conduct of its occupation of the left bank of the Rhine was perceived as unsympathetic, even among its Western wartime allies. Increasingly, however, blame was directed against the German government itself, in far-off Berlin. By 1923, as the German currency collapsed, the French occupation forces headquartered at Mainz (under the command of Generals Mangin and Fayolle) were having some success in their encouragement of anti- Berlin separatism in the occupied zones. After 1924, economic hardship slowly began to ease and a measure of brittle stability returned to Germany under the Weimar State. The appeal of Rhenish separatism, never a mass movement, was damaged by the violence employed by many of its more desperate supporters. The political temperature cooled after the French occupation of the Ruhr attracted increasingly strident criticism from Great Britain and the United States. Following the Dawes Plan in September 1924, an agreement to a slightly less punitive war reparations payment r√©gime, the French vacated the Ruhr in the summer of 1925. The end of the Rhenish Republic can be dated at December 1924, when its leading instigator, Hans Adam Dorten (1880‚Äì1963), was obliged to flee to Nice. By 1930, when French troops also vacated the left bank of the Rhine, the concept of a Rhenish Republic, independent of Berlin, no longer attracted popular support.  Historical context  The Cisrhenian Republic (1797‚Äì1802) and subsequent incorporation of the region into the French Empire lasted for less than a generation, but introduced to the occupied Rhineland many of the features of the modern state. These were revolutionary and widely welcomed. One objective of the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was to undo Napol√©on's territorial changes, so the German Lower Rhine and Westphalia reverted to the Kingdom of Prussia (joined by the Middle Rhine and Cologne), the Palatinate region to Bavaria. Nonetheless, Prussia's western territories continued to adhere to the Napoleonic legal system and, in many other respects, the relationship between the citizen and the state had been permanently transformed. In addition, mutual intolerance of religious differences, stretching back centuries, endured between Protestant Prussia and the predominantly Roman Catholic populations of the Rhineland. The incorporation/reincorporation of most of the Rhineland into Prussia did not run smoothly and remained incomplete more than a century later. Many Rhinelanders continued to regard rule by Prussia as a form of foreign occupation. At the same time, these events occurred during the occupation of the Rhineland by American, Belgian, British and French troops.  Chronology  =Dr Adenauer calls a meeting= On 1 February 1919, more than sixty of the Rhineland's civic leaders together with locally based Prussian National Assembly Members convened in Cologne at the invitation of the city's mayor, Konrad Adenauer of the Catholic Center Party. There was only one item on the agendum: \\"The Creation of the Rhenish Republic\\" (). In addressing delegates, Adenauer identified the wreckage of Prussian hegemonistic power as the inevitable consequence (\\"notwendige Folge\\") of the Prussian system. Prussia was viewed by opponents as \\"Europe's evil spirit\\" and was \\"ruled over by an unscrupulous caste of war-fixated militaristic aristocrats\\" ('). The other German states should, therefore, no longer put up with Prussian supremacy. Prussia must be divided up, and her western provinces separated out to form a West German Republic. This should render impossible future domination of Germany by Prussia's eastern militaristic ethos. Adenauer was, however, keen that his West German Republic should remain inside the German political union. Agreement on blaming Berlin was the easy part: the complexity of the practical issues to be addressed in defining a federalist agenda for an economically destitute territory that politically, linguistically and legally was part of Germany, but most of which was occupied militarily by France, must have been daunting. In the end, the Cologne meeting produced a two-point resolution. The meeting asserted as valid the right of the Rhineland peoples to political self-determination. The proclamation of a West German Republic was to be deferred, however, so that the Prussian state might be divided up. In this way a practical solution could first be agreed with the occupying power and her allies regarding the issue of reparations. During the months following Adenauer's meeting, separatist movements with a range of priorities and agendas appeared in many Rhineland towns and villages. =Hans Adam Dorten and the Wiesbaden Proclamation= Hans Adam Dorten (1880‚Äì1963), an army reserve officer and former D√ºsseldorf public prosecutor, made a speech at Wiesbaden, on 1 June 1919, in which he proclaimed \\"The Independent Rhenish Republic\\", which was to incorporate the existing Rhineland Province along with parts of Hesse and Bavaria's Upper Rhineland. A non-violent putsch was also attempted across the Rhine in Mainz. This, along with other poorly coordinated localised actions inspired by Dorten's Wiesbaden Proclamation, failed to attract significant popular support and soon failed. The Supreme Court in Leipzig issued an arrest warrant for Dorten, citing 'high treason', but by remaining in the French occupied territories, Dorten made the execution of arrest warrant impossible. At liberty, Dorten continued his struggle: on 22 January 1922 he founded in Boppard a political party, the \\"Rhenish Peoples' Union\\" (Rheinische Volksvereinigung), chaired by Bertram Kastert (1868‚Äì1935), a senior Cologne pastor. Thanks to the outstanding treason indictment, Dorten and his circle found themselves shunned by members of the mainstream political parties. The Rhenish Peoples' Union stayed in the shadows, its weekly publication, German Standpoint (Deutsche Warte) and its leaders' other campaigning activities depending on French sponsorship. Dorten moved to France at the end of 1923 and later took French Citizenship. =Occupation of the Ruhr= During 1923, Germany was shaken by adverse international developments and by a dramatic further deterioration in the economic climate: the year was one of crises. The German government fell into arrears with war reparations payments. In response, on 8 March 1921, French and Belgian troops moved in to occupy Duisburg and D√ºsseldorf. On 9 January 1923 the Reparations Commission determined that Germany had willfully held back from making payments due, and two days later troops occupied the rest of the Ruhr Area: thus the Rhineland's richest industrial region now bore, on behalf of Germany, the principal burden of the reparations imposed at Versailles. In the fighting that followed more than a hundred people lost their lives. More than 70,000 were turned out in order to make space for French and Belgian workers. Mostly young men, those suddenly evicted and deprived of their livelihoods frequently found themselves homeless and some ended up joining one or other of the various active Rhenish separatist groups. Respectable Rhinelanders, appalled at their unkempt appearance, were inclined to dismiss the dispossessed as work-shy thieving riff-raff ('). The currency stability that had underpinned several decades of sustained economic growth in much of Europe well into the second decade of the twentieth century was a casualty of the First World War. The statesmen who devised the Versailles settlement were not economists. Their aspirations did not extend to creating the balanced economic environment needed to support future growth: even at the time their approach to the economic aspects of the Versailles Peace settlement drew strident criticism from John Maynard Keynes, an eminent and closely informed commentator. In 1923, the pre-war price stability remained a distant memory for Europeans, but the occupation of the Ruhr coincided with, and in the view of many commentators triggered, a tipping point for the German currency. Prices escalated: the usefulness of money collapsed and hyperinflation took hold; commerce virtually ceased. Writing in the journal Die Weltb√ºhne (The World Stage), from the perspective of August 1929, the distinguished political commentator Kurt Tucholsky offered an assessment: ‚ÄúThere was no appetite in the Rhineland for union with France, but little enthusiasm for continued union with Prussia. All that people wanted, and were entitled to, was an end to the hellish nightmare of hyperinflation and the creation of an autonomous republic with its own currency.\\"  \\"Government\\" in Koblenz: Separatism across the Rhineland  The administrative and occupied zones of western Germany by the end of 1923. Koblenz had been the administrative capital of the Prussian Rhine Province since 1822. Amidst the turmoil of economic collapse, it was here that, on 15 August 1923, the \\"United Rhenish Movement\\" (') was formed from a merging of several existing separatist groups. Leaders included Dorten of the \\"Rhenish Peoples' Union\\" (die Rheinische Volksvereinigung) and a journalist named Josef Friedrich Matthes (1886‚Äì1943) of the \\"Rhenish Independence League\\" (der Rheinischen Unabh√§ngigkeitsbund) which had been founded by Josef Smeets from Cologne. Another leading figure present was Leo Deckers from Aachen. The unambiguous goal of the United Rhenish Movement was the complete separation of the Rhine Province from Prussia, and the establishment of a Rhenish Republic under French protection. The creation of the republic was to be publicly proclaimed: meetings would be convened across the Rhineland. Endorsement from the French, with their military headquarters in Mainz, was taken for granted: it is not clear what thought was given to the possibility that commanders of France's junior partner in the occupation might take a less benign view of separatist activities just across the border from Belgium's Eupen enclave, west of Aachen, only recently incorporated into Belgium under the terms of the Versailles settlement. Two months later, ten kilometres to the east of Aachen, the tricolour flag of the Rhenish Republic appeared outside a house in the small town of Eschweiler. Inside, the movement set up a communications center on 19 October 1923. A week after that, the separatists attempted a putsch against the Rathaus. Surrender was refused however: a truce briefly ensued. The next day, the government urged resistance and eventually, on 2 November 1923, Belgian occupation troops expelled the separatists from Eschweiler. Meanwhile, in Aachen itself, separatists led by Leo Deckers and Dr Guthardt captured the Aachen Rathaus (city hall) where, in the Imperial Chamber, they proclaimed the \\"Free and Independent Rhenish Republic\\" on 21 October 1923. The next day the separatists came up against counter demonstrators who surrounded and wrecked their Sekretariat in Friedrich-Wilhelm-Platz, near the theatre. 23 October opened with shooting in the streets: meanwhile the city fire brigade reclaimed the Rathaus, forcing the separatists to retreat to government buildings. That day Belgian troops imposed martial law. On 25 October, the local police were placed under the command of the Belgian occupation forces after attempting to storm the separatists out of the government buildings, only to find themselves thwarted by occupation troops. Across town, changes at the Technical High School included the exclusion from Aachen of non-resident students. On 2 November, the Rathaus was retaken by the separatists, now reinforced by around 1000 members of the \\"Rhineland protection force\\" (der Rheinland-Schutztruppen). Belgian High Commissar, Baron Rolin-Jaquemyns, responded by ordering an immediate end to the separatist government and called the troops off the streets. The City Council convened in the evening and swore loyalty to the German State ('). Parallel coup attempts in many Rhenish towns blew up, most of them following much the same pattern. Local government representatives and officials were expelled from civic buildings which were taken over. The Rhenish tricolour was raised over occupied town halls. Notices were posted and leaflets distributed informing citizens of the change of r√©gime. However, civic putsches did not prevail everywhere: in J√ºlich, M√∂nchengladbach, Bonn and Erkelenz, separatist attempts to take over public buildings were immediately thwarted, sometimes violently: other districts remained entirely untouched by separatist agitation. To the north, in Duisburg, separarists inaugurated, on 22 October 1923 a mini-state that would endure for five weeks. Local members of the Rhenish Independence League took to the streets, proclaiming, disingenuously, that their new republic had come into being without any input from the French: attempts to suppress the Duisburg republic more rapidly were nonetheless blocked by the French occupation forces. Back in Koblenz, the regional capital, separatists had tried to seize power on 21 October 1923. The next day saw hand-to-hand fighting involving the local police. During the night of 23 October, Koblenz Castle, which had been out of the limelight since 1914 when the Kaiser had briefly established his wartime headquarters there, was captured by separatists with French military support. The occupiers were temporarily evicted by local police the following day, only to renew their occupation that night. On 26 October, the French High Commissioner, Paul Tirard, confirmed that the separatists were in possession of effective power ('). Subject to the self-evident superior authority of the occupiers, he stated that they needed to introduce all the necessary measures (alle notwendigen Ma√ünahmen einleiten). Separatist leaders Dorten and Josef Friedrich Matthes interpreted Tirard's intervention as an effective carte blanche from the occupation forces. A cabinet was formed and Matthes, as its chairman, designated \\"Prime Minister of the Rhenish Republic\\" ('). The new government's power was heavily dependent on finance and support from the French occupation force, as well as on the separatists' own Rhineland Protection Force, which was primarily recruited from men expelled from their homes by the French militarisation of the Ruhr. The \\"protection force\\" was poorly equipped: many members were too young to have received any military training. Their implementation of the new government's orders, in the absence of detailed instructions, was rough and ready at best, and sometimes violent. A night-time curfew was imposed and press freedom was greatly curbed. The separatist government received virtually no support from Rhineland government staff who mostly refused to acknowledge its authority or simply stayed away from their desks. In view of its French military backing, the wider population offered Dorten's r√©gime little meaningful support. From his occupation headquarters in Mainz, General Mangin would no doubt have had a far more richly calibrated appreciation of the possibilities presented by Rhenish separatism than the ministers in far away Paris: it is possible to infer, between the approach of the French commanders on the ground and priorities of the Poincar√© government, a disparity which became impossible to overlook once Dorten launched his coup in Koblenz: at the same time Paris was coming under heavy political pressure internationally over the increasingly costly French occupation of the Ruhr. In Koblenz, cabinet meetings were often combative and confused, the leaders Dorten and Matthes proving unable to contain their personal rivalries. The French power-brokers now quickly distanced themselves from the Rhenish Republic project, drastically cutting back on their financial support. The Matthes government issued Rhenish bank notes and ordered an extensive \\"Requisitioning\\" exercise: this was the signal for the Rhineland Protection Force to embark upon a level of arbitrary widespread looting which greatly exceeded anything necessary simply for feeding the hungry \\"protection troops\\". In many towns and villages the situation slid towards chaos. The civil population became increasingly hostile, and the French military found themselves attempting, with increasing difficulty, to preserve some level of order. Between 6 and 8 November, a force of Rhineland Protection Force members, calling themselves the Northern Flying Division ('), launched an attack on Maria Laach and the surrounding farmsteads. Nearby in Brohl where two residents, Anton Br√ºhl and Hans Feinlinger, had set up a local force to oppose the attackers, a death squad turned up and engaged in an orgy of plunder reminiscent, according to one commentator, of the Thirty Years‚Äô War. A father and son, belonging to the villagers' resistance force, were shot. 10 November saw an outburst of looting at Linz am Rhein: the Rathaus was taken over and the B√ºrgermeister was forced from office. From here the looters moved on to Unkel, Bruchhausen and Rheinbreitbach, on the southern rim of the Siebengebirge district. All sorts of items of evident value were \\"requisitioned\\" in addition to food and vehicles. On 12 November, the separatists gathered together close by in Bad Honnef, there intending to establish a new headquarters. The Rathaus was taken over and, two days later, the Rhenish Republic proclaimed. Food and liquor were seized in numerous hotels and residences and a large celebration took place in the Kurhaus (Health and Recreation Spa center), during which the Kurhaus furnishings went up in flames.  Siebengebirge insurrection  The Siebengebirge district consists of a series of low wooded hills wedged between the A3 Autobahn and K√∂nigswinter, a resort town on the east bank of the Rhine. Back in 1923, the construction of the A3 lay more than a decade in the future, and Bonn, located across the river from K√∂nigswinter, could still be described without irony as \\"a small town in Germany\\". It was the turn of the village called Aegidienberg to claim a place in history. On the evening of 14 November, a large number of the residents from the various small towns and villages surrounding Bad Honnef met together in an Aegidienberg guest house and resolved to resist openly the wave of looting which, they anticipated, was moving towards the southern side of the Siebengebirge area. The district was experiencing growing food shortages. Despite the weapons ban in force, the group were able to bring together a substantial arsenal, comprising not merely axes, sticks and pitchforks, but also a number of hunting weapons and handguns and other infantry weapons, presumably left over from the war. A mining engineer and former army officer named Hermann Schneider took on leadership of this ad hoc militia. It was thought that Schneider's Aegidienberg-based force now comprised about 4000 armed men. Using factory sirens and alarm bells, the local troops would be mobilised the minute separatist forces were reported or even merely rumoured to have appeared. Panic was apparent as people rushed around trying to move to safety their cattle and other chattels. During the afternoon of 15 November, a group of separatists drove two trucks into the Himberg quarter of Aegidienberg: here they were confronted by around 30 armed quarry workers. Peter Staffel, an 18-year-old blacksmith, was shot dead when he forced the trucks to stop and tried to persuade the occupants to turn back. The quarry workers thereupon showered bullets on the separatists who turned and fled along the little Schmelz valley As they fled down the twisting road, back towards Bad Honnef they encountered the local militia, well dug in and waiting for them: Schneider's men seized the trucks and then routed the separatist gang. That evening the repulsed separatists met up at the Gasthof Jagdhaus, down the Schmelz valley, and called up reinforcements. They planned a more substantial attack for the next day, in order to make an example of Aegidienberg. Accordingly, on 16 November, some 80 armed separatists found a gap in Schneider's defences at a hamlet called H√∂vel: here they seized five villagers as hostages, tied them up, and placed them in the line of fire between themselves and the now-gathering militiamen. One of the hostages, Theodor Weinz, was shot in the stomach, dying soon afterwards as a result of his injuries. Meanwhile, more local defenders hurried to the fray and set about the invaders. 14 of the separatists were killed: these were later buried in a mass grave back in Aegidienberg, without the benefit of any identifying inscription. According to contemporaries, the dead men had come originally from the Kevelaer and Krefeld areas, between the Ruhr and the Dutch border. In order to prevent further fighting, the French installed in Aegidienberg a force of French-Moroccan soldiers for the next few weeks, while military police arrived to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The investigation concluded that in total around 120 people had been killed in connection with the events of those November days. More precise information on the deaths and other events of the Aegidienberg \\"insurrection\\" may survive within the archives of the French gendarmes. Theodor Weinz, the separatists' hostage who had been fatally shot at H√∂vel, was buried in the Aegidienberg cemetery, near to its main entrance: the primary school has been named after him. Peter Staffel, the young man who had probably been the first fatality of the Siebengebirge insurrection, is buried in the cemetery at the nearby village of Eudenbach (now incorporated within the administrative ambit of K√∂nigswinter).  End of the Rhenish Republic  Following the events in Aegidienberg, the separatist cabinet based at the castle in Koblenz split into two camps. Across the province separatist governments were evicted from the Rathausen and in some instances arrested by the French military. Leo Deckers resigned his office on 27 November. On 28 November 1923, Matthes announced that he had dissolved the separatist government. Dorten had already, on 15 November, moved to Bad Ems and there established a provisional government covering the southern part of the Rhineland and the Palatinate and participated actively in the activities of the \\"Pf√§lzische Republik\\" movement, centred on Speyer, which would survived through till 1924. At the end of 1923, Dorten fled to Nice: later he relocated to the US, where he published his memoirs; Dorten was still in exile when he died in 1963. Joseph Matthes also made his way to France where he later met up with fellow journalist Kurt Tucholsky. Despite the amnesty set out in the London Agreement of August 1924, Matthes and his wife were prevented from returning to Germany, leading Tuckolsky to publish in 1929 his essay entitled For Joseph Matthes, from which are drawn his observations on conditions in the Rhineland in 1923, cited above. In the towns, the remaining separatist Burgermeister found themselves voted out of office at the end of 1923 or were, for their activities, before the courts. Konrad Adenauer, who during the period of the \\"Koblenz Government\\" had constantly been at odds with Dorten, presented to the French generals another proposal, for the creation of a west German autonomous federal state ('). Adenauer's proposal failed to impress either the French or the German government at this time, however.

He was also the principal military commander of the Albanian forces during the Vlora War in 1920. He was honored by the president with the title \\"Kalores i Urdhrit te Skenderbeut\\" in August 2020. Early life Qazim Koculi was born in 1887 in the village of Koculi, close to Vlor√´ (in the then Ottoman Empire, now modern Albania) to Muhamet Ko√ßiu. With the help of Syrja bey Vlora, Koculi received his primary education in Vlor√´ and later moved to Ioannina, today's Greece to attend the well-known Zosimea Gymnasium. He accomplished his higher education at the Kara Harp Okulu Turkish Military Academy, graduating as a Teƒümen (Second Lieutenant). He was appointed to the Ottoman Navy as a √ústeƒümen (First Lieutenant). He disobeyed a military order in 1909 during a naval battle in Preveza by refusing to surrender to the Italian Navy. After a warrant for his arrest was issued by the Imperial Command, Koculi fled to Argentina, where he resided until 1912. He then returned to Vlor√´ upon the invitation of President Ismail Qemali. The latter appointed him Director of the Port of Vlor√´, a position he held until the takeover of the port by the Italians in October 1914. He withdrew to Brataj, Vlor√´ and served as a village chief until 1917. He later served as vice prefect of Tepelen√´ until 1919. Vlora War and politics Koculi represented Vlor√´ in the Congress of Lushnj√´, a constituent assembly held in January 1920, and was hence appointed member of parliament. He was also Prefect of Vlor√´ on May 29, 1920. At the same time he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Vlora War Committee. Koculi led his army against the Italian forces in the Battle of Vlora, at the end of which, on September 3, 1920, he marched into the city and took back the duties of the Vlor√´ prefecture. Upon the establishment of a democratic government by the Congress of Lushnj√´, the first elections for the national legislature were held on April 5, 1921, Koculi won the Vlor√´ district. Koculi was Minister of Public Works in the Government of Fan Noli by pursuing a policy of opposition to King Zogu. He was one of the founders of KONARE in Vienna in 1925. With the Italian invasion of Albania of 1939, Koculi returned to Albania. He was one of the Ministers of State during the government of Mustafa Kruja, and was delegated High commissioner in Vlor√´, being so the direct governmental authority in the district. After the Battle of Gjorm, Koculi was murdered in Vlor√´ by the militia led by Halil Alia.

This 2500+ home planned unit development (PUD) was approved by the Warren County Commissioners in February 2006. Zoning approval included a central business district and multi-family housing near the center. A public referendum challenging the approval was placed on the ballot in November 2006, and the Commissioners approval was ratified by voters. Construction was to have begun in 2007, however the development was cancelled as of February 2011.Cincinnati Enquirer. Feb. 17, 2011. \\"Recession Kills Mega-Development\\" The development was to take place on a group of farms formerly owned by Ralph J. Stolle, a prominent inventor, businessman and philanthropist in Warren County. The name \\"San Mar Gale\\" came from the name of his farm, and was derived from combination of the names of Stolle's daughters, Sandy, Mary Jo, and Gail. Until Stolle's death in 1996, the farm was used as a research farm for milk production. A private airport called San Mar Gale (airport code OH79) existed on the farm until the late 1990s but has since been closed. San Mar Gale was to occupy a large portion of the area between Lebanon and Oregonia. Its approximate boundaries were Wilmington Road to the south; North Nixon Camp Road, Emmons Road, and the Little Miami River to the east; the Wayne Township line with a small portion crossing into that township, and Shoemaker Road to the north; and Liberty-Keuter Road to the west. The planned business district was centered on the intersection of Oregonia, Emmons, and Waynesville Roads. The planned community would have been in the Lebanon City School District. The eastern half would have been served by the Oregonia (45054) post office, and the western half served by the Lebanon (45036) post office. Telephone service would be in the Lebanon telephone exchange served by Embarq, public water was to be provided by Western Water Company, and sewer was to be constructed on site by the developers with plans for turning the operations over to Warren County or being operated as a private utility. The community was to be partially financed by a little used program called \\"new community authority\\",Developers pursue little-used funding tool - Business Courier of Cincinnati: which allowed cost of infrastructure to be added to the property taxes of the homeowners in the development.

These uniforms typically include the official colors and mascots of the school or team and are designed to make the wearer appear physically attractive.  Early styles/brief history  Cheerleaders from 1922 Cheerleading uniforms in the early 1900s were a steadfast symbol of the schools they represented, usually depicting the first letter of a high school or the first letter plus the letters \\"H\\" and \\"S\\", standing for \\"high school.\\" These letters were normally sewn onto a sweater-type garment, sometimes even polo shirts in warm weather. While conducive to showing school spirit and having a uniform looking team, these sweater-tops were often hot, bulky, and not very functional for any type of athletic movement. The most common type of sweater worn by early cheerleaders was a long cardigan with multiple buttons, normally worn over a turtle neck shirt or collared blouse. The school letters were often sewn in either corner of the sweater, sometimes in the middle of a megaphone shape. Worn with the sweater was a very modest ankle-length wool skirt, often a darker color than the sweater. Some early cheerleading squads chose plaid fabrics for skirts, often these squads were from religious schools and universities, as plaid was the main fabric of their classroom uniforms. A cheerleader in 1956 Early cheerleading squads wore saddle shoes or flat canvas sneakers with high dress socks with their uniforms. This style of uniform continued through the 1950s and 1960s and is often depicted in movies and photos from that time period. One of the first companies to produce cheerleading uniforms was Cheerleader Supply Company, founded in 1948. The company was founded by Lawrence \\"Herkie\\" Herkimer, of Dallas, TX,a former cheerleader at Southern Methodist University, who began selling pom pom kits to local high schools. Herkie was also the first to organize cheerleading camps and competitions.  Modern styles of cheerleading uniforms  As the focus of cheerleading shifted from an auxiliary unit, to an athletic pursuits, changes in the uniforms' material, style and fit were necessary. = 1960s uniforms = As fashion styles changed through the 1960s so did the cheerleading uniform. Gone were the overly long wool skirts, as pleated shorter skirts became more popular. The long skirt was essentially chopped in half as knee length cotton fabric skirts made for easier movement and a more comfortable experience for the wearer as compared to their wool counterparts. The sweater top changed dramatically, squads elected to wear short sleeve crew neck sweaters in favor of long cardigans, however the school letters and megaphone emblem remained, now being placed in the center of the stylish crew neck sweaters. Some squads in this time period, in particular high school squads, favored placing an additional embroidered emblem with the squad member's name on the center of the school letter patch. This was a symbol of high school popularity, as it was a huge privilege to be a cheerleader = 1970s uniforms = Much changed in uniform fashion from the 1960s. Most squads now wore more athletic [material] or tennis shoes. Cheerleaders wore sneakers as opposed to saddle shoes or Keds, and the uniform was made less bulky to allow for easier movement. Also more variety was available for sweaters, vests or shells and skirts. The sweater now featured a stripe pattern on the front, in alternating school colors. The letter patch became more elaborate as well, often more colorful and unique. Sweaters were also less bulky and had a more flattering fit. This new slimmed style allowed better movement and more of a functional fit, without sacrificing modesty or tradition. Sweaters were made to fit close to the body for a tighter fit, and the length was tapered very short to eliminate excess fabric overlapping the skirt. Often this caused the cheerleader's bare abdomen to be exposed during movement- by now most sweaters were worn without any shirt or collared blouse beneath them. Different styles were incorporated to give squads more of a choice. Round neck, and v-neck sweaters were popular with squads seeking greater functionality, as cheerleading was becoming more athletic instead of the standard vocal chant. The new sweater styles allowed squads to eliminate the extra collared blouse beneath the sweater, essentially just wearing the sweater over a bra. While these uniforms provided a functional style, some modest women in society viewed these outfits as scandalous and racy. The shorter skirts combined with the shorter and tighter sweaters were viewed by some as \\"improper.\\" =1985‚Äì1995 uniforms= Theses uniforms are similar to the current uniforms except slouch socks especially Wigwam slouch socks were very popular to wear. Also Keds champion sneakers were worn by many cheerleaders. A typical school cheerleading uniform from 1985 does not look much different than a uniform today. The favored top in this period was a waist-length button-down sleeveless vest, worn with or without a turtleneck layer underneath. The vest top was a modest style, and was mostly un-revealing. Also seen as a uniform top was a turtleneck worn underneath a sweatshirt. The choice skirt remained a pleat model, but with added color striping around the bottom hem. The length style preferred was shortened to mid-thigh or slightly longer for most squads. The general rule at this time was the skirt had to be down the end of fingers when arm down at side. Bike shorts were worn underneath with some uniforms. = Current uniforms = Most uniforms are currently made from a polyester blended fabric, usually containing spandex as well. Shiny foiled covered stretch fabric is commonly found in competitive cheerleading uniforms. Dye- sublimated uniforms have also become increasingly popular in recent years. Dye-sublimated uniforms have a design, team name, or logo printed directly on the garment using a dye-sublimation printer and can give a cheer squad a more individual look with a lower cost. The top without the sleeves are called shells, if they have sleeves it is called a liner. Most American school squads wear a sleeveless top with either a sports bra or an athletic tank top underneath. If the shell lacks sleeves, many teams wear a turtle neck bodysuit under it, although this is not required specifically. The bodysuits can be either leotard like or covering only to the bottom of the ribcage. Due to guidelines imposed by the National Federation of High Schools, high school squads must have a top that covers their midriff with arms by their sides, however if the arms are raised most uniforms will show a small section of midriff, which is not against NFSHSA rules. Most school-sanctioned squads have modest-looking uniform tops that are usually a waist-length fit, covering the whole frontal upper body except at the shoulders and arms when worn sleeveless. Likewise, the back construction of most school cheerleading tops cover the full upper body, however skin in the lower back area is mostly left uncovered if the cheerleader is sitting or bending; this does not violate NFSHSA uniform rules. These requirements do not apply to all-star cheerleading organizations, therefore many have tops that stop at or just below the bottom of the bra line. Another growing trend among all-star teams is having sections of material missing (allowing bare skin to show) across the top for the chest, the shoulders, the top of the back, or portions of the arms. The length of skirts has shortened dramatically, with the average length for skirts at both high school and all-star being 10 to 13 inches, and lengths are shrinking every year, however, some coaches and various team sponsors encourage wearing shorter skirts due to safety reasons (too much fabric can be dangerous while tumbling). Skirts are worn over top of colored or metallic spandex/polyester briefs, also called lollies, spankies, or bundies. These briefs are worn over top of underwear and are sometimes printed with stars, dots, etc. The briefs can also sometimes have a team logo, such as a paw print, sewn on the side or across the behind.

During competition, most federations also enforce such bans. While there is no official ban on tattoos, school-sanctioned squads typically require that tattoos that could be visible in uniform, be covered with a bandage or waterproof skin shade makeup. Due to the popularity of lower back tattoos, this method is becoming increasingly commonplace.  Cheerleading uniform terminology  ; Ribbons/bows : Worn in the cheerleader's hair, which is often styled to match each other. The ribbons are usually the school's or the team's colors, and can be custom made or ordered through various companies. ; Bodysuit/bodyliner : A leotard-like undergarment that matches the uniform colors and design, and is intended to be worn underneath the uniform shell. Normally these are long-sleeved tops that snap at the bottom but they can be customized to the length of the shell top, either in a waist-length design or a crop-top style. Most squads prefer to wear bodysuits during competition as it creates a uniformed look in arm movements. Waist length shells can be worn with several styles of bodyliners, in contrast to midriff shells which are limited to cropped stomach-showing liners. Full coverage bodyliners worn under a waist length shell eliminate all midriff exposure during cheering. A cropped liner worn under a waist-length shell will cover the arms but leaves the stomach uncovered, allowing midriff skin to still show just as if the shell were to be worn alone. ; Shell/vest : Made out of polyester and cotton, this is the main focal point of the uniform. This is the top of the outfit which includes the design of the uniform stripes, school/team colors, and the mascot or high school insignias or school letters. Example: \\"Willow High School\\" would be \\"WHS\\". The shell is normally sleeveless with a \\"V\\" neckline, however the neckline style can often be customized by the school or team during the uniform ordering process. The shell can either have a zipper closure in the back or side to aid in dressing, or it can have a stretchy material that allows the top to expand slightly when dressing. The shell is designed to fit somewhat snug but not tight on the wearer‚Äîit should fit close to the body. The shell can be worn alone over a bra or camisole, or it can be worn over-top a bodysuit of choice or a simple turtleneck. This is usually up to each squad's preference. A shell top is available in many lengths and even in somewhat intricate style cues. ; Full shell : Usually sleeveless, and having a simple style design. It is normally waist length, ending at the top of the skirt. Typically worn alone with a bra underneath. This style top is worn by most American school squads as it is very modest and meets most dress codes, with midriff exposure limited to bare lower backs and an inch of frontal skin while the arms are raised. The sleeveless shell, if worn alone, will normally leave the arms and shoulders open. A properly fitted shell top is essential in making the uniform look flattering for everyone on the cheer squad. A shell that is properly sized and fitted will leave enough room around the arm openings for movement, eliminating fabric rubbing against the underarms. Additionally, if the shell is sized with the correct measurements, the bottom of the hem should be long enough to meet the top of the skirt while standing stationary. These tops can be highly customized from very ordinary to highly detailed designs. Certain cut-outs in sections of the garment are an option, as are varying hemlines for the bottom of the top. For instance, instead of a straight hem along the bottom of the top, some squads will choose a \\"cut-up V\\" hem, which leaves an upside down \\"V\\" notch open along the front, leaving slight midriff exposed at the belly button area. This style is selected to allow for an additional color stripe along the bottom hem of the shell. ; Halter shell : Similar in style and length as a full fitting shell top, but differing in the upper part of the garment. This top is normally fully sleeveless, and more revealing of the upper back. The halter style normally includes a neck strap on the top that ties in the back. ; Crop top/midriff : This style of top is mostly used by colleges and out-of-school squads (all- star squads). It is very revealing, and rarely worn by high school squads due to dress code violations. The top is typically worn sleeveless with only a bra underneath. The school's or team's logo is featured in the center of the top. The top ends right after the bra-line leaving the entire midriff of the cheerleader showing. The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) instituted a rule against cropped uniform tops at the high school level. Most cheerleading governing bodies outlaw this top from being worn by public schools in competition, however a few middle and high schools still choose to wear this style of top at their respective non-competing events, such as football games or parades. There has been much debate on whether it is right to have a teenage girl wearing a garment like this at a public school, as much of the body is revealed by this top. ; Skirt : The bottom of a cheerleading uniform, with matching colors and logo/stripe design as the shell. Skirts can be very customizable with various styles of pleat designs, or no pleats at all, such as an \\"A-line\\" skirt. The general rule of length for skirts is mid-thigh and can be sized simply by using the \\"fingertip\\" rule. Modern skirts are offered in various rises as well. Traditionally the skirt should be worn at the natural waistline, at the navel area. The traditional skirt should be high enough to touch the bottom of the shell slightly. However some squads elect to wear low-rise skirts either with longer shells or with a normal length shell creating a midriff look. Bundies must be worn under the skirt.

History The airport was officially opened on 12 December 1931, by the Minister for Trade and Customs, the Hon. Frank Forde, M.H.R., as a civilian airport. The airport was renamed in 1936 to Hinkler Airport after Bundabergs famous aviator Bert Hinkler ,...Bundaberg is proud of its aviator Bert Hinkler...On her first country visit in Queensland the Queen landed at Hinkler Airport, Bundaberg... =World War II= With the outbreak of World War II, it was decided as part of the Empire Air Training Scheme to requisition Bundaberg Airport and develop it as a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Flying Training School. Known as RAAF Station Bundaberg it was initially used in 1941 by No. 12 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF (12 EFTS), until 12 EFTS relocated to Lowood Aerodrome (located at Tarampa) on 12 January 1942.

Biography Marie Helene Frauendorfer was born in Frauenstein in Upper Austria. She attended Catholic boarding school in Linz, and went on to study German literature in Vienna and in Graz. After her school years she settled in Steyr. In 1941, she married Manfred Haushofer, a dentist, and had two sons, Christian and Manfred. They divorced in 1950, only to remarry each other in 1958. Work Earning literary awards as early as 1953, Haushofer went on to publish her first novel, A Handful of Life in 1955. In 1956, she won the Theodor-K√∂rner Prize for early contributions and projects involving art and culture. In 1958, her novella We Murder Stella was published. The Wall, considered her finest achievement, was completed in 1963. The novel was written out four times in longhand between 1960 and 1963, but had to wait until 1968, two years before Haushofer's death, to be printed. In a letter written to a friend in 1961, Marlen describes the difficulty with its composition: > I am writing on my novel and everything is very cumbersome because I never > have much time, and mainly because I can not embarrass myself.

There are a number of philosophies about charity, often associated with religion. Effective altruism is the use of evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to help others.  Etymology  The word charity originated in late Old English to mean a \\"Christian love of one's fellows,\\" and up until at least the beginning of the 20th century, this meaning remained synonymous with charity. Aside from this original meaning, charity is etymologically linked to Christianity, with the word originally entering into the English language through the Old French word \\"charit√©\\", which was derived from the Latin \\"caritas\\", a word commonly used in the Vulgate New Testament to translate the Greek word agape (), a distinct form of \\"love\\" (see the article: Charity (virtue)). Over time, the meaning of charity has shifted from one of \\"Christian love\\" to that of \\"providing for those in need; generosity and giving,\\" a transition which began with the Old French word charit√©. Thus, while the older Douay-Rheims and King James versions of the Bible translate instances of \\"agape\\" (such as those that appear in 1 Corinthians 13) as \\"charity\\", modern English versions of the Bible typically translate \\"agape\\" as \\"love.\\"  Practice  A Hindu Woman Giving Alms, painting by Raja Ravi Varma Charitable giving is the act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate, either directly or by means of a charitable trust or other worthy cause. Charitable giving as a religious act or duty is referred to as almsgiving or alms. The name stems from the most obvious expression of the virtue of charity; giving the recipients of it the means they need to survive. The impoverished, particularly those widowed or orphaned, and the ailing or injured, are generally regarded as the proper recipients of charity. The people who cannot support themselves and lack outside means of support sometimes become \\"beggars\\", directly soliciting aid from strangers encountered in public. Some groups regard charity as being distributed towards other members from within their particular group. Although giving to those nearly connected to oneself is sometimes called charity‚Äîas in the saying \\"Charity begins at home\\"‚Äînormally charity denotes giving to those not related, with filial piety and like terms for supporting one's family and friends. Indeed, treating those related to the giver as if they were strangers in need of charity has led to the figure of speech \\"as cold as charity\\"‚Äîproviding for one's relatives as if they were strangers, without affection. Most forms of charity are concerned with providing basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, healthcare and shelter, but other actions may be performed as charity: visiting the imprisoned or the homebound, ransoming captives, educating orphans, even social movements. Donations to causes that benefit the unfortunate indirectly, such as donations to fund cancer research, are also charity. With regards to religious aspects, the recipient of charity may offer to pray for the benefactor. In medieval Europe, it was customary to feast the poor at the funeral in return for their prayers for the deceased. Institutions may commemorate benefactors by displaying their names, up to naming buildings or even the institution itself after the benefactors. If the recipient makes material return of more than a token value, the transaction is normally not called charity. In the past century, many charitable organizations have created a \\"charitable model\\" in which donators give to conglomerates give to recipients. Examples of this include the Make a Wish Foundation (John Cena holds the title for most wishes granted by a single individual, with over 450 wishes) and the World Wildlife Fund. Today some charities have modernized, and allow people to donate online, through websites such as JustGiving. Originally charity entailed the benefactor directly giving the goods to the receiver. This practice was continued by some individuals, for example, \\"CNN Hero\\" Sal Dimiceli, and service organizations, such as the Jaycees. With the rise of more social peer-to-peer processes, many charities are moving away from the charitable model and starting to adopt this more direct donator to recipient approach. Examples of this include Global Giving (direct funding of community development projects in developing countries), DonorsChoose (for US-based projects), PureCharity, Kiva (funding loans administered by microfinance organizations in developing countries) and Zidisha (funding individual microfinance borrowers directly). Institutions evolved to carry out the labor of assisting the poor, and these institutions, called charities, provide the bulk of charitable giving today, in terms of monetary value. These include orphanages, food banks, religious institutes dedicated to care of the poor, hospitals, organizations that visit the homebound and imprisoned, and many others. Such institutions allow those whose time or inclination does not lend themselves to directly care for the poor to enable others to do so, both by providing money for the work and supporting them while they do the work. Institutions can also attempt to more effectively sort out the actually needy from those who fraudulently claim charity. Early Christians particularly recommended the care of the unfortunate to the charge of the local bishop. There have been examinations of who gives more to charity. One study conducted in the United States found that as a percentage of income, charitable giving increased as income decreased. The poorest fifth of Americans, for example, gave away 4.3% of their income, while the wealthiest fifth gave away 2.1%. In absolute terms, this was an average of $453 on an average income of $10,531, compared to $3,326 on an income of $158,388.\\"America's poor are its most generous donors\\" , by Frank Greve, McClatchy Newspapers as appears in the Seattle Times, published May 23, 2009 Studies have also found that ‚Äúindividuals who are religious are more likely to give money to charitable organizations‚Äù and they are also more likely to give more money than those who are not religious. Among those individuals are members of American religious communities, about whom the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding conducted a recent study regarding philanthropic and charitable giving. The study found that American Muslim donation patterns when it comes to charitable giving align mostly with other American faith groups, like Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish communities, but that American Muslims were more likely to donate out of a sense of religious obligation and a belief that those who have ought to give to those who do not. The study also found that most American faith groups prioritize charity towards their own houses of worship when it comes to monetary donations, and then other causes. Muslims and Jews contributed more than other religious groups to civil rights protection organizations, while white Evangelical Christians, followed by Protestants and then Catholics, were the most likely to make charitable contributions to youth and family services. = Criticism = A philosophical critique of charity can be found in Oscar Wilde's essay The Soul of Man Under Socialism, where he calls it \\"a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution . . . usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over [the poor's] private lives\\", as well as a remedy that prolongs the \\"disease\\" of poverty, rather than curing it. Wilde's thoughts are cited with approval by Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek, and the Slovenian thinker adds his description of the effect of charity on the charitable: Friedrich Engels, in his 1845 treatise on the condition of the working class in England, points out that charitable giving, whether by governments or individuals, is often seen by the givers as a means to conceal suffering that is unpleasant to see. Engels quotes from a letter to the editor of an English newspaper who complains that ::streets are haunted by swarms of beggars, who try to awaken the pity of the passers-by in a most shameless and annoying manner, by exposing their tattered clothing, sickly aspect, and disgusting wounds and deformities. I should think that when one not only pays the poor-rate, but also contributes largely to the charitable institutions, one had done enough to earn a right to be spared such disagreeable and impertinent molestations. The English bourgeoisie, Engels concludes, ::is charitable out of self-interest; it gives nothing outright, but regards its gifts as a business matter, makes a bargain with the poor, saying: \\"If I spend this much upon benevolent institutions, I thereby purchase the right not to be troubled any further, and you are bound thereby to stay in your dusky holes and not to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery. You shall despair as before, but you shall despair unseen, this I require, this I purchase with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infirmary!\\" It is infamous, this charity of a Christian bourgeois!The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845), Penguin edition (1987), p. 277. The Institute of Economic Affairs published a report in 2012 called \\"Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why\\", which criticised the phenomenon of governments funding charities which then lobby the government for changes which the government wanted all along.  Needs-Based Versus Rights-Based Debate  Increasing awareness of poverty and food insecurity has led to debates among scholars about the Needs-Based versus the Rights-Based Approach. The Needs-Based approach solely provides recipients what they need, not expecting any action in response. Examples of needs-based approaches include charitable giving, philanthropy, and other private investments. A Rights-Based approach, on the other hand, includes participation from both ends, with the recipients being active influences on policies. Politically, a Rights-Based approach would be illustrated in policies of income redistribution, wage floors, and cash subsidies. Mariana Chilton, in the American Journal of Public Health, suggests that current government policies reflect the Needs-Based Approach. Chilton argues this leads to a misconception that charity is the cure for basic needs insecurity. This misconception drives the government to avoid welfare reform and instead to rely on charitable organizations and philanthropists. Amelia Barwise of the American Journal of Public Health supports Chilton‚Äôs argument by describing the consequences of philanthropy. Using an example of Michael Bloomberg‚Äôs donation of $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins University for student debts, Barwise questions the most effective use for this money. She lists one motivation of philanthropy as to avoid paying federal taxes, so the donor may be recognized for their generosity and send their earned money to organizations they are passionate about. Barwise therefore implies that Bloomberg‚Äôs actions resemble this reason, since he has saved $600 million in federal taxes and donated the money to his alma mater. Furthermore, this non-politicized idea of philanthropy and charitable giving is linked to the government‚Äôs approach to poverty. Barwise discusses that Americans have an innate distrust of the government, causing them to favor private and de-politicized actions such as charity. Her research finds consequences of philanthropic actions and how the money can be used more effectively. First, Barwise states that since philanthropy allows for tax evasion, this decreases opportunities for welfare policies that would support all low-income workers. Furthermore, philanthropy can diminish the institution‚Äôs mission and give more power and influence to the donor. Acknowledging these consequences of philanthropy and the diminishing of public funding, Mariana Chilton offers solutions to the rights-based approach. Chilton argues that the government should adopt a more rights-based approach to include more people in their policies and significantly improve basic needs insecurity. She calls for government accountability, an increase of transparency, an increase of public participation, and the acknowledgement of vulnerability and discrimination caused by current policies. She argues for increased federal legislation that provides social safety nets through entitlement programs, recognizing SNAP as a small example. Chilton concludes with a list of four strategies to a national plan: 1) increase monitoring system to assess threats to food insecurity, 2) improve national, state, and local coordination, 3) improve accountability, and 4) utilize public participation to help construct policies.  Philosophies  = Charity in Christianity = In medieval Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, Latin Christendom underwent a charitable revolution.J. W. Brodman, Charity and Religion in Medieval Europe (2009) Rich patrons founded many leprosaria and hospitals for the sick and poor. New confraternities and religious orders emerged with the primary mission of engaging in intensive charitable work. Historians debate the causes. Some argue that this movement was spurred by economic and material forces, as well as a burgeoning urban culture. Other scholars argue that developments in spirituality and devotional culture were central. For still other scholars, medieval charity was primarily a way to elevate one's social status and affirm existing hierarchies of power.Adam J. Davis, \\"The Social and Religious Meanings of Charity in Medieval Europe\\" History Compass (2014) 12#12 pp 935‚Äì950 = Tzedakah in Judaism = Sandstone vestige of a Jewish gravestone depicting a Tzedakah box (pushke). Jewish cemetery in Otwock (Karczew-Anielin), Poland. In Judaism, tzedakah‚Äîa Hebrew term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify charityRabbi Hayim Halevy Donin; \\"To Be A Jew\\". Basic Books, New York; 1972, pp. 48.‚Äîrefers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just.Tzedakah vs The Myth of Charity; by Yanki Tauber; Retrieved 03-11-2012. Because it is commanded by the Torah and not voluntary, the practice is not technically an act of charity; such a concept is virtually nonexistent in Jewish tradition. Jews give tzedakah, which can take the form of money, time and resources to the needy, out of \\"righteousness\\" and \\"justice\\" rather than benevolence, generosity, or charitableness. The Torah requires that 10 percent of a Jew's income be allotted to righteous deeds or causes, regardless if the receiving party is rich or poor. = Zakat and Sadaqa in Islam = In Islam there are two methods of charity. One called Zakat, the other is called Sadaqa. Zakat is one of the five pillars upon which the Muslim religion is based, where 2.5% of one's saving is compulsory to be given as Zakat per Islamic calendar year, provided that the saving is beyond the threshold limit, called Nisab, usually determined by the religious authority. Sadaqa is voluntary charity or contribution. Sadaqa can be given using money, personal items, time or other resources. There is no minimum or maximum requirement for Sadaqa. Even smiling to other people is considered a Sadaqa. = DƒÅna in Indian religions = The practice of charity is called DƒÅna or Daana in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It is the virtue of generosity or giving.William Owen Cole (1991), Moral Issues in Six Religions, Heinemann, , pages 104‚Äì105Krishnan & Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, , pages 365‚Äì366. DƒÅna has been defined in traditional texts, state Krishnan and Manoj,Krishnan & Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, , pages 361‚Äì382; summary of the article as ‚Äúany action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return‚Äù. Karna, Mahabali and Harishchandra are heroes also known for giving charity. The earliest known discussion of charity as a virtuous practice, in Indian texts, is in Rigveda.The Rig Veda, Mandala 10, Hymn 117, Ralph T. H. Griffith (Translator)R Hindery, Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol 2, Number 1, page 105. According to other ancient texts of Hinduism, dƒÅna can take the form of feeding or giving to an individual in distress or need.Anushasana Parva, Section LIX The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, pages 310‚Äì311. It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.Anushasana Parva, Section LVIII The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Published by P.C.

This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.: 236, 238. Historical records, such as those by the Persian historian Ab≈´ Ray·∏•ƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ who visited India in early 11th century, suggest dƒÅna has been an ancient and medieval era practice among Indian religions.Alberuni's India (v. 2), Chapter LXVII, On Alms and how a man must spend what he earns, Columbia University Libraries, London : Kegan Paul, Tr√ºbner & Co., (1910), pages 149‚Äì150.Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, , pages 4‚Äì6. =Effective altruism= Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. Effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values. It is the broad, evidence-based and cause-neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity. Effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices. While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit. People associated with the movement include philosopher Peter Singer, Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz, Cari Tuna, Ben Delo, Oxford-based researchers William MacAskill and Toby Ord, professional poker player Liv Boeree, and writer Jacy Reese Anthis.

It was Kafka's first published book, printed at the end of 1912 (with the publication year given as \\"1913\\") in the Rowohlt Verlag on an initiative by Kurt Wolff. Eight of these stories were published before under the title Betrachtungen (\\"Contemplations\\") in the bimonthly Hyperion.Kafka, Franz. The Complete Stories. New York: Schocken Books, 1995 p. 472-473. The collection Description of a Struggle, published in 1958, includes some of the stories In English, in whole or in part. All the stories appear in The Complete Stories of Franz Kafka (1971) and were published in a single volume edition by Twisted Spoon Press, illustrated by Fedele Spadafora. They have also been translated by Malcolm Pasley and are available in the Penguin Books edition, The Transformation and Other Stories (1992). The book was printed in 800 editions and had in a year (1 July 1915 ‚Äì 30 June 1916) sold 258 copies, the book wasn't sold out until 1924, the year Kafka died.  The Stories  = \\"Children on a Country Road\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". Narrated by an unnamed little child, this short story follows her thoughts as she experiences childhood nighttime escapades. The plot begins with this little child on a swing watching passing carts of laborers returning from the fields. After dinner, she ventures into the woods and plays a game with other village children. The game is similar to king-of-the-hill, where the girls are pushed into deep ditches by boys. Later, she goes to the train-tracks and sings. ‚ÄúWhen you mix your voice with others you are caught like a fish on a hook.‚Äù The night ends with our narrator kissing a boy, and hearing from him rumors of the next village where the residents never sleep. This story has a tone of innocence, playfulness, and retrospection as the reader is transported into the mind of an eight- or nine-year-old girl. Images of big grown-ups, ever- deepening ditches, and youthful recklessness serve to further our impression of this child as an innocent adventurer. The fact that the narrator's name and gender is never specified allows the story to maintain a level of non- specificity. These themes can transcend time and place, so as to capture the thoughts of a child living in anytime or anyplace. This story is from an unpublished second version of \\"Description of a Struggle\\". = \\"Unmasking a Confidence Trickster\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". The narrator, ostensibly a recent immigrant from the country, arrives at the doorway of a grand house, having been invited to a social engagement, accompanied by a man whose fellowship he has not solicited, and with whom the narrator is only slightly acquainted. Evidently reluctant to remain with the man any longer, the narrator prepares to enter the house, but is detained by the other, who stretches out his arm toward the house and smiles as a mood of silence overtakes them both. The narrator, snapping out of his funk, suddenly recognizes his companion for a confidence trickster who stands to take advantage of his relative naivet√©, and is embarrassed that it has taken him so long to realize this fact. \\"Caught in the act!\\" says the narrator, who immediately excuses himself, and, with a sense of relief, enters the houses. It is left for the reader to judge the legitimacy of his accusation. Two early drafts appear in Kafka's diaries of 1910. In 1912 he wrote that he completed \\"Confidence Trickster,\\" saying of it \\"more or less satisfactory.\\" = \\"The Sudden Walk\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". This contemplation tells the story of a renaissance. It is a reawakening of the human mind; the man in the story is jerked into an awareness of his own potency that arises simply out of his being human. He has been lulled into a kind of vegetable state by routine and convention; he needs a meaningless piece of work or entertainment just to occupy his sleeping mind. As petty excuses run through his mind (it is cold, it is evening), a ‚Äúfit of restlessness‚Äù raises him to his feet. What is it inside this man that slaps him awake from his customary lethargy? His mind has changed suddenly, and he has to redress himself before he goes out and ‚Äúrediscovers himself down in the street.‚Äù At first, the man is especially aware of the power of his body: ‚Äúyour limbs responding with particular agility to the unexpected freedom you have procured for them.‚Äù Then he is overcome by the power of a decisive act: action has the ability to change. The man‚Äôs awareness of his being has given him independence, but it has not entirely isolated him. He has broken away from his family, who are headed for ‚Äúthe void‚Äù, but awareness of his ability to act allows him to seek companionship; perhaps in staying among his sleepy family members, the man was isolating himself from his friends. Perhaps friendship and love are only possible for an active person. Appeared in Kafka's diaries in 1912. Transcendent Analysis. Who are you? = \\"Resolutions\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". \\"Resolutions\\" begins with the narrator planning to put on a false exterior and pretend to be something he is not. He must hide his ‚Äúmiserable mood‚Äù and act as though he is happy and social. He plans how he will behave towards A, B and C even though he knows it will all be false. He soon realizes that with just one slip in this act, he will ruin his social exterior and reveal to A, B and C his true feelings. He then decides it would be better to just erase all emotions and act neither happy nor depressed, but rather like an animal observing. It rises into question whether or not putting on an act is really worth it. Do we really need to pretend to be happy or social when all we truly want to do is sulk in a chair? The narrator claims it is easier to just to ‚Äúthrottle down whatever ghostly life remains in you‚Äù and refrain from any sort of human actions. From his diaries, 1911. = \\"Excursion into the Mountains\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". \\"Excursion into the Mountains\\" is a passage about an individual isolating himself from reality. The passage is written in the first person, allowing the reader to fully connect to the thoughts and emotions of the speaker. Kafka's works often depict a passive individual who wants to stray away from the realities of life; this passage is no different, ‚ÄúI cried without being heard, I do not know, if nobody comes, then nobody comes‚Ä¶a pack of nobodies would be rather fine‚Äù. The narrator illustrates self- imposed isolation through images of mountains, a group of ‚Äúnobodies‚Äù linked together going through the mountains, and the vivid image of the ‚Äúnobodies‚Äù happily scavenging through the mountains. This is ironic because the reader can depict these images in any way they want, but based on the descriptions by Kafka it seems to be that the speaker is alone and him going into the mountains with this group of ‚Äúnobodies‚Äù is him isolating himself from society. From \\"Description of a Struggle\\". = \\"Bachelor's Ill Luck\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". Also called ‚ÄúThe Fate of a Bachelor,‚Äù this story is written in the third person. The narrator is describing the life of a bachelor and the increasing loneliness of that comes with the passing of time and no one with whom to share it. For example, the narrator imagines the bachelor lying sick in a room that is empty of any family to care for him or having to repeatedly explain to others that he does not have any children of his own. The dominant motif in this story is loneliness. = \\"The Businessman\\" = The original German title is \\"\\" (The merchant). This short story is narrated through the perspective of a businessman. It is spoken in first person. In a world where he is experiencing a never-ending feeling of dissatisfaction, the businessman lives a mentally desolate life. He begins with describing the mental and physical stress that his work causes him such as aches, worry, anxiety, and fear. Although he is surrounded by other individuals and finds himself worrying about their problems, they are ‚Äústrangers; their circumstances remain a mystery to me [him]‚Äù (p. 21). He imagines that these secretive individuals are having a far grander time than he is; ‚ÄúThey have grown extravagant and are giving a banquet in some restaurant garden, and others are stopping off at this party‚Äù (p. 21). When he gets off work, he is liberated from the stressful demands of his business. He goes further to describe his excitement and anticipation for this time that he has to do whatever he wishes. He turns this anticipation, however, to no purpose and he simply decides to walk home and suddenly the tone of the passage swings to slightly depressing and lonesome. His imagination wanders and he paints a vivid picture in the reader‚Äôs mind of an out of body experience that occurs when he gets to the elevator in his apartment building. He describes a man being robbed and then walking ‚Äúsorrowfully‚Äù down a street alone; one can make an analogy that the businessman is being robbed of his soul and is being taken advantage of by his ceaseless work. The businessman feels he is in battle with his own personal needs of happiness and the ‚Äúincessant demands of my [his] business‚Äù (p. 21). At the end of the story, although it is obvious that he has gained wealth from his business, he is lonely and unsatisfied. = \\"Absent- minded Window-gazing\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". The story is also known as \\"A Stray Glance From The Window\\". Early in the story, the sky was blue, then the speaker observes a little girl, strolling along with the light on her face, when she suddenly falls into the shadow of a man, briskly approaching her. Then the man passes her and \\"by then the face of the child is quite bright.\\" = \\"The Way Home\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". This story is told in first person by an unknown narrator as he walks home along a street after a thunderstorm. The power of the newly calmed air brings him to reflect upon his power over everything that happens along the street. This reflection leads him to weigh his past against his future and he concludes that there is nothing to criticize in his life except for his unjust amount of good fortune. Although the narrator can find no imperfections in his life, the tone is not boastful. Instead, the narrator is simply contemplating the importance of his life and his accomplishments. The tone even becomes slightly melancholic as the narrator fails to find meaning in his life despite all his good fortune. It is not until he reenters his house, that the narrator enters into a state of true internal mediation and evaluation. He tries to find some aspect of his life to reflect upon, but finds nothing of importance. He throws open the window, unlocking a gate to reveal the outside world, and music pours in. This breach in the shelter of his house allows real life to intrude upon his realm of contemplation, banishing any opportunity for true reflection. = \\"Passers-by\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". Also known as \\"The Men Passing By\\", the narrator contemplates the vision of a man running past him down the street during the night. This man is followed by another man, and the narrator lets them run by. The narrator imagines several scenarios between these two men running past him. These scenarios include the two playing a game, the first running away from the second, or the two teaming up to catch an unknown third person. Depending on the scenario the narrator feels that he would have different responsibilities. After these images pass through his mind he begins to think that the two could have nothing to do with each other, they could be sleepwalking or returning home to their families. He then meditates on the image of the first man being the one in trouble, him being armed. The imagery in this short story is very important because, as the narrator changes his idea of the relationship between the two men, the image of the two men shifts drastically. The tone changes drastically with the narrator's change of scenario because he sets or takes away blame from one of the men, or the other. The theme of ‚ÄúThe Men Passing By‚Äù is that of guilt and perception. The narrator's level of guilt changes with each shift of scenario and perception because, depending on the scenario, he feels that he needs to decide whether or not to intervene. Adaptations in Austrian Sign Language were done by the deaf actor Werner M√∂ssler . = \\"On the Tram\\" = The original German title is \\"\\" (The passenger). \\"On the Tram\\" is a short story told in first-person perspective. It describes a man standing on a tram platform, contemplating the uncertainties of his place in the world. At one point, a woman approaches the tram and the narrator is struck by her vibrance. The story focuses on images of the uncertainty of existence and one's purpose in the world, and the tone is contemplative and existential. The man on the tram cannot even defend the fact that he is on the tram, holding onto the strap, and watching people move about in the streets. When he sees the woman, however, his perspective changes. The narrator sees the girl ‚Äúas distinctly as if [he] had run [his] hands over her.‚Äù He goes on to describe the woman's physical attributes with incredible detail, from her clothing to her hair. He ends his contemplation by wondering, ‚ÄúHow is it that she is not astonished at herself, that she keeps her lips closed and says nothing of that kind?‚Äù Although the narrator does not understand his own place in the world, he understands the woman's with strange clarity. An adaptation in Austrian Sign Language was done by the deaf actor Horst Dittrich . = \\"Clothes\\" = The original German title is \\"\\" (Dresses). \\"Clothes\\" is constructed of three paragraphs with three significant points to sum up the entirety of the short story. It is told from the first person perspective of a very observant person, hypothesized to be a man observing women. Paragraph one essentially states that beautiful things exist but do not last forever. It questions women who wear beautiful things that will eventually lose value, asking, why should one indulge in something that will result in worthlessness? The second paragraph comments on how beauty should not be confined or committed to just one person, place or thing. And lastly, the third paragraph is somewhat connected to the second; familiarity is to worthlessness. Clothes are what capture the eye but if personality cannot carry its own weight, flaws will show and the worthlessness of the clothes will reflect on the worthlessness of the woman. Kafka uses symbolism such as the looking-glass to represent the mirror and the clothing, dresses, as a representation of the women. From Description of a Struggle. = \\"The Rejection\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". Told from the perspective of a man who is discussing what happens when he meets a pretty girl, \\"The Rejection\\" is structured as an imagined dialogue between this man and a hypothetical 'pretty girl'. The narrator says that she will go by without saying a word, but imagines that what she means is that she does not want anything to do with him. This is also imbued with a series of images relating to lovemaking, with mention of a limousine which 'carries you in long thrusts swaying through the street' and an 'escort of gentlemen, pressed into their suitings, following behind you in a strict semicircle and murmuring their blessings on your head.' The images also present of sexual desire, ranging from commenting on the girl's breasts to her thighs and hips. The taffeta dress she is wearing represents delight, though the story's tone is told with a sense of longing and a sense of frustration evident in the narrator's attempt at chasing women, with themes focusing on love, sexuality, and rejection. The story's conclusion also brings about the existential realization of both the narrator and the pretty girl that they are not as important as they think they are. Since both lack what the other party deems as qualities of a good mate, they \\"go [their] separate ways home\\" as to keep them \\"from being irrefutably aware of [their mediocrity]\\". = \\"Reflections for Gentlemen-Jockeys\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". The story is also known as \\"For the Consideration of Amateur Jockeys\\". Told from the perspective of a jockey, the narrator tells the reader about the dangers and consequences of being a jockey. The narrator uses images of envious opponents, successful and unsuccessful gambling friends, and women looking down upon the pride of the winners. The tone used in the story is that of a wiser, seasoned veteran warning amateurs and rookies of the consequences of their sport. The story focuses in depth on the unfortunate events that take place after a victory. The narrator goes on to tell of the envy of the losers and how their influences in the community will create distress for the victor. The narrator also goes on to describe the fortunes and misfortunes of friends, of those who gambled for one's victory and those who did not fearing the anger of their friend had he lost both his race and their bet. He also goes on to describe the women in the crowd, who disapprove of the victor, finding it ridiculous that the victor is so proud of his victory and of the handshaking and baby kissing that comes with it. The narrator ends his description with the unfortunate announcement of overcasting skies, foretelling rain. The story centers around the theme of the consequences and misfortunes that follow a victory, describing how winning does not always bring fortune. = \\"The Street Window\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". The story is also known as \\"The Window on the Street\\" The story is a two sentence long passage written by Kafka. The Narrator of this passage omnisciently takes perspective of life through a window overlooking our character's street. The character is a man who lives a life of solitude, but occasionally wants to have human interaction, and by looking out the window and seeing the people on the street, he fulfills his desire to have human interaction. In the second sentence of the passage, the Narrator discusses the times when the man does not want to look out the window, but the desire (‚Äúthe horses‚Äù) then overwhelms him and in looking out the window, he attains the happiness he desired. The imagery of ‚Äúhorses ... drag[ing] ... him into the train or their wagons ... towards the harmony of man‚Äù show the break of our solitude character's life being ripped through the window he will never cross. = \\"The Wish to Be An Indian\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". The story is also known as \\"Longing to be a Red Indian\\". This story focuses primarily on the subject of social repression in English gentry society. The work is notable for early use of experimental writing techniques, though often considered incomprehensible by literary scholars. = \\"The Trees\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". Humanity is compared to tree trunks in the snow. It appears that with a gentle push we could move them, but we cannot because they are firmly attached to the ground. That too is only apparent. This work uses tree trunks in the snow as a comparison to human beings. They appear to be able to be moved with a gentle push, like humans appear to be able to be moved easily. The tree trunks apparently cannot be moved because they are firmly rooted to the ground, much like humans are rooted to their beliefs and morals and cannot be changed. However, even if trees don't move they are not so firmly rooted, since they eventually fall down ‚Äîjust as humans eventually died. A comics adaptation of the story, illustrated by Peter Kuper, is included in Give It Up!. = \\"Unhappiness\\" = The original German title is \\"\\". The story begins with a confused, chaotic scene inside the narrator's house. Kafka again uses the image of horses waiting outside of a house, as in his short story The Street Window. Suddenly, from a dark corridor within the narrator's own house, an apparition of a child appears. The narrator is not certain whether the child is real, or a ghost. The narrator engages in a dialog with the child. He learns the child already knows him. When the man is overly-formal in his interaction with the child, the child asks \\"I'm just a child; why stand on so much ceremony with me?\\" Ultimately, the conversation is aggravating and intense for the narrator. The child is gone, without having said goodbye, as soon as the narrator turns on a light in his house. The narrator concludes the child was indeed a ghost. The child is part of the narrator's psyche trying to remind him of a natural and youthful childhood he once had, before he became alienated to the world, as a reference to the first story in Contemplation, Children on a Country Road. The narrator meets the girl with skepticism, indicating the narrator is not only alienated from the world, but now alienated from himself as well. Later, the narrator engages in a subsequent dialog with a neighbor on the stairs of his apartment building. After the dialogs with the child apparition and the man on the stairs, the narrator's conclusion is that he feels \\"forlorn\\" and just wants to go to bed.

She is most known as the creator of the Ragsdale conjecture. Early life Ragsdale was born on a farm in Jamestown, North Carolina the third child of John Sinclair Ragsdale and Emily Jane Idol. John was an officer in the Civil War, a teacher in the Flint Hill School, and later a state legislator. Virginia documented her early years in a paper titled \\"Our Early Home and Childhood\\", writing: Study As a junior, Ragsdale entered Salem Academy, and graduated in 1887 as valedictorian with an extra diploma in piano. Ragsdale attended Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina, where she earned her B.S. in 1892. She was active in student life, establishing a Y.M.C.A. on campus, expanding collegiate athletics, and contributing to the formation the Guilford's Alumni Association. Ragsdale was awarded the first scholarship from Bryn Mawr College for the top scholar Guilford College. She studied physics at Bryn Mawr College, obtaining an A.B. degree in 1896. Biography on p.503-505 of the Supplementary Material at AMS She was elected European fellow for the class of 1896, but waited a year before traveling, working as an assistant demonstrator in physics and mathematics graduate student at Bryn Mawr. Together with two of her colleagues (including Emilie Martin), she spent 1897-98 abroad at the University of G√∂ttingen, attending lectures of Felix Klein and David Hilbert. After her return to the United States, she taught in Baltimore for three years until a second scholarship, by the Baltimore Association for the Promotion of University Education of Women, permitted her to return to Bryn Mawr college to complete her Ph.D. under the direction of Charlotte Scott. Her dissertation, \\"On the Arrangement of the Real Branches of Plane Algebraic Curves,\\" was published in 1906 by the American Journal of Mathematics. Her dissertation addressed the 16th of Hilbert's problems, for which Ragsdale formulated a conjecture that provided an upper bound on the number of topological circles of a certain type. Her result is called the Ragsdale conjecture; it was an open problem for 90 years until counterexamples were derived by Oleg Viro (1979) and Ilya Itenberg (1994). Career After completing her degree, Ragsdale taught in New York City and Dr. Sach's School for Girls until 1905. She was head of the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr from 1906‚Äì11, and a reader for Charlotte Scott from 1908‚Äì10. Ragsdale returned to North Carolina in 1911 to accept a mathematics position at Woman's College in Greensboro (now known as the University of North Carolina at Greensboro). She remained there for almost two decades and served as department head from 1926‚Äì1928. She encouraged the school to buy a telescope, and the math department to add statistics to the curriculum. In 1928, she retired from teaching in order to care for her mother's health and help manage the family farm. After the death of her mother in 1934, she built a house at Guilford College, where she spent her last years gardening, working with furniture, working on family genealogy, holding book clubs, and visiting with students. Upon her death, she donated her house to Guilford College, where it housed the faculty, alumni, and visitors. In 1965 President of Guilford Grimsley Hobbs moved into Ragsdale's hous, and it has been the home of the college's president ever since. Trivia *Virginia Ragsdale descended from Godfrey Ragsdale, a settler of the new Jamestown colony. Jamestown was raided by a native-American tribe in 1644 led by the uncle of Pocahontas, during which Godfrey and his wife were killed, but their infant son, Godfrey, Jr., survived. Ragsdale was then descended from the infant.

It spans from Oliver Street in the west (locally called \\"south\\" because it is towards downtown), passing underneath the Manhattan Bridge and on to Grand Street in the east (\\"north\\"). The street is named for Henry Rutgers, a hero of the American Revolutionary War and prominent philanthropist. Rutgers Street, which intersects with Henry Street, is also named for him. The poor condition of immigrants living in squalid tenements on Henry Street and the surrounding neighborhood in the late 19th century prompted nurses Lillian Wald and Mary Maud Brewster to found the Henry Street Settlement in 1893. In recent times, Henry Street continues to be an immigrant neighborhood and has been absorbed into an expanding Chinatown.http://www.nychinatown.org/henry.html In recognition of Henry Street's multicultural history, the Henry Street School for International Studies opened in 2004 at 220 Henry Street.

Biography  Kennedy met photographer Mark Hunter (who goes by the alias \\"The Cobrasnake\\") at a Blood Brothers concert at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California in the summer of 2005. He took some photographs of her for his web site and they exchanged phone numbers. In January 2006 Kennedy began an internship at his office, to fulfill a requirement from her high school for graduation. Hunter's web site featured photos of celebrities at various parties, to which he began bringing Kennedy. Consequently, Hunter and Kennedy began dating with the approval of her parents. In December 2005, Hunter had posted photos of Kennedy with the title \\"JFK CORY KENNEDY\\", which began speculation that she was somehow related to the Kennedy family, which she is not. By April, Hunter claims that he had noticed that every time he posted photos of Kennedy on his site, the web traffic from fashion community sites would spike. Hunter quickly realized that Kennedy had the potential to be a star. That month, as the Kennedy-Levin family visited New York City on vacation, Kennedy and Hunter visited the offices of Nylon magazine, the editor-in-chief of which was a friend of Hunter's. The very next day she was in a photo shoot for an issue focused on music and MySpace, which hit news stands in June. She was mentioned in a New York Times article about interns and LA Weekly's Caroline Ryder did a short article about her. Then in October, she appeared in a mock music video for Good Charlotte's \\"Keep Your Hands Off My Girl\\", directed by Nylon's editor-in-chief Marvin Scott Jarrett. The entire clip is shot from a single camera at a fixed angle, and consists of Kennedy shaking salt and pepper to the beat while eating Indian food and listening to the song on a portable music player. Her parents had known about her exposure online but had not realized the extent to which it had grown until the June issue of Nylon appeared. Because Kennedy had been previously treated for clinical depression, their primary concern had been her health and well-being. By September 2006, her celebrity life began to conflict with her home and school life. Worrying for her education, her parents had her placed in a boarding school, a \\"nonpublic therapeutic placement for kids with various types of learning, behavioral and emotional problems\\" with limited phone and computer use, although she was free to return home on weekends.

In many parts of the world, it was the standard for bedroom and residential hallway ceilings for its bright, white appearance, ability to hide imperfections, and acoustical characteristics. In comparison, kitchen and living room ceilings would normally be finished in smoother skip-trowel or orange peel texture for their higher durability and ease of cleaning. Popcorn ceilings, in pre-1970s and early formulations, often contained white asbestos fibers. When asbestos was banned in ceiling treatments by the Clean Air Act in the United States,http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/ashome.html#example Asbestos in Your Home at EPA.com popcorn ceilings fell out of favor in much of the country. However, in order to minimize economic hardship to suppliers and installers, existing inventories of asbestos-bearing texturing materials were exempt from the ban, so it is possible to find asbestos in popcorn ceilings that were applied through the 1980s. After the ban, popcorn ceiling materials were created using a paper-based or Styrofoam product to create the texture, rather than asbestos. Textured ceilings remain common in residential construction in the United States. Since the mid-2000s, the popularity of textured popcorn ceilings has diminished significantly across North America. A trend toward more modern, clean-lined design features has influenced home improvement professionals to provide popcorn ceiling removal services. Smooth ceilings have many benefits over the textured ceiling, such as their association with a high-end aesthetic, they are more reflective bouncing natural light throughout the room space (especially in combination with high gloss floors), do not harbor dust and allergens (only to be re-introduced into the air), easier patching and touching up after a drywall repair, etc. See also *Artex References Ceilings ","title":"Popcorn ceiling"},{"id":"9728496","text":"Mating Call is a studio album by jazz musician Tadd Dameron with saxophonist John Coltrane, issued in early 1957 on Prestige Records.

Biography A native of Aichi Prefecture, Sugiura graduated from the 46th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1918. He was ranked 81st out of 124 cadets. He served his midshipman duty aboard the cruiser Azuma, and after commissioned as an ensign he was assigned to the battleship Fus≈ç and cruiser Tone. Sugiura returned to school, and became a torpedo and naval artillery expert. As a sub-lieutenant, he served on the Mutsu and the destroyer Kuri, and as lieutenant, he was executive officer and chief navigator on the destroyer Y≈´nagi. After graduation from the Naval War College (Japan) in 1930, he was promoted to lieutenant commander. He was given his first command: the destroyer Tade, on December 1, 1930. He subsequently captained the Uzuki in 1931. He held a number of staff positions through the 1930s, including that of instructor at a number of the naval ordnance schools and was commander of Destroyer Group 5 in 1939. Sugiura was promoted to captain on November 15, 1940, and assigned command of Destroyer Group 17 shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sugiura became commander of Destroyer Group 4 (Hagikaze, flagship, Arashi, Shigure and Kawakaze) on February 20, 1943, and was thus in a central role in the Battle of Vella Gulf from August 6‚Äì7, 1943. On the night of August 6, Sugiura's force carrying 950 troops and supplies for New Georgia was ambushed by US Task Group 31.2 (USS Dunlap, USS Craven, USS Maury, USS Lang, USS Sterett, and USS Stack). All four Japanese destroyers were hit. Hagikaze, Arashi and Kawakaze burst into flames and were quickly sunk by gunfire. The torpedo that hit Shigure was a dud, damaging the rudder only, and she escaped in the darkness. The many Japanese soldiers and sailors left floating in the water after their ships sank refused rescue by the American destroyers. Over 1,000 Japanese troops and sailors were lost. During the battle, Sugiura's flagship destroyer was sunk, but Sugiura survived. Sugiura was later appointed captain of the cruiser Haguro, He was killed on May 16, 1945 when his ship was sunk by Royal Navy warships during the Battle of the Malacca Strait off Penang, Malaysia. He was promoted to vice admiral posthumously. References =Books=  -Firsthand account of the battle by Japanese squadron commander aboard Shigure.

It is a cautionary tale story about a man fall into sinful life when he was given more than he needs. Synopsis The story opens with a peasant preparing to plow a field. Having gone without breakfast, he is careful to hide his dinner, a small crust of bread, under his coat. After plowing the field the peasant is hungry and ready for his dinner, but when he picks up his coat he sees that the bread is gone. It had been taken by a little devil, who was convinced that the peasant would become wrathful. Instead, the peasant decided that whoever took his bread must have needed it more than him, and he went on his way. The little devil is brought before the Chief Devil, who is not pleased that the peasant was not corrupted. He threatens to douse the little devil with holy water if he fails again, and the little devil is sent out for another attempt at corrupting the peasant. The little devil takes the guise of a pilgrim, and in this guise he gives the peasant farming advice throughout the seasons. The peasant grows a great surplus, and he begins to live much better than he had. One season, the little devil convinced the peasant to distill his extra corn into vodka, and the peasant takes his advice. The little devil then brings the Chief Devil to see the result of his works. The devils witness a party hosted by the peasant, where all of the guests and the host himself indulge in several glasses of vodka. They start of joking and jovial, but as they consume more vodka, the party goers become more abusive and irate. When they finally leave the party they are thoroughly drunk, falling over each other and landing in the mud. The Chief Devil is astonished. He is convinced that the drink must have been made from the blood of beasts to make the men act so beastly. The little devil explains that it was simply vodka, and he just needed to convince the peasant to turn God's gift of corn into idle liquor. The little devil knew that all men have a savage side inside of them, and when the peasant had just enough food to survive, the savage beast inside him was kept silent. But as soon as the peasant accumulates a surplus, corruption sets in. Convinced that the corruption of the peasants is complete, the Chief Devil awards the little devil a promotion.

It aired on March 4, 2007. Plot summary Servilia mourns the death of Brutus, killed at Phillipi. She kneels in front of Atia's door chanting repeatedly for justice. Although Atia ignores her initially, the incessant chanting attracts a crowd of pleb onlookers and annoys Atia. After two days, Atia gets fed up with Servilia's obstinacy and throws open the door to let Servilia vent her anger and leave. However, Servilia calls upon the gods to curse Atia for the rest of her life, and then commits suicide, leaving Atia in shock. The trio of Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus discuss the new ruling arrangements over Rome. They decide to divide the Empire into three administrative portions and share all revenue equally. When Posca, upset with Antony over the latter's refusal to share a portion of his bribe money, secretly informs Octavian that Antony is hoarding tribute, the triumvirate comes close to civil war again. Some last minute negotiations preserve its unity, and to strengthen the bond, Atia proposes a marriage between Antony and the House of the Julii‚Äîthus also accomplishing her personal desire to wed Antony. However, Antony and Octavian privately agree that Octavian's sister, Octavia of the Julii, and not Atia, will be wed to Antony, as it is a more acceptable symbol of the political union. A devastated Atia begins to wonder if Servilia's curse has come true, while Agrippa and Octavia exchange distraught glances at the extravagant wedding. The Jewish Prince Herod visits Rome seeking an alliance. Levi regards him as traitor to the people of Judea and convinces Timon that they should kill him at Antony's wedding, even though they know they are certain to lose their own lives in the process. Timon swears an oath on the Torah, but changes his mind at the last minute. He argues that killing Herod will accomplish nothing, and he also has a family to think of. Levi calls him a coward and starts out alone. Timon wrestles him back, and in the ensuing struggle, accidentally stabs his brother dead. Vorena the Elder is seduced by Memmio's man on his orders. Memmio catches them having sex and pretends to be angry with her, saying that he will have to tell Vorena's father and his business friend, Vorenus, about the relationship, which will probably result in severe punishment for Vorena. Vorena begs him to remain silent and he agrees on the condition that Vorena spy on her father and report his actions to Memmio. She agrees willingly, and lies when she is caught in the act by Vorenus. Eirene complains to Pullo of the slave Gaia's constant abuse, laziness and threats towards her. An angry Pullo debates whether to wait for Mascius, away on business, to punish his woman but eventually decides to do it himself. As he confronts Gaia, she tries to seduce him to stop him from beating her in the middle of a violent argument, and Pullo ends up having sex with Gaia. A guilty Pullo promises that it will never happen again, but does not come clean to Eirene, who happily notes that Gaia's behavior has improved since the 'thrashing'. At the end of the episode, Gaia is seen purchasing some abortifacients.

Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Taxonomy The Brazilian tinamou is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Description The Brazilian tinamou is approximately in length. It has reddish-brown upper parts, rufous throat, grey breast, whitish belly, and brown legs. The female has a distinct black barring and is ochraceous on its upper parts. Behavior Like other tinamous, the Brazilian tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2‚Äì3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses.

Davis. After no country decided to challenge Australasia in 1910, only the British Isles and the United States would challenge for the Cup, for the third straight edition. Also for the third straight edition, the Americans would beat the British to earn the right to play for the Cup, and for the third straight edition, the Aussies would beat the Americans for the title. For the first time, however, teams were allowed to use substitute players in dead rubbers, with the United States playing Maurice McLoughlin in singles after Australasia had clinched the final. The final also marked the first time a tie was played in New Zealand, when it was played at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. Anthony Wilding, whose home city was Christchurch, and Australian Norman Brookes won the 1907 tournament for Australasia; the first time that America had been beaten in this tournament. With Wilding being absent in Europe for the 1911 competition, the chances of the Australasian team were weakened. Rain delayed the beginning of the games scheduled for 29 December 1911, and the 1911 Davis Cup event was held between 1 and 3 January 1912. Norman Brookes beat Beals Wright in the opening match. Rodney Heath increased the lead for Australasia by beating William Larned. Australasia retained the Davis Cup through a win in the doubles, with Brookes and Alfred Dunlop being successful over Wright and McLoughlin. The fourth match was defaulted by Wright, and Larned stepped aside to give the younger McLoughlin the opportunity to play Brookes.

It is a road, train and air transport hub in eastern Germany. Local and commuter transport services grant accessibility in the Dresden agglomeration. The city has a dense network of tram and bus lines. Dresden has two major train stations, an international airport and an inner harbour on the Elbe river waterway. Autobahns grant access to all cardinal directions. Dresden is the junction of two class-A European routes. Dresden is also an international centre of traffic and transport science. Road Bundesautobahn 17 crossing the Wei√üeritz valley in southern Dresden The Bundesautobahn 4 (European route E40) crosses Dresden in the northwest. Along the A4 motorway, Dresden has five exits. The A4 connects Dresden with Chemnitz and Frankfurt, and the A14 connects Leipzig and Hanover. The Bundesautobahn 17 leaves the A4 at the three-junction interchange \\"Dresden-West\\" in a south-eastern direction. In Dresden it begins to cross the Ore Mountains towards Prague and provides three exits in the southern parts of Dresden. The Bundesautobahn 13 leaves from the three-point interchange \\"Dresden-Nord\\" and goes to Berlin. The A13 and the A17 are on the European route E55. Bundesstra√üe roads crossing or running through Dresden are: * Bundesstra√üe 6 (Cuxhaven - G√∂rlitz at the border to Poland) * Bundesstra√üe 97 (Dresden - Guben at the border to Poland) * Bundesstra√üe 170 (Dresden - Zinnwald-Georgenfeld at the border to the Czech Republic) * Bundesstra√üe 172 (Dresden - Bad Schandau at the border to the Czech Republic) * Bundesstra√üe 173 (Dresden - Bamberg) Automated parking garage Railway The network of the Dresden S-Bahn There are two main inter-city transit hubs in the railway network in Dresden: Dresden Hauptbahnhof is the largest station in the city granting access to the network to the southern parts include the Altstadt. Dresden-Neustadt railway station is located to the north of the river Elbe. The most important railway lines run to Berlin, Prague, Leipzig and Chemnitz. A commuter train system (Dresden S-Bahn) operates on three lines alongside the long-distance routes. Other stations in Dresden include: Dresden-Friedrichstadt, Dresden Mitte, Dresden Airport and Dresden Industriegel√§nde. Airport Dresden Airport is the international airport of Dresden, located at the north-western outskirts of the town in the district of Klotzsche. After German reunification the airport's infrastructure has been considerably improved. In 1998, a motorway access route was opened. In March 2001, a new terminal building was opened along with the underground S-Bahn station Dresden Flughafen, a multi-storey car park and a new aircraft handling ramp. The only runway of the airport was extended to 2,800 metre. Most of the scheduled flights are domestic flights for example to Munich, Frankfurt or D√ºsseldorf while there are also some daily international lines to Vienna, Zurich and London Heathrow. The airport hosts the EADS Elbe Flugzeugwerke which is the EADS-centre of reverting Airbus passenger planes to freighter planes. The Elbe Flugzeugwerke are the largest plant of aircraft industry in eastern Germany. Public local transport The longest trams in Dresden set a record in length Light rail/tramway network of Dresden Dresden has a large tramway network that is operated by the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe (DVB). The origins of the Dresden tramway can be traced back to the year 1872, when the first horse-drawn line opened between the city centre and the former village of Blasewitz, now a borough of Dresden. The tramway system is the backbone of public transport in Dresden. DVB operate twelve routes on a 200 km network.Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe: Profile On the major lines through the inner city, where different routes intertwine, vehicles run up to every two minutes. Different routes can be identified by a route number scheme, which also extends to local and regional bus services, as well as a colour code which has by now only been applied to the official network diagram of DVB. On all tramway routes, a general 10-minute headway is offered on weekdays, extending to 15 minutes on Saturday, Sunday and in the evening. The system boasts a daily 24 hour service. The fleet is being renewed to replace the ageing Czech Tatra trams. Today many of the low floor vehicles are up to 45 metres long and manufactured by Bombardier Transportation in Bautzen. The newest trams are vehicles of the Flexity Classic XXL series that are adjusted to the topography of Dresden.Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe: NGTD12DD data sheet The Dresden tramway is a mixed system of traditional street running, especially in the inner city boroughs close to the city centre, and modern light rail. While many tracks in the system are on separated roadbeds (often with grass grown around them to avoid noise) some tracks are still placed on the streets in the midst of individual traffic. Contrary to many other German cities of comparable size, no tunnel sections exist. A Mercedes-Benz Citaro bus of Dresden transportation, bound for L√∂btau S√ºd CarGoTram In recent years, street running has been replaced by independent right-of-way arrangements wherever possible. Many stations are now fully accessible to physically disabled people, in compliance with the purchase of low floor rolling stock. The CarGoTram is a tram that supplies Volkswagen's Transparent Factory, crossing the city. The two trams, up to 60 meters long, are the longest vehicles allowed to use roads in Dresden. The connection by tram was established to reduce the number of trucks used. The transparent factory is located not far from the city centre next to the city's largest park.Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe: CarGoTram  Transport science  = History = Dresden has a long tradition in transport and traffic science dating back to the 19th century. Scientists of the city's colleges and technical institutes build up one of the world's most densest transport network by designing vessels such as the Saxonia locomotive, facilities such as the G√∂ltzsch Viaduct and security devices. The early success in the rail network was named as a nationwide pattern by Friedrich List's work √úber ein s√§chsisches Eisenbahn-System als Grundlage eines allgemeinen deutschen Eisenbahn-Systems (A Saxon rail system as a basement of a general German rail system) in 1833. A faculty of traffic and circulation sciences at the Technische Hochschule was founded in 1949 and transformed into an independent University of Transport and Communications in 1952 (Hochschule f√ºr Verkehrswesen). The institute is part of the Technische Universit√§t Dresden again since 1992, retransformed into the faculty of traffic and transport sciences. There is also the Fraunhofer Institute for Transportation and Infrastructure Systems close to the faculty's activities in research and development. Until today the faculty is unique among German university faculties, although there are some universities offering akin courses (for example at the Technical University of Berlin at the faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Transport Systems). The faculty is closely interlocked to the faculties of mechanical engineering and economics as like as to the faculty of electrical engineering and information technology. =Current topics= * The AutoTram (a partially automated multi-articulated, guided bus)AutoTram developed at Fraunhofer IVI * Electronic ticketing (tested in the Dresden mass transportation) * Traffic censoring and status screening * Intermodal traffic information systems * Transport in shrinking cities and demographic effects on traffic * High-speed rail in south-east Europe especially alongside the Pan-European corridor IV * Traffic effects on environment * Optimising of traffic efficiency and network resources * Mobility behaviour and traffic psychologyTraffic and transportation psychology in Dresden * Traffic accident researchTraffic Accident Research Project  References  External links *Homepage of the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe, the public transport provider *Network maps of the public transport system Transport in Dresden ","title":"Transportation in Dresden"},{"id":"9728610","title":"Bazaar (1982 film)"},{"id":"9728619","title":"Doi Lo District"},{"id":"9728631","text":"The Practice is an American legal drama created by David E.

All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Description The grey-legged tinamou is approximately in length. It is dark brown above with finely barred black on its lower back, it is rufous below, has tinged grey on its upper breast, the sides of its belly are banded buff, its head and neck are rufous, its throat white, and its legs are greyish. The female is darker on her lower back with narrow light buff barring. Behavior Like other tinamous, the grey-legged tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2‚Äì3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range and habitat It is found in dry shrubland up to altitude. It may also be found in moist or drier lowland forest. This species is native to east central Colombia, southern Venezuela, and northwestern Brazil. It may also be found in far eastern Peru.BirdLife International (2008) Conservation In 2012 the IUCN classifies this Tinamou as Near Threatened, with an occurrence range of .

It may include a process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output. In commercial and industrial real estate, an energy audit is the first step in identifying opportunities to reduce energy expense and carbon footprint. Principle When the object of study is an occupied building then reducing energy consumption while maintaining or improving human comfort, health and safety are of primary concern. Beyond simply identifying the sources of energy use, an energy audit seeks to prioritize the energy uses according to the greatest to least cost effective opportunities for energy savings. Home energy audit A home energy audit is a service where the energy efficiency of a house is evaluated by a person using professional equipment (such as blower doors and infrared cameras), with the aim to suggest the best ways to improve energy efficiency in heating and cooling the house. An energy audit of a home may involve recording various characteristics of the building envelope including the walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and skylights. For each of these components the area and resistance to heat flow (R-value) is measured or estimated. The leakage rate or infiltration of air through the building envelope is of concern, both of which are strongly affected by window construction and quality of door seals such as weatherstripping. The goal of this exercise is to quantify the building's overall thermal performance. The audit may also assess the efficiency, physical condition, and programming of mechanical systems such as the heating, ventilation, air conditioning equipment, and thermostat. A home energy audit may include a written report estimating energy use given local climate criteria, thermostat settings, roof overhang, and solar orientation. This could show energy use for a given time period, say a year, and the impact of any suggested improvements per year. The accuracy of energy estimates are greatly improved when the homeowner's billing history is available showing the quantities of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, or other energy sources consumed over a one or two-year period. Some of the greatest effects on energy use are user behavior, climate, and age of the home. An energy audit may therefore include an interview of the homeowners to understand their patterns of use over time. The energy billing history from the local utility company can be calibrated using heating degree day and cooling degree day data obtained from recent, local weather data in combination with the thermal energy model of the building. Advances in computer-based thermal modeling can take into account many variables affecting energy use. A home energy audit is often used to identify cost effective ways to improve the comfort and efficiency of buildings. In addition, homes may qualify for energy efficiency grants from central government. Recently, the improvement of smartphone technology has enabled homeowners to perform relatively sophisticated energy audits of their own homes. This technique has been identified as a method to accelerate energy efficiency improvements. =In the United States= In the United States, this kind of service can often be facilitated by: * Public utility companies, or their energy conservation department. * Independent, private-sector companies such as energy services company, insulation contractor, or air sealing specialist. * (US) State energy office. Utility companies may provide this service, as well as loans and other incentives. Some public utilities offer energy audits as part of a coordinated service to plan or install home energy upgrades. Utilities may also provide incentives to switch, for example, if you are an oil customer considering switching to natural gas. Where to look for insulation recommendations: * Local building inspector's office. * Local or state building codes. * US Department of Energy. * Your local Builders Association Residential energy auditors are accredited by the Building Performance Institute (BPI) or the Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET). There are also some simplified tools available, with which a homeowner can quickly assess energy improvement potential. Often these are supplied for free by state agencies or local utilities, who produce a report with estimates of usage by device/area (since they have usage information already). Examples include the Energy Trust of Oregon program and the Seattle Home Resource Profile. Such programs may also include free compact fluorescent lights. A simple do-it-yourself home energy audit can be performed without using any specialized tools. With an attentive and planned assessment, a homeowner can spot many problems that cause energy losses and make decisions about possible energy efficiency upgrades. During a home energy audit it is important to have a checklist of areas that were inspected as well as problems identified. Once the audit is completed, a plan for suggested actions needs to be developed. New York City In New York City, local laws such as Local Law 87 require buildings larger than to have an energy audit once every ten years, as assigned by its parcel number. Energy auditors must be certified to perform this work, although there is no oversight to enforce the rule. Because Local Law 87 requires a licensed Professional Engineer to oversee the work, choosing a well-established engineering firm is the safest route. These laws are the results of New York City's PlaNYC to reduce energy used by buildings, which is the greatest source of pollution in New York City. Some engineering firms provide free energy audits for facilities committed to implementing the energy saving measures found. =In Lebanon= Since 2002, The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) initiated a nationwide program on energy audits for medium and large consuming facilities. By the end of 2008, LCEC has financed and supervised more than 100 audits. LCEC launched an energy audit program to assist Lebanese energy consuming tertiary and public buildings and industrial plants in the management of their energy through this program. The long-term objective of LCEC is to create a market for ESCOs, whereby any beneficiary can contact directly a specialized ESCO to conduct an energy audit, implement energy conservation measures and monitor energy saving program according to a standardized energy performance contract. Currently, LCEC is helping in the funding of the energy audit study and thus is linking both the beneficiary and the energy audit firm. LCEC also targets the creation of a special fund used for the implementation of the energy conservation measures resulting from the study. LCEC set a minimum standard for the ESCOs qualifications in Lebanon and published a list of qualified ESCOs on its website. Industrial energy audits Increasingly in the last several decades, industrial energy audits have exploded as the demand to lower increasingly expensive energy costs and move towards a sustainable future have made energy audits greatly important. Their importance is magnified since energy spending is a major expense to industrial companies (energy spending accounts for ~ 10% of the average manufacturer's expenses). This growing trend should only continue as energy costs continue to rise. While the overall concept is similar to a home or residential energy audit, industrial energy audits require a different skillset. Weatherproofing and insulating a house are the main focus of residential energy audits. For industrial applications, it is the HVAC, lighting, and production equipment that use the most energy, and hence are the primary focus of energy audits. Types of energy audit The term energy audit is commonly used to describe a broad spectrum of energy studies ranging from a quick walk-through of a facility to identify major problem areas to a comprehensive analysis of the implications of alternative energy efficiency measures sufficient to satisfy the financial criteria of sophisticated investors. Numerous audit procedures have been developed for non-residential (tertiary) buildings (ASHRAE; IEA-EBC Annex 11; Krarti, 2000). Audit is required to identify the most efficient and cost-effective Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs) or Measures (ECMs). Energy conservation opportunities (or measures) can consist in more efficient use or of partial or global replacement of the existing installation. When looking to the existing audit methodologies developed in IEA EBC Annex 11, by ASHRAE and by Krarti (2000), it appears that the main issues of an audit process are: * The analysis of building and utility data, including study of the installed equipment and analysis of energy bills; * The survey of the real operating conditions; * The understanding of the building behaviour and of the interactions with weather, occupancy and operating schedules; * The selection and the evaluation of energy conservation measures; * The estimation of energy saving potential; * The identification of customer concerns and needs. Common types/levels of energy audits are distinguished below, although the actual tasks performed and level of effort may vary with the consultant providing services under these broad headings. The only way to ensure that a proposed audit will meet your specific needs is to spell out those requirements in a detailed scope of work. Taking the time to prepare a formal solicitation will also assure the building owner of receiving competitive and comparable proposals. Generally, four levels of analysis can be outlined (ASHRAE): * Level 0 ‚Äì Benchmarking: This first analysis consists in a preliminary Whole Building Energy Use (WBEU) analysis based on the analysis of the historic utility use and costs and the comparison of the performances of the buildings to those of similar buildings. This benchmarking of the studied installation allows determining if further analysis is required; * Level I ‚Äì Walk-through audit: Preliminary analysis made to assess building energy efficiency to identify not only simple and low-cost improvements but also a list of energy conservation measures (ECMs, or energy conservation opportunities, ECOs) to orient the future detailed audit. This inspection is based on visual verifications, study of installed equipment and operating data and detailed analysis of recorded energy consumption collected during the benchmarking phase; * Level II ‚Äì Detailed/General energy audit: Based on the results of the pre-audit, this type of energy audit consists in energy use survey in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the studied installation, a more detailed analysis of the facility, a breakdown of the energy use and a first quantitative evaluation of the ECOs/ECMs selected to correct the defects or improve the existing installation. This level of analysis can involve advanced on-site measurements and sophisticated computer-based simulation tools to evaluate precisely the selected energy retrofits; * Level III ‚Äì Investment- Grade audit: Detailed Analysis of Capital-Intensive Modifications focusing on potential costly ECOs requiring rigorous engineering study. =Benchmarking= The impossibility of describing all possible situations that might be encountered during an audit means that it is necessary to find a way of describing what constitutes good, average and bad energy performance across a range of situations. The aim of benchmarking is to answer this question. Benchmarking mainly consists in comparing the measured consumption with reference consumption of other similar buildings or generated by simulation tools to identify excessive or unacceptable running costs. As mentioned before, benchmarking is also necessary to identify buildings presenting interesting energy saving potential. An important issue in benchmarking is the use of performance indexes to characterize the building. These indexes can be: * Comfort indexes, comparing the actual comfort conditions to the comfort requirements; * Energy indexes, consisting in energy demands divided by heated/conditioned area, allowing comparison with reference values of the indexes coming from regulation or similar buildings; * Energy demands, directly compared to ‚Äúreference‚Äù energy demands generated by means of simulation tools. Typically, benchmarks are established based on the energy outlets (loads) within the building and are then further parsed into \\"base loads\\" and \\"weather sensitive loads\\". These are established through a simple regression analysis of energy consumption and demand (if metered) correlated to weather (temperature and degree - day) data during the period for which utility data is available. Aggregate base loads will represent as the intercept of this regression and the slope will typically represent the combination of building envelope conduction and infiltration losses less losses or gains from the base loads themselves. For example, while lighting is typically a base load, the heat generated from that lighting must be subtracted from the weather sensitive cooling load derived from the slope to gain an accurate picture of the true contribution of the building envelope on cooling energy use and demand. =Walk-through (or) preliminary audit= The preliminary audit (alternatively called a simple audit, screening audit or walk-through audit) is the simplest and quickest type of audit. It involves minimal interviews with site-operating personnel, a brief review of facility utility bills and other operating data, and a walk-through of the facility to become familiar with the building operation and to identify any glaring areas of energy waste or inefficiency. Typically, only major problem areas will be covered during this type of audit. Corrective measures are briefly described, and quick estimates of implementation cost, potential operating cost savings, and simple payback periods are provided. A list of energy conservation measures (ECMs, or energy conservation opportunities, ECOs) requiring further consideration is also provided. This level of detail, while not sufficient for reaching a final decision on implementing proposed measure, is adequate to prioritize energy-efficiency projects and to determine the need for a more detailed audit. =General audit= The general audit (alternatively called a mini-audit, site energy audit or detailed energy audit or complete site energy audit) expands on the preliminary audit described above by collecting more detailed information about facility operation and by performing a more detailed evaluation of energy conservation measures. Utility bills are collected for a 12- to 36-month period to allow the auditor to evaluate the facility's energy demand rate structures and energy usage profiles. If interval meter data is available, the detailed energy profiles that such data makes possible will typically be analyzed for signs of energy waste. Additional metering of specific energy-consuming systems is often performed to supplement utility data. In-depth interviews with facility operating personnel are conducted to provide a better understanding of major energy consuming systems and to gain insight into short- and longer-term energy consumption patterns. This type of audit will be able to identify all energy-conservation measures appropriate for the facility, given its operating parameters. A detailed financial analysis is performed for each measure based on detailed implementation cost estimates, site-specific operating cost savings, and the customer's investment criteria. Sufficient detail is provided to justify project implementation. The evolution of cloud-based energy auditing software platforms is enabling the managers of commercial buildings to collaborate with general and specialty trades contractors in performing general and energy system-specific audits. The benefit of software-enabled collaboration is the ability to identify the full range of energy efficiency options that may be applicable to the specific building under study with \\"live time\\" cost and benefit estimates supplied by local contractors. =Investment-grade audit= In most corporate settings, upgrades to a facility's energy infrastructure must compete for capital funding with non-energy-related investments. Both energy and non-energy investments are rated on a single set of financial criteria that generally stress the expected return on investment (ROI). The projected operating savings from the implementation of energy projects must be developed such that they provide a high level of confidence. In fact, investors often demand guaranteed savings. The investment-grade audit expands on the detailed audit described above and relies on a complete engineering study in order to detail technical and economical issues necessary to justify the investment related to the transformations. Simulation-based energy audit procedure for non-residential buildings A complete audit procedure, very similar to the ones proposed by ASHRAE and Krarti (2000), has been proposed in the frame of the AUDITAC and HARMONAC projects to help in the implementation of the EPB (‚ÄúEnergy Performance of Buildings‚Äù) directive in Europe and to fit to the current European market. The following procedure proposes to make an intensive use of modern BES tools at each step of the audit process, from benchmarking to detailed audit and financial study: * Benchmarking stage: While normalization is required to allow comparison between data recorded on the studied installation and reference values deduced from case studies or statistics. The use of simulation models, to perform a code-compliant simulation of the installation under study, allows to assess directly the studied installation, without any normalization needed. Indeed, applying a simulation-based benchmarking tool allows an individual normalization and allows avoiding size and climate normalization. * Preliminary audit stage: Global monthly consumptions are generally insufficient to allow an accurate understanding of the building's behaviour. Even if the analysis of the energy bills does not allow identifying with accuracy the different energy consumers present in the facility, the consumption records can be used to calibrate building and system simulation models. To assess the existing system and to simulate correctly the building's thermal behaviour, the simulation model has to be calibrated on the studied installation. The iterations needed to perform the calibration of the model can also be fully integrated in the audit process and help in identifying required measurements and critical issues. * Detailed audit stage: At this stage, on-site measurements, sub-metering and monitoring data are used to refine the calibration of the BES tool. Extensive attention is given to understanding not only the operating characteristics of all energy consuming systems, but also situations that cause load profile variations on short and longer term bases (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, annual). When the calibration criteria is satisfied, the savings related to the selected ECOs/ECMs can be quantified. * Investment-grade audit stage: At this stage, the results provided by the calibrated BES tool can be used to assess the selected ECOs/ECMs and orient the detailed engineering study. Specific audit techniques =Infrared thermography audit= The advent of high-resolution thermography has enabled inspectors to identify potential issues within the building envelope by taking a thermal image of the various surfaces of a building. For purposes of an energy audit, the thermographer will analyze the patterns within the surface temperatures to identify heat transfer through convection, radiation, or conduction. It is important to note that the thermography only identifies surface temperatures, and analysis must be applied to determine the reasons for the patterns within the surface temperatures. Thermal analysis of a home generally costs between 300 and 600 dollars. For those who cannot afford a thermal inspection, it is possible to get a general feel for the heat loss with a non-contact infrared thermometer and several sheets of reflective insulation. The method involves measuring the temperatures on the inside surfaces of several exterior walls to establish baseline temperatures. After this, reflective barrier insulation is taped securely to the walls in by strips and the temperatures are measured in the center of the insulated areas at 1-hour intervals for 12 hours (the reflective barrier is pulled away from the wall to measure the temperature in the center of the area which it has covered). The best manner in which to do this is when the temperature differential (Delta T) between the inside and outside of the structure is at least 40 degrees. A well-insulated wall will commonly change approximately 1 degree per hour if the difference between external and internal temperatures is an average of 40 degrees. A poorly insulated wall can drop as much as 10 degrees in an hour. =Pollution audits= With increases in carbon dioxide emissions or other greenhouse gases, pollution audits are now a prominent factor in most energy audits. Implementing energy efficient technologies help prevent utility generated pollution. Online pollution and emission calculators can help approximate the emissions of other prominent air pollutants in addition to carbon dioxide. Pollution audits generally take electricity and heating fuel consumption numbers over a two-year period and provide approximations for carbon dioxide, VOCs, nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, cadmium, lead, mercury compounds, cadmium compounds and lead compounds. History Energy audits initially became popular in response to the energy crisis of 1973 and later years. Interest in energy audits has recently increased as a result of growing understanding of human impact upon global warming and climate change. Energy audits are also popular due to financial incentives for homeowners.

Social-liberal and social-democratic, the party's ideology lately tilted toward Christian democracy. The party's last leader was Claudio Lavoyer, a long-time regional councillor and former regional minister. History The party was founded in 1998 by the merger of the Progressive Democratic Autonomists, which included several splinters of the Italian Republican Party, and the Autonomist People's Alliance, basically formed by former members of the Italian Socialist Party. In the 1998 regional election the party list, which also included some members of the Christian Democratic Centre and the United Christian Democrats, obtained 9.7% of the vote and four regional councillors. In the 2001 the FA was merged with the Autonomists into Edelweiss (SA). In the 2003 regional election SA was the second-largest party with 19.8% of the vote, but the party soon split and the FA re-gained its autonomy in 2004.

The battle took place on June 26, 1777, at Scotch Plains and Metuchen, New Jersey, during the American Revolutionary War. Despite the name, no fighting occurred in modern-day Short Hills, a section of Millburn. In mid-June General Howe marched most of his army into central New Jersey in an attempt to lure George Washington's Continental Army to a place where it might be better attacked than its defensive position in the Watchung Mountains. When Washington refused to abandon his position Howe returned to Amboy on June 22\\\\. Washington's forward divisions, including that of Lord Stirling, shadowed this British movement, and Washington moved his main army out of the hills. Howe seized this opportunity, and on June 26 marched two columns of troops out in an attempt to cut Washington off from the high ground. These troops skirmished with Lord Stirling's troops, and eventually engaged in a pitched battle in Scotch Plains. Stirling's outnumbered force retreated, but Washington, alerted to the British movement, had by then retreated back into the hills. Background In March 1776 the British forces of Lieutenant General William Howe withdrew from Boston after Major General George Washington fortified high ground threatening the city and its harbor. With this army augmented by reinforcements from Europe, General Howe captured New York City, forcing Washington to retreat all the way across New Jersey. At the end of 1776, Washington crossed the Delaware River and defeated Hessian forces at the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, and eventually regained control of most of New Jersey. The two armies then settled into winter quarters, and engaged in a war of skirmishes during the winter months of early 1777.C. Ward, pp. 203‚Äì324 General Howe spent the winter planning a campaign to capture the seat of the rebel Congress, Philadelphia. The constant skirmishing throughout the winter had taken its toll on his troops stationed in New Jersey, and even a major attack on the Continental Army outpost at Bound Brook in April had not been entirely successful.McGuire, pp. 17‚Äì23 Howe apparently did not divulge his plans or his intended route to Philadelphia to many people,McGuire, p. 32 and General Washington did not know what his intentions were, although Philadelphia was one target he suspected Howe was interested in. On May 29, Washington moved most of his army from its winter quarters near Morristown to a strong position at Middlebrook in the Watchung Mountains from which he could observe and interfere with British moves toward Philadelphia.C. Ward, p. 325Lundin, p. 314 Historians who mention this battle only occasionally give it a name. It is often called \\"Short Hills\\", even though the battle took place primarily in present-day Edison and Scotch Plains, New Jersey. Historians also give the battle other names; David Martin calls it \\"Flat Hills\\" or \\"Metuchen Meeting House\\"; one British regimental history refers to it by \\"Westfield\\".Duncan, p. 256 Prelude On June 9, Howe began moving troops from Staten Island to Perth Amboy. On June 11, almost his entire army moved up the roads along the Raritan River to New Brunswick. Washington's intelligence reports indicated that Howe had left behind equipment needed for crossing the Delaware River and was unlikely to be heading for Philadelphia;C. Ward, p. 326 Washington, as a precautionary measure, called out the militia in southern New Jersey.Lundin, p. 315 On June 14, Howe's army marched again, its destination Somerset Court House (present-day Millstone). Apparently seeking to draw Washington into battle on open terrain, Howe remained there five days. Washington refused to move out of the hills, and on June 19, Howe began the march back to Perth Amboy, which he reached on June 22, having completely evacuated New Brunswick.Lundin, pp. 316‚Äì320 Brigadier General William Alexander, engraving from Harper's Encyclopedia, 1905 After refusing to fall for Howe's trap, Washington followed the retreating British, bringing his army down from Middlebrook to Quibbletown, and sent a strong forward detachment under Brigadier General William Alexander (aka \\"Lord Stirling\\") to the Scotch Plains area north of New Brunswick, to cover his left flank and to harass the British. Stirling's command, numbering about 2,500, comprised William Maxwell's New Jersey brigade, Thomas Conway's Pennsylvania brigade, Daniel Morgan's Corps of Riflemen and Ottendorf's Corps.H. Ward, p. 62 Maxwell's brigade consisted of the 1st through 4th New Jersey Continentals and Oliver Spencer's Additional Regiment, while Conway's consisted of the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th Pennsylvania Continentals.H. Ward, p. 61 Ottendorf's Corps, although it was named for its principal recruiter, a German mercenary named Nicholas Dietrich, Baron de Ottendorf, was commanded by Charles Armand, a French soldier of fortune who was given its command in May 1777 after Ottendorf abruptly left the army.Cecere, p. 96 Howe took advantage of Washington's movement, and launched a sudden attack against Lord Stirling's position, meant to devastate Stirling's forces, cut off Washington's retreat back to Middlebrook, and engage the Americans in a pitched battle on relatively open terrain.C. Ward, p. 327 At 1:00 am on the morning on June 26 Howe marched two columns of troops out of Perth Amboy. The first column, under the command of Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis, consisted of several companies of Hessian j√§gers, three battalions of Hessian grenadiers and one British, mounted Hessian chasseurs and some British dragoons from the 16th Light Dragoons, a battalion from the Brigade of Guards, and the Loyalist provincial unit of Queen's Rangers.Barber and Howe, p. 315 The second column was under the command of Major General John Vaughan and accompanied by General Howe. It consisted of j√§ger companies from Hesse-Kassel and Ansbach-Bayreuth, and battalions of British light infantry and grenadiers.Ewald, p. 69It was British army practice at the time to combine light infantry and grenadier companies from an army's regiments into brigades separate from the infantry of the regiment; because of this, detailed regimental identifications are not possible for some of the units involved in this action. (C. Ward, p. 26) The battle Detail of a 1777 map of the area. The battle took place at points between \\"Metuchin\\" and Westfield\\". The column of General Cornwallis marched for Woodbridge, while Vaughan's marched toward Bonhamton. As the two columns moved on roughly parallel paths through the Short Hills area, they came into contact with Stirling's guards, and a running skirmish began, with the Americans firing on the British from the underbrush as they fell back.Lundin, p. 323 The retreating Americans led both of the armies into the Ash Swamp and Scotch Plains areas,McGuire, p. 53 where Stirling prepared a defensive position. Severe cannon fire and strength of British numbers forced Stirling, as determined as he was to stand against them, to retreat even further back, toward Westfield. There the British, suffering under the extreme heat of the day, ended the pursuit, and Stirling was able to fall back in good order toward the post at Middlebrook. A messenger had alerted Washington to Howe's proximity, prompting Washington to precipitately withdraw to a more secure position further in the hills. Later in the day, Howe arrived to inspect Washington's lines and adjudged them too strong to attack. Because Stirling's resistance may have provided Washington with enough time to manage his withdrawal to more secure ground, the battle is considered a strategic victory for the Americans. The British, after spending the night at Westfield, returned to their post at Perth Amboy, and completely evacuated New Jersey by June 30. In mid-July, Howe embarked much of his army on transports, and sailed off toward Philadelphia, destination unknown to Washington.Martin, pp. 28‚Äì30 A local tale arose in Westfield about an encounter between General Cornwallis and \\"Aunt Betty\\" Frazee, a local resident who had been baking bread for the Americans. When Cornwallis arrived, he requested a loaf of bread from her. When she offered it to him, saying \\"I give this not in love but in fear\\", Cornwallis graciously declined the offer, responding \\"Not a man of my command shall touch a single loaf.\\"Ricord, p. 513 Casualties Lieutenant General William Howe, commander of the British army A British officer recorded the British and Hessian casualties as 5 killed and 30 wounded. The only officer casualty was Captain The Honourable John Finch of the Guards Light Infantry. He had been to the forefront of the attack and, at one point, called out to Lord Stirling, \\"Come here, you damned rebel, and I will do for you!\\" Stirling's response was to instruct four marksmen to concentrate their fire upon the captain.McGuire, p. 54 Finch soon received a wound, from which he died three days later.McGuire, p. 56 The American casualties are not fully known; the British claimed the Americans suffered 100 killed and wounded, and both sides acknowledged the American loss of three cannons, and the capture of 70 men.C. Ward, p. 327 Ottendorf's Corps, who had formed Stirling's advance guardMcGuire, p. 55 appear to have been hardest hit: out of 80 men, 32 were killed or captured. Colonel Israel Shreve, commander of the 2nd New Jersey Regiment wrote on July 6, 1777 that Maxwell's Brigade \\"had 12 killed and about 20 wounded and as many taken prisoners ... \\"; he also noted in his journal, \\"We had between 20 & 30 Wounded ... mostly slightly Except 3 or 4 ...\\" Two officers are recorded as having been lost in the 2nd New Jersey: Captain Ephraim Anderson, killed, and Captain James Lawrie, captured. Legacy An area of the battlefield, encompassing about in Edison Township, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

He won critical acclaim for 800 Two Lap Runners. Film critic and researcher Alexander Jacoby has described Hiroki as \\"one of the modern Japanese cinema's most intelligent students of character\\". Biography =Pink film= Hiroki is one of several Japanese film directors who got their start in the Japanese softcore pornographic film genre of pink film. He said in an interview that in the late 1970s when he wanted to get into directing, he wrote a script for a pink film and brought it to the ≈åkura Eiga studio but they told him he needed to start as an assistant director. At this time he met prolific pink film director Genji Nakamura and during the next three years, Hiroki worked as an assistant director, editor, and manager for Nakamura's company Y≈´ Pro. Hiroki made his first film as a director with Sexual Abuse! Exposed Woman for Million Film in 1982. His debut met with poor reviews and was \\"terrible\\" according to Hiroki and he went back to being an assistant director for a time.Sharp, p. 242-243, 344 Hiroki's next excursion into directing, beginning in November 1983, was more successful, a trio of homoerotic pink films for ENK, a new company with links to Nikkatsu, which specialized in gay pink film. Our Season, Our Generation and Our Moment were frank depictions of the tribulations of gay couples in 1980s Japan. All three films starred veteran pink film actor T≈çru Nakane and Our Season, considered the best of the trio by the pink film historians Thomas and Yuko Weisser, had a screenplay by future director Rokur≈ç Mochizuki. The Weissers dub Hiroki \\"the prince of youth porn\\" for his 1984 film produced by Y≈´ Pro and distributed by Nikkatsu, Teacher, Don't Turn Me On!, once again scripted by Rokur≈ç Mochizuki and featuring T≈çru Nakane as the college-age tutor of a high-school girl.Weisser, p. 428-429 His most notorious works for Nakamura's Y≈´ Pro were a series of brutal S&M; movies directed under the pseudonym G≈ç Ij≈´in (), which was also sometimes used by scriptwriter Hitoshi Ishikawa and Nakamura himself. According to Hiroki, using a pseudonym gave him greater freedom to describe S&M; relationships in a new way. The G≈ç Ij≈´in films directed by Hiroki were the 1984 The SM, distributed by Million Film, The Sexual Abuse from February 1985 and The Sacrifice from February 1986, with the latter two films being released by Nikkatsu.Weisser, p. 358, 383-385 Also in 1986, Nikkatsu released Hiroki's creative but bizarrely titled Y≈´ Pro production SM Class: Accidental Urination promoted as \\"New wave S&M; with a sense of humor\\".Weisser, p. 396 In October 1987, Hiroki directed pioneering AV Idol Hitomi Kobayashi in the pink film The True Self of Hitomi Kobayashi released by Million Film and the next year supervised another early AV actress Eri Kikuchi in Eri Kikuchi: Huge Breasts released by Nikkatsu in January 1988. Hiroki also ventured into the adult video (AV) world, directing for Athena Eizou, a company founded by former pink film director Tadashi Yoyogi, with titles such as the August 1989 starring Mako Hyuga and the May 1990 video . =Into mainstream film= Although Hiroki left the pink film industry in the late 1980s, he continued to make films dealing with sexuality. Hiroki has said that he never changed his film making, but his later movies were aimed at a different audience.Sharp, p. 207, 243 In May 1989 Hiroki with fellow directors Masato Ishioka and Tadafumi Tomioka founded their own production company Heaven (). In November 1990, Hiroki directed a romance about modern young couples in Japan, A Love Affair With Sawako for the Shochiku company. This was followed by the erotic horror V-cinema production Sadistic City which took the Japanese Film Section Grand Prize for a video at the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival. Hiroki's breakthrough into mainstream film, however, came with his 1994 feature 800 Two Lap Runners which looked at teenage heterosexual and homosexual relationships against a track and field background. The film opened at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 1994 before being released in Japan in July 1994. It placed number 7 on the Kinema Junpo's list of the ten best Japanese movies of 1994. Hiroki returned to his theme of the emotional and sexual lives of young adults in modern urban Japan in his June 1996 film Midori about a high-school girl pretending to be ill in order to see her boyfriend. His 2000 work Tokyo Trash Baby is an understated look at a lonely woman who goes through the garbage of the neighbor she is obsessed with looking for mementos. His other film in 2000 had a very different theme; the erotic comic drama I Am an S&M; Writer, with a screenplay by Hiroki's former pink film colleague Hitoshi Ishikawa, is based on a possibly partly autobiographical novel by celebrated S&M; writer Oniroku Dan. =Recognition= Hiroki's 2003 film Vibrator, based on the novel by Mari Akasaka and starring Nao Omori and Shinobu Terajima, returned to his theme of alienated women. It was described by Tom Mes as \\"one of the bravest and most important films of recent years.\\" Vibrator won the Best Film award at the 25th Yokohama Film Festival in 2004 and Hiroki was named Best Director. The film was also widely seen overseas. where it won a number of awards giving Hiroki a measure of international renown. He once again worked with actress Shinobu Terajima on the 2005 film It's Only Talk, returning to his concentration on the problems of modern city life in Japan. The film won Best Film Third Place at the 16th Japanese Professional Movie Awards (2006) and Hiroki was given a Special Award. Also during this period, Hiroki directed two character dramas with sexual themes, L'Amant about a teenaged girl selling herself as a sex slave and M, detailing the experiences of a housewife whose sexual experimentation leads to prostitution. Later films include The Egoists, a romance film starring Kengo Kora and Anne Suzuki and River, a film which was originally inspired by the Akihabara massacre. His ensemble drama film, Kabukicho Love Hotel, screened at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Style and influences Hiroki was described by Niels Matthijs of Twitch Film as \\"one of the few male directors who can portray a woman with lifelike depth.\\" Filmography =Feature films= * (1982) * (1983) * (1983) * (1984) * The SM (1984) as G≈ç Ij≈´in * (1985) * (1985) as G≈ç Ij≈´in * (1986) as G≈ç Ij≈´in * (1986) * (1987) * (1988) * (1989) * (1990) * (1993) (V-cinema) * (1994) * 800 Two Lap Runners (1994) * (1995) * (1995) * (1996) * (1999) * (2000) * (2000) * (2001) * (2002) * Vibrator (2003) * The Silent Big Man (2004) * (2004) * (2004) * Female (2005) * It's Only Talk (2005) * (2006) * (2006) * M (2006) * (2007) * (2008) * (2008) * April Bride (2009) * (2010) * (2011) * River (2011) * (2013) * Kiiroi Zou (2013) * (2013) * Kabukicho Love Hotel (2014) * Otoko no Issh≈ç (2014) * (2015) * Policeman and Me (2017) * (2017) * Miracles of the Namiya General Store (2017) * Marmalade Boy (2018) * (2018) =Short films= * Cops vs Cops (2003) References External links 1954 births Living people Japanese film directors Japanese film editors Pink film directors Japanese pornographic film directors ","title":"Ry≈´ichi Hiroki"},{"id":"9728776","title":"Aosta Valley (political coalition)"},{"id":"9728780","text":"Ianuaria is a Celtic goddess revered at the Burgundian sanctuary of Beire-le- chatel, a spring shrine at which images of Apollo, triple-horned bulls and doves were also dedicated.

It has now been reborn as CASA and is the basis of the image processing systems for several next-generation radio telescopes including ALMA, eVLA, and ASKAP. Early history In 1988-89, the Director of National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), Paul Vanden Bout, convened an independent review panel, the Software Advisory Group (SWAG) to produce recommendations for the future of processing software for NRAO. SWAG was chaired by Tim Cornwell, and its members included Geoff Croes, Gareth Hunt, Jan Noordam, and Ray Norris. SWAG recommendations were that: * All data processing in NRAO should be coordinated by a new Assistant Director for Computing * AIPS should be re-designed and re- implemented following certain general guidelines * An equal amount of attention should be devoted to single-dish software. In late 1990 the NRAO Director accepted the recommendations, and the task of defining the new package began. The project was originally an effort by several astronomical institutes together in a consortium, the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF), the Jodrell Bank Observatory (JBO) and the MERLIN/VLBI National Facility (MERLIN/VLBI), the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy ASTRON. Features AIPS++ provides facilities for calibration, editing, image formation, image enhancement, and analysis of images and other astronomical data. A major focus is on reduction of data from both single-dish and aperture synthesis radio telescopes. Although the tools provided in AIPS++ are mainly designed for processing data from varieties of radio telescopes, the package is expected to also be useful for processing other types of astronomical data and images. However, the reduction of most data from imaging array detectors is performed using IRAF instead. AIPS++ is structured as a library of tools at the lower levels, designed to replace AIPS of more monolithic applications. In general, the counterpart of an AIPS task is an AIPS++ tool function, although the toolkit structure of AIPS++ will generally mean that these functions are more fine-grained, except for the more integrated tools at the higher levels (such as map). The counterparts of AIPS adverbs are the parameters of AIPS++tool functions. The command-line interpreter in AIPS is POPS, while the counterpart in AIPS++ is Glish. The code used as standard in most astronomical institutes is still AIPS, as AIPS++ is usually not yet considered sufficiently reliable and usable. Like most research astronomy software, it is available for all major operating systems except Microsoft Windows. AIPS++/CASA On August 25, 2004 the AIPS++ code base was re-organized to a more modular structure; since then it is referred to as CASA (\\"Common Astronomy Software Applications\\"). CASA consists of a suite of C++ libraries derived from the original AIPS++ tasks. The Glish scripting system is being replaced by Python bindings, a system known as \\"CASApy\\". The CASA software is no longer developed by the consortium, but mainly within NRAO for use on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. The core of the old AIPS++ libraries, now known as CasaCore are still being maintained and developed by the original consortium members. A separate Python interface is available known as python-casacore (formerly \\"Pyrap\\"). Python-casacore is mainly developed within ATNF and ASTRON for replacing Glish for the Australia Telescope Compact Array, WSRT and LOFAR. CASA also uses these core libraries but not python-casacore.

Developed predominantly for use with the then under-construction VLA, the generality inherent in its design allowed it to become the standard data- reduction package for most radio interferometers, including VLBI. Limited single-dish capability is also featured. Although partially replaced by CASA, it continues to evolve and remains widely used. History Development of AIPS started at NRAO in 1978, two years before the VLA became fully operational. Originally written in FORTRAN 66, AIPS has used FORTRAN 77 since 1989. The very first AIPS installation was on a MODCOMP computer, but the package's portability has led to it being installed on many different systems. Pre-compiled versions are today available for users of Linux and Mac OS. Since 2018, a pre-compiled version is no longer available for Solaris and users must now build AIPS from source. Over the years, the capabilities of AIPS have greatly expanded. Initial usage was focused on the VLA, but it has gone on to be used to reduce data from practically all radio interferometers, including MERLIN and the GMRT and, to a lesser extent, the WSRT and ATCA. The ability to calibrate VLBI data (including space VLBI) was added in the 1990s, primarily to support operations with the VLBA, but in the process becoming the main data-reduction package for the EVN and combined VLBA/EVN observations (Global VLBI). Single-dish support was also added in the 1980s, with particular application to NRAO's 12-m radio telescope and the 91-m transit telescope. AIPS has now been in use for nearly 40 years and has even outlived its supposed replacement AIPS++, which was eventually rebranded as CASA. CASA has gone on to be the main data-reduction package for the upgraded VLA (EVLA) and ALMA, but AIPS remains able, to a large degree, to process data from these state-of-the-art instruments. Despite its age and limited resources, AIPS remains widely used and under active development. AIPS is free software and is covered by the terms of the GNU General Public License. Description AIPS runs under the X Window System with commands entered interactively using a command-line interpreter called POPS. Although relatively primitive, this gives access to a useful collection of e.g. mathematical functions, logical operators and flow control statements. Commands can also be placed in a text file which makes repeating complicated procedures much more convenient and which can be used to create data-reduction pipelines. A more modern alternative is to install ParselTongue, a Python-based interface. As well as the terminal window from which AIPS is started and commands entered, most AIPS sessions will by default contain two other windows, the AIPS TV and the Message Server. The TV is used to visualise data or images and can, for example, be used to interactively edit data or control the progress of a deconvolution. The Message Server displays useful information reported by each task. Optionally, basic black and white plots can be displayed using TEKSRV, a Tektronix 4012-based graphics terminal. Before any data can be processed by AIPS, they must first be imported into the system's own data areas, usually in FITS format. The FITS standard was agreed in 1979 and its development is inseparable from that of AIPS. The data can henceforth be processed using a large number (>530) of individual programs, each of which performs a specific task e.g. producing an image from a calibrated data set. Together these allow a user to visualize, edit and calibrate a data set and subsequently make images or fit models. A number of analysis tasks are included (e.g. Gaussian fitting to images or spectra) as well as the possibility to make publication- quality plots. Extensive help is available to AIPS users, with detailed information on each parameter and task viewable from the command line. There is also a user guide, the AIPS Cookbook, which is built around examples (recipes) of how to run the various tasks. It is available on-line, as well as being packaged with AIPS in PDF and PostScript formats. A newsletter (AIPSLetter) is published biannually. Primatology Although briefly known as RANCID, the eventual choice of name has led to a preponderance of primate- based humour in and around AIPS. The Cookbook contains \\"additional recipes\\", instructions for preparing food and drink which all feature bananas as an ingredient. The programmer's guide is called Going AIPS, the cover of which features a gorilla clutching a Tektronix 4012 graphics terminal whilst standing upon two IBM 3420 Magnetic Tape Units. Various cover designs of the Cookbook and icons also include images of primates.

It is located southeast of Ware and about north of London. Great Amwell is also the name of the civil parish within East Hertfordshire district. The Anglican church is dedicated to St John the Baptist. The East India College was founded here in 1806, for the education of young men intended for the civil service of the East India Company in India. It is now a public school, Haileybury College. The New River runs through the village. On a hill above the church is an ancient mound, the remains of a fortification; and to the west, on the road to Hertford, is a large tumulus. Great Amwell has been the residence of some celebrated literary characters, among whom are: * Izaak Walton, (1593‚Äì1683) the noted angler. * John Scott of Amwell, (1730‚Äì83), author of several poems and tracts, who built a grotto containing several apartments, which still exists. * John Hoole, (1727‚Äì1803), the distinguished translator of Tasso, and biographer of John Scott of Amwell. * Rev Robert Scott Mylne FRSE FSSA FSA (1854-1920) antiquarian, vicar of Amwell (buried in the Mylne vault there) Others buried in Amwell include: * William Warner, (1558?-1609), the poet and historian; * Alexander Small (1710-1794) Scottish surgeon and frequent correspondent of Benjamin Franklin; * Harold Abrahams in 1978, the Olympian who was depicted in Chariots of Fire. Richard Warren (d. 1628), a passenger on the Mayflower in 1620, who settled in Plymouth Colony and co-signed the Mayflower Compact, was married on 14 April 1610 at Great Amwell to Elizabeth Walker, daughter of Augustine Walker. Richard and Elizabeth are the ancestors of two U.S. Presidents, Ulysses S. Grant and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. A hamlet called Amwell also exists a mile south west of Wheathampstead, also in Hertfordshire.

The members were Otto Bezloja (bass guitar, leader), Radim Hlad√≠k (lead guitar), Jan \\"Farmer\\" Obermayer (organ), Miroslav \\"Tony Black\\" Schwarz (drums) as well as Karel Kahovec (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Vladim√≠r Mi≈°√≠k (vocals, bluesharp). The latter two were replaced in late 1966 by ex-Flamengo Viktor Sodoma jr. (vocals). The Matadors formed in early 1965 from Fontana (The Fontanas), with members from Pra-Be and Komety (The Comets). Fontana's manager (and until early 1965 also their drummer) Wilfried Jelinek secured a promotional deal with an East German manufacturer of sound equipment and music instruments. Since the group began to use an electronic organ named Matador, they changed their name accordingly to promote it. The Matadors performed exclusively in East Germany until April 1966, their live repertoire consisted mostly of cover versions from popular beat groups like The Who, The Kinks or The Small Faces. The most successful Matadors line-up broke up in summer 1968. Radim Hlad√≠k then established Blue Effect (later also known as Modr√Ω Efekt or M Efekt) with the original Matadors lead singer Vladim√≠r Mi≈°√≠k. Jan Obermayer joined Petr Nov√°k's George & Beatovens. Viktor Sodoma jr. pursued a solo career as a pop singer, backed by various groups and orchestras. Best remembered was his 1971-1973 collaboration with Shut Up, later known as the Franti≈°ek Ringo ƒåech Group, with whom he recorded numerous \\"bubble-gum\\" singles and one side of his only solo album. Otto Bezloja and Tony Black briefly reformed the Matadors, joined by ex-Komety lead singer Milo≈° \\"Reddy\\" Vokurka, Ji≈ô√≠ Matou≈°ek on organ and Petr Netopil on guitar. In fall 1968 they left to Munich, West Germany where they worked as the house band of a German edition of the Hair musical. In the early 1970s the nucleus of that band evolved to the Germany-based progressive rock group Emergency. The Matadors reunited in 1991 and made rare public appearances until 2008.

The book was announced on February 20, 2007 on the author's official website.Confessor at Terry Goodkind's official website. The book was released November 13, 2007. Plot summary Richard Rahl has been captured by an Imperial Order commander, who spared his life (under the guise of Ruben Rybnik) to be the point man for the commander's Ja'La dh Jin team. Kahlan is also Jagang's prisoner, surrounded by special guards who can see her. During Richard's imprisonment, he is warned by a cloaked specter that he is now a player of the Boxes of Orden. Sister Ulicia is also visited by this figure, and is told that the time to open the Boxes has been reset to one year from the first day of winter-the day that Nicci set the Boxes into motion under Richard's name. Rachel is discovered missing from the Keep. That night, the witch woman Six enters the Keep and steals the third box of Orden from Nicci and Zedd. Zedd discovers the Keep's warning that the Wizard's Keep is dying due to the contamination of the chimes, and places a spell to protect it from future damage. Zedd, Rikka, and Tom then head to Tamarang to remove the spell blocking Richard's gift. In an attempt to breach the People's Palace, Jagang orders a massive ramp built to reach the plateau, bypassing the natural defenses of the Palace. While excavating dirt for the ramp in the Azrith Plains, Jagang's diggers stumbled upon the catacombs under the People's Palace, which provide a secret entryway. Three Sisters of the Dark enter, killing Ann and capturing Nicci, while soldiers are sent into the catacombs to prepare an attack. The Sisters of the Dark discover what they believe to be the original Book of Counted Shadows in Bandakar. Richard, after realizing that Jagang and the Sisters with him would recognize him during team inspections and throughout the tournament, disguises himself by covering the faces and bodies of his teammates and himself with intimidating symbols and parts of spell-forms. His team defeats Jagang's team in the tournament final, but Jagang refuses to accept his team's loss and invalidates the win twice, leading to a riot in the camp, during which Richard and Nicci escape, while Kahlan is 'rescued' by Samuel. Richard and Nicci, with Adie's help, enters the Palace through the catacombs, where Cara and Nathan help them wipe out the Order forces hiding there. Rachel is lured to Tamarang by Violet, who has drawn a spell around her that sets 'ghostie gobblies' to destroy her. Along the way, she is given a piece of chalk by Shota, disguised as Rachel's mother, and uses this to transfer the spell to Violet. Rachel then restores Richard's gift. Shota reappears as Rachel's mother and sends her to deliver a message with Gratch to the Mud People. On the way to Tamarang, Zedd, Rikka, and Tom are captured by Six, who is in league with Jagang and has helped attack D'Haran forces in the Old World. Richard is warned by Nicci that he must not reveal his love for Kahlan to her, lest Kahlan's lost memories alone fail to be restored, much like Richard, in the first book of the series, could not be told before finding the way to intimately love a Confessor while being untouched by her power. Richard is taught many spells and spell-forms by Nicci regarding the Boxes of Orden. He tests his knowledge by helping priestess Jillian, who was brought to the Azrith Plains after Jagang's men hunted her down in Caska, give the Order's army terrible nightmares. Jagang is given particularly nasty dreams, mostly involving Nicci. After a demand for surrender by Jagang, Richard then sends himself to the Underworld, using Denna as a spirit guide, and retrieves everyone's memories of Kahlan. Unfortunately, he is attacked by the pursuing beast earlier sent against him. He destroys the beast and escapes by releasing Additive Magic into the Underworld, whence he is physically projected into a gathering of the Mud People. He is greeted by Chase and Rachel, who, with Gratch's help, had told the Mud People to hold a gathering to await him. At the Palace, Nathan assumes Richard is dead and, acting on Richard's instructions, accepts Jagang's terms of surrender, which include surrendering Nicci to Jagang and giving the Order's Sisters access to the Garden of Life in order to open the boxes. Samuel attempts to rape Kahlan; during the struggle, she touches the Sword of Truth, which restores her knowledge, but not her memories, of being a Confessor and releases her power to take control of him. Samuel reveals he is an agent for Six, and that Richard and Kahlan were once married. He then dies when she refuses to forgive his attempt against her. Richard meets Kahlan on the way to Tamarang, but refuses to answer her questions about their marriage, for fear of contaminating the spell upon her. He gives her Spirit in compensation. Six has imprisoned Zedd, Tom, and Rikka, and appears as Richard and Kahlan arrive in Tamarang. As Six is about to recapture them, Shota appears as Six's mother. She kills Six and then Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd fly back to the People's Palace on the red dragon Six had enslaved; now revealed to be Scarlet's son Gregory, whom Richard saved as an egg. At the Palace, Richard allows Jagang and his Sisters of the Dark to open the boxes of Orden. During the ritual, Jagang goes to retrieve Nicci from the dungeon. However, Nicci locks a Rada'Han around Jagang's neck, rendering him powerless. After taking him back to the Garden of Life, she eventually kills him unceremoniously to prevent his martyrdom. In the Garden of Life, the Sisters of the Dark discover the correct box and open it; however, they find a flaw in their success. Richard explains that all of the Books of Counted Shadows were false keys to the boxes; whereas if they had the true key, they would still fail by reason of malicious intent. Immediately, the Sisters are drawn into the Underworld. Richard explains that the true key to the Magic of Orden is the Sword of Truth. Kahlan tells Richard she loves him, revealing that her emotions have contaminated her chances of regaining memory. Richard uses the Sword to reveal the correct box and then to capture its magic. Now in command of life and death, he uses the magic to send the followers of the Order to a new world, devoid of magic; his half-sister Jennsen, her compatriots the Bandakar, and her suitor Tom decides to relocate to the new world. He also uses Orden to repair the damage caused by the chimes, and to send Chainfire to the new world he has created, ensuring the complete removal of magic from that world, and removing all its inhabitants' memories of their previous world. As Richard goes to close the opening between worlds, he fears Kahlan is lost to him; she, however, replies that she was protected from this loss because she had fallen in love with him on her own, much as he had with her from the beginning. An epilogue shows Tom and Jennsen expecting a child, who will carry the Rahl name, and shows the immigrants gradually forgetting Richard and everything from their previous world. The book ends with the marriage of Cara and General Meiffert. It is revealed that the Sisters of the Light have moved into the Wizard's Keep, where along with Zedd, they can continue to teach young wizards. Chase (now a Warden of the Keep) and his family have also moved into the Keep, as have Adie and Friedrich, who are now a mated pair. Under Zedd's questions, Richard admits taking Panis Rahl's spell from red fruit, so that it is no longer poison, and to bringing back the Temple of the Winds to the world of the living. After Cara and Benjamin's wedding, the devotion bells begin to ring. Richard prevents the people from kneeling, proclaiming that they are no longer his subjects.

Author Terry Goodkind had the following to say: \\"When Keith and I were working on cover concepts for Chainfire he came up with a number of color roughs that, because of their simple, iconic nature were very close to being final. At the time I recognized three of these roughs as perfect for the Chainfire Trilogy. That means that the final book of the series had already been done by him before he passed away so that is the cover that will appear on the book.\\" Wizard's Eleventh Rule The eleventh and final rule that appears in The Sword of Truth series is revealed in Confessor to be an unwritten rule. The reason is explained through the character Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander: Richard goes through great struggle to obtain a book left for him by Baraccus, a great wizard from the past. The book entitled Secrets to a War Wizard's power is a means for him to understand how to use his gift and therefore is in essence the solution to major problems. When he obtains the book, its pages are blank and Zedd informs him that Baraccus left it blank to illustrate the meaning of the phrase \\"rule unwritten\\". Using this knowledge Richard reasons that the Book of Counted Shadows could not be the key to the boxes of Orden, and that the Sword of Truth was the only way to harness Orden's power. As far as the knowledge within the book was concerned, there was \\"nothing in it\\", much like Richard's Secrets to a War Wizard's Power. The Sword of Truth, representative of its namesake, was key to life. The secret to Richard's power is that he seeks the truth. In seeking truth he turns a blind eye to corrupt ideas and embraces the essence of life itself. The Sisters of the Dark assumed the truth to be what they had always been told by others and never thought to verify it themselves, and died for it; but would never have been able to access the power by reason of acting in hate. Richard, on the other hand, intended to use the power to help those he cared about and thus had the ability to harness the power.

Formerly governed by the IT8 Committee, IT8 activities were merged with those of the Committee for Graphics Arts Technologies Standards (CGATS) in 1994. Standards list The following is a list of the IT8 standards, according to the NPES Standards Blue Book: =IT8.6 - 2002 - Graphic technology - Prepress digital data exchange - Diecutting data (DDES3)= This standard establishes a data exchange format to enable transfer of numerical control information between diecutting systems and electronic prepress systems. The information will typically consist of numerical control information used in the manufacture of dies. 37 pp. =IT8.7/1 - 1993 (R2003) - Graphic technology - Color transmission target for input scanner calibration= This standard defines an input test target that will allow any color input scanner to be calibrated with any film dye set used to create the target. It is intended to address the color transparency products that are generally used for input to the preparatory process for printing and publishing. This standard defines the layout and colorimetric values of a target that can be manufactured on any positive color transparency film and that is intended for use in the calibration of a photographic film/scanner combination. 32 pp. =IT8.7/2 - 1993 (R2003) Graphic technology - Color reflection target for input scanner calibration= This standard defines an input test target that will allow any color input scanner to be calibrated with any film dye set used to create the target. It is intended to address the color photographic paper products that are generally used for input to the preparatory process for printing and publishing. It defines the layout and colorimetric values of the target that can be manufactured on any color photographic paper and is intended for use in the calibration of a photographic paper/scanner combination. 29 pp. =IT8.7/3 - 1993 (R2003) Graphic technology - Input data for characterization of 4-color process printing= The purpose of this standard is to specify an input data file, a measurement procedure and an output data format to characterize any four-color printing process. The output data (characterization) file should be transferred with any four-color (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) halftone image files to enable a color transformation to be undertaken when required. 29 pp. Targets This is an IT8 color target made in EGM Laboratories in Barcelona, Spain. It has a very big gamut, slightly bigger than ProPhoto RGB color space. Calibrating all devices involved in the process chain (original, scanner/digital camera, monitor/printer) is required for an authentic color reproduction, because their actual color spaces differ device-specifically from the reference color spaces. An IT8 calibration is done with what are called IT8 targets, which are defined by the IT8 standards. ;Example Special targets, implementing the IT8.7/1 (transparent target) or IT8.7/2 (reflective target) standards, are needed for calibrating scanners. These targets consists of 24 grey fields and 264 color fields in 22 columns: * Column 01 to 12: HCL color model, which differ in Hue, Chroma, and Lightness * Column 13 to 16: CMYK-Colors Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black) in different steps of brightness * Column 17 to 19: RGB-Colors Red, Green, and Blue in different steps of brightness * Column 20 to 22: undefined, producers' choice After scanning such a target, an ICC profile gets calculated on the basis of reference values.

Since retiring as a player, he has worked as a goalkeeping coach. Playing career Thomson started his professional career at Dundee United. He made his first team debut on 2 May 1987 in a 2‚Äì1 victory at Tannadice against Hibernian, but went on to play just five other first team games for the club before being loaned out to Barnsley. He signed for Forfar Athletic in 1991 before joining Raith Rovers in 1993. During his time at Stark's Park, Thomson played in over 100 first team games, winning the Scottish Football League First Division and Scottish League Cup. Thomson famously saved the decisive penalty kick from Paul McStay in the 1994 Scottish League Cup Final. Thomson had been sent off in the semi-final against Airdrieonians; substitute Brian Potter saved a penalty that allowed Raith to progress to the final. Thomson played a key role as Raith set up a lucrative UEFA Cup tie against Bayern Munich. Thomson went on to have spells at Hull City, then a loan spell from the English club at Motherwell, before joining Airdrieonians in 1998. Thomson finished his career playing at Dunfermline Athletic, where he played alongside Scott M. Thomson (as had briefly been the case at Raith), although part of his final season was at Brechin City on loan. Coaching Thomson was given his first coaching job at Dunfermline Athletic while still technically registered as a player. At East End Park Thomson forged a special bond with striker Craig Brewster and goalkeeper Derek Stillie and later joined them both at Tannadice when the striker was appointed player- manager of Dundee United. Thomson remained as goalkeeping coach under Craig Levein after the departure of Brewster and Stillie. Thomson was released from his contract in May 2009 after Levein stated his intention to appoint an experienced player who could also coach, rather than a specialist coach like Thomson. Thomson was then hired by Hibernian to serve as their goalkeeping coach, replacing Gordon Marshall. Thomson departed Hibernian in the summer of 2014 and subsequently joined Ross County.Thomson joins Ross County, SPFL Personal life He is the father of current Raith Rovers goalkeeper Robbie Thomson.

Home- Start works with people who have parenting experience to support local parents. Home-Start schemes have been established in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Republic of Ireland, Israel, Kenya, Lithuania, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Uganda and the United Kingdom. Each national Home-Start scheme or association will support families with at least one child under five. History The original Home-Start programme was set up in Leicester, UK in 1973 by Margaret Harrison. John Bowlby describes it as a \\"home-visiting scheme which offers support, friendship, and practical assistance to young families experiencing difficulties. It is staffed by volunteers who work in close liaison with the related statuary services and who also receive support and guidance from a professional. All visits are by invitation of the family and on their own terms. There are no contracts and no time limits\\". He says \\"Often visiting is started whilst a mother is still pregnant. Most of those visited are young, impulsive, and dreadfully isolated and have never experienced affection, care, or security. In such cases the principal role of the volunteer is to mother the mother and so, by example, to encourage her to mother her own child. She will also talk and play with the children, again providing the mother with an example she has never had.\\" An evaluation of the pioneer project surveyed a random sample of one in five of 288 families visited and on a 3-point scale (no change, some change, considerable change) 85% of the families surveyed claimed considerable change and only two believed there was no change. The health visitors were almost as enthusiastic and even half of the volunteers claimed considerable change. It is not considered suitable in cases of chronic mental illness, serious degenerative illness, recidivism or people intent on children being admitted to care. It became a national organisation in 1981 with 9 branches (now over 300) and Home Start International was founded in 1998. It now has branches in 22 countries on 5 continents. Margaret Harrison's account \\"Hooray! Here Comes Tuesday: The Home-start Story\\" was published by Bamaha Publishing in 2003 and she was appointed a CBE in recognition of her work for the community. Organization Home-Start International is a non- profit organisation constituted as a charity in the UK (UK charity number 1076991). Around the world, Home-Start supports families through local schemes, recruiting volunteers and staff locally. Many schemes are run as independent charities or non-profit organisations, with their own independent management committees or boards. The majority of schemes are also part of a national association, which is itself generally an independent charity or non- profit organisation. Governance structures vary from country to country, but all Home-Start national associations have professional staff and a management committee or board. Funding Home-Start International is largely funded by philanthropic trusts and foundations and by corporate partners. In 2007-08 major funders include The Oak Foundation, The Stavros Niarchos Foundation and The Vodafone Group Foundation.

It is associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and was first described in 1966. It is sometimes referred to as a neuroendocrine disorder, although the condition's relationship to the endocrine system is widely disputed. It is recognized as a rare disease by the NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center. Up to 2005, almost 200 case reports of this disease were published. Between 1990 and 2000, 43 cases were published. Since that time, research has expanded and numerous cases are being reported by scientists around the world, suggesting that this rare condition is likely to have been significantly undiagnosed in the past. Over 100 scientific articles on Hashimoto's encephalopathy were published between 2000 and 2013. Signs and symptoms The onset of symptoms tends to be fairly gradual and to occur over 1-12 months. Symptoms of Hashimoto's encephalopathy may include: * Personality changes * Aggression * Delusional behavior * Concentration and memory problems * Coma * Disorientation * Headaches * Jerks in the muscles (myoclonus ‚Äì 65% of cases) * Lack of coordination (ataxia ‚Äì 65% of cases) * Partial paralysis on the right side * Psychosis * Seizures (60% of cases) * Sleep abnormalities (55% of cases) * Speech problems (transient aphasia ‚Äì 80% ofcases) * Status epilepticus (20% of cases) * Tremors (80% of cases) Pathogenesis The mechanism of pathogenesis is not known, but is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, similar to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, as its name suggests. Consistent with this hypothesis, autoantibodies to alpha- enolase have been found to be associated with Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Since enolase is the penultimate step in glycolysis, if it were inhibited (for example by being bound by autoantibodies), one would expect decreased energy production by each cell, leading to resulting atrophy of the affected organ. This would occur most likely through each cell shrinking in size in response to the energy deficit (and/or in extreme situations from some cells dying via either apoptosis or necrosis, depending on location).Shigeomi Shimizu2, Yutaka Eguchi, Wataru Kamiike, Yuko Itoh, Jun-ichi Hasegawa, Kazuo Yamabe, Yoshinori Otsuki, Hikaru Matsuda, and Yoshihide Tsujimoto The First Department of Surgery.

Japan. url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/56/9/2161.full.pdf This may occur as a result of enough ATP not being available to maintain cellular functions - notably, failure of the Na/K ATPase, resulting in a loss of the gradient to drive the Na/Ca antiporter, which normally keeps out of cells so it does not build to toxic levels that will rupture cell lysosomes leading to apoptosis. An additional feature of a low-energy state is failure to maintain axonal transport via dynein/kinesin ATPases, which in many diseases results in neuronal injury to both the brain and/or periphery.Ihejirika DF. PASS Program Course Notes: USMLE Preparation. Lulu.com; 2014. =Pathology= Very little is known about the pathology of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Post mortem studies of some individuals have shown lymphocytic vasculitis of venules and veins in the brain stem and a diffuse gliosis involving gray matter more than white matter. As mentioned above, autoantibodies to alpha-enolase associated with Hashimoto's encephalopathy have thus far been the most hypothesized mechanism of injury. Diagnosis =Laboratory and radiological findings= * Increased liver enzyme levels (55% cases) * Increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (55% cases) * Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (25% cases) Cerebrospinal fluid findings: * Raised protein (25% cases) * Negative for 14‚Äì3‚Äì3 protein * May contain antithyroid antibodies * Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities consistent with encephalopathy (26% f cases) * Single photon emission computed tomography shows focal and global hypoperfusion (75% of cases) * Cerebral angiography is normal Thyroid hormone abnormalities are common (>80% of cases): * Subclinical hypothyroidism (35% of cases) * Overt hypothyroidism (20% of cases) * Hyperthyroidism (5% of cases) * Euthyroid on levothyroxine (10% of cases) * Euthyroid not on levothyroxine (20% of cases) Thyroid antibodies ‚Äì both antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO, antithyroid microsomal antibodies, anti-M) and antithyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg) ‚Äì in the disease are elevated, but their levels do not correlate with the severity. Electroencephalogram studies, while almost always abnormal (98% of cases), are usually not diagnostic. The most common findings are diffuse or generalized slowing or frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity. Prominent triphasic waves, focal slowing, epileptiform abnormalities, and photoparoxysmal and photomyogenic responses may be seen. =Definition= A relapsing encephalopathy occurs in association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, with high titers of antithyroid antibodies. Clinically, the condition may present one or more symptoms. Onset is often gradual and may go unnoticed by the patient and close associates to the patients. Symptoms sometimes resolve themselves within days to weeks, leaving a patient undiagnosed. For many other patients, the condition may result in ongoing problems with a variety of manifestations, often confusing clinicians due to the diffuse nature of symptoms. =Differential diagnosis= * Alzheimer's disease * Cerebrovascular accidents (stroke) * Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease * Epilepsy * Migraine (including basilar, hemiplegic, and retinal types) * Other forms of autoimmune encephalitis, including forms of limbic encephalitis such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis * Schizophrenia * Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak * Viral encephalitis * Transient ischemic attack Treatment Because most patients respond to corticosteroids or immunosuppressant treatment, this condition is now also referred to as steroid-responsive encephalopathy. Initial treatment is usually with oral prednisone (50‚Äì150 mg/day) or high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day) for 3‚Äì7 days. Thyroid hormone treatment is also included if required. Failure of some patients to respond to this first-line treatment has produced a variety of alternative treatments, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, chloroquine, methotrexate, periodic intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange. No controlled trials have been conducted, so the optimal treatment is not known. Seizures, if present, are controlled with typical antiepileptic agents. Prognosis Duration of treatment is usually between 2 and 25 years. Earlier reports suggested that 90% of cases stay in remission after discontinuation of treatment, but this is at odds with more recent studies, which suggest that relapse commonly occurs after initial high-dose steroid treatment. Left untreated, this condition can result in coma and death. Epidemiology The prevalence has been estimated to be 2.1/100,000 with a male-to-female ratio of 1:4. The mean age of onset is 44 with 20% of cases presenting before the age of 18 years. Most reported cases occur during the patient's fifth decade of life. History The first case of HE was described by Brain et al. in 1966.

History =Zambia Airways (1964‚Äì1967)= On 1 January 1964, a reconstitution of Central African Airways (CAA) as the national airline of Southern Rhodesia, Zambia and Malawi led to the creation of three new national carriers, all of them wholly owned subsidiaries of CAA. Each of these airlines were relative autonomous but relied upon CAA's technical, managerial and financial assistance. Zambia Airways was established in April 1964. T. M. D. Mtine and R. P. Hartley were appointed as Zambia Airways' first chairman and general manager, respectively. Two Douglas DC-3s and three de Havilland DHC-2 Beavers three were transferred from CAA. The Beavers were intended to operate on domestic services under the premise that the revenue generated by these services would stay with the airline. On the other hand, the DC-3s would operate transborder flights. Operations started on 1 July 1964 serving the Salisbury‚ÄìKariba‚ÄìLusaka‚ÄìNdola‚ÄìKitwe run. In November the same year, the Ndola‚ÄìElisabethville service, previously flown by CAA, was launched on a weekly basis. The domestic routes were generally unprofitable and they were supported by the profits generated with CAA's international operations. In 1967, Alitalia was selected to run the airline after Zambia Airways's splitting from CAA later that year. Pan African Air Services and Flying Tiger Line also participated as bidders for the management contract. In July, a new airport was inaugurated in Lusaka. The same year, CAA was dissolved within months, and CAA's former subsidiary Zambia Airways became the state-owned national airline on 1 September 1967. =Zambia Airways Corporation (1967‚Äì1994)= On 1 September 1967, following the Zambia Airways Act, which appointed the carrier to operate both domestically and internationally after the collapse of CAA, Zambia Airways Corporation was formed in order to take over Zambia Airways, the former CAA's subsidiary. Technical and management assistance was provided by Alitalia. The first general manager was Franceso Casale. Two BAC One-Eleven 400s that were originally ordered by CAA were delivered late in the year. Operations started on 1 January 1968 using BAC One-Eleven 400 aircraft and serving Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Zaire on the Lusaka‚ÄìNdola‚ÄìNairobi, which also called at Kinshasa, Blantyre, and Livingstone. A Douglas DC-8-43, on wet-lease from Alitalia, permitted the carrier to start, in November 1968, a service from Lusaka to London with intermediate stops at Nairobi and Rome. The introduction of this route doubled the length of Zambia Airways' network to . Mauritius was first served in November 1969. A Zambia Airways Boeing 737-200 Advanced at Harare International Airport in 1992. This particular aircraft, 9J-AEG, was delivered new to the airline in 1976. February 1970 saw the upgauge of frequencies to London, with a second flight operated along the Lusaka‚ÄìNairobi‚ÄìLondon run. Two HS-748s and a Douglas DC-8-43 from Alitalia were added to the fleet. The HS-748 came to replace four DC-3s the company had deployed on domestic routes. A charter subsidiary named National Air Charter Zambia (NACZ) was formed in 1974; operations began in March the same year using a leased Canadair CL-44. Also in 1974, the first Boeing 707-320C joined the fleet. Two more Boeing 707s were purchased from Aer Lingus and Pan Am in early 1975. Another Boeing 707-320C was acquired from the Aer Lingus on 24 March 1975. By this time, the contract with Alitalia was cancelled and a similar one was signed with Aer Lingus. The introduction of the Boeing 707 enabled the airline to launch direct services from Lusaka to London and Frankfurt in April 1975 and July 1976, respectively. By late 1976, the DC-8s were replaced with Boeing 707s. In early 1975, the two BAC One-Eleven 200s were sold to Dan-Air. Prior to ordering a Boeing 737-200 Advanced directly from the aircraft manufacturer in June 1975, a Boeing 737 had been wet-leased from Aer Lingus. The ordered 737 was intended as a replacement for the wet-leased aircraft; it entered service in late June 1976. On 14 May 1977, a Boeing 707 was involved in an accident with fatalities near Lusaka. A Zambia Airways McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 at Leonardo da Vinci‚ÄìFiumicino Airport in 1989. The contract for managerial and technical assistance with Aer Lingus ended in March 1982, when a three-year agreement for the provision of operational and technical expertise was signed with Ethiopian Airlines. After reorganisation, Zambia Airways became a subsidiary of the government-owned Zambian Industrial and Mining Corporation in April 1982. A Boeing 727-200 was added to the fleet in 1983. On 4 July 1983, an HS-748, 9J-ADM, was involved in an accident in Kasaba with no serious injuries to the 46 people aboard. Zambia Airways became the sixth African customer for the DC-10 when an order for a 203-seater aircraft was placed in the first quarter of 1984. On 31 July 1984, the airline accepted the DC-10. The jet was deployed on the European corridor. Simultaneously, the Mauritius service was extended to Bombay in cooperation with Air India. Patrick Chisanga held the chairman position and the number of employees was 1,666. At this time, the airline undertook scheduled passenger and cargo services radiating from Lusaka to a number of domestic points and to Bombay, Dar-es-Salaam, Harare, Johannesburg, Larnaca, London, Mauritius, Nairobi and Rome with a fleet of one DC-10-30, four Boeing 707-320Cs, one Boeing 737-200 and two HS-748s. In December 1985, two Boeing 707-320Cs were transferred to NACZ. The airline's sole Boeing 757 freighter at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in 1991. This aircraft was destroyed in a mid-air collision in 2002 while operating with another airline. Aimed at returning the carrier to profitability, Lufthansa was hired in January 1986 to carry out a study over the performance of the technical and operational departments. In September the same year, Godfrey M. Mulundika was appointed as managing director. Two ATR-42 were ordered in 1987. These two aircraft entered the fleet during the summer of 1988, and came to replace the HS-748s on domestic and regional routes. Later on, one of these brand new ATR-42s was damaged while landing, but nobody resulted seriously injured. An MD-11 was ordered in 1989 for delivery in January 1992. the chairman position was held by Michael S. Mulenga and the number of employees was 2,134. At this time, the carrier's network included domestic points along with Bombay, Dar-es-Salaam, Entebbe, Frankfurt, Gaborone, Harare, Jeddah, London, Manzini, Nairobi, New York and Rome. The fleet consisted of two ATR-42-300s, two Boeing 737-200s, one DC-8-71 and one McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30. A Boeing 757 freighter leased from Ansett Worldwide Aviation made Zambia Airways the second non-American carrier, after Ethiopian Airlines, in operating the type. owing to financial difficulties, the airline had closed its offices in New York and Tokyo, terminated the transatlantic services to New York, and dropped plans to fly to Bangkok. Cost- cutting measures resulted in the dismissal of a number of employees as well. Services to Lubumbashi were re-introduced in 1992 after the war forced their suspension. Zambia Airways went out of business when it ceased operations in December 1994. Mounting debts and losses forced the government to put the airline into liquidation that month. Relaunch of the airline In a recent quest to re-launch the airline, Ethiopian Airlines in conjunction with the Zambian Government, has reached an agreement to re-establish the State airline on the Zambian Day of Independence, 24 October 2018. In August 2018, all parties involved deferred the launch date of the airline to 1 January 2019. On 20 August 2018, Ethiopian Airlines signed a definitive agreement with the Zambian Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), to acquire 45 percent shareholding in the revived air carrier for US$30 million. The plan is to start with local and regional routes and expand to intercontinental routes later. The revamped airlines plans to operate 12 planes by 2028. However in early 2019, the relaunch was delayed a second time as the airline's new board of directors had not met. On 8 August 2019 the government of Zambia delayed the relaunch of the airline again after Zambia's Centre for Trade Policy and Development (CTPD) sent a message stating that the airline should not be relaunched until Zambia was in a better economical state. There is currently no new date for the relaunch, despite this, on 18 September 2019, 25 flight attendants went to the Ethiopian Aviation Academy for a three month training program. In addition, Zambia Airways' CEO Bruk Endeshaw stated that the airline had been certified by the Zambian Civil Aviation Authority, and was awaiting its IATA and ICAO codes.

Written by the band's lead vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller, it was produced by the band's lead guitarist and backing vocalist Chad I Ginsburg and featured as the opening track on the band's 1999 debut studio album Volume 1. The song was also released as the album's only single in 1999. Despite not charting, it is considered to be CKY's most famous song and has been featured on a number of external releases. Background and release As with the rest of the Volume 1 album, \\"96 Quite Bitter Beings\\" was written by CKY frontman Deron Miller, and was reportedly conceived during an afternoon on which he decided not to go to work. Speaking about the song in 2015, Miller noted that it was the last to be written for the album, and that he came up with the riff at drummer Jess Margera's house after their regular rehearsal space had been flooded. Later pressings of Volume 1 co-credited the writing of the song (and the album) to Miller, Margera and guitarist Chad I Ginsburg, although the frontman upholds that this was a merely \\"cosmetic\\" measure. \\"96 Quite Bitter Beings\\" is the first CKY song in the \\"Hellview\\" series, a trilogy which tells \\"a story about a town that doesn‚Äôt take kindly to outsiders\\" and continued with \\"Escape from Hellview\\" on 2002's Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild and later \\"Hellions on Parade\\" on 2009's Carver City. After its release on Volume 1 and as a single in 1999, the track was included on the two-track extended play (EP) Hellview along with the second entry \\"Escape from Hellview\\" in 2003. On December 28, 2010, the band released a remastered version of the song as a digital download, backed with live recordings of An Answer Can Be Found tracks \\"Dressed in Decay\\" and \\"All Power to Slaves\\", and Volume 1 track \\"To All of You\\". In 2015, it was included on the limited edition vinyl compilation album The Best of CKY. Reception and legacy \\"96 Quite Bitter Beings\\" has generally been praised by music critics and fans since its original release. In a review of Volume 1 for Slant magazine, Aaron Scott proposed that the track showcases \\"CKY sounding their best\\", offering the following the description of the song: \\"the guitars stomp on your face, the drums alternately ride on the downbeat and hi- hat on the offbeat, while the vocals switch back and forth from matching the intensity of the riff to wooing us to sleep\\". Similarly, AllMusic's Bret Love identified the track as one of the highlights of the album, crediting the rotation of the song's music video on MTV for the band's early mainstream success. The members of CKY themselves have also described \\"96 Quite Bitter Beings\\" as \\"one of the band's most popular tracks\\". According to set list aggregation website setlist.fm, it is the most popular song played at CKY concerts. The track also appeared on the 2001 video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, with British music magazine NME describing it as \\"so intrinsically linked to 1990s skate culture\\". The \\"Shopping Carts\\" stunt skit filmed by CKY, which was aired in the first episode of Jackass, had the song playing at the background. The main guitar riff of the song was sampled by rapper Bazaar Royale on the song \\"What's It All For?\\", released in 2003 on the Cradle 2 the Grave soundtrack. After his departure from CKY in 2011, Miller formed a new band called 96 Bitter Beings. Music video The music video for \\"96 Quite Bitter Beings\\" was directed by Bam Margera, brother of drummer Jess, and released in the week of December 4, 2000. The video was later released, alongside \\"Disengage the Simulator\\", on the band's 2003 video album Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild: The Video Album. Writing a review of the album for the website The Movies Made Me Do It, Chad Connolly noted that the video is \\"pretty low-budget\\" but nonetheless \\"visually appealing\\".

Born in Preston, his family's humble circumstances forced him to start work at the age of fourteen. Both George and his younger brother, Richard (Dick), were prodigiously gifted mathematicians and draughtsmen. Grenfell-Baines left a secure, but limiting, job in the Lancashire County Architect's Office to work for the prestigious private firm of Bradshaw Gass & Hope in Bolton in 1930. During the 1930s, Grenfell-Baines became aware of Modernism, particularly the work of Le Corbusier and Gropius, through the architectural press and was determined to practise it himself. He studied at Manchester University for two years from 1934. It was at this time he adopted the name George Grenfell Baines at the suggestion of fellow student Gerald Hayforthwaite. Later this was hyphenated as Grenfell-Baines: Grenfell being his mother's maiden name. He was known to friends and colleagues as \\"GG\\". In 1935, he was awarded the Heywood prize for the design of reinforced concrete flats. The following year he was awarded the third prize in a competition for a new Rhodesian Parliament; the prize money, ¬£250, was enough to enable him to start his own practice. Grenfell-Baines's work for the Air Ministry during World War II brought him to the attention of Anthony Chitty and the London Modernists. Although Grenfell- Baines always chose to be based in Preston, he cultivated friendships in national and international circles. In 1951, he was invited to design a pavilion for the Festival of Britain. Grenfell-Baines's post-war work included the New Towns of Newton Aycliffe (planned 1947) and Peterlee (planned 1948). An abiding interest for GG was multidisciplinary working. His highly successful firm BDP (Building Design Partnership) was the result of numerous experiments in management structure. In 1972, he became professor of Architecture at Sheffield University where he founded the Design Teaching Partnership. He officially retired in 1974 but continued working as a consultant into his final decade. He received an OBE in 1960 and was knighted in 1978. Grenfell-Baines was survived by his second wife, Milena Fleischmann, whom he married in 1954, their son and daughter, and the two daughters of his first marriage, to Dorothy Hodson. Milena was a Czech refugee of the Kindertransport.

Located on Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie opposite the main Warsaw University campus, it is one of the most notable Baroque churches in Poland's capital. The Holy Cross Church is currently administered by the Missionary Friars of Vincent de Paul.  History  As early as the 15th century, a small wooden chapel of the Holy Cross had been erected here. In 1526 the chapel was demolished, and a newer church was erected. Refurbished and extended by Pawe≈Ç Zembrzuski in 1615, the church was too small to fill the needs of the growing city. Initially located well outside the city limits, by the 17th century it had become one of the main churches in the southern suburb (przedmie≈õcie) of the city that had in 1596 become Poland's capital. In 1653 Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga gave the church to the French order of Missionary Friars of Vincent de Paul. However, three years later Warsaw was captured by Swedish armies during the Deluge. Pillaged, the church was found to be damaged beyond repair. During the reign of King John III Sobieski the church's remnants were demolished, and it was decided to erect a new shrine. In the 18th century this became the origin of the gorzkie ≈ºale tradition. Tylman Gamerski. The main building was constructed between 1679 and 1696. Its main designer was J√≥zef Szymon Bellotti, the royal architect at the Royal Court of Poland. It was financed by abbot Kazimierz Szczuka and the Primate of Poland Micha≈Ç Stefan Radziejowski. The fa√ßade was relatively modest and reminded of Renaissance facades of the nearby churches. The two towers surrounding the fa√ßade were initially square- cut. Between 1725 and 1737 two late Baroque headpieces by J√≥zef Fontana. The fa√ßade itself was refurbished by Fontana's son, Jakub (in 1756) and ornamented with sculptures by Jan Jerzy Plersch. From 1765 the church was one of the most attended by Polish King Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus. It was also there that the King established the Order of St. Stanis≈Çaw and bestowed it upon loyal servants annually on May 8. On May 3, 1792, the Polish Diet gathered there on the first anniversary of the May 3rd Constitution. During the Warsaw Uprising of 1794, the stairs leading to the main entrance were destroyed and had to be replaced with new ones designed by Chrystian Piotr Aigner. Chopin's heart (just above the bouquet near bottom) During the Partitions, the church gained much importance, especially after the 1861 demonstration held before it, which was brutally put down by Russian Cossack troops ‚Äî sparking the January 1863 Uprising. On Christmas Day 1881, an outbreak of panic following a false alarm of fire in the crowded church caused the stampede deaths of twenty-nine persons. Jews were blamed for starting the panic, and the Warsaw pogrom of 1881 ensued.Brian Porter When Nationalism Began to Hate, Oxford University Press, 2002, , p.162 In the late 19th century the church interior was slightly refurbished, and in 1882 an urn containing the heart of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin was immured in a pillar. Some decades later, a similar urn was added with the heart of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont. In 1889 the external staircase leading to the main entrance was reconstructed, and a sculpture of Christ Bearing His Cross by Pius Welo≈Ñski was added. The sculpture bears the inscription, Sursum Corda (\\"Lift Up Your Hearts\\"), signifying the Poles' endurance under the Russian partition. In addition to urns containing the hearts of some of Poland's most renowned artists, there are several epitaphs to other notable Poles of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Juliusz S≈Çowacki, J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, Boles≈Çaw Prus, and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. During the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, the church was severely damaged. On 6 September 1944, when the Germans detonated two large Goliath tracked mines in the church (they usually carried 75‚Äì100 kg of high explosives) the facade was destroyed, together with many Baroque furnishings, the vaulting, the high altar, and side altars. Afterward the church was blown up by the Germans in January 1945. Between 1945 and 1953, the church was rebuilt in a simplified architectural form by B. Zborowski. The interior was reconstructed without the Baroque polychromes and frescos. The main altar was reconstructed between 1960 and 1972.  Burials  Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois Chopin (1810-1849): His heart is interred in the church. His body is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.  Trivia  * The Holy Cross Church and its gardens (now non-existent and occupied by the building of the Finance Ministry) gave their name to ≈öwiƒôtokrzyska Street, one of the most notable streets in central Warsaw. * Following the signing of the Gda≈Ñsk Accords between Solidarity and the communist government of the People's Republic of Poland in 1980, it was decided that a mass be transmitted countrywide via state-controlled radio. Since then, the mass has been recorded weekly at the church for transmission.

Taxonomy The taxonomic placement of Trachyteuthis is uncertain. Though often assigned to the order Vampyromorphida, the discovery of fossilised Trachyteuthis beaks in the Upper Jurassic limestone of Germany suggests a close phylogenetic relation to the Octopoda. It is clear that it does at least belong in the Coleoidea. It is thought to be very closely related to Teudopsis. Distribution Fossils are scarce but have been reported from the Kimmeridge clay of the UK; the Solnhofen limestone of Germany, Jurassic deposits in Antarctica, and Oxfordian deposits in Chile. History gladius structure of T. hastiformis First described in 1773 as the remnants of a fish, Trachyteuthis was considered comparable to a Sepia cuttlebone by R√ºppell in 1829. A separate genus was erected for the material in 1846 by Meyer. English material discovered in 1855 was termed Coccoteuthis latipinnis; this was later synonymised with the identical Solnhofen deposits. A 2007 survey of museum collection established that there were ground for the erection of three species within the genus.

The organisation currently has a membership of nearly 380 Full Members, 60 Associate and Life Members and 23 Overseas Members. Combined, the member schools employ around 6,000 people, and are responsible for educating about 100,000 primary aged children. History The IPSHA evolved largely from informal gatherings of New South Wales headmasters, which called itself the Junior Schools' Conference. The Organisation was established in 1952, when a conference was held at Cranbrook School, Sydney, where a constitution was agreed upon for the establishment of the Junior Schools' Conference of Australia. The organisation holds biennial conferences, which alternate between states. At the biennial Conference in Perth in 1984, the Constitution was amended and the Heads of Independent Girls' Schools became eligible for membership of the IPSHA. Along with this change, came eligibility for heads of co-educational junior schools to join, which provided a significant boost in membership.

It was located 37.6 km from Adelaide station. History Bridgewater station opened in the 1880s and was the terminus of the now defunct Bridgewater line. It consisted of three platforms, all of which are now demolished. Platform 1 was a side platform that was 140 metres long, and platforms 2 and 3 were an island platform 170 metres long. On 1 March 1978, the station became the eastern boundary of the State Transport Authority network. The station building on the main platform was burned down by arsonists in 1983. The station closed on 23 September 1987, when the State Transport Authority withdrew services on the route between Belair and Bridgewater. The offices and island platform were demolished around 1990, while the brick relay console and main platform were demolished in November 2006.

Cabochon and facet There are two general types of gemstone cutting: cabochon and facet. Cabochons are smooth, often domed, with flat backs. Agates and turquoise are usually cut this way, but precious stones such as rubies, emeralds and sapphires also may be. Many stones like star sapphires and moonstones must be cut this way in order to see the effects the stones have in them. A faceted shape resembles that of the modern diamond. It has a flat, polished surface, and it usually has a transparent surface that refracts light inside the gemstone and reflects light on the outside. In the case of a cabochon stone, the side of the stone is usually cut at a shallow angle, so that when the bezel is pushed over the stone that angle permits it to hold the stone in place and keep it tight. In the case of faceted stones a shallow groove is cut into the side of the bezel into which the girdle of the stone is placed, and then metal is pushed over, holding the stone in place. Cabochons can also be set into prong settings of various kinds, but the idea is the same‚Äîit is the prongs going over the angle of the stone that creates the pressure that holds the stone in place. Just as the angle of the sides of a cabochon creates the pressure to hold the stone in place, so there is an overlying principle in setting faceted stones. If one looks at a side view of a round diamond, for example, one will see that there is an outer edge, called the girdle, and the top angles up from there, and the bottom angles down from there. Faceted stones are set by \\"pinching\\" that angle with metal. If you imagine holding the girdle with the tips of your thumb and forefinger with both hands, that illustrates it fairly well. All of the styles of faceted stone setting use this concept in one way or another. Types of stonesetting There are thousands of variations of setting styles, but there are several fundamental types: =Bezel setting= A bezel set sapphire The earliest known technique of attaching stones to jewelry was bezel setting. A bezel is a strip of metal bent into the shape and size of the stone and then soldered to the piece of jewelry. Then the stone is inserted into the bezel and the metal rubbed over the stone, holding it in place. This method works well for either the cabochon or faceted stones. =Prong setting= Prong set diamonds Prong setting is the simplest and most common type of setting, largely because it uses the least amount of metal to hold the stone, thus showing it off to its best advantage. Generally it is simply some number of wires, called prongs, which are of a certain size and shape, arranged in a shape and size to hold the given stone, and fixed at the base. Then a burr of the proper size, is used to cut what is known as a \\"bearing\\", which is a notch that corresponds to the angles of the stone. The burr most often used is called a \\"hart bur\\" that is angled and sized for the job of setting diamonds. That bearing is cut equally into all of the prongs and at the same height above the base. Then the stone is inserted so that it goes into all of the bearings, pliers or a pusher are used to bend the prongs gently over the crown of the stone, and the tops of the prongs are clipped off with snips, filed to an even height above the stone, and finished. Usually a \\"cup burr\\" is used to give the prong a nice round tip. A cup burr is in the shape of a hemisphere with teeth on the inside, for making rounded tips on wires and prongs. There are many variations of prong settings including just two prongs, the common 4 prongs or up to 24 or more with many variations involving decoration, size and shapes of the prongs themselves, and how they are fixed or used in jewelry. But the method of setting is generally the same for all of them no matter how many prongs are present. =Channel setting= Channel set diamonds Channel setting is a method whereby stones are suspended between two bars or strips of metal, called channels. Often when setting small stones and the bars go in a line with the design it is called channel setting, and when the bars cross the lines of the design, it is called bar set. The idea is the same, though. The channel is some variation of a \\"U\\" shape, with two sides and a bottom. The sides are made just a bit narrower than the width of the stone or stones to be set, and then, using the same burs as in prong setting, a small notch, which is again called a bearing, is cut into each wall. The stone is put in place in those notches, and the metal on top is pushed down, tightening the stone in place. The proper way to set a channel is to cut a notch for each stone, but for cheaper production work sometimes a groove is cut along each channel. Also, since the metal can be very stiff and strong, this is a situation where a reciprocating hammer, which is like a jackhammer but jewelry sized, might be used to hammer down the metal, as it can be difficult to do by hand. Then, as always, the metal is filed down and finished, and the inner edge near the stones cleaned up and straightened as necessary. As with all jewelry, there can be many variations of channel work. At times the walls will be raised‚Äîsometimes a center stone will be set between two bars that rise high from the base ring‚Äîor the channel might just be cut directly into some surface, making the stones flush with the metal. It is still channel setting, though. =Bead setting= Example of bead set diamonds Example of pav√© set diamonds Bead setting is a generic term for setting a stone directly into metal using gravers, also called burins, which are essentially tiny chisels. A hole is drilled directly into the metal surface, and then a ball burr is used to make a concave depression just the size of the stone. Some setters will set the stone into that concave depression, and some will use a hart burr to cut a bearing around the edge. Then the stone is inserted into that space, and the gravers or burins are used to lift and push a tiny bit of the metal into and over the edge of the stone. Then a beading tool, which is simply a steel shaft with a concave dimple cut into the tip, is pushed onto the bit of metal, rounding and smoothing it, pushing it firmly onto the stone, and creating a \\"bead\\". That is the essential method, but there are many types of setting that use the technique. When many stones are set in this fashion very closely together, about 1 millimeter apart, covering a surface, that is called \\"pav√©\\"‚Äîfrom the French for paved or cobblestoned. When a long line is engraved into the metal going up to each of the beads, that is \\"star set\\", because of the look. The other common usage is called \\"bead and bright\\", \\"grain setting\\" or \\"threading\\" in Europe, and other names at times. This is when, after the stone is set as described above, the background metal around the stone is cut away, usually in geometric shapes. In the end what is left is the stone with four beads in a lowered box shape with an edge around it. Often it is a row of stones, so it will be in a long shape with a raised edge and a row of stones and beads down the center. This type of setting is still used often, but it was very common in the early to middle 20th century. =Burnish setting= Burnish set diamonds Burnish setting, also sometimes referred to as flush setting, shot setting, or gypsy setting is similar to bead setting, but after the stone is inserted into the space, instead of using a graver to lift beads, a burnishing tool is used to push the metal all around the stone. The stone will be roughly flush with the surface, with a burnished or rubbed edge around it. This type of setting has a long history but is gaining a resurgence in contemporary jewelry. Sometimes the metal is finished using sandblasting, as it shows off the work very well.

Power scalability is considered an important advantage in a laser design. Usually, power scaling requires a more powerful pump source, stronger cooling, and an increase in size. It may also require reduction of the background loss in the laser resonator and, in particular, in the gain medium. MOPA The most popular way of achieving power scalability is the \\"MOPA\\" (Master Oscillator Power Amplifier) approach. The master oscillator produces a highly coherent beam, and an optical amplifier is used to increase the power of the beam while preserving its main properties. The master oscillator has no need to be powerful, and has no need to operate at high efficiency because the efficiency is determined mainly by the power amplifier. The combination of several laser amplifiers seeded by a common master oscillator is essential concept of the High Power Laser Energy Research Facility. Inherently scalable designs =Disk lasers= A disk laser configuration presented in 1992 at the SPIE conference. One type of solid-state laser designed for good power scaling is the disk laser (or \\"active mirror\\" ). Such lasers are believed to be scalable to a power of several kilowatts from a single active element in continuous-wave operation. Perhaps, the expectations for power scalability of disk lasers is a little bit exaggerated: some of publications in favor of disk laser just repeat each other; compare, for example and; these articles differ with only titles. Amplified spontaneous emission, overheating and round-trip loss seem to be the most important processes that limit the power of disk lasers. For future power scaling, the reduction of the round-trip loss and/or combining of several active elements is required. =Fiber lasers= Fiber lasers are another type of solid-state laser with good power scaling. The power scaling of fiber lasers is limited by Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering, and by the fact that such lasers cannot be very long. The limited length of the double- clad fibers limits the usable power of the multi-mode pump, because the pump is not absorbed efficiently in the fiber's active core. Optimization of the shape of the cladding can extend the limit of power scaling. Fiber disk lasers The limit of power scaling of fiber lasers can be extended with lateral delivery of the pump. This is realized in so-called fiber disk lasers . The pump in such a laser is delivered from side of a disk, made of coiled fiber with doped core. Several such disks (with a coolant between them) can be combined into a stack. Problem of heat sink The power scaling is limited by the ability to dissipate the heat. Usually, the thermal conductivity of materials designed for efficient laser action, is small compared to that of materials optimal for the heat transfer (metals, diamonds). For the efficient drain of heat from a compact device, the active medium should be a narrow slab; in order to give advantage to the amplification of light at wanted direction over the ASE, the energy and head would be withdrawn in orthogonal directions, as it is shown in figure. At low background loss (typically, at the level of 0.01 or 0.001) the heat and the light can be withdrawn in the opposite directions, allowing active elements of wide aperture. In this case, combining of several active elements is used for the power scaling. Coherent addition and combining beams Coherent addition of 4 fiber lasers. Scalability can also be achieved by combining separate laser beams. Completely independent beams cannot usually be combined to produce a beam with higher radiance than each beam has alone. Beams can only be combined if they are coherent with each other. Such beams can be combined actively or passively. In the passive combining (or coherent addition) of lasers, only the few modes common to all of the combined lasers can be above the lasing threshold. Efficient passive combining of eight lasers has been reported. Further power scaling requires exponential growth of the gain bandwidth and/or length of the individual lasers. Active combining implies the real-time measurement of the phase of individual lasers' output, and quick adjustment to keep them all in phase. Such adjustment can be done by adaptive optics, which is effective for suppression of phase noise at acoustic frequencies. Faster schemes based on all-optical switching are being researched.

As such, it is located in secretory vesicles of neurons and endocrine cells such as islet beta cell secretory granules in the pancreas. In humans, chromogranin A protein is encoded by the CHGA gene.  Tissue distribution  Examples of cells producing chromogranin A (ChgA) are chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, paraganglia, enterochromaffin-like cells and beta cells of the pancreas. It is present in islet beta cell secretory granules.  Function  Chromogranin A is the precursor to several functional peptides including vasostatin-1, vasostatin-2, pancreastatin, catestatin and parastatin. These peptides negatively modulate the neuroendocrine function of the releasing cell (autocrine) or nearby cells (paracrine). Chromogranin A induces and promotes the generation of secretory granules such as those containing insulin in pancreatic islet beta cells.  Clinical significance  Micrograph of a paraganglioma stained with chromogranin A immunostain. Chromogranin A is elevated in pheochromocytomas. It has been identified as autoantigen in type 1 diabetes. A peptide fragment of ChgA located in the Vasostatin-1, namely ChgA29-42 has been identified as the antigenic epitope recognized by diabetogenic BDC2.5 T cells from type 1 diabetes prone NOD mice. It is used as an indicator for pancreas and prostate cancer and in carcinoid syndrome.https://www.bjbms.org/ojs/index.php/bjbms/article/view/4632 It might play a role in early neoplasic progression. Chromogranin A is cleaved by an endogenous prohormone convertase to produce several peptide fragments. See chromogranin A GeneRIFs for references. In immunohistochemistry it can be used to identify a range of neuroendocrine tumours and is highly specific for both benign and malignant cells of this type. Mass spec data shows that several peptides originating from CHGA (163-194; 194-214; 272-295;) are significantly lower in samples from ulcerative colitis patients compared to control biopsies. There are considerable differences in the amino acid composition between different species' chromogranin A . Commercial assays for measuring human CGA can usually not be used for measuring CGA in samples from other animals. Some specific parts of the molecule have a higher degree of amino acid homology and methods where the antibodies are directed against specific epitopes can be used to measure samples from different animals. Region- specific assays measuring defined parts of CGA, CGB and SG2 can be used for measurements in samples from cats and dogs. In dogs, the catestatin concentration showed weak negative associations with left atrial and ventricular sizes and the catestatin concentration showed weak positive associations with blood pressure.

Queen Helena was the daughter of Michael II Komnenos Doukas, Despot of Epirus, and Theodora Petraliphaina. Her marriage was an expression of the alliance of her father and the ruler of Sicily against the growing power of the Empire of Nicaea.Donald M. Nicol, The last centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453, second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 28  Marriage  Queen Helena's dowry She was married to Manfred of Sicily 2 June 1259, after the death of his first wife Beatrice of Savoy in 1257 and his own rise to the throne on 10 August 1258. D. J. Geanakoplos notes that this marriage was surprising, considering Manfred's father Frederick II had been in an alliance with John III Vatatzes, the late ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, but \\"one must consider that conquest of the Byzantine Empire had been a traditional Norman aim for almost a century, and that Manfred was now in a strong enough position in Italy to discard his father's alliance and to look to those who could assist him in his ambitions for Balkan domination.\\"Geanakoplos, \\"Greco-Latin Relations on the Eve of the Byzantine Restoration: The Battle of Pelagonia-1259\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 7 (1953), p. 104 Few details of how this marriage was arranged have come down to us. \\"It would be of interest,\\" Geanakoplos observes, \\"to know who took the initiative to promote the marriage alliance; whether Manfred's marriage preceded that of William of Achaea to Anna, another daughter of Michael II; and, most important, whether Manfred's Epirote possessions were secured from Michael II actually as a result of conquest or as a dowry.\\"Geanakoplos, \\"Greco-Latin Relations\\", p. 105 Manfred had captured Dyrrhachium and its surrounding area within the following two years.

He is currently an Executive Director of HGGC, where he also previously served as CEO and Chairman. He is also the former chairman of Citi Holdings. He has served on the boards of Staples Inc., Ryerson, Inc., TJX Companies, and Utah Capital Investment Corp. From 2000 to 2007, Crittenden was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of American Express, and from March 2007 to March 2009, he was the chief financial officer of Citigroup. Early life and education Crittenden was raised in Ogden, Utah. He was the student body president at Ogden High School in 1971. He served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Germany, and graduated from BYU's Marriott School of Management with a bachelor of science degree in management in 1976. He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1979. Career Crittenden began his career as a consultant at Bain and Company where he worked on various strategic projects in the United States and Germany. Crittenden served as CFO and executive Vice President at Melville Corp. While at Melville, he was the architect of the breakup of the company that led a significant increase in share price as the company was split into three firms. He was the CFO of Sears Roebuck and Company from 1997 to 1998. He then served as the CFO of Monsanto Company from 1998 to 2000. At Monsanto, Crittenden led the efforts to acquire seed companies DeKalb Genetics Corporation, and the Delta and Pine Land Company. He also played a key role in the eventual sale of Monsanto to Pharmacia & Upjohn. Prior to joining Citigroup, Crittenden was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of American Express, as well as the head of the company's Global Network Services division. In 2007, Crittenden joined Citigroup as CFO. At Citigroup, he led the reengineering effort that cut 75,000 jobs, reduced assets by around $500 billion, and helped guide the firm through the financial crisis. In 2010 Crittenden and the company settled claims of disclosure errors brought by the SEC, without admitting wrongdoing on the part of Crittenden, in connection with Citigroup's exposure to subprime mortgage assets. In April 2012, Crittenden was named CEO of Huntsman Gay Global Capital. In his first year at HGGC, Crittenden oversaw the sale of the utilities services holding company Power Holdings to Kelso & Co. for $380 million. Prior to Crittenden's arrival, Huntsman Gay Global Capital created Power Holdings by acquiring several utilities services throughout the United States. In just over two years, Power Holdings grew from approximately 90 utility crews to more than 200 crews. Crittenden and HGGC completed the sale via the $1.1 billion Huntsman Gay Capital Partners Fund I LP. In 2013, Crittenden became the chairman of Huntsman Gay Global Capital (HGGC) after co-founder Richard Lawson took over as chief executive. As chairman of HGCC, Crittenden oversaw the establishment of the firm's second vehicle, Fund II. Fund II will generally adhere to HGGC investment criteria such as revenues of $100 million or more, enterprise values of $100‚Äì500 million, and EBITDA of at least $15 million. In December 2013, Crittenden oversaw the acquisition of Lucent Polymers by the HGGC company Citadel Plastics Holdings, a top global thermoplastics and thermoset resins compounder. The acquisition gave Citadel Plastics access to a portfolio of over 1,400 formulations and enhanced its position in the engineered resins sector. Crittenden heralded the acquisition as a prime example of growth via strategic acquisition and integration of successful, complementary businesses. According to Crittenden, Citadel Plastics will benefit greatly from the financial strength and blue-chip customer base of Lucent, as well as its numerous development initiatives. The Lucent acquisition was Citadel's seventh since 2007 and the 31st overall acquisition for HGGC. Crittenden currently serves as the chairman of iQor, a global business process outsourcing services provider based in New York City. In January 2014, iQor acquired the aftermarket services business of Jabil Circuit, Inc. for $725 million.

It is a slow, mournful ballad with a somber theme and no chorus. Overview The song concerns √âamonn √ì Riain (Edmund O'Ryanhttp://socrates.berkeley.edu/~caforum/volume1/vol1_article4.html), an Irish aristocrat who lived in County Tipperary from 1670‚Äì1724 and led a bandit or rapparee gang. Although there is no positive proof of O'Ryan's existence, he is mentioned in a pamphlet of 1694, in which he and four other raparee leaders called for the overthrow of William of Orange in favour of the Catholic James II.Eamonn O Ciardha, Ireland and the Jacobite Cause 1685-1766 The background to Ryan's career was the confiscation of Irish Catholic land in the Act of Settlement 1652 after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland when many dispossessed landowners became outlaws, known as \\"tories\\" or \\"rapparees\\". Their ranks were swelled after the Williamite War of 1689-91, when many of the defeated Catholic Jacobites turned to banditry. It is likely that Ryan himself served in the Jacobite army. It is said that Ryan became a rapparee or outlaw after shooting a tax collector dead during a quarrel over the confiscation of a poor woman's cow. Various other stories are told in which √ì Riain plays the role of the rebel hero who battles authority in the mode of Robin Hood and countless others. According to James Clarence Mangan, O'Ryan was born in Shanbohy, in the parish of Temple-beg, in the upper half-barony of Kilnemanagh in Tipperary, \\"previous to the wars of 1690\\". His father retained considerable land even after the plunders of 1641 and was from a family who had lost most of their land backing the Desmond struggles in the Elizabethan years. His mother was from the family of the O'Dwyers, lords of Kilnemanagh. O'Ryan was educated on the Continent for the priesthood, but \\"by an affair in which he took a prominent part\\" had to relinquish that plan. \\"After many strange vicissitudes\\", he was buried near Faill an Chluig, in the parish of Toem, in the upper half-barony of Kilnemanagh, near the Hollyford copper mine, and \\"the precise spot is marked on sheet 45 of the Ordnance Survey of Tipperary as the grave of Eamonn an Chnoic.\\"Poets and Poetry of Munster by James Clarence Mangan From internal evidence, Mangan posits that the poem was written in 1739, year of the great frost. Song variants The song is usually sung in Irish, but various English versions are popular as well. Other versions also highlight the failure of √ì Riain's countrymen to come to rally to his defence and more strongly emphasize that √ì Riain had been a man of wealth and influence. \\"√âamonn an Chnoic\\" has been recorded by countless artists in both English and Irish. Some versions, such as the \\"Young Ned of the Hill\\" recorded by The Pogues, adapt the lyrics to a fast-tempo song with only a passing similarity to the original folk song. Completely instrumental versions are also common. See also * Colonel John Hurley * Irish rebel songs Notes References *\\"Ned of the Hill\\" (2006). Sing Out! The Folk Song Magazine.

It may actually be considered an EP as it features only six songs, but each song's duration of +6 minutes makes up for a total playing time of 43:45. The album's content is modeled on Hunter's own, sophisticated interpretation of the EDM patterns already established in his debut album, Exodus, while including elements similar to Nine Inch Nails. These include long tracks, strongly pounding rhythms, pulsating synths, samples of power guitar chords broken down into computer- sequenced tracks, processed vocals and, most importantly, Christian-themed lyrics, as Hunter¬∞ is known as a Christian DJ. Three of the songs use biblical quotations as lyrics (\\"Come on\\", from the Lord's Prayer, in the Gospel of Matthew, 6: 9-13; \\"Wonderful\\", from the Book of Jeremiah, 1: 5; \\"To Life, To Love\\", from the Song of Solomon, 5: 1), the other three feature original lyrics. In the CD's booklet, \\"you\\" in the non-biblical material is always written without a capital Y, but, as Hunter¬∞ has stated on his official website , the \\"you\\" in the lyrics refers to God; the songs are always intended as invocations and praises to God.

The 403-page report had suggestions and solutions for the inclusive development of the Muslims in India.https://www.gktoday.com/gk/10-years-of-sachar-committee-report/ Background In 2004, the Congress Party returned to power in India after having been in opposition for eight years, an unprecedented length of time for a party which had ruled the country for fifty-two out of fifty-seven years between 1947 and 2004. It returned to power as head of a coalition, winning 145/543 seats in the Lok Sabha. One of its initiatives was the commissioning of a report on the latest social, economic, and educational conditions of the Muslim community of India Composition The committee was composed of seven members. The committee was headed by Rajinder Sachar, former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court. The other members of the committee were Sayyid Hamid, M.A. Basith, Akhtar Majeed, Abu Saleh Shariff, T.K. Oommen and Rakesh Basant. The Prime Minister also appointed Syed Zafar Mahmood to serve as Officer on Special Duty to the Committee. The committee did not include any female members, although it did meet with women's groups and activists. Report The committee, which was appointed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, was headed by former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court Rajinder Sachar, as well as six other members. The committee prepared a 403-page report and presented it to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, on 30 November 2006, 20 months after obtaining the terms of reference from the Prime Minister's Office.Clarification On the Work of Justice Rajindar Sachar Committee This report highlighted issues facing the Muslim community and their representation in Indian public life, The report made observations on the high birthrate in the Muslim community in comparison to Hindus: the committee estimated that the Muslim proportion will stabilize at between 17% and 21% of the Indian population by 2100. The Sachar Committee highlighted and presented its suggestions on how to remove impediments those preventing Indian Muslims from fully participating in the economic, political, and social mainstream of Indian life. The report was the first of its kind to reveal the \\"backwardness\\" (a term used in Indian academic and legal discourse for historically dispossessed or economically vulnerable communities, not meant to be pejorative) of Indian Muslims. An issue highlighted was that while Muslims constitute 14% of the Indian population, they only comprise 2.5% of the Indian bureaucracy. The Sachar Committee concluded that the conditions facing Indian Muslims was below that of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Sachar Committee Report brought the issue of Muslim Indian inequality to national attention, sparking a discussion that is still ongoing. The Committee recommended setting up an Equal Opportunity Commission to provide a legal mechanism to address discrimination complaints, including in matters such as housing. In response to the Committee's findings, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram proposed an increase to the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation's (NMDFC) budget, citing new duties and expanded outreach that the institution would take on to implement the Committee's recommendations.More funds for minorities' welfare Methodology The Sachar Committee used 2001 census data to understand the demographic profile, infrastructure availability, and educational achievements of the population. It also used data from the National Sample Surveys (NSSO 55th and 61st Rounds) to analyze issues relating to employment, education, consumption patterns, and levels of poverty. Banking data was received from different sources such as the Reserve Bank of India, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Small Industries Development Bank of India, National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation, and the National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation. Corroborative data was also obtained from government commissions and organisations such as the National Commission for Backward Classes, the State Backward Classes Commission, and the National Council of Educational Research and Training. Finally, data from other sources, including ministries, departments, public sector undertakings, universities, and colleges were used in preparing this report. Criticism In November 2013, Gujarat government contended before the Supreme Court that the Rajinder Sachar Committee was \\"unconstitutional,\\" and that it only sought to help Muslims. It has strongly criticized the manner in which the PMO set up the Sachar Committee in 2005 to survey the socio-economic conditions of Muslims, while \\"ignoring\\" other religious minorities. This affidavit was filed in response to the Centre's stand that the scheme was valid and that the Modi Government was to blame for the deteriorating condition of Muslims in Gujarat.

The RAF squadron at Badangi comprised Supermarine Spitfire fighters, Hawker Hurricane fighters, Avro Lancaster bombers, Vickers Wellington bombers, Bristol Beaufighter bombers and Douglas Dakota transport aircraft. It was closed in 1946, as the war was over. Today, the huge seven-inch thick solid concrete runway that is being used by the local farmers for threshing the grains. All the other structures have been demolished.

He was a member of United Nations Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and also served as a counsel for the People's Union for Civil Liberties. Sachar chaired the Sachar Committee, constituted by the Government of India, which submitted a report on the social, economic and educational status of Muslims in India. On 16 August 2011 Sachar was arrested in New Delhi during protests over the detention of Anna Hazare and his supporters. Early years Rajindar Sachar was born on 22 December 1923. His father was Bhim Sen Sachar. His grandfather was a well-known criminal lawyer in Lahore. He attended the D.A.V. High School in Lahore, then went on to Government College Lahore and Law College, Lahore. On 22 April 1952 Sachar enrolled as an advocate at Simla. On 8 December 1960 he became an advocate in the Supreme Court of India, engaging in a wide variety of cases concerning civil, criminal and revenue issues. In 1963 a breakaway group of legislators left the Congress party and formed the independent \\"Prajatantra Party\\". Sachar helped this group prepare memoranda levelling charges of corruption and mal-administration against Pratap Singh Kairon, Chief Minister of the Indian state of Punjab. Justice Sudhi Ranjan Das was appointed to look into the charges, and in June 1964 found Kairon guilty on eight counts. Judge Justice Rajinder Sachar in a Program On 12 February 1970 Sachar was appointed Additional Judge of the Delhi High Court for a two- year term, and on 12 February 1972 he was reappointed for another two years. On 5 July 1972 he was appointed a permanent Judge of the High Court. He was acting chief justice of the Sikkim High court from 16 May 1975 until 10 May 1976, when he was made a judge in the Rajasthan High Court. The transfer from Sikkim to Rajasthan was made without Sachar's consent during the Emergency (June 1975 ‚Äì March 1977) when elections and civil liberties were suspended. Sachar was one of the judges that refused to follow the bidding of the Emergency establishment, and who were transferred as a form of punishment. After the restoral of democracy, on 9 July 1977 he was transferred back to the Delhi High Court. In June 1977 Justice Sachar was appointed by the government to chair a committee that reviewed the Companies Act and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, submitting an encyclopaedic report on the subject in August 1978. Sachar's committee recommended a major overhaul of the corporate reporting system, and particularly of the approach to reporting on social impacts. In May 1984 Sachar reviewed the Industrial Disputes Act, including the backlog of cases. His report was scathing. He said \\"A more horrendous and despairing situation can hardly be imagined... the load at present in the various Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals is so disproportionate to what can conceivably be borne ... that the arrears can only go on increasing if the present state of affairs is not improved... It is harsh and unjust to both the employers and employees if the cases continue to remain undecided for years\\". In November 1984, Justice Sachar issued notice to the police on a writ petition filed by Public Union for Democratic Rights on the basis of evidence collected from 1984 Sikh riot victims, asking FIRs to be registered against leaders named in affidavits of victims. However, in the next hearing the case was removed from the Court of Mr. Sachar and brought before two other Judges, who impressed petitioners to withdraw their petition in the national interest, which they declined, then dismissed the petition. Justice Sachar declared much later that his memory is still haunted by the reminiscence of not being able to get FIR registered in these cases. Sachar was Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court from 6 August 1985 until his retirement on 22 December 1985. Later career =Civil liberties= Sachar was one of the authors of a report issued on 22 April 1990 on behalf of the People's Union for Civil Liberties and others entitled \\"Report on Kashmir Situation\\". In January 1992 Sachar was one of the signatories to an appeal to all Punjabis asking them to ensure that the forthcoming elections were free and were seen to be free. They asked the people to ensure there was no violence, coercion or unfair practices that would prevent the people from electing the government of their choice. Sachar was appointed to a high-level Advisory Committee chaired by Chief Justice Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi to review the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 and determine whether structural changes and amendments were needed. The committee prepared a draft amendment Bill incorporating its recommendations. These included changes to the membership of the National Human Rights Commission, changes to procedures to reduce delays in following up recommendations and a broadening of the commission's scope. The recommendations were submitted the Home Affairs ministry on 7 March 2000. In April 2003, as council for the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Sachar argued before the Supreme Court of India that the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act (POTA) should be quashed since it violated fundamental rights. On 24 November 2002 the police arrested twenty six people in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu, and on 10 January 2003 they were placed under POTA by the government on the grounds that they were members of the Radical Youth League of the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist). On 26 August 2004, still being held without trial, the detainees began a hunger strike. Sachar led a team of human rights activists who visited them in jail on 15 September 2004 and persuaded them to end the hunger strike. POTA was repealed on 10 November 2004. However, all the POTA provisions were incorporated in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. In October 2009 Sachar called for abolition of these laws. He said \\"Terrorism is there, I admit, but in the name of terror probe, many innocent people are taken into custody without registering a charge and are being detained for long period\\". =Housing rights= Mr. Sachar in Sept. 2012 Sachar, who had formerly been a United Nations special rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, headed a mission that investigated housing rights in Kenya for the Housing and Land Rights Committee of the Habitat International Coalition. In its report issued in March 2000 the mission found that the Kenyan government had failed to meet its international obligations regarding protection of its citizens' housing rights. The report described misallocation of public land, evictions and land-grabbing by corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. Rajindra Sachar participated with retired justices Hosbet Suresh and Siraj Mehfuz Daud in an investigation by the Indian People's Human Rights Tribunal into a massive slum clearance drive in Mumbai, which had the ostensible purpose of preserving the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The demolitions on 22‚Äì23 January 2000 had been undertaken despite a notification from the state government to stay demolitions until September. The people had not been allowed to take the remains of their homes, which had been burnt. Sachar described the scene as \\"Barbaric, savage. It's as if a bomb has fallen here\\". In August 2000 the judges, joined by former Supreme Court judge V. R. Krishna Iyer, held a two- day hearing into the clearances in which about 60,000 people had been evicted. The inquiry covered both legal aspects of the clearances and the human impact. Sachar headed a People's Court in 2002 to deliberate on people affected by evictions required to widen the Beliaghata Circular Canal in Kolkata, needed for health and safety purposes. Most of the people were poor handcart pullers, maidservants, hawkers and so on. The court called for consultation with the affected people as part of the project's decision-making process. They should be treated humanely, without force or coercion, and should not be evicted during periods of bad weather. =Sachar committee= In March 2005 Justice Rajinder Sachar was appointed to a committee to study the condition of the Muslim community in India and to prepare a comprehensive report on their social, economic and educational status. On 17 November 2006 he presented the report, entitled \\"Report on Social, Economic and Educational Status of the Muslim Community of India\\", to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The report showed the growing social and economic insecurity that had been imposed on Muslims since independence sixty years earlier. It found that the Muslim population, estimated at over 138 million in 2001, were under-represented in the civil service, police, military and in politics. Muslims were more likely to be poor, illiterate, unhealthy and to have trouble with the law than other Indians. Muslims were accused of being against the Indian state, of being terrorists, and politicians who tried to help them risked being accused of \\"appeasing\\" them. The Sachar Committee recommendations aimed to promote inclusion of the diverse communities in India and their equal treatment. It emphasised initiatives that were general rather than specific to any one community. It was a landmark in the debate on the Muslim question in India. The speed of implementation would naturally depend on political factors including the extent of backlash from Hindutva groups. The Sachar Committee Report recommended setting up an institutional structure for an Equal Opportunity Commission. An expert group was established that presented a report, including a draft bill to establish such a commission, in February 2008. There was opposition. Thus, a speaker at a seminar in April 2008 sponsored by a group called \\"Bharatiya Vichar Manch\\" described the report as unconstitutional, saying \\"It should be rejected completely. It is on communal lines and will divide the country. It is a result of vote bank politics\\". =Other activities= Justice (Rtd) Rajinder Sachar addressing the Parliament March organised by AIMSS on the International Women's Day, 2010 In 2003, as counsel for the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), Sachar and Prashant Bhushan challenged the government's plans to privatise Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum. CPIL said that the only way to disinvest in the companies would be to repeal or amend the Acts by which they were nationalised in the 1970s. In December 2009 it was reported that Sachar was being proposed as Governor of West Bengal to replace Gopalkrishna Gandhi, whose term had expired. In the event, Devanand Konwar was appointed acting governor. At the age of eighty-seven Sachar was detained by Delhi Police on 16 August 2011 during the India Against Corruption protest. The arrest was for unlawful assembly and for making speeches in a location where a magistrate had declared the Section 144 rules were in force. Sachar claimed that he knew the law and should not be arrested, but despite this he was taken into custody. Other statements In 1989‚Äì1990 the Central Bureau of Investigation launched an inquiry into kickbacks in a government gun purchase deal. The inquiry was abandoned after the V. P. Singh government fell. Sachar called for the 500 pages of documents collected during the inquiry to be made public, saying: \\"There is no reason why the public should not be told of the full contents of the Bofors papers and only delay in disclosing the contents will unnecessarily expose the government to the charge of political manipulation\\". He said in 1992: \\"... the bureaucracy deviates from rules in the hope of basking in political favour. But this is short-term approach. Soon, the bureaucracy will find that after the massive ego and power lust of the politicians are satisfied, there comes a day when the bureaucrat is at the receiving end. And there is no one to support him because in league with politicians he has destroyed the strength of the public opinion. Bureaucrat is an unruly horse but has the potential to win the Derby, provided the Jockey is the expert, capable of giving proper motivation and desired direction. Politician with Bureaucratic mould of course, would do better,\\". In March 2003 Sachar was a signatory to a statement that condemned the US-led invasion of Iraq, calling it \\"unprovoked, unjustified, violates international law and constitut[ing] an act of aggression\\". Other signatories included Shanti Bhushan, Pavani Parameswara Rao, Rajeev Dhavan, Kapil Sibal and Prashant Bhushan. Commenting on the rise of crime against women, Sachar has stated that reservations for women in parliament could help eliminate gender bias in legal cases. He has said \\"There are about 200 OBC candidates in the Lok Sabha. It is not their public service, but merely the caste configuration that has preferred them. Similar results will follow even after the reservation for women\\". Sachar has said: \\"I have deep faith in the judiciary ... like any other institution the judiciary may not have come up to the expectation; but that does not mean that the entire judiciary should be accused\\". However, he has also spoken in favour of a national Judicial Commission, including members other than lawyers and judges, that would investigate issues concerning the administration of justice including the conduct of judges. In 2003 he said: \\"There is an insistent public demand now that matters connected with appointments and misdemeanours of the higher judiciary need to be dealt with by an independent body using transparent means instead of the present unsatisfactory mechanism shrouded in secrecy\\". Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code outlaws disaffection against the state, and allows for penalties of life imprisonment. Jawaharlal Nehru told the Indian parliament in 1951 that \\"the sooner we get rid of it the better\\". In January 2012 Rajinder Sachar said \\"It seems tragic that we should be asking the government to redeem the pledge of Nehru. For having a democratic society, it is necessary that these laws go\\". Death Sachar was suffering from ischemic heart disease and had an artificial cardiac pacemaker implanted. In April 2018, he was admitted to the Fortis Hospital in New Delhi, following complaint of recurrent vomiting. During the course of his treatment he contracted pneumonia and died on 20 April, Friday midnight. He was 94 years old. Sachar's body was cremated at Lodhi Road.

Headstone on Nat Buchanan's grave, Walcha, NSW Plaque commemorating Nat Buchanan, Walcha, NSW Nathaniel Buchanan (1826 - 23 September 1901) was an Australian pioneer pastoralist, drover and explorer. Early life Buchanan was born near Dublin, and was of Scottish descentUp rode the squatter Hector Holthouse p123 Rigby, 1970 - Biography & AutobiographyThe Australian people:an encyclopedia of the nation, its people and their origins James Jupp p659 Cambridge University Press, 2001Debrett's handbook of Australia and New Zealand Debrett's Peerage Limited, Suzanne Duke, Debrett's Peerage (Firm) - 1984The Scots in Australia:a study of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, 1788-1900 the son of Lieutenant Charles Henry Buchanan, and his wife Annie, n√©e White. He arrived in New South Wales with his parents in 1832, and as a young man was part owner with two brothers of Bald Blair station. In 1850 the brothers went to the California Gold Rush, but returned to Australia after a short stay to find that their station had been mismanaged and lost in their absence. During the next few years Buchanan had much experience of overlanding. Career In 1859 Buchanan explored new country with William Landsborough, principally on the tributaries of the Fitzroy River, Queensland, when both suffered many privations and were found just in time by a rescue party. Buchanan then joined Landsborough and others as owners of Bowen Downs Station near Longreach, Queensland, which for a time prospered. However, a time came when cattle were almost unsaleable, and the price of wool dropped so low that the station had to be given up and Buchanan was practically penniless. Buchanan made several explorations inland from Bowen Downs, including securing land near Burketown, Queensland. In October 1877, with a companion, Sam Croker, Buchanan began to investigate the country from the known regions round the Rankine to the overland telegraph line, around away. They discovered much good new land, part of the Barkly Tableland, and has since carried some of the largest herds in Australia. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s Buchanan did a large amount of pioneering, working principally in northern Queensland and the Northern Territory. Buchanan was also noted for his overlanding feats including droving 20,000 head of cattle from Queensland to Glencoe Station. He had another property, Wave Hill, for a period, but he lost this in 1894 on account of a great fall in cattle prices and the difficulty in getting markets. His son, Gordon Buchanan, had taken up land at Flora valley in 1887 and Buchanan now established this as his headquarters. About two years later, with another man and an aboriginal boy, he started with camels and equipment provided by the South Australian government to find a stock route from northern Queensland. He went from Oodnadatta up the line to Tennant Creek, and then westward to Sturt's Creek. About from Hooker's Creek he sighted the hills now named Buchanan Hills, and next day came to a branch of Hooker's Creek. Then he went to Hale's Creek and the Sturt, and then to Flora valley. Attempts were made to find a practicable stock route to the west with no success. Returning to Flora Creek he prepared a report for the South Australian government which added much to the knowledge of the country, though Buchanan had failed in his main object. In 1899 Buchanan, now 73 years of age, bought a farm on Dungowan Creek, from Tamworth and he died there in 1901 still working. Nat was buried in the general cemetery at Walcha, New South Wales. He married in 1863 Catherine Gordon who survived him, along with a son. Legacy Buchanan was a great bushman and a good explorer. He knew the country from northern Queensland to Western Australia very well. He rarely made much money for himself though he was a pioneer on Bowen Downs, on the Barkly Tableland, on the Roper River, and on the Victoria River, and pioneered the trail from the Kimberleys towards Perth. When he died, he owned almost no land, but he made possibilities for other men who in many cases reaped where he had sown. His brother William had also been a significant pastoralist pioneer.

The plaque on the north face of the Hall (see below) indicates that the original building dates back to about 1530 but since then there have been two notable reconstructions. Several prominent people have been residents of the house the most notable being Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for a short time. During the First World War the house was used as a convalescent home for wounded American Officers. In the Second World War the Americans again used the house as a military hospital after which it was taken over by the RAF and an extensive hospital developed in the grounds. It reverted to private use in the 1980s. In 2004 there was a major fire which left the building in a derelict state. Options are currently being considered regarding the future of the building. Early history Plaque near front door of Nocton Hall describing its history Nocton Hall in 1901 The historic grounds upon which Nocton Hall stands previously contained both a house and priory. Nocton Priory was built in the 12th century and the house was constructed in the 16th century and coexisted with the priory. The remains of the priory still exist as earthworks and are located at least from the house. The house was called Nocton Manor and was the property of Thomas Wimbishe and subsequently the Towneley family. In the 1670s while Nocton belonged to Sir Charles Stanhope, his niece Elizabeth Delavel Livingston put on a performance of Il pastor fido for 300 people, an important example of country house drama performed by amateurs for a large audience.Alison Findlay, 'Licensed to Thrill: Early Restoration Drama', in Alison Findlay, Gweno Williams, Stephanie Hodgson- Wright, Women and Dramatic Production 1550-1700 (London, 2000), pp. 144-6. This house was reconstructed by Sir William Ellis in the latter part of the 17th century by extending parts of the existing Towneley manor and was called Nocton Old Hall. In 1834 Nocton Old Hall was engulfed by fire and the current building was erected in 1841 by the 1st Earl of Ripon. In 1996 before the recent fire an examination of the house was made and some evidence was found that the 1841 building contained some parts of Nocton Old Hall.Carol Bennett, 1996. p. 39. There is a plaque on the northern elevation of the building, near the front door (shown on the right) which indicates that the Earl and Countess of Ripon who reconstructed the current building in 1841 believed that it was founded in about 1530. The inscription is in Latin, but reads in translation: Nocton Hall, then the property of Thomas Wimbishe, was visited by Henry VIII and Catherine Howard in 1541 during the King's northern progress. Henry's fifth wife, Catherine, reputedly planted the great chestnut tree in the grounds at Nocton on 13 October 1541. The tree still stands today. Frederick and Sarah Robinson, 1st Earl and Countess of Ripon Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon Sarah Robinson, 1st Countess of Ripon Frederick John Robinson was born in 1782. His parents were Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham and Lady Mary, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Hardwicke. He was educated at Harrow and Cambridge University and was regarded as a very bright student. Sarah, his wife was born in 1793 and was eleven years his junior. She was the only child of Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire who owned Nocton Old Hall. On his death in 1816 she inherited his property. Frederick became Tory M.P. for Carlow borough in 1806 and for Ripon in 1807-27. He was secretary of state for the colonies in 1809, Lord of the Admiralty 1810-12, Privy Councillor in 1812, a Lord of the Treasury in 1812, Paymaster-General of the forces in 1812-17 and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1823-27. In 1827 he became Prime Minister after the death of Canning. He was appointed by the King who thought that because of his previous experience and competent performance he would be suitable. However this was not the case and only five months later with his Government in chaos he was asked to resign. History has judged Frederick harshly because of this episode but there were very severe pressures on him at the time. There was a high level of discord between members of his own party which he found difficult to control. There was also a great deal of domestic pressure on him at the time which he found unbearable. His wife Sarah had proved to be an unsuitable partner for a high ranking politician as she was prone to outburst of hysteria and hypochondria. There exist letters written by Sarah's step aunt Emily Eden which frequently describes her niece's strange behaviour. In 1826 she said: The aunt also felt that Frederick had a nervous disposition and was completely dominated by the hysterical behaviour of his wife. It is these character traits that may have made him such an unsuitable Prime Minister even though he was a competent politician in lower offices. After he resigned as Prime Minister, one of his colleagues remarked that he was \\"quite another man who sleeps at nights now, and laughs and talks as usual\\". The couple had only one child who survived to adulthood. This was George Frederick Samuel Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon. On Frederick's death in 1859 he inherited Nocton Hall. George and Henrietta Robinson, 1st Marquess and Marchioness of Ripon George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon Henrietta, 1st Marchioness of Ripon George Frederick Samuel Robinson was born in 1827 in 10 Downing Street when his father was Prime Minister. A large part of his childhood was spent at Nocton Hall where he obtained much of his education. He was a prolific reader which helped him obtain the knowledge he required. In 1851 he married Henrietta Vyner who was his first cousin once removed. Henrietta was the daughter of Captain Henry Vyner of Newby Hall near Ripon. In 1859 after his father‚Äôs death he succeeded the title of Earl of Ripon. In November of the same year he gained the title of his uncle, Earl de Grey as his uncle had no male heirs. He also inherited from Earl de Grey his ancestral home of Studley Royal in Yorkshire. He was undersecretary for war in 1859‚Äì61 and for India in 1861‚Äì63. He became Prime Minister Lord Palmerston‚Äôs secretary for war in 1863, and in 1866 was appointed secretary of state for India. One of his most important position was as Viceroy of India in 1880 where he is said to have introduced liberal reforms. According to one historical account: ‚ÄúHe lit the torch that led ultimately to the political autonomy of the country\\". According to the Quarterly Review Ripon had industriously scattered the germs of independence in India with the doctrine that \\"the natives were entitled to rule, the English nothing more than interlopers; the time had arrived when India was entitled to ‚ÄòHome Rule‚Äô. After he returned from India he spent more of his time at his other home Studley Royal and he decided to sell Nocton Hall in 1889. The buyer was a close friend of his George Hodgson, a very wealthy industrialist. Residents of Nocton Hall after the Robinsons James Herbert Dennis circa 1920 George Hodgson, a wealthy spinner from Bradford moved into the Hall in 1889 and remained there until his death in 1895. His son John inherited the property and in 1902 upon John‚Äôs death his grandson Norman took control of the Estate. In 1917 after the United States' entry into the War the Hodgson family moved into Embsay House in the village, so that the Hall could be turned into a convalescent home for American officers wounded in the War. The last of these officers left in 1919.RAF Lincolnshire Information. Online reference In 1919 the Hall was sold to William Dennis of the firm Messrs W.H. Dennis and Sons, Kirton. On his death in 1925 his son James Herbert Dennis came to live at the property. James was a farmer and he converted a large part of the Estate to growing potatoes. He even had a special steam locomotive manufactured for the haulage of his potatoes. In 1940 with the outbreak of the Second World War it was originally taken over by the Army and was the home of 21st Casualty Clearing Station (CCS) RAMC until it was deployed in North Africa in June 1942. Sometime after this it was taken over by the Air Ministry, the Hall and grounds remaining as the site of an RAF hospital until its closure in 1983. In the mid 1980s Torrie Richardson bought Nocton Hall, the surrounding wood, woodland, grassland and cottages. Selling the cottages on for redevelopment allowed him to develop Nocton Hall as a Residential Home. Nocton Hall Residential home ran a summer f√™te for the village on their lawn and employed many local people. Torrie's son, Gary, took control of the business in the early 1990s. The home ran into difficulty and closed in the mid 1990s, and was sold by the receivers to new owners, Leda Properties of Oxford. Leda also bought the RAF Hospital site from the Ministry of Defence. The North aspect of Nocton Hall - October 2009 While vacant there were many break-ins; fireplaces and the stair bannisters were stolen. It burnt down for a second time in the early hours of 24 October 2004, the fire reducing it to a shell. The investigation into the fire established that multiple fires had been set, but to date no one has been charged with arson. Due to the extensive structural damage it will now likely need to be rebuilt, if the site is not redeveloped for another purpose. An adjacent geriatric nursing care two storey building has also been severely damaged by vandals since it was left vacant. In October 2009 Nocton Hall was included in the Victorian Society's list of the top ten endangered buildings in England and Wales. An investigation for BBC Look North established that Leda Properties intended to put forward new development plans in \\"the near future\\" for both the Hall and its associated gardens. As the Hall is Grade II listed and retains its major structural integrity the Society argued there was still a viable future for the building.

A battle scene from Tropaeum Traiani: a Roman legionnaire battles a Dacian warrior wielding a falx, while a Germanic warrior (Bastarnae?), sporting a Suebian knot, lies injured on the ground. The Suebian knot () is a historical male hairstyle ascribed to the tribe of the Germanic Suebi. The knot is attested by Tacitus in his 1st century AD work Germania, found on contemporary depictions of Germanic peoples, their art, and bog bodies. Germania Roman historian Tacitus reports in Germania (98 CE) that the Suebian warriors combed their hair back or sideways and tied it into a knot, allegedly with the purpose of appearing taller and more awe-inspiring on the battlefield. Tacitus also reports that the fashion had spread to neighboring Germanic tribes among the younger warriors, while among the Suebians, the knot was sported even by old men as a status symbol, which \\"distinguishes the freeman from the slave\\", with the most artful knots worn by the most wealthy nobles: Archaeological record A number of bog bodies have been found with hair dressed in Suebian knots: * Osterby Man, 70‚Äì220 AD of Osterby near Rendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany * D√§tgen Man,Datgen Man .

Method The hair is divided at the back in two uniform strands, slicked and laid in opposite directions around the head. On one side of the head, usually in the temporal region, the two strands are individually tightened in the same direction. The two strands are then twisted, whereby the rotation of the two individual strands loosens somewhat. A loop is formed from the resulting braid and the excess braid end is put in a loop through the loop. By natural untwisting the resulting knot tightens and stops without further aids.Schlabow: Haartracht und Pelzschulterkragen der Moorleiche von Osterby. The Osterby Man had an incipient vertex balding and very long and thin hair. Experimental archaeological wearing tests with this hairstyle showed that the node just as well holds only at very long and thin hair, as in the bog body.Haak: Einige Bemerkungen zum so genannten ‚ÄûSuebenknoten‚Äú.

The mask may also provide some protection from UV-light and some are treated with insect repellent.

Horses can see through the mesh with minimal impairment. Masks are often removed at night Most masks are made of black or white mesh, though some are colored, plaid or have silkscreened designs on them that do not interfere with vision. Fly masks are adjusted to cover the upper head and stop about halfway down the face, but the placement of stitched darts prevents the mask from rubbing on the eyes. Most have fleece padding around the muzzle and other sensitive areas. Masks come both with and without covers for the ears. Some designs have an extended flap that covers the muzzle but does not go around the lower jaw or interfere with grazing. Most attach with velcro, but a few high-end designs made with mesh and stretch lycra need to incorporate zippers instead. A standard fly mask is not generally used while riding, as the stiff mesh interferes with the bridle and the minimal visual impairment of the mesh still presents a safety issue. Other styles of insect protection gear are designed for use with a bridle. One design is a crochet-like \\"bonnet\\" for the ears only, designed to be worn under a bridle without rubbing. The other is a soft, very fine mesh face and nose-covering mask designed to be worn with a bridle and not impair vision, but not sturdy enough to withstand turnout. It is generally recommended that the mask be removed and inspected daily and washed frequently. Some individuals remove the mask at night. The appearance of fly masks often raises concerns among non-horse owners, as it appears that the horse has been blindfolded. However even a durable mesh is fine enough for the horse to see through.

Joseph Truman the elder inherited the Lolsworth Field brewery, William Bucknall's Brewhouse, in 1694, and took his son into partnership in 1716 before dying in 1719. Benjamin Truman joined the firm in 1722, and proved himself a shrewd businessman: :\\"On the birth of the Duchess of Brunswick, granddaughter of George II, in August 1737, the Prince of Wales ordered four loads of faggots and a number of tar barrels to be burnt before Carlton House to celebrate the event, and directed the brewer of his household to place four barrels of beer near the bonfire for the use of those who chose to partake of the beverage. The beer proved to be of inferior quality and the people threw it into each other's faces and the barrels into the fire. The prince remedied the matter on the following night by ordering a fresh quantity of beer from another brewer. This was supplied by Truman, who took care that it should be of the best, thus earning for himself considerable popularity\\".'Industries: Brewing', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2: General; Ashford, East Bedfont with Hatton, Feltham, Hampton with Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Laleham, Littleton (1911), pp. 168-78.

At the same time, he applied for a seat on the National Council of Slovenia. On 12 December 2012, the office commission refused his candidacy. In December 2012, the newspaper Dnevnik published an article regarding Kangler's degree from Doba Business College (), where he graduated in April 2008. Dnevnik showed that his thesis was plagiarized from articles published in the journal Lex localis. On 30 January 2013, the college's senate revoked his degree due to plagiarism.

Such a set is often called a spherical t-design to indicate the value of t, which is a fundamental parameter. The concept of a spherical design is due to Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel (1977), although these objects were understood as particular examples of cubature formulas earlier. Spherical designs can be of value in approximation theory, in statistics for experimental design, in combinatorics, and in geometry. The main problem is to find examples, given d and t, that are not too large; however, such examples may be hard to come by. Spherical t-designs have also recently been appropriated in quantum mechanics in the form of quantum t-designs with various applications to quantum information theory and quantum computing.  Existence of spherical designs  The existence and structure of spherical designs on the circle were studied in depth by Hong (1982). Shortly thereafter, Seymour and Zaslavsky (1984) proved that such designs exist of all sufficiently large sizes; that is, given positive integers n and t, there is a number N(d,t) such that for every N ‚â• N(d,t) there exists a spherical t-design of N points in dimension d. However, their proof gave no idea of how big N(d,t) is. Mimura constructively found conditions in terms of the number of points and the dimension which characterize exactly when spherical 2-designs exist. Maximally sized collections of equiangular lines (up to identification of lines as antipodal points on the sphere) are examples of minimal sized spherical 5-designs. There are many sporadic small spherical designs; many of them are related to finite group actions on the sphere. In 2013 Bondarenko, Radchenko, and Viazovska obtained the asymptotic upper bound N(d,t) for all positive integers d and t. This asymptotically matches the lower bound given originally by Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel. The value of Cd is currently unknown, while exact values of N(d,t) are known in relatively few cases.

Steve Adams, sometimes known as Stephen Adams, was a miner and member of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) in the early 1900s. Adams was named as an accomplice in several murders by Harry Orchard, who said that the murders were done at the orders of the WFM leadership. Adams was tried three times for murder, but was never convicted. Adans played a role in events surrounding the murder trials of Western Federation of Miners (WFM) leaders Bill Haywood, Charles Moyer, and George Pettibone, all charged with conspiring to murder former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg, allegedly in retaliation of the governor's role in the miner uprising in Coeur d'Alene. The investigations were led by famed Pinkerton agent James McParland. As a witness for the state who recanted, Adams is particularly notable for his comments about the methods used by agent McParland to turn defendants against each other. The Haywood trial McParland had WFM member Harry Orchard in custody, and had obtained an elaborate confession. However, McParland knew that he needed more than the confession of one man to convict Bill Haywood, who was being tried first among the trio of WFM leaders.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 101. Steve Adams was \\"a thirty-nine-year-old former Kansas City butcher and Cripple Creek miner with heavy, drooping eyelids and a booze-blotched complexion.\\"Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 102. Harry Orchard had described Adams as an accomplice in several crimes. As in the cases of Haywood, Moyer, and Pettibone, McParland relied upon a perjured warrant to cross state lines and grab Adams. The prisoner wasn't charged with any crime, but was held at the penitentiary in Idaho with Orchard. This was not according to McParland's plans: > If arrested, Adams was supposed to be kept in a separate cell away from > Orchard as McParland explicitly spelled out to the warden. To prime a man > for confessing, McParland required solitary confinement, a penetrating > silence, the watchful presence of a stony guard, and as few contacts as > possible. Adams was to be denied access to an attorney, knowledge of his > wife and children, and no information on the charges against him.The Corpse > On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, > page 11. Together in the cell, Orchard described his own confession to Adams, and urged Adams to also confess. In spite of the missed instruction about isolation, McParland reportedly later obtained such a confession from Adams. Although Steve Adams wasn't allowed to know anything about his wife and children, they weren't far away: > His wife, Annie, and their small children had also been locked in the > penitentiary shortly after his arrest for \\"their own protection,\\" McParland > had assured him, hinting that something dreadful might befall them.The > Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy > Martin, 2004, page 15. Adams' family was brought to the prison \\"as a means to 'sweat' him.\\"The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 275. =Clarence Darrow intervenes= However, Haywood defense attorney Clarence Darrow passed the word that he would defend Adams, and the prisoner immediately recanted. This provoked the prosecution to try Adams in an old murder case for which there was only flimsy evidence. In fact the only significant evidence against Adams was his now-repudiated confessionRoughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 103. which appeared to have been coerced, as Harry Orchard's confession was coerced.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 89-92. The difference appeared to be that there was clear evidence of Orchard's guilt in the Steunenberg murder,Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 87. and perhaps in a string of crimes, but little or no evidence linking the others. Adams had been dining well and provided with fine cigars since signing his confession, as had Harry Orchard. The note announcing that Adams recanted that confession was passed secretly from his jail cell via his wife, Annie, during a visit. The note \\"delivered a lightning bolt\\" to the prosecution.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 283, citing Miners' Magazine, September 13, 1906. It declared, > This is to certify that the statement that I signed was made up by James > McParland, detective, and Harry Orchard, alias Tom Hogan. I signed it > because I was threatened by Governor Gooding, saying I would be hanged if I > did not corroborate Orchard's story against the officers of the federation > union of miners. Stephen Adams. Witness: Annie Adams. Because under Idaho law the testimony of an accomplice must be corroborated by other evidence, the prosecution was counting on Adams' testimony to back up Orchard's confession. Adams' renunciation of his confession greatly weakened the prosecution's case against Haywood, who was found not guilty of the Steunenberg assassination. Pettibone was later also found not guilty in a separate trial. Moyer was released. Harry Orchard pled guilty of the murder of Frank Steunenberg and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted. Orchard would spend the rest of his life in prison. Some believed that the WFM would retaliate with violence against its enemies in the court cases. This belief was strengthened between the Haywood and Adams trials when ex-sheriff Harvey Brown, who had arrested Adams, was killed by a bomb set to explode when he opened his front gate - very similar to the setup Harry Orchard used to assassinate ex-governor Steunenberg. Another prospective witness in the Adams trial, Archie Phillips, found ten pounds of dynamite behind his house, and fled to Canada to avoid testifying. A number of other prosecution witnesses disappeared or put themselves out of reach of subpoenas.Beau Riffenburgh, Pinkerton's Great Detective (New York: Penguin, 1913) 341. =Steve Adams testifies= Adams took the witness stand in his own murder trial and testified, in part, > I was taken to the office of the penitentiary and introduced to detective > McParland. He told me about \\"Kelly the Bum\\" [from McParland's Molly Maguires > case] and other men who had turned state's evidence and had been set free. > ... McParland told me he wanted to convict [WFM leaders] Moyer, Haywood, > Pettibone, St. John, and Simpkins, whom he called 'cut-throats.' If I did > not help to convict them, he said, I would be taken back to Colorado and > either hanged or mobbed. If I did help, I would only be taken to Colorado as > a witness. ... When the confession was made, McParland led me on a step-by- > step and showed me all they wanted me to say. ... He wanted the names of the > officers of the Federation used as much as possible all through the > confession.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, > 1983, pages 103-104. McParland's own reports to Idaho Governor Gooding confirm Steve Adams' courtroom statements. Adams described how information from the question and answer session with McParland, with the Pinkerton detective guiding him from \\"notes in his pocket,\\" had been typed and returned to him in the form of a narrative document which he was required to sign. The narrative was written in a form that was not consistent with Adams' manner of speech. The document ended with, \\"I hope that the reign of terror inaugurated by Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone...will cease.\\"The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 285. Adams also claimed that Orchard had colluded with McParland to rewrite his own confession because \\"he could not repeat it the second time anything at all like the first one.\\"All That Glitters -- Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 228. However, Fremont Wood, the presiding judge in both the Haywood and Pettibone trials, was highly impressed by the way Orchard held up under prolonged and severe cross-examination in each trial, and believed Orchard's testimony to be true. In Wood's experience, no one could have fabricated such a convoluted story, covering many years, in many locations, and including so many different people, and withstand such thorough cross- examination without materially contradicting himself.Fremont Wood, The Introductory Chapter to the History of the Trials of Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone, and Harry Orchard (Caldwell, Ida.: Caxton, 1931) 35-36. It was L.J. \\"Jack\\" Simpkins, also known as J. Simmons, who accompanied Harry Orchard to Caldwell, but left before former governor Stuenenberg was assassinated. Simpkins was the WFM executive board member with responsibility for Idaho. The Pinkerton Agency produced a poster offering a two thousand dollar reward for his arrest, but \\"some skeptics believed that he was actually a Pinkerton agent provocateur.\\"Big Trouble, J. Anthony Lukas, 1997, photo caption between pages 224-225, page 293. and pages 557-558. The allegations appear to have been unfounded. At one point in the trial of Bill Haywood, McParland thought to frighten Moyer into testifying against Haywood and Pettibone by alleging that Pettibone had urged Orchard and Adams to kill Moyer. The plan was not carried out because McParland came up with an alternative plan.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 107. But the alternative scheme failed when Moyer refused to accept the bait.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 118. =Results of the trials= Adams was not found guilty of the murder. He was tried three times altogether, and both trials in Idaho ended in hung juries.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 141. Yet he would still face a trial for his life in Colorado. In the Colorado trial of Steve Adams, attorney Orrin N. Hilton challenged the legality of Adams' confession. McParland testified, and so did the Pinkerton stenographer who took down the confession. The stenographer admitted that McParland directed him what to take down, and what to leave out. The stenographer also confirmed that the confession was not written in language attributable to the defendant, and that sometimes \\"the substance of the conversation\\" was added in at a later time. The judge considered the issue overnight. In court the next day, he cited McParland's own testimony about the threat of hanging, and the promise of reward -- freedom in return for a confession -- which McParland routinely used in obtaining confessions. The judge ruled that the confession was gained illicitly, and the confession itself was barred. The judge ruled, however, that witnesses could attest to what Steve Adams had admitted in their presence. The information provided by the witnesses was contradictory, incomplete, and in some cases appeared to come from newspaper accounts.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 289-292, and 294. In fact, Steve Adams had been accused of involvement in two murders in Colorado, one of which never happened. In her research for the book The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin uncovered an elaborate scheme by mine owners and their supporters to blame the Telluride, Colorado, local of the Western Federation of Miners with a string of murders for which there was no evidence. Newspapers printed articles about how the murders allegedly occurred, and named union officials who had committed the crimes. The mine owners, the local sheriff, and James McParland of the Pinkerton Agency used the accusations of murder to publicize an alleged \\"reign of terror\\" as a means of destroying the union. One allegedly deceased victim, William J. Barney, was a mine guard who simply had disappeared from his job. In spite of elaborate and detailed chronologies of the murder that were printed in the local newspapers, Barney was still alive.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 10-24. However, this fact wasn't known to the jury sitting in judgment of Steve Adams. Even so, it wasn't long before the jury decided that testimony by Bulkeley Wells, manager of the Smuggler- Union Mining Company, who had sought the conviction and execution of Western Federation of Miners leaders for years, was not credible. Wells had constructed a scenario under which Steve Adams committed the murder with a shotgun. The jury, mostly area farmers, were intimately familiar with shotguns. The murder scenario, in their judgment, was impossible. The jury deliberated for an hour before taking a straw poll. They were unanimous; the defendant was not guilty. After three years in prison, Steve Adams was set free.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 293-305.

The poppet valves are controlled by the rotating camshaft at the top. High pressure steam enters, red, and exhausts, yellow. The uniflow type of steam engine uses steam that flows in one direction only in each half of the cylinder. Thermal efficiency is increased by having a temperature gradient along the cylinder. Steam always enters at the hot ends of the cylinder and exhausts through ports at the cooler centre. By this means, the relative heating and cooling of the cylinder walls is reduced.  Design details  Galloway uniflow steam engine, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum Steam entry is usually controlled by poppet valves (which act similarly to those used in internal combustion engines) that are operated by a camshaft. The inlet valves open to admit steam when minimum expansion volume has been reached at the start of the stroke. For a period of the crank cycle, steam is admitted, and the poppet inlet is then closed, allowing continued expansion of the steam during the stroke, driving the piston. Near the end of the stroke, the piston will uncover a ring of exhaust ports mounted radially around the centre of the cylinder. These ports are connected by a manifold and piping to the condenser, lowering the pressure in the chamber below that of the atmosphere causing rapid exhausting. Continued rotation of the crank moves the piston. From the animation, the features of a uniflow engine can be seen, with a large piston almost half the length of the cylinder, poppet inlet valves at either end, a camshaft (whose motion is derived from that of the driveshaft) and a central ring of exhaust ports. = Advantages = Uniflow engines potentially allow greater expansion in a single cylinder without the relatively cool exhaust steam flowing across the hot end of the working cylinder and steam ports of a conventional \\"counterflow\\" steam engine during the exhaust stroke. This condition allows higher thermal efficiency. The exhaust ports are only open for a small fraction of the piston stroke, with the exhaust ports closed just after the piston begins traveling toward the admission end of the cylinder. The steam remaining within the cylinder after the exhaust ports are closed is trapped, and this trapped steam is compressed by the returning piston. This is thermodynamically desirable as it preheats the hot end of the cylinder before the admission of steam. However, the risk of excessive compression often results in small auxiliary exhaust ports being included at the cylinder heads. Such a design is called a semi-uniflow engine. Engines of this type usually have multiple cylinders in an in-line arrangement, and may be single- or double-acting. A particular advantage of this type is that the valves may be operated by the effect of multiple camshafts, and by changing the relative phase of these camshafts, the amount of steam admitted may be increased for high torque at low speed, and may be decreased at cruising speed for economy of operation. Alternatively, designs using a more-complex cam surface allowed the varying of timing by shifting the entire camshaft longitudinally compared to its follower, allowing the admission timing to be varied. (The camshaft could be shifted by mechanical or hydraulic devices.) And, by changing the absolute phase, the engine's direction of rotation may be changed. The uniflow design also maintains a constant temperature gradient through the cylinder, avoiding passing hot and cold steam through the same end of the cylinder. = Disadvantages = In practice, the uniflow engine has a number of operational shortcomings. The large expansion ratio requires a large cylinder volume. To gain the maximum potential work from the engine a high reciprocation rate is required, typically 80% faster than a double-acting counterflow type engine. This causes the opening times of the inlet valves to be very short, putting great strain on a delicate mechanical part. In order to withstand the huge mechanical forces encountered, engines have to be heavily built and a large flywheel is required to smooth out the variations in torque as the steam pressure rapidly rises and falls in the cylinder. Because there is a thermal gradient across the cylinder, the metal of the wall expands to different extents. This requires the cylinder bore to be machined wider in the cool center than at the hot ends. If the cylinder is not heated correctly, or if water enters, the delicate balance can be upset causing seizure mid-stroke or, potentially, destruction.  History  The uniflow engine was first used in Britain in 1827 by Jacob Perkins and was patented in 1885 by Leonard Jennett Todd. It was popularised by German engineer Johann Stumpf in 1909, with the first commercial stationary engine produced a year previously in 1908. = Steam locomotives = The uniflow principle was mainly used for industrial power generation, but was also tried in a few railway locomotives in England, such as the North Eastern Railway uniflow locomotives No 825 of 1913, and No 2212 of 1919,The Museum of Retro Technology ‚Äì Uniflow Steam Locomotives. Retrieved 2010-08-07. and the Midland Railway Paget locomotive. Experiments were also made in France, Germany, the United States and Russia. In no case were the results encouraging enough for further development to be undertaken. = Steam wagons = The first large-scale utilization of a Uniflow engine was in Atkinson steam wagons, in 1918.Commercial Motor. 1918-08-15. = Skinner Unaflow = The final commercial evolution of the uniflow engine occurred in the United States during the late 1930s and 1940s by the Skinner Engine Company with the development of the Compound Unaflow Marine Steam Engine. This engine operates in a steeple compound configuration and provides efficiencies approaching contemporary diesels. Many car ferries on the Great Lakes were so equipped, one of which is still operating, of 1952. The , the most prolific aircraft carrier design in history, used two 5-cylinder Skinner Unaflow engines, but these were not steeple compounds. A non-compound Skinner Uniflow remained in service until 2013 in the Great Lakes cement carrier , installed when the vessel was re-powered in 1950. In small sizes (less than about ), reciprocating steam engines are much more efficient than steam turbines. White Cliffs Solar Power Station used a three-cylinder uniflow engine with \\"Bash\\"-type admission valves to generate about 25 kW electrical output. = Home-made conversions of two-stroke engines = The single-acting uniflow steam engine configuration closely resembles that of a two-stroke internal combustion engine, and it is possible to convert a two-stroke engine to a uniflow steam engine by feeding the cylinder with steam via a \\"bash valve\\" fitted in place of the spark plug.Bash Valve - description As the rising piston nears the top of its stroke, it knocks open the bash valve to admit a pulse of steam. The valve closes automatically as the piston descends, and the steam is exhausted through the existing cylinder porting. The inertia of the flywheel then carries the piston back to the top of its stroke against the compression, as it does in the original form of the engine. Also like the original, the conversion is not self-starting and must be turned over by an external power source to start. An example of such a conversion is the steam- powered moped, which is started by pedalling.Steam-powered moped  See also  * Advanced steam technology References Sources * Teach yourself heat engines by E. de Ville, published by The English Universities Press Limited, London, 1960, pp 40‚Äì41 External links * The Museum of Retro Technology ‚Äì Uniflow Steam Engines Steam engines Piston engines Engine technology History of the steam engine ","title":"Uniflow steam engine"},{"id":"9730343","text":"Valentino Martin Pascucci (born November 17, 1978 in Bellflower, California) is a former professional baseball player and current hitting coach for the Binghamton Rumble Ponies.

This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity. A characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a \\"scientific\\" (\\"wissenschaftlich\\") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments. The concept of a Viennese \\"school\\" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kram√°≈ô in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by Otto Benesch in 1920 and by Julius von Schlosser in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.  History  =Pragmatic art history= Rudolf Eitelberger is considered to have been the \\"forefather\\" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the Vorm√§rz, and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture. The first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was Moritz Thausing, who in 1879 became the second Ordinarius (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from aesthetics. =Formalist art history= Thausing's students Franz Wickhoff (Professor 1891) and Alois Riegl (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of late antiquity, which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of positivism, focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation. =Idealist art history= After the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art- historical positions at the University was filled by Max Dvo≈ô√°k, who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvo≈ô√°k's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvo≈ô√°k, in part influenced by the contemporary expressionist movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of Mannerism. Dvo≈ô√°k's idealistic method, which would later be termed \\"Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte\\" (\\"art history as intellectual history\\"), found its most committed champions in Hans Tietze and Otto Benesch. =Structuralist art history= Dvo≈ô√°k also died young, and in 1922 Julius von Schlosser was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce and of Karl Vossler, a Munich-based professor of the Romance languages, under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the \\"Stilgeschichte\\" (\\"style-history\\") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the \\"Sprachgeschichte\\" (\\"language-history\\") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides Ernst Gombrich, were Hans Sedlmayr and Otto P√§cht, who in the 1930s founded art-historical \\"structuralism.\\" Their methodology was described by Meyer Schapiro as the \\"New Vienna School\\"; it has also been described as the \\"Second Vienna School.\\" =Ideological art history= Josef Strzygowski, who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvo≈ô√°k, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original \\"Nordic\\" character, which was superior to the \\"Mediterranean.\\" As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the \\"orthodox\\" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the \\"arch-humanist\\" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the \\"Attila of art history.\\" The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of \\"Planforschung,\\" which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely \\"Nordic,\\" was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School. =Synthesis= The era of Nazism signified a turning point for the Vienna School.Hans Aurenhammer, \\"Z√§sur oder Kontinuit√§t? Das Wiener Kunsthistorische Institut im St√§ndestaat und im Nationalsozialismus.\\" In Wiener Schule. Erinnerung und Perspektiven (Wiener Jahrbuch f√ºr Kunstgeschichte, 53). Vienna, Cologne and Weimar 2004, pp. 11-54. Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methodological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. Hans Sedlmayr, a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, Karl Maria Swoboda assumed leadership of the Insitut, where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two Ordinarius positions were once more created, and were filled by Otto P√§cht (a student of Schlosser) and Otto Demus (a student of Strzygowski). Under the \\"two Ottos\\" Vienna became a \\"Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte\\" (\\"a mecca for medieval art history\\"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of Fritz Novotny. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.

It is a classic \\"big box\\" illusion that involves an assistant in a cabinet and is probably best categorised as a restoration-type illusion. Description The performance begins with the magician being joined by a spectator (who might be an audience member or the host of a show of which this illusion is a part). A large upright cabinet is presented. It is just large enough to contain a person and has a stylised sillouette of a woman on the front. A female assistant is introduced. It is explained that the box divides into four sections, as indicated by lines on its front, and the assistant will be cut into four pieces. The box is opened and the assistant steps inside. She crouches down to show the individual sections of the box are apparently too small to hold her. She then stands up again and her wrists are tied to cords within the top sections of the box. It is pointed out that the only way she can move out of position would be to untie herself with her teeth and then re- tie herself at the end of the trick. The box is closed up and blades are inserted to divide it into four sections as indicated by the lines on the front. The top sections are then hinged downwards so that all four sections are resting on the ground. The bottom sections are also hinged apart‚Äîso the result is the four sections appear to be separated although they remain connected at their edges by hinges. The magician then brings out two swords. He thrusts one sword into a couple of the boxes and invites the spectator to thrust the other sword into the remaining sections. The box is then re- assembled and the blades are removed. The box is then hinged apart to show the girl safe and well and still tied up inside. History The history of this illusion is vague and not well documented and it is sometimes confused with other Harbin illusions including the Jigsaw Lady. However a number of pictures exist showing different performances. One performance in January 1972 involved The Vernon Sisters singing group as assistants. A brief glimpse of another performance is seen in the British television documentary Heroes of Magic.Heroes of Magic was broadcast on Channel 4 in 2000, however the clip of the illusion clearly dates from earlier decades. A still from this broadcast is featured on this page. Footnotes Bibliography * R. Harbin, The Harbin Book, pub. M. Breese (1983), * R.

During his lifetime he was seen as being a good and virtuous man, who ruled justly and with strength. The country was at peace during his time in office, and he was well-read, an ardent student. Moromichi was an opponent of the system of cloistered rule began by Emperor Go-Sanj≈ç. He was hostile to the cloistered emperor himself, Shirakawa and the class of lesser aristocrats, 'new men', who supported him. The titular emperor, Horikawa, was joined with Moromichi in this opposition. Notably, Moromichi took action against the monks who at that time terrorised the Court in the name of their gods and spirits. They came down from the mountains, where their temples were situated, in armed bands and invaded the capital. No previous Regent or other statesman had possessed the courage to oppose them - Moromichi was the first to take action. Death Due to his opposing the monks, a legend developed around Moromichi's fatal illness. A Shinto ritualist had cursed him in front of an icon, and it was believed that Moromichi dreaded this curse so much that boils broke out on his skin. Though they briefly disappeared, they returned and this time killed him. After his death it was said that groans could be heard from beneath a stone, midway between the Ikuta Shrine and Hachi≈çji.

The Lost Tomb of Jesus is a documentary co-produced and first broadcast on the Discovery Channel and Vision TV in Canada on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the Talpiot Tomb. It was directed by Canadian documentary and film maker Simcha Jacobovici and produced by Felix Golubev and Ric Esther Bienstock, while James Cameron served as executive producer. (Jacobovici and Cameron had previously created The Exodus Decoded.) The film was released in conjunction with a book about the same subject, The Jesus Family Tomb, issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and Charles R. Pellegrino. The documentary and the book's claims have been rejected by many leading experts within the archaeological and theological fields, as well as among linguistic and biblical scholars. Content The film describes the finding of the Talpiot Tomb during a housing construction project, and posits that it was the family tomb of Jesus. The film states that ten ossuaries were found in the cave, of which six are the subject of the film. Further, it claims that one of the ten ossuaries went missing years ago, presumably stolen. The excavation report for the predecessor of the Israel Antiquities Authority was written by Amos Kloner, a professor of archaeology at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. Kloner dissociated himself from the claims made in the documentary. He said it was incorrect to call it \\"never before reported information\\" and that he had published all the details in the journal Antiqot in 1996. He had not said it was the tomb of Jesus' family.\\"'Jesus Tomb' Filmmakers Should Be Ashamed, Archeologist Says\\" \\"I think it is very unserious [sic] work.

Religious Scholar Provides Insight On The Controversy As translated in The Lost Tomb of Jesus and The Jesus Family Tomb, they read as follows: * Yeshua bar Yehosef' -- Aramaic for \\"Jesus son of Joseph\\" * Maria‚Äîwritten in Aramaic script, but a Latin form of the Hebrew name \\"Miriam\\" (\\"Mary\\") * Yose‚Äîa diminutive of \\"Joseph\\" mentioned (in its Greek form ŒπœâœÉŒ∑œÇ \\"Joses\\") as the name of one of Jesus's brothers in the New Testament () * Yehuda bar Yeshua‚Äîpossibly Aramaic for \\"Judah son of Jesus\\" * Mariamene e Mara‚Äîaccording to the filmmakers this is Greek for \\"Mary known as the master.\\" The similar name \\"Mariamne\\" is found in the Acts of Philip. Francois Bovon, professor of the history of religion at Harvard University has said, based on his study of that work, \\"I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam.\\"Letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, March 2007 * Matya‚ÄîHebrew for 'Matthew'‚Äînot claimed to be Matthew the Evangelist but \\"possibly a husband of one of the women in an unmarked ossuary.\\" The filmmakers claim that there is evidence that Mary mother of Jesus had many relatives named Matthew. The film further claims that the tenth ossuary, which went missing years ago, is the James Ossuary purported to contain the body of James, the brother of Jesus. In The Jesus Family Tomb, Simcha Jacobovici claims the James Ossuary would have been a part of this tomb, but was removed by artifact dealers, and thus discovered separately (citation needed). The James Ossuary's authenticity has been called into question, and Oded Golan, one of its past owners, was charged with fraud in connection to the artifact, but exonerated on all counts of forgery. Ben Witherington III, who worked with Jacobovici on a Discovery Channel documentary on the James Ossuary, denies this connection on two grounds: *\\"The James Ossuary, according to the report of the antiquities dealer that Oded Golan got the ossuary from, said that the ossuary came from Silwan, not Talpiot, and had dirt in it that matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem.\\" *\\"Furthermore, Eusebius reports that the tomb marker for James's burial was close to where James was martyred near the temple mount, indeed near the famous tombs in the Kidron Valley such as the so-called Tomb of Absalom. Talpiot is nowhere near this locale.\\" Another consideration was that the measurements of the James Ossuary did not match the measurements listed for the tenth ossuary, which is no longer stored with the rest of the collection. The James Ossuary was listed as being approximately 50 centimeters (19.6 inches) long by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) wide on one end, and 25.5 centimeters (10 inches) on the other end (citation needed). The tenth ossuary in the Talpiot collection is listed as 60 centimeters (23.6 inches) long by 26 centimeters (10.2 inches) by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) (citation needed). Furthermore, Amos Kloner has stated that the tenth ossuary had no inscription. Also, Joe Zias, former curator of the Rockefeller Museum who received and catalogued the ossuaries, refuted this claim on his personal site (citation needed). New information has now shown that the discrepancy in the measurements had to do with measuring the base of the ossuary, which is indeed 50 centimeters (19.6 inches), rather than the length. The top length of the James Ossuary, not the base, which is trapezoidal in shape, according to the latest re-measurement carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority, is 57.5 centimeters (22.6 inches.) (citation needed). While compelling, this does not prove that the James Ossuary is the missing tenth Talpiot ossuary. DNA tests Analysis of mitochondrial DNA performed by Lakehead University on the remains found in the ossuary marked \\"Jesus son of Joseph\\" and the one marked \\"Mariamne\\" or \\"Mary\\" (who some claim to be Mary Magdalene) found that the two occupants were not blood relations on their mothers' side. Based on these tests, the makers of the documentary suggest that \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Mariamne\\" were probably married \\"because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb,\\" but the remains were not dated using radiocarbon to further sustain this supposition, neither was any announced DNA testing done on the others ossuaries to see if any familial relation existed there. Additionally, scholars argue the DNA tests only prove that they did not have the same mother and they could easily have been father/daughter, cousins, half brother/sister, or any number of possibilities that do not include a matrilineage line.Society of Biblical Literature New views of Jesus endorsed by the film =Christian views= The film proposes new interpretations of the events regarding Jesus depicted in the New Testament, as seen by mainstream Christianity. The film's suggestions contradict the basis of the faith\\"The identification of the Talpiot tomb as the tomb of Jesus and his family contradicts the canonical Gospel accounts of the death and burial of Jesus and the earliest Christian traditions about Jesus.\\"‚Äî and may be considered blasphemous by Christians:\\"For some Christians that [Jesus bones in an ossuary] would be heresy and blasphemy and wrong, and for others I don't think it's going to be a big shock. They have a faith that doesn't necessarily depend on that.\\"‚ÄîRoy Fuller, Indiana University Southeast‚Äî * Jesus remains found (see Death and resurrection of Jesus, Nicene Creed) ** Presumably only spiritual ascension, not a bodily ascension (see Hypostatic union, resurrecting Lazarus) * Mary remains found (see Assumption of Mary, Dormition of the Theotokos) * Jesus being married (see Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)) * Jesus having a child (see Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)) * Jesus having brothers and/or sisters (see the discussion about Jesus' siblings) ** Presumably Mary not being virgin (see the perpetual virginity of Mary) *New tomb of Jesus (see Church of the Holy Sepulchre) ** Presumably Jesus body being moved (see Empty tomb) *Ordaining women (see apostolic succession, Ordination, Ordination of women) * Appeal to sources not included in the Biblical canon, of Gnostic origin, such as the Gospel of Mary Magdalene or Acts of Philip, considered by scholars to be written later (see Origin of the canonical Gospels, dating of canonical Gospels, New Testament apocrypha) The claim that Jesus was married also undermines the theological metaphor of the Church being the \\"Bride of Christ\\" (found in the writings of the New Testament). Jimmy Akin, director of Apologetics and Evangelization at Catholic Answers, wrote: \\"This image would never have arisen if there was a Mrs. Jesus living right there in Jerusalem‚Ä¶. We know about [the wives of religion founders] because they were honored figures as wives of The Founder, and if Jesus had a wife then (a) we would know about it and (b) the whole Church-as-the-Bride-of-Christ metaphor would never have come into existence.\\" As for a possible \\"son of Jesus,\\" he noted: \\"We tend to know about even the daughters of religious founders. Muhammad's daughter Fatima comes to mind. It would be much harder to sneak a forgotten son by the eyes of history‚Ä¶. It's not just hard to sneak sons past because patriarchal cultures focus more on sons; it's also because of this: In traditional societies, the son is looked on as the father's natural successor.\\" The filmmakers denied that the claims made in the film contradicted key teachings of Christianity, such as the resurrection and ascension. The film's religious consultant James Tabor stated that the fact that Jesus' tomb was discovered does not put in doubt biblical accounts of his resurrection, which he said could have been spiritual. With regard to the ascension, the documentary's website suggests that while the tomb's discovery does not render impossible the notion of a spiritual ascension, it does contradict the belief that Jesus physically ascended to heaven. =Islamic views= Finding someone's remains in Jesus' tomb conforms to the Muslim belief that a substitute for him was crucified, while he was raised bodily to heaven. The Islamic view of his disappearance, as mentioned in the Qur'an, states: That they said (in boast), \\"We killed Al-Masih 'Isa the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah\\"; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them. The general Muslim interpretation of the verse is that God, to revenge from Judas' betrayal to Jesus (the fatherless prophet), made his face similar to that of Jesus, while Jesus ascended into heaven and is to return near the end of time and kill the anti-Christ. Accordingly, the discovered remains in his tomb would then actually belong to Judas, a Roman guard, or a volunteering disciple. Reception Following the March 4, 2007, airing of The Lost Tomb of Jesus on the Discovery Channel, American journalist Ted Koppel aired a program entitled The Lost Tomb of Jesus‚ÄîA Critical Look, whose guests included the director Simcha Jacobovici, James Tabor, Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who served as a consultant and advisor on the documentary, Jonathan Reed, Professor of Religion at the University of LaVerne and co-author of Excavating Jesus Beneath the Stones, Behind the Text, and William Dever, an archaeologist with over 50 years experience in Middle Eastern archaeological digs. Alan Cooperman, writer of The Washington Post article also states this: \\"Similar assessments came yesterday from two Israeli scholars, Amos Kloner, who originally excavated the tomb, and Joe Zias, former curator of archaeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority. Kloner told the Jerusalem Post that the documentary is \\"nonsense.\\" Zias described it in an e-mail to The Washington Post as a \\"hyped up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest.\\" Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time. \\"I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family,\\" and \\"The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film.\\" he told the BBC News website.Jesus tomb found, says film- maker During the documentary The Lost Tomb of Jesus, various professionals had claimed: # concerning the ossuaries marked Yeshua\` (\\"Jesus\\") and the one believed to be that of Mary Magdalene: because \\"the DNA did not match, the forensic archaeologist concluded that they must be husband and wife\\"; # that testing showed that there was a match between the patina on the James and Yeshua\` ossuaries and referred to the James ossuary as the \\"missing link\\" from the tomb of Yeshua\` (Jesus); # and that an ossuary that became missing from the tomb of Yeshua\` had actually been the infamous James ossuary believed to contain the remains of the brother of Yeshua\`. During Ted Koppel's critique, The Lost Tomb of Jesus‚Äîa Critical Look, Koppel revealed he had denials from these three people that Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary. # Koppel had a written denial from the forensic archaeologist asserting that he had NOT concluded that the remains of Yeshua\` and Miriamne showed they were husband and wife. In fact, he had logically stated, \\"you cannot genetically test for marriage.\\" # Koppel had a written denial from the Suffolk Crime Lab Director (Robert Genna) asserting that he had NOT stated the James ossuary patina matched that of the Yeshua\` ossuary. He denied ever saying they were a match, and said he'd have to do much more comparison testing of other tombs before he could draw any conclusions.Quarles, Charles Buried Hope or Risen Savior B&H; Publishing Group, 2008 p17 # Koppel had a verbal denial from Professor Amos Kloner, the archaeologist who had supervised the initial 1980 dig of the tomb of Yeshua\`, with whom he spoke on 3/4/07, asserting that the ossuary that later turned up missing from the alleged Tomb of 'Jesus' could not have been what is now known as the James ossuary. In fact he indicated there was evidence that it was not the same by saying that the now missing ossuary he had seen and photographed and catalogued in 1980 had been totally unmarked, whereas the James ossuary is marked with the name of James and a rosette. The archaeologist William Dever summed it up when he stated on Koppel's critical analysis, The Lost Tomb of Jesus‚ÄîA Critical Look, that Jacobovici's and Cameron's \\"conclusions were already drawn in the beginning\\" of the inquiry and that their \\"argument goes far beyond any reasonable interpretation.\\"Quarles, Charles Buried Hope or Risen Savior B&H; Publishing Group, 2008 p.16 Archaeological questions =The three skulls= Three skulls were found on the floor of the tomb in 1980 which the film makers assert was usual but others disagree: \\"This too was decidedly not typical. In ancient Jerusalem, the dead were placed inside tombs; in tombs, the dead were placed inside ossuaries. If anything was left behind, it was a lamp or a bottle of perfume, not skulls.\\" Criticism of the documentary Early Christianity scholar R. Joseph Hoffmann, chair of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, says the film alerts the public to the fact that there are no secure conclusions when it comes to the foundational history of a religious tradition. But he charges that the film \\"is all about bad assumptions,\\" beginning with the assumption that the boxes contain Jesus of Nazareth and his family. From his view as a historian specializing in the social history of earliest Christianity, he found it \\"amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion‚Äîand a hammer.\\"\\"Who is Entombed in the 'Jesus Tomb'?\\" U.S. News, March 12, 2007, p. 34-35 When interviewed about the upcoming documentary, Amos Kloner, who oversaw the original archaeological dig of this tomb in 1980 said: :\\"It makes a great story for a TV film, but it's completely impossible. It's nonsense.\\" Newsweek reports that the archaeologist who personally numbered the ossuaries dismissed any potential connection: :\\"Simcha has no credibility whatsoever,\\" says Joe Zias, who was the curator for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. \\"He's pimping off the Bible ‚Ä¶ He got this guy Cameron, who made Titanic or something like that‚Äîwhat does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, but if I were to write a book about brain surgery, you would say, 'Who is this guy?' People want signs and wonders. Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession.\\"Have Researchers Found Jesus Christ's Tomb? - Newsweek Beliefs - MSNBC.com Zias was later successfully sued for libel by Jacobovici in an Israeli court. Pfann also thinks the inscription read as \\"Jesus\\" has been misread and suggests that the name \\"Hanun\\" might be a more accurate rendering. The Washington Post reports that William G. Dever (mentioned above as excavating ancient sites in Israel for 50 years) offered the following: :\\"I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story, because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction.\\" Asbury Theological Seminary's Ben Witherington III points out some other circumstantial problems with linking this tomb to Jesus' family: * \\"So far as we can tell, the earliest followers of Jesus never called Jesus 'son of Joseph'. It was outsiders who mistakenly called him that.\\" * \\"The ancestral home of Joseph was Bethlehem, and his adult home was Nazareth. The family was still in Nazareth after he [Joseph] was apparently dead and gone. Why in the world would he be buried (alone at this point) in Jerusalem?\\" * \\"One of the ossuaries has the name Jude son of Jesus. We have no historical evidence of such a son of Jesus, indeed we have no historical evidence he was ever married.\\" * \\"The Mary ossuaries (there are two) do not mention anyone from Migdal. It simply has the name Mary‚Äîand that's about the most common of all ancient Jewish female names.\\" * \\"We have names like Matthew on another ossuary, which don't match up with the list of [Jesus's] brothers' names.\\" The Archaeological Institute of America, self-described on their website as \\"North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archeology,\\" has published online their own criticism of the \\"Jesus tomb\\" claim: > \\"The identification of the Talpiyot tomb as the tomb of Jesus and his family > is based on a string of problematic and unsubstantiated claims [...] [It] > contradicts the canonical Gospel accounts of the death and burial of Jesus > and the earliest Christian traditions about Jesus. This claim is also > inconsistent with all of the available information‚Äîhistorical and > archaeological‚Äîabout how Jews in the time of Jesus buried their dead, and > specifically the evidence we have about poor, non-Judean families like that > of Jesus. It is a sensationalistic claim without any scientific basis or > support.\\"AIA News - Has the Tomb of Jesus Been Discovered? =DNA and family evidence= Darrell Bock, a New Testament scholar and research professor of New Testament studies at Dallas Theological Seminary points out some of the inconsistencies, including: \\"If Jesus' family came from Galilee, why would they have a family tomb in Jerusalem?\\" Ben Witherington points out an inconsistency related to the James Ossuary. He points out that the James Ossuary came from Silwan, not Talpiot. In addition, the James Ossuary had dirt on it that \\"matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem.\\" In his opinion, this is problematic, because \\"the ossuaries that came out of Talpiot came out of a rock cave from a different place, and without such soil in it.\\" Therefore, he believes that it is difficult to believe that the one known family member of Jesus was buried separately and far away from Jesus' family. In addition, during the trial of antiquities dealer Oded Golan there has been testimony from former FBI agent Gerald Richard that a photo of the James ossuary, showing it in Golan's home, was taken in the 1970s, based on tests done by the FBI photo lab. This would make it impossible for the James Ossuary to have been discovered with the rest of the Talpiot ossuaries in the 1980s. With reference to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: \\"[T]he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated‚Ä¶. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all.\\" This quote clarifies the fact that the documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the \\"Jesus son of Joseph\\" and the \\"Mariamne\\" in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. that they did not have the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary. The New York Times article of February 27, 2007, (reprinted in full on many websites) states: > The documentary's director and its driving force, Simcha Jacobovici‚Ä¶, said > there was enough mitochondrial DNA for a laboratory in Ontario to conclude > that the bodies in the \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Mary Magdalene\\" ossuaries were not > related on their mothers' side. From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they > were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in > a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers > did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the > one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the > Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually > the offspring of Mary. \\"We're not scientists. At the end of the day we can't > wait till every ossuary is tested for DNA,\\" he said. \\"We took the story that > far. At some point you have to say, I've done my job as a journalist.\\" In the televised debate following the airing of the film, Ted Koppel pressed Jacobovici on the same question and received the same response. According to the authors of one blog, \\"the response is manifestly disingenuous. The question, in fact, necessarily arises whether the team or one of its members decided not to proceed with any further DNA tests. Such tests may have revealed that none of the ossuaries are related‚Äîhence defeating the underlying presupposition that the crypt was in fact a family tomb, and thereby eliminating any valid basis at all for producing and showing the film.\\" William G. Dever said that some of the inscriptions on the ossuaries are unclear, but that all of the names are common. \\"I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction.\\" Jodi Magness, an archaeologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, notes that at the time of Jesus, wealthy families buried their dead in tombs cut by hand from solid rock, putting the bones in niches in the walls and then, later, transferring them to ossuaries. \\"If Jesus' family had been wealthy enough to afford a rock-cut tomb, it would have been in Nazareth, not Jerusalem,\\" Magness writes. According to Magness, the names on the Talpiot ossuaries indicate that the tomb belonged to a family from Judea, the area around Jerusalem, where people were known by their first name and father's name. As Galileans, Jesus and his family members would have used their first name and hometown. \\"This whole case (for the tomb of Jesus) is flawed from beginning to end.\\" There is no information on analyzing relation of \\"Mary\\" and \\"Jesus son of Joseph\\" or any other tomb occupants. In Jewish tradition of the time, after one year, when bodies in rock-cut tombs were decomposed, bones were collected, cleaned and then finally placed in an ossuary. Due to this conduct there is no real assurance that what scientists have really examined are remnants of \\"Mariamne e Mara\\" and \\"Jesus son of Joseph.\\" =Interpretation of the inscriptions= David Mavorah, a curator of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, points out that the names on the ossuaries were extremely common. \\"We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from there to say this is the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely.\\" David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the statistics section above. Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem district archaeologist of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the first archaeologist to examine the tomb in 1980, told the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the name Jesus had been found 71 times in burial caves at around that time. Furthermore, he said that the inscription on the ossuary is not clear enough to ascertain, and although the idea fails to hold up by archaeological standards it makes for profitable television. Quote: \\"The new evidence is not serious, and I do not accept that it is connected to the family of Jesus‚Ä¶. They just want to get money for it.\\" Richard Bauckham, professor at the University of St Andrews, catalogued ossuary names from that region since 1980. He records that based on the catalogue, \\"Jesus\\" was the 6th most popular name of Jewish men, and \\"Mary/Mariamne\\" was the single most popular name of Jewish women at that time. Therefore, finding two ossuaries containing the names \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Mary/Mariamne\\" is not significant at all, and the chances of it being the ossuaries of Jesus and Mary Magdalene are \\"very small indeed.\\" Concerning the inscription attributed to Jesus son of Joseph, Steve Caruso, a professional Aramaic translator using a computer to visualize different interpretations, claims that although it is possible to read it as \\"Yeshua\\" that \\"overall it is a very strong possibility that this inscription is not 'Yeshua\` bar Yehosef.'\\" The name \\"Mary\\" and its derivatives may have been used by up to 25% of Jewish women at that time.\\"The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Response to the Discovery- Channel Documentary Directed by James Cameron\\" =Publicity= Lawrence E. Stager, the Dorot professor of archaeology of Israel at Harvard, said the documentary was \\"exploiting the whole trend that caught on with The Da Vinci Code. One of the problems is there are so many biblically illiterate people around the world that they don't know what is real judicious assessment and what is what some of us in the field call 'fantastic archaeology.'\\" William G. Dever said, \\"I'm not a Christian. I'm not a believer. I don't have a dog in this fight. I just think it's a shame the way this story is being hyped and manipulated.\\" Jodi Magness criticized the decision of the documentary makers to make their claims at a news conference rather than in a peer-reviewed scientific article. By going directly to the media, she said, the filmmakers \\"have set it up as if it's a legitimate academic debate, when the vast majority of scholars who specialize in archeology of this period have flatly rejected this.\\" Joe Zias, former curator of archeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority, described it in an e-mail to The Washington Post as a \\"hyped-up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest.\\" He also wrote an extended Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb documentary, published on his web site. Fran√ßois Bovon has also written to say that his comments were misused. In a letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, he wrote: Symposium and media coverage Following a symposium at Princeton in January 2008 media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited. Time and CNN devoted extensive coverage, implying that the case had been re-opened. Scholars who had been present at the symposium then accused Jacobovici and Cameron of misleading the media in claiming the symposium reopened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including all the archaeologists and epigraphers, who delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are \\"nothing further from the truth\\".Duke University Religion Department: The Talpiot Tomb Controversy Revisited DVD editions On March 15, 2007, Discovery Channel released a DVD of the documentary with a listed running time of two hours.shopping.discovery.com See also * Death and resurrection of Jesus * Historical Jesus * New Testament view on Jesus' life References Published References  Further reading  *.

He received an undergraduate degree from Xi'an Communications University (Xi'an Jiaotong University), and attended Peking University from 1995 to 1998, receiving a Master's Degree in mechanics (Mechanical Engineering). Yang is also an amateur poet and has two known published poems, Peasants - My Kinsmen in 1998, and The Ghost of Communism in 2001, and is married to Lu Kun. Social activism In early 1997 whilst at Beijing University, he co-founded the Current Affairs Society, a student organization committed on discussion of social issues in China, which was banned several months later by school authorities. In 1999, Yang and some close friends started to meet regularly and formed the New Youth Society to discuss social and political issues.

He lives and works in Vienna.  Life and work In 2000 Fasching opened his project Westwerk (a western investigation of the occidental culture) in the more than 800 years old Vienna St. Stephan‚Äôs Cathedral. The project consisted of his sculptures, paintings and other work. A constantly recurring, central element in Fasching‚Äôs work is the creation of his pieces of art amidst his visitors and audience. There were 7 periods between 1987 and 2006 when, under the title 12 Tage 12 N√§chte/12 Days 12 Nights, Fasching lived and worked in various galleries around the world, where he could be observed at work and was always open to discussions. During this time he did not leave the place of work. Fasching created 12 paintings with themes inspired by the talks with the visitors to his work sessions. For each of the seven stations of the project [Vienna (1987), Amsterdam (1990), Cologne (1991), Zurich (1992), Jerusalem (1994), New York (1997) and finally Vienna again (2006)] a special soundtrack was composed, which was played in the respective gallery for the full 288 hours of the project. Fasching‚Äôs walk-in sculpture Der Hammer des Thors/Thor‚Äôs Hammer, created in 1990 in the entrance hall of the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts (Museum f√ºr Angewandte Kunst - MAK), also emerged before the eyes of the museum‚Äôs visitors, thus enabling them to follow the process of creation. A further walk-in sculpture was created by Bernd Fasching in the Dominican Republic between 1996 and 1997. Terra Nova, the title of this walk-in formation of sculptures, depicts the landing place of Christopher Columbus on the island as an incentive to reflect on the checkered, often terrible History of the American Continents. Based on these pieces, Fasching created the series Tools, making a sculpture of each of the tools required for sculpturing a monument. A bronze sculpture from this series, in the form of a spade, was revised by Fasching and turned into the Diva Award, an Austrian prize for sensational real-estate projects, which has been awarded annually ever since its creation in 2002, with Bernd Fasching himself as one of the jury members.

The program was hosted by Jimmy Tarbuck with voice overs by Rosemarie Ford. The show was inspired by (and produced by the team behind) the BBC's popular Big Break, which featured snooker (and in turn, was influenced by ITV's long-running darts quiz, Bullseye). However, unlike the long-running Big Break and Bullseye, Full Swing did not catch on and only ran for one series. Round 1: Three For The Tee The contestant's celebrity guests use a golf simulator of famous golf courses. The celeb swings ‚Äì the ball landing on the green or a hazard. The contestant is asked questions by cards. A correct answer gives a boost toward the pin. Whichever 2 pairs gets closest to the pin goes through to round 2; the one who gets the least is eliminated and wins a consolation prize through a bonus game called Crazy Consolation. Round 2: Fairway Or Foul In this round, the contestant answers a question to make the celeb hit the ball to the green, however, there are hazards. ‚Ä¢ bunkers or deep bunkers ‚Ä¢ river and waterfalls ‚Ä¢ rabbits digging holes There is a special golf hole that the ball only goes into if it is lit up; if it is not lit, it ejects the golf ball back onto the green. If it lands on any hazard, the contestant answers a hazard question ‚Äì if they get it right, Tarbuck places the ball on the green for the contestant to putt in to the hole, if they get it wrong get another chance. The winner was who putts the ball with the most remaining time or nearest to the pin. The losing contestant and their celebrity guest play a bonus round to win a cash consolation prize, called Celebrity Consolation. Round 3: The Final Green The contestant answers 4 general knowledge questions, getting them all right adds 40 seconds to the clock. Then a Bonus Ball is selected at random from a massive golf ball (similar to lottery machine). Each are numbered 10 to 60, and whichever one the contestant picks out, then it is added the time. The celebrity guest then had to putt 10 golf balls into a hole within the time the contestant had accumulated, with the money rising from ¬£100 to ¬£1,000. Sinking all the balls in the hole wins the ¬£1,000 jackpot, a holiday, if not they go away with the money they had won. Ratings The program aired on Saturdays in an early evening slot (similar to the Big Break slot) but was axed after just one series due to poor ratings. A Christmas Special was recorded but never broadcast, due to the disappointing reception of the first series ‚Äì a move that angered Tarbuck, who believed a slot over the festive period would have helped boost the show's reception by the public, and which saw him refuse to work for the BBC for several years after.

It was first established as a single betting shop in Ordsall, Salford, in 1967. Its turnover in 2004 was reported to be more than ¬£3.5 billion, having risen from ¬£550 million in 2003 and has continued to grow to over ¬£10 billion in 2018-2019. It has its head office is in Birchwood, Warrington, and also has offices in Media City, Salford Quays, Salford. Betfred.com, the company's online gambling site, is based in Gibraltar and registered as Petfre (Gibraltar) Limited. Betfred, Putney, London (2015)  History  Betfred, North End Road, Fulham, London (2015) Done Bookmakers was first established as a single shop in Ordsall, Salford in 1967. Fred Done financed the first Done Bookmakers shop with capital made from a winning bet he placed on England to win the 1966 World Cup. In 1997, Done Bookmakers acquired the Robert Walker chain of bookmakers, taking their total to one hundred shops. A mixture of organic and acquisition growth has resulted in Betfred being the largest independent retail bookmaker in the UK. By 2000, the total number of shops nationwide had risen to two hundred, and in 2002, Done Bookmakers opened their first shop in the Greater London area. The current name Betfred was first used in 2004. In 2004, Betfred also launched their digital platform Betfred.com and offer sports betting, online casino, online games, bingo, lotto, online poker and virtual sports as well as pool betting. In November 2004, a Betfred customer became the first betting shop millionaire; a customer known only as Ken selected six winners on the totescoop6 and pocketed ¬£1,132,657 in a Salford shop. Betfred's retail expansion continued with shops opening around the United Kingdom. Betfred's five-hundredth shop opened in Cardiff in 2005. In 2013, the company established Betfred TV, an in-house channel that is available in all shops both on the high street and on the racecourse. This was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. Fred Done was the first bookmaker to pay out early (i.e., before the result was guaranteed), when in March 1998 it paid out to gamblers who had bet that Manchester United F.C. would win the Premier League, only for Arsenal to pip United by one point. During the 2004‚Äì05 FA Premier League season, Done lost ¬£1m to fellow bookmaker Victor Chandler after staking that amount that Manchester United would finish higher than Chelsea. The bet was offered to other high profile bookmakers yet only Chandler took him up on the offer. Chelsea finished 18 points clear of third placed Manchester United and won their first Premiership title under Jos√© Mourinho. Betfred also paid out early on Manchester United to win the 2011‚Äì12 Premier League title, only for Manchester City to beat them on goal difference. It was widely reported in April 2010 that Fred Done formed part of the \\"Red Knights\\" consortium that were looking to buy English Premier League club Manchester United from the Glazer Family. The reports proved to be incorrect, but Done remained a season ticket holder at Old Trafford. As of July 2017, Betfred operated over 1,650 shops throughout the United Kingdom, after the purchase of 322 shops due to the merger between fellow bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral in October 2016. Betfred also operates shops on fifty one racecourses around the country, including Newmarket, Epsom and Cheltenham. In August 2017, Betfred appointed former Nottingham Forest and England footballer Stuart Pearce as its brand ambassador. The company believed Pearce to be the epitome of Betfred: uncomplicated. In September 2017, Betfred celebrated their fiftieth year of business. A documentary film about the history of the company was released on the official channel of Betfred on YouTube. In July 2018, Betfred won a court case against HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The ruling states that Betfred overpaid Value-Added Tax (VAT), and could see a ¬£100 million refund. In November 2018, punter David Smith took Betfred to court after he claimed to have won a jackpot of ¬£1.7 million, having mistakenly written \\"Bailarico\\", a losing horse, on the betting slip, rather than \\"Bialco\\", a winner. The betting arbitrator IBAS ruled against him.  Sponsorship  Betfred shop in Manchester (2011) = Horse racing = Betfred is one of the largest sponsors of horse racing in the United Kingdom, with races spread across racecourses in the country, including the Midlands National run at Uttoxeter Racecourse, the Dante Stakes and Ebor Handicap both at York Racecourse, and the Betfred Cesarewitch Handicap on the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. In 2005, Betfred became sponsors of the Group One Sprint Cup at Haydock Park. The race is run over the minimum distance of five furlongs. The sponsorship ended in 2016. Betfred also sponsored the most prestigious jumps race the Cheltenham Gold Cup between the years of 2012 and 2015. = Rugby league = In October 2016, Betfred began a three-year period as the main sponsor of rugby league's Super League, the northern hemisphere's top-level professional rugby league with ten teams spread across England, and one in France. = Snooker = Betfred sponsored the World Snooker Championships from 2009 to 2012, before losing the sponsorship rights. In 2015, it was announced that Betfred were to become the sponsors of the tournament once again, and increase the winner's prize money to ¬£375,000. = Football = Betfred was the official betting partner of Manchester United from 2006 to 2013. In May 2016, it was announced that Betfred would take over sponsorship of the Scottish League Cup for three years, rebranding it the Betfred Cup. In June 2017, Betfred was confirmed as the new official shirt sponsors of Championship side Bolton Wanderers, in an agreement which will initially last for two years. In June 2019, Betfred took over the shirt sponsorship rights for RCD Mallorca for the next two years.  The Tote  On 3 June 2011, Betfred won the auction to purchase The Tote, the government-owned betting operation, in a deal worth ¬£265m. The counter bid was lodged by the SIP (Sports Investment Partners) consortium headed by former city banker and British Airways chairman Sir Martin Broughton. Betfred pledged ¬£155m into racing over the next seven years, as well as creating the Tote Racing Development Board, giving greater say to industry figures. In September 2016, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \\"In terms of the Tote Racing Development Board, I can confirm that as a stand alone concept it has not been set up to date. Betfred has confirmed that Totepool work with race course owners and management on a continuing basis (which may serve the same purpose as the intended Tote racing development board).\\" The deal gave Betfred exclusive control over the on course betting system for seven years. In 2018, the exclusive licence taken out by Betfred officially ran out.  Regulatory action  In June 2016, the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) Commission required Betfred to pay more than ¬£800,000 in compensation and in contribution towards socially responsible causes as part of a regulatory settlement. This was in response to Betfred's failure to adhere to its anti money laundering and social responsibility policies. The Gambling Commission's investigation followed a court case, that resulted in one customer of Betfred being jailed for three years and four months, after admitting to stealing from his employer. A significant proportion of the stolen money was spent with Betfred. In April 2019, the Commission ordered Betfred and Paddy Power to terminate new betting products. This followed the introduction of reduced maximum stakes on fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTS) from ¬£100 to ¬£2. The Commission was \\"concerned that the new products undermine the changes made\\". The Guardian accused the companies of trying to circumvent the government's enforced FOBTs ¬£2 reduction, with their new games. Betfred's \\"Virtual Cycling\\" product offered customers the chance to wager up to ¬£500 per stake. Both Paddy Power and Betfred withdrew their games. UKGC said it was investigating the matter and that both bookmakers could \\"still face regulatory action\\", as it investigated \\"key senior staff at bookmakers who are responsible for bringing those products to market\\". In October 2019, the Commission ordered Petfre, Betfred's parent, to pay ¬£322,000 for money laundering failures. An investigation revealed the operator had failed to carry out adequate \\"source of funds\\" checks on a customer who deposited ¬£210,000, and lost ¬£140,000, of stolen money over one twelve-day period in November 2017. The Commission said that one customer who was able to deposit and lose such significant amounts in such a short period of time clearly indicated failings in the effectiveness of Petfre's anti money laundering policies and procedures.

Under SQPN branding, Vonh√∂gen produced a talk show called The Daily Breakfast (which won the 2006, 2007, and 2008 People's Choice Podcast Awards in the Religion category) and a series of podcasts called Secrets that gave Catholic commentary on media franchises such as Lost, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Indiana Jones. In 2018, he stepped down as CEO of SQPN to focus on his work with Trideo, another media venture which he launched in 2014. Vonh√∂gen received widespread media attention again in 2015 for his reaction to the teaser trailer for the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

With ever dropping prices of hardware devices, the market for networking devices and systems is undergoing a kind of change that can be loosely termed as ‚Äògeneralization‚Äô. Big established enterprises like Cisco, Novell, Sun Microsystems etc., no longer manufacture all the hardware required in the market, instead they ‚Äòlicense‚Äô or ‚Äòcertify‚Äô small hardware players operating out from countries like Taiwan or China. Certification process = Vendor certification = To obtain certification, the hardware or software has to conform to a set of protocols and quality standards that are put in place by the original creator of technology. Usually the certification process is done by a ‚ÄúCertification partner‚Äù. Certification partners are selected by the original creators of the technology and these partners are given the authority to do the testing and certification process. After a product is found to be compatible, it is labelled as xxx certified where xxx is the name of the original creator of the technology. Vendors use a ‚Äúlabel‚Äù on the products to advertise the fact of compatibility with the said technology. The process of certification ensures that the products made by different manufacturers are standardized and are compatible with each other as indicated in hardware or software platform. = Third-party certification = Third-party certification is undertaken by an independent body. To obtain third-party certification, the hardware or software has to confirm to a set of quality standards determined by the third- party. Various certifications * Cisco certification: Cisco manufactures networking hardware devices and systems. Hardware and software companies use the certification issued by Cisco‚Äôs partners to ensure that their ware is compatible with the Cisco standards and protocols. * Sun Certification:This is for Independent Software vendors (ISV) involved in developing applications that are compatible with Java technology. Java was created by Sun Microsystems and is widely used to write enterprise and consumer application solutions. * Novell Certification: Novell began certifying partner hardware with NetWare in the 1980s. The name of the certification is \\"YES Certified\\". The Yes Certified program involves certification of Partner hardware with SUSE Linux Enterprise software. Since 2005 the program has shifted from Novell NetWare to SuSE Linux and has become the SUSE YES Certified Program. The certified Hardware is given a Yes Certification Bulletin which can be viewed online.SUSE Yes Certification Bulletin Search Page More information about the Yes Certification program can be found at SUSE's website.SUSE Yes Certification program website * Microsoft's certification for Vista: This certification is called \\"WHQL\\" Windows Hardware Quality Labs\\". The dominant position of Windows in the computing world ensured that there are enormous number of applications written and hardware manufactured. This WHQL signifies that the hardware or software works with the Vista operating system. * Real Certification: This certification is given by RealNetworks for ensuring compatibility with its media player ‚ÄúRealPlayer‚Äù. Mobile computing devices like cell phones and PDAs are equipped with RealPlayer to enable them to play streaming content. * Linux certification programs: Hardware vendors use this certification for their products to ensure compatibility with Linux based systems.Linux on Laptops * SpectraLink certification: SpectraLink VIEW Certification Program is designed to ensure interoperability for enterprise Wi-Fi based infrastructure products that support NetLink Wireless Telephones. * Altiris Developer Program Certification: Altiris is a leading vendor of IT service-oriented management solutions. * EMC Centera Proven: This certification is a good way to demonstrate that your solution takes full advantage of EMC Centera Platform which can be crucial to sales. * Skype Certification: Skype-certified products satisfy both the Technical Requirements and the Design Guidelines of Skype. * Linux-Tested Certification: Hardware Vendors can use the Linux-Tested program from AppLabs to certify their products are compatible with the Linux OS and have been tested for complete functionality.

It is in the genus Asclepias, making it a type of milkweed. It is native to the Eastern, Southern and Midwestern United States similar to the range of the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). The plant gets its name from the flowers that first develop a pink color but then turn darker purple as they mature. Unlike common milkweed, purple milkweed prefers some shade and is considered a plant of partial shade. It is also considered an indicator of oak savanna, especially in Wisconsin.http://pleasantvalleyconservancy.org/pdf/Purple%20milkweed%20paper.pdf The species rarely produces seed pods which are smooth instead of the rough warty ones produced by common milkweed.

Uses Like other members of the milkweeds, several insects live off the plant, including the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), the milkweed beetle (Tetraopes tetraophtalmus), large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), small milkweed bug (Lygaeus kalmii) and milkweed leaf beetle (Labidomera clivicollis). Other insects and pollinators feed off the flower's nectar. This species is sometimes cultivated in gardens designed to attract butterflies, but is less common than the light purple swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) or the orange butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa). The nectar of the plant attracts many other species of butterflies and insects as well.

Klebelsberg was born in Magyarp√©cska, Austria-Hungary (today Pecica, Arad County, Romania). After World War I, the Treaty of Trianon and the ravages of the civil war, Klebelsberg assumed the position of Minister of the Interior in 1921, a post which he filled until the following year. Afterwards, he served as Minister of Culture (1922‚Äì1931) and introduced many educational reforms throughout Hungary. Klebelsberg helped create elementary schools in the countryside, began the modernisation of numerous universities, and created the foreign Hungarian cultural institute Collegium Hungaricum to create awareness of Hungarian culture in other countries. Klebelsberg is also famous for introducing a progressive policy on scholarships for university students. Klebelsberg, however, was controversial with his ideology of Hungarian supremacy, which attributed superior value to Hungarian ethnic culture over the minority ethnic cultures of the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (Serb, Slovak, Romanian, Jewish etc.). After the Trianon Treaty, Klebelsberg's ideology and educational reforms directly served the territorial revisionist and chauvinistic claims of the Hungarian regimes during the governor Mikl√≥s Horthy's reign. Klebelsberg was antisemitic blaming the entire Hungarian Jewry for the bourgeois liberal and communist revolutions and governments of 1918 and 1919, respectively, for the loss of territories associated with Trianon Treaty.

Biography Sadreddin Nizamettinovich Maksudov was born on 23 July 1878 in Ta≈üsu, in the Kazan Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Tatarstan), the son of a mullah, and the younger brother of Hadi Maksudi, the well-known Jadidist. After the traditional mektep and medreseh education, he took the (then) unusual step of entering the Russian Teachers' College in Kazan (for which he was much criticized by his community at the time), then studied law in Paris. Four years later, in 1906, he returned to Russia and began political activities that displayed a liberal nationalist tendency. Maksudi became the leader of the Muslim faction in the Russian parliament. Sadri Maksudi Arsal was married to Kamile, the daughter of the gold-mining Rameev family of Orenburg, had two children - Adile and Naile. He died in Istanbul in 1957. He was interred at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery in Istanbul. Political Career in Imperial Russia Sadri Maksudi Arsal, 1910 On his return to Russia in 1906, thanks to the rights conferred in 1905 to all the subjects of the Czar, he entered politics in order to voice issues concerning the Tatar people and the Muslim community. He found himself elected at a very young age as a deputy of the (liberal) Kadet Party to the II. and III. Dumas. At the Duma, he favored a centrally administered cultural autonomy for all Russia's Muslims until it was apparent that the Volga Tatars, who mainly promoted this solution, had been abandoned by the other Turkic Muslims of the Russian Empire. Political Leader/Statesman ‚Äì Maksudi was the leader of the first state formation (in the 20th century) in his native Idel-Ural State since the fall of the Kazan Khanate to the Moscovite princedom in 1552. Like all the other peoples within czarist Russia, the Turkic peoples of Russia undertook political ventures with the advent of the 1917 Revolution. After the various ‚ÄúMoslem congresses‚Äù taking place in 1917, during which different and conflicting opinions were expressed concerning the political future of the Turkic peoples of Russia, the ‚ÄúNational-Cultural Autonomy of the Turco-Tatars of Inner Russia and Siberia‚Äù was proclaimed in Ufa (in present-day Bashkortostan) on 22 July 1917, with a constitution drafted by Maksudi. General elections were held soon thereafter and a National Assembly (Milli Meclis) was convened in November. Maksudi was elected its president. The formation of a ‚ÄúNational Council‚Äù composed of three ministries, also headed by Maksudi, followed. The autonomous government was gathering momentum with a project to turn itself into the independent \\"Idel-Ural State\\". But this was not to be. The Bolsheviks would not allow it. The National Assembly would stop convening and the National Council would be abolished by April 1918. After the defeat of the Tatar nationalists at the hands of Stalin and Tatar Communists, Maksudi emigrated to Finland. In 1919, he delivered a diplomatic note concerned with the demands of the Muslims of European Russia to the Versailles Peace Conference, along with Gayaz Iskhaki. In the early 1920s Maksudi was in Berlin where he began a scholarly career which he vigorously continued after he arrived in Ankara in 1925. Academia Scholar/Academic - Settled for a time in Paris, Maksudi started teaching the history of the Turks at the University of Sorbonne. But a lecture tour he made in 1924 in the new Turkish Republic was to bring about a radical change in his life. In 1925 he received a letter from Hamdullah Suphi, then president of T√ºrk Ocaklarƒ± (Turkish Hearths/Cultural Centers) informing him that ‚ÄúGazi hazretleri (His Excellency the Ghazi Atat√ºrk)‚Äù was inviting him to Turkey. In Turkey, Ord. Prof. Sadri Maksudi Arsal (as he would become eventually) emerged as a multi-faceted thinker, a scholar whose work in the fields of law, history, philosophy, linguistics and sociology made a rarely found contribution to the world of ideas and scholarship during the founding years of the Turkish Republic. A major figure in national history (he would be nominated a candidate at the presidential elections in 1950), Arsal tried to propagate his ideas through his books, scholarly writings, newspaper articles, lectures at the university, and speeches at the parliament. Man of law ‚Äì A graduate of the Paris Faculty of Law, Arsal was one of the founding faculty members of the Ankara School of Law (as it was then called) opened in 1925. He taught for many years in that faculty then later at Istanbul University. His Hukukun Umumi Esaslarƒ± (General Principles of Law, 1937), Hukuk Tarihi Dersleri (Lectures in the History of Law, 1938), Umumi Hukuk Tarihi (History of General Law, 1941), Hukuk Felsefesi Tarihi (History of the Philosophy of Law, 1946), and T√ºrk Tarihi ve Hukuk (Turkish History and Law, 1947) have been valuable contributions to the development of the teaching of law in Turkey. However, his major contribution to legal studies has been his establishing the discipline of History of Turkish Law, a course which is today a standard element in legal studies curricula in Turkey. He laid the foundations of this course, and taught it for the first time in the world. Political Career in the Republic of Turkey He had a second career in Turkey, where he was invited to help build the newly founded Republic (and where he adopted the additional surname, \\"Arsal\\"), as a close associate of Kemal Atat√ºrk, contributing to the language reform as well as to the turn Turkish historiography would take, while at the same time serving as a member of parliament, and pursuing an academic career as a member of the faculties of law of Ankara and Istanbul universities from which he would retire as an \\"ordinarius professor.\\" Member of Parliament - A frequent guest at Atat√ºrk's dinner table during meals that functioned as workshops or \\"fora\\"; or, put in another way, one of the persons whose advice Atat√ºrk sought, Arsal was twice a member of parliament during the one-party period: a representative of ≈ûebinkarahisar between 1931 and 1935, and of Giresun between 1935 and 1939. He devoted himself totally to academic life after that, with the one exception between 1950 and 1954 when he was elected as a Demokrat Parti deputy representing Ankara. Influence (Scholar and Political) His influence on the establishment of the Language and Historical Societies ‚Äì Arsal played a decisive role in the establishment of both the Society for the Study of the Turkish Language (later the Turkish Language Institution), and the Society for the Study of Turkish History (later Turkish Historical Institution). He authored much of T√ºrk Tarihinin Anahatlarƒ± (Outlines of Turkish History, 1930), that reflected the official history of the period. Arsal has also made a major contribution to the language reform. He collected his essays on the subject in a volume titled T√ºrk Dili ƒ∞√ßin (For the Turkish Language, 1930), a work that was a turning point for the language reform and which Atat√ºrk endorsed by writing a preface. Some of Atat√ºrk's compendious statements in that preface are oft repeated in our day and have been engraved on the inscription that is in front of the T√ºrk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Institute) building in Ankara. Nationalist - Arsal's last endeavor was to publish in 1955 Milliyet Duygusunun Sosyolojik Esaslarƒ± (Sociological Bases of the Nationalist Feeling) which he called his \\"spiritual testament.\\" Putting on paper a lifetime's study and reflection, Arsal discussed in this work the concept of nationality and developed a modern theory of nationalism. In the book, he argues that contemporary nationalism should distance itself from chauvinism and, just like the religious sphere did, adopt a rational stance.

Depending on the temperature of the emitting body, the wavelength of the peak of the infrared radiation ranges from to 1 mm. No contact or medium between the two bodies is needed for the energy transfer. Infrared heaters can be operated in vacuum or atmosphere. One classification of infrared heaters is by the wavelength bands of infrared emission. * Short wave or near infrared for the range from to , these emitters are also named bright because still some visible light is emitted; * Medium infrared for the range between and ; * Far infrared or dark emitters for everything above . History German-British astronomer Sir William Herschel is credited with the discovery of infrared in 1800. He made an instrument called a spectrometer to measure the magnitude of radiant power at different wavelengths. This instrument was made from three pieces. The first was a prism to catch the sunlight and direct and disperse the colors down onto a table, the second was a small panel of cardboard with a slit wide enough for only a single color to pass through it and finally, three mercury-in-glass thermometers. Through his experiment Herschel found that red light had the highest degree of temperature change in the light spectrum, however, infrared heating was not commonly used until World War II. During World War II infrared heating became more widely used and recognized. The main applications were in the metal finishing fields, particularly in the curing and drying of paints and lacquers on military equipment. Banks of lamp bulbs were used very successfully; though by today's standards the power intensities were very low, the technique offered much faster drying times than the fuel convection ovens of the time. After World War II the adoption of infrared heating techniques continued but on a much slower basis. In the mid 1950s the motor vehicle industry began to show interest in the capabilities of infrared for paint curing and a number of production line infrared tunnels came into use. White, Jack R. Herschel and the Puzzle of Infrared. Tech. 3rd ed. Vol. 100. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Research Port. Web. 16 Apr. 2013.Arnquist, W. \\"Survey of Early Infrared Developments.\\" Proceedings of the IRE 47.9 (1959): 1420-430. Print.Technology Guidebook for Electric Infrared Process Heating, Cincinnati: Infrared Equipment Association,1993. Battelle Columbus Division, Electric Elements The most common filament material used for electrical infrared heaters is tungsten wire, which is coiled to provide more surface area. Low temperature alternatives for tungsten are carbon, or alloys of iron, chromium, and aluminum (trademark and brand name Kanthal). While carbon filaments are more fickle to produce, they heat up much more quickly than a comparable medium-wave heater based on a FeCrAl filament. When light is undesirable or not necessary in a heater, ceramic infrared radiant heaters are the preferred choice. Containing 8 meters of coiled alloy resistance wire, they emit a uniform heat across the entire surface of the heater and the ceramic is 90% absorbent of the radiation. As absorption and emission are based on the same physical causes in each body, ceramic is ideally suited as a material for infrared heaters. Industrial infrared heaters sometimes use a gold coating on the quartz tube that reflects the infrared radiation and directs it towards the product to be heated. Consequently, the infrared radiation impinging on the product is virtually doubled. Gold is used because of its oxidation resistance and very high infrared reflectivity of approximately 95%.Next Generation Transparent Furnace, Dr. Stephen C. Bates Types Infrared heaters are commonly used in infrared modules (or emitter banks) combining several heaters to achieve larger heated areas. Infrared heaters are usually classified by the wavelength they emit: Near infrared (NIR) or short-wave infrared heaters operate at high filament temperatures above and when arranged in a field reach high power densities of some hundreds of kW/m. Their peak wavelength is well below the absorption spectrum for water, making them unsuitable for many drying applications. They are well suited for heating of silica where a deep penetration is needed. Medium-wave and carbon (CIR) infrared heaters operate at filament temperatures of around . They reach maximum power densities of up to (medium-wave) and (CIR). Far infrared emitters (FIR)WHAT IS FAR INFRARED HEATING (FIR) are typically used in the so- called low-temperature far infrared saunas. These constitute only the higher and more expensive range of the market of infrared sauna. Instead of using carbon, quartz or high watt ceramic emitters, which emit near and medium infrared radiation, heat and light, far infrared emitters use low watt ceramic plates that remain cold, while still emitting far infrared radiation. The relationship between temperature and peak wavelength is expressed by Wien's displacement law. =Metal wire element= Metal wire heating elements first appeared in the 1920s. These elements consist of wire made from chromel. Chromel is made from nickel and chrome and it is also known as nichrome. This wire was then coiled into a spiral and wrapped around a ceramic body. When heated to high temperatures it forms a protective layer of chromium-oxide which protects the wire from burning and corrosion, this also causes the element to glow.Primer of Lamps and Lightning; Willard Allphin, P.E.; Addison- Wesley Publishing Company, third edition 1973; Soviet infrared heater with open wire element. 1963 =Heat lamps= A heat lamp is an incandescent light bulb that is used for the principal purpose of creating heat. The spectrum of black-body radiation emitted by the lamp is shifted to produce more infrared light. Many heat lamps include a red filter to minimize the amount of visible light emitted. Heat lamps often include an internal reflector. Heat lamps are commonly used in shower and bathrooms to warm bathers and in food-preparation areas of restaurants to keep food warm before serving. They are also commonly used for animal husbandry. Lights used for poultry are often called brooding lamps. Aside from young birds, other types of animals which can benefit from heat lamps include reptiles, amphibians, insects, arachnids, and the young of some mammals. The sockets used for heat lamps are usually ceramic because plastic sockets can melt or burn when exposed to the large amount of waste heat produced by the lamps, especially when operated in the \\"base up\\" position. The shroud or hood of the lamp is generally metal. There may be a wire guard over the front of the shroud, to prevent touching the hot surface of the bulb. Ordinary household white incandescent bulbs can also be used as heat lamps, but red and blue bulbs are sold for use in brood lamps and reptile lamps. 250-watt heat lamps are commonly packaged in the \\"R40\\" (5\\" reflector lamp) form factor with an intermediate screw base. Heat lamps can be used as a medical treatment to provide dry heat when other treatments are ineffective or impractical. =Ceramic infrared heat systems= Ceramic infrared heating elements are used in a diverse range of industrial processes where long wave infrared radiation is required. Their useful wavelength range is 2‚Äì10 Œºm. They are often used in the area of animal/pet healthcare too. The ceramic infrared heaters (emitters) are manufactured with three basic emitter faces: trough (concave), flat, and bulb or Edison screw element for normal installation via an E27 ceramic lamp holder. =Far-infrared= This heating technology is used in some expensive infrared saunas. It is also found in space heaters. These heaters use low watt density ceramic emitters (usually fairly big panels) which emit long wave infrared radiation. Because the heating elements are at a relatively low temperature, far-infrared heaters do not give emissions and smell from dust, dirt, formaldehyde, toxic fumes from paint-coating, etc. This has made this type of space heating very popular among people with severe allergies and multiple chemical sensitivity in Europe. Because far infrared technology does not heat the air of the room directly, it is important to maximize the exposure of available surfaces which then re-emit the warmth to provide an even all round ambient warmth. =Quartz heat lamps= Clear quartz element Halogen lamps are incandescent lamps filled with highly pressurized inert gas combined with a small amount of halogen gas (bromine or iodine); this lengthens the life of the filament (see ). This leads to a much longer life of halogen lamps than other incandescent lamps. Due to the high pressure and temperature halogen lamps produce, they are relatively small and made out of quartz glass because it has a higher melting point than standard glass. Common uses for halogen lamps are table top heaters.Heat-dissipating Light Fixture for Use with Tungsten-halogen Lamps. Allen R. Groh, assignee. Patent 4780799. 25 Oct. 1988. Print.Schmidt, F. \\"Modelling of Infrared Heating of Thermoplastic Sheet Used in Thermoforming Process.\\" Journal of Materials Processing Technology 143-144 (2003): 225-31. Print. Quartz infrared heating elements emit medium wave infrared energy and are particularly effective in systems where rapid heater response is required. Tubular infrared lamps in quartz bulbs produce infrared radiation in wavelengths of 1.5‚Äì8 Œºm. The enclosed filament operates at around , producing more shorter-wavelength radiation than open wire-coil sources. Developed in the 1950s at General Electric, these lamps produce about () and can be combined to radiate 500 watts per square foot (). To achieve even higher power densities, halogen lamps were used. Quartz infrared lamps are used in highly polished reflectors to direct radiation in a uniform and concentrated pattern. Quartz heat lamps are used in food processing, chemical processing, paint drying, and thawing of frozen materials. They can also be used for comfort heating in cold areas, in incubators, and in other applications for heating, drying, and baking. During development of space re-entry vehicles, banks of quartz infrared lamps were used to test heat shield materials at power densities as high as 28 kilowatts/square foot (300 kW/m2).Raymond Kane, Heinz Sell Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress (2nd ed.), The Fairmont Press, Inc. 2001 chapter 3 Most common designs consist of either a satin milky-white quartz glass tube or clear quartz with an electrically resistant element, usually a tungsten wire, or a thin coil of iron-chromium-aluminum alloy. The atmospheric air is removed and filled with inert gases such as nitrogen and argon then sealed. In quartz halogen lamps, a small amount of halogen gas is added to prolong the heater's operational life. The majority of the radiant energy released at operational temperatures is transmitted through the thin quartz tube but some of that energy is absorbed by the silica quartz glass tube causing the temperature of the tube wall to increase, this causes the silicon-oxygen bond to radiate far infrared rays. Quartz glass heating elements were originally designed for lighting applications, but when a lamp is at full power less than 5% of the emitted energy is in the visible spectrum.Investigation of Reflective Materials for the Solar Cooker =Quartz tungsten= Quartz heater Quartz tungsten infrared heaters emit medium wave energy reaching operating temperatures of up to (medium wave) and (short wave). They reach operating temperature within seconds. Peak wavelength emissions of approximately 1.6 Œºm (medium wave infrared) and 1 Œºm (short wave infrared). =Carbon heater= Carbon Fiber Heater Carbon heaters use a carbon fiber heating element capable of producing long, medium and short wave far infrared heat. They need to be accurately specified for the spaces to be heated. =Gas-fired= There are two basic types of infrared radiant heaters. * Luminous or high intensity * Radiant tube heaters Radiant tube gas-fired heaters used for industrial and commercial building space heating burn natural gas or propane to heat a steel emitter tube. Gas passing through a control valve flows through a cup burner or a venturi. The combustion product gases heat the emitter tube. As the tube heats, radiant energy from the tube strikes floors and other objects in the area, warming them. This form of heating maintains warmth even when a large volume of cold air is suddenly introduced, such as in maintenance garages. They cannot however, combat a cold draught. The efficiency of an infrared heater is a rating of the total energy consumed by the heater compared to the amount of infrared energy generated. While there will always be some amount of convective heat generated through the process, any introduction of air motion across the heater will reduce its infrared conversion efficiency. With new untarnished reflectors, radiant tubes have a downward radiant efficiency of about 60%. (The other 40% comprises unrecoverable upwards radiant and convective losses, and flue losses.) Health effects In addition to the dangers of touching the hot bulb or element, high-intensity short-wave infrared radiation may cause indirect thermal burns when the skin is exposed for too long or the heater is positioned too close to the subject. Individuals exposed to large amounts of infrared radiation (like glass blowers and arc welders) over an extended period of time may develop depigmentation of the iris and opacity of the aqueous humor, so exposure should be moderated.https://web.archive.org/web/20060220181822/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/0753.html Efficiency Electrically-heated infrared heaters radiate up to 86% of their input as radiant energy.2008 ASHRAE Handbook ‚Äì Heating, Ventilating, and Air- Conditioning Systems and Equipment (I-P Edition), American Society of. Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., 2008, Electronic , table 2 page 15.3 Nearly all the electrical energy input is converted into infrared radiant heat in the filament and directed onto the target by reflectors. Some heat energy is removed from the heating element by conduction or convection, which may be no loss at all for some designs where all of the electrical energy is desired in the heated space, or may be considered a loss, in situations where only the radiative heat transfer is desired or productive. For practical applications, the efficiency of the infrared heater depends on matching the emitted wavelength and the absorption spectrum of the material to be heated. For example, the absorption spectrum for water has its peak at around . This means that emission from medium-wave or carbon infrared heaters is much better absorbed by water and water-based coatings than NIR or short- wave infrared radiation. The same is true for many plastics like PVC or polyethylene. Their peak absorption is around . On the other hand, some metals absorb only in the short-wave range and show a strong reflectivity in the medium and far infrared. This makes a careful selection of the right infrared heater type important for energy efficiency in the heating process. Ceramic elements operate in the temperature of producing infrared wavelengths in the 2 to range. Most plastics and many other materials absorb infrared best in this range, which makes the ceramic heater most suited for this task. Applications Infrared heater for cooking IR heaters can satisfy a variety of heating requirements, including: * Extremely high temperatures, limited largely by the maximum temperature of the emitter * Fast response time, on the order of 1‚Äì2 seconds * Temperature gradients, especially on material webs with high heat input * Focused heated area relative to conductive and convective heating methods * Non-contact, thereby not disturbing the product as conductive or convective heating methods do Thus, IR heaters are applied for many purposes including: * Heating systems * Curing of coatings * Plastic shrinking * Plastic heating prior to forming * Plastic welding * Glass & metal heat treating * Cooking * Warming suckling animals or captive animals in zoos or veterinary clinics References Further reading * Deshmukh, Yeshvant V.: Industrial Heating, Principles, Techniques, Materials, Applications, and Design.
