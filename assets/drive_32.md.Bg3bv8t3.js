As a film editor, she has worked exclusively with director Scott Hicks in a notable collaboration from 1988 through 2007; their work together includes the 1996 film Shine. She has directed and written several films, including Me Myself I (2000), which was released internationally. Early career Karmel is the daughter of Peter Karmel, who was an Australian economist, professor, and university administrator. She studied visual arts in Adelaide. She was an assistant editor in the mid-1980s. She worked for editor Andrew Prowse on several films including Call Me Mr. Brown (1985), which was Scott Hicks' first feature film. She subsequently studied film directing and editing at the Australian Film Television and Radio School. She interrupted her studies to edit Hicks' feature Sebastian and the Sparrow (1988), which was her first feature credit as an editor. Her graduate film was Sex Rules (1989), a short film. Television and Shine In the early 1990s Karmel worked primarily as a director and writer. She directed an episode, The Long Ride, for the Australian television program Under the Skin; the episode won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Tele-feature. Hicks persuaded Karmel to return to editing for the film, Shine, which Hicks was directing and had co-written. Shine (1996) has become Hicks' most recognized film; it is based on the early life of David Helfgott, who became a concert pianist following several years of institutionalization for mental illness. In his Variety review, David Stratton wrote, \\"Securing the musician's cooperation was obviously crucial to Jane Scott's accomplished production, which is also distinguished by Geoffrey Simpson's fine camerawork and Pip Karmel's editing, the latter skillfully shaping a wealth of material into a fast-paced, compelling narrative.\\" Karmel has now edited several additional films with Hicks. Me Myself I Karmel worked throughout the 1990s on the film Me Myself I (2000), which she wrote and directed. Karmel's script explores the choices made by an unmarried woman who has become a successful journalist; in the film, the woman enters an \\"alternate reality\\" in which she is married to a former beau and has three children. The film was mainly seen in Australia, but was internationally distributed and widely reviewed. Roger Ebert and other critics have emphasized Rachel Griffiths' performance in the lead, but Andrew Sarris noted in The New York Observer, \\"In any event, Ms. Karmel, whether as erstwhile writer, editor, or maker of short films, has earned the right to a long and fruitful directorial career on the strength of Me Myself I, one of the most striking feature-film debuts ever.\\" Screenplays in development Karmel has written a screenplay for a film adaptation of Geraldine Brooks' 2001 novel, Year of Wonders, which is a story of a 17th-century plague year in an English village. Interview with James Bogle, Pip Karmel, and Luke Davies about adapting novels for screenplays. As of 2012, this film, which Karmel is slated to direct, is \\"in development\\". Karmel and Vincent Sheehan wrote a screenplay for a comedy What Alice Forgot, and in 2012 received a grant to support further development of a film. Awards Karmel's editing of Shine (1996) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, the BAFTA Award for Best Editing, and an American Cinema Editors Eddie Award, and it won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Achievement in Editing.

He was a member of the commission responsible for forming the Corpus Juris Civilis. . On February 13, 528, Basilides was appointed as a member of the commission preparing the Corpus Juris Civilis, serving under Tribonian. Their work was completed in 529. While this is the first chronological mention of him, the text of his appointment mentions him as being already a vir excellentissimus (\\"most excellent man\\"), a former praetorian prefect of the East and a patrician. His title of praetorian prefect has been suggested to be honorific, as modern historians find it strange that Basilides could have served in this high-ranking position prior to holding lower offices.. On April 7, 529, official texts mention Basilides as the serving praetorian prefect of Illyricum, a rank lower than his previous title of praetorian prefect of the East. A passage of the Greek Anthology mentions a \\"Basilius\\" (, Basil) who had served as praetorian prefect of Illyricum and whose statue reportedly stood over the east gate of Thessalonica. Cyril Mango has suggested that this \\"Basilius\\" was actually Basilides.. In January 532, the Chronicon Paschale identifies Basilides as the deputy magister officiorum, replacing Hermogenes who had taken up military duties in the Iberian War against the Sassanid Empire. Basilides was eventually replaced by Strategius.. During the Nika riots (January 532), Basilides, Constantiolus, and Mundus served as envoys of Emperor Justinian I to the rioting crowds. They partly attempted to calm the rioters and partly attempted to understand the causes of their wrath. Their report to the Byzantine emperor placed the blame for the uprising on the unpopular financial ministers John the Cappadocian, Tribonian, and Eudaemon, leading to their dismissal from office. Basilides replaced Tribonian as quaestor sacri palatii, the senior legal authority in the Byzantine Empire. He was apparently considered more \\"acceptable to the people\\". Soon after, however, he joined Mundus in his attack on the Hippodrome of Constantinople that crushed the revolt.. . Basilides likely held his position as quaestor for a couple years at most, for Tribonian was reinstated in late 534 or early 535. A later narrative on the building of the Hagia Sophia claims that Basilides helped raise money and material for the building project. However, the narrative involves several miracles and is considered unreliable. Basildes's actual role in the project, if any, remains uncertain.. Basilides is next recorded holding the title of magister officiorum. His term lasted from March 18, 536 to November 22, 539. He was also an honorary consul in this period. John of Ephesus reports that Pope Agapetus I, visiting Constantinople, sent a magister and the Excubitors against Zooras, an adherent of Monophysitism. Since the events are dated to March 536, the unnamed magister was probably Basilides.. In 539, Emperor Justinian replaced Basilides with Peter the Patrician.. Nothing is known of Basilides following the 530s. The late 10th- century Patria of Constantinople reports that the location of his palace in Constantinople was still known by Basilides's name, centuries following his death..

Since first taking up painting around 1990, her works of contemporary Indigenous Australian art have been acquired by several major collections including Artbank and the National Gallery of Victoria. Her paintings portray bush plum \\"dreaming\\" and women‚Äôs ceremonies (known as Awelye). One of her paintings sold at a charity auction for A$22,800. Josepha Petrick's works are strongly coloured and formalist in composition and regularly appear at commercial art auctions in Australia. Her art appears to have survived the huge contraction of the primary art market in Australia since 2008. There is no existing Catalogue raisonn√© of Josepha Petrick's artworks, to date, no fakes have been cited.  Personal background  Josepha Petrick Kemarre is an Anmatyerre- speaking Indigenous Australian, born around 1945 or 1953 at the Santa Teresa Mission, near Alice Springs in Australia's Northern Territory. When Josepha Petrick began painting for Mbantua Gallery in central Australia, she indicated that her name was Josepha rather than Josie, and that this was how she henceforth wished to be known; however Mbantua's biography is the only source that has used that version of her name. After marrying Robin Petyarre, brother of artist Gloria Petyarre, Josepha Petrick moved to the region of Utopia, north-east of Alice Springs, which is where she was living when she began painting around 1990. They had seven children, one of whom, Damien Petrick, went on to become an artist like his mother. By 2008, Josie Petrick's husband had died, and Petrick was dividing her time between Alice Springs and Harts Range, to its north-east.  Professional background  Carissa spinarum is represented in Josie Petrick's paintings of bush plum dreaming. Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after the introduction of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint. In the western desert communities such as Utopia, Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. =Career= A painting by Josie Petrick, showing the 'bush plum' pattern characteristic of her works. Josepha Petrick began painting about 1990 or 1992 as part of the contemporary Indigenous art movement that had begun at Papunya in the 1970s. By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions, such as Charles Sturt University, and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue; her painting was printed opposite that of Yannima Tommy Watson, who was by this time famous, particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Mus√©e du quai Branly. Petrick's paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong, as well as at the Australian embassy in Washington in 2001. In 2006 a commissioned work by Petrick was exhibited at Shalom College at the University of New South Wales as part of a charity fundraising exhibition. It sold for A$22,000. As of the end of 2008, the highest recorded auction price for an item of Petrick's work was $22,800, set in May 2007. An image based on a triptych by Petrick, Bush Berries, appears on the cover of a book on the visual perception of motion, Motion Vision. Central Australian artists frequently paint particular \\"dreamings\\", or stories, for which they have responsibility or rights. These stories are used to pass \\"important knowledge, cultural values and belief systems\\" from generation to generation. Paintings by Petrick portray two different groups of dreamings, rendered in two distinct styles. Bush plum dreaming represents a plant of the central Australian desert which is \\"a source of physical and spiritual sustenance, reminding [the local Indigenous people] of the sacredness of [their] country\\". These paintings are undertaken with red, blue and orange dots that represent the fruit at different stages in its development. She also paints women‚Äôs ceremonies (Awelye) and dreamings, and these are created using rows of coloured dots and include representations of women's ceremonial iconography. Journalist Zelda Cawthorne described Petrick as one of the \\"finest contemporary Aboriginal artists\\". Art consultant Adrian Newstead has ranked her as amongst the country's top 200 Indigenous artists, noting that she has become \\"known for innovative works that create a sense of visual harmony through fine variegated fields of immaculately applied dotting\\". Her style is described by Indigenous art writers Birnberg and Kreczmanski as an \\"interesting, modern interpretation of landscape\\". Petrick's work is held in a variety of public and private collections, including Artbank, the Charles Sturt University Collection, the Holmes a Court Collection, and the National Gallery of Victoria.

The song has been since covered by multiple artists including Inner City Unit, The Lemonheads, Neighb'rhood Childr'n, Tarnation, The Primitives and The Cars. It was The Nightcrawlers' only hit.  Original recording  The song was written in 1965 for an Easter concert, in which the band opened for The Beach Boys.\\"The Nightcrawlers - Sally in Our Alley (1966)\\" The song was originally recorded in 1965 by sound engineer Lee Hazen and released on Hazen's record label Lee Records; the 1965 release became a regional hit in The Nightcrawlers' home state of Florida and in the Midwest. The song was re-released on Kapp Records in 1966, finally charting nationally in both the US and Canada early the following year. Allmusic reviewer Matthew Greenwald describes the song as a \\"slightly bizarre nursery rhyme\\", with lyrics about a rotten bird's egg. Other explanations claim the song referenced miscegenation in segregated Florida.  Other versions  The Little Black Egg was included in the influential compilation album Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965‚Äì1968, on the 1998 CD reissue, as a bonus track. Ohio punk band The Pagans recorded the song in the late 1970s. In 1981, during recording sessions for Shake It Up, members of The Cars recorded a version featuring Ric Ocasek on lead vocals. The song was later stripped of Ocasek's vocals and re-sung by fashion model Bebe Buell, whom Ocasek had befriended. The version with Buell's vocals was included on her 1981 EP Covers Girl; the Cars' version was released on 1995's Just What I Needed anthology.

This particular study was the first to show that a topical gel could reduce a person's risk of contracting HIV. The gel used in the study contained a microbicide. Background A previous study had measured the safety and tolerability of tenofovir in both sexually active and abstinent women. This study gave support to the idea that tenofovir was a drug which was worth examining as an HIV preventative. Study design CAPRISA 004 was a phase IIb, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comparing 1% tenofovir gel with a placebo gel. 900 young women who were judged to be at risk of contracting HIV volunteered to use a study gel in their vaginas, with half of those receiving the microbicide gel and the other half getting the placebo (according to their randomization results). The study asked participants to apply a first dose of the gel within 12 hours before having sex and to apply another dose within 12 hours after sex. All study volunteers participated in HIV risk reduction counseling and received condoms. The study assisted in arranging treatment for any sexually transmitted infections that participants contracted. The study began in May 2007, was completed in December 2009, and the data collected was published in March 2010. The study design had expected the study to last for 30 months, with about 14 months to recruit study volunteers then with follow-up until 92 participants were observed to have become infected with HIV. The entrance criteria was such that, based on risk factors in the participants' lifestyles, the study expected 92 infections to occur approximately 16 months after they recruited the final volunteer. Results Researchers led by Quarraisha Karim found that a microbicide containing 1% tenofovir was, for women participating in the trial, 39% effective in reducing risk of contracting HIV during sex and 51% effective in preventing genital herpes infections. Responses The results of CAPRISA 004 were formally released at the 18th International AIDS Conference. Michel Sidib√© of UNAIDS described the results of the study as being very encouraging because the treatment \\"can be controlled by women, and put in 12 hours earlier, and that is empowering. They do not have to ask the man for permission to use it. And the cost of the gel is not high.\\" Anthony Fauci of NIAID stated that \\"This is the first study that has shown a clear-cut positive effect of a microbicide on blocking acquisition of HIV infection.\\" Mitchell Warren, head of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, remarked that \\"This is a really historic day for HIV prevention research. For the first time, through the CAPRISA 004 trial, we have seen evidence in a human clinical trial that a microbicide can help to prevent sexual transmission.\\" A Phase III study named \\"FACTS 001\\", a larger study involving 2,200 women in Africa which is expected to start around the end of July 2011 and last 24 months. Research partnerships CAPRISA conducted CAPRISA 004 with the following assistance: *the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided funding *the Technology Innovation Agency (TIA), a biotechnology agency of the South African government's Department of Science and Technology, provided funding *Gilead Sciences provided tenofovir for the gel used in the study *Family Health International provided technical assistance such as clinical trial protocol development, clinical monitoring, and clinical study design * CONRAD provided consulting related to microbicides The principal investigators for the study were Salim Abdool Karim and Quarraisha Abdool Karim, both of the University of KwaZulu-Natal.

Alt URL He was popularly known as the \\"$10,000 hunting dog.\\" He was described as a \\"national symbol of what was great in bird dogs.\\" Benjamin Frederick Wilson, Count Noble's owner His owner, Captain Benjamin Frederick Wilson, was a banker and coal barge operator. While he was well known for his hunting prowess and show skills, it was his prepotency, the ability to pass on his best traits to his progeny, that made him the most famous. In 1880, he won the national amateur Derby dog show. He was so famous that owners of other setters refused to compete in shows with him. Other shows offered special inducements in order to encourage his owner to compete. Writing in 1904, Joseph A. Graham gives this description of Count Noble: \\"A large white-black-tan dog, long in the body and not considered a well proportioned setter. He weighed sixty pounds.\\" A portrait of Count Noble by Edmund Osthaus hangs in the first-floor reading room of the Duquesne Club. Following his death, his preserved body was displayed in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in a scene showing him hunting quail. The display was moved to The National Bird Dog Museum in Tennessee.

He was awarded the Order of Vytautas the Great and Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas. Early life Simonaitis received his education in Heydekrug (≈†ilutƒó) and Tilsit (Sovetsk) and worked as a court clerk. He became a Lithuanian activist in 1909. In 1912 he was co-founder of the Lithuanian Club of Tilsit (), which he chaired for two years. In 1915, Simonaitis was mobilized into the German Army. He was awarded the Iron Cross for his military service in France and Galicia. After World War I, he briefly worked in Vilnius where he became acquainted with Lithuanian politicians and the Council of Lithuania. After returning to Tilsit in 1918, he participated in the activities of the National Council of Lithuania Minor (), which adopted the Act of Tilsit but Simonaitis did not sign it. In 1919 he moved to Memel (Klaipƒóda). Klaipƒóda Region Klaipƒóda Directorate in 1923. Simonaitis is sitting in the center. According to the Treaty of Versailles, the Klaipƒóda Region (Memel Territory) was detached from the German Empire and placed under provisional French administration. French General Dominique Joseph Odry established seven-member Directorate (local government) in February 1920. Initially all of its members were German. After Lithuanian protests, two Prussian Lithuanians, Simonaitis and Mikelis Reidys, were admitted to the Directorate increasing its size to nine members. Simonaitis resigned in February 1922. He lobbied the League of Nations and the Conference of Ambassadors to unite the Klaipƒóda region with Lithuania. However, others thought that the region should be turned into a free city, similar to the Free City of Danzig. Therefore, the Lithuanian government decided to organize the Klaipƒóda Revolt, take the region by force, and present a fait accompli. Simonaitis agreed to head the government, which would be installed by the rebels. On January 9, 1923, the Supreme Committee for the Salvation of Lithuania Minor declared that the old Directorate was dissolved and authorized Simonaitis to form a new Directorate within three days. The rebel's petitione to unite with Lithuania was approved by the First Seimas (parliament of Lithuania) on January 14. To appease the Allies, Simonaitis was dismissed and replaced by Viktoras Gailius. After the Klaipƒóda Convention was signed in May 1924, formalizing the incorporation of the region into Lithuania, Simonaitis became chairman of the Directorate (January‚ÄìNovember 1926), governor of ≈†ilutƒó (1924‚Äì1926) and Klaipƒóda Counties (1930‚Äì1934), and mayor of Klaipƒóda (July 1934 ‚Äì April 1935). World War II and after In March 1939, Nazi Germany presented an oral ultimatum to Lithuania demanding to cede the Klaipƒóda Region. Lithuania accepted and Simonaitis, fearing Nazi persecution, moved to Kaunas. After the occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany in June 1941, Simonaitis was arrested by Gestapo and sent to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in November 1942. In April 1945 he was liberated from the Dachau concentration camp. After the war he remained in West Germany, returning to Prussian Lithuanian activism. He chaired the re-established National Council of Lithuania Minor until his death, represented Lithuania Minor in the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania, and was vice- chairman of the German chapter of the Lithuanian World Community. Personal life and children In 1911 Simonaitis married a German woman, Margaretha Plaumann. They had four children: daughters Ana Marija and Birutƒó Neringa and sons Vitold-Vytautas and George-Jurgis. Vitoldas-Vytautas was mobilized into the Wehrmacht and died in 1941 in the Battle of Leningrad. Margaretha and Ana Marija attempted to flee Lithuania after the war, but were stopped by the Soviet police. They changed their names to Elena and Ona in an attempt to hide their German descent and returned to Klaipƒóda. Birutƒó Neringa was forcefully taken to Germany as a translator. She met her father at Dachau, but returned to Lithuania in 1948. His remains were reburied in Klaipƒóda cemetery in 1991.

The Kwango River basin has large resources of diamonds in the Chitamba-Lulo Kimberlite Cluster in Lunda Norte Province, discovered in the main river channel and on flats and terraces in its flood plains. History The Rund Kingdom, which expanded to become the Lunda Empire, encompassed territory stretching from Kwango River to the Laupala. Its rulers pursued slavery trade. Lunda expansion in the valley promoted a common political and cultural heritage while also promoting slave trading, accounting for the low population densities between the Kwango and Kwilu rivers.Ogot, p.607 The Portuguese colonized the Kwango River valley and replaced the Kingdom of Kasanje. The Kwango River was subject to a Portuguese treaty signing in Lisbon on May 25, 1891 and the Declaration of March 24, 1894. Cuango town, situated in Lunda Norte Province within the Cuango River valley, is considered to be ‚Äúin the diamond heartland of northeastern Angola‚Äù, the richest diamond area in Angola. This town played an important role during the civil war as both Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) and government forces attempted to seize and hold the city. UNITA surrendered the town to the government on 30 September 1997 as part of the Lusaka Protocol. Geography Map The Cuango originates in the highlands of Alto Chicapa in the Angolan province of Lunda Sul, and flows south-north-west, crossing the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and joining the Kasai River near the town of Bandundo. Thereafter, it empties into the Congo River. Rising in the Lunda plateau, the river forms a deep valley. It is long from its source to its confluence with Congo River, of which lies in Angola. The river drains a total catchment area of . Its right bank tributaries are the Wamba and Kwilu rivers. ;Navigation The Cuango has a number of falls and rapids. Navigability is mostly achieved in the lower reaches of the river, spanning a length of from its mouth to the Kingushi rapids. Partial navigation is also possible in the middle stretches of the river between Kingushi and the Franz Josef waterfalls over a distance of about . ;Water resources The lean season flow in the river occurs during August. The average annual discharge in the lower reaches of the river is /s Culture The river valley is inhabited by the Yaka, the Suku, the Mbala, and the Pende tribal groups. Their crafting skills are seen in the form of mask carvings in geometric patterns of figurines, and other carved objects. Economy While the river is used for fishing, the valley is developed to the extent of providing subsistence agriculture only. Of note historically is palm oil and rubber production. The main economic activity and revenue to the Angolan State is derived by extraction of diamonds from the valley. The river basin has a rich source of diamonds in the Chitamba-Lulo Kimberlite Cluster in Lunda Norte Province, which was discovered in the main river channel and on flats and terraces in its flood plains. The provinces of Lunda Norte and Lund Sul in the river valley account for largest number of diamond mines in the valley and in Angola.

Roso was born in Kuna Pelje≈°ka and lived in Zagreb, Croatia. He earned his BA in Psychology from University of Zagreb (Croatia) and later pursued postgraduate studies in psychotherapy at the School Of Medicine, University Of Zagreb. He received a master's degree in criminology from Skopje University and was professor at the Police Academy of Zagreb. Zvonimir Roso is the author of two highly regarded books: Polygraph in Crime Investigation (Poligraf u kriminalistici, Zagreb, 1987)Open Library and Informative Conversation and Interview (Informativni razgovor i intervju, Zagreb, 1988, 1995).Open Library Written from an interdisciplinary perspective, his works are considered the most comprehensive text on polygraph ever published in South-eastern Europe. They are studied not only by criminologists, but also by students of law and psychology. In the book Polygraph in Crime Investigation (Poligraf u kriminalistici) Zvonimir Roso explores the possibilities of application of the polygraph technique and gives a history of lie detection methods. He presents the physiological and psychological basis of polygraph examination, experimental studies of blood pressure, pulse, respiration and galvanic skin reflex (G.S.R.). Book explains polygraph methods, the handling of polygraph recordings and interpretation of the results. The author advocates comparative advantages of POT (Peak of Tension Test) and GKT (Guilty Knowledge Test) over CQT (Control Questions Technique). Observations on the legal status of the polygraph, the admissibility of the results of polygraph testing, the opinions of leading Croatian lawyers and crime investigators and some court decisions, which serve as legal precedents, are mentioned. The book contains studies of actual cases. At the time when Zvonimir Roso was first introduced to the polygraph, the use of the \\"lie-detector\\" as a tool in criminal investigation, was almost unheard of in Eastern Europe. As a pioneer in the field Roso was successful in solving some of the most complex criminal cases. Through his career he had amassed a remarkable body of work and scientific writings, and uniquely combined practice and scholarly work in criminology and forensic psychophysiology. The recipient of numerous honors, a distinguished member of the Croatian Association of Psychologists, an extraordinary scientist and practitioner, Zvonimir Roso saw the polygraph as an auxiliary tool in crime investigation and was against its use as a diagnostic tool to absolutely verify guilt or innocence of a person (or suspect). Roso introduced standards of practice modeled after those of the American Polygraph Association.James Allan Mate, Forensic Psychophysiology Using The Polygraph (J.A.M. Publications, 1996) 45 He advocated the need for systematic education of polygraph examiners and inspired the Croatian forensic psychophysiologists to cooperate more closely with their colleagues abroad, to exchange experience, and to become members of APA (American Polygraph Association).

Description Sussex Street is adjacent to Darling Harbour and as such has a wide range of buildings associated with the harbour activities and industries. In this respect it is similar to other streets like Kent Street and Wattle Street, whose character was largely influenced by their proximity to Darling Harbour. The street features a large number of older, heritage buildings, alongside more recent developments like the Sheraton Four Points Hotel.

Biography =Early life and education= Kai Nielsen was born on 26 November 1882 in Svendborg, the son of Christian Nielsen, a watchmaker, and his wife Ane Marie. At 15 he became an apprentice painter but was artistically inclined and began to paint landscapes and portraits. At the same time he studied at the technical school in Svendborg where he was taught moulding by Edvard Eriksen, later famous for creating The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen. In 1901 he moved to Copenhagen and took drawing classes to prepare for the Art Academy. When he applied, they rejected his drawings but accepted him into the Sculpture School in view of a portrait bust he had made in Svendborg, and he became a student of Carl Aarsleff. At the Academy he began a lifelong friendship with Einar Utzon-Frank who also studied sculpture. Together they explored the modern collections at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek where Nielsen was particularly impressed by the works of Auguste Rodin and Constantin Meunier. =Career= Kai Nielsen showing his Bindesb√∏ll bust to art historian Karl Madsen and Prof. Joakim Skovg√•rd Nielsen developed a socially conscious style (The Blind Girl, 1907, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek). He had his breakthrough with Naked (1908) which was acquired by the Danish National Gallery. The Marble Girl attracted attention for its redefinition of the relationship between subject and material with its equal emphasis of the sculpture as woman figure and as stone block. It also introduced the rounded female forms which continued to be a dominant subject throughout his production. A large portrait bust of Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll erected at Vester Boulevard (now H. C. Andersen Boulevard) in Copenhagen was his first large-scale commission in the portrait genre. It was followed by smaller portrait heads of artist colleagues such as Niels Larsen Stevns and Ludvig Karsten, the boxer Dick Nelson (1918) and more children. Kai Nielsen at Bl√•g√•rds Plads One of Nielsen's first public sculptures, the Ymir Well from 1913 for a square in Faaborg, was controversial in its own day for the nudity of the j√∂tunn Ymir. Around the same time he collaborated with the architect Ivar Bentsen on a redevelopment of Bl√•g√•rds Plads, a public square in one of the poorest working-class neighbourhoods in Copenhagen. His work, executed from 1912 to 1916, consists of 22 granite sculptures integrated in a low wall which encloses a central, rectangular section of the square. The sculptures all portray a person plying a trade--a tailor, a cooper, a baker--accompanied by an abundance of chubby toddlers. The intention was to celebrate the workers and the children of the surrounding community and their everyday lives. It provoked hefty debate and criticism when it was inaugurated but was innovative in its integration of the sculptures in a piece of street furniture and a functional context. The wall was intended for sitting and climbing on, as well as the central space for children's play, and also incorporated a \\"soapbox\\" or tribunal for public speaking. Leda without the swan, 1920 From 1918 to 1920 he created a comprehensive decorative scheme for the Norwegian shipping magnate Anton Fredrik Klaveness's park at Lysaker outside Oslo. Its centrepiece, The Water Mother (), features prominently in the winter garden of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek which also holds the original plaster model. =Early death= Bronze statuette, 14 cm Kai Nielsen died on 2 November 1924 while working on a draft for a Maritime Monument (1924, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek) after several lengthy spells of illness.

Bibliothek der Freien Universit√§t Bozen, ital. Biblioteca universitaria di Bolzano) like the regional library \\"Dr. Friedrich Te√ümann\\" takes part of the big scientific libraries of South Tyrol.  Overview  The media of the University Library are mainly available in the three languages of the Free University of Bozen- Bolzano (German, Italian and English). At the location in Brixen-Bressanone there are Ladin media, too. The Library has its main seat in the central building of the Free University in Bozen-Bolzano (Universit√§tsplatz 1 - Piazza Universit√† 1). Other locations are situated in Brixen-Bressanone and in Bruneck-Brunico. With the Library of the University of Theology and Philosophy of Brixen-Bressanone, the oldest scientific library of the province, there exists a close collaboration. Until the University building in Brixen- Bressanone was not finished, the premises of the University of Theology and Philosophy were used.  History  With the foundation of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano began the organization of the University Library. Thanks to the financial support of the Foundation of S√ºdtiroler Sparkasse ‚Äì Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano, the Library developed to an institution, which is geared towards students' needs and which is deep-seated within the trilingual region. It assumes important electronic services within the library system of South Tyrol. Since 1998 the Library's collection is accessible through an online catalogue and the setup of an eLibrary started.  Organisation  Like the University itself, the Library has three locations: Bolzano, Bressanone and Brunico but Bolzano functions as the central library. For a better service the primary subdivision in Branch libraries in 2008 has been dispersed and four overlapping departments have been founded: * Online Services & Resources (Digital Library) * Subject & Liaison Librarians (specialist counselling and support of students and scientists) * Customer Service (non-electronic library services and customer service) * Media processing (acquisition, local public infrastructure and allocation of information carriers and information). The library services of departments which are not situated on the University campus, like the Language Centre, are coordinated and supervised by the central library in Bolzano or the libraries in Bressanone or Brunico.  Main tasks  The main task of the Library of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano is it to provide the information required for teaching and learning, research and lifelong learning. Other tasks are: * the construction and development of a digital library * the mediation of information literacy through courses, instruction and training * the allocation of various spaces for sophisticated styles of science and learning * the development of innovative solutions and active participation in research projects, networking with national and international partners. = Services = During the academic year the Library in Bozen-Bolzano remains open until midnight. In the academic year 2009/2010, the opening hours during the exam period were extended for Free University of Bozen-Bolzano students and the Library was open on Sundays, too. Graduates, postgraduates and academic staff can have unlimited access. In Bruneck-Brunico students can use the Library from Monday-Sunday from 8AM-10PM. If library users need media which are not available within the region, they can make an interlibrary loan request by completing a form on the Library's homepage. The Library offers a free delivery service between the libraries of Brunico- Bruneck, Bressanone-Brixen and Bolzano-Bozen. Since February 2007 there has also been a delivery service between the University Library and the Schlandersburg Library in Schlanders (Vinschgau). Since 2010 media can also be ordered from the Library of the Ladin Cultural Institute Micur√† de R√º in San Martin de Tor in Val Badia. The University Press is the own publishing company of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano and the Library is coordinating this service since November 2007. = Spaces and facilities = At the beginning there were no buildings available to house the libraries as they first had to be planned and to be constructed. The libraries were therefore located in temporary premises. The Library in Bolzano was situated in the former hospital in the city centre of Bolzano. The Bressanone library was housed in the University of Theology and Philosophy in Bressanone. This library was enlarged and rebuilt to accommodate the University Library's collections. Although today these two scientific libraries are divided location-wise, they still work together closely. Following the construction projects for the University's new premises, the libraries in Bolzano and Bressanone became integrated into the new buildings (completion in Bolzano in 2003 and in Bressanone in 2004). In Brunico there has been built a new building together with the Civic Library (completed in 2013). There is located also the city archive and the estate of the author N.C. Kaser.  Collections and departments  Collection (as of 2014): 256.850 Books and Non-Book-Material; 61.648 E-Books; 1.159 Subscribed Print Journals; 76.816 E-Resources; 91 Databases. The Library's collection is based on the study and research areas of the University's departments (like the Language Centre) and the five faculties of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. The collection covers the following subject areas: economics, law, agricultural sciences, engineering, pedagogy, psychology, sociology, computer science, art and linguistics. In addition media from related academic fields and for language acquisition are acquired. Because of the University's trilingualism most of the media are in German, Italian or English. For the acquisition of books and other media, the Library follows clearly defined patterns and inserts Approval Plans. The library is also committed to fulfill the current needs of its users. The suggestions they make tend to be acted upon quickly and users can use the media without any bureaucratic obstacles. Since autumn 2009 the Library has been offering a great number of e-books. The University Library's collections are catalogued according to the RVK (= Regensburger Verbundklassifikation). The whole collection can be researched by using the online catalogue.  Financing  Most of the money to finance the Library comes from the provincial government of South Tyrol. A small percentage comes from the Governmental Department for Education, University and Research and from tuition fees. The S√ºdtiroler Sparkasse Foundation supports the University and therefore also the Library. The S√ºdtiroler Sparkasse Foundation also finances special projects.  Projects  Since its foundation the Library has collaborated with departments within the University and with external institutions, especially for digital innovations. One of the first projects was the translation of the RVK (= Regensburger Verbundklassifikation) into English and Italian and the guidelines were recorded in the document \\"Brixener Richtlinien\\" (29 July 1999). In collaboration with the Faculty of Computer Science of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, \\"Chatbot\\" had been developed. The \\"Cybrarian\\" supported the librarians' work and answered questions 24 hours 7 days a week. Because of huge changes within the customer service the project \\"Bob\\" had been stopped. Another research project, which was sponsored by the European Union, dealt with \\"The Development of Multilingual Retrieval systems\\", and was called CACAO (Cross-Language Access to Catalogues and On- Line Libraries). MuSIL (Multilingual Search in Libraries), which was developed by the Library in cooperation with the Faculty of Computer Science and the company CELI and which has been online since October 2007, was the basis for this EU project and has been the first result of this research collaboration. The Meta-Catalogue includes the following Southtyrolean Libraries: * Library of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano * Library of the EURAC Research * Library of the University of Theology and Philosophy of Brixen-Bressanone * Library of the Museion * Library of the Ladin Cultural Institute Micur√† de R√º * Catalogue of the project Indexing Historical Libraries * Library of the German Pedagogic Institute. In 2012 the Meta-Catalogue has been taken over from a Discovery System, which made it possible to find with one search request both electronic and printed media. The University Library changed the library system in 2013: it participated on the early adopter program of Ex Libris and as the first library of continental Europe it went online with Ex Libris' Alma.  Cooperations  The leading information facilities on the Innsbruck-Bozen-Trent axis decided to cooperate in a more intensive way by realizing different projects and services. Together with the Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry Laimburg and the S√ºdtiroler Bauernbund, the Library is working on a virtual agricultural catalogue. There is a further cooperation with the ESSPER-Service, which evaluates the Italian economic journals. Conventions for an intense collaboration in regard to inventory build-up and the reciprocal stock utilization were made with the University of Theology and Philosophy of Brixen-Bressanone and the Eurac Institute. In January 2011 the collection of the Museion has been moved to the Library of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. The same year the stocking of the conservatory C. Monteverdi Bozen-Bolzano has been integrated, too. Since December 2013 all media of the Library of EURAC Research Bozen-Bolzano, of the Library of the University of Theology and Philosophy of Brixen-Bressanone, of the Library of the Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry Laimburg and of the University Library are researchable through one common catalogue. In 2014 with the coordination and with the technical support of the University Library Bozen-Bolzano the platform Scientific Library South Tyrol went online. There had been added the stockings of the Library of the Ladin Cultural Institute \\"Micur√† de R√º\\", of the Ladin Educational and Cultural Department and of the Museum of Nature South Tyrol Bozen-Bolzano.  Rankings  Like other libraries, the Library of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano makes use of the \\"BIX\\" (=Bibliotheksindex), the benchmarking system for scientific libraries. In this way, the Library knows its position among other libraries and can therefore improve its services. \\"GIM\\" (Gruppo Interuniversitario per il Monitoraggio dei Sistemi Bibliotecari di Ateneo) is the benchmarking system in Italy since 2000. *2015: 3,5 stars in the BIX *2014: 4 stars in the BIX *2013: 3,5 stars in the BIX *2012: 4 stars in the BIX *2008, 2009, 2011: 2nd place in the BIX *2010: 3rd place in the BIX.

He received the Norwegian state three-year scholarship for artists from 1982 until 1984. Musical style In his early compositions Mostad is moving from a linear-expressionist style to a more timbre-oriented line of thinking where both modernist and romantic music are inspiring his work. From around 1975 the timbre/harmonic aspect of his music becomes more related to the harmonic series. During the 1980s and 1990s he combines this with other types of modal and free compositional techniques, sometimes utilising modal techniques as well as more overtone-oriented harmonic spectra within the same composition. At the same time he has also been experimenting with untraditional structuring of his material, both in works of one movement and in cyclical works. Many of Mostad's instrumental works as well as vocal music, are inspired by Jud√¶o- Christian texts which often influence the structuring of the music. For instance in \\"And the light shines in darkness\\" a massive dark sounding layer with much rhythmical unrest gradually gets introduced to a lighter sounding chord with notes from the harmonic series. Mostad has written chamber music, solo pieces for piano, guitar, organ and utilised electronics, both pre- recorded and live with interaction with live musicians, but his main focus has been orchestral and vocal music. His longest composition is the work \\"Were you there, when they crucified my Lord?\\" for choir, recitation, solo voices and orchestra. Performances The music of Jon Mostad has been played by leading orchestras in Norway (Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim...) as well as performed at Bergen International Festival, the Elverum Festival, Music Factory in Bergen and Dartington International Summer School in Totnes, England among other festivals. In 2010 he was featured composer of the Vinteriss festival in √òstfold (a region in Norway). He has been represented at Nordic Music Days and has been played on radio in the Nordic countries, former Jugoslavia and England. His \\"2 psalms\\" for choir has been sung numerous times in Japan, England and Norway. Mostad's music has also been performed by local amateur ensembles. Music ranging from small chamber pieces to the multimedia show Terje Vigen based on texts by Henrik Ibsen and theatrical music for Ibsen's Peer Gynt were written for local ensembles in Fredrikstad. Mostad has also got commissions from Ny Musikk, NRK radio and TV, Ungdomssymfonikerne, Det Norske Bl√•seensemble, Amsterdams Gitaartrio and Oslo Sinfonietta as well as from local ensembles in Fredrikstad. Mostad plays the piano, but has seldom been involved in performing his own music. Occasionally he has improvised pre- and postludes when substituting as organist in local churches and from time to time he has also played some of his smaller works for piano (with or without electronics) live at concerts. During the 2010 Vinterriss festival he was playing the live electronics part at the premiere of his piece \\"Ikke helt solo\\" (\\"not quite solo\\") for cello and quadrophonic live electronics. Recordings The music of Jon Mostad has been recorded by The norwegian Soloist's choir, The Oslo Philharmonic, √òystein Birkeland and Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. His orchestral works \\"House\\", \\"The light shines in darkness\\" and \\"Concerto for cello and orchestra\\" were chosen by a jury of the Norwegian Society of Composers to be recorded on the Aurora label, resulting in the CD \\"The light shines in darkness\\" with Oslo Philharmonic, cellist √òystein Birkeland and conductor Michel Swierczewski. Education Theological candidate 1965. Music and pedagogy 1969. Diploma in composition at the Norwegian Academy of Music (ending in 1974). Main teacher: Finn Mortensen. An important inspiration during his studies were the private seminars in sonology and on Mahler by Olav Anton Thommessen. Shorter courses in studio work at NSEM, H√∏vikodden (1975/76), EMS Stockholm (1983). Other activities In addition to composing, Jon Mostad was teaching arrangement and composition, music and religion at high schools in Fredrikstad and Moss (years 10-12 or 11-13 in the Norwegian school system) until he retired in 2006. Among his many students were film director Harald Zwart and composer Frank Tveor Nordensten. He has also been active in organisations such as Ny Musikk √òstfold, the regional branch of an organisation promoting contemporary music, Norwegian Society of Composers and TONO. Mostad is a devout Lutheran and has done volunteer work in Christian organisations such as being a Sunday school teacher, visiting prisoners, helping find funding and equipment for a hospital in Nigeria and delivering humanitarian aid to a village in Russia shortly after the fall of the Soviet bloc.

Born on 12 June 1956, in Duncan Village, East London (Eastern Cape Province), Ngcaba currently lives in Johannesburg and Mountain View, California. He is chairman, founder and majority shareholder of the investment group Convergence Partners and is also the former Executive Chairman of Dimension Data Middle East and Africa, a subsidiary of the Dimension Data plc Group, which was recently acquired by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT)1.\\"Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation.\\", Nippon, Japan, 24 January 2011. Retrieved 2011-01-24. Through Convergence Partners, Ngcaba is also involved in significant new communications infrastructure projects across Africa including Seacom (the first undersea fibre optic cable system serving Africa's East Coast) which was ready for service on 23 July 2009, the first private sector satellite in Africa (Intelsat New Dawn) which was launched on 22 April 2011, a joint venture to bring high capacity, long-haul terrestrial fibre to South Africa (FibreCo) and recently a new joint venture with Google to invest in CSquared, a broadband infrastructure company headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya. Ngcaba was previously an activist aligned with the African National Congress during the struggle against apartheid, and thereafter the Director General of Communications in the first democratically elected government of South Africa in 1994. He left Government in 2003 to pursue a career in the private sector. Early life and education Ngcaba's interest in technology dates back to his childhood when he would accompany his father to work. His father spent 38 years working for the Post Office, 20 years of which he was a Postmaster. There Ngcaba met technicians and engineers and was exposed to what at the time was advanced communications technology at the Post Office, which at the time also ran South Africa's telecom networks (prior to being spun off into Telkom in the early 1990s). When he completed high school, Ngcaba enrolled at a technical college in Umtata before being hired as a bench technician by Philips in Johannesburg. There he worked with medical and telecom equipment and other scientific instrumentation. Apartheid years During the political turmoil in the late 1970s in South Africa, Ngcaba involved himself with the African National Congress underground, and actively took part in and helped plan insurgency operations. Ngcaba transited through Mozambique before joining ANC camps in Angola, where he underwent formal military training. He was trained in military communications technology before going to the then Soviet Union, where he received further specialised training. There he studied in fields of military radio, radar, reconnaissance and surveillance technologies. Ngcaba spent most of the 1980s moving between Europe, the Soviet Union and parts of Africa, with the bulk of his time being spent in Angola. In 1990, after more than a decade of struggle, Ngcaba was among the first exiles to return to South Africa. He helped the ANC establish its Johannesburg headquarters and was soon appointed as the organisation's head of IT. Ngcaba was responsible for the establishment of the Centre for Development of Information and Telecommunications Policy which was instrumental in: * Training and skills development of historically disadvantaged South Africans in the ICT sector, providing training both at local and international institutions and producing a large number of the current senior ICT executives in South Africa * Hosting and facilitating international and African telecommunications seminars and conferences that shaped the telecommunications landscape on the African Continent * The establishment of the National Telecommunications Forum in South Africa, a body that brought together all ICT stakeholders outside of Government in the period leading up to the 1994 elections  Government  On his return to South Africa after exile, Ngcaba continued his contribution to the ICT sector by participating in various initiatives that positively shaped the ICT sector both in South Africa and in the region. These included working with and serving on structures of the ITU, the global policy development and standards-making body. Soon after South Africa transitioned to a democracy, Ngcaba took up the position of Director General of the Department of Communications for eight and half years until December 2003, during which time he worked under ministers Pallo Jordan, Jay Naidoo and the late Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri. While he was Director General of the Department of Communications he participated in international organisations such as the Office of Outer Space Affairs in Vienna and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). At the Department of Communications, Ngcaba was responsible for policy formulation that restructured the ICT sector and presided over various groundbreaking initiatives designed to reorganise and overhaul the telecommunications sector, broadcasting industry, postal services and e-commerce in accordance with the imperatives of the new South African society. During this time more than 10 pieces of legislation were produced, including the Convergence Bill, which was subsequently promulgated as the Electronics Communications Act of 2006. While he was Director General, Ngcaba founded of the Institute for Software and Satellite Applications (ISSA) and the National Electronic Media Institute of South Africa (NEMISA). He participated in the Digital Opportunity Task Force (DOTFORCE), a G8 ICT global initiative. There he helped to shape various policy initiatives that have served as a platform for the development of ICT in Africa, with specific emphasis on regulatory and policy initiatives for the establishment of independent regulatory institutions, promotion of good governance, liberalisation of the market, privatisation, introduction of competition and building of infrastructure.  Private Sector  Ngcaba resigned from his role as Director General\\"resigned from his role as Director General\\" , South African Government, Tswane, 24 January 2011. Retrieved 2011-01-24. in 2003 to pursue a career in the private sector. In September 2004, Ngcaba led a Broad-Based BEE Consortium that acquired a 25% stake in Dimension Data Middle East and Africa, later becoming Executive chairman. After Thintana (the former Strategic Equity Partner to Telkom, comprising SBC Communications and Telekom Malaysia) divested half of its 15% stake in Telkom and announced its intention to sell its remaining interest, Ngcaba assisted in putting together the Elephant Consortium to acquire the shares. In May 2005, the Elephant Consortium, comprising private investors, industry players, sponsors, seed capital providers and more than 30% broad-based beneficiaries (groups representing interests of women, disabled and youth), acquired 6.7% of Telkom in a commercially funded structure, which ran to term in May 2010. Ngcaba invested in a further 2 companies before the formation of Convergence Partners in early 2006 as his exclusive investment vehicle. Convergence Partners has to date invested in 16 companies in the technology, media and telecommunications sector across the African continent and is an active, value-adding shareholder with a long-term investment horizon. Through Convergence Partners, Ngcaba continues to pursue his vision of a connected Africa. In this regard, Ngcaba played pivotal roles in several landmark transactions to bring critical connectivity to the continent, notably Seacom, the first East African undersea cable, and the New Dawn Satellite joint venture, which was launched in April 2011. Ngcaba currently serves on a number of boards of investee companies and is a Trustee of the Convergence Partners Foundation Trust, a not-for-profit vehicle to improve the education of previously disadvantaged persons using technology and to develop ICT skills that are in short supply in the continent.  Other Positions  Ngcaba has served on the Council of the University of South Africa (UNISA) and was an advisor to the Digital Inclusion Programme at Harvard University Law School. He also was a member of the Telecom Board of the ITU, served on the Board of InfoDev, a partnership of international developmental agencies, which was in turn co-ordinated and served by an expert Secretariat housed at the World Bank. Ngcaba was the Honorary Advisor representing Africa for The Prince of Wales International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF), advising on strategy and engagement throughout Africa.

An eclectic character  On the back cover of his extensive Electric Dandy Lou Reed biography, his publisher introduced him in the following words: 'A musician and producer, illustrator and speaker, and a legendary music journalist for Best Magazine, Bruno Blum lived in London during the reggae-punk years.' Originally renowned as the enfant terrible of French rock critics based in London in 1977-1982, Bruno Blum started out in teenage punk group Private Vices in London in 1977-79. He gradually embodied an adventurer-musician globe-trotter figure, a free- spirited, astute lyric writer and a remarkable guitar player,Hear Bruno Blum playing Sweet Little Fifteen and watch him play Vent du Sud : as well as a historian of English-speaking popular music, photographer and skilled graphic artist. A fully bilingual (English-French) vegan and ecologist, he has lived without drugs or alcohol for over twenty years. In the \\"Human Race\\" CD booklet, a Blum production, noted American reggae historian Roger Steffens described him as \\"a virtuosic polymath\\" and concluded: \\"An artist, producer, director, archivist, musician as well as author of and contributor to dozens of books [including 'Jama√Øque, sur la piste du reggae,' where Blum tells his own account of his musical adventures in Jamaica], Doc Reggae stands supreme among France's reggae chroniclers in his perceptive observations and the impressive variety of his accomplishments, not the least of which can be found on the album you now hold.\\" = Musician = As a teenage bass player he was part of the late seventies London punk movement and was later the first French musician to record and release dub music, as well as afrobeat. He has released several French songs albums (including the classic Nuage d'√âthiopie) in a wide variety of styles. Blum is known, among other things, for his work with the press-acclaimed Asmara All Stars and on Serge Gainsbourg's three reggae albums, which he has produced new mixes of, as well as dub and deejay versions in 2003. He produced a definitive mix of Serge Gainsbourg's Gainsbourg Et C√¶tera Palace live album in 2006. In 2015 two 'Super DeLuxe' triple CD sets were released in the form of books: Gainsbourg and the Revolutionaries (Gainsbourg's three reggae albums in the Blum mixes form, including 8 previously unreleased tracks) and Gainsbourg in Dub, which contains 50 previously unreleased dubs. He also released his own dub work, much of it done in Jamaica, on his Sophisticated Love album by Dub De Luxe. First and foremost a singer-songwriter in the French tradition, Blum also performs steadily with his rock/soul/blues and reggae bands as a singer and lead guitar player. His abounding, dense world often includes a touch of humour, and his art complements his Jamaica, Nigeria and USA-inspired music. Influenced by the electric, genuine analog sound and militant spirit of the 1970s, his wide array of works melt into a coherent whole, where different styles are approached in true eclectic fashion. Alternatively playing blues,Watch Bruno Blum playing Jimi Hendrix' Hear my train a Comin dub (which he often mixes himself on analog sound boards), rock, jazz, afrobeat, reggae, etc., he is playing \\"Organic culture music guaranteed to be played without machines by live, free-range musicians\\".Excerpt from the Nuage d'√âthiopie CD cover His successful French (\\"Guerre\\") and English versions of Bob Marley's \\"War\\" recorded with The Wailers gave him some international exposure and recognition. He also created Human Race Records, a vinyl record label in Jamaica. According to Roger Steffens in the Human Race anthology booklet notes, he is an \\"independent polymath thriving on passion\\" and always funded his own recordings, which put forward his individual, idiosyncratic lyric style. He occasionally records 'updated' pastiches of well-known songs in both English and French, including I Feel-Like-I'm-A-Fixin'-To-Die Rag,Watch the video of Bruno Blum's 'updated' version of \\"I Feel-Like-I'm-A-Fixin'-To-Die Rag\\": the Viens fumer un p'tit joint √† la maison hit and satirical songs such as \\"√áa Bouge (sur la place Rouge)\\". His own French songs output often displays puzzling double-entendre lyrics. In 2015, he formed Cabaret V√©gane, the first all-vegan group, releasing an album of mostly original songs the following year and playing several shows in Paris, singing with female singer Joy Gross, who stars in 'Cl√©mentine est v√©gane,' a hit music video on Facebook 'Cl√©mentine est v√©gane' music video: https://www.facebook.com/1718349655106350/videos/1993368514271128/ (also in English as 'Clementine Is a Vegan' 'Clementine Is a Vegan' music video: https://www.facebook.com/1718349655106350/videos/2096521340622511/UzpfSTE3MTgzNDk2NTUxMDYzNTA6MjExNjA0NDE0NTMzNjg5Nw/). Following the demise of the record industry, Bruno Blum was also one of the first French musicians to release most of his output on bandcamp.com. = Writer, musicologist = Besides his extensive work as a lyric writer, Blum has completed a master's degree in music, musicology, creation and society and speaks worldwide on the history of reggae music, African musics and other rock and blues culture-related subjects as well as veganism. His reggae lectures come with his reggae photography exhibition. Written in a lively style, several of his books on music history give him an authority status in the French-speaking world. These include Lou Reed, Bob Marley and John Lennon biographies, best-seller Le Reggae, a fully illustrated Jamaican travel journal autobiography and a major contribution to best-selling Le Dictionnaire du Rock. A musicology and music graduate, his documented music reissues (he runs three series of documented CD box sets for Fr√©meaux & Associ√©s for which he wrote substantial, informative ethnomusicologic booklets) including major Bob Marley & the Wailers reissues with U.S. partner Roger Steffens gave him some international recognition. He is often working as an interpreter, has published many translations and texts in English, including English versions of his many Fr√©meaux & Associ√©s booklets, translated six books and has also directed several documentaries for television. In addition, Blum has moved on and published two substantial surveys on societal issues: his book Shit - Tout Sur Le Cannabis includes an autobiographical chapter and the 2016 De Viandard √† V√©gane is written in the form of an autobiography depicting his growing awareness of veganism through his musical career. = Illustrator, cartoonist, artist, photographer, filmmaker = Blum has published many cartoons, illustrations and comic strips in several of his books, in U.K. comic books and newspapers as well as a long list of French magazines including Best, Actuel, L'Environnement Magazine, Panda Magazine and Hara-Kiri. Perhaps his most significant work as a graphic artist is his 150-page \\"Rock And Roll Comics\\" album, a collection of his early comic strips, featuring a popular Mot√∂rhead story, done at a time when he played in a London punk rock group and was the London correspondent of French rock magazine Best. This \\"autobio- graphic novel\\" includes time period fiction stories, previously unpublished art and also features a substantial chapter of his rock photography. A prolific artist, besides photography, illustration and comic strips, he has also always produced graphic work meant to be exhibited.See Blum's 2010 exhibition at Les Trois Baudets in Paris: He often draws a blurry line between plastic arts and comic strip, as in the \\"Don't Drink and Drive, Smoke and Fly\\" series (see picture above) where the story jumps out of the pages to become a series of pictures, before going back to its initial, former frame. As a reporter photographer he has accumulated archives published in several of his books alongside his illustrations. His photo exhibition \\"Jamaica on the Reggae Tracks\\" has been shown all over France since 2008. His 2007 book of the same name, Jama√Øque sur la piste du reggae features a mix of his photographs, narrative and art. Blum is one of the few photographers who managed to take pictures of nearly all of the British new wave groups, including Buzzcocks, Sex Pistols, Clash, and many US artists such as Iggy Pop, Heartbreakers, Johnny Thunders, Devo, David Johansen and Patti Smith as well as several lesser-known groups, as shown in his Fils de Punk photo exhibition premiered at Stereolux in Nantes (France) in March‚ÄìApril 2017. Published in 2017, his Carnets exceptionnels de mes voyages travel books unveil a full-fledged talent as an illustrator. He has also directed Tenor Saw's classic Ring the Alarm reggae video as well as other videos, and worked as a journalist/director for Tracks, an Arte TV channel show about music culture. His artwork can be seen in the video of his song \\"Papa Legba,\\" which was directed by Pascal Le Gras (best known for his cover artwork for British post-punk group The Fall. The hit video Cl√©mentine est v√©gane (English version: Clementine Is a Vegan) features some of his art, as well as Le Gras', Mandryka and street artist Invader.  Biography  = Early life = A Spirou magazine reader and Andr√© Franquin (Spirou, Marsupilami, Gaston Lagaffe) fan, the song Les √âlucubrations d'Antoine was a revelation for him at an early age. When advertising was permitted on French television from October 1, 1968, his parents of humble origins Nicole and Tony Blum started producing advertising films. Their success was immediate. Their company, named FBI (Falby Blum International) had already produced several films by young director Jean-Jacques Annaud when they were awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Advertising Film Festival in 1972 for Annaud's Crackers Belin film. The company had opened offices in five countries as Tony Blum moved to Toronto in Canada, where his son joined him during the 1974 and 1975 summers. Aged fifteen, he was already bilingual after several stays in the UK, USA and Canada. His father produced the first feature film by J√©r√¥me Savary Le boucher, la star et l'orpheline (1975). Bruno Blum got to meet and know his parents' colleagues and friends, including directors Jean-Jacques Annaud, Ridley Scott and actors such as Pierre Desproges and Jerry Lewis, but he was not interested in advertising. A dedicated comic strip reader, as early as twelve he was the founder of several amateur college comic magazines with his classmates. After an encounter with Asterix author Ren√© Goscinny, he created a magazine named Klaus in the Paris art school Les Arts Appliqu√©s where he studied comic book art with Georges Pichard, Jacques Lob and Yves Got. In 1974‚Äì1975, the very young editor gathered a team of talented artists that would all become professionals, including Bernar, Fernand Zacot, Klaus, Jean Teul√© and classmate Jean-Marie Blanche, son of the famous French comedian and humorist Francis Blanche, an inspiration to both friends. Failing all studies, Blum was evicted out of three colleges, including two art schools. Self-taught from then on, he would build teams following the same pattern, being the prime mover in many of his future projects. = Move to London = Following two convictions for record theft, and as his parents' company was going bankrupt, causing them to lose almost everything, in 1976-1977 the drifting teenager moved to London to study animation film with Oscar Grillo (who directed an animation film for Linda and Paul McCartney) and keenly attended rock clubs. In 1977-1978 he lived in North London's Stamford Hill Jamaican neighbourhood where he discovered reggae sound systems and dub music. He also made the earliest known recording of a then unknown band, The Police, with a hand stereo recorder at London's Roxy Club on March 3, 1977. Going through straits, he stayed in London squats, sharing houses with punk rock musicians including Private Vices and The Electric Chairs. A precocious, gifted person, he had already formed a rock group when he started writing for glossy magazine Best, a popular rock monthly for which he was London correspondent from 1977 to 1981 as chronicler, reporter, illustrator and photographer. He would then work for years with a small team comprising Christian Lebrun, Francis Dordor and Patrick Eudeline, travelling (and recording) to the UK, USA and Jamaica as a reporter. His successful In The City column, in which he published accounts of the very influential British music scene of the time, was written in lively, vivid gonzo style and left its mark on the French youth. He met several reggae artists, including Linton Kwesi Johnson, Steel Pulse, Peter Tosh, Toots and the Maytals, Bob Marley and widely contributed to promoting reggae music among the French youth with his stories in popular Best Magazine. He also interviewed rock artists, including Nico, Lou Reed, John Cale, Wilko Johnson, Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, The Clash, the Sex Pistols, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Lenny Kravitz, The Stranglers, Fela Kuti and many more. By 1978, he had become a daily contributor as London correspondent and chronicler to nationwide French radio station Europe 1's Monde de la Musique show hosted by Pierre Lescure. He was recording and touring the UK in 1978-1979 with British punk group Private Vices, which he founded in 1977 with Christophe Ruhn. He was to be the first French journalist to write about The Pretenders, Devo, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Madness, Mot√∂rhead and the then-unknown Stray Cats, which he put up in his London squat as they first arrived from New York City. He also drew their original logo (as seen on the original Runaway Boys single cover), and drummer Slim Jim Phantom's tattoo showing a drum set bearing his name.See the Stray Cats interviewed by Antoine de Caunes, Jacky and Bruno Blum at The Palace in Paris, 1981 His Rock and Roll Comics book is a testimony of his rock artwork and photographs from this London phase. In 1979-1981 he had a love affair with the late Saskia Cohen-Tanugi, who appeared in the James Bond film Never Say Never with Sean Connery and later became a noted theater director and writer. = 1980s = Blum was a militant ecologist since the age of fourteen, and after discussing the matter with The Pretenders' singer Chrissie Hynde, he went vegetarian like her, a theme he would later sing about in his songs \\"Clementine Is a Vegan\\" and \\"Les Andouilles\\" and write much about in his animalist, 2016 autobiography De Viandard √† v√©gane.See Bruno Blum telling his life story and seeing vegetarian rock stars https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS57UyE-hBo Blum then became a DJ at the London Marquee Club as an occasional replacement for his girlfriend, DJ Mandy Hermitage. Initially published in Best, his fiction comic strip Rock Commando staging Mot√∂rhead was published in New Music News in London, then issued by the band as a comic book in the UK. He then created the Nutty BoysSee the French \\"Madness\\" Encyclopedia where Blum's contribution is detailed (at the letter B): b.htm comic book for pop group Madness, drawing their biopic in issue #1. Blum came back to live in Paris after a busking episode in Nice in the summer of 1982 with Nice-born photographer Youri Lenquette on second guitar. In 1983 he formed Les Amours, a six-piece vocal group which recorded and toured in 1984. In 1984-85 Blum begun a side career as fashion model, posing for several advertising pictures, including for France Inter radio. Still writing for Best in the 1980s, for a time he contributed to the Les Enfants du Rock rock TV show with Antoine de Caunes as a reporter and published cartoons in the magazines Rigolo, Best and Zoulou, an Actuel magazine offshoot. In 1985, as seen in several TV shows,See a video of Catherine Ferry in Michel Drucker's featuring Bruno Blum on bass including Michel Drucker's, he was featured live in Catherine Ferry's rock backing band produced by French pop star Daniel Balavoine. Blum then recorded a few demos of his compositions in 1986 with a five-piece version of Les Amours not including the vocal group. After treating some personal problems reported in his Cultures Cannabis book, he has since abstained from using any legal (alcohol, tobacco) or illegal drug. In 1989 he recorded with some of Ziggy Marley's musicians in Kingston, Jamaica where he pressed his \\"Des Couleurs\\" vinyl single. In late 1989, he recorded and released √áa Bouge (Sur la Place Rouge) in Paris, coinciding with the fall of the Berlin Wall. His first album Bruno Blum (1989) assembled these various recordings. He became the first French musician to have played, produced and released a dub record. A video of his rock song L'Histoire de ma Guitare taken from the album was broadcast several times on M6 television in France. = 1990s = In 1990 Bruno Blum played onstage with Willy DeVille and joined Bo DiddleyBo Diddley Feat. Bruno Blum in concert, Casino de Paris, juillet 1990 live at Le Casino de Paris. A noted singer and guitar player, in 1990-1994 he led a rock cover band featuring John Weeks and other American musicians named The Sexy Frogs, with whom he recorded the original \\"J'aime les blondes\\" as well as various original songs. In 1994 he was the editor of a Best special reggae issue for which he interviewed Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, among others. In 1995 with the help of Patrick Zerbib and L√©on Mercadet he then edited a special Bob Marley issue for one-shot new magazine Radio Nova Collector that was soon to become Nova Magazine. Blum persuaded Chris Blackwell to let him include a CD featuring Bob Marley's \\"Punky Reggae Party\\" and a rare dub of \\"Is This Love\\" entitled \\"Is This Dub\\" in the issue. He drew several album covers and published artwork in Backstage, Actuel (Kronik le Kritik), Best (Scud le Rok Kritik Sourd), Hara Kiri Hebdo (weekly comic strips on vegetarian culture), L'Environnement Magazine, Panda Magazine, hosted a short, daily radio show on Radio Nova and directed the documentary film Get Up, Stand Up ‚Äì L'Histoire du Reggae produced by Jean-Fran√ßois Bizot for the Canal + channel. Jamaican producer Clement Dodd produced two of his original songs at Studio One in Kingston, Jamaica. As Dodd aka Coxsone saw Blum's Best of Reggae special issue, he nicknamed him \\"Doc Reggae\\", which has stuck since. In partnership with American specialist Roger Steffens he conceived and produced a series of ten Bob Marley & the Wailers albumsThe Complete Bob Marley & the Wailers 1967 to 1972 www.iration.com that include around a hundred rare or previously unreleased recordings (he also mixed eight of them), time period photographs and much previously unheard of 1967-1972 information. In 1997-2003 Blum revived the original Danny Sims-owned JAD American label in Paris at this occasion, and successfully released the albums in several countries. Doc Reggae then created the Jamaican label Human Race Records and its European incarnation Rastafari Records, through which he released several reggae vinyl singles featuring the voices of Haile Selassie I, Marcus Garvey, Big Youth, King Stitt, Buffalo Bill and Doc Reggae himself, also playing the guitar on all tracks. A version of Bob Marley's \\"War\\" was recorded using the voice of the lyrics' creator himself, Haile Selassie I and surviving members of the Wailers. A vinyl single featuring Bob Marley and Haile Selassie I reached the #1 spot in the April 1998 of British magazine Echoes charts. The War Album was then recorded featuring Big Youth and Buffalo Bill. In Jamaica he directed videos for Tenor Saw's Ring the Alarm and Buffalo Bill's Perfect Woman, as well as several TV reports for the Tracks show broadcast on the Arte channel. After the demise of Best in 1995 he joined competitor Rock & Folk magazine until 1999, then gave up all journalism work, excepting for a few stories published in Les Inrockuptibles, which he left in 2002. = 2000s = Pierre Astier published his first book, the comprehensive biography Lou Reed ‚Äì Electric Dandy at Le Serpent √† Plumes. A rock and reggae specialist, Blum was to publish a further fifteen books, including some successful ones, among which: * Le Reggae * Bob Marley, le Reggae et les Rastas as well as his travel chronicles, fully illustrated with his photographs and artwork Jama√Øque, sur la Piste du Reggae where he tells the story of his Jamaican adventures. He also co-signed three editions of Le Dictionnaire du Rock as a main contributor with Michka Assayas. * De Viandard √† V√©gane, his autobiography. Still performing live through the decade, after the 2001 The War Album recorded with The Wailers, where he can be heard playing the guitar and voicing two tracks, he is noted as a producer and lyric writer on his second solo album Nuage d'√âthiopie, also in 2001. Released on his own De Luxe label, this reggae album includes the single \\"Si Je Reste\\" (adapted in French from The Clash's \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\"), a duet with Annabelle Mouloudji. Nuage d'√âthiopie gets good reviews. To Yves Bigot \\" French reggae has found its songwriter \\". Backed by The Wailers on \\"Avis aux Amateurs\\", he put to music the letter in which Arthur Rimbaud breaks the news on his mother that he will remain in Africa. Going against the grain of fashionable electronic music, he forwards in a 1970s-influenced style where lyrics and skilled electric instruments players are pivotal. He refers to Boris Vian, Alain Bashung, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Jacques Dutronc (he has recorded a parody of Dutronc's \\"Et moi, et moi, et moi\\") and Serge Gainsbourg of whom he recorded a version of \\"L'Appareil √† Sous\\" (originally recorded by Brigitte Bardot) - and soon an English version of \\"Lola Rastaquou√®re\\". Bruno Blum's second album Nuage d'√âthiopie, 2001 Think Different, his third album of original compositions, was recorded in a wide array of styles and released in 2002 (featuring duets with Annabelle Mouloudji and John Hostetter), followed by Welikom 2 Lay-Gh-Us ! recorded in Lagos (Nigeria) with a 20-piece band from Fela Kuti's group, and released by BMG, which also reissued his Bob Marley 1967-1972 twelve-album series. JAD Records suddenly signed a distribution deal with Universal, and BMG was compelled to retrieve the entire JAD stock from the shops. The JAD delivery included two previously unreleased Peter Tosh albums, a Buffalo Bill album as well as Amala & Blum's Welikom 2 Lay-Gh-Us ! album which, although just released, was also retrieved from the shops by mistake (as it had nothing to do with JAD Records) in spite of getting daily airplay on Jos√© Artur's Pop Club show on France Inter. Nevertheless, Blum remains the first French musician to release an afrobeat album ‚Äì deleted shortly after its release, it only reached about a hundred journalists. In 2003 Universal Music releases two double Serge Gainsbourg CD albums, Aux Armes Et C√¶tera and Mauvaises Nouvelles des √âtoiles in a new 1970s style Kingston mix produced by Bruno Blum, featuring veteran Jamaican sound engineer Soljie Hamilton. Also included on the album are dubSee Soljie Hamilton and Bruno Blum mixing Aux armes et c√¶tera at Anchor Studio, Kingston Jamaica, in December, 2001: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0COUDu5uSHI and deejay versions (including Lisa Dainjah, King Stitt, Lone Ranger and Big YouthSee Big Youth actually recording his version of Aux Armes Et C√¶tera). The two press- acclaimed albums unveil several previously unreleased recordings, among which the Gainsbourg composition \\"Ecce Homo Et C√¶tera\\". Blum also voices one track himself, an English rendition of \\"Lola Rastaquou√®re\\", and plays guitar on his new arrangement of \\"Marilou Reggae\\", recorded with Leroy \\"Horsemouth\\" Wallace on drums and Flabba Holt on bass. After contributing to slam shows in his M√©nilmontant neighborhood, he records slammer Nada's Live at the Olympic Caf√© (2001) album. He also supplies artwork for the CD cover as well as the follow- up Ultrash, which he produces and plays on as Nada recites his lyrics over newly recorded instrumental versions of Velvet Underground songs. Two other ex-members of Best magazine's team participate to the album : Gilles Riberolles and Patrick Eudeline, who contributes with several short songs on Ultrash. Gainsbourg... Et C√¶tera, a new Blum-produced mix (Thierry Bertomeu, engineer) of the poorly mixed, original Serge Gainsbourg live album Enregistrement Public au Th√©√¢tre Le Palace is released in 2006. This double CD includes five previously unreleased versions and an interview with Serge Gainsbourg. A new album entitled Doc Reggae (partially recorded in Jamaica on the Marilou Reggae sessions with Horsemouth Wallace and Flabba Holt) is coming together with his group Dub De Luxe. Blum keeps performing live with Dub De Luxe as well as, from 2006 in an American group playing classic 1930s/1960s R&B; covers sometimes featuring pianist Gilbert Shelton, the well-known Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comic book artist. Blum also produces an album by Shelton. In 2006 he was invited to play a series of shows in Asmara, Eritrea by the French Ambassador in Eritrea. It is his first of a series of trips that would lead to producing an anthology album of the best Eritrean singers (released in 2010). In June 2007, the publication of his book Culture Cannabis led Bruno Blum to an hour-long clash with Professor Jean Costentin live on national radio France Inter. In 2008 he obtains a Master in musicology in Paris and publishes Le Rap Est N√© en Jama√Øque (Rap Was Born in Jamaica) in 2009. He also produced the Harry Belafonte - Calypso, Mento & Folk 1954-1957See online liner notes in English as well as French: Harry Belafonte, Calypso, Mento & Folk 1954-1957, Fr√©meaux et Associ√©s, 2009 anthology. Still performing onstage, he MCs dances as deejay and selecter, and speaks regularly in conferences around his country and abroad. In 2009 as he was one of the main writers in Best Magazine he creates the Facebook group Best, le mensuel du rock. This internet site would eventually lead to Blum directing an anthology book of Best's best stories. = 2010s = In the summer of 2010 a major Emma Lavigne exhibition on punk rock visual aesthetics and photographs at the Rencontres d'Arles showed his collection of rare original punk records. At this occasion he spoke on punk musical aesthetics from 1930s jazz to 1940s-1970s rock music. In September, Doc Reggae performed at the Trois Baudets in Paris. For the first time, he offered a multimedia event where his paintings, artwork, comics trips as well as his Jama√Øque sur la Piste du Reggae photo exhibition and video footage were shown before his own reggae show. In 2008-2009 he produced the Asmara All Stars Eritrea's Got Soul (released in 2010) album in Eritrea, also playing on several songs. The album gathers some of the best musicians and singers from eight ethnic groups, including Dehab Faytinga, Sara Teklesenbet, Mahmoud Ahmed Amr, Temasgen Yared, Ibrahim Goret and Adam Faid Amr. The album gets a warm welcome in the press as well as the radio: \\"If you like the Ethiopian soul-funk sound of the early 1970s, you should find much to enjoy in this contemporary take on it. Eritrea is Ethiopia's neighbour and many of the country's musicians actually contributed to those classic recordings. The main difference with this contemporary project is the influence of Jamaican reggae. But the dub elements fold perfectly into the sinuous Ethiopian grooves ‚Äì as our own Dub Colossus have already demonstrated. Vibrant, heady and sensuous stuff\\" (The Independent, London, October 2010). Two album release party shows, including one in the Opera House, take place in Asmara in October 2010. In November 2010 Volume 1 of Best of Best, an anthology of rock magazine Best to which he was a major contributor, was published. The 320 pages book was conceived, coordinated and edited by Blum with the support of the original team including Sacha Reins, Patrick Eudeline and Francis Dordor, who wrote a tribute to the late editor Christian Lebrun. As part of the Festival des Cultures Juives de Paris in June 2011 he spokeSee Bruno Blum's complete \\"Bob Marley, culture Rastafari et Juda√Øsme\\" conference at Festival des Cultures Juives de Paris 2011 online on the Akadem website: on the theme \\"Bob Marley, culture Rastafari et Juda√Øsme\\" in the Paris 4 Town Hall. In 2011 Bruno Blum also translated Kim Gottlieb-Walker's Bob Marley and the Golden Age of Reggae photo book (published in France as Bob Marley, un portrait in√©dit en photos) to which director Cameron Crowe contributed. An anthology of his Jamaican record label Human Race was released in late 2011. Essentially recorded in Jamaica, the double roots reggae CD Human Race includes The WarWar (Bob Marley song) Album with a bonus track, and features the voices of Haile Selassie I, Marcus Garvey, Gandhi, Nelson Mandela as well as Big Youth, Spectacular, Buffalo Bill, King Stitt, Brady, Annabelle Mouloudji, Joseph Cotton, Lady Manuella, Bruno Blum and several previously unreleased tracks. Illustrated by several photographs and original artwork by Blum, the CD booklet is written by renowned U.S. reggae historian Roger Steffens.

Five of his documented anthologies albums were co-published by national museums of France: Great Black Music Roots 1927-1962 and Jamaica - Folk Trance Possession 1939-1961, the latter being awarded the Acad√©mie Charles Cros' World Music Coup de C≈ìur in 2014. Slavery in America - Redemption Songs 1914-1972 includes a foreword by French Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira, author of a law compelling the French educational system to include the memory of slavery in school programs. Haiti - Vodou - Ritual Music From the First Black Republic - Folk, Trance, Possession 1937-1962 and Beat Generation 1936-1962 followed.

He also played several shows with his new vegan group Cabaret V√©gane formed in 2015, featuring young female singer Gojy Gojy, who stars in the Cl√©mentine est v√©gane video, to which artists Mandryka, Pascal Le Gras and Invader (artist) contributed. An English version of the song was also issued. Both were successful on Facebook. In 2017 Bruno Blum ran for MP in the French General Elections (for the Parti Animaliste) and obtained 1,36% of the votes in the Paris district of Le Marais. In January until March 2018, his 3-CD collection devoted to the history of avant-garde music in the twentieth century created an opportunity for the Fr√©meaux Gallery to put together an exhibition about avant-garde visual arts, as well as a conference by Blum on the topic. Blum translated three books that year: Roger Steffens' definitive Bob Marley biography, Norman Mailer's Hipster and street artist Invader's Invasion Los Angeles for which he also wrote a four-page introduction.

The college offers bachelor's degrees, associate degrees and certificates of completion in professional-technical fields. History In 1941, Renton Technical College came into existence as a war production school. Throughout the duration of World War II, the College provided customized pre-employment training and job upgrading-retraining. After the war, the College became a state-funded vocational school with the mission of assisting industry in converting from a war-time to a peace-time economy. For the next 20 years, the College conducted a large number of upgrading- retraining classes and a small number of high quality training programs. In 1965, the College moved to a central campus comprising three new buildings. For the next five years, the basis of the specialized College was laid with its emphasis on open-entry, open-exit, and continuous progress instruction based on achievement of measurable competencies. Since 1971, the College has grown to nearly 400,000 square feet and the student body has increased 500 percent. The original three buildings have been remodeled and expanded, 10 new structures have been built, four portables have been added, and the college has acquired numerous off-campus facilities. The growth of the central campus has enabled the College to improve and expand training in the growing industries of health, service, and information technology ‚Äì especially those fields that are affected by new technologies. The College continues to provide customized training and services to Puget Sound-area businesses. The second 50 years, beginning in 1991, were marked by the conversion of the state's vocational-technical institutes to technical colleges.

The W√ºrttemberg Western Railway and the Kraichgau line cross at the station. History  Bretten station was opened on 1 October 1853 as part of the construction of Western Railway from Stuttgart to Bruchsal. In the late 1870s, the Kraichgau Railway was opened from Karlsruhe to Heilbronn, creating a railway junction. At the same time the station was moved from near the town centre to its present location at the junction to the west of the town centre. The Western Railway through Bretten station was electrified in the 1950s. When Karlsruhe Stadtbahn services opened on the Kraichgau Railway to Bretten-G√∂lshausen on 25 September 1992, along with the electrification of the Kraichgau Railway, this first two-system light railway (tram-train) line was called line B. In May 1994, Stadtbahn line S9 opened from Bruchsal to Bretten and it was extended to M√ºhlacker in 1999. In 1994, line B was renamed line S4. In the summer of 2000 the station was modernised. Among other things, the platforms were raised, waiting rooms were enlarged and a toilet was built. Between 2002 and 2004, with the opening of Stadtbahn operations on the Murg Valley Railway, services were extended to Freudenstadt, but through services were discontinued at the end of 2004 due to the route's high susceptibility to delays. In addition Regional-Express trains operate from Heidelberg to Stuttgart, stopping in Bretten, as does the so- called \\"Kraichgau Sprinter\\", which runs twice daily between Heilbronn and Karlsruhe with few stops. In the station forecourt, there is a bus station served by bus lines 141, 143, 144, 145 and 146, connecting to Bretten and its immediate surroundings.

A loan shark named Sang-Hoon finds himself striking a friendship with a troubled schoolgirl, Yeon-Hee, as he faces his own troubled past with his abusive father. Breathless has won the Grand Prize at the 2009 Tokyo Filmex, the Silver Screen Award at the 2009 Singapore International Film Festival, the Tiger Award at the 2009 Rotterdam International Film Festival, the NETPAC Award at the 2009 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and the 30th Blue Dragon Awards for Best New Actor (Yang Ik-june) and Best New Actress (Kim Kkot-bi tied with Park Bo-young From Scandal Makers). It saw over 100,000 admissions in South Korea. Plot Sang-hoon is a foul-mouthed and violent gangster working for an illegal money-lending organization run by his long- time friend and loan shark, Man-shik. He is first seen attacking protestors who are disrupting the work of a construction company with the other members of the organization. Sang-hoon has a nephew, Hyung-in, whom he adores. His sister cares about the nephew also, even inviting him to dinner. Sang-hoon and her are on less than friendly terms and he avoids her. It is revealed that when he was a kid, his abusive father once had a quarrel with his mother and stabbed his sister by accident. His mother was then hit by a car. It is implied that his father has remarried. One day, after visiting his nephew, he accidentally spits on a high school student, Han Yeon-hee, who demands that he apologize. They get into an argument and he punches her, knocking her unconscious. When she wakes up, she realizes that Sang-hoon was waiting for her to awake and has wiped her clothes clean. Undaunted by his ferocity, she demands compensation from him. He is intrigued by her spunk and they form a tenuous friendship. While Sang-hoon believes that Yeon-hee comes from a rich family, they, in fact, have trouble regularly paying the rent. Her father is a war veteran who has delusions that Yeon-hee's mother is still alive. Both her father and brother, Han Young-jae, frequently threaten and verbally abuse her. A junior colleague of Sang-hoon recruits a friend, Young-jae, to work as a debt collector for Man-shik. On his first day, he accompanies Sang-hoon and his friend on their rounds. He is hesitant and Sang-hoon berates him. One day, as Sang-hoon visits his father ‚Äì recently released from prison for stabbing Sang-hoon's sister with a knife ‚Äì his father has already cut his own wrists. It is then that he realizes how much he still loves his father. That same day, Yeon-hee's father is even more paranoid and threatens her with a knife. Sang- hoon and Yeon-hee meet up for a drink and both weep, overcome with emotion. Sang-hoon tells Man-shik that it will be his last day as a gangster and invites him to meet Yeon-hee, his sister and Hyun-in. Man-shik also decides that he has had enough and wants to open a gogi gui restaurant. On his last day as a debt collector, he is doing the rounds with Young-jae. Young-jae beats a debtor against Sang-hoon's wishes, and the debtor responds by hitting Sang-hoon with a hammer. As Sang-hoon walks away with Young-jae, blood starts to flow out of his nose. He asks Young-jae for a handkerchief, but Young-jae attacks him with a hammer, and leaves him dying by the road. In the epilogue, it is strongly suggested that Sang-hoon died. Yeon-hee, Hyung-in, Sang-hoon's sister and father enjoy dinner together at Man-shik's newly opened restaurant. On leaving, Yeon-hee sees her brother destroying a street-side food stall like her late mother's.

The name comes from Saint Martin, as the orphanage was originally based in the eponymous oratory. The orphan boys themselves were thus referred to as Martinitt, a plural of Martinett (\\"little Martin\\") in Lombard language.Francesco Cherubini, Vocabolario milanese-italiano. Volume terzo M-Q, Milano, Imperial Regia Stamperia, 1841, p. 58, s.v. Martinett. The Martinitt played an important role in the history of Milan, most notably in the Five Days of Milan. History The Martinitt orphanage was founded by Gerolamo Emiliani, who had previously created an orphanage for the poor in Venice. In 1528, Duke Francesco II Sforza of Milan decided to transfer to Emiliani the oratory of Saint Martin, located in the very centre of Milan (now Via Manzoni), to be used as Milan's orphanage. Federico Borromeo later decided to give out another building, the \\"Spedale dei Mendicanti\\" (\\"beggars' hospital\\"), which was used for orphan girls. The orphan boys were called Martinitt, while the orphan girls were called Stelline. In 1776, Empress Maria Theresa moved the orphanage to Gessate, east of Milan. At the same time, it was decided that the orphans would be housed in the orphanage until the age of 18, and that they would be taught a job. In 1796, when Napoleone Bonaparte conquered Milan, he transformed the orphanage in a military hospital. The Martinitt then moved again, first in some buildings in Brera, then in an abandoned convent, and finally (1803) back to their original seat in Via Manzoni. In 1848, during the Five Days of Milan (when the Milanese population rebelled against the Austrian rule), the Martinitt contributed to the success of the Milanese serving as couriers, bringing dispatches from barricade to barricade. In 1932, a new seat for the Martinitt was established by Benito Mussolini in Via Pitteri, near Lambrate. Today, the Martinitt (and the Stelline orphanage for girls) have merged into a wider social care institution called Pio Albergo Trivulzio.Il Trivulzio official site (in Italian) A museum dedicated to the history of the Martinitt and the Stelline has been established in 2009 in Corso Magenta 57, in the building next to the \\"Stelline Palace\\" (the original seat of the Stelline orphanage).Museo Martinitt e Stelline (in Italian) Notable Martinitt orphans * Angelo Rizzoli, founder of RCS MediaGroup, one of Italy's prominent publishing houses * Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of Luxottica, the world's largest eyewear company * Edoardo Bianchi, founder of Bianchi Bicycles, a pioneering bicycle-making factory Footnotes Related topics * Stelline External links * Association of Ex Martinitt (in Italian) Category:History of Milan Category:Organisations based in Milan Category:Orphanages in Italy Category:Hospitals in Milan ","title":"Martinitt"},{"id":"30607609","text":"Edward Dayes (1763 in London ‚Äì 1804 in London) was an English watercolour painter and engraver in mezzotint. Edward Dayes, self-portrait from 1801. Life Salisbury Cathedral, 1798 engraving by Francis Jukes, after Dayes. He studied under William Pether, and began to exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1786, when he showed a portrait and views of Waltham Cross and Canterbury. In the three following years he exhibited both miniatures and landscapes. He continued to exhibit at the Academy regularly until the year of his death, contributing a total of 64 works. He also was an exhibitor at the Society of Artists. Dayes drew from nature in various parts of England, including the Lake District and Wales. Much of his topographical work depicted ruins, painted in a palette dominated by blues and greens, which had an influence on the early work of J.M.W. Turner. He laid out detailed rules for the correct method of laying down the colours in landscape in his Instructions for Drawing and Colouring Landscapes, published posthumously. The art historian Graham Reynolds sees Dayes' work as \\"mark[ing] the transition from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century\\". Many of his drawings were crowded with figures; among these were two views of the interior of St. Paul's Cathedral on the occasion of the thanksgiving for the king's recovery in 1789, The Trial of Warren Hastings in Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham House, St. James's Park (1780), later hung in the South Kensington Museum. All these works were engraved. In 1798 Dayes began to show scriptural subjects, such as The Fall of the Angels (1798), John preaching in the Wilderness (1799), the Triumph of Beauty (1800), and Elisha causing Iron to swim (1801). He was draughtsman to the Duke of York and Albany. Thomas Girtin, was his pupil. Dayes engraved at least four mezzotints, one after George Morland, another after John Raphael Smith, and two humorous scenes called Rustic Courtship and Polite Courtship. He wrote an Excursion through Derbyshire and Yorkshire, Essays on Painting, Instructions for Drawing and Colouring Landscapes, and Professional Sketches of Modern Artists. He committed suicide at the end of May 1804. After his death his works were collected and edited by E. W. Bradley, and published for the benefit of his widow in 1805. His wife painted miniatures and exhibited four works at the Royal Academy between 1797 and 1800.

The case was one of the last significant cases on ultra vires under English company law before the provisions abrogating that doctrine in the Companies Act 1985 became effective. Facts Rolled Steel Products Ltd gave security to guarantee the debts of a company called SSS Ltd to British Steel Corporation. This was a purpose that did not benefit Rolled Steel Products Ltd. Moreover, Rolled Steel's director, Mr Shenkman was interested in SSS Ltd (he had personally guaranteed a debt to British Steel‚Äôs subsidiary Colvilles, which SSS Ltd owed money to). The company was empowered to grant guarantees under its articles but approval of the deal was irregular because Mr Shenkman's personal interest meant his vote should not have counted for the quorum at the meeting approving the guarantee. The shareholders knew of the irregularity, and so did British Steel. Rolled Steel Products wanted to get out of the guarantee, and was arguing it was unenforceable either because it was ultra vires, or because the guarantee had been created without proper authority. At first instance Vinelott J held British Steel‚Äôs knowledge of the irregularity rendered the guarantee ultra vires, void and incapable of validation with the members‚Äô consent.[1982] Ch 478 British Steel appealed. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that the transaction was not ultra vires and void. Simply because a transaction is entered for an improper purpose does not make it ultra vires. He emphasised the distinction between an act which is entered into for an improper purpose (which is not beyond the capacity of a company, or void) and an act which is wholly outside a company's objects (and hence ultra vires and void). However, it was unenforceable because British Steel, with knowledge of the irregularity, could not rely on a presumption of regularity in the company‚Äôs internal management. Since British Steel ‚Äòconstructively knew‚Äô about the lack of authority, they could acquire no rights under the guarantee. On ultra vires Browne-Wilkinson LJ said the following. On the question of authority Slade LJ held that the Rule in Turquand's case, which would ordinarily entitle a person dealing with a company who to assume the company's own internal rules were complied with, did not apply when it came to someone breaching a rule to further their own personal interests.[1986] Ch 246, 283-284 See also * UK company law * Capacity in English law * Agency in English law * First EU Company Law Directive 68/151/EEC * Hartog v Colin & Shields [1939] 3 All ER 566 * Howard v Patent Ivory Manufacturing Co (1888) 38 Ch D 156 * Morris v Kanssen [1946] AC 459, a presumption of irregularity cannot be relied on by company officers Notes References * L Sealy and S Worthington, Cases and Materials on Company Law (9th edn OUP 2010) 95, 119 External links * Category:United Kingdom company case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1986 in case law Category:1986 in British law Category:Steel industry of the United Kingdom ","title":"Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltd v British Steel Corp"},{"id":"30607654","text":"Solomon Dayrolles (died 1786) was an English diplomat. Life Dayrolles was the nephew and heir of James Dayrolles, king's resident for some time at Geneva, and from 1717 to 1739 at The Hague, who died on 2 January 1739, was the godson of Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, the wit and politician, through whose friendship the young official obtained speedy advancement in his profession. He began his diplomatic career under James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave, then ambassador at Vienna, and when Waldegrave became ambassador at Versailles, Chesterfield endeavoured to obtain the appointment of secretary to the embassy for his prot√©g√©; but in this he was frustrated by superior influence. Dayrolles was sworn as gentleman of the privy chamber to George II on 27 February 1740, and retained his place in the court of George III. With the old king he quickly became a personal favourite, and was rewarded by the post of Master of the Revels (12 April 1744). He was secretary to Lord Chesterfield during the peer's second embassy to The Hague (1745), and when his patron somewhat later in the year entered on his duties as lord-lieutenant of Ireland, Dayrolles accompanied him in the same capacity, and was nominated by him gentleman usher of the black rod in the Irish House of Lords (2 September 1745), a sinecure. Through the personal liking of the king, and Chesterfield's credit with Pelham, the place of king's resident at the Hague was given to Dayrolles on 12 May 1747. He was there for four years, and then was promoted to a similar post at Brussels, which he held until August 1757. On his uncle's death in 1739 he inherited a fortune, and in that year he purchased from Sir Richard Child, Earl of Tilney, the estate of Henley Park, in the parish of Ash, near Guildford, which remained his property until 1785. In March 1786 he died, and in the same year his library was sold. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1743. Legacy Matthew Maty was assisted in his Life of Chesterfield by Dayrolles. For years he and Lord Chesterfield kept up a correspondence; his letters from Chesterfield were initially edited by Lord Mahon. The originals were bought from the heirs of Dayrolles by Messrs. Bentley, and they then passed by purchase to Mahon (by then Lord Stanhope) in April 1846. Dayrolles's own official correspondence and that of his uncle, comprised in twenty-one folio volumes, once belonged to William Upcott. Family He married, on 4 July 1751, Christabella, daughter of Colonel Peterson of Ireland, who is said to have been 'a lady of accomplished manners and dignified appearance.' She died at George Street, Hanover Square, on 3 August 1791; her age at death is given as 58, so that she must have been considerably younger than her husband. William Cramp, who wanted to fix the identity of Junius on Lord Chesterfield, published in 1851 a small pamphlet of Facsimile Autograph Letters of Junius, Lord Chesterfield, and Mrs. C. Dayrolles, showing that the wife of Mr. Solomon Dayrolles was the amanuensis employed in copying the Letters of Junius for the printer.This pamphlet was reviewed by Charles Wentworth Dilke in the Athen√¶um, 22 March 1851, and the article is reproduced in Dilke's Papers of a Critic, ii. 140-54. Dayrolles had issue one son, Thomas Philip Dayrolles, a captain in the 10th dragoons, who died at Lausanne, having married Mlle. H. G. Thomaset, a Swiss lady; and three daughters. Christabella, the eldest, married in 1784 the Hon. Townsend Mullins; their son was Thomas de Moleyns, 3rd Baron Ventry. Emily married, on 24 December 1786, the Baron de Reidezel, aide-de-camp to the Duke of W√ºrtemberg; and Mary became the wife, on 6 February 1788, of Richard Croft, junior, a banker in Pall Mall. The youngest of these daughters is said to have been the prototype of the vivacious Miss Larolles in Fanny Burney's novel Cecilia.

Modern and mediaeval toponyms  While there are Celtic toponyms all over Galicia, most Celtic and pre-Latin toponyms can be found along the coastal areas, most notably in the R√≠as Altas region around A Coru√±a, and in the valley of the Ulla river. = Regions, Mountains and Islands = Some Galician regions - usually called 'comarcas' when spanning over several municipalities, or concellos (councils) otherwise - maintain names either directly inherited from pre-Roman tribal and sub-tribal names, or simply with pre-Roman origin: * Arousa (Arauza, 899 CE): Island and municipality in Arousa bay, Pontevedra. Probably Celtic,cf. Falileyev s.v. araus(i)o-. to *(p)are-auso- 'cheek'. * Berganti√±os (Bregantinos, 924): Region, to *brigantƒ´no-Matasovic (2009) s.v. 'king', or to *brigantigno-,Koch (2003) s.v. Brigantes both etymons would have yielded the same result. Cf. Middle Welsh brenhin 'king'. * Carnota (Carnota, 915 AD): Coastal council and ancient territory, it is presided by the Monte do Pindo, an anciently sacred granite mountain. It was also the name of a mountain near Doro√±a, Vilarmaior.'discurrente ad aulam Sancte Marie, inter IIos montes Leboreiro et Carnota, secus flumen Doronia', c. 1110. To *karn- 'pile, heap',Moralejo 2010, 106. with a hypocoristic suffix. * C√©ltigosMari√±o Paz, p. 32. (Celticos in 569): Region, to the local tribe of the Celtici (plural accusative Celticos), who inhabited the westernmost regions of Galicia.

To Proto-Celtic *ambe- 'river'.Delamarre (2003) s.v. * Chonia:Monteagudo (1999) p. 266 Tributary of the Tambre River. To Proto-Celtic *klowni- 'meadow'. * Deva (Deva, 961 CE):Mari√±o Paz (1999) p. 34. At least two Galician rivers are called Deva, both tributaries to the Minho: the first flows through the municipalities of Arbo and A Ca√±iza, the second through Pontedeva (literally 'Bridge-upon- Deva'). To Celtic *dƒìwƒÅ 'goddess'.Matasovic (2009) s.v. *dƒìwo-. There is also a small village called Deva in Cervantes. Cf. also rivers Deva in Asturias, river Dee, in Britain, ancient Dƒìva.Koch (2006) p. 318. * Dubra (Dubria, 1110 CE), affluent of the Tambre River. From Proto-Celtic *dubrƒÅ- 'dark', which in several Celtic languages developed semantically into the substantive 'water'. The municipality of Val do Dubra ('Dubra's Valley') receives its name from this river. Compare with the Asturian Dobra, and the rivers Douvres in France and Dover in England. * Landro:.Monteagudo (1999) p. 278 River which flows through the town of Viveiro into the Bay of Biscay. To *(p)lƒÅn- '?River of the plane',Cf. Delamarre (2003) s.v. lano-. or to *land- 'open land (valley)'. * Limia: To Celtic *lƒ´mƒÅ- 'flood', so probably 'The river of the flooded area'.

It flows thought a canyon for much of its course. To *nƒÅwiƒÅ- 'boat (vase, bowl)'. Cf Spanish nava 'valley in between mountains'. Another river, a tributary of the Sil river born by the 1700 meters high mountains of Serra de Queixa, in the province of Ourense, is also named Navea. * Samo:Monteagudo (1999) p. 299 A tributary of the Tambre. To Celtic *sƒÅmo- 'calm, easy, pleasant'. Cf. Middle Irish s√°m 'idem'. * Tambre:Falileyev (2007) s.v. Tamaris Ancient Tamaris. To *tamo- 'dark', so 'Dark river'. Cf. the British rivers Tamar (ancient Tamarus), Thames (Tamesis) and Tamius. Another two Galician rivers bear closely related names (both to *Tam-ikƒÅ): T√¢mega (Tamice, 982):Monteagudo (1999) p. 305 Tributary of the Douro; and T√°moga or T√°mboga (Tamega, 934 CE): Tributary of the Mi√±o. * Rio de Perros (Vernesga, 1078 CE), sub-tributary of the Mi√±o:Monteagudo (1999) p. 309 To *wernes-ikƒÅ, to *werno- 'alder, alder-tree'. = Parishes and Villages = Most of the 3794 parishes, small rural districts, of Galicia continue medieval and Roman villas, frequently founded near, or even on top, of old Iron Age hillforts. Many of these parishes preserve old pre-Latin names.  Composites containing Celtic *-brig- 'hill'  The most frequent element among the Celtic toponyms of Galicia is *brigs,cf. Matasovic (2009) s.v. *brig- meaning 'hill, high place', and by extension 'hillfort'. Usually it is the second element in composite toponyms ending in -bre, -be or -ve,Toponyms ended in -ve, -be generally derive from toponyms ended in -bre / -vre, through metathesis or dissimilation. Cf. Moralejo (2007) p. 39. being cognate of Irish Gaelic br√≠ 'hill', with the same origin: Proto-Celtic *-brigs > -brixs > -bris. A few toponyms ending in -bra proceed from a derivative -brigƒÅ 'hill(fort)', which also originated Breton and Welsh languages bre 'hill'. Some of these toponyms are:In general, and for most of these toponyms: Pr√≥sper (2002) pp. 357-382. * B√©rgoa: village in Ponteareas, and Bregua, village in Culleredo.

They are found in subtropical and temperate oceanic waters globally. The genus contains bioluminescent species. Taxonomy Ommastrephes bartramii belongs to the family Ommastrephidae, subfamily Ommastrephinae. It is the only species belonging to the monospecific genus Ommastrephes. It was first described by the French naturalist, explorer, and artist Charles Alexandre Lesueur in 1821. Russian taxonomists consider the separate spawning populations of Ommastrephes bartramii as subspecies.  Description  Ommastrephes bartramii are easily distinguishable by the presence of an elongated silver-colored band in the middle of the ventral side of the mantle. Adult males usually have a mantle length of , but can reach the maximum length of . Adult females are much larger, usually having a mantle length of around , with the maximum known length being . A freshly caught neon flying squid from Northern Hawaiian waters. The distinctive ventral silver band can be clearly seen. Photograph courtesy of Richard E. Young, Department of Oceanography, University of Hawaii and the Tree of Life Web Project. Their arms do not possess lateral membranes and have 9 to 27 suckers on the ventral sucker series and 10 to 25 suckers on the dorsal sucker series. The left and right third arms have protective membranes greater in width than the arm width. The hectocotylus develops from the left or right fourth arm.Young, Richard E. and Michael Vecchione. 2009.

Accessed January 24, 2011 Another distinguishing characteristic of O. bartramii is the presence of 4 to 7 toothed suckers on the tentacular club, near the nearest carpal suckers of the carpal locking apparatus. This is especially useful in differentiating it from the orangeback flying squid (Sthenoteuthis pteropus). Photophores are present but are small, irregular, and restricted to the ventral side of the mantle, head, and tentacles. Visceral photophores are absent.Young, Richard E. and Michael Vecchione. 2009. Ommastrephinae Posselt 1891. Version 29 November 2009 (under construction). http://tolweb.org/Ommastrephinae/19941/2009.11.29 in The Tree of Life Web Project, http://tolweb.org/ Accessed January 24, 2011 Like other ommastrephids and onychoteuthids known as 'flying squid', neon flying squid are so named for their ability to shoot out of the water, much like flying fishes. They sometimes unintentionally land on the decks of ships. This happens more frequently during rough weather or in the presence of predators in the vicinity, and it is presumed that this behavior is an instinctive response to threat. Flying squid have been observed to engage in behaviors that prolong the time it remains in the air, making it more akin to actual flight than just gliding. Biologists, however, still do not fully understand the exact mechanisms by which the squid become airborne. Nevertheless, the phenomenon is known to happen quite frequently and at least one photographic evidence of Ommastrephes bartramii in flight exists. Distribution and habitat An illustration of Ommastrephes bartramii in the 1870 book Report on the Invertebrata of Massachusetts. Neon flying squid are cosmopolitan, being found in subtropical and temperate waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. They are rarely found in the Mediterranean. \\"Giant squids in the Aegean\\". Ethnos, March 27, 2012. p. 22.

This movement pattern is known as diel vertical migration and is also exhibited by other oceanic organisms. Ecology and biology =Life cycle= Neon flying squid are highly migratory. They have a lifespan of about one year, during which they complete a cyclical migration between their feeding and spawning grounds.McCrae, J. 1994. Oregon Developmental Species: other squid, neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartrami). Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife . Mating occurs when males (who usually achieve sexual maturity earlier in the season) pass spermatophores to the females. The female squid store them in the oral surface of their buccal membrane until they too become sexually mature later in the season and begin to spawn. Spawning is continuous and not seasonal, occurring virtually throughout the year in intermittent spawning events. Each female spawns approximately 350,000 to 3.6 million eggs, depending on their size. Males and females are both presumed to die soon after. Hatchlings are around long and grow rapidly, reaching a length of after a month. The paralarvae migrate northwards toward the waters bordering subarctic regions during summer and autumn. They are usually found feeding at a depth of from the surface. Maturing squid return to the spawning grounds to mate. =Diet and predators= Neon flying squid eat small oceanic fishes (like lanternfishes and saury) and other squids. They are known to engage in cannibalism to smaller members of their own species as well. They serve as prey to large fishes (like swordfish, marlin, and tuna), sharks, and marine mammals. They are also fished commercially for human consumption.

They are found in all oceans and a few rivers and lakes, but most live in warm waters. Altogether, the Gobiinae unite about 1149 described species in 160 genera, and new ones are still being discovered in numbers. Description and ecology They are usually mid-sized to small ray- finned fishes; some are very colorful, while others are cryptic. Most true gobies are less than 10 cm (4 in) long when fully grown. The largest species Glossogobius giuris can reach up to 50 cm (20 in); the smallest known species as of 2010, Trimmatom nanus, is just about 1 cm in length when fully grown, making it one of the smallest vertebrates. In many true gobies, the pelvic fins have grown together into a suction cup they can use to hold on to substrate. Most have two dorsal fins, the first made up from spiny fin rays, while the other has some spines in the front followed by numerous soft rays. They are most plentiful in the tropical and subtropical regions, but as a group are almost cosmopolitan in marine ecosystems. A few species tolerate brackish water, and some ‚Äì Padogobius and Pomatoschistus species ‚Äì even inhabit fresh water. They are generally benthic as adults (the spawn can distribute widely by ocean currents), only Sufflogobius bibarbatus is noted to be quite pelagic throughout its life. Most inhabit some sort of burrow or crevice and are somewhat territorial. In some cases, they live in symbioses with unrelated animals, such as crustaceans. The larger species are fished for food, in some cases on a commercial scale. Many Gobiinae species are popular aquarium fish. Especially popular are the colorful species, some of which are regularly traded. In general, the interesting behavior and bold habits make most true gobies seem attractive pets. However, their territoriality and because even the smallest species are fundamentally carnivorous and need living food to thrive make them not easy to keep (particularly compared to the related family Eleotridae). As typical for oceanic fishes, many Gobiinae tend to be almost impossible to breed in captivity, and some species have become rare from habitat destruction and overfishing.

During the German invasion and occupation of Poland, part of the building was destroyed and its collections were stolen, redistributed, or burned. Its surviving collections are now at the National Library of Poland. History The urn containing ashes of early printed books and manuscripts burnt the fall of the Warsaw Uprising Wincenty Krasi≈Ñski originally founded the library in Opinog√≥ra in 1844. This library consisted of his family archives and developed into one of Poland's best collections of national heritage. In 1930, the library was established at 9 Ok√≥lnik Street. In September 1939, during the German invasion, the central part of the building was destroyed by bombs, damaging the museum, reading room, and reference collection. The collections stored in the stacks survived. Many rare manuscripts from the collection were commandeered by the Germans. During the winter of 1939-1940, library directors met to plan ways to preserve their collections and provide for library workers. The group was led by Professor Ketrzynski, representing the Krasinski Library. Meetings were discontinued after Nazi authorities caught wind of them, but the librarians continued to meet in casual gatherings, and eventually obtained passes to the library buildings and the ability to work there. They collected books from bombed houses and brought them to the libraries for safekeeping. There was a brief period when librarians tried to recover what they could, despite the owner, Count Edward Krasinski, being sent to a concentration camp. At this point, the Krasinski library had the largest collection of musical scores in Warsaw, along with several thousand maps and almost 60,000 prints and drawings. Nazi occupiers founded the Staatsbibliothek Warschau in 1940, merging the collections of the National Library and University Library. Despite the efforts of the librarians, Krasi≈Ñski Library was absorbed into the Staatsbibliothek Warschau in 1941. During the redistribution, its collections were moved to the Staatsbibliothek Warschau, the University Library, SGH and the National Museum. leaving the Ok√≥lnik building with a special collection of around 400,000 items. In September 1944, shortly into the Warsaw Uprising, bombs fell on the Ok√≥lnik building. Sections of the collection burned. People worked for a full day trying to rescue manuscripts. Some books were saved by being thrown out of upper-level windows, while books on the ground floor and basement levels were protected from the flames. In October 1944, after the end of the Uprising, the Germans began burning libraries and continued until the end of the occupation. Krasi≈Ñski Library lost about 150,000 pieces, including some of the rarest materials preserved from the Krasi≈Ñski family collection. Post-World War II After the war, the surviving collections (the largest of which being those on the Napoleonic Wars and November Uprising) were transferred to the National Library of Poland.

The body itself varies in colour and may be pink, red or purple, green or brown. The posterior end of the sac has a small opening that allows newly hatched nymphs to emerge. Some species occur under the bark of the host plant and produce little or no ovisac secretion. The bodies of these are often pink or red. Many species produce galls, including Apiomorpha which feeds on various species of eucalypt and have a complex life cycle.

This vision includes rich, healthy and productive ecosystems actively managed and sustainably used by formerly poor local communities. It also features adaptive people and resilient ecosystems able to cope with global climate change. Mission Generate and implement community- based, enterprise-oriented solutions that conserve biodiversity and improve the livelihoods of the poorest of the poor while bolstering national economic development and addressing climate change. History ANSAB was established in 1992 by Appropriate Technology International, now called EnterpriseWorks/VITA, (a NGO based in Washington DC, United States) and the Ministry of Agriculture of Nepal with the goal, at the time, of raising the living standards of small holder farmers in South Asia. Initial financial support helped create small-scale technology development and extension programs in order to generate knowledge and build capacity in agriculture and forestry. The preliminary projects focused on tissue culture, bio-fertilizer, research and capacity building in Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Philippines and Indonesia.

He and his contemporary, the painter Christian Morgenstern,Andresen (1872) 3, 25. were pioneers in Hamburg of early Realism in painting.Thieme-Becker (1940) 34, 527.  Life  Early Self-portrait A son of a bookkeeper to a Hamburg merchant, Vollmer grew up in humble circumstances.Kegel (1997) 83 (1) 345 and ref. 13. Determined to become a painter against the wishes of his father,Andresen (1872) 3, 24. he became an apprentice to the Suhr brothers who owned a graphic workshop producing panorama prints. Like Morgenstern before him, Vollmer travelled throughout Germany with one of the brothers, Cornelius Suhr, for a year and a half. In 1826 the Hamburg art dealer Ernst Harzen introduced him to Carl Friedrich von Rumohr, a wealthy aristocrat, who was a patron to many young Hamburg artists among them Morgenstern and Otto Speckter. Probably on Rumohr‚Äôs advice Vollmer completed his studies under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. He then moved to Munich from where he undertook journeys to Lake Constance, the Austrian and Swiss Alps, Venice, Le Havre and the Netherlands. In 1839 Vollmer returned to Hamburg and settled there. He lost his eyesight in 1866 Andresen (1872) 3, 27. and died in Hamburg. One of his sons, Johannes Vollmer, was a prominent architect of Protestant churches;Johannes Vollmer his grandson Hans Vollmer was an art historian and encyclopaedist who, for many years, edited the Thieme-Becker K√ºnstler Lexikon.  Work  Hamburg Harbour, 1840 Sepia over pencil, 21 x 26 cm Vollmer‚Äôs landscapes and views of the Hamburg Harbour are neither typical veduta nor are they influenced by Romanticism; they are rather in the tradition of the great Dutch landscape painters of the 17th century, for example of Salomon van Ruysdael. In his best paintings, despite the generally small format, he succeeds through carefully balanced compositions to create a sense of depth and of space. Figures in his drawings and etchings are often minute, only millimetres in size; nevertheless, by use of very fine lines he is able to render vivid depictions of people at work and leisure. Works of Adolph Friedrich Vollmer can be found, among other collections, at the Kunsthalle Hamburg, the Altonaer Museum in Hamburg, the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen and the British Museum. The Philadelphia Museum of Art holds a complete set of his known etchings.

It belonged to the former province of Siteia until that was abolished in 2006. Between 1997 and 2010, it was part of the former Makry Gialos municipality. Today, it is part of Ierapetra municipality. It is located 30 kilometers north-east of Ierapetra, 40 kilometers southwest of Sitia, and six kilometers east of Stavrohori. It can be approached through the famous forest of Pefkoseli. Its patron is Saint Stephen. Saint Stephen church, at the entrance of the village, is an ecclesiastical and historical monument of Crete. Since the last decade, the majority of the population has been moved to the village's seaside settlement of Makry Gialos, some six kilometers to the south. Makry Gialos is one of Crete's most important tourist resorts. The village's previous name was Gras or Greas mentioned by Piero Castrofilaca, the Venetian accountant of Crete in 1583. Castrofilaca recorded in Gras 305 inhabitants that time. The wall is still visible today lay on the north side of the village. The wall standing was part of a larger Venetian fortification build around 1600. It stands on earlier fortifications probably of Byzantine or Saracen origin. Many local surnames today have Venetian roots and that it this increases the possibility that Agios Stefanos was the center of the local government and garrison once. The old name of Agios Stefanos, Grea also indicates a Latin origin (Grea is a North Italian surname). Further north from Agios Stefanos village they are ruins from Venetian built terraces for vineyards, olive groves and other crops. Agios Stefanos today produces around 300tons of olive oil. Sir Arthur Evans passed from the area in 1898 and mentioned the standing walls from a fortress in his diary. The village was the birthplace of Anagnostis Funtalides a Cretan MP in 1879. He and another villager, Emmanuel Kamenakis were the leaders of the 1866 revolution in Sitia against the Ottomans. In Agios Stefanos was also the birthplace of Fundalides son Emmanuel, also an MP in late 19th century.

He was an alderman on Bristol City Council for many years and a member of the Bristol Stock Exchange from 1898. He was a director of a number of public companies including the Metropolitan Cinema Investment Corporation Limited and the British Benzol and Coal Distillation Limited. Woodcock held a commission in the Volunteer Force and its successor the Territorial Force, and in 1911 became commanding officer of the 6th Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment. With the outbreak of war in 1914 he mobilised with the battalion, serving on the Western Front and in Italy. Woodcock was elected at the 1922 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Thornbury division of Gloucestershire, defeating the sitting Liberal MP Athelstan Rendall by a majority only 104 votes (0.3% of the total). However, he lost the seat to Rendall at the next election, in 1923. Woodcock returned to Parliament a year later, when he was elected at the 1924 general election as MP for the Everton division of Liverpool. He held that seat until the 1929 general election, which he did not contest.Craig, page 175 He was appointed in November 1922 as a Deputy Lieutenant of Gloucestershire.

Its goal: to present interactive exhibits, programs, public lectures, and other events for schools and the general public. Building The science center location at Raadhuislaan 11, in Tegelen, the Netherlands, is a historic building that served as the city hall for Tegelen. The historic fa√ßade and many internal architectural details have been preserved. Exhibits A major feature of the center is a mixture of permanent and temporary exhibits that demonstrate scientific and technical principles. Exhibits are labeled in Dutch, English and in German, as the center is within 2 km of the border with Germany, and was designed to host visitors and schools from both countries. The first series of exhibits dealt with energy, light, and gravity. The center integrated science exhibits with art displays inspired by scientific themes. The art shown changes periodically. Science education Before the center moved into the former townhall, Ithaka created science education programs and conferences, such as energy exhibitions, science clubs, school activities, master classes, and other special events. For classroom teachers, the Ithaka Science Center has assembled and provides science activity kits which included instruments, materials and instructions for topics including electricity, air, mechanics, magnetism, properties of solids, liquids and gases. The center has hosted numerous speakers on science, technology, and science education. Among them have been Nobel Laureates George Smoot, Douglas Osheroff, and Eric Maskin. The center has online activities for children, and had produced a children's science exploration television program.

Amongst his friends and colleagues he was widely known by his initials, JBS. He had an instrumental role in the founding of Wycliffe Bible Translators UK;Wycliffe UK obituary, retrieved Jan 24, 2011 the West Africa Linguistics Society and the Forum of Bible Agencies International. He pioneered SIL International's work in several countries in West Africa.  Life and work  =Early life and education= John Bendor-Samuel was born in the British seaside town of Worthing on 9 June 1929, the son of Rev. Theodore Harold and Dorothy Ruth Bendor-Samuel. Both of his parents were church ministers, and his father's ministry commitments led the family to move several times during the early years of John's life: first to Winchester when he was 2 years old, then to Hereford in 1945, followed by a move to West Norwood 4 years later. John himself embraced evangelical Christianity at a young age, and was baptised in June 1943. The academic dedication he was to show in later life was evident from an early age. His father recalled how as a young boy he used to open his schoolbooks and start his homework as soon as he got home from lessons.Thompson, Matched with His Hour, p. 20. This commitment to study continued and at the end of secondary school, he was accepted into Oxford University to study history. Between his secondary education and attending university, Bendor-Samuel had to spend two years doing National Service in the army. As he felt called by God to go into mission work in later life, he expressed a desire to spend his period of service overseas, but this request was declined several times due to his usefulness as an instructor in England. Eventually, he decided to resign from his position, and was able to spend the second year of his National Service in the Middle East. After his National Service was completed, he began studying for his undergraduate degree in history at Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated in 1952 and, spurred by a desire to work in a Bible teaching position oversees, he moved to London University to work towards two postgraduate diplomas, firstly in Education and then in Theology. =Linguistics training and the move abroad= In 1953, while studying for his diploma in theology, he attended a training course run by the Summer Institute of Linguistics at the London Bible College. The first course of its kind in the UK, it was designed to equip prospective and current missionaries to better acquire proficiency in non-European languages. Despite the current pressures on his time, the course appealed to Bendor-Samuel as he was aware of the importance of language learning skills for missionaries. He also had memories of his shortcomings in the discipline earlier in life, remarking that his school language lessons had been \\"dismal and depressing\\" and jokingly admitting that he did not know \\"the difference between a glottal stop and a bus stop\\".Thompson, Matched with His Hour, p. 19. Unable to afford the residential fee for the course, he lived at his parents' house in West Norwood, cycling to and from the College each day and working on completing his theology diploma when he got home at night. By the end of the course, he discovered that he enjoyed linguistics, and was invited to take on a role of organising and publicising the same course for the following year.Thompson, Matched with His Hour, pp. 24-25. As part of this position, Bendor-Samuel essentially turned his attic bedroom into the UK office of Wycliffe Bible Translators.Thompson, Matched with His Hour, p. 25. With the help of his brother David, he also bought a motorcycle and side-car, which he used to travel around areas near London promoting the work of Wycliffe and searching for a location for the next year's course.Thompson, Matched with His Hour, pp. 25-26. Following the 1954 SIL course, which was held in Chigwell, Essex, Bendor-Samuel decided to join Wycliffe Bible Translators.Thompson, Matched with His Hour, pp. 32-34. Encouraged to engage in further linguistics study to equip him for work with Wycliffe, he enrolled on a one-year MA course at the School of Oriental and African Studies before studying for a PhD in Linguistics. Throughout this period, he was also responsible for continued administrative work for Wycliffe from his bedroom.Thompson, Matched with His Hour, p. 35. In January 1955, Bendor-Samuel became engaged to fellow Wycliffe member Pamela Moxham. After their first meeting at the SIL course in 1953, Moxham and Bendor-Samuel had remained friends, with her teaching him some phonetics, and him teaching her how to drive. Initially hesitant about marriage, the new certainty about his future had encouraged Bendor-Samuel to propose. The ceremony took place during that year's SIL course. As Bendor- Samuel had chosen the Jebero language of Peru as the subject of his PhD, the newly married couple travelled to South America in 1955, where they would spend several years working with SIL International.SIL obituary retrieved Jan 24, 2011, retrieved Aug 2018 from archive.org After a year in Peru, collecting phonological and grammatical data on the language and helping to devise an alphabet, they returned to England, where John spent eighteen months working on his thesis. Following his thesis in 1958, he returned to South America with Pam, this time to Mato Grosso, Brazil to study the Terena language. During his years in Peru and Brazil, Bendor-Samuel continued to be involved in the annual SIL courses in England.Thompson, Matched with His Hour, pp. 54-59. =The beginning of work in Africa= Bendor-Samuel's first visit to Africa, where his most extensive and influential work occurred, was in 1960. In response to requests from various African church leaders, and following a particularly emotive plea from a Ghanaian language assistant who interrupted a Council meeting during the 1959 summer course, SIL president George Cowan decided that linguistic and Bible translation work should commence in Africa. Bendor-Samuel was chosen to conduct the initial survey work, and set off for Africa in June 1960. During this initial six-week journey, he visited language groups in Senegal, Portuguese Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana. This initial survey work convinced the Wycliffe International Conference about the idea of expanding their work into Africa, and Bendor-Samuel was chosen to direct this initiative. In November 1961, he returned to Africa on a more permanent basis. The Bendor-Samuels spent the next 20 years living in Africa, first in Ghana and then in Nigeria, but returning to the UK for three months each year to run the SIL training course. A crucial part of Bendor-Samuel's work during his early years in Africa was making contact with key governmental and educational figures. The flourishing of the scholarly study of linguistics in Africa, with the emergence of new university departments, meant that he was able to forge working relationships with many African scholars. The first such agreement came in December 1961, with the Institute of African Studies at the University of Ghana, and a similar agreement was reached with the University of Nigeria soon afterwards. When Wycliffe teams were forced to temporarily leave Nigeria due to the Nigerian Civil War in 1967, Bendor-Samuel used this as an opportunity to supervise the start of SIL work in other west African countries. Later that year, Bendor-Samuel reached an agreement with the University of Cameroon, allowing some workers to be re-allocated to that country with official support.Thompson, Matched with His Hour, pp. 91-97. An encounter with the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire, allowed him to initiate linguistics work in that country as well. By 1969, SIL were also working in Togo. During the 1970s, Bendor-Samuel served as SIL's Africa Area Director. In this role, he was responsible for initiating and guiding SIL work further afield on the continent, in 13 further countries including Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Senegal and the Central African Republic. Bendor-Samuel later described the approach he took in exploring possibilities for expansion into new countries: As well as his supervisory role, Bendor-Samuel was himself involved in linguistic research in Africa, primarily into several Gur and Benue‚ÄìCongo languages. He also founded the West Africa Linguistics Society in 1965, continuing to serve on their council until 1999 and editing their Journal of West African Languages (JWAL) between 1982 and 1993. =Leadership= From 1984, Bendor-Samuel held a number of important leadership positions, beginning with a seven-year term as Executive Vice-President of SIL International. This role necessitated a move to Dallas, Texas, making the 1983 SIL course the last one he directed. The position involved him speaking frequently at conferences, as well as visiting various SIL branches worldwide. Notably, he was invited to speak at the Second International Congress on World Evangelization in Manila in 1989. In 1990 he was a co-founder of the Forum of Bible Agencies, which he established with Fergus MacDonald from the United Bible Societies in an attempt to promote greater cooperation among agencies working in Bible translation and distribution. In 1992, he was elected Director of Wycliffe Bible Translators in the UK, but continued to be involved in the running of the Forum of Bible Agencies, as well as participating in several international conferences. During his term as Director, Bendor-Samuel introduced a number of initiatives, including a model for institutional funding for literacy and language development work; although this project did not have much of an impact in the UK, it was adopted successfully in other European countries. He also introduced a scheme called 'Vision 20', which connected churches in Britain with specific Bible translation projects that they could support. Later operating under the name 'In Focus', this programme continues to be an important part of Wycliffe UK's work. Later, Bendor-Samuel simultaneously served as the president of Wycliffe International. His terms in both of these roles concluded in 1999. In 2000, he was appointed to the role of Wycliffe Africa Area director, to encourage African churches and organisations to support Bible translation in their countries and beyond. For the final few years of his life, Bendor-Samuel was working in SIL's Africa archives, conducting research into the development of the organisation in that continent. =Death= Bendor-Samuel died in hospital following a car accident near his home in Studley Green on the evening of 6 January 2011. His wife Pamela Bendor-Samuel survived him by eight years (1930-2019). He is survived by their 5 children and 15 grandchildren. Influence and legacy The executive director of SIL International, Freddy Boswell, asserted that \\"few people have impacted global language development and Bible translation over the last half century as did our beloved friend and colleague, Dr. John Bendor-Samuel\\". The Forum of Bible Agencies International wrote \\"Few others saw with such clarity and felt with such passion the challenge to render the Word of God into the heart language of the world‚Äôs people groups.\\" John Bendor-Samuel had a particular impact in Africa, where his promotion of national organisations encouraged the establishment of several Wycliffe organisations across the continent. The Nigeria Bible Translation Trust emerged in 1976, and the Ghana Institute of Linguistics, Literacy and Bible Translation was founded three years later. Local translation organisations have also appeared. He also encouraged a number of African linguists, particularly through the West Africa Linguistic Society. He has vigorously encouraged and promoted the formation of national Bible translation organizations in African countries and has promoted partnerships between SIL International and governmental and non-governmental organizations, University departments, church and mission organizations. Bendor-Samuel's belief in the importance of training nationals in linguistic work was underscored by his experiences during the Nigerian Civil War, later writing: > \\"Although from the beginning we had tried to train West Africans, > particularly Nigerians, it was the difficulties that we encountered with the > civil war and then later in the year following it with getting visas that > forced us to give much greater attention and priority to this aspect of our > work\\".Thompson, Matched with His Hour, p. 97.  Publications  In total, Bendor-Samuel wrote one book, co-authored another, contributed several articles to academic journals and wrote 14 articles on Niger‚ÄìCongo language groups for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.This included the article on Niger‚ÄìCongo languages, as well as articles for Adamawa‚ÄìUbangi, Akan, Atlantic, Bantu, Benue‚ÄìCongo, Gur, Igboid, Ijoid, Kordofanian, Kru, Kwa, Mande and Yoruba languages. =Books and monographs= As editor * Ten Nigerian Tone Systems (Jos and Kano: Institute of Linguistics and Centre for the Study of Nigerian Languages, 1974) As author *The Verbal Piece in Jebero (New York: Linguistic Circle of New York, 1961) * (with Paul E. and Ingeborg Meier) A Grammar of Izi, an Igbo Language (Norman: Summer Institute of Linguistics of the University of Oklahoma, 1975) * (with Keir Hansford and Ronald Stanford) An Index of Nigerian Languages (Ghana: Summer Institute of Linguistics, 1976) *John Bendor-Samuel, Rhonda Hartell, 1989, The Niger‚ÄìCongo Languages: a classification and description of Africa's largest language family.

His politics were based, in large part, on stopping the French invasion of New Mexico. Biography =Early life= Antonio Valverde y Cos√≠o was born around 1670 in Villapresente, Cantabria, Spain,New Mexico Office of the State Historian: Antonio de Valverde Cosio.

Genealogies. consulted in may 07, 2011, to 13:09 pm. He was attracted to New Spain by various business interests that his family had in the region. He began working in Sombrerete (in modern Mexico) because minerals had been discovered there in 1646. Over time, he and his associates created an important business in the area. The success of their partnership grew over the next 24 years. In 1693, Diego de Vargas, governor of New Mexico, recruited settlers and soldiers from Sombrerete, and Valverde decided to join them. Eventually, he became Vargas' secretary. From June 1694 to July 1697, Valverde served as a soldier in New Mexico, fighting to impose Spanish authority in New Mexico and restore the region's Hispanic population. Over the next two years (1694‚Äì96), he and Vargas participated in the war against the Puebloan peoples, who had rebelled against Spanish sovereignty because of the maladministration of Juan Francisco Trevi√±o. In December 1695, Valverde was promoted to captain of the local presidio. He participated in many battles in 1696, including an assault on the mesa at Acoma. In early June, he began a military campaign against the Tewa people, who had promoted a Native American revolt along with the Tiwa, Keres, and Jemez people. That same year, Valverde suffered a serious illness, and Vargas gave him permission to travel to Mexico City for treatment. In July 1697, Pedro Rodr√≠guez Cubero replaced Vargas as governor and presented complaints against Vargas and Valverde. Vargas was imprisoned for several years, but Valverde was unaffected because he was in Spain at the time. Valverde and Juan Bautista de Sald√∫a shared the captaincy of the presidio of El Paso, a position Valverde held for the remainder of his life. In 1699,Naylor, Thomas H.; Hadley, Diana; Mardith K. Schuetz-Miller (editors; 1997). The Presidio And Militia On The Northern Frontier of New Spain, Volume 2; part 2. The Central Corridor and the Texas Corridor, 1570-1700. The University of Arizona Press. Page 242. he also became the alcalde of El Paso. He had an estate, including a large farm, in San Antonio de Padua. In addition, he controlled much of the economy of El Paso, along with trade and business in many other parts of New Mexico. In 1705, he became a lieutenant general under Governor Francisco Cuervo y Vald√©s. In 1708, he was named a councilman of Santa Fe. Two years later, in 1710, he attained the rank of general. In 1712 and 1714, he fought against the Suma Indians and Apaches, who had rebelled against the Spanish. = Governorship = Valverde was appointed acting governor of New Mexico in 1716, replacing F√©lix Mart√≠nez. He was replaced in the same year by Juan Paez Hurtado, but regained the position in 1718.Mart√≠nez La√≠nez, Fernando and Canales Torres, Carlos (Fourth edition: September 2009). Banderas lejanas: La exploraci√≥n, conquista y defensa por parte de Espa√±a del Territorio de los actuales Estados Unidos (In Spanish: Far flags. The exploration, conquest and defense by Spain of the Territory of the present United States). Edaf. Page 228-229. In 1719 Valverde led a military expedition against the Comanches and Utes who were raiding Spanish and Pueblo settlements in New Mexico.His force consisted of 60 Spanish soldiers, 45 Spanish settlers, and, as auxiliaries, 465 Pueblo and 165 Apache Indians.Abbot, Carlos (2013). Colorado: A History of the Centennial State, Fifth Edition. University Press of Colorado.) When Valverde and his troops reached the Arkansas River in eastern Colorado, one of the Apaches of El Cuartelejo told him that the French had built two villages on Pawnee lands west of the Missouri River, \\"as big as Taos\\" in New Mexico. He also said that the French were arming the Native Americans to fight the Spanish. He did not encounter any Comanche or Utes during the expedition. On his return to Santa Fe, he sent a report to the viceroy, Baltasar de Z√∫√±iga, concluding that the French were preparing to enter New Mexico and that they were bribing the native tribes with gifts, including firearms. On January 10, 1720, Viceroy Z√∫√±iga ordered Valverde to establish a presidio in the Apache settlement of El Cuartelejo. However, Valverde suggested to the viceroy that Jicarilla, just 40 miles from Santa Fe and with cultivated fields, would be a better choice. He noted that the Apaches of El Cuartelejo (located in present-day western Kansas), allies of the Spanish, were much more distant from Santa Fe and had no supplies, so they could not adequately defend themselves from enemy attacks; Valverde argued that the Spanish should help defend them. Thus, in June 1720, Valverde directed the Villasur expedition to check the growing French influence in the Great Plains and capture French traders there. The expedition of 100 men, including many Pueblo Amerindians, traveled to the confluence of the Loup River and North Platte River in what is now Nebraska. In New Mexico, members of the Pawnee and Otoe tribes attacked with firearms, killing many of the explorers. Valverde finished his term in New Mexico in 1721, when the viceroy of New Spain appointed Juan Estrada de Austria as the new governor of the province. = Last years = Valverde was accused of facilitating the murder of explorers through the Villasur expedition. He was eventually prosecuted and fined 200 pesos, but the prosecution took place only after seven years of investigation. In the interim, Valverde had again become a rancher in El Paso. He lived there until his death on December 15, 1728. He was buried in the mission at Guadalupe del Paso.  Personal life  Although Valverde never married, he had several children: Antonia, Mar√≠a Rosa, Juana, and Antonio de Valverde. He was also the uncle of Juan Domingo Bustamante, who would become governor of Spanish New Mexico. He was one of the wealthiest men in New Mexico, with a hacienda that included large wheat fields, a flour mill, a vineyard, and a farm with sheep, cattle, horses, mules, hogs, and goats. He also had nine black and mulatto slaves and more than 30 farm laborers.

But there was local opposition from other local reformers, who found him unreasonable, notably Johannes Sturm.

There are correspondingly small sizes of shoes for them. In poor populations and tropical countries, children commonly go barefoot. Development The development of children's feet begins in-utero, being mainly derived from basic embryological tissue called mesenchyme. In simple terms, the mesenchyme differentiates to form a cartilage foot template, which is largely complete by the end of the embryonic period (8 weeks after conception). The lower limb buds appear around the 4th embryonic week, slightly later than the upper limb buds, and the developing nervous system is already evident. The blood supply of the foot then begins to infiltrate the tarsal bones, whilst the process of endochondral ossification sees cartilage become bone. Not all of the foot bones are formed at birth. The navicular is the last bone to ossify, occurring between 2 and 5 years of age. The ossification of the cuboid occurs reliably at 37 weeks gestation and its appearance is often used as a marker of foetal maturity. At birth of a ‚Äòfull- term‚Äô baby the average foot length is 7.6 centimetres (range 7.1 ‚Äì 8.7 cm). Foot growth continues to be very rapid in the first 5 years of life; slower development continues until skeletal maturity of the feet, which occurs on average at 13 years in girls and 15 years in boys. Final foot length is achieved before maximum height is reached in both genders. In Imperial China, it was the custom for respectable women to have their feet bound as children. This was started between the ages of five and seven. The feet were bound tightly and forced into increasingly small shoes so that the front part of the foot was bent back and the toes touched the heel. This was done to make the girls marriageable as the tiny feet and the swaying lotus gait which resulted were considered attractive. Gait Children's motor development generally follows the pattern of sitting (around 6 months), crawling (around 9 months) and walking (around 10-16 months), with high normal variability in the ages at which various milestones are reached. The early gait of young new-walking children is distinguished from that of an older child or adult by many features: shortened stride, feet held widely apart, arms held up (‚Äòhigh guard‚Äô assisting balance), apparent sway (coronal plane), and rapid steps (high cadence). More mature gait includes body rotations (transverse plane), longer stride, and lowered arm swing, all of which increase both speed and energy efficiency. Mature gait patterns generally develop around 3 years of age, but again there is a range of normal variation (2 to 6 years). Walking or bipedal gait is usually assessed clinically unless there is a neuromuscular condition, such as cerebral palsy. Laboratory based gait analysis can be very useful for planning treatment regimes, especially surgical management, but also the effects of ankle-foot-orthoses (AFO's) and footwear. Footwear Stride rite. A recent Cochrane Library systematic review includes 11 studies investigating the effects of children's footwear. Children wearing shoes were found to children walk faster by taking longer steps with greater ankle and knee motion and increased tibialis anterior activity. Shoes were also found to reduce foot motion and increase the support (weight-bearing) phases of the gait cycle. During running, shoes were found to reduce swing (non-weight- bearing) phase leg speed, attenuate some shock, and encourage a rearfoot strike pattern. The long-term effect of these gait changes due to footwear on growth and development are currently unknown. The impact of footwear on gait should be considered when assessing children's gait and evaluating the effect of shoe or in-shoe interventions. Children who go barefoot have a lower incidence of flat feet and deformity while having greater foot flexibility than children who wear shoes. Medical problems Children's feet are a frequent presentation to a range of health professionals and represent a common parental concern. Both particular paediatric conditions and foot development results in many changes and variations to foot appearance. It is important that foot problems are differentiated from growing trends, that foot pain is well diagnosed, and that any treatment is based upon best available evidence. plantar view. =Congenital deformity= Congenital foot deformities may be readily identified, e.g. club foot (talipes equino varus). Currently the‚Äògold-standard‚Äô treatment choice for club feet is the Ponseti method. Other treatment options include the French Functional method or a combination of the two methods and some treatment centers also use Botox treatments. Maintaining the correction is challenging as relapses occurs in up to 37% of the feet treated with the Ponseti method and 29% of feet treated with the French Functional method. Surgery are therefore used as a last resort option with recurring club feet presentation. The Ponseti method is used across the globe in both developed and developing countries (where many aid programs, such as \\"Walk for Life\\"walkforlife.org train local health professionals). Congenital foot appearance may also be indicative of a genetic condition; a wider space between the first and second toes with associated skin creasing may be found with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21). =High arches= Pes cavus or high arched feet are an unusual finding in young children. Whilst some cavus foot types are familial and normally inherited, others are indicative of genetic neurological conditions, e.g. Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease or Friedrich's ataxia. The appearance of high arched feet in young children should be noted. =Flat feet= flat feet Relative to the skeletally mature foot structure, it is expected that an infant and young child should display a flat foot posture with a lower medial longitudinal arch and everted heel position. Consistently across many studies, paediatric flat foot posture has been found to reduce with age. Normative data has been compiled from multiple studies using the Foot Posture Index (FPI-6) to show that children's feet become less flat with increasing age, that adult's feet are least flat, and that older people's feet become flatter. The normal findings of flat foot versus children's age estimate 45% of pre-school children, and 15% of older children (average age 10 years) have flat feet. Few flexible flat feet have been found to be symptomatic, hence only painful flat feet should be diagnosed and treated. Increased joint mobility or increased weight may increase flat foot prevalence, independently of age. Treatment of children‚Äôs flat feet Contemporary management of the paediatric flat foot is directed according to pain, age, and flexibility, considering gender, weight, and joint hypermobility. When foot orthoses are indicated, inexpensive generic appliances will usually suffice. The paediatric flat foot proforma (p-FFP) directs this evidence-based approach. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one quasi-RCT have investigated the use of foot orthoses in children. The Cochrane Library systematic review analyzing the studies could not make a single recommendation, concluding that customised foot orthoses should be reserved for children with foot pain and arthritis, for unusual morphology, or unresponsive cases. There is an identified need for further research in this area. Surgery is rarely indicated for paediatric flat foot (unless rigid) and only at the failure of thorough conservative management.

This benign tumor made by connective tissue and fibroblast is largely observed in the ventricles of the heart. The left ventricle is the most common location of cardiac fibroma and accounts for approximately 57% of cardiac fibroma cases followed by the right ventricle with 27.5% of cases. Symptoms of the disease depend on the size of the tumor, its location relative to the conduction system, and whether it obstructs blood flow. Two-thirds of children with this tumor are asymptomatic, showing no signs and symptoms. Therefore the cause of cardiac fibroma is unexplained but has been associated with Gorlin Syndrome. Echocardiography is the primarily diagnostic method used to detect if an individual has cardiac fibroma. Resection of the tumor is recommended however heart transplantation is done if surgery is not possible. Overall prognosis of resection is favorable and the chance of recurrence is scarcely reported.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms in cardiac fibroma are nonspecific, some individuals experience arrhythmias, dyspnea, cyanosis, chest-pain and sudden mortality. In addition, the majority of individuals with cardiac fibroma are asymptomatic therefore leading to signs and symptoms that depend on the size and location of the tumor. Tumors range from millimeters to extensive tumors in the range of 12.5 x 10.0 x 8.5 cm. For instance, individuals with larger tumors due to cardiac fibroma which include the conduction system of the heart can demonstrate cardiac dysrhythmias as a symptom.  Cause  The cause of cardiac fibroma is still unknown. However, some tumors have been found to be associated with Gorlin syndrome which is also known as Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS). NBCCS is a genetic condition that affects various parts of the body and increases the possibility of acquiring distinct cancerous and non cancerous tumors.  Mechanism  The mechanism behind cardiac fibromas is still unclear. Fibromas have a homogeneous mass of fibroblasts mixed with an abundance of collagen and elastic fibers. These masses represent mesenchymal growth, but lack other mesenchymal elements, such as blood vessels, cartilage bone, and muscle. These masses often entrap cardiomyocytes, which are muscle cells that make up the cardiac muscle; cells decrease while collagen content increase in these masses. The growth of cardiac fibromas are also slow and produce detrimental physical effects. This is due to infiltration and replacement of myocardium which protrude into the cavity of the heart. These tumors usually occur within the anterior wall of the left ventricle or the interventricular septum and rarely involves the right ventricle. Large fibromas bulge into the cavity of the chamber, interfering with the functions of heart valves and blood flow through the heart. When the left ventricular is obstructed, the outflow tract may give rise to a failed diagnosis of congenital subaortic stenosis. Moreover, it can cause severe congestive heart failure. Cardiac fibromas may present lymphocyte and monocyte aggregates, as well as areas of calcification, which are shown on a chest x-ray or CT scan. The dimensions of these masses and the location cause clinical symptoms.  Diagnosis  Early and precise diagnosis of cardiac fibroma can lead to healing and avoidance of surgery. Echocardiography is the preferred initial method of diagnosis for cardiac fibroma. This is due to the exams non-invasiveness, reduced cost and extensive availability. Echocardiography depicts the morphologic appearance, region and motion of the tumor. On the other hand, additional examinations such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are also conducted for additional diagnostic information. The CT exam provides precise spatial resolution of the tumor meanwhile an MRI provides a comprehensive overview of tissue characterization and does not expose the patient to radiation. Tumor biopsy is utilized in cardiac fibroma as the gold standard to confirmation a patient diagnosis with cardiac fibroma. Family medical history and physical examination of an individual is also used as a diagnostic method, close examination of the heart is concluded along with careful detection of any abnormal heart sounds.  Treatment Cardiac fibroma is commonly treated through surgical excision procedures. The removal of the cardiac tumor requires open heart surgery. During surgery, the tumor and tissues around it is removed to reduce the risk of the tumor returning. Recovery after surgery is between 4‚Äì5 days in the hospital and 6 weeks in total. An echocardiogram is taken every year after the surgery to make sure the tumor has not returned or formed any new growth. On the other hand, if surgery is not possible, a heart transplantation is required.  Prognosis  Cardiac fibromas in infancy which are unable to be removed surgically due to size and extensive myocardial infiltration, have a poor prognosis. The is due to the high ratio of tumor-to- heart size that may produce low cardiac output and as a result lead to a poorer prognosis. As a result, defibrillator implantation or cardiac transplantation may be required. However, tumors that are able to be surgically removed even incompletely have a good prognosis. Long-term survival after surgical resection is favorable, and the chance of recurrence is scarcely reported.  Epidemiology  Cardiac fibromas account for 12%-16% of primary cardiac tumors in children. Therefore, leading it to be the second most common benign cardiac tumor in children. However, it has rarely been found in adults but mainly found in infants under the age of one.  Research directions  Literature Survey on Epidemiology and Pathology of Cardiac Fibroma: During this study, researchers searched through the literature databases on cardiac fibroma to find factors that predict poor outcomes that lead to death. Researchers found that patients who did not survive were significantly younger than those who did survive. These results suggest that younger individuals diagnosed with cardiac fibroma are associated with a poorer outcome. Researchers found no significant difference between the maximum diameter of the tumor between age groups. However, although younger individuals have smaller hearts, the high ratio of tumor-to-heart sizes may generate low cardiac output, which leads to a poor outcome. In addition, literature revealed that 18 of 178 patients with cardiac fibroma were diagnosed during prenatal and neonatal periods, resulting in the tumor having a certain size regardless of the child's age. These findings suggest that cardiac fibromas may be a congenital disorder. Successful Surgical Excision of a Large Cardiac Fibroma in an Asymptomatic Child: A 3-year-old girl, who was asymptomatic, underwent a successful surgical excision of a large cardiac fibroma. The individual had frequent coughs, and therefore underwent several diagnostic exams to diagnose the cause of her frequent cough. A cardiac mass was found on the echocardiograph and later was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The cardiac mass was monitored and after 24 hours, it showed sinus rhythms of normal variability. In addition, the mass dimensions were 38 X 28 mm in the apical area of the left ventricle. A surgical procedure was recommended due to the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The surgery was a success and physicians were able to remove the entire tumor without any complications. Follow-up evaluations at six-months and a year showed the patient in good health and no signs of tumor recurrence. Primary Cardiac Tumors in Children: A Center's Experience: The Department of Cardiac Surgery Children's Hospital in China conducted a study to analyze different characteristics and outcomes of pediatric patients who have primary cardiac tumors treated in their center. They had sixteen patients with primary cardiac tumors between the ages of 1‚Äì13 years. All patients were diagnosed by echocardiography, MRI, and CT. 15 of the 16 patients were able to get successful remove of their mass and one patient had partial resection. However, one patient did died during surgery due to low cardiac output syndrome after five days of their initial surgery to remove their mass. The pathological examination of the cardiac masses showed that rhabdomyoma is the most frequent tumor in children, followed by myxoma and fibromas; morbidity of rhabdomyomas and fibromas were reported higher in infancy, while myxomas were more frequent in older children.

It occupied the south-western corner of the North Island, extending south from the Waikanae River and lying to the west of the summits of the Rimutaka Ranges. The county's name arises from the fact that a large amount of its land area lies in the Hutt River catchment. The county initially had 8 ridings : Belmont, Epuni, Horokiwi, Makara, Mungaroa, Porirua, Wainui-o-mata and Whareroa.Hutt County Council The Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Wellington Provincial District], The Cyclopedia Company, Limited, 1897, Wellington. Retrieved from The New Zealand Electronic Text Centre on 24 January 2011. By 1895, each riding elected one councillor, except Porirua, which elected two, to the Hutt County Council. One of the elected councillors was appointed as chairman of the Council. Hutt County was administered by the Hutt County Council, which was first established in 1876, but it was eventually dissolved in 1989 when local government was reformed and the few remaining constituent ridings were amalgamated into adjacent cities. Between 1908 and 1962 the Makara Riding was separately administered as Makara County. During its time, several towns, boroughs, districts, and eventually cities developed within the county. While the town of Wellington was already a separately incorporated local body at the time the county was established, its jurisdiction did not then extend beyond the town belt on the hills around Lambton Harbour. The boroughs of Melrose, Onslow, Karori, Miramar, Johnsonville and Tawa Flat initially developed in parts of Hutt County just outside Wellington. Those boroughs were eventually incorporated into Wellington city, as the county that had been the Makara Riding later was, after Porirua became a borough in 1961 and a city in 1965. In the Hutt Valley towns developed into boroughs at Eastbourne, Petone, Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt, with the latter two eventually becoming cities. As these urban areas developed and grew, the urbanised areas of Hutt County were incorporated into these cities and boroughs. Despite this, significant communities also developed in Stokes Valley north-east of Lower Hutt, the Wainuiomata valley east of Lower hutt, and Heretaunga‚ÄìPinehaven in the southern part of the Upper Hutt basin. Small coastal communities on the Kapiti Coast were established early on, though major development around Paraparaumu and Waikanae was not significant until the 1970s and 1980s after land closer to Wellington had been developed. By 1989, Hutt County had become so fragmented that the only reasonable reform (as part of the abolition of all mainland counties) was to incorporate the various remaining communities into adjoining cities.

Taking the form of a spiky shrub up to 1.5 m tall with abundant yellow-orange pea flowers typical of Fabaceae, P. juniperina is widespread across southeast Australia, particularly present in southeast Victoria and across Tasmania.  Taxonomy  = Family = P. juniperina is a plant classified in the family Fabaceae, sometimes known as Lguminosae or simply the legume, bean or pea family. This family is large and widely distributed with 751 genera and approximately 19,000 known species encompassing trees and shrubs as well as perennial and annual herbaceous plants. = Genus = P. juniperina belongs to the genus Pultenaea known commonly as the bush peas and named after British physician and botanist Richard Pultney (1730-1801) = Species = The specific name juniperina means juniper like, and is attributed to the species to its spiky foliage resembling that of a juniper plant. = Subspecies = P. juniperina has been classified into several subspecies including the following: * var. juniperina Labill. * var. latifolia * var. leiocalyx * var. mucronata * var. planifolia * var. uniflora P. juniperina plant in Sandfly, Tasmania, showing leaf morphology thumb  Morphology  = Habit/stems = An erect shrub growing to over 1 m in height with a highly branched habit, stems terete exhibiting hairs when young which range from spreading to curled. = Leaves = Leaf dimensions range from 5‚Äì30 mm long and 1.5‚Äì2.5 mm wide, and are observed to be simple, alternate and evergreen. Their shape is highly variable, commonly occurring as linear, narrow elliptic or narrow obovate but always exhibiting a spiky aristate apex. Leaf margins are flat to recurved, with the abaxial (lower) surface a darker shade than the adaxial (upper) surface. Leaf blades occur at right angles to the petiole, which is short and appressed to the stem, with pointed, soft, brown stipules occurring at the leaf base. = Pods = The species exhibits hairy pods 6-8 mm in length, turgid, with lower half enclosed by calyx. = Flowering = P. juniperina exhibits characteristic pea flowers typical of the family Fabaceae, which are yellow to orange, often with darker reddish markings. Flowers are axillary, occurring on short lateral branches and ranging from terminal to apparently terminal, often clustered. Flowers are 7‚Äì13 mm long with 2‚Äì3 mm pedicels and glabrous to glabrescent sepals 4‚Äì7 mm in length, usually fused. Bracts are approximately 2 mm long, 2‚Äì3 lobed, ovate, subulate, keeled, persistent and glabrous. Bracteoles vary from 1.5‚Äì3 mm in length and are ovate to lanceolate in shape. They lack stipules and are ovate, acuminate, hairy and attached at the base of the calyx tube. Lobes acuminate to acute with ciliate margins, and ovaries visibly hairy.  Variation  It has long been known that there is a great deal of diversity within P. juniperina, with the species being divided into several subspecies. These include var. uniflora and var. forsythiana identified by the National Herbarium of New South Wales var. planifolia, described by H. B. Williamson in \\"A revision of the genus Pultenaea, Part II\\", and var. mucronata which is considered its own species in Victoria named Pultenaea forsythiana. The variation in P. juniperina is predominantly exhibited in differing leaf characteristics as identified by prominent Tasmanian botanist Winifred Curtis in her 1942 paper \\"Variations in Pultenaea juniperina Labill\\". The wide-leaved P. juniperina variant latifolia, distinguished by nineteenth-century English botanist George Bentham, is used by Curtis to illustrate the range of leaf morphologies observed within the species.  Distribution  P. juniperina is native to southeast Australia and found in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. In Victoria the species occurs in heathland and heathy understorey in the wet forests of the Grampians as well as a disjunct population near Tonumbuk. In New South Wales it predominantly occurs in wet Eucalypt forests with sandy soil on granite in the far east. Tasmania exhibits extensive populations across the state in both dry and wet Eucalypt forests.  Ecology  Generally P. juniperina operates as a key understorey species in both wet and dry eucalypt forests. The species also plays a significant role in ecosystem nutrient cycling, as it is a known \\"nitrogen fixer\\". Nitrogen fixing plants such as P. juniperina form symbiotic relationships with microorganisms in their roots, which operate to convert nitrogen into forms which can be utilized by the plant.

Working closely in cooperation with businesses, trade bodies and trade unions, they aim to help employers develop high quality internship schemes with recruitment based on merit, and payment that complies with employment law. They also work with interns to ensure they receive the pay they are potentially entitled to by law. They believe that unpaid internships are exploitative, exclusive and unfair. By asking people to work without pay, employers exclude those with talent, ambition and drive who cannot afford to work for free. They campaign that employers and young people alike benefit from the best graduates getting the best jobs. They argue that paying interns a fair wage can ensure that this happens.  Policies  Much of Intern Aware‚Äôs argument focuses on how interns fit into the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Main proposal ‚Ä¢ (Excluding existing exemptions) the UK Government should designate anyone who has undertaken a period of work experience for over four weeks to be a ‚Äúworker‚Äù under the meaning of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) Act.

Original manuscript of \\"Autumn Song\\" by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 1848, in the Ashley Library. The Ashley Library is a collection of original editions of English poets from the 17th century onwards, including their prose works as well as those in verse, collected by the bibliographer, collector, forger, and thief Thomas James Wise. The library was sold to the British Museum by his widow, Frances Louise Greenhaigh Wise, in 1937 for ¬£66,000. It was named after the street in which Wise lived when he started the collection (Ashley Road, Hornsey Rise). Scope The Ashley Library is recognized as one of the most important collections of 19th-century English literary manuscripts. The collection spans the period from Coleridge to Conrad, with the emphasis on poetical manuscripts and the correspondence of writers, critics, collectors, and bibliographers. The collection is strong in manuscripts of the Younger Romantics and of the Pre-Raphaelites, together with Swinburne. Wise's lack of scholarship and his practice of dispersing related manuscripts throughout the collection, made it a particularly difficult library to catalog . History The original collection consisted of 7,000 volumes with the bookcases used to hold them. When the British Museum library cataloged the collection it was discovered that 200 volumes were missing, it is thought that these were sold by Wise in the 1920s. Part of the collection was pre-restoration drama which Wise had been collecting since 1900. These works were compared with the British Museum's former collection at which point it was discovered that over 200 book leaves were missing and 89 of these matching leaves were found in the Wise volumes. Henry Wrenn had built up a drama collection (housed in the University of Texas) and Wise had helped with supplying these volumes, when the Texas authorities sent relevant volumes for comparison, 60 of these books were also found to have been completed with thefts from the British Museum library. Though allegations were published against Wise of theft and forgery in 1934, it was not until 1959 that a detailed scientific investigation was published by the Bibliographic Society. The conclusion supported the theory that Wise must have known that some of the books leaves added to his collection were stolen and that it was probable that he would have taken the leaves himself.

It Opened in 1884, and it forms part of the Battipaglia‚ÄìReggio di Calabria railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. The station's main line train services are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. As the main point of arrival and departure of rail passengers between the mainland and Sicily, the station is a rail facility of national importance. In terms of passenger movements, it is the second busiest station in the Reggio Calabria urban area, and one of the busiest in the region. Additionally, it is a transit point for all of the goods transported by rail between the mainland and Sicily. Location Villa San Giovanni railway station is situated at Piazza Stazione, at the western edge of the town centre. It occupies Villa San Giovanni's waterfront area, between the town centre and the ferry terminal for ferries to Sicily. History The station was opened on 20 May 1884, together with the rest of the long section of the Southern Tyrrhenian railway between Reggio Calabria Lido (then named Reggio Calabria Succursale) and Villa San Giovanni. Soon afterwards, the construction company, the Societ√† Vittorio Emanuele,:it:Societ√† Vittorio Emanuele handed over the facility to the new Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate del Mediterraneo (). The latter company eventually completed the Southern Tyrrhenian railway in 1895. In that year, the importance of the station grew significantly, because for travellers coming from Sicily it was more convenient to take a ferry straight to Villa San Giovanni than to travel, as before, via the port of Reggio Calabria. On 1 March 1905, the station was connected by a new short railway with the Villa ferry port. This development facilitated the introduction of ferry services carrying railway rolling stock. As time went on, the importance of Villa San Giovanni gradually increased, to the detriment of Reggio Calabria, as the Tyrrhenian rail route to central and northern Italy was shorter than the alternative route via the Jonica railway. Movement of rail traffic across the Strait of Messina was also increased and strengthened by the introduction of Villesi cradles. The passenger building was built in 1937, as a project of architect Roberto Narducci. Train services The station is served by the following service(s): *High speed services (Frecciargento) Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Reggio di Calabria *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Messina - Palermo *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Messina - Siracusa *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Reggio di Calabria *Night train (Intercity Notte) Rome - Naples - Messina - Siracusa *Night train (Intercity Notte) Milan - Messina - Siracusa *Night train (Intercity Notte) Turin - Reggio di Calabria *Regional services (Treno regionale) Cosenza - Lamezia Terme - Rosarno - Villa San Giovanni - Reggio di Calabria *Metropolitan services (Treno regionale) Rosarno - Villa San Giovanni - Reggio di Calabria - Melito di Porto Salvo Features Six tracks at the station are used for passenger services.

Biographical information  He studied at Bangor University under the supervision of Andrew Lewis completing a doctorate in mixed electroacoustic and instrumental music in 2010 Edward Wright is actively composing and recording. He lives in North Wales with his partner and daughter. Wright's life was hit by tragedy when his father committed suicide in 2017, deeply affecting his next major work Space to Think.  Performance and broadcast  Wright has performed widely thought the UK and abroad including performances in SARC (Belfast), Electroacoustic Cymru (Wales), St. James Piccadilly (London), Art Forum (Antwerp), ICMC2012 (Slovenia), California State University New Music Festival, NYCEMF (USA) & Toronto Electroacoustic Symposium (Canada). His work is characterised (although not exclusively) by the use of electronic resources especially surround and octophonic sound diffusion systems. Although his output remains somewhat melodic in comparison to many comparable acousmatic compositions, Wright's work has become increasingly driven by philosophical, rather than specifically musical content, as demonstrated in more recent pieces such as Thinking inside the Box and Crosswire; the emphasis is more on the multisensory experience of the music and the underlying discourse rather than a particular tune or melody. During his time completing his thesis Wright worked on a number of broadcast projects including the tape part and realisation of Stereo Type for Guto Puw broadcast on S4C television in 2005 as part of the Bangor New Music Festival, also appearing on S4Cs Sioe Gelf with a workshop with pupils from Ysgol PendalarS4C television Sioe Gelf 15/4/08, and work being played on BBC Radio 1 Wales Introducing BBC Radio 1 Wales Introducing 5/6/09. His work first achieved international recognition in the IMEB Prix Bourges 2008 for his piece 'Con-chords' IMEB Prix Bourges. He has since gone on to sign to the Blipfonica record label Blipfonica and has released two CDs in the past two years, as well as contributing to the Journal of Creative Studies,Creative Industries Journal: Vol 4 issue 1 the Composers of Wales Newsletter,Composers of Wales Newsletter Spring 2013 and Electronic Music Wales. He also did sound for the Conwy Food Festival, Art Video.  Software development  Wright initially developed software within the Max/Msp/Jitter and Csound environments as a way of creating methods to perform otherwise impossible music, as in the case of the 8 channel audio/video mixer devised for 'Harp Set', and the sample/processing/difussion system of 'Polarities'. These have quickly become outmoded as live/electronic mixed music has become more mainstream. Wright's approach to software design as a method of interfacing with the digital world during live performance brings software design (as in the case of 'Crosswire' and 'Sound games') closer to instrument building, focusing on methods of physical interaction e.g. mouse, Wii Remote and motion tracking controls which provide a wide range of expression yet demand the precision of physical control expected by an instrumental performer. As well as his performance software Wright has also released a number of composition tools Virtual440 Audio Machine VAM 1 which are available to download in the Max (software) environment.  Collaborations  Wright has worked collaboratively with a number of artists, most especially the photographer and poet Morlo Bach under the title of Virtual Poetry for: 'Passage, In memory of Thomas/Celtic Cross' and 'Broken Glass', and with the author Graeme Harper on 'Seasons'. He also worked on Stereo Type for Guto Puw see above. As part of the Conwy Blinc digital arts festival he also worked with Tim Pugh & Wendy Dawson, Helen Booth and Dominic McGill.

Three of them were hanged in Jemez, Namb√© Pueblo, and San Felipe, while others were flogged, imprisoned, and publicly humiliated. When some of the Native American leaders heard of what had happened in the Pueblo villages, they sent their men to Santa Fe demanding the release of detainees. Taking advantage of the fact that most of the governor's soldiers were away fighting the Apaches,Cronolog√≠a hist√≥rica. about 70 Native American warriors surrounded the governor's palace and stormed inside, capturing Trevi√±o. In exchange for his freedom, Trevi√±o freed the imprisoned men. Among the Pueblos who were released was the religious leader, Pop√©, who after his release, began planning a revolt against the Spanish. Upon receiving news that the Pueblos were again building kivas, Trevi√±o ordered Franciscan missionaries to begin an investigation. On September 24, 1675, Trevi√±o sent soldier Juan Dominguez de Mendoza to the Navajo lands leading a group of 40 Spanish men and 300 Pueblo auxiliaries. In the conflict, the troops killed and captured many Navajos, freed the Spanish and Pueblo prisoners, and destroyed other possessions. He renamed Zia Pueblo as \\"Plaza de Armas\\", and converted it to an assembly and mustering place for the Spanish troops.Simmons, Marc; Esquibel, Jos√© (2012).

The New Mexican population also had troubles with the Apaches who destroyed agricultural lands and churches in New Mexico. In June 1676, Lieutenant Governor Tom√© Mendoza (who was brother of Juan Dominguez de Mendoza) was ordered to form an expedition against the Apaches who were attacking the Socorro and Senec√∫ Pueblo areas. Juan de Mendoza was appointed as commander of these troops by Trevi√±o. After two more years of governance in New Mexico, Trevi√±o retired in 1679 and was replaced by Antonio de Otermin.

Commissioned and produced by the BBC, it was first broadcast on 30 December 2009, on BBC One. The novella was adapted for the screen by Sandy Welch, and the film was directed by Tim Fywell. Although generally true to the tone and story of James's work, the film is set in the 1920s‚Äîin contrast to the original 1840s setting‚Äîand accentuates sexual elements that some theorists have identified in the novella. The film's story is told in flashbacks during consultations between the institutionalised Ann (Michelle Dockery) and Dr Fisher (Dan Stevens). Ann tells how she was hired by an aristocrat (Mark Umbers) to care for the orphans Miles (Josef Lindsay) and Flora (Eva Sayer). She is met at the children's home, Bly, by Mrs Grose (Sue Johnston), the housekeeper. Ann soon begins to see unknown figures around the manor, and seeks an explanation. Critics were divided in their reviews of The Turn of the Screw. The acting and tone of the production were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story has been much analysed owing to its ambiguity, and critics disagreed about the extent to which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. The Turn of the Screw was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America. Production The BBC had previously adapted several horror stories as Christmas films, with their series A Ghost Story for Christmas including adaptations of the M. R. James stories \\"The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral\\" (filmed as The Stalls of Barchester), \\"A Warning to the Curious\\", \\"Lost Hearts\\", \\"The Treasure of Abbot Thomas\\" and \\"The Ash Tree\\". The Turn of the Screw fits into this \\"mini-genre\\" of the Christmas horror film. The BBC executive and drama commissioner Ben Stephenson, discussing The Turn of the Screw, said that \\"Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without a ghost story for the adults to watch in front of the fire when the children are in bed, and they don't get more chilling than this bold reimagining of the classic Henry James tale.\\" The film was commissioned by Stephenson and Jay Hunt, then controller of BBC One. It was directed by Tim Fywell, and produced by Colin Wratten; the executive producer was Jessica Pope. alt=A faded monochrome photograph of a man leaning on a table. The film is an adaptation of Henry James's 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw. As one of his more popular stories, it had already been adapted for films and television many times, although not previously by the BBC. The adaptation was screenwritten by Sandy Welch, who set the film in the early 1920s, in contrast to the novella's 1840s setting. This allowed the introduction of the Freudian psychiatrist interviewing the main character; this framing device is not used by James, but both the novella and the film share a first-person narrator. The updated setting also allowed the First World War to account for the lack of male staff at the house. The Freudian and libidinous elements some literary theorists have seen in James's story are particularly prevalent in the film, with Ann's repressed sexual feelings for the Master resulting in a number of highly sexual sequences. Further, Welch added a theological element not present in James's story; Ann's father is a preacher, although Ann herself is unsure of her faith. The psychiatrist, by contrast, is an atheist. When he asks Ann about her faith, she replies that she believes in the Devil. The changes to the story were mostly superficial, and the adaptation generally mirrors the novella's tone. The television critic Matthew Baylis observed that the film creates unease and horror through distortions of reality, and that The Turn of the Screw is not a \\"screaming-banshees-and-horrible-corpses style of ghost story\\". The film utilises subtle horror, including details such as a broken doll on a window ledge, and the fact that viewers never discover certain elements of the story (for example, it is never revealed why the character Miles has been suspended from his boarding school). This, for Baylis, ties to the title of the film: \\"it's the writer who puts the screw in the hole and the best ones ask the audience to turn it themselves\\". The Turn of the Screw was filmed on location in the West Country of England, beginning in August 2009. The scenes at Bly were filmed at Brympton d'Evercy, a manor house near Yeovil, Somerset. Brympton was chosen because of its similarity to Bly House, as described by James, including its extensive grounds and large lake. The railway scenes were filmed at the East Somerset Railway. The Turn of the Screw starred Michelle Dockery as Ann, Sue Johnston as Mrs Sarah Grose, Dan Stevens as Dr Fisher, Mark Umbers as the Master, Nicola Walker as Carla, Edward MacLiam as Peter Quint and Katie Lightfoot as Emily Jessel. Corin Redgrave, who played the professor, was the son of Michael Redgrave, who starred in The Innocents, a 1961 adaption of The Turn of the Screw. The children, Flora and Miles, were played respectively by Eva Sayer and Josef Lindsay. However, due to the sexual content of the film, the child actors did not attend the preview screenings. =Broadcast and release= The Turn of the Screw was first shown at 9 pm on BBC One on 30 December 2009, as part of the BBC's Christmas 2009 season. It has since been broadcast on other BBC channels and on Drama. In the UK, the film was released on DVD on 1 March 2010, and distributed by Acorn Media UK. The DVD was rated \\"15\\" by the British Board of Film Classification for \\"infrequent scenes of strong sex\\". The film was released on DVD for the North American market as Ghost Story: The Turn of the Screw on 28 April 2015. The DVD was unrated and had no extra features. Foreign language versions of the film include television screenings or DVD releases of the film in German (Schloss des Schreckens), Finnish (Ruuvikierre) and Polish (W kleszczach lƒôku). Plot The film's story is told in a series of flashbacks interspersed with discussions between Ann (Dockery), a patient in a sanatorium, and Dr Fisher (Stevens), a sceptical and atheistic psychiatrist. Despite the suggestion of his superior (Redgrave) that he focus upon soldiers who have returned from the First World War, Fisher wishes to help Ann if he can. In flashbacks, Ann is hired by a wealthy and sophisticated aristocrat (Umbers) to act as a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with any problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff‚Äîled by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper‚Äîand then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well-behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely hoping that he will visit. Ann discovers that her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), is buried in Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures of a young man and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly affected by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused. Ann believes the figures to be the ghosts of Quint and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and Flora. However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved in the activities of Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with a figure alternating between Quint and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and Flora away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront Quint. The pair are scared, but when Quint arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that Quint leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in his own voice) tells the ghostly Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp. Ann is found some time later by the police, clutching Miles's dead body, but she refuses to speak of what happened until meeting Dr Fisher. He seems to accept Ann's story, unconvinced by his own psychosexual explanations of her visions. Fisher is dismayed to see Ann led away by the police, accused of Miles's murder, and he sees Quint's face on one of the officers. The film closes with a new governess arriving at Bly.

The film was praised by Matt Baylis, writing in The Express, as one of the better adaptations of James's story. The Timess David Chater, although he did not consider the film \\"terrifying\\" or \\"suppurate[d] in evil\\", found it \\"never less than absorbing\\", suspecting this would be particularly so for viewers unfamiliar with the story. The Daily Telegraphs Simon Horsford felt that The Turn of the Screw \\"might not work on all levels but it is an unsettling interpretation nonetheless\\". By contrast, Tom Sutcliffe, writing in The Independent, was unimpressed with the film, considering James's novel to have been \\"comprehensively vandalised\\", while Richard Whittaker, writing in The Austin Chronicle, felt that the film was \\"a particular and peculiar misfire\\" from Welch. The Turn of the Screw was chosen as \\"pick of the day\\" in The Sunday Times, despite the reviewer, Victoria Segal, expressing her view that the film was \\"far from perfect\\". But she added that the flaws could be overlooked, and although there are times \\"when it grinds through the gears with a clunk and clatter\\", the \\"spirit\\" of James's story is retained. Several other critics praised the way that the film had kept the tone of James's story and the subtle approach to horror. This subtlety, according to a review in the Western Morning News, hit \\"exactly the right note of terror\\", and the film was praised as genuinely scary by some critics. Whittaker, though generally critical of the film, felt it strongest when focussed on the house, children and ghosts. Paul Whitelaw, writing in The Scotsman, commended Welch and Fywell for sustaining a horrific atmosphere, and noted that the soundtrack added to the horror. For him, even the use of horror clich√©s was effective, contributing to the film's atmosphere. The Guardian's Phil Hogan expressed a contrary opinion: while he thought The Turn of the Screw \\"exquisitely turned out\\", he felt the film's use of clich√©s limited the extent to which it was actually scary. In a review for The Leader-Post, Andy Cooper praised the \\"creepy atmosphere\\" and tension, but said that the film \\"[fell] short in the chills department\\" and \\"could have done with a few jolts of terror to breathe more life into it\\". The divergences from the original novella's plot were generally not well received. Tim Teeman, reviewing The Turn of the Screw for The Times, felt the 1920s setting did not contribute to the story, as it was not properly developed. He compared the film to Sarah Waters's novel The Little Stranger, a ghost story set in the 1920s in which the social upheavals of the decade are explored. Gerard Gilbert, writing both for The Independent and The Arts Desk, felt that Ann's relationship to the Master was \\"unnecessarily sexed up\\", and that this element added nothing to the story, and, in fact, detracted from it. In his review of the American DVD release for the Deseret Morning News, Chris Hicks said that he could not see why the changes had been made, and that the literalisation of the sex and violence detracted from the film. Whittaker suggested that The Turn of the Screw was \\"oddly sexually explicit\\", and that the changes were unnecessary for the plot. The biggest problem, he suggested, was the introduction of the psychiatrist; his discussions with Ann, which could easily be removed, served to remove the mystery from the plot, in Whittaker's eyes. Sutcliffe was critical of the reframing of the story as a stereotypical account of how \\"a cocky young man of science has his certainties upturned\\", and said the film took \\"the terrifying indeterminacies of the original\\", turning them \\"into a slightly shabby ghost-train ride\\". Critics disagreed about how successful the film was in capturing the novel's ambiguity, which is part of the enduring appeal of James's story. For Tim Dowling, a columnist for The Guardian, the film failed in this regard. The novella, Dowling explained, can be understood as a straightforward ghost story, but it can also be understood as a story about Ann's madness, and there is further ambiguity concerning whether the children are being controlled by Quint and Jessel, or whether the children are controlling Ann. He suggested that \\"there's probably a subtlety to all this ambiguity on the page which, when translated to the screen, just looks like having it both ways.\\" As a result, \\"the narrative was at times more evasive than ambiguous\\". Whittaker felt that the film failed to appropriately present the novella's ambiguity and implicit themes, saying that the adaptation \\"feels oddly obligated to fill in all those blanks, and it's really the script's fault\\". Sutcliffe expressed a similar view; for example, he noted that \\"when the governess sees Quint on the tower for the first time so do we, and the thing that really haunts us as we read the story‚Äîuncertainty‚Äîvanishes to be replaced by a much duller kind of fretfulness, about when something is next going to pop out at us.\\" By contrast, Chater and Teeman (both writing for The Times) felt the ambiguity of the film was praiseworthy, with Chater asking whether the ghosts truly exist or are just a manifestation of \\"hysterical imagination\\", and Teeman suggesting that viewers will be more likely to believe (with Dr Fisher) that Ann's retelling is accurate. The Scotsmans Whitelaw praised Welch's ability to balance the various subtexts of the film while still delivering an effective narrative. The cast of the film were praised, with Dowling considering The Turn of the Screw \\"a slick production with strong performances\\", and Cooper saying that the film features \\"a great supporting cast\\". Critics particularly commended the performances of Dockery and Johnston. Dowling also picked out the performances of Lindsay and Sayer as worthy of note, while Whitelaw praised MacLiam, who was able \\"to personify pure evil with scarcely a line of dialogue\\". Segal, by contrast, felt MacLiam was badly cast, which resulted in \\"one of the story's primary dark forces [looking] more like a member of Elbow than the very essence of evil\\". Literary analysis James's novella The Turn of the Screw has been much analysed in academic literature, and, given that it has been frequently reinterpreted in the arts, discussion of many of the adaptations has found a place in the academic literature on Henry James and neo-Victorian culture. Considering the frame narrative of the film, Anna Viola Sborgi, a literary theorist, argues that the fact that Ann begins the film in a sanatorium conveys the impression that the character is mad, resulting in a loss of ambiguity. Consequently, the film is left less a horror story and more a psychological thriller. Sborgi argues that the film is explicitly made psychological through particular narrative and visual choices; for example, Miles appears at the train station in a ghost-like way through a cloud of steam. The fact that the film is a thriller, she argues, is further expressed through the use of a collage of images before the opening scene. However, the use of horrific imagery (including an open grave) in the collage \\"highlight[s] the contradiction inherent in this rendering of the novella\\": while the story is presented as psychological, the viewer is nonetheless drawn into the film as a horror story. Other than the atypical frame narrative, Sborgi considers the adaptation fairly conventional with regard to both setting and costume. For the literary theorist Thomas S. Hischak, The Turn of the Screw is a weak adaptation of the novella, with poor performances that can be \\"ascribed to the trite, anachronistic dialogue and leaden direction\\". He likens the film to In a Dark Place (2006), an earlier adaptation of the novel that focuses upon the supposed sexual aspects of the story. For Hischack, the 2009 film presents a governess who is not successful in repressing her sexuality. Ann's fantasies of her own sexual encounters with the Master, as well as her visions of the sexual encounters between Quint and Jessel, \\"are among the many obvious and clumsy aspects of this adaptation\\". Like Sborgi, Hischak sees little ambiguity in the film, calling it a \\"misguided adaptation that likes to spell things out for the viewer\\". References Further reading * Griggs, Yvonne (2016).

(His name was Ahmet. ≈ûehzade (prince) was his title). Background Ahmet was the oldest living son of Bayezid II, the 8th sultan of the Ottoman Empire and his mother was B√ºlb√ºl Hatun. In Ottoman tradition, all princes () were required to serve as provincial (sanjak) governors in Anatolia (Asiatic part of modern Turkey) as a part of their training. Ahmet was the governor of Amasya, an important Anatolian city. Although the status was not official, he was usually considered as the crown prince during the last years of his father's reign, in part because of the support of the grand vizier, Hadim Ali Pasha. Siblings Ahmet had two living brothers. Of the two, Korkut was governing in Antalya and Selim (future sultan Selim I) in Trabzon. Custom dictated that whoever first reached Istanbul after the death of the previous sultan had the right to ascend to throne (although disagreements over who had arrived first very often led to civil wars between the brothers, most prominently displayed in the Ottoman Interregnum), so the distances from the sanjaks to Istanbul more or less determined the succession and usually whoever the previous sultan favored the most as his successor. In this respect, Ahmet was the most fortunate because his sanjak was the closest to Istanbul. Although Selim's son S√ºleyman had been assigned to Bolu, a small sanjak closer to Istanbul, upon Ahmet's objection, he was relocated to Kaffa in Crimea. Selim saw this as an unofficial display of support for his older brother and asked for a sanjak in Rumeli (the European portion of the empire). Although he was initially refused on the ground that Rumeli sanjaks were not offered to princes, with the support of the vassal Crimean khan Me√±li I Giray (who was his father-in-law), he was able to receive the sanjak of Semendire (modern Smederevo in Serbia), which, although it was technically in Rumeli, was quite far from Istanbul nevertheless. Consequently, Selim chose to stay close to Istanbul instead of going to his new sanjak. His father Beyazƒ±t thought this disobedience insurrectionist; he defeated Selim's forces in battle in August 1511, and Selim escaped to Crimea.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt II, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 pp 226-231 ≈ûahkulu Rebellion While Beyazƒ±t was fighting against Selim, Ahmet was tasked with suppressing the ≈ûahkulu Rebellion in Anatolia. However, instead of fighting, Ahmet tried to win over the soldiers to his cause for winning the Ottoman throne and left the battlefield. His attitude caused unease among the soldiers; more importantly, his main supporter, Hadim Ali Pasha, lost his life during the rebellion. Capturing Konya Hearing about Selim's defeat by their father, Ahmet declared himself as the sultan of Anatolia and began fighting against one of his nephews (whose father had already been dead). He captured Konya, and although his father Beyazƒ±t asked him to return to his sanjak, he insisted on ruling in Konya. He also attempted to capture the capital; but he failed because the soldiers blocked his way, declaring their preference for a more able sultan. Selim then returned from Crimea, forced Bayezit to abdicate the throne in favor of himself, and was crowned as Selim I.Joseph von Hammer: Geschichte der osmanischen Dichtkunst (condensation Mehmet Ata) Millitet yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul pp 229-236NicolaeJorga:Geschichte des Osmanischen, (trans. by Nil√ºfer Ep√ßeli), Yeditepe yayƒ±nevi, ƒ∞stanbul, , p.263-264 Battle against Selim Ahmet continued to control a part of Anatolia in the first few months of Selim's reign. Finally, the forces of Selim and Ahmet fought a battle near Yeni≈üehir, Bursa on April 24, 1513. Ahmet's forces were defeated; he was arrested and executed shortly after.

Background and early life Meilyr FitzHenry was the son of Henry FitzHenry, an illegitimate son of King Henry I, by Nest, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, the last king of Deheubarth (South Wales). He was thus related to the noblest Norman and native families of South Wales. Robert Fitz-Stephen, Maurice FitzGerald, David FitzGerald, bishop of St. David's, and William FitzGerald of Carew were his uncles. Meilyr's cousins included Raymond le Gros, Gerald of Wales, prince Rhys ap Gruffydd, the famous Lord Rhys, as well as Henry II. In 1158 his father, Henry FitzHenry, was killed in battle during Henry II's campaign in Wales. Meilyr, Henry's oldest son, succeeded to his father's possessions of Narberth and Pebidiog, the central and north-eastern parts of the modern Pembrokeshire. In Ireland with 1169 she accompanied her uncle Robert FitzStephen on his first expedition to Ireland. He first distinguished himself in the invasion of Ossory along with his cousin Robert de Barry, older brother of Giraldus Cambrensis. In 1173 the return of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke named Strongbow to England threw Ireland into revolt. Meilyr was then in garrison at Waterford, and made a rash sortie against the Irish. He pursued them into the woods, and was surrounded. But he cut a way through them with his sword, and arrived back at Waterford with three Irish axes in his horse and two on his shield. In 1174 he returned with Raymond to Wales, but when Strongbow grew strawberries for Raymond back Meilyr came with him and received as a reward Offaly, Carbury barony, and Kildare. In October 1175 he accompanied Raymond in his expedition against Limerick, was second to swim over the River Shannon, and with his cousin David stood the attack of the Irish until the rest of the army had crossed over. He was one of the band of Geraldines who under Raymond met the new governor, William FitzAldhelm, at Waterford, and at once incurred his jealousy. Hugh de Lacy, the next Justice, took away Meilyr's Kildare estate, but gave him Leix in exchange, a marcher district. In 1182 de Lacy again became Chief Justice, built a castle on Meilyr's Leix estate at Timahoe, and gave him his niece as a wife. It seems probable that Meilyr had already been married, but he hitherto had no legitimate children. This childlessness was, in Giraldus's opinion, God's punishment to him for the want of respect to the church. Under King John In June 1200 Meilyr was in attendance with King John in Normandy, and on 28 October of that year received a grant of two cantreds in Kerry, and one in Cork. About the same time he was appointed to Ireland as Lord Chief Justice, the King reserving to himself pleas touching the crown, the mint, and the exchange. During his six years' government Meilyr had to contend against the factiousness of the Norman nobles. John de Courci, the conqueror of Ulster, was a constant source of trouble to him. The establishment of Hugh de Lacy as Earl of Ulster (29 May 1205) was a great triumph for FitzHenry. Before long, however, war broke out between Lacy and FitzHenry. Another lawless Norman noble was William de Burgh who was now engaged in the conquest of Connaught. But while De Burgh was devastating that region, FitzHenry and his assessor, Walter de Lacy, led a host into De Burgh's Munster estates (1203). De Burgh lost his estates, though on appeal to King John he ultimately recovered them all, except those in Connaught. FitzHenry had similar troubles with Richard Tirel and other nobles. Walter de Lacy, at one time his chief colleague, quarrelled with him in 1206 about the baronies of Limerick. In 1204 he was directed by the king to build a castle in Dublin to serve as a court of justice, as well as a means of defence. He was also to compel the citizens of Dublin to fortify the city itself. In 1207 FitzHenry was given the land of Offaly by King John, taken from under the lordship of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, thereby incurring hatred from the fellow barons of Ireland and head families. Those dissatisfied with King John's decision to hand over Offaly petitioned for its return, from which they received a strong rebuke from John Marshal, William Marshal's nephew, who had been named marshal of Ireland by King John. King John summoned Meiler FitzHenry, William Marshal, and other men to discuss the matter, during which FitzHenry instructed his men to attack Leinster, the land held by William Marshal who was also FitzHenry's lord. Receiving minor punishment, FitzHenry was allowed to return to Ireland with three letters that summoned to England the officers that were protecting Leinster for William Marshal. These men refused to leave their lord's land unprotected and so fought off the attacks by FitzHenry and his men. Ultimately, Meiler FitzHenry and his men were captured, their first born sons, or whatever children were available, demanded as a sign of good behavior. FitzHenry held the justiciarship until 1208, at the conclusion of Offaly being returned to William Marshal. The last writ addressed to him in that capacity is dated 19 June 1208. John Thomas GilbertViceroys of Ireland (1865) p. 59 stated that he was superseded between 1203 and 1205 by Hugh de Lacy, but many writs are addressed to him as Justice during these years. On several occasions assessors or counsellors were associated with him in his work, and he was directed to do nothing of exceptional importance without their advice (e.g. Hugh de Lacy in 1205). FitzHenry remained one of the most powerful of Irish barons, even after he ceased to be Justiciar. About 1212 his name appears immediately after that of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke in the protest of the Irish barons against the threatened deposition of John by the Pope, and the declaration of their willingness to live and die for the king. Several gifts from the king marked John's appreciation of his administration of Ireland. But it was not till August 1219 that all the expenses incurred during his viceroyalty were defrayed from the exchequer. He must by that date have been a very old man. Already in 1216 it was thought likely that he would die, or at least retire from the world into a monastery. Death There is no reference to his acts after 1219, and he died in 1220. He was buried in the chapter-house at Connell. Legacy He founded in 1202'Annals of Ireland' in Chart. St. Mary's, ii. 308; William Dugdale, Monasticon, vi. 1138. Great Connell Priory in County Kildare, which he handed over to the Austin canons of Llanthony, near Gloucester. This he endowed with large estates, with all the churches and benefices in his Irish lands, with a tenth of his household expenses, rents, and produce. Family By the niece of Hugh de Lacy, Meilyr fathered a son, also named Meilyr, who in 1206 was old enough to dispossess William de Braose of Limerick, and whose forays into Tyrconnell had already spread devastation among the Irish. FitzHenry's older brother, Robert Fitzhenry, had died around 1180.

It caters to nearly 6,500 people distributed in 32 Varados (Konkani: Wards). Although the church was not yet built then, the French missionary, Fr. Jean-Antoine Dubois served as the first parish priest of the Cordel parish from 1873, until his death on 12 December 1877. His service to the parishioners of Cordel gave him the nickname \\"Fraadh Saibh of Cordel\\". The cross discreetly worshipped in the Cordel forest by the Catholics who escaped the Seringapatam captivity was ceremoniously brought by Fr. Dubois to the Cordel plateau, where the Cordel Church now stands. When his vision to raise a grand church at Milagres failed to fructify, he shifted his base to Cordel. He met the expenses of this work through 30,000 Francs given to him by his family and another 30,000 francs given by his godfather--which otherwise would have been utilized for Milagres. He laid the foundation stone for the church on 14 September 1873. The church was eventually opened in 1904. Citations References *.

He held the position Marshal of Ireland, commander of the Royal Irish Army during the reign of Charles II. A supporter of the Glorious Revolution, he fought on the Williamite side during the War of the Two Kings. Early life Forbes was the eldest son of Sir Arthur Forbes of Corse Castle and Castle Forbes in Aberdeenshire; who went to Ireland in 1620 with the Master of Forbes's regiment, of which he was lieutenant-colonel, and was granted large estates in Leitrim and Longford by King James I. His mother was Jane, daughter of Sir Robert Lauder of the Isle of Bass, and widow of Sir Alexander Hamilton of Killeshandra, co. Cavan. His father was killed in a duel in 1632, and he was brought up by his mother. English Civil War During the rebellion of 1641 Jane Forbes was besieged in Castle Forbes, the family seat, for nine months, and Forbes raised men for her relief, though only eighteen years old. He is next heard of in Scotland, serving under James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose in the cause of King Charles I. On the defeat of Montrose in 1645, Forbes was taken prisoner, and for two years he was confined in Edinburgh Castle. On his release he made efforts to restore the Stuarts, and then returned to Ireland in 1655. Under Charles II In 1660 he was sent to Charles at Breda to assure him that if he would only go over to Ireland the whole kingdom would declare for him. At the Restoration he was appointed a commissioner of the court of claims in Ireland, and received additional grants of land in Westmeath. In 1661 he entered the Irish House of Commons as member for County Tyrone. In 1663 he did service to the king in the north of Ireland by nipping in the bud efforts there in support of Thomas Blood's plot. Honours then came his way. In 1670 he was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland, and appointed marshal and commander-in-chief of the army. In 1671 he was one of the Lord Justices (Ireland); on several subsequent occasions he held the post. In 1672 he was helped the Presbyterian Church of Ireland, of which he was a member, by procuring for it the first grant of regium donum, which the church continued to enjoy until the passing of the Irish Church Act in 1869, with the exception of a short interval. James Kirkpatrick, in his Essay Upon the Loyalty of Presbyterians (1713), gave an account of Forbes's lobbying. In 1675 he was created Baron Clanehugh and Viscount Granard. In 1684 he raised the 18th Regiment of Foot, and was made colonel thereof, and in the same year was advanced to the dignity of Earl of Granard. Under James II James II endeavoured to make use of Granard; but he was not pliable, and was removed from the command of the army, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell being put in his place. When James's Dublin parliament passed the acts of repeal and attainder, he remonstrated with the king. Finding his arguments vain, he went to the House of Lords, entered his protest against the measures, and retired to Castle Forbes. Here he was unsuccessfully besieged by Irish forces. Williamite War When William III went over to Ireland, Granard was placed by the king in command of a force of five thousand men for the reduction of Sligo, the surrender of which he secured. This was his last public service. Death His closing years were spent quietly at Castle Forbes, where he died in 1696. Family He married Catherine, daughter of Sir Robert Newcomen of Mosstown, co. Longford, and widow of Sir Alexander Stewart, ancestor of the Mountjoy family, by whom he had five sons and one daughter. He was succeeded by his eldest son Arthur, 2nd Earl of Granard. His second son Robert was killed at the Siege of Buda (1686). His daughter, Lady Catherine, married Arthur Chichester, 3rd Earl of Donegall.

Titled Scottish landowning families often rented apartments in Edinburgh so their girls could receive further education, be launched on Edinburgh Society, and attend balls. Lady Maxwell moved there, separate from her husband's household, in 1760 with her three daughters: Catherine, 13; Jane, 11; and Eglantine, 9, the future Lady Wallace of Craigie. Sir William continued to live with his sons at Monreith. Jane's family lived in humble circumstances in Edinburgh, where the children played in the streets. This was where Jane had an accident as a 14-year-old. She somehow got a finger of her right hand jammed in the wheel of a cart which moved away and tore off the finger. There is at Monreith House a letter written by her after the accident, left-handed, explaining how it happened. After this she wore gloves whenever possible, in which a wooden finger replaced the one missing. One of these wooden fingers is still at Monreith House. In later life she used to explain the loss of the finger by saying it was a coaching accident. When Jane reached 16 she was so strikingly beautiful that a song was written about her: \\"Bonnie Jennie of Monreith, the Flower of Galloway\\". That was also when she fell in love for the first and probably only time. The object of her affections was a young officer who was probably a Fraser, a relative of Lord Lovat. Soon after they met, he left with his regiment, probably to go to America, and word later reached her that he had died. Marriage Jane‚Äôs husband, Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, portrayed by Pompeo Batoni (1764) On 18 October 1767Volume 5. The Register of Marriages. (Marriage) Collection: Midlothian: Edinburgh - Register of Marriages, 1751-1800 Jane married the 24-year-old Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon. The young Duke lived in the Gordon townhouse almost opposite the Maxwells, and he had inherited a considerable fortune and the title at the age of nine. It was while they were on honeymoon at the Fordyce‚Äôs country seat, Ayton in Berwickshire, that she received a note from her former love, the young Fraser, very much alive, asking her to marry him. She is said to have read the note and fainted. However, she kept in touch with the young Fraser. For the next 20 years, the Duke and Duchess lived at Gordon Castle in Morayshire which Jane‚Äôs husband enlarged to be one of the largest homes in Scotland‚Äîwith a facade 600 feet long and an 84 foot high central tower. Part of the town of Fochabers had to be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere to make room for the extensions. However, years later most of the enlargements were dismantled again. Jane, Duchess of Gordon, with her son George Gordon, Marquess of Huntly, the future 5th Duke of Gordon, by George Romney, 1778 At Gordon Castle, Jane organised parties, planted trees, and took a keen interest in farming. She was a great enthusiast for local dancing and fiddle and pipe music. She is credited with establishing the Strathspey as a dance form. The couple had seven children. Her first son, George, Marquess of Huntly, the later George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon was born in 1770. The Duke also had an illegitimate son at about the same time, also called George, by a Mrs. Christie. Jane used to refer to ‚Äúmy George and the Duke‚Äôs George‚Äù. Patronage of Robert Burns Jane entertained on an increasingly lavish scale, with as many as 100 sitting down to dinner and guests staying for three months in the Castle. And in the 1780s, the Duchess started entertaining in Edinburgh, quickly becoming the leading hostess. Jane was the sole arbitress of fashion in Edinburgh. Horace Walpole called her the ‚ÄúEmpress of fashion‚Äù. She regularly gave soir√©e evenings where up and coming artists were asked to entertain. It was in her drawing room that Robert Burns first read his poetry to Edinburgh society, and she became his chief sponsor, purchasing all his early published works. Relocation to London Cap badge of the Gordon Highlanders In 1787 the Duke and the Duchess of Gordon moved to London. They first rented a house on Downing Street from Lord Sheffield, then one in Pall Mall from the Marquess of Buckingham, and finally one in St. James's Square. And Jane continued her party-giving habit, but with a distinctly Scottish flavour. She made everyone dance Scottish dances. King George III adored her, and she supported the King, so she was allowed to promote her Scottish heritage more than others would have dared. She gave a ball at which she and the Duchess of York dressed in tartan when it was officially banned, and she arranged for the King to inspect troops dressed in tartan in Hyde Park. It was in the Pall Mall house that she held her greatest parties. Close to Parliament in Westminster, she kept open house for the Tories. Pitt, the Prime Minister, and Dundas, the Lord Advocate, were frequent visitors. And it was during this time that she arranged a truce between the King and his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, whose had run up enormous debts. She arranged for his debts to be met, and this enabled the construction of the Royal Pavilion at Brighton to be continued. =Raising of the Gordon Highlanders= In 1793, the French Revolutionary Government declared war on Great Britain. At that time the British army was short of recruits, since the military service was not very popular among the young men. As a consequence the Government asked Jane‚Äôs husband, the Duke of Gordon, to raise another regiment. The outcome of this was a bet between Jane and the Prince of Wales, the future King George IV. Jane bet with the Prince that she could raise more men than he, meaning the Government. Although 45 by then, she was still extremely attractive. Her recruiting technique was, to say the least, unusual. She wore a military uniform and a large black feathered hat (highland bonnet), touring Scotland to organise reels. Anyone who joined the reel joined the army and received the King‚Äôs shilling, the recruiting payment, from between the Duchess‚Äô lips by kissing her. This was how the Gordon Highlanders were founded. Her total was 940 men. On 24 June 1794, the newly embodied regiment paraded for the first time at Aberdeen. The regiment existed until 1994.\\"Duchess of Gordon‚Äôs Monument\\". The Geograph Britain and Ireland Project. Kinrara House In 1799, Jane became depressed and ill. Her eldest son, George, the later George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon, had gone off to the wars, and she wrote in a letter to a friend: ‚ÄúOh where and oh where has my highland laddie gone?‚Äù Her second son, Alexander (1785‚Äì1808), died at 23, and her husband had moved his mistress, Jane Christie, into Gordon Castle and built a small house on the Spey, called Kinrara, for his estranged wife. Jane lived there for the next six years, continuing her entertaining and partying. Daughters' marriages Lady Rachel Evelyn Russell (1826‚Äì1898), a granddaughter of Jane, portrayed by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (1835). It was said that Rachel was the daughter of Jane's daughter Georgiana and Edwin Henry Landseer. Having enjoyed life as a Duchess, Jane was determined to get her daughters well married, and she set out securing suitable husbands for them. In 1802, after the Peace of Amiens, she took her youngest daughter, Georgiana (1781‚Äì1853), to Paris with a view to marrying her to the son of the Empress Jos√©phine, Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. This would not have been popular so soon after hostilities, but nothing came of it. A short time later, Georgiana was reputed to be friendly, if not engaged, to Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, but he died before they could marry. Jane then arranged a meeting with the Duke‚Äôs younger brother John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford who had inherited the title and recently been widowed with several children. All went as planned, and he soon married his late brother‚Äôs fianc√©e on 23 June 1803 in London. Georgiana had ten children by the Duke, and she followed in her mother‚Äôs partying footsteps, entertaining frequently in her Bedford home, Woburn Abbey. The Duchess of Bedford was a great patroness of the arts, and had a long-standing relationship with the painter Sir Edwin Henry Landseer. Jane then turned to finding a husband for Charlotte (1768‚Äì1842), the eldest daughter. She plotted to have her marry William Pitt, the Prime Minister, but her plan failed when Pitt‚Äôs close friend, Lord Henry Dundas, took an interest in Charlotte. Neither potential husband worked out, and Charlotte later married on 9 September 1789 at Gordon Castle Colonel Charles Lennox, the future 4th Duke of Richmond. General Cornwallis had returned to England from his disastrous command of the British troops during the American Revolution to be, rather surprisingly, treated as a hero and created a Marquess. Having fought with Jane‚Äôs brother at Plessey in India as well as in the American war, he would have been a friend of Jane‚Äôs. So his eldest son, Lord Brome, was therefore considered suitable for Louisa (1776‚Äì1850), the fourth daughter. Cornwallis refused to approve the marriage, however, citing madness in the Gordon family. The duchess allayed his fears by swearing that there was ‚Äúnot one drop of Gordon blood‚Äù in this particular daughter. The marriage then proceeded on 17 April 1795 in London. History does not relate who Louisa‚Äôs natural father was, but it is thought to have been Captain Fraser, her early love from Edinburgh. Susan (1774‚Äì1828), the third daughter, was married on 7 October 1793 in Edinburgh to William Montagu, 5th Duke of Manchester, and Madeleine (1772‚Äì1847), the second daughter, married firstly on 2 April 1789 in London to Sir Robert Sinclair, 7th Baronet. On 25 November 1805 she married secondly at Kimbolton Castle to Charles Fysche Palmer. End of her marriage Jane‚Äôs own marriage had been more or less an arrangement from the beginning. The return from the dead of her first love during the honeymoon was an inauspicious start. The Duke having an illegitimate son by Jane Christie at the same time as his heir was born was an unfortunate sequence, to be followed by the birth of his illegitimate daughter a few years later. The Duke openly kept his mistress at Gordon Castle while the Duchess seems to have preferred assignations with her lover on the windswept moors. By 1805, the marriage was officially over, and the couple reached a financial agreement whereby the Duchess would be given a new house, capital payments, and generous annual payments. The Duke was by then in financial difficulties, however; he acknowledged his liability to the Duchess, but he did not pay all the monies legally due her. Jane was reduced to living in hotels, and she became increasingly eccentric. She was involved in an acrimonious dispute with her estranged husband over money, and she died in 1812 at Poultney‚Äôs Hotel, Piccadilly, London, surrounded by her four daughters and surviving son. Her body was taken north to be buried at the old Celtic Chapel by the banks of the Spey at Kinrara. There her husband carried out her final wish and erected a monument to her on which were recorded the marriages of her children. Legacy Robert Burns, portrayed (detail) by Alexander Nasmyth (1787). Jane was one of Robert Burns's most important patronesses. He thanked her with a poem. Jane, Duchess of Gordon, was painted by most of the leading English portrait painters like George Romney, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir Henry Raeburn and Daniel Gardner, but she was known for her intelligence, infectious laugh, and sense of humour as well as her looks. She appears to have had an enormous amount of energy which she directed towards helping what she considered good causes. She left her mark on history by what she did to get Scotland and Scottish culture accepted by the new Kings of Great Britain with German roots. And she is remembered in the lines of Robert Burns, of whose poetry she was an important early patroness: She kiltit up her kirtle weel To show her bonie cutes sae sma‚Äô, And walloped about the reel, The lightest louper o‚Äô them a‚Äô! While some, like slav‚Äôring, doited stots Stoit‚Äôring out thro‚Äô the midden dub, Fankit their heels amang their coats And gart the floor their backsides rub; Gordon, the great, the gay, the gallant, Skip‚Äôt like a maukin owre a dyke: Deil tak me, since I was a callant, Gif e-er my een beheld the like!

(a Latin treatise circulated in France c. 1636) to calculate maxima and minima of functions, tangents to curves, area, center of mass, least action, and other problems in calculus. According to Andr√© Weil, Fermat \\"introduces the technical term adaequalitas, adaequare, etc., which he says he has borrowed from Diophantus. As Diophantus V.11 shows, it means an approximate equality, and this is indeed how Fermat explains the word in one of his later writings.\\" (Weil 1973).See also Diophantus coined the word œÄŒ±œÅŒπœÉœåœÑŒ∑œÇ (parisotƒìs) to refer to an approximate equality. Claude Gaspard Bachet de M√©ziriac translated Diophantus's Greek word into Latin as adaequalitas. Paul Tannery's French translation of Fermat‚Äôs Latin treatises on maxima and minima used the words ad√©quation and ad√©galer.  Fermat's method  Fermat used adequality first to find maxima of functions, and then adapted it to find tangent lines to curves. To find the maximum of a term p(x), Fermat equated (or more precisely adequated) p(x) and p(x+e) and after doing algebra he could cancel out a factor of e, and then discard any remaining terms involving e. To illustrate the method by Fermat's own example, consider the problem of finding the maximum of p(x)=bx-x^2 (In Fermat's words, it is to divide a line of length b at a point x, such that the product of the two resulting parts be a maximum.) Fermat adequated bx-x^2 with b(x+e)-(x+e)^2=bx-x^2+be-2ex-e^2. That is (using the notation \\\\backsim to denote adequality, introduced by Paul Tannery): :bx-x^2\\\\backsim bx-x^2+be-2ex-e^2. Canceling terms and dividing by e Fermat arrived at :b\\\\backsim 2x+e. Removing the terms that contained e Fermat arrived at the desired result that the maximum occurred when x=b/2. Fermat also used his principle to give a mathematical derivation of Snell's laws of refraction directly from the principle that light takes the quickest path. Descartes' criticism Fermat's method was highly criticized by his contemporaries, particularly Descartes. Victor Katz suggests this is because Descartes had independently discovered the same new mathematics, known as his method of normals, and Descartes was quite proud of his discovery. Katz also notes that while Fermat's methods were closer to the future developments in calculus, Descartes' methods had a more immediate impact on the development. Scholarly controversy Both Newton and Leibniz referred to Fermat's work as an antecedent of infinitesimal calculus. Nevertheless, there is disagreement amongst modern scholars about the exact meaning of Fermat's adequality. Fermat's adequality was analyzed in a number of scholarly studies. In 1896, Paul Tannery published a French translation of Fermat‚Äôs Latin treatises on maxima and minima (Fermat, ≈íuvres, Vol. III, pp. 121‚Äì156). Tannery translated Fermat's term as ‚Äúad√©galer‚Äù and adopted Fermat‚Äôs ‚Äúad√©quation‚Äù. Tannery also introduced the symbol \\\\backsim for adequality in mathematical formulas.

On page 36, Barner writes: \\"Why did Fermat continually repeat his inconsistent procedure for all his examples for the method of tangents? Why did he never mention the secant, with which he in fact operated? I do not know.\\" Katz, Schaps, Shnider (2013) argue that Fermat's application of the technique to transcendental curves such as the cycloid shows that Fermat's technique of adequality goes beyond a purely algebraic algorithm, and that, contrary to Breger's interpretation, the technical terms parisotes as used by Diophantus and adaequalitas as used by Fermat both mean \\"approximate equality\\". They develop a formalisation of Fermat's technique of adequality in modern mathematics as the standard part function which rounds off a finite hyperreal number to its nearest real number.

While Petar Segrt as coach, Georgia U21 make one of the biggest success in Georgian National team football history with a 2:0 victory against Russia U21 in 2007 European U21 Cup qualification. After Klaus Toppm√∂ller left the Georgia A-national team on 1 April 2008, Petar Segrt was appointed as first Technical Director in history of Georgian Football Federation. He was also leading Georgia A-national team as head coach in friendly games against Estonia and Portugal in May 2008, before Georgian Football Federation appointed H√©ctor C√∫per as head coach on August 1, 2008. In addition to his coaching skills, Segrt gained large popularity in Georgia during the Georgia-Russia war conflict in 2008, after his famous speech at Rustaveli square in Tbilisi, where he promised to the thousands of Georgian people gathered, that he would not leave their country despite the war. After his great work in Georgia, in December 2008 Germany's leading sports magazine Kicker announced that German Football Association choose Petar Segrt as one of the candidates for taking over Germany U21. In the end of 2010 Konsorsium Liga Premier Indonesia invited Petar Segrt to be a part and help them with his coaching and managing experience to build a new club in Indonesian professional football based in Bali, so Segrt approached to Bali Devata which competed in Liga Primer Indonesia. After he finished his job with Bali Devata the same consortium offered him a new job as head coach of former Indonesian champion PSM Makassar. =PSM Makassar= Since October 2011 Petar Segrt was appointed as head coach of PSM Makassar. Very traditional club which last years had many problems and not even one national team player anymore. After only one season in Indonesian Premier League Segrt developed 10 new Indonesian national players, six players were invited for Indonesia A-national team and four players were invited for Indonesia U-23 national team. After success Segrt achieved that season, in July 2012 PSM Makassar club boards offered him 5 years contract extension, which is very uncommon for Indonesian clubs. Petar Segrt also have unbeaten home record in Indonesian Premier League, which is the first time for PSM Makassar in the club's 97 years history, although he had youngest team in the Indonesian Premier League as average age of the players was 22. In December 2012, Petar Segrt lead the team winning the Walikota Cup in Ternate. That was the first trophy for PSM Makassar after almost 12 years. Although he had contract until 2017, after his team winning game in Jun 2013 Petar Segrt decided to leave PSM Makassar for private reasons. The club's supporters showed their disappointment by decision of their favorite coach, but together with president and club's management they invited Segrt to attend the next home game in July 2013. They filled the stadium and prepared official goodbye in front of the game, which is very unusual for Indonesian supporters. =Zvijezda Gradaƒçac= After leaving PSM Makassar, Petar was a strong candidate to coach Indonesia national football team. In September 2014, Petar Segrt accepted the offer from Bosnian Premier League club Zvijezda Gradaƒçac. Although Petar Segrt brought Zvijezda in the middle of the ranking, in April 2015 the club got a new management and they decided to appoint a new coach. That ended up being a poor decision as the club got relegated from the Premier League shortly after Segrt left. =Afghanistan national team= In November 2015, Afghanistan Football Federation announced that they appointed Petar Segrt as the new head coach.

The oldest, Roman walls were developed in two stages, the first in the Republican and the second in the Imperial era. The second wall system was realized in the Middle Ages (12th Century), after the destruction of the city by Frederick I Barbarossa. Finally, the latest wall system was built by the Spanish rulers (16th Century). While very little remains of these walls, their structure is clearly reflected in the urbanistic layout of the city. In particular, modern Milan has two roughly circular rings of streets, namely the \\"Cerchia dei Navigli\\" and the \\"Cerchia dei Bastioni\\", which essentially correspond to the Medieval and Spanish walls, respectively. Note that a third ring of roads just beyond the Inner Ring Road (circonvallazione interna / \\"Cerchia dei Bastioni\\"), called the External Ring Road (circonvallazione esterna), does not owe itself to any old city walls; but was part of the 1884 Beruto Plan for the city of Milan, created and named after a municipal engineer and public servant to the local city government. Roman walls Map of the Roman walls of Milan. The Republican walls are shown in red, the Imperial (Maximian) walls in blue =Republican walls= The oldest wall system was built when Milan (the Mediolanum) became a Roman municipium, in 49 BC. It was essentially square, each side about 700 m long. The walls had 6 main gates, which are usually referred to as \\"Porta Romana\\" (in Piazza Missori), \\"Porta Ticinese\\" (at Carrobbio), \\"Porta Vercellina\\" (where Santa Maria alla Porta church stands, \\"Porta Orientale\\" (or Porta Argentea, in via San Paolo), \\"Porta Jovia\\" (in via San Giovanni sul Muro), and \\"Porta Cumana\\" (at the end of Via Broletto, between Via Cusani and Via del Lauro). Note that some of these names (for example, \\"Porta Romana\\" and \\"Porta Ticinese\\" are also used to refer to gates of later wall systems located in the same area. =Maximian walls= The Maximian tower in the courtyard of the Archaeological Museum of Milan In the Imperial era, while Mediolanum was capital of the Western Roman Empire, Emperor Maximian enlarged the city walls; to the east, this was intended to include the Hercules' thermae (located in the surroundings of what are now Piazza San Babila, Corso Europa and Piazza Fontana); to the west, the new walls enclosed the arena. Overall, the new wall systems exceeded 100 hectares. Two gates where added, later referred to as \\"Porta Nuova\\" (in what is now the corner between via Manzoni and via Montenapoleone) and \\"Porta Tonsa\\" (in the area now known as \\"Verziere\\"). =Remnants= A few sections of Milan's Roman walls are still in place, among which: * in the northern part of Carrobbio, partially englobed in the modern buildings, a part of the 1st Century tower of Porta Ticinese; * in the basement of some buildings of San Vito, a trait of the Republican walls; * in the garden of a building in Via Medici, a Maximian tower and a short trait of walls; * in the courtyard of the Archaeological Museum of Corso Magenta, a 24-side polygonal Maximian tower; * in the basement of some building of Via Montenapoleone, some traits of Maximian walls * in the cloister of the Monastery of San Vittore, now Leonardo da Vinci Museum of Science and Technology, the remnants of an octagonal building and two towers. Medieval walls \\"Porta Ticinese\\", one of the remaining gates from the medieval walls of Milan \\"Pusterla di Sant'Ambrogio\\", one of the remaining medieval posterns The medieval walls of Milan were built in the 12th Century, mostly as a defense against Frederick I Barbarossa, who repeatedly raided Lombardy. The perimeter of the medieval walls essentially correspond to what is now known as the \\"Cerchia dei Navigli\\" (\\"Navigli Ring\\"), a ring of streets that enclose the historic centre of the city. The construction of the medieval defensive structure of Milan started in 1156. In the beginning, a deep moat was realized, filled up with water drawn from the Seveso and Nirone rivers. Wooden walls were added as a supplementary defensive measure, and the remnants of the Roman walls were probably exploited as well. Despite this first defensive installment, Frederick I Barbarossa razed Milan to the ground in 1162. After that, reconstruction immediately started, this time with stone walls. The final wall system was almost circular (in poet Bonvesin de la Riva's words: \\"of admirable roundness\\"),Bonvesin de la Riva, De Magnilibus Mediolani, Milan 1288 - Pontiggia ed. Bompiani 1974. with seven main gates (Porta Ticinese, Porta Vercellina, Porta Giovia, Porta Comasina, Porta Romana, Porta Nuova and Porta Orientale) and about ten \\"pusterle\\" or posterns (including Pusterla dei Fabbri, Pusterla di Sant'Ambrogio, Pusterla delle Azze, Pusterla di San Marco, Pusterla Monforte, Pusterla Tosa, Pusterla di Sant'Eufemia, Pusterla della Chiusa). Most of the medieval walls were demolished between the 16th and 19th Century. The moats remained and were used as canals. =Remnants= Traits of Milan's medieval walls that still exist today include: * at the end of Via Manzoni, the old 12th Century Porta Nuova; * Porta Ticinese, also one of the main gates of the medieval walls; * remnants of the medieval Porta Romana, in the basement of two buildings at the crossroad between Corso di Porta Romana and Via Sforza; * about 20 meters of medieval walls have been preserved in Via San Damiano; * in the building at Corso di Porta Venezia, 21, there is a fragment of a bas-relief that used to be part of Porta Orientale. The pusterla di Sant'Ambrogio, located by the eponymous church, is a 1939 reconstruction of the original Pusterla di Sant'Ambrogio. Spanish walls Milan in 1573 The so-called \\"Mura Spagnole\\" (Spanish Walls) of Milan were built between 1546 and 1560 in obedience to the will of Ferrante Gonzaga, city governor during the Spanish rule of Milan. The new wall system had an overall perimeter of about 11 km, much larger than that of the medieval walls; several traits of the walls were reinforced by moats obtained by the numerous canals surrounding the city. The perimeter of the Spanish walls essentially corresponds to what is now known as the \\"Cerchia dei Bastioni\\" (\\"Bastion Ring\\"). The walls remained well into the 19th Century, but they lost their military purpose in the mid 18th Century, being adapted as a sort of panoramic promenade by governor Gian Luca Pallavicini. Stendhal has described this promenade in his diary Rome, Naples et Florence; at the time, a passer-by would be able to see the Duomo from anywhere on the walls. From the northern part of the walls, one would be able to see both the Duomo (if looking south) and the Alps (if looking north). The Spanish walls comprised 11 gates: Porta Romana, Porta Tosa (now Porta Vittoria), Porta Orientale (renamed Porta Venezia in 1860), Porta Nuova, Porta Comasina (renamed Porta Garibaldi in 1860), Porta Tenaglia, Porta Sempione, Porta Vercellina, Porta Ticinese, Porta Lodovica, and Porta Vigentina. Spanish walls in Porta Romana When Milan was annexed to the Napoleonic Empire, governor Francesco Melzi d'Eril ordered the demolition of the Spanish walls and the replaced the original gates. At the time, the gates were to serve as customs duty stations, and their architecture was supposed to reflect the grandeur of the Napoleonic Empire as well as the role of Milan as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. As a consequence, many of Milan's modern \\"gates\\" are located where the Spanish gates used to be, but only date back to the 19th Century. =Remnants= The best preserved parts of the Spanish walls are found in the surroundings of Porta Romana, for example in Piazza Medaglie d'Oro, between Piazza Medaglie d'Oro and Piazza XXIV Maggio, and in Viale Vittorio Veneto. In Viale Monte Nero there are two small gardens obtained from the old walls.

The judgement of William Macready was that \\"her merits were confined to melodrama.\\"Macready, Reminiscences, i. 125 Early life Egerton was the daughter of Peter Fisher, rector of Little Torrington, Devon. After her father died in 1803 she took to the stage, appearing at the Bath theatre on 3 December 1803 as Emma in John Till Allingham's play The Marriage Promise. Here she remained for six or seven years, playing as a rule secondary characters. Her last benefit at Bath took place on 21 March 1809, when she played Gunilda in William Dimond's Hero of the North and Emmeline in John Hawkesworth's Edgar and Emmeline. She probably married Daniel Egerton soon afterwards. He was playing leading business in Bath. Her first recorded appearance as Mrs. Egerton was at Birmingham in 1810. On 25 February 1811, as Mrs. Egerton from Birmingham, she played Juliet at Covent Garden without much success. Marcia in Cato, Luciana in Comedy of Errors, and Emilia in Othello followed during the same season. Success in melodrama James Thomson, after Samuel De Wilde. From Daniel Terry's musical stage adaptation of Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering. Sarah Egerton had stiff opposition in Sarah Siddons and subsequently Eliza O'Neill, and it was not until she took to melodrama that her position became assured. In The Miller and his Men by Isaac Pocock she was (21 October 1813) the original Ravina. She relapsed into obscurity, from which, thanks to adaptations from the Waverley Novels, she then returned. Guy Mannering, or the Gipsy's Prophecy, by Daniel Terry, was produced at Covent Garden on 12 March 1816. John Emery was originally cast for Meg Merrilies, but refused to take the part. The management turned almost in despair to Egerton, whose success proved to be conspicuous. Helen Macgregor in Pocock's Rob Roy Macgregor, or Auld Lang Syne, 12 March 1818, followed. Her services having been dispensed with at Covent Garden, she played (13 January 1819), at the Surrey Theatre, Madge Wildfire in Thomas Dibdin's The Heart of Midlothian, or the Lily of St. Leonard's, and subsequently Young Norval in John Home's Douglas, played as a melodrama. In 1819‚Äì1820 she appeared at Drury Lane, then under R. W. Elliston's management, as Meg Merrilies, playing during this and the following seasons in tragedy and melodrama, and even in comedy. She was the Queen to Edmund Kean's Hamlet, and appeared as Clementina Allspice in Thomas Morton's The Way to Get Married, Volumnia in Coriolanus, Jane de Monfort in the alteration of Joanna Baillie's De Monfort, brought forward for Kean 27 November 1821, Alicia in Nicholas Rowe's Jane Shore, and many other characters. When in 1821 her husband took on Sadler's Wells, she appeared with conspicuous success as Joan of Arc in Edward Fitzball's drama of that name. Subsequently she played in melodrama at the Olympic Theatre, also under her husband's management. Later life Soon after Daniel Egerton's death in 1835 she retired from the stage, accepting a pension from the Covent Garden Fund. She died at Chelsea on 3 August 1847, and was buried on 7 August in Chelsea churchyard.

The train with these supplies followed that of > headquarters until we reached Taneytown.

The effect of > this order was to deprive the department almost wholly of the means for > taking care of the wounded until the result of the engagement of the 2d and > 3d was fully known.... In most of the corps the wagons exclusively used for > medicines moved with the ambulances, so that the medical officers had a > sufficient supply of dressings, chloroform, and such articles until the > supplies came up, but the tents and other appliances, which are as > necessary, were not available until July 5.

The > reports of Dr. Brinton and Dr. [John H.] Taylor show that I ordered more > supplies than were used up to the 18th of July, when the hospitals were > taken from under my control. Surgeon Taylor, medical inspector of this army, > who was ordered on July 29 to Gettysburg, to examine into the state of > affairs there, reports to me that he made \\"the question of supplies a > subject of special inquiry among the medical officers who had remained with > the wounded during and for a month subsequent to the battle.

Surgeon [John] > McNulty, medical director of that corps, reports that \\"it is with extreme > satisfaction that I can assure you that it enabled me to remove the wounded > from the field, shelter, feed them, and dress their wounds within six hours > after the battle ended, and to have every capital operation performed within > twenty-four hours after the injury was received.

Thirteen of them were wounded, one of whom (Asst. Surg. W. S. > Moore, Sixty-first Ohio Volunteers, Eleventh Corps) died on July 6 from the > effects of his wounds, received on the 3d. The idea, very prevalent, that > medical officers are not exposed to fire, is thus shown to be wholly > erroneous. The greater portion of the surgical labor was performed before > the army left.

One hundred and six medical officers were left behind when the > army left; no more could be left, as it was expected that another battle > would within three or four days take place, and in all probability as many > wounded thrown upon our hands as at the battle of the 2d and 3d, which had > just occurred. No reliance can be placed on surgeons from civil life during > or after a battle.

Representative Women of New England, pp. 301‚Äì303. Boston, Massachusetts: New England Historical Publishing Company, 1904. Tillie Pierce, a teenager at the time of the battle, also reportedly nursed wounded men at Camp Letterman. An eyewitness to troop movements and various stages of the battle, she was the daughter of a Gettysburg butcher, and later went on to write, At Gettysburg, or What A Girl Saw and Heard of the Battle: A True Narrative.\\"Alleman, Mrs. Tillie (Pierce).

Rebecca Lane Pennypacker Price was one of the women who provided comfort to wounded and dying soldiers after the Battle of Gettysburg. One of those who provided other services was Rebecca Lane Pennypacker Price who, as a member of the Phoenixville Union Relief Society, had been involved in relief efforts since the beginning of the war, recruiting women to sew and knit clothing items for Union troops, organizing financial and other types of donation drives, and personally delivering supplies to troops thanks to the help of a travel pass that was issued to her by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin. She then progressed on to provide nursing care at various Union hospitals, where she became acquainted with, and respected by, several military physicians. Initially partnering with members of her relief society and the Christian Commission to collect and transport supplies to Gettysburg following the battle, she quickly became a helper to the Union's ambulance corps, providing comfort to men who were awaiting transport from battle sites, helping to distract those awaiting amputation and other surgical procedures, and writing letters on behalf of dying soldiers who wanted to transmit their final thoughts and to their families. As physicians she knew from previous battlefield assignments came to realize that she was on site at Letterman, she increasingly became involved with caring for hopeless medical cases, rendering end-of-life care to men from both sides of the conflict who were too grievously wounded to survive their injuries.Otto, Frank. \\"Phoenixville woman traveled to Gettysburg to tend to wounded.\\" Pottsville, Pennsylvania: The Mercury, June 3, 2013.

He played for Watford, initially as an inside forward, and latterly as a half back and full back. Early and personal life Gregory was born in Pinner in 1886. The second of six sons, Gregory was named after his father, who was a tenant farmer at Pinner Hill Farm, and later the licensee of Oddfellows pub in Pinner. He was educated at Pinner National School, and played his first game of men's football aged 11, for Pinner Football Club's reserves. In his early adult years, his primary sporting focus was cricket; he played as a batsman for Pinner CC and Eastcote CC, before coaching the Benskins Brewery cricket team. Gregory joined Watford as an amateur in 1911, turning professional later the same year. He was subsequently joined by three of his brothers: Val, Allan and Owen. At one stage, all four of them were contracted to the club simultaneously, although only Fred and Val went on to play for the first-team. Watford Gregory made his Watford debut on 30 September 1911, playing at inside forward as Watford won 2‚Äì0 against West Ham United at Cassio Road. He went on to play every game in October and November, and was still in the team when Val made his debut on 25 December, in a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Luton Town. Fred continued to play on a regular basis from then on, and finished his first season with 25 appearances and 8 goals in all competitions, as the club finished 9th. Over the following two seasons he continued to play regularly, but the team dropped 14th in the 1912‚Äì13 season, and narrowly avoided relegation in 1913‚Äì14 with an 18th-placed finish. Despite Britain's participation in the First World War, the 1914‚Äì15 season continued as scheduled. Gregory played in all 38 league matches, and his goal in the penultimate game secured a 3‚Äì2 win at Gillingham, ensuring that Watford finished the season as Southern League champions. As a result of the war, peacetime competitions were suspended from 1915 until 1919. Gregory served in the Royal Garrison Artillery, but also made 53 appearances for Watford in wartime fixtures. On the resumption of peacetime football in 1919‚Äì20, Gregory played 34 league games. His last appearance alongside Val came on 5 April 1920, in a 2‚Äì1 win against Luton; at the end of the season Val left the club to join Wolverhampton Wanderers, for a then-record Watford fee of ¬£1,500. Watford came close to defending their title, but eventually missed out to Portsmouth on the final day of the season on goal average. Watford, along with all other Southern League First Division clubs, joined the newly formed Football League Third Division in 1920. Gregory captained the team in their first ever Football League game, a 2‚Äì1 away win against Queens Park Rangers on 28 August. The team finished the season in 6th position, with Gregory making 21 league appearances. Over the next five seasons, Gregory continued to play frequently, making at least 20 appearances per season as a left back, and regularly attracting praise from journalists covering Watford's opposition. He scored in his final home game for Watford, in a 3‚Äì2 win over Swindon Town. However, his professional career ended in a 6‚Äì1 defeat at Exeter City, on 1 May 1926. Later life and final years Although he ultimately did not make another first-team appearance, Gregory remained at Watford for a further two seasons, and made several appearances for the reserves. He became landlord of The Victory pub in Pinner in 1926, a role that he continued for the remainder of his life. In his later years he suffered from tuberculosis, and he spent the final four months of his life at a sanatorium in Harefield. Gregory died on 24 May 1937, aged 50.

The theme and moral of the legend are similar to those of the European folktale \\"Cinderella\\". Summary Once upon a time, seven orphan sisters lived together in a village; the youngest sibling was the only stepdaughter from previous marriage of their late parents. The youngest one was opposite in character and personality to her sisters. She was a diligent, kind, honest and humble girl who did all the housework, such as laundry, cooking and cleaning. Her older sisters were lazy, rude, mean, glamorous, proud and envious girls who were always ordering their youngest sister around. One day, the youngest sister loses some of her older sisters' clothes while doing the daily laundry on the river. The older sisters scolded her severely and told her not to come home until she has found the missing clothing. The youngest one tried desperately to find the lost clothes in the river but was not successful. In her sadness she cried on the river bank. Suddenly a beautiful goldfish with shining golden scales appeared in front of her, jumping from the water and trying to cheer her up. The goldfish is magical and can talk to humans so introduced itself to her as \\"Leungli\\". Leungli finds out why the girl is crying and offers to help her to find the lost clothes. The girl is delighted when finally Leungli locates the missing clothes along the river. From then on Leungli becomes the girl's faithful friend, listening to her problems, comforting and cheering her. Every time she needed Leungli's company she would bring rice she had saved from her daily meal on a banana leaf plate to share. She would call by dipping the tip of her hair into the river and singing the pantun and shortly after the magical goldfish would appear. As the friendship between the girl and Leungli grows the older sisters notice a change in their younger sister's behaviour. She seems to have become stronger, more confident and happier, despite the abuse they continue to inflict. One day they curiously follow their youngest sister to the river and finally learn of Leungli's existence. The evil older sisters are envious and plot to catch Leungli. They copy the call used by their youngest sister and trick the magical goldfish, catching it in their net. Later that day the kind youngest sister tries to call Leungli at the river but Leungli does not come. She returned home saddened by the sudden loss of her friend. When she entered the kitchen she was shocked to find scales and fish bones on a plate which were clearly the remnant of Leungli. Her mean older sisters had cooked Leungli for their lunch. She cried heavily and buried Leungli's remains in her backyard. Magically from the grave of Leungli grew a golden tree with golden leaves and precious stones as the fruits. When anyone takes the golden leaves or the jewel fruits they turn to dust and disappear, except for the kind younger sister. She is the only one that can take the bounty of the magical tree. The story of magical tree spread widely within the kingdom and finally reached the palace. One day a handsome prince visited the village to see the famous magical golden tree, he finally learned about the story behind the tree and meets the youngest sibling. The prince admired the beauty and kindness of the youngest sister and they fell in love, got married, moved to the palace and lived happily ever after. Moral of the story Leungli is a popular Sundanese children folklore. This tale is a traditional pedagogical means to teach children to be kind to their siblings and other living beings including animals (in this case goldfish). The parents often recite this tale as a bedtime story and expect the children to take the role model of the kind and diligent youngest sister. The story also uphold the traditional moral theme, the good shall be rewarded and the evil shall be punished. The karmic theme and fable story that teach about benevolence and kindness is somewhat similar with Buddhism Jataka tales, it probably the trace of Sundanese traditional reverence to nature and also Hindu-Buddhist influences.

Early life Born in Grevenmacher on the Moselle, Seimetz first worked as a house painter and decorator until the industrialist Antoine Pescatore noticed his artistic talents and provided support for his education. In 1875, he began his studies in Brussels, continuing at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts (1879‚Äì1881) and finally at the French Academy (1881‚Äì1887).Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Frantz Seimetz\\", Ons stad No 64, 2000. Retrieved 30 April 2015. Career Seimetz was a prolific artist, creating over a thousand oils, watercolours and sketches of scenes in Luxembourg City and across the country. His work is however rather irregular compared to that of his friend Jean-Pierre Beckius who is regarded as the national \\"Moselle painter\\". His most fruitful period was in Echternach where he painted numerous scenes of the surroundings including the Mullerthal. His pictures are generally realistic and slightly romantic, bordering on Impressionism. Especially after 1900, his style became brighter and more colourful, reflecting the happiness and beauty of the moment he must have experienced. Seimetz himself was rather like his paintings. He was regarded as something of an eccentric with his full moustache, small beard and curly hair, his floppy hat and flowing clothes. Always optimistic and full of good humour, he led a rather Bohemian yet adventurous life. He travelled to Canada, the West Indies and Mexico. In the United States, he sailed down the Mississippi on a flat boat. His wife, Marie-Antoinette Bourger from Arlon, also a talented artist, did not object to the rather unstable life they led. After Echternach and then Arlon, in 1923 they moved to Luxembourg City where their house packed with old furniture is said to have looked like a museum. Many of Seimetz' portraits are of exotic figures he met on his travels but there are also excellent paintings of his wife and his Luxembourg friends including Michel Rodange, Sosth√®ne Weis, Michel Engels and Batty Weber. But his masterpiece is generally considered to be his portrait of a fair-haired girl. Many of his self-portraits are reminiscent of Rembrandt and Frans Hals. In 1932, Seimetz painted his last picture. Thereafter he took up writing, first in German, then in Luxembourgish and finally in his Moselle dialect. \\"Der Feuersalamander\\" is full of pleasant anecdotes and tales from his younger days as well as his passages describing his political and religious views. Today Seimetz is remembered as a conscientious artist who dominated the Luxembourg art scene for a considerable time. He was the first Luxembourger to delve into Impressionism and the first, after Nicolas Liez, to paint out in the open air. He was also the first Luxembourger who managed to live from art alone. Seimetz died in Limpertsberg, Luxembourg City, on 26 October 1934. Affiliations and awards *1904, Grand-Duc Adolphe Prize together with Dominique Lang.

She was previously the merchantman Wellesley, built in Calcutta in 1796. She successfully defended herself against a French frigate, and made two voyages to Britain as an East Indiaman for the East India Company. The Admiralty purchased her in May 1804; she then became a storeship in 1806. On her last voyage for the Royal Navy, in 1820, she carried settlers to South Africa. She was then laid up in ordinary. In 1828 she was converted to a prison ship and sailed to Bermuda where she served as a prison hulk until 1865 when she was sold for breaking up. Merchantman In late 1799 the Commissioners of the Navy engaged Bellona and Wellesley to \\"convey stores, &c.; to the different Settlements in India, on account of Government.\\"The Times, Wednesday, 25 December 1799; pg. 3; Issue 4675; col B Category: News. Wellesley was under the command of Captain Peter Gordon on 9 August 1800 when she encountered the French 36-gun frigate Franchise off the coast of Brazil. Wellesley was carrying provisions and stores for the fleet at the Cape and India; her crew consisted mostly of lascars and Chinese. The French frigate was the sole survivor from a surprising defeat of a French squadron in the Action of 4 August 1800. Captain Pierre Jurien, of Franchise, attacked Wellesley, but Gordon succeeded in driving him off. Gordon had about ninety men, including passengers. The engagement lasted about an hour and although the frigate had 12-pounder guns to Wellesleys 9 and 6-pounders, the British suffered no casualties. The frigate tailed the British for some two days, but then gave up. Wellesleys insurance company presented Gordon with a sugar bowl. tray, and pair of candlesticks, all inscribed, \\"Presented by the Bengal Phoenix Insurance Society to Capt. P.

Life Forbes was the second son of John Forbes, 8th Lord Forbes, by his first wife, Lady Margaret Gordon, eldest daughter of George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly, the leader of the Scottish Catholics at the time of the Reformation. Lord Forbes was a Protestant, and eventually drove his wife away. Their son John was a Catholic, as was his elder brother William, who had gone to Flanders and joined the Capuchin order, and his uncle, James Gordon, the Jesuit. Having changed clothes with a shepherd boy, John Forbes crossed over the sea to Antwerp, where he was arrested by a soldier of the Spanish army and imprisoned as a spy in Antwerp Citadel. On recovering his liberty he learned Flemish and Latin; and on 2 August 1593 became a novice in the Capuchin monastery at Tournai. A year later he took the solemn vows. He lived in the houses of his order at Bruges and Antwerp. It is related that at Dixmude he converted 300 Scottish soldiers to the catholic religion. His mother ultimately came to Flanders, and a pension was granted to her by the king of Spain. She died at Ghent on 1 January 1606, and her son John survived her only seven months, dying on 2 August 1606. He was buried in the nave of the Capuchin Church at Termonde. His brother William, also called in religion Father Archangel, died 21 March 1592. Biographies The life of John Forbes was written in Latin by Faustinus Cranius of Diest, under the title of Alter Alexius, natione Scotus, nobili familia oriundus, nuper in Belgium felici S. Spiritus afflatu delatus, et in familiam Seraphici Patris S. Francisci Cappucinorum adscriptus, sub nomine F. Archangeli, Cologne, 1620. It was translated into Italian as Narrativa della Vita d'un Figlio et d'una Madre, Modena, 1634. An English version, with Forbes's portrait prefixed, engraved by J. Picart, was printed at Douay, 1623, together with a memoir of Father Benedict Canfield, and The Life of the Reverend Fa. Angel of Ioyevse, Capvchin Preacher. These three biographies had previously appeared in French at Paris in 1621.

Life Forbes was the only son of Patrick Forbes of Skelater in Aberdeenshire, a branch of the Forbes of Corse. He entered the army when a boy of fifteen as a volunteer at the siege of Maestricht, and was successful in winning a commission. He was essentially a soldier of fortune, and when Portugal applied to Britain for officers to reorganise her army under the Count of Lippe Buckeburg, he was one of the first to volunteer. He took part in the defense of Portugal during the failed Franco-Spanish invasions of Portugal in 1762. Forbes remained in Portugal after the termination of the Seven Years' War; as a Roman Catholic who had married a Portuguese lady, he had no difficulty in getting employment. He acted for many years as adjutant- general of the Portuguese army, but at last, in 1789, he was asked to resign, the object of some jealousy of the Portuguese officers, and was made a knight of the order of Aviz, and promoted to the rank of general. When Portugal decided to join the French Revolutionary Wars, a corps was sent to assist the Spanish army in the War of the Pyrenees, under the command of Forbes. The Portuguese soldiers behaved well, but the commanders of the Spanish army were always at variance, and Forbes himself had much trouble with his adjutant- general, Gomes Freire de Andrade. The French republicans defeated the combined Spanish-Portuguese army, and Forbes returned to Portugal with his corps. He was too old to seek further active service, so he went to Brazil with Queen Mary I, the prince regent, and the court when they fled from the forces led by Jean-Andoche Junot, and on arrival there he was appointed governor of Rio de Janeiro. He died there on 8 April 1808.

In Nationen og Armeen, he argued that war in itself was a necessary baptism by fire, and that war contributed to the evolution of mankind. He became often referred to by the Norwegian labour movement, since he proposed budget increases that the labour movement thought too high.

The 7‚Äì2‚Äì2 was the base defense used by Knute Rockne at Notre Dame,Louis Little and Robert Harron, How to Watch Football: the Spectator's Guide, p. 51, Whittlesey house, McGraw- Hill, 1935. as well as Mike Donahue at Auburn. Into the late 1930s, the 7‚Äì2‚Äì2 was still commonly employed inside the defender's thirty-yard line. It was considered \\"very strong against a running attack, but rather weak defensively against passes.\\"The Book of Major Sports, p. 77, A.S. Barnes and Company, 1938. The 7‚Äì2‚Äì2 was also employed when the opponent was expected to punt.The First Book of Football, p. 47, Watts, 1958. Background The 1906 football rule reforms mandated that offenses use at least seven down linemen. These players usually stood shoulder-to-shoulder before the snap, a posture defenses tended to match. The defenses of the time are considered unsophisticated by today's standards. The interior defensive linemen were expected to hold their ground against their assigned blockers, while the responsibility of disrupting the offense rested primarily with the tackles and ends, especially those lined up on the \\"strong\\" side of the opposing line.Pro Football Formations 1: In the Beginning. . ., Hickok Sports, retrieved January 22, 2011. Over time, however, as new offensive formations, such as the single wing, were introduced, and increased the lateral running and passing threats, the seven man front changed in character. Box and letter drawings of the seven man front, by coaches such as Bernie Bierman and Steve Owen show a broadly spread front, with the center and two guards versus the interior five offensive linemen, defensive tackles 2‚Äì5 yards from the guards, and ends 2‚Äì5 yards outside the defensive tackles, and well outside the offensive ends.Bierman, Bernie, Winning Football, McGraw- Hill, 1937, pp 209‚Äì216.Owen, Steve, My Kind of Football, Prentice-Hall, 1952, p. 168. Improvements in offensive blocking schemes eventually made the seven- man line defenses vulnerable,The American Legion Magazine, Volumes 31‚Äì32, p. 64, The American Legion, 1941. but it remained a common formation, particularly against opponents with an unreliable passing attack, even into the 1950s. The abolition of the one-platoon system at all levels of the game by the 1960s effectively ended use of 7-man fronts except in goal-line situations; free substitution thus allowed bulkier offensive linemen to be taken out and replaced by nimbler linebackers, giving defenses more flexibility. The 3-4 defense can be seen as a modern variant of the 7-man defensive front (specifically the 7‚Äì2‚Äì2), with the cornerbacks (ends), outside linebackers (tackles), \\"defensive ends\\" (guards) and the nose tackle (center) all lined up roughly on the line of scrimmage. The key difference is in the spacing of the line (the linebackers and defensive ends are spread much wider than in the original 7-man front) and the fact that the outside linebackers and cornerbacks usually stand upright instead of crouching into a three-point stance.

This variation was seen from the 1940s to the 1960s. This defense is very similar to the 46 defense popularized by Buddy Ryan. The 7-1-2-1, or seven-diamond defense, used seven \\"down linemen\\", or players on the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, one linebacker, two safeties relatively close to the line and one safety farther downfield.Boys' Life, Vol. 36, No. 12, p. 27, ISSN 0006-8608, Published by Boy Scouts of America, Inc., December 1946. The formation was created by Minnesota coach Henry L. Williams in 1903, reputedly to stop Michigan back Willie Heston.Arch Ward, \\"Remember Him? Willie Heston of Michigan, Whose Plunging Forced Opponents to Use Seven Man Line\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, December 28, 1936. By some accounts in the mid-1930s, the 7-1-2-1 was considered \\"almost obsolete\\" due to its weakness against the forward pass, whereas the 7-2-2 defense was still considered viable.The American Magazine, Volume 120, p. 90, Crowell-Collier Pub. Co., 1935. Yet Bill Arnsparger notes the use of the seven-diamond from the 1940s into the 1960s, as a defensive adjustment to the common wide tackle 6 defenses of the time.Arnsparger, Bill, Arnsparger's Coaching Defensive Football, St. Lucie Press, 1999, pp. 57-58. Further, the form of the 7 diamond as derived from a wide tackle 6, with a more compact line spacing than the 1930s era 7 man lines, shows a marked similarity to the 46 defense of Buddy Ryan. Background The 1906 football rule reforms mandated that offenses use at least seven down linemen. These players usually stood shoulder-to-shoulder before the snap, a posture defenses tended to match. The defenses of the time are considered unsophisticated by today's standards. The interior defensive linemen were expected to hold their ground against their assigned blockers, while the responsibility of disrupting the offense rested primarily with the tackles and ends, especially those lined up on the \\"strong\\" side of the opposing line.Pro Football Formations 1: In the Beginning. . ., Hickok Sports, retrieved January 22, 2011. Over time, however, as new offensive formations, such as the single wing, were introduced, and increased the lateral running and passing threats, the seven man front changed in character. Box and letter drawings of the seven man front, by coaches such as Bernie Bierman and Steve Owen show a broadly spread front, with the center and two guards versus the interior five offensive linemen, defensive tackles 2-5 yards from the guards, and ends 2-5 yards outside the defensive tackles, and well outside the offensive ends.Bierman, Bernie, Winning Football, McGraw-Hill, 1937, pp 209-216.Owen, Steve, My Kind of Football, Prentice-Hall, 1952, p. 168. Improvements in offensive blocking schemes eventually made the seven-man line defenses vulnerable,The American Legion Magazine, Volumes 31-32, p. 64, The American Legion, 1941. but it remained a common formation, particularly against opponents with an unreliable passing attack,Louis Little and Robert Harron, How to Watch Football: the Spectator's Guide, p. 51, Whittlesey house, McGraw-Hill, 1935. even into the 1950s. The abolition of the one-platoon system at all levels of the game by the 1960s effectively ended use of 7-man fronts except in goal-line situations; free substitution thus allowed bulkier offensive linemen to be taken out and replaced by nimbler linebackers, giving defenses more flexibility. The 3-4 defense can be seen as a modern variant of the 7-man defensive front (specifically the 7-2-2), with the cornerbacks (ends), outside linebackers (tackles), \\"defensive ends\\" (guards) and the nose tackle (center) all lined up roughly on the line of scrimmage. The key difference is in the spacing of the line (the linebackers and defensive ends are spread much wider than in the original 7-man front) and the fact that the outside linebackers and cornerbacks usually stand upright instead of crouching into a three-point stance.

Life He was a grandson of Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough. Born on 4 December 1836 at Yeovilton in Somerset, Law was third son and fourth of eight surviving children of William Towry Law (1809‚Äì1886), Lord Ellenborough's youngest son, by his first wife, Augusta Champagn√© (died 1844), fourth daughter of Thomas North Graves, 2nd Baron Graves. The eldest son Augustus Henry Law was a Jesuit missionary, and the second son, General Francis Towry Adeane Law, C.B. (1835‚Äì1901), saw much military service. The father originally served in the Grenadier guards, but in 1831 had taken orders in the Church of England, and at the time of his son's birth was rector of Yeovilton and chancellor of the diocese of Bath and Wells, of which his kinsman George Henry Law was bishop. On the death of his mother in 1844, Law was sent to school at Somerton, but in the following year, after his father had moved to the living of Harborne in Staffordshire, he was successively sent to St. Edmund's School, Birmingham, and (as founder's kin) to Winchester College, then under George Moberly. In 1851 his father joined the Roman Catholic Church, so that Thomas left Winchester. In 1852 he studied at University College, London, where he had Augustus De Morgan and Francis Newman among his teachers, and in 1853 he entered Stonyhurst College. His father obtained for him a cadetship in the military service of the East India Company. In 1855, however, under the influence of his father's friend, Frederick William Faber, he entered the Brompton Oratory, London, where he was ordained priest in 1860. He remained in the Oratory till 1878, when, owing to a loss of his faith in the teaching of the Catholic Church, he left its communion. In 1879 Law was appointed keeper of the Signet Library in Edinburgh, and there he passed the remainder of his life. He was one of the founders, in 1886, of the Scottish History Society, and acted as its honorary secretary. In 1898 the University of Edinburgh made him hon. LL.D. After a long illness he died at his home at Duddingston, near Edinburgh, on 12 March 1904. Law was married on 15 April 1880 to Wilhelmina Frederica, daughter of Captain Allen of Errol, Perthshire, by his wife Lady Henrietta Dundas, and left one son, Duncan, and five daughters. Works Law's main historical interests lay in the sixteenth century, and its religious and ecclesiastical aspects. His major work is ‚ÄòThe Conflicts between Jesuits and Seculars in the reign of Queen Elizabeth‚Äô (1889). He also wrote many reviews and articles, some of which are in ‚ÄòCollected Essays and Reviews of Thomas Graves Law, LL.D.‚Äô (Edinburgh, 1904). To the Dictionary of National Biography he contributed sixteen articles, including those of David Laing, Edmund Law, Robert Parsons, and Nicholas Sanders. For the Camden Society he edited ‚ÄòThe Archpriest Controversy,‚Äô 2 vols. (1896‚Äì8); and for the Scottish Text Society, ‚ÄòCatholic Tractates of the Sixteenth Century,‚Äô 1901, and ‚ÄòThe New Testament in Scots,‚Äô 3 vols. (1901‚Äì3).

In spring 424 BC, the exiles from Mytilene seized Rhoiteion, but returned control of it to Athens when they were paid a ransom of 2,000 Phokaian staters.Thucydides 4.52.2, Kallet-Marx (1993) 155‚Äì9. Rhoiteion's greatest asset was the suitability of its coast for harbouring ships and its location on the Hellespont which connected the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea vis the Sea of Marmara; when it appears in the sources, it is usually for this reason. Famously, its coast was where the Achaeans beached their ships.Tryphiodorus, Iliou Persis 216, Libanius, Orationes 1.15, Scholia on Homer, Iliad 7.339b1, 14.36, 23.365, Scholia on Lycophron 276, 581. The Peloponnesian fleet put in here in the summer of 411 BC, and in 409 BC the Athenian fleet beached along these shores, sheltering from the winter storms.Thucydides 8.101.3, Xenophon, Hellenica 1.1.2. The promontory of Aeantion in the west of Rhoiteion's territory was commonly used as a harbour in Roman times:Cook (1973) 86‚Äì7. in Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written in the late 2nd century AD, Apollonius finds many ships at anchor here and takes passage on one, and in AD 324 the fleet of Licinius spent the night at anchor here before going into battle against Crispus.Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana 4.13, Zosimus 2.23‚Äì4. In modern times, locals have referred to most of the bays along this coast at one time or another as Karanlƒ±k Limanƒ± (Turkish ‚Äòconcealed harbour‚Äô).Cook (1973) 83. Outside myth (see below on The Tomb of Ajax), Rhoeteion is rarely mentioned after the Classical period. In 335 BC, prior to Alexander the Great's victory at the nearby Granicus river, one of his commanders, Calas, was beaten back by the Persians and forced to take temporary refuge at Rhoiteion.Diodorus Siculus 17.7.10. In the 3rd century BC, a ('Moirias the son of Antiphanes, citizen of Rhoiteion') is honoured as a proxenos in an inscription from Delos.IG XI (4) 582. Further citizens of Rhoiteion have been identified by Louis Robert: L. Robert, Etudes de Numismatique Grecque (1951) 10 n. 5, L. Robert, Monnaies antiques en Troade (1966) 19 n. 1. In 190 BC, the Roman commander Livius captured Rhoiteion from the Macedonian forces.Appian, Syriaca 23. Soon after, in 188 BC following the Treaty of Apamea, Rhoiteion was part of the Hellenistic Kingdom of Pergamon, and under the sway of Ilium.Strabo 13.1.39. At the beginning of the Hellenistic period Rhoiteion may have moved 1.8 km to the south-west from the Baba Kale spur to a site known as Tavolia () and remained there throughout the Roman period.Cook (1973) 83‚Äì6. This may explain a curious passage in Aelian, De Natura Animalium 25.16, in which the population of Rhoiteion is driven out by a plague of millipedes: Cook (1973) 86, Carusi (2003) 32. The Tomb of Ajax Rhoiteion was best known in Antiquity for the Tomb of Ajax, the Greek hero who had died during the Trojan Wars, which was located in the west of its territory near the war memorial at ƒ∞n Tepe (not to be confused with the town of the same name to the north- east).Cook (1973) 82 n. 6, 88‚Äì9. The association between Rhoiteion and the burial place of Telamonian Ajax (as opposed to Locrian Ajax) first appears in a fragment of the Hellenistic poet Euphorion of Chalcis (early 3rd century BC), who writes, \\"Purple hyacinth, one story of poets is that, on the Rhoetean sands, after the fall of the descendant of Aeacus [i.e. Ajax], you sprang up from his blood with a lament in your inscription\\".Euphorion of Chalcis, fr. 40 Powell. The Rhoetean shore appears in the Argonautica (1.929) of the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes (early 3rd century BC) without any mention being made of a connection with Ajax. The story does not appear again until it is picked up by the Roman poet Catullus (c. 84 ‚Äì c. 54 BC), an avid reader of Hellenistic poetry,Catullus Poem 66 is a translation and adaptation of the so-called Coma Berenices, a passage in the Aitia by the famous Hellenistic poet Callimachus. who in Poem 65 speaks of the unmarked grave of his drowned brother, \\"[where] under the shore of Rhoeteum the soil of Troy lies heavy\\".Catullus Carm. 65.8. In Book 6 of Virgil's Aeneid, published in full after his death in 19 BC, he refers to the tomb at Rhoeteion being that of Deiphobus, Ajax's great rival; it has been suggested that Virgil does this to upset a Roman reader's expectations, thus indicating that Rhoeteum was already associated with Ajax's tomb.Virgil, Aeneid 6.505; Bleisch (1999) 194‚Äì6. The poem Culex in the Appendix Vergiliana, which at lines 311ff contains an allusion to Telamonian Ajax being buried at Rhoiteion and which, like the rest of this collection, purports to be genuine juvenalia by Virgil, has long been recognized as spurious and is likely to date to the reign of Tiberius. By contrast, the Augustan poet Ovid in Book 11 of the Metamorphoses speaks of a place \\"on Trojan soil ... close to the sea, to the right of Sigeion, to the left of Rhoeteum\\" which is not Ajax's tomb or the Aeantion promontory (as the description might suggest), but instead \\"an old altar of Jupiter the oracular, god of the thunder\\".Ovid, Metamorphoses 11.196‚Äì8, cf. Ovid, Ibis 283. The geographer Strabo, writing in the latter half of Augustus' reign, relates that the Emperor Augustus returned to the Rhoiteians a statue of Ajax which had adorned the top of his burial tumulus until Mark Anthony had stolen it to give to his lover Cleopatra. Strabo then explains, \\"For Anthony took away the finest dedications from the most famous temples to gratify the Egyptian woman (i.e. Cleopatra), but Augustus gave them back to the gods\\".Strabo 13.1.30. Following the reign of Augustus, this became the dominant version of the myth for the rest of Antiquity.Pomponius Mela 1.96, Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia 5.125, Ps-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 5.7, Pausanias 1.35.3, Lucian, Charon sive contemplantes 23, Philostratus of Lemnos, Heroicus Olearius p. 738 line 18, Tertullian, De Anima 46, Dictys Cretensis 5.15, Scholia on Homer, Iliad 12.118b, Scholia on Sophocles, Ajax Hypothesis scholion 4. In Pliny the Elder (mid-1st century AD) we hear of the promontory near ƒ∞n Tepe referred to as Aeantion meaning 'the place of Ajax' (from Ancient Greek ).Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia 5.125. From the 2nd century AD onwards, was also spelt . Prior to this, the only mention of this promontory was in an Athenian inscription from 375 BC referring to a military action by the general Chabrias and honouring \\"the soldiers who were allies at Aianteion on the Hellespont\\".SEG 19.204 fr. b.2‚Äì3: , 'the soldiers who were (our) allies at Aianteion on the Hellespont'. In the 2nd century AD further details appear: the Greek travel writer Pausanias claimed that a local Mysian had informed him that the sea washed away the entrance to Ajax's tomb, and when locals looked inside, they discovered the bones of a giant man 11 cubits (or 5 metres) tall.Pausanias 1.35.3. This story recalls a common view in Graeco-Roman Antiquity that heroes of a previous age were much larger than present-day men; a famous example is the story of the discovery of the bones of Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, which the 5th century BC historian Herodotus relates.Herodotus 1.67‚Äì8. It was also in this period (probably during the reign of the philhellenic emperor Hadrian) that the tumulus of Ajax was renovated and given its present vaulting, suggesting local investment in what had become Rhoiteion's great attraction.Cook (1973) 88‚Äì9.

In 1967 it was recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is now vested in The Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands on the junction of St John's Street and Green Street and is open daily to visitors. History The tower, nave and chancel date from the late 12th century. During the following century the tower was raised and the chancel lengthened. A two-bay chapel was added to the north side of the chancel in about 1330. Later in the century windows were added to the lowest stage of the tower and to the west end of the nave. In the 15th century the north aisle and the porch were built, and the east window was added in the following century. In the 18th century repairs in brick were carried out. The north chapel was used as a schoolroom from the middle of the 17th century until about 1847. In 1874 the parish was united with the neighbouring parish of St Peter's, and St John's became derelict. Plans to turn the church into an RAF memorial chapel were in place in the 1940s but never passed. In 1947 the bells of St John's were removed and five of them were transferred to St Peter's Church. The same year an application was made by the Rector of St Peter's Church, Duxford to the Diocese of Ely to demolish the church as it had been \\"broken in to, defiled and misused in a great many and scandalous ways\\"; this was refused. The church was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 26 July 1979. The tower and the wall paintings were partially restored in 1985. Further restoration is ongoing. The church is still used for occasional services, events and an annual Advent Market in December. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in flint, pebbles and clunch, with clunch and limestone dressings. Repairs have been carried out in brick. The flat roofs are covered in copper, the nave roof is tiled, and the spire is covered in lead. The plan consists of a nave with a north aisle, a central tower, and a chancel with a north chapel. Along the north aisle wall are buttresses and three three-light windows. The north chapel has a diagonal buttress to the east, two windows and gargoyles. In the middle stage of the tower are small round-headed windows, and the bell openings in the top stage have two lights. Its parapet is battlemented, and on top of the tower is a small lead-covered spirelet. The spirelet is twisted; this was caused when a flagpole was tied to it in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, and it was damaged in a gale. The chancel east window has four lights. In the south wall of the chancel are a two-light window and a lancet window, and between them is a priest's door. The south wall of the tower is supported by two large buttresses, between which is a two-light window. The south wall of the nave contains a large three-light Perpendicular window. To the west of this is a timber-framed porch with a gable and plaster rendering including a small section of pargeting. This leads to the Norman doorway, which is decorated with chevrons, and its tympanum contains a rare stepped cross. =Interior= The Norman round-headed tower arches date from the 12th century. The west arch has three attached columns, and the east arch has a single column. At the base of the east arch is a pair of carved dogs. In the chapel are two ogee-headed niches and a cinquefoil- headed piscina. There is a niche with a round head on the east wall of the nave. The font dates from the 13th century, and has a plain octagonal bowl on a clunch pedestal. The communion rail, dating from the late 17th century, has barley-twist balusters. The benches date from the late 15th century, and the floor tiles from the 18th century. Inside the church is a variety of wall decorations, from medieval wall paintings to graffiti, some dating as late as the Second World War. From the medieval period are the images of two bishops in the north aisle, two further figures thought to represent Christ and the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and fragments of a possible Christ of the Trades which depicts working implements and would remind the congregation to keep the Sabbath holy, and that by using such working tools Christ would be wounded in turn. There is an Agnus Dei under the east tower arch flanked on either side by angels. On the west wall of the chancel are depictions of saints, including a female saint (possibly St Margaret) being tortured, as well as scenes from the Crucifixion and deposition of Christ. In the north chapel and arcade are graffiti from the time it was used as a school, some of which are in Latin. In the chancel is a long desk with copious graffiti, of particular note are two small coffins with skeletons visible inside. The most recent item in the nave is a depiction of Christ drawn by a look-out soldier during World War II. Also in the church are marks on stones caused by sharpening arrows during the Middle Ages. External features In the churchyard are two tombs, one bearing dates in the 19th century, the other without an inscription, which are designated as Grade II listed buildings.

Prague Quartet Their first performance took place in Ptuj on March 22, 1920. The Quartet relocated to Prague in 1921 where it was called the Czechoslovak Quartet (ƒåeskoslovensk√© kvarteto), and from 1929, the Prague Quartet. During the 1920s, the ensemble travelled and performed extensively around Czechoslovakia and Europe. In 1927, the Prague Quartet undertook a six month-tour of South America. During World War II when the Germans forbade nationalistic titles, it was known as the ƒåern√Ω Quartet (ƒåern√© kvarteto, 1943‚Äì1944).

Perkins (December 24, 1872-August 7, 1936) was an American educator and political activist. Perkins was the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Maine from 1925 to 1928. This was the high period of the Klan's ascendency nationally, and in Maine. He resigned in 1928 after a Klan-backed Republican candidate for U.S. Senator, Owen Brewster, lost his primary contest to Sen. Frederick Hale, signalling the eclipse of the Klan as a force in Maine politics. Personal and early life Perkins was in North Brooksville, Maine to Charles N. Perkins and Ruth Grindle. His father was a sea captain, storekeeper, and farmer who served two terms in the Maine House of Representatives as a Republican. A Methodist, he attended East Maine Conference Seminary in Bucksport, Maine but left before graduating. He married Jennie Powers on August 1, 1900. At the age of 18, Perkins was hired as a schoolteacher in Aroostook County, Maine. In the winter of 1896, Perkins joined the Freemasons. After teaching for six years, he returned to school himself when he enrolled at the University of Maine. Perkins was elected Sophomore Class President in 1897 despite being 25 years old. He graduated from Maine in 1900 with a Bachelor of Philosophy. Five years later, he earned a Master of Arts in History from Maine. He also attended summer schools at the University of Chicago and Indiana University. Perkins returned again to public education when he became principal of Freedom Academy in Freedom, Maine. He later became Superintendent of Schools first in Skowhegan & Madison, and then in Portland which was the largest school district in the state. In November 1910, he was elected President of the Maine Teachers' Association while working as the superintendent of schools of Madison, Maine and Skowhegan, Maine.Maine Journal of Education, November 24, 1910 He held the position as MTA president until the following year.Alumni Advisory Council The Maine Bulletin, General Information, 1912-13, Volume 15, Issue 1 He was also a serious candidate for Maine's Superintendent of Schools.Lewiston Evening Journal, Mar. 1, 1915, p. 9 In 1915, Sprague's Journal of Maine History described Perkins as \\"one of the ablest school officers in New England\\".Sprague's Journal of Maine History 195-1916, p. 45 In 1918 Perkins resigned his superintendency to become Executive Secretary of the Portland Chamber of Commerce. He was also President of the Portland Rotary Club (1916-17), a Four Minute Man during World War I, and a board member of United Americans, a group of super-patriotic organization. In January 1925, Perkins spoke at a public hearing of the Maine Legislature regarding altering the direct nomination primary system. He claimed that ‚Äúwe are ready, the fight is on, and 10,000 Knights of the Ku Klux Klan will stand behind the Direct Primary.‚Äù Six months later in July 1925, he was publicly introduced as Grand Dragon of the Maine realm of the Ku Klux Klan. During his time in that position, the Klan focused primarily on influencing state politics. He was a staunch supporter of Governor Owen Brewster. In 1926, Perkins was accused of conspiring with Republican Governor and the Klan's Imperial Wizard, Hiram Wesley Evans in a Washington, D.C. hotel room, to sabotage the candidacy of a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, Arthur R. Gould, who was running an anti-Klan campaign. Brewster and Perkins denied the charge, and Gould was elected with an overwhelming plurality. Brewster's subsequent primary loss to another anti-Klan candidate, Frederick Hale, in the next senatorial election of 1928 spelled the end of the Klan as an effective political force.David Mark Chalmers Hooded Americanism: The History of the Ku Klux Klan (Duke U. Press) pp. 278-79. Perkins was involved in real estate speculation throughout the 1920s. When the building boom slowed at the end of the decade, Perkins lost most of his property to his partners or to foreclosure. Perkins spent the final six years of his life (1930-1936) as a resident of Paris, Maine (now West Paris), where he was a shopkeeper. He died of appendicitis in a Portland hospital in 1936 and is interred at Wayside Cemetery in West Paris.

Set in the fictitious South African town of Piemburg, Riotous Assembly lampoons South African apartheid, and the police who enforced it. Plot summary Kommandant van Heerden, who has risen to Chief of Police of Piemburg through his family connection with a 'hero' of Boer republicanism rather than merit, is called out to deal with a strange murder case involving the eccentric British spinster, Miss Hazelstone. It appears that Miss Hazelstone has obliterated her black cook 'Fivepence' with a quadruple-barreled elephant gun. A paradoxical anglophile, van Heerden is initially willing to brush the incident under the carpet, until Miss Hazelstone reveals that she and the cook were former lovers (an offence under the Immorality Act) sharing a penchant for transvestism and rubber fetishism. In his panic to stop the truth getting out, van Heerden places Miss Hazelstone under house arrest, calling in all reinforcements available in order to quarantine the area and places his assistant, the profoundly stupid and bloodthirsty Konstabel Els, on guard, carrying the same elephant gun. The chaos that follows turns a potentially sensitive political scandal into a full-blown catastrophe, one that van Heerden, his deputy Lieutenant Verkramp and Els must resolve to uphold the 'honour' of Piemburg and apartheid.

It was first published in the short story collection The Book of Sand, as the collection's fourth entry. The story tells of the encounter the narrator has with a monstrous entity inhabiting an equally monstrous house. It bears the dedication \\"In Memory of H. P.

Flapperhouse Magazine, Fall 2016. Plot summary The story's protagonist, while in Austin, Texas, receives the news of the death of his uncle, Edwin Arnett, in Lomas de Zamora, Argentina. Shortly after, Arnett's house is bought by a man called Max Preetorius. Preetorius immediately disposes of all the furniture and initiates a series of modifications in opposition to Alexander Muir, the architect responsible for the original design of the house and the late Arnett's best friend. The modifications are performed under unusual conditions‚Äîduring the night with all the windows and doors closed. In addition, all trees within the bounds of the property are cut down. The protagonist is surprised by these events, and travels to Lomas de Zamora to investigate. He asks Muir and Preetorius' carpenter about Preetorius' intentions, and about the purpose of the strange modifications. He is unable to obtain any relevant information. He soon discovers that the inhabitants of the town deliberately avoid passing near the house. One of the locals tells him that one night, as his gaze wandered across the house's garden, he \\"saw something.\\" It is also reported that a missing dog was found decapitated and mutilated on the lawn. One rainy night, the protagonist is caught in the storm and is forced to enter the mysterious house; the front door is unexpectedly open. Once inside, his nose immediately detects what he describes as \\"a sweet, sickening smell.\\" Turning on the lights, he discovers strange, incomprehensible pieces of furniture, such as a long U-shaped desk with circular holes on opposite ends and a ladder with irregularly-spaced steps. When it stops raining, the horrified protagonist decides to leave. He hears the house's occupant moving between him and the door, and realizes that he will have to pass by the creature in order to exit the house. His curiosity overcomes his fear and he does not close his eyes as he does so. References Category:1975 short stories Category:H. P.

Mountain was directly related to Michel de Montaigne via his great- grandfather, who also resided at Ch√¢teau de Montaigne, and whose family fled from France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The younger Jacob Mountain was born at Thwaite Hall on 1 December 1749.T.R. Millman, Jacob Mountain: A Study in Church and State, Univ. of Toronto Studies, 1947 He was educated at various Norfolk schools, including Scarning, where he was a pupil of the classicist Robert Potter (1721‚Äì1804), and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1774 and MA 1777. In 1779 he was elected a fellow of his college, and, after holding the living of St Andrew's Church, Norwich, was presented to the vicarages of Holbeach, Lincolnshire, and Buckden, Huntingdonshire, which he held together. On 1 June 1788, he was installed as Castor prebendary in Lincoln Cathedral. He was consecrated at Lambeth Palace on 7 July 1793, and at the same time was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD; jure dignitatis). These preferments he owed to the friendship of William Pitt the Younger, who also, on the recommendation of George Pretyman Tomline, gave him the appointment of first Anglican Bishop of Quebec in 1793. At that time there were only nine clergymen of the Church of England in The Canadas ‚Äî at his death there were 61. For 30 years Mountain promoted missions and the erection of churches in all populous places, which he visited regularly, into old age. He also built the Anglican Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Quebec City. Jacob Mountain died at Marchmont House, Lower Canada, 16 June 1825 and was buried under the chancel of Holy Trinity Cathedral, which also contains a monument to his memory.

Her family returned to Korca in Albania and Kasimati was the first girl to attend the French inspired Albanian National Lyceum in Kor√ß√´. This gave her some fame for this achievement. One of her classmates was the future dictator Enver Hoxha. Taking her excellent French accent and her knowledge of the language she taught at the Korca Women's Institute. After this she studied biology at the American-Albanian in Koraja. The results she achieved enable her to gain a rare scholarship to study abroad. She attended university in Italy at Torino where she achieved perfect marks. She returned to work at the Albanian Institute of Science in Tirana after turning down a job offer at Torino University. She became Albania's first ichthyogist working under Selahudin Toto. She spent a decade documenting the fish of her country from a scientific and economic point of view as she believed that fish were an underused resource. She ignored social norms and lived alone in a flat in Tirana, but taking part in the intellectual life of the city. Her former schoolmate came to power and Kasimati was concerned when Albanian's first woman writer was interned and her former teacher Selahudin Toto was executed. Kasimati had an interview with Hoxha but to no avail. She was accused of planting a bomb in the Soviet embassy but the case was fabricated. Kasimati was accused under the new law of Agitation and Propaganda against the State and died near Tirana. She was shot without a trial, of any sort, on the night of 26 February 1951.

It is one of several semiconductor companies formed in the '60s and '70s by former employees of Fairchild Semiconductor. Intel, another one of these companies, was an early investor, holding a 22% share in the company. Reticon LC600: Early digital camera (1974) with linear photodiode sensor array of from 64 to 1024 elements. Used for noncontact measurements, process control, and position measurements in industrial applications. Co-founder Gene Weckler started Reticon after several years at Shockley and eight years at Fairchild Semiconductor. He served as VP from 1971 until 1997. He states that Reticon developed and marketed the first solid state imaging devices, the first digital imaging cameras, and the first computer-controlled vision systems marketed in the USA. They also introduced the first commercially available switched-capacitor filters, and a variety of discrete-time analog signal processing. Other founders included Ed Snow and John Rado. The company is known as a pioneer in certain technologies including the BBD (bucket-brigade device) and CCD (charge-coupled device). This included creation of such integrated circuits as the SAD512, SAD1024, SAD4096, R5101 and R5601. These were popularly used by companies such as MXR, Boss Corporation, Electro- Harmonix, A/DA and others in various electric guitar effects such as analog delay, chorus and flanging devices through the 1970s and 1980s. Reticon also made very steep analog filters useful for audio measurement. In 1977, EG&G; bought Reticon. In June 1999, EG&G; purchased Perkin-Elmer Analytical Instruments for $425 million. Reticon then became part of the new Optoelectronics division. Weckler went on to form Rad-icon Imaging Corporation in 1997, where he continued to work in semiretirement until 2009. The former Reticon group was shuttered by PerkinElmer in the mid 2000s, with some employees and assets transferring into the Amorphous Silicon division.

As one of the early Season 3 episodes that take place entirely in the parallel universe, the episode centers on Olivia, conditioned to believe she is a member of the alternate Fringe team, trying to track down a mentally unstable man that can predict the team's every move. \\"The Plateau\\" was co-written by Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, and directed by Brad Anderson. It featured the only appearance of guest actor Michael Eklund, who played the episode's antagonist Milo Stanfield. It first aired on October 7, 2010 to an estimated 5.2 million viewers. Reviews of the episode were mostly positive, and many praised the storyline and Eklund's performance. Plot Olivia (Anna Torv), trapped in the parallel universe, has been conditioned with drugs to believe she is her doppelganger, \\"Fauxlivia\\", by Walternate (John Noble), and has been integrated into the alternate Fringe team, though she is haunted by images of Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (Noble) from the prime universe. She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) are called to the scene of an accident where a pedestrian has been run over by a bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away. Olivia discovers ties between the three victims and a medical center. At the center, Dr. Levin (Malcolm Stewart) explains they help mentally challenged patients with experimental processes to boost their intelligence; Olivia observes one set of patients uses pens as they are unable to cope with digital devices. When Olivia and Charlie discuss the victims with Dr. Levin, he is able to identify their culprit as Milo (Michael Eklund), a patient taking an experimental drug to boost his IQ exponentially. Though released to care of his sole remaining family member Madeline (Kacey Rohl), he was scheduled to return to reverse the process for his own health and safety. Dr. Levin identifies all three victims as those charged to return Milo to the center, the last victim only having been selected the day before. They visit Madeline, who worries for the safety of her brother. She explains that Milo is able to predict the outcome of numerous events to the smallest detail, and only by showing him a toy horse, a connection to their deceased parents, can she break Milo's concentration. She provides Olivia and Charlie the location of the hotel that Milo is staying at. As they return to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and approach the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping to put on a respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side. That evening, Olivia has a vision of Peter; the vision tries to break Olivia from the conditioning, explaining that her lack of knowledge of the parallel universe saved her life. Production In late March 2010, Brothers & Sisters showrunners Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker were hired as co-executive producers for Fringe. The two had previously worked with Fringe co-creators Roberto Orci, J.J. Abrams, and Alex Kurtzman on Alias, and again with Abrams on Lost. \\"The Plateau\\" marked the first Fringe episode they co-wrote. Editor Timothy A. Good also joined the series, making \\"The Plateau\\" his first Fringe episode. Good called the episode one of two parts‚Äì the second half was the season's eighteenth episode \\"Bloodline\\", which Breen and Schapker also co- wrote. The episode premise was inspired by executive producer J.H. Wyman's son, who came up with the idea that a man could be smart enough to predict events. \\"The Plateau\\" marked the first appearance of a fringe case in the parallel universe. \\"The Plateau\\"'s storyline focused on Milo Stanfield (played by Michael Eklund), a man able to predict seemingly unpredictable events. The episode featured the return of guest stars Kirk Acevedo, Ryan McDonald, Seth Gabel, and Philip Winchester. New guest actors included Michael Eklund as the antagonist Milo Stanfield, Malcolm Stewart as Dr. Levin, and Kacey Rohl as Madeline. Eklund and other actors auditioned in Vancouver, and the producers reviewed tapes of their previous work. As executive producer Jeff Pinkner explains, \\"We got incredibly lucky casting Michael Eklund for this role... he really created this character.\\" \\"The Plateau\\" was the first episode of the third season to feature \\"Alt-Astrid\\", the prime universe Astrid's doppelganger. Actress Jasika Nicole depicted her to have autistic characteristics, as Nicole has a sister with the disorder. The producers decided this would be the one doppelganger to have actual genetic differences with their counterpart, with Nicole believing her two characters possessed the greatest contrast among all of the doppelgangers. Former Fringe producer Brad Anderson served as the episodes director. The episode was shot in August 2010, partly on Hastings Street in Vancouver. Anderson filmed the opening sequence in one day, which Owusu-Bree praised as \\"unbelievable.\\" The crew employed a stunt double for some of Eklund's more physical scenes, such as when he jumps onto a moving bus. Pinkner called the bus scene his favorite stunt on the series thus far. The hospital where Olivia and Charlie interview the drug trial doctor was filmed at the Toronto Public Library. There, the video the doctor showed them was added later by effects supervisor Jay Worth, forcing the actors to fake reactions to the images displayed. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children focusing on the science seen in \\"The Plateau\\", with the intention of having \\"students learn about chain reactions, where small changes result in additional changes, leading to a self- propagating chain of events.\\" Reception =Ratings= On its first broadcast on October 7, 2010, \\"The Plateau\\" was watched by an estimated 5.2 million viewers, earning a 2.0/5 ratings share for adults between the ages 18 and 49. Time shifting viewing increased the episode's ratings by 39 percent, finishing with a 2.8 rating among adults. =Reviews= Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker called the episode \\"at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple\\", especially when compared to previous episodes like \\"White Tulip\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining \\"I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool.\\" Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, and the use of split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode \\"demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint.\\" Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, I have no idea where that might be, or what's going to happen when we get there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out.\\" SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall thought the episode was similar to Flowers for Algernon, but was skeptical of the premise that Milo could predict every event before they happened. She criticized the decision to make Milo \\"coldly calculating\\", writing \\"This is but another version of the tired clich√© of the stoic intellectual, the intelligent person who has no heart or emotions. Why are we so afraid of smart people?... It always annoys me when science fiction writers, of all people, diss their own audience with the idea that intellectuals are dangerous.\\" Stegall was pleased to have the first \\"standalone\\" episode of the season, explaining that it was the first where she could \\"relax and enjoy... the tying together of a standalone with a mythology theme was absolutely brilliant.\\" Fearnet contributor Alyse Wax enjoyed the episode, but also thought \\"the idea that [drugs] could turn someone into a cartoonish evil genius is pretty farfetched.\\" Many critics praised Eklund and his character, with one calling Milo \\"spindly, intense, and nicely chilling\\". In a January 2011 article, The Futon Critic rated \\"The Plateau\\" the twenty- first best television episode of 2010 out of a list of fifty. The A.V. Club ranked Fringe the 15th best show of 2010, in particular citing \\"The Plateau\\" as a justification. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named \\"The Plateau\\" the thirteenth best episode of the series, explaining \\"The first half of Fringes celebrated third season alternated between episodes set in the over here and over there worlds. In a tough call, we say the best of the over there stand-alones was this brainy thriller about a dude with a low I.Q. who got an intelligence boost via nootopic drugs, and found himself becoming smarter and smarter, and more and more humanly detached, and causing chaos and death by concocting intricate chain reaction events.\\" In a similar list, Den of Geek named it the eighth best episode of the series, explaining that \\"The Plateau\\" stood out as \\"the best of a good crop of episodes\\" among the parallel universe storylines because of its villain and its use of Lincoln Lee, Charlie, and Olivia in action.\\" References External links * \\"The Plateau\\" at Fox Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 3) episodes ","title":"The Plateau (Fringe)"},{"id":"30611172","title":"Spirited (series 2)"},{"id":"30611177","text":"is a 2003 Japanese television drama series.

Her 13 short films have received 60 awards to date. She was married to the late animation producer Derek Lamb. After working with Lamb at the National Film Board of Canada in the 1980s, they formed their own production company, Lamb-Perlman Productions. She is currently a partner in Hulascope Studio, based in Montreal. Perlman has produced animation segments for Sesame Street and NOVA. Working with Lamb, she produced title sequences for the PBS series Mystery!, based on the artwork of Edward Gorey, and was one of the animators for R. O. Blechman's adaptation of The Soldier's Tale for PBS's Great Performances. She has also taught animation at Harvard University, the Rhode Island School of Design and Concordia University. She and Lamb were divorced but remained creative and business partners until his death in 2005. Penguin-related projects Perlman has created several films and books with penguin characters. Her short film The Tender Tale of Cinderella Penguin was adapted as the children's book Cinderella Penguin. Her satirical graphic novel Penguins Behind Bars was adapted as a 2003 Hulascope/NFB animated short of the same name, which received four awards including the Platinum Award for Independent Short Subject at the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival. The short aired on Adult Swim, Cartoon Network's late night programming block, in 2003, but was not made into a full series. She has also written and illustrated the books The Emperor Penguin's New Clothes and The Penguin and the Pea. National Film Board of Canada In addition to The Tender Tale of Cinderella Penguin and Penguins Behind Bars, Perlman's NFB credits include the 1976 animated short Lady Fishbourne's Complete Guide to Better Table Manners, winner of first prize in the instructional films category at the Ottawa International Film Festival, and the 2005 short Invasion of the Space Lobsters, a co-production of the NFB with the Canadian Labour Congress, which is a \\"tongue-in-cheek look at doublespeak and bafflegab.\\" She was an animator on The Hottest Show on Earth (1977) and co- directed Why Me? with Derek Lamb (1978), and contributed animation work to Alison Snowden and David Fine's Oscar-winning NFB co-produced short Bob's Birthday. =ShowPeace Series= While at the NFB, Perlman developed the ShowPeace animation series conflict resolution, including her short film Bully Dance, which received thirteen awards, including the Award for Best Animated Short Film from the Children's Jury and the Grand Prix de Montr√©al for Best Short Film at the Festival International du film pour enfants and First Prize in short film & video animation in recognition of outstanding achievement in children's media from the Chicago International Children's Film Festival. Another of Perlman's films for the series, Dinner for Two, received a dozen awards including a Grand Prix des Am√©riques at the Montreal World Film Festival and a UNICEF Jury Award for Best Short Film at the Berlin International Film Festival. Dinner for Two was later adapted by Perlman as the book The Delicious Bug. Hulascope Studio With film composer and former NFB colleague Judith Gruber-Stitzer, Perlman formed Hulascope Studio to produce animated projects for television. Penguins Behind Bars, a parody of the women in prison films of the 1950s, was co-produced by Hulascope and the NFB for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, and co-written by Perlman with Derek Lamb. Other works Perlman's latest film, originally entitled Llama Cookin, which was entered into the Ottawa International Animation Festival before it even existed. With the film due at the festival in just two weeks, Perlman quickly assembled Llama Cookin with animation outtakes from her computer. Unhappy with the results, she tried to withdraw the film from the festival online but couldn't figure out how to do so. So she changed the title of the film to Sorry Film Not Ready in the online entry form, hoping festival organizers would get the message. But when the two-week deadline came, Perlman received a notification that they had yet to receive a film entitled Sorry Film Not Ready and were extending the deadline. So Perlman completed a one- minute film under the title Sorry Film Not Ready and it was accepted by the Ottawa festival. At the 1994 Ottawa International Animation Festival, Perlman's short My Favourite Things That I Love proved popular but confusing to the audience, and the jury awarded her a tongue-in-cheek \\"Best Bad Taste Award\\" for the film. The film then went on to receive a \\"Most Horrible Music Award\\" from the Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

Biography Chapin was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1873. His popular work The Storks (1902) with Guy F. Steeley led to his work with L. Frank Baum, as he was recommended by M. Witmark & Sons, the publisher. Chapin is best known for his work with Baum on The Woggle-Bug, a 1905 musical based on Baum's novel, The Marvelous Land of Oz. He also wrote songs with lyricist Arthur Gillespie, two of which appeared, credited to Baum, in The Woggle-Bug. His other stage works include Pussy in a Corner (1904), The Forbidden Land (1904), The American Girl (1906), and The Maid and the Millionaire (1907). Chapin took up writing, and wrote the book and lyrics for The Maid and the Millionaire, and then produced a 1908 fantasy novel modeled on the Oz books titled Toodles of Treasure Town and her Snow Man,http://theozenthusiast.blogspot.com/2010/06/book-fairtime.html which he followed with Pinkey and the Plumed Knight (1909), both illustrated by Merle De Vore Johnson. On November 11, 1912, he opened a four-act farce called C.O.D. on Broadway at the Gaiety Theatre, which was fairly successful, in spite of many negative reviews such that one reviewer felt the need to quote reviews from The Sun and others, while The New York Times found the play funny and well acted.\\"C.O.D. Is a Funny Farce\\" The New York Times November 12, 1912. https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/11/12/100556823.pdf The day before the play opened, he told The Detroit New Tribune, \\"I wrote six plays-- every one turned out to have a great theme, but all were faulty in the way it was developed.\\" He claims to have completely rewritten C.O.D. prior to its production, claiming he threw the original script in the garbage and started from scratch after the fourth producer finally accepted it.\\"A Playwright's Confession.\\" The Detroit New Tribune, November 10, 1912.

The Association‚Äôs vision is the global adoption of data management standards and best practices throughout the upstream (exploration and production) petroleum industry. The focus of the Association is: * Continued development and support of the PPDM data model * Standard or baseline definitions of essential terminology * Best practices for developing a data governance strategy * Education and training around data management standards * Certification for E&P; (exploration and production) data management professionals. PPDM and the Need to Organize Petroleum Data Historically, petroleum data has been managed and analyzed using many different proprietary systems. These systems are typically built based on local terminology and business needs, and use different practices for identifying, gathering, transferring and interpreting information. A typical operating company may use dozens (or even hundreds) of software applications. Each department is tuned to the needs of different segments of the company; production accounting, field operations, seismic exploration, reserves management and financial departments all store information about wells in their respective software applications.First Break Magazine , First Break, January, 2005, accessed January 19, 2011. In 1989, one Calgary-based oil company and several of its software suppliers recognized that a non-proprietary data model was preferable to separate and private models. The creation of a comprehensive data model is an expensive and lengthy process. A private data model precludes the purchase of third-party software and other data-dependent services, without expensive customization. Therefore, a group of technical experts began work on a ‚Äúpublic‚Äù model, and other companies responded to the invitation to participate. As the model developed, more companies accepted the concept of non-competitive collaboration and recognized that there is little competitive advantage to using an exclusive private data model. In 1991 the cooperative workgroup was incorporated in Alberta as a not-for-profit society, the Public Petroleum Data Model Association. The initial data modeling efforts were on the requirements for well data in a relational database management system. Throughout the 1990s, the scope expanded to land rights, seismic surveys, well production and reserves, stratigraphy, records management, etc. Version 3.8 of the PPDM Model, released in 2008, covers 53 subject areas and has over 1700 tables. In 2008, the name was changed to the Professional Petroleum Data Management Association. This acknowledges the expansion of the products and services beyond just the data model, and emphasizes the focus on developing the professional practice of data management for the petroleum industry.  The Data Model  The PPDM Model is suitable for a master data management system. The specifications DDL are provided for use in Oracle and SQL Server systems. In addition, the modular design allows selected portions to be used in business-specific databases and applications. Although it was originally called a public model, it was never freely distributed by the Association. ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù always meant ‚Äúnon-proprietary‚Äù not ‚Äúfree.‚Äù The way to get the Model was (and still is) to become a member of the Association. However, many non- members around the world continue to use versions or adaptations of the PPDM model, usually because the model is embedded in a database or application purchased from a software provider. PPDM Lite, a simplified model based on Version 3.7, is available free to any registered user on the PPDM website. The PPDM Model is a set of specifications for creating a relational database. It is NOT a set of data for the petroleum industry. By analogy, the model is only the blueprint for a huge pigeon loft (birdhouse); it does not have birds already in the pigeon-holes. However, the Model contains a vast amount of knowledge about the industry‚Äôs business practices (how the data are acquired and used.) The Association estimates that Version 3.8 represents over $100 million of invested funds and human resources since inception.PPDM website , PPDM Version 3.8 Data Model, December, 2011, accessed December 2, 2011. .  Membership  The PPDM Association is a member-based society. Membership is open to corporations and individuals from around the world. The membership fee structure is based on the member‚Äôs financial size (revenues.) Over half the annual revenue is from companies based in the USA; the balance is from Canada and the rest of the world. Associate membership is available to individuals. Most of the activities of the Association are financed by the annual membership fees and carried out by people who work for the member companies. Special projects are funded by sponsoring companies who provide additional funds and specialist personnel. The Association‚Äôs office in Calgary has a small staff for technical support, communication, and administration. The members are represented by a board of directors. Each director is elected by the members to a term of two years (renewable.) They are mainly from large oil companies and software or data vendors.  Product Development Process  The real power of the Association, and the quality of its products, is rooted in the cooperative approach to development, ‚ÄúThe PPDM Way.‚Äù When several members recognize a data management need (e.g. expand the data model to a new subject area, or promote best practices for data governance), a draft charter is prepared. If the charter is approved by the PPDM board of directors, and sufficient resources are committed by the members, a workgroup is formed. Companies supply the workgroup participants who identify the business requirements in detail, and develop the technical solutions. Workgroup meetings are typically spread out over a year or more because the participants continue to be active in their regular employment.  Improving Communication  Semantic misunderstanding causes data errors and mistakes in analysis of the data.

The book was first published in 2005 by Doubleday as Freedom of Expression¬Æ: Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity, and in 2007 by University of Minnesota Press as Freedom of Expression¬Æ: Resistance and Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property. The paperback edition includes a foreword by Lawrence Lessig. The author recounts a history of the use of counter-cultural artistry, illegal art, and the use of copyrighted works in art as a form of fair use and creative expression. The book encourages the reader to continue such uses in art and other forms of creative expression. The book received a positive reception and the Intellectual Freedom Round Table of the American Library Association awarded McLeod with the Eli M. Oboler Memorial Award, which honors the \\"best published work in the area of intellectual freedom\\". A review in The American Scholar said that McLeod \\" ... delivers a lively, personal account of the ways intellectual property messes with people‚Äîand how he messes with intellectual property.\\" American Book Review said the work is \\"a clever compendium of examples\\" for those familiar with its subject matter. The Journal of Popular Culture called it \\"an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture.\\" Publishers Weekly said that McLeod's views echo prior comments about intellectual property by academicsincluding Lessig. Background Certificate of registration for \\"Freedom of Expression\\" from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (1998) McLeod first published the book as a compilation of writings in magazine format. Freedom of Expression was first published in book form in 2005 by Doubleday as Freedom of Expression¬Æ: Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity, and in 2007 by University of Minnesota Press as Freedom of Expression¬Æ: Resistance and Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property. The 2005 edition of the book was made freely available via a Creative Commons license. The Media Education Foundation released a DVD documentary film in 2007 featuring McLeod, Jeremy Smith, Sut Jhally, and Jeremy Earp. The documentary was narrated by Naomi Klein and included interviews with Lessig, Siva Vaidhyanathana University of Virginia academic in media studies; Inga Chernyaka co-founder of Free Culture at New York University, and Mark Hosler of Negativland. Contents Kembrew McLeod (2010) In Freedom of Expression¬Æ, Kembrew McLeod discusses the concept of freedom of expression regarding cultural norms and the manner in which society allows corporations to influence discourse. McLeod discusses his own pranks, such as his 1998 registration of the phrase \\"freedom of expression\\" as a trademark. In 1998, he registered the phrase \\"Freedom of Expression\\" as a trademark in the United States, and said he would initiate a lawsuit against individuals who subsequently used this phrase without his permission. McLeod said, \\"If the ACLU wanted to put out a magazine with [the] title Freedom of Expression, they would have to pay me royalties.\\" After the telecommunications company AT&T; used the phrase during a marketing campaign, McLeod's attorney sent a cease and desist letter to request that AT&T; stop using his trademarked phrase. In his book Owning Culture: Authorship, Ownership, and Intellectual Property Law, McLeod said that his intention with the registration of \\"Freedom of Expression\\" was to initiate social commentary in the media, saying, \\"I would let the news story itself be the social commentary.\\" The trademarked phrase subsequently fell back into the public domain. McLeod also discusses the history of counter-cultural artistry, recounting episodes such as Dadaist art styles and an incident in which Vanna White initiated a lawsuit against a robot likeness for copyright infringement. He explores the concept of fair use and encourages the reader to use copyrighted works in alternative forms of artwork. He also gives a history of the song \\"Happy Birthday to You\\", information about the music industry's use of sampling, and discusses illegal art. McLeod said that the threat of a lawsuit from a company is not necessarily an indication of actual criminal activity, and these threats against artistry and creativity can be overcome through determination. Reception In 2006, the Intellectual Freedom Round Table (IFRT)a committee of the American Library Association (ALA)awarded McLeod the Eli M. Oboler Memorial Award, which recognizes the \\"best published work in the area of intellectual freedom.\\" In a press release statement upon presenting McLeod with the award, Committee Chair Fred Stielow commented, \\"McLeod captures the growing switch from a balanced compromise between the creator's rights and public access. In its place, the author wittily exposes a stifling shift of copyright law into an instrument of commercial interests.\\" McLeod was the only recipient of the Eli M. Oboler Memorial Award in 2006. In a review of the book for The American Scholar, Siva Vaidhyanathan of New York University wrote that MacLeod \\" ... delivers a lively, personal account of the ways intellectual property messes with people‚Äîand how he messes with intellectual property\\", and that, \\"McLeod is ironic and witty, writing with a hip-hop-influenced youth- savvy diction that demonstrates his confidence and engagement with the material and the culture that means so much to him.\\" Davis Schneiderman wrote positively of the work in a review for American Book Review, comparing it to similar works on the subject matter, including No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies (2000) by Naomi Klein, and writings of Michael Moore and Al Franken. A review by Eric Anderson of Bowling Green State University in the Journal of Popular Culture praised the author's use of interviews throughout the book, writing that it \\" ... shines with McLeod's broad use of interviews ... [he] records and reports the voices of creative people who have been encumbered by the contemporary intellectual property regime. The incorporation of these interviews, demonstrating as they do specific examples of creativity obstructed in specific ways, is this book's most important contribution.\\" Anderson said the book is \\"an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture.\\" Anderson mentions McLeod's and the book's publisher's uncommon tactic of making the book freely available via a Creative Commons license. Publishers Weekly reviewed the book and compared McLeod's tactic of following his trademarked phrase with \\"¬Æ\\" as a satire of Fox Network's registration of the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" as a trademark. The reviewer wrote, \\"While McLeod's arguments aren't original, his entertaining examples and punchy writing nicely amplify the concerns voiced by an increasing number of intellectual property scholars, such as Lawrence Lessig.\\" The reviewer said of the author's tone, \\"Although he evokes dark, almost Orwellian images throughout, McLeod manages an upbeat spin, citing the 'egalitarian' nature of the new technologies and a growing awareness of the need to return to a place where 'freedom of expression' is once again 'a meaningful concept that guides our political, social and creative lives.'\\" See also * Censorship * Censorship in the United States * Free content * Freedom of speech by country * Freedom of speech in the United States * Freedom of the press * International Freedom of Expression Exchange * WikiLeaks References Further reading ;Book reviews * ;Related  External links * Kembrew.com, Author's homepage * Freedom of Expression¬Æ Security Consortium * ‚Äî book available as download with Creative Commons license Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:American political books Category:Books about creativity Category:Books about freedom of speech Category:Works about intellectual property law Category:Works about trademark law Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:University of Minnesota Press books ","title":"Freedom of Expression (book)"},{"id":"30611474","text":"The Mus√©e des beaux-arts d'Orl√©ans is a museum in the city of Orl√©ans in the Loiret department and the Centre-Val de Loire region in France.

The museum was then installed in l‚Äôh√¥tel des Cr√©neaux. In 1855, the historical collections were separated from the art collections to form the Mus√©e Historique et Arch√©ologique de l‚ÄôOrl√©anais, which moved into the Hotel Cabu.

Life He was born around the year 1535 in the village of Rakouch (Rakovo), in Tur√≥c County, which is now in the Martin District of the ≈Ωilina Region in Slovakia. Before 1554, he studied at the school in K√∂rm√∂czb√°nya/Kremnitz, now Kremnica. Thereafter, he moved on to B√°rtfa/B√°rtfeld, now Bardejov, where he studied with noted humanist Leonard St√∂ckel, and later Brass√≥/Kronstadt, now Bra»ôov before spending 1555‚Äì56 at the University of Wittenberg studying under Philip Melanchthon, an associate of Martin Luther. In 1556, Rakovsk√Ω studied in Prague briefly before returning to Wittenberg to earn his master's degree, which he did in 1558. During his time of education, he served as rector of the school in Saaz in 1556 and then at Loun from 1557-1559. Between 1559-1569, Rakovszky served as a clark of the Royal Chamber of Hungary in Pozsony, Pressburg in German, now Bratislava, which was the capital of Royal Hungary at that time as the country's historical capital Buda (now part of Budapest) was occupied by the Ottoman Turks in 1541. During Turkish incursions into the region during the late 1560s, Rakovszky stayed at the mansion in Tur√≥ckelemenfalva, now Kaƒæamenov√° where he participated in defending his family's property against the Turks in 1569. Rakovszky died suddenly on a visit to his brother Mikl√≥s's house in Kutn√° Hora in 1579. Historical context and family The Rakovszky family name went through a number of variations over the years, including: de Rakouch, Rakouczky, Rakoczy, Rakovsky, Rakovszky. All of which are found in the \\"Royal books\\" (Liber Regis). His ancestor L√°szl√≥ de Chernek was in the entourage of the Hungarian king B√©la IV in the battle of Muhi against the Tartars/Mongols in 1242. For his and his brother's (M√°rton de Chernek, a royal chaplain) loyalty they were given estates at Zanasan in Tur√≥cz, while still retaining some south-east of lake Balaton. (Documents from 127x). Work He was one of the most accomplished and widely known humanist scholars of the 16th century, with some of his work gaining notice in a larger European context. During his studies in Wittenberg, he published a verse translation of the astronomy textbook Procli sphaera. Upon arrival in Prague, he soon became part of the humanistic scholarship ring of Jan, Elder of Hodƒõjov. Elder Jan influenced Rakovsk√Ω's poems in his work Elegiae et epigrammata (1556), which mostly included hymns and poems written in honor of prominent personalities of the then current Czech life. Rakovszky further developed his poetry by focusing on humanistic civil and political poetry during his time in Loun. The city of Prague is celebrated in his work Boiemicae Lunae Descriptio Urbis (1558) wherein there are hymns dedicated to the city and its character, prayer, speech and exercises, as well as other incidental poems. After arriving in Pozsony (now Bratislava, a name invented much after his death), Rakovszky wrote Libellus de partibus reipublicae et causis mutationum regnorum imperiorumque, a civil and political commentary dedicated to Emperor Maximilian II. This work analyzed the social strata in the country and indicated its place and function in society.

In Avdi Square, the city added 39 trees, 112 bushes, 500 flowers, 1,000 square metres of grass, and 271 square metres of new tile surface. On 21 July 2008, following the completion of the renovation, Mayor Nikitas Kaklamanis held a public ceremony to hand over the square to the area's citizens for caretaking and use as a recreational oasis. \\"This square will become the heart of culture and recreation in your neighbourhood,‚Äù he said during the launch of the revamped space. The square is named for Leon Avdis (1937‚Äì2000), a Greek lawyer and public servant who enjoyed wide respect across the political spectrum. In 1994 he was elected Municipal Councillor of Athens as head of the \\"Fighting Cooperation for Athens\\" coalition. Avdis was elected to Parliament in 1996 on the Greek Communist Party (KKE) ticket, then resigned in 1997 to run for mayor of Athens. His platform including improving living conditions in run-down areas and creating bicycle lanes in the capital.

Frank Baum, with book and lyrics by the author and music by Frederic Chapin that opened June 18, 1905 at the Garrick Theater in Chicago under the direction of Frank Smithson, a Shubert Organization employee. The musical was a major critical and commercial failure, running less than a month. Chapin, however, had proven quite saleable to the publisher, M. Witmark and Sons, and many of the songs were published. The music director was Frank Pallma. The surviving sheet music was published by Hungry Tiger Press in 2002. Background After the success of The Wizard of Oz on Broadway in 1903, Baum set out immediately to write a sequel, The Marvelous Land of Oz; Being an Account of the Further Adventures of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, which was published in 1904. The book was dedicated to the stars of the musical, Fred A. Stone and David C. Montgomery, who had been made majors stars by the show. However, The Wizard of Oz was still running, and Montgomery & Stone refused to leave it to do an untested sequel. As a result, the story had to be heavily overhauled to eliminate the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, as the novel had excluded Dorothy Gale and the Cowardly Lion, neither of whom were major draws in the stage show. The Woggle-Bug is made the driving force of the story, when he had been introduced fairly late in the novel (Chapter 12 of 24), and did not make a major contribution to plot, only to characterization. His introduction is moved to the beginning of the play, and he is given a subplot about chasing after a checked dress with which he has fallen in love. The Scarecrow is replaced with a Regent named Sir Richard Spud, and the Emerald City is renamed \\"the City of Jewels,\\" although it is still stated (if only in the lyrics) to be set in Oz. Glinda is replaced with Maetta from The Magical Monarch of Mo, as she had appeared in several versions of the earlier musical. Unlike The Wizard of Oz, no songs were subsequently interpolated, although the show did not have a long enough run for that to be likely. Two of the songs were not originally written for the musical, \\"Sweet Matilda\\" and \\"Soldiers.\\" They were songs that Chapin had composed with lyricist Arthur Gillespie prior to his collaboration with Baum. Gillespie, however, was denied credit, and Baum is credited as lyricist for both songs. It was apparently retooled at several points. The program printed in the Hungry Tiger Press sheet music collection comes from late in the run--\\"The Equine Paradox\\" is not mentioned, and the play is presented in two acts rather than three. The novel was later adapted as The Marvelous Land of Oz in 1981 with a book by Thomas W. Olson, lyrics by Gary Briggle, and music by Richard A. Dworsky. Synopsis =Prologue= A cornfield, with the profile of Mombi's hut at right, in a purple-tinted farm landscape filled with pumpkins. Tip exits Mombi's hut, dragging a wooden form of a man behind him, props him up on a central shock of corn, and begins carving a face upon it. (He is unfamiliar with Jack O'Lanterns and does not open or empty the pumpkin, but came to the idea himself.) When he realizes that Mombi is coming, he hides behind a large shock of corn. Mombi is at first frightened, as Tip intended, but then she decides to test a box of Powder of Life. The Pumpkinhead comes to life, and the Harvest Sprites bow to him, and while Mombi dances with glee that the Powder works, Tip takes the Pumpkinhead by the hand and leads him away. =Act I= Scene 1 Interior of a country school house The schoolchildren enter the classroom of Professor Knowitt and do their introductory exercises and school song, \\"My Native Fairyland\\". The Professor finds a Woggle-Bug on the floor and the children all want to see him. With a magic magnifying glass, the Professor projects the Woggle-Bug onto a screen, from which he steps down and introduces himself as \\"MR. H.M. WOGGLE-BUG T.E.\\" Professor Knowitt is frightened and tries to get him to go back up on the screen. The Woggle-Bug tries to impress the professor with his knowledge, but delivers such malapropisms as \\"patties\\" for \\"patois,\\" following each with a pun. Mombi enters and inquires if anyone at the school has seen Tip. The Woggle-Bug says no. She mistakes him for a masquerader, but he introduces himself and says that he is at her service. She asks him for help, telling him Tip has run away with the Pumpkinhead, which he mistakes for a romance. She tells him that they have stolen the Powder of Life, worth a million dollars an ounce, because it can bring anything it touches to life. The Woggle-Bug suggests trying it on the Democratic Party. The Professor then insists that the Woggle-Bug is his property to prevent him to go, and the Woggle-Bug retorts that if he is held after school that his parents will bite the Professor. Five peasant women, who speak as ungrammatical hicks (e.g., \\"You bet we is.\\"), Prissy, Jessica, Flinders, Melinda, and Bettina enter looking for General Jinjur. The Woggle-Bug falls immediately in love with Prissy's checked dress. The Professor and the Woggle-Bug try to dissuade the girls from war, the Woggle-Bug saying that \\"it is better to be a Maud Muller than a Carrie Nation.\\" He tries to take the dress from her, and when Mombi reminds him that he promised to help her find Tip and the Pumpkinhead, he tells her that that was before he \\"knew the pangs of love.\\" Jinjur enters, and all bow to her. She asks Mombi to join her Army of Revolt, which is encompassed \\"of gallant milkmaids and scullery ladies\\" who seek to wrest power from the men who run the City of Jewels. Mombi refuses, but says she will use her magic to aid them in exchange for getting Tip back when the conquest is over. She asks who else will assist them, and Professor Knowitt agrees. The five peasant ladies beg to join her army, Prissy promising to defend her \\"till death, then I'll resign.\\" Unsure that they will make a contribution, Jinjur calls them the \\"Awkward Squad\\" and names Prissy their captain. Knowitt and Jinjur reminisce about how they attended that very school. Jinjur remembers how Tommy Bangs courted her and called her \\"Sweet Matilda\\", and Knowitt reminds her that he attempted to court her, too. Scene 2 \\"Outside the Gates of the City of Jewels\\" Jack Pumpkinhead awakes to the sound of an alarm clock, tries to mess with it in denial, then wakes Tip, who grudgingly accepts that Jack calls him \\"Papa.\\" Tip says that he dreamed that he was once the Princess Ozma who ruled over the City of Jewels that they now sit before. He explains to Jack why he can't just go to the city gates and claim that he is Princess Ozma, because he isn't just now, having been enchanted by Mombi. They exit to search for an entrance to the city less grand than the one they are before, and as they leave, the morning workers enter delivering their song, \\"Ting-a-Ling-a-Ling\\". Unable to find another entrance, they decide to steal into the city by climbing over a wall, making use of a nearby sawhorse. Jack convinces Tip that since they are both made of wood, and Tip has the Powder of Life, that the horse should be alive, too. Tip sprinkles the sawhorse, who springs immediately to life, but Tip has to carve him ears and put them on so that the horse can hear him. Jack suggests that having the horse will help Tip become a princess, but laments that she will get married and leave him when that happens. Tip says that when he was a princess, he had many lovers, one of whom almost won her, in spite of \\"mamma's watchfulness\\" and tells the story in \\"My Little Maid of Oz\\". The Regent and Lord Stunt enter, followed by guards and courtiers. The Regent longs for simplicity and is immediately charmed when Tip addresses him with, \\"Hello, Mr. Regent,\\" rather than by some grand address and says that he and Jack must be disciples of \\"the great Vogner.\\" Tip explains to the Regent that he was Princess Ozma, and the Regent, eager to retire, promises to find Mombi and force her to change Tip back into Ozma. Until then, the Regent invites Tip to share the palace, leaving Jack behind to meet the arriving Woggle-Bug. After comic banter and an unidentified song and dance, Mombi enters wearing the checked dress, and the Woggle-Bug begins to woo her. He then exits to aid the conquest, the two blowing kisses at one another. Mombi can't remember when anyone ever loved her before. She says it makes her feel naughty just thinking of it, as if she were caught writing letters to Beatrice Barebacks. She then laments that \\"The Hobgoblins\\" would stop associating with her were she to get married, then exits. Prissy enters with the soldiers, and Jack thinks that fighters are married people when Prissy explains what they are doing. Mombi re-enters and tries to catch Jack, promising not to hurt him. The Regent, Stunt, Tip, Woggle-Bug, and sawhorse enter. The Regent pushes the Woggle-Bug away from Mombi and commands her to restore Tip to his proper form. She calls him a fool because it will cause him to lose his job. He threatens her with execution, but the Army of Revolt enters and begins its conquest of the city. Prissy, \\"in an absurd uniform,\\" carries a banner declaring \\"Give us Victory, or Give us Fudge,\\" while other women have more straightforward, if ungrammatical, banners of protest. Professor Knowitt wheels in a commissary cart filled with huge packages of fudge. \\"Soldiers\\". The Regent tries to talk Jinjur and Prissy out of war, to no avail. The Woggle-Bug retreats from the charge along with the Regent, Tip, and Jack, and after the battle, the city burns, the four are taken prisoner, and the soldiers chant \\"The Paean of Victory\\". =Act II= Scene 1 \\"The Courtyard of the Royal Palace of Princess Ozma\\" Jinjur sits on the throne with her feet stretched out on a stool. Servants pass chewing gum to the soldiers who now play games. When a fight breaks out among the girls, she orders them to stop fighting, and to put away their games if they cannot play them without fighting. The women sing the chewing gum song, \\"To the Victors Belong the Spoils\\". Jinjur scolds Prissy for hooking her uniform from the back, calling her a turncoat. Prissy then realizes that she can't remember which house she has chosen as her own and sings \\"I'll Get Another Place\\".The bit about her unable to find her house is tipped in on a handwritten page to the second version of the manuscript on the reel. Some of the writing is too faint to say definitively that the song occurs here, but it is mentioned nowhere else in the script. The song was not published and is known only from its mention in the program. Prissy complains that she tried to bathe in champagne as advised by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, but the sawhorse pulled the plug and she had to bathe in mineral water instead. Jinjur gives Prissy a medal, then orders the soldiers to clean up their games. The men then enter sweeping, dusting, and wheeling baby carts and sing \\"The Household Brigade\\". Bettina admits the Regent, now a slave, whom Jinjur fancies to marry, but he wants a retiring life in the country, and would not be interested in her unless she resumed being a milkmaid. She decides to lock him up in a luxurious room until he is willing to be hers. Jack and Tip enter, Jack having been made a baker's man, and the two sing \\"Patty-Cake, Patty-Cake, Baker's Man\\" and exit. Mombi enters and demands Jack and Tip from Jinjur, insisting that she is responsible for their victory and that Jinjur is her slave. She threatens to change Tip back into Ozma and lose Jinjur the throne. Jinjur repeatedly calls Mombi beautiful to get her to destroy Tip, Jack, and the Woggle-Bug. Mombi does not want to kill Tip, but finally agrees. Jack enters, and Mombi promises to spare him if he obeys her. She orders him to stay put, and when she leaves, he sings \\"Jack O'Lantern\\", then exits. When Mombi returns with Jinjur, she promises to feed the Regent a love potion. At Jinjur's command, the Army brings in Tip and the Woggle-Bug, and the Awkward Squad brings in Jack. Mombi says that she will transform Tip into a marble statue to prevent him from further declamations that he is Ozma, have the pumpkinhead turned into a pie and served to the army with cheese, then orders in Aunt Dinah, the cook (a mammy caricature played by a man), and demands the Woggle-Bug to be cooked Newberg style on toast. When Dinah arrives, she is wearing the dress, and the Woggle-Bug makes his move. Dinah thinks that he is a lobster and rejects him, and he sings his lament, \\"There's a Lady-Bug A'Waiting For Me\\", and all exit. Meanwhile, Professor Knowitt and Prissy have fallen in love. Their romantic meeting is interrupted by the Woggle-Bug complaining that he is lost without the love of his life. Prissy wants Knowitt to squash the bug, but he refuses, and offers to save him from Dinah by reducing him. He refuses. Prissy says that to save himself from heartbreak, he should cut a piece of the dress with shears and wear it by his heart. After the Woggle-Bug leaves, Knowitt asks Prissy to marry him, and they sing \\"The Doll and the Jumping-Jack\\" (a song about lovers forced to part by outside circumstances) and exit. The Woggle- Bug, Tip, and Jack build The Gump to escape. Jinjur, Mombi, Prissy, and Knowitt enter as they leave by air, but none will follow Mombi's orders to stop them. Tip says they are going to the palace of Maetta the Sorceress. Mombi does an incantation around the cauldron, joined by other witches and followed by a dance of black cats. Scene 2 Dumped in a pasture by The Gump, the three, deciding that they are safe for the moment, reminisce about \\"The Things We Learned at School\\", then exit hurriedly when a storm begins. Soon after, they are intimidated by a chorus of chrysanthemums with the faces of the Army of Revolt, who move and block their path whichever way they go. The Woggle-Bug demonstrates that his father was a wizard and summons a flood to stop them. When the flood subsides, they see Maetta's palace in the distance outlined by electric lights. =Act III= Maetta the Sorceress is seated on the throne. Her talisman tells her that strangers have arrived. She has her favorite page, Athlos, admit them. Tip kneels before Maetta, pleading to be restored to his true form. After Tip reiterates the plot, Maetta has Athlos send fairies to bring Jinjur, Mombi, Prissy, and Knowitt to the palace. Maetta asks what the others want from her, and Jack says that he wants a way to preserve his head, and the Woggle-Bug, the dress. The sawhorse then chases the Regent into Maetta's palace. The Regent says that he escaped from Jinjur aboard the sawhorse, who then tried to kick his brains out for suggesting he teach him about the Simple Life. He explains that he would have Jinjur as Mrs. Spud, but not with himself as Mr. Jinjur. Maetta's attendants bring in the prisoners, with Jinjur dressed as a milkmaid and Prissy wearing the checked skirt and a coat covered in medals. Maetta orders Athlos to cast Mombi into the dungeon, the latter spewing insults at the others as they drag her away. When Maetta takes away Jinjur for her punishment, Jack wishes that they all had sawhorses, and the Woggle-Bug works his magic, summoning six sawhorses for the number, \\"The Equine Paradox\\" (Tip, Woggle-Bug, Jack, Regent, Prissy, Professor). Maetta returns, and orders Prissy to become a housemaid, and her military honors stripped. Maetta's attendants do so forcefully, as Prissy screams and struggles, then they march her off. Maetta disbands Jinjur's army and forces her to become a milkmaid. Jinjur protests that Tip can't be queen, so Maetta has him rest his head on her lap, singing \\"The Sandman Is Near\\" to him, and Ozma emerges during the second chorus. The Regent, seeing Jinjur as a milkmaid, wishes to marry her, and she agrees. Ozma promises to make Jack her prime minister. When the Professor announces that he and Prissy are to be married, Maetta decides this is sufficient punishment for them. The two go off, but the Woggle-Bug seizes Prissy's skirt, demanding it be his. She tears it off and throws it in his face. He then puts it on as a vest under his coat and sings a reprise of \\"Mr. H.M. Woggle-Bug, T.E.\\" with the ensemble. As the song concludes, an attendant places a large tin can, labeled \\"Canned Pumpkin\\" over Jack's head.

This is not the complete score, only a complete collection of published sheet music from Witmark. Numbers 1, 2, 5, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19, and 21 are not included, as they were not published as song sheets and are not known to survive. Witmark claimed to have published a complete piano score, but there is no evidence that this was ever done. Although the script survives, Hungry Tiger Press elected not to include it. Reception Burns Mantle described the play as \\"entertainment pap for the little ones,\\" and \\"smothered in a simplicity in which the child mind will revel, and before which the adult mind will nod.\\" Like many critics, he found Mabel Hite to be the standout performance, calling her a \\"miniature Marie Dressler.\\" He found the screen projection of the rain of cats and dogs to look like corpses and lambasted the moment of toy balloons shot through a cannon. Illustrating his article with a head shot of Mace, he found him \\"as a comedian, hopelessly buried.\\" He described Hal Godfrey as \\"a very fair imitator of Stone's scarecrow.\\" He liked Blanche Deyo, describing her as \\"inspiringly graceful.\\" He gave a sentence of light praise each to Helen Allyn, Sidney Deane, Sidney Bracey, Beatrice McKenzie, and Eddie Cunningham. His ultimate conclusion: \\"The Woggle-Bug, taken all in all, represents an earnest effort to provide an extravaganza free from objectionable feature. The music is an attractive virtue, and reawakens the hope that some day Composer Chapin will have a really good book to work with.\\"Burns Mantle. \\"The Woggle-Bug.\\" Inter Ocea, June 20, 1905.

Originally settled in 1825, the village -- originally named \\"Reesorville\\" (reference to the Reesors settlers) sometime after 1804 and also known as \\"Mannheim\\" (likely after Mannheim) -- was a founded by Mennonites from Upstate New York and Pennsylvania. Eventually, as Upper Canada started to experience immigration from the British Isles, Markham would also experience such growth from Britain. By 1825, the name \\"Markham\\" was established as the permanent name. In 1850, the police village is created, but it does not include the villages of Unionville and Thornhill (which would later join in 1971 when the Town of Markham is created). The village becomes a police village in 1931. Markham Village was located within York County, Ontario (Upper Canada until 1840 and Canada West until 1867). Population As of 2011, Census tract profile for 0400.07 (CT) currently has a population of 3397 compared to 3418 in 2006 (Census/NHS 2011, Census 2006). This decrease in population may have been due to issues affecting this area including the high costs of property or simply birth and death rates within the area. In addition, Markham's current economic expansions in both the public services (housing, construction, public services, etc.) and finances, it is forecast that Markham will see a population drop from those deciding to move away as a result of high priced real estate. It is currently estimated that a single family, detached home costs approximately one million Canadian dollars in Markham. Markham Village Community Centre Markham Village Community Centre is located on the southeast corner of Main Street Markham and Highway 7 (Side Road Allowance). It was the former site of the Markham Fair and (William Armstrong's and later Robert Goodfellow Armstrong's) Wellington Hotel. The community centre features a library (c. 1981 and renovated 2009), community rooms (above rink) and indoor ice rink (c. 1963 with rink seating for 450 originally for hockey and now home to skating club). and drop off recycling centre. The community centre is configured on a north-south axis, where as the old Agricultural Hall was east-west with much of it now occupied by the current day parking lot. Veterans Square and Cenotaph In the southwest corner of Markham Road and Highway 7 is the Markham Cenotaph. The area is used for annual Remembrance Day ceremonies. Built in 1981 by Phillip Carter, the current memorial was re- vamped (2017-2018) with a new Veterans Square and Cenotaph which features an obelisk-like cenotaph and dedicated to the men and women who fought for Canada's freedom. An earlier memorial by Rebecca Sisler (c. 1967) was moved indoors into the community centre in 1996. Main Street Markham Farmers‚Äô Market From early May to early October a farmers market is set up along Robinson Street just west of Main Street. The market features local products and live entertainment and runs every Saturday from 8am to 1pm from May to October. Education Markham Village is home to one of York Region's oldest schools. Opened as SS #17 in 1846 (later as SS #15), it became Markham Village Public School in 1886 and currently as Franklin Street Public School since early 1960s.

Bishop was the author of 13 books and dozens of magazine articles, and he edited the 1920 best-seller, Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs Letters to His Children. Childhood, family and education Bishop was born September 5, 1847 in Seekonk, Massachusetts, today the village of Rumford in East Providence, Rhode Island.Bishop, Chip. The Lion and the Journalist ‚Äì The Remarkable Friendship of Theodore Roosevelt and Joseph Bucklin Bishop. p. 21 He was the sixth of seven children of James Madison Bishop (1812‚Äì1864), a farmer, and Elzada Balcom Bishop (1808‚Äì1892), a homemaker. His ancestors were early New England settlers, arriving in Salem, Massachusetts from England in 1639. Bridget Bishop, his great grandmother via marriage, was the first woman executed during the Salem Witch Trials of the 1690s. Shortly after Bridget's death on June 10, 1692, the family escaped to Rehoboth, Massachusetts where many later generations of Bishops lived and worked. Joseph's great grandfather, Phanuel Bishop, a wealthy innkeeper in Rehoboth, led a company of Minutemen that marched on the alarm of the \\"shot heard ‚Äòround the world\\" at the Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts. Phanuel Bishop was a member of the United States Congress from Massachusetts (1799‚Äì1807) and a delegate to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1778 in Boston. Joseph grew up on his family farm, graduated from Pawtucket, Rhode Island High School in 1866 and from Brown University, with a Bachelor of Arts degree, in 1870. An early Providence Journal profile recorded that he was \\"a genial, companionable fellow\\" but \\"did not rank high in his class (of 53)... as a matter of fact he was not a brilliant scholar.\\" He supported himself through college by working on the editorial staff of the Providence Morning Herald, a short-lived Democratic voice in local politics. Joseph married Harriet Louisa Hartwell (1848‚Äì1917) in the Newman Congregational Church in Rehoboth, December 14, 1872. Raised on a New Hampshire farm, Harriet was the fourth of five children of Samuel Estabrook Hartwell and Lucy King Hartwell. She was orphaned at age 11 and sent to live with relatives, John and Harriet Hartwell in Providence. Harriet's great-great grandfather, Ephraim, owned a popular tavern in Concord, Massachusetts during the early days of the Revolution. Hartwell's Tavern is now an historic landmark, situated along Concord's Battle Road, and managed as a visitor attraction by the National Park Service. Early career Joseph Bucklin Bishop shortly after graduating from Brown University in 1870 At the time of his marriage, Bishop was working on the city staff of the venerable New York Tribune, edited by the legendary but eccentric Horace Greeley. It was, arguably, the nation's leading newspaper of the time. Bishop recorded that in spite of a shabby work environment on Printing House Square in lower Manhattan, the Tribune‚Äôs offices ‚Äúharbored a moral and intellectual spirit that I met nowhere else in my 35 years of journalistic experience.‚Äù After just six months, he was promoted to the paper's editorial staff where he came under the tutelage of a senior editor, John Milton Hay, former assistant secretary to President Abraham Lincoln and future United States Secretary of State under President Theodore Roosevelt. To supplement his meager income, Bishop moonlighted as an American correspondent for the London Daily News. His historically-significant dispatches included reports of the assassination of President James A. Garfield and the grand opening of the magnificent Brooklyn Bridge. Mid career In July 1883, Bishop departed the Tribune for Edwin Godkin‚Äôs New York Evening Post, ‚Äúthe home of absolute intellectual freedom, intellectual courage and intellectual honesty.‚Äù Bishop, Joseph Bucklin. Notes and Anecdotes of Many Years. New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons. 1925, p. 102. For more than a decade and a half, from the waning days of Reconstruction to the close of the Industrial Revolution, Bishop thrived professionally under Godkin's tutelage. He recalled his years there as ‚Äúthe most enjoyable and profitable‚Äù of his journalistic career. Bishop's advocacy led to the institutionalization of the paper's groundbreaking Voter's Guide (to counter Tammany Hall propaganda) and the adoption in New York of the novel Australian paper ballot by which voters selected candidates for office in private, on impartial, state-produced forms. His determined investigative research helped to uncover and publicize incriminating letters by James G. Blaine, the 1884 Republican presidential nominee. The so-called Mulligan Letters played a critical role in the candidate's eventual defeat.\\"The Lion and the Journalist\\", p. 56. Later on, Bishop helped Godkin publish a series of ‚Äúbiographies‚Äù of leading Tammany Hall figures that exposed their roles in crime and corruption in New York City Hall. Initial work with Theodore Roosevelt Bishop's association with Theodore Roosevelt began in the spring of 1895 when TR, as New York City Police Commission president, was radically reforming the corrupt and patronage-laden force. Roosevelt welcomed the editorial support he received from Bishop at the Evening Post, and they began a correspondence that would number more than 600 letters over 25 years. Early on, when Bishop's loyalty was questioned, Roosevelt put his journalist friend to a stern personal test, challenging his allegiance in an eyeballs-to-eyeballs confrontation. Bishop passed without flinching, and Roosevelt declared, ‚ÄúWhat I value in you is that you give me the advice you think I need rather than the advice you think I‚Äôd like to have.‚Äù Notes and Anecdotes p. 116 With the retirement of Godkin in 1899 and anti-Roosevelt sentiment rising among new Evening Post managers, Bishop joined an exodus of writers to the rival New York Commercial Advertiser (later the Globe and Commercial Advertiser) where he became chief of editorial writers. Working alongside editor John Henry Wright, Bishop helped evolve the scrawny weakling of a paper into a dignified, readable journal ‚Äì a clear alternative to the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù rags of William R. Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer. Bishop editorialized vigorously against a scheme by New York State power brokers to kick Governor Theodore Roosevelt ‚Äúupstairs‚Äù to the Vice Presidency on the William McKinley ticket. But when Roosevelt was nominated by the Republicans, Bishop fell into line, helping to strategize his New York general election campaign. When Roosevelt assumed the Presidency in 1901, on McKinley's assassination, Bishop editorialized, ‚ÄúNobody who has followed Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs public career or has had the privilege of personal acquaintance with him has any doubt about his ability to fill with honor to himself and usefulness to the country the high office upon which he has entered.‚Äù New York Commercial Advertiser. September 16, 1901. p. 6 =The Panama years= Bishop's strong editorial backing of Roosevelt's armed support of the 1903 Panamanian revolution and the subsequent construction of the Panama Canal, linking the Atlantic and Pacific, and his vigorous advocacy of Roosevelt's election as President in 1904, won him Roosevelt's nod to become executive secretary of the Isthmian Canal Commission in Washington, D.C. the following year. Bishop was tasked with managing the Commission's day-to-day matters but also with ensuring public support for the canal through press agentry and by keeping the project's official history. Bishop's promised $10,000 annual salary was relentlessly criticized by Roosevelt's opponents in Congress, mostly because it was twice what each of them made. Opposition newspapers joined in the criticism. When, in the summer of 1907, escalating allegations of cronyism surrounding Bishop's appointment threatened appropriations for Panama Canal construction, Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, surely with Roosevelt's quiet consent, ordered Bishop out of Washington to Panama where the partisan political heat would be less intense. ‚ÄúI accept your decision without reluctance,‚Äù Bishop informed Taft, ‚Äúand shall go to the Isthmus, not sadly but cheerfully.‚Äù The Lion and the Journalist, p. 222 It would not be his first trip to Panama. In the fall of the previous year, Bishop had gone ahead to advance Roosevelt's historic inspection tour, the first time a sitting president had journeyed outside the U.S. Joseph Bucklin Bishop would, except for month-long summer breaks, remain on the isthmus for seven years, serving clandestinely at first as Theodore Roosevelt's ‚Äúeyes and ears.‚Äù He reported back on the ‚Äúastonishing‚Äù progress that Army Corps of Engineers Colonel George Washington Goethals and his team were making, excavating the ‚Äúbig ditch‚Äù and building dams and locks. Before long, Bishop became Goethals's trusted aide, serving as his first line of defense against workers with complaints and grievances. But Bishop's greatest achievement in Panama would be as founding editor of The Canal Record, a weekly newspaper for the thousands of workers in Panama. His regular reports of cubic yards dug by rival work divisions, and the competitive baseball games they played created a spirit of healthy competition that lifted worker morale and productivity. The ‚Äúgood news‚Äù of The Canal Record also built vital public support on newspaper editorial pages back home and in the halls of the United States Congress where annual appropriations required to keep the canal project moving forward. Legacy Bishop departed Panama a few weeks before the official opening of the canal in August 1914 to resume his literary career in New York. His book, The Panama Gateway, a comprehensive history of the canal, won wide and favorable reviews. Bishop's contribution to the nation's war effort, at age 70, was in service as general manager, in charge of day-to-day administration of the American Society for the Relief of French War Orphans, a philanthropic organization based in New York. It was during Theodore Roosevelt's hospitalization in late 1918, near the end of his life, that Bishop disclosed that he wanted to publish examples of letters TR had written to his children when they were young. Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs Letters to his Children, released in 1919, became a national best seller and made Bishop economically self- sufficient for the remainder of his life.Edmund Morris, Colonel Roosevelt, (2010) pg 563, Shortly after Roosevelt's return from his near-death expedition to Brazil 1914 he startled Bishop by declaring, \\"I know what I wish you would do - write the story of my public life. You know it almost as well as I know it myself.\\" To ensure that Bishop had the resources to accurately tell the story, TR pledged, \\"I will turn all my official and private correspondence over to you for your exclusive control.\\".Bishop, Joseph Bucklin. Notes and Anecdotes of Many Years. p. 146. Events leading to World War I delayed the project until late 1918 when Roosevelt directed the Library of Congress to give Bishop full access to his papers. Bishop worked resolutely on the authorized biography, as told through Roosevelt's letters, previewing the early chapters with the subject himself. It wasn't until the fall of 1920 that the work was published in two volumes. The New York Times reviewer concluded that the book \\"has been carried to completion with... delicate discretion, with instinctive tact and a high courage which Roosevelt would be the first to recognize.\\".Bishop, Chip, \\"The Lion and the Journalist,\\" p. 291. Later, Edith Roosevelt would tell Bishop, \\"I do not wish to flatter, but who else could have done it?\\".Bishop, Chip. \\"The Lion and the Journalist,\\" p. 292. Death On December 17, 1928, 81-year-old Joseph Bucklin Bishop had finished the first four chapters of his biography of George Washington Goethals when he retired to his solitary room at the University Club of New York. Sometime during the early-morning hours of the 18th, he took gravely ill. He was found dead when he did not come down to breakfast. The official cause of death was Carditis. Following a service at the Church of the Incarnation (New York City) Bishop's remains were cremated, and he was laid to rest alongside his wife, Harriet, and two of his children, Alice and Hartwell, at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.Bishop, Chip. \\"The Lion and the Journalist,\\" p. 296. New biography on Bishop in 2011 A new book on Joseph Bucklin Bishop and his quarter- century friendship with Theodore Roosevelt was published in fall 2011. \\"The Lion and the Journalist,\\" was authored by Bishop's great-great nephew, Chip Bishop of Cape Cod. The book makes use of published and unpublished sources on Bishop's life including hundreds of letters exchanged with Roosevelt and materials from the Bishop family archives.

During construction it became known as the Leeds New Line and following nationalisation it was referred to as the Spen Line. Passenger services ceased in the 1950s with full closure in stages between 1960 and 1990. History An early casualty of the construction of the railway was Mirfield Cricket Club, who stated in the Report and Balance sheet of the Annual General Meeting held at the Black Bull Hotel on Wednesday 18 December 1895: Owing to the construction of the Heaton Lodge and Wortley Railway; it became necessary at the end of the season 1894, to select a new ground, lay a new cricket pitch, and erect a new pavilion.

Biography  Jules Fournier was born on August 23, 1884, to parents Isa√Øe Fournier and Marie Durocher in Coteau-du-Lac, Quebec. His family was not wealthy, and Fournier attended a local parish school, where he was taught basic Latin. In 1897, Fournier entered the second form at Coll√®ge de Valleyfield in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. He was an exceptional student, and was described by one of his teachers as advanced beyond his fellow students and the majority of his instructors. Following a verbal encounter with his school principal, Fournier was expelled from Coll√®ge de Valleyfield in December 1902. In 1903, Fournier joined the La Presse newspaper in Montreal, where he met the prominent Quebec nationalist Olivar Asselin. In 1904, Fournier moved to the Le Canada newspaper. In his position there, he travelled around New England investigating the lifestyles and affairs of Franco- Americans. In 1906, Fournier was made a political reporter at Le Canada, but began writing for Asselin's Le Nationaliste publication under the name Pierre Beaudry the same year. Fournier became Le Nationaliste's editor in 1908. Between 1907 and 1909, Fournier ran into legal trouble on several occasions as a result of his provocative journalism. In 1907, Quebec government Minister Ad√©lard Turgeon took him to court, as did the then-future Premier of Quebec Louis-Alexandre Taschereau in 1909. Also in 1909, Fournier criticised the decisions being made by Quebec courts (calling them a \\"prostitution of justice\\"), as well as described three former politicians as \\"erstwhile thugs\\". Attorney General Lomer Gouin proceeded to charge Fournier with contempt of court. The judge in his case was none other than one of the men Fournier had disparaged, Judge Fran√ßois Langelier. Langelier sentenced Fournier to three months in prison, although he only served seventeen days. During this time, Fournier wrote a book, Souvenirs de prison, about his experiences in prison and the unsanitary conditions there. In 1910, Fournier worked at Le Devoir for three months before travelling to France as a correspondent for La Patrie. Fournier formed his own weekly newspaper L‚ÄôAction in April 1911, featuring contributions by his friend Asselin as well as Arthur Beauchesne, a parliamentary expert and National Historic Person of Canada, several writers and many poets. The paper was sued twice during its existence - once by the editor of Fournier's former employer, La Patrie, and once by the Mayor of Montreal for calling him a 'big thief', the latter of which Fournier won. These lawsuits during the paper's infancy led Fournier to joke that the paper should have been called L‚ÄôAction pour libelle (\\"libel lawsuit\\"). After a three-month stint on the Montreal municipal council in 1916, Fournier's paper closed down on 29 April of that year. In 1917, Fournier began work as a translator for the Senate of Canada. However, in April 1918, Fournier developed an early case of the Spanish flu and died on April 16 in Ottawa, Ontario. He was 33 years of age, and was quoted by his wife as saying that he was \\"too young\\" to die. He was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

Relations between the two countries go back to 1887, when representatives of the Congo Free State established contacts with the court of the Qing dynasty then ruling China. The first treaty between the two powers was signed in 1898. The Free State became a Belgian colony in 1908, but when it gained its independence in 1960 it established formal relations with the Republic of China (ROC), which had replaced the Qing in 1912 but was relegated to the island of Taiwan after 1949. Over the next decade, Congolese recognition was switched several times between the ROC and the PRC before it settled finally on the latter in 1971. At the time, the Congo was known as Zaire. In the 21st century, Chinese investment in the DRC and Congolese exports to China have grown rapidly. Qing relations with the Congo Free State In 1887, King Leopold II of Belgium sent emissaries to the Qing court in China to request the right to recruit labourers for the Congo Free State. Since the Qing had already signed a treaty with Belgium, the Belgians were permitted to recruit labour on behalf of their own colonies, but not for the Congo Free State, which was not a Belgian colony. In 1892, the agents of the Congo Free State contracted out their recruiting in China to Macau-based Portuguese firms. A total of 536 men and six boys were recruited in Guangzhou under three-year contracts. The Congo paid their round-trip fares, provided room and board and paid wages of 45 francs a month. Workers wishing to remain in the Congo after three years would then receive a 400-franc cash allowance. These men left for the Congo on 18 September 1892 aboard the German steamer Walstein from Macau. Both the China Custom Annual Trading and Commerce Records and the Business Report of the British Consulate in China reported more workers recruited by Macanese and Hong Kong agents in Qiongzhou and Shantou for work in the Congo in 1892. In the Congo, these recruits were put to work on the Congo railway, logging trees and hauling rocks. Most of these recruits died in the harsh conditions of the Congo. Contemporary newspapers in Hong Kong published information about the bad conditions and mistreatment suffered by the Chinese in the Congo.Li Anshan, A History of Overseas Chinese in Africa to 1911 (Diasporic Africa Press, 2012), 76‚Äì77. During this first period of recruitment, around 1,000 Chinese went to the Congo.Anshan (2012), 89. On 10 July 1898, China and the Congo Free State signed a \\"special chapter\\" in Peking that stated, in part: \\"It was agreed upon that Chinese citizens can at will move to and live in the Congo Free State. All properties, movable or unmovable, can be purchased or traded. Whether for shipping, business, crafts or arts, Chinese citizens will receive the same treatment as citizens of the most favorable countries.\\" This agreement granted China \\"most favoured nation\\" status in the Congo. It also had the effect of legalising the recruitment of Chinese for work in the Congo. Although Congolese authorities found the performance of the workers of 1892 unsatisfactory, recruitment drives were undertaken in China in 1901, 1902, 1904, and 1906. During this second period of recruitment, about 2,000 Chinese went to the Congo. In 1906, Hong Kong alone produced 500 recruits.Anshan (2012), 91. Establishing relations with the ROC and PRC A mass rally in Tiananmen Square of Beijing in 1965 against U.S. intervention in Congo-L√©opoldville. In October 1960, the newly independent DRC, then called the Republic of the Congo, established diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (ROC).http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/focac/183553.htm China.Org.Cn website where it says \\"In October [1960], the Congolese Kasavubu government \\"established diplomatic relations\\" with the Taiwan Authority.\\" The DRC changed recognition in February 1961 to the People's Republic of China (PRC), changing back again to recognise the ROC later the same year in September. Relations were again established between the DRC, then known as the Republic of Zaire, and the People's Republic of China in November 1972 and have remained intact since. During the time that the DRC/Zaire recognised Taiwan, between 1961 and 1971, the PRC supported and provided material support to anti-Zairian rebels. After Zaire's president, Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu, reverted recognition back to the PRC eight Chinese leaders visited Zaire between 1978 and 1995. Mobutu himself visited the PRC five times despite the fact that their relationship was not very close at the time. Present economic relations In June 2000, a Sino-Congolese telecommunications company (China-Congo Telecom) was set up between ZTE and the Congolese government in a deal worth RMB80 million in concessional finance from China EXIM Bank. In April 2009, South African telecommunications group MTN Group offered to buy ZTE's 51 percent stake in the company for US$200 million. As of January 2010, the DRC has not yet been given Approved Destination Status (ADS) by China due to ongoing civil conflict in the country. Trade between China and the DRC greatly increased between 2002 and 2008. This is largely due to massive growth in the DRC's exports of raw materials to China. In 2007, the DRC exported US$304.8 million worth of cobalt. In 2008, the DRC exported US$1.13 billion of cobalt to China. Exports of copper ore and hard woods to China also increased greatly. =Sicomines= A deal was struck between Sicomines, a consortium of Chinese companies (Sinohydro and China Railway Engineering Corporation), and the Congolese government in April 2008 to grant mineral concessions in Katanga province in exchange for infrastructure investments. In a deal originally worth US$9 billion and funded by China EXIM Bank, US$6 billion would go to infrastructure development and US$3 billion being invested in mining operations in Katanga. 68% of the project would be owned by Sicomines and the remaining 32% would be owned by Congo's mining parastatal G√©camines. The US$6 billion was originally to have been invested in a total of 6,600 km of road would be either built or rehabilitated, two hospitals and two universities being built. The mining concessions in Dima (Dikuluwe) and Mashamba West would have given Sicomines access to 10.6 million tons of copper and over 600,000 tons of cobalt, with 6.8 million tons of copper and 427,000 tons of cobalt being confirmed deposits. The mine will come online at the earliest in 2013. Critics of the project have alleged that the deal undervalues the mineral deposits in Katanga. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about this deal negatively affecting the DRC's ability to sustain its debt. This is because the deal would disqualify the country from the IMF's foreign debt relief program run under the auspices of the World Bank Group‚Äôs Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program, as the DRC would be getting its debt canceled only to be taking on even more new debts. The IMF has argued that in order for the DRC to remain eligible and the deal to go through the value of the Sicomines deal would have to be greatly reduced. In May 2009, the Congolese government agreed to put on hold US$3 billion of the deal while a feasibility study for the mineral concessions is finalized. As of October 2017, \\"Sinohydro Corp. and China Railway Construction...own 68 percent of Sicomines,\\" with the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo originally telling the Chinese companies to \\"stop exporting unprocessed copper and cobalt and refine all its metals within the country\\" and later reversing their decision.William Clowes, \\"Congo Halts Sicomines Copper Exports, Orders Local Processing,\\"American Journal of Transportation, Oct 2017.Tom Wilson, \\"Kinshasa, Chinese partners near deal for $660 million power plant: DR Congo rising? ,\\" Mail and Guardian, Oct 15, 2015.Aaron Ross, \\"Congo orders China joint venture to stop exporting raw metals,\\"Reuters, Oct 9, 2017.Reuters Staff, \\"Congo lifts ban on raw metal exports by Chinese joint venture,\\" Reuters, Oct 11, 2017. =Benefaction= The governor of Katanga province Moise Katumbi, province estimates that over 60 of the province's 75 processing plants, around 90%, are owned by Chinese nationals. Most of these operations are privately owned limited liability companies owned by Chinese nationals. They are known to have poor environmental and labour relations records and have been accused, directly or indirectly, of using child labour. In 2007, about 600 Chinese nationals were expelled from Katanga for violating labour and environmental laws. =Building projects in the DRC= Since 1972, the PRC has given a number of donations to the DRC. Including a farm on the outskirts of Kinshasa, a sugar refinery in Kisangani, and the National Assembly building (at the time costing US$42 million or US$186 million in 2011 dollarsMeasuring Worth, Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount - Consumer Price Index, retrieved on the 24/01/2011) were all built and given to the DRC/Zaire in the 1970s. The Chinese government also built an 80,000 seat stadium in 1994. In 2004, the PRC built and donated the N'Djili Sino-Congolese Friendship Hospital, handing it over to the DRC government in 2006. According to AidData, from 2000 to 2011, there are approximately 21 Chinese official development finance projects identified in DRC through various media reports.Austin Strange, Bradley C. Parks, Michael J. Tierney, Andreas Fuchs, Axel Dreher, and Vijaya Ramachandran. 2013. China‚Äôs Development Finance to Africa: A Media- Based Approach to Data Collection. CGD Working Paper 323.

Besides providing military equipment, Chinese firms helped construct the FARDC headquarters and a naval base at the sea port of Banana. The Chinese have also provided maintenance and repair for the Congolese navy's \\"Shanghai\\" Type 062 gunboats, since eight boats were purchased under the Mobutu regime, but only two being currently operational due to poor maintenance. A Chinese military mission is based at Kamina since 2008, where in August 2017 they completed training of the Congolese 32nd Rapid Reaction Brigade by Chinese instructors.Wondo, Jean-Jacques (23 May 2018).

In 1948, the company bought a local syrup manufacturer and Dixieland Syrups soon had wide distribution throughout Texas grocery stores. Four years later, Renfro acquired the formulas of Gold Star Foods and reworked the ingredients to make them taste more like family recipes. Before long, the company entered the jelly, preserve, vinegar and chow-chow business as well. By 1963, company sales had more than quadrupled. In 1972, shortly after incorporating under its current name, Renfro Foods, Inc., the family purchased the recipes of Ol√© Foods, a Mexican-style hot sauce maker. They re-worked the basic taco sauce ingredients of Ol√© Foods, and created a richer and tastier salsa recipe. Following George's death in 1975, Arthurine and sons, Bill and Jack, led the company's expansion into mild sauces and a variety of picantes and medium-style sauces.  Products  In 1995, Renfro Foods introduced two gourmet salsas: Black Bean and Habanero. In 1997, Peach, Chipotle Corn and Roasted salsas were added. Garlic salsa joined the product line-up in 2001. At the same time, Renfro Foods began labeling in French and Spanish to increase its global presence with product distribution in new international markets.

They are frequently referred to as the originators of the modern mainland Chinese hip-hop movement and are recognized for releasing the first Chinese hip-hop album that has met with any critical acclaim.http://www.hudong.com/wiki/ÂòªÂìàÊÄ™‰∫∫ Over the years Yin Ts‚Äôang has done commercial collaborations with Nike, Adidas, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), Myspace, Casio and Philips.http://www.hudong.com/wiki/ÈöêËóèÁªÑÂêà They have toured China, performing in 100 person performance houses in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region and 30,000 person capacity stadiums at the base of Wu-Tang Mountain. They have not only had the pleasure of working with Chinese artists like Supergirl Chris Lee (ÊùéÂÆáÊò•) and rock legend Cui Jian (Â¥îÂÅ•) but have also graced the stage with foreign legends like DJ Q-Bert, Kid Koala, Onyx and Mobb Deep. Yin Ts‚Äôang has won back to back achievement awards at the 1st and 2nd Annual Chinese Hip-Hop Awards for Best Group and Most Dedicated to the Art and was awarded Best Rap Group in China at the 2009 Kappa-YoHo Pop Music awards. Origins and development Yin Ts‚Äôang was founded late in the year 2000 in Beijing, China by local b-boy ÁéãÊ≥¢, W√°ng B≈ç (MC Webber), and Jeremy Michael Johnston (ËÄÅÈÉëXIV), a DJ and producer originally from Montgomery, Alabama. They were joined in 2001 by Josh Heffernan (Dirty Heff), an intellectual lyricist from Chicago, Illinois, and Marcus Zhong (Sbazzo), a rapper and producer from Toronto, Canada. The four members immediately clicked and began making music together in a small apartment in Beijing. In 2002, after having recorded more than 50 demo tracks, the group signed with local record label (Scream Records ÂöéÂè´) and went directly to the studio to begin recording. Soon after they released their first full-length studio album in Mandarin Chinese, Serve The People (‰∏∫‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊúçÂä°)(2003), which was co-produced and engineered by Mel \\"Herbie\\" Kent. The lead single off Serve the People, ‚ÄúWelcome to Beijing‚Äù an upbeat commercial anthem about Beijing which contained a catchy loop played on the local Erhu fiddle, reached a #11 spot nationally and secured the group a nomination for Best New Rock-Rap Group at the Pepsi Music Awards and the award for Best New Group of 2003 at the China National Radio Music Awards. The album also contains arguably the first Mandarin Jungle genre track \\"Speak\\" (DJ Herbie UK Remix) which along with ‚ÄúWelcome to Beijing‚Äù has been featured on BBC Radio 1Xtra. In 2005, fed up with the censorship and corruption within the music industry, Yin Ts‚Äôang decided not to renew their contract with Scream Records and instead chose to release material independently via the internet, and at local venues and shops. To continue promoting local hip-hop the members of Yin ts‚Äôang, along with the Beijing run Society Skateboards, began a monthly event called Section 6 which focused on promoting the pillars of hip-hop culture in numerous Beijing nightclubs. Section 6, still happening regularly, is now the longest running grassroots hip-hop party in Beijing. Yin Ts‚Äôang was reduced to a duo in 2006 when Heff returned to the USA to pursue higher education and MC Webber left the group due to creative differences to later form the band ‚ÄúBeijing Hip-Hop Experience‚Äù. ËÄÅÈÉëXIV and Sbazzo, released the group's 2nd studio album, Fast Lane (Ëä±Â§©ÈÖíÂú∞), after the breakup in 2007 through Kirin Kid Productions (È∫íÈ∫üÁ´•). Due to a lack of budget and poor media promotion, the album met with limited success. After legal action and a disgruntled break up between the artists and label management Yin Ts‚Äôang was released from their contract and once again returned to being independent free-agents. 2007 also saw the rise of the group's website, yintsang.com (a.k.a. shiftcn.com) which was run in part by ËÄÅÈÉëXIV. The website and its local following was acquired by Sedgwick Media Group Asia in 2008, merged into their international online hip-hop community which included www.hiphop.ch and www.sixshot.com and renamed www.hiphop.cn with headquarters located in Shanghai. The Chinese website was first downsized in 2008 and then later closed along with all their other portals after declaring bankruptcy in 2009. In 2009 ËÄÅÈÉëXIV along with Swiss-Chinese Battle Rapper and longtime collaborator Young Kin (born Andreas Yi-Jun Hwang) and China National Radio DJ, Lone Tian founded the label Yin Entertainment which was aimed at promoting local and international hip-hop acts in China.

The 44th Taiga Drama, the original work is by Miyao Tomiko, screenplay by Kaneko Narito and starring Hideaki Takizawa. Plot In the Heiji Rebellion, Taira no Kiyomori defeats Minamoto no Yoshitomo. Yoshitomo flees the battle but is betrayed by his own vassal and killed in Owari province. Yoritomo (one of Yoshitomo's sons) is captured, but Kiyomori decides to spare him and banishes him to Izu. Yoshitomo's beloved concubine Tokiwa Gozen flees to Kyoto with their three children. After learning that Kiyomori has arrested her own mother, Tokiwa goes to him to plead for mercy. Kiyomori spares the lives of the children, sending the older two to temples, and brings the youngest boy, Ushiwaka, and Tokiwa into his household. Treating him as his own child, Kiyomori receives criticism of his generous behavior towards Ushiwaka, the son of his enemy. Soon, he sends Ushiwaka to the Kurama temple where he is renamed Shanao. Shanao frequently escapes the temple at night, and this behavior makes it clear that he will not enter the priesthood. After learning the true identity of his father, of his Genji lineage, and of Kiyomori's plans to move against him he bids his mother farewell and travels northeast to Oshu. While Kiyomori starts to build a dream city and international port in Fukuhara, he also starts to work his way into the Imperial Court, eventually marrying his daughter Tokiko to the Emperor. With this new power the Heike grow fierce and unpopular with the court and people of Kyoto. Shanao, now named Yoshitsune after his rite of manhood, is living under the guardianship of Fujiwara no Hidehira and decides to join his exiled older brother Minamoto no Yoritomo and throws himself into the feud between the Heike and Genji.

Accident It was snowing and the airfield at Croydon was covered in dark snow clouds when at 11:40 the Spencer Airways Dakota attempted to depart bound for Salisbury in Rhodesia. The C-47A had just lifted from the runway at Croydon when the starboard wing dropped, then the aircraft turned to the left and the port wing dropped. The pilot was seen to apply full starboard aileron but the bank angle increased to 40 degrees with the port wing tip only a few feet from the ground. As the aircraft reached the perimeter track of the airfield, the aircraft levelled and then swung to the right. The aircraft bounced on the ground and crashed head-on into a parked CSA Douglas C-47, registrarion OK-WDB; both aircraft caught fire, and were subsequently destroyed. Eleven of the 18 passengers and one of the five crew died. Seven of the 11 survivors were taken to Croydon General Hospital but only two had to stay for further treatment. Two mechanics who were working on the CSA aircraft escaped without injury. The Ministry of Civil Aviation instituted \\"an inspection of Certificates of Airworthiness, Certificates of Safety and crew licences\\" at airfields under their control to ensure these documents were in order.Flight 17 July 1947 p67 The aircraft did not have a C of A, nor a valid Certificate of Safety, and no member of crew held a Navigators licence nor a licence to sign a Certificate of Safety.Flight 17 July 1947 p49 Investigation A coroners inquest was opened at Croydon on 29 January 1947 into the twelve deaths. It was determined that all but three of the deaths were caused by asphyxia from the inhalation of smoke and flames. One of the male passengers died from a severe blow to the head, another from a cerebral haemorrhage. The pilot and owner of the aircraft Edward Spencer died from carbon monoxide poisoning. After an account by the aircraft's engineer the inquest was postponed until 18 February. The inquest resumed with evidence from the co-pilot and witnesses on the ground, the jury returned a verdict of misadventure. Following the completion of the coroners court the Chief Inspector of Accidents opened an enquiry on 24 February. Evidence was taken from the surviving passengers and crew and baggage loaders. The co-pilot explained that the aircraft had just been delivered from the United States to Heathrow Airport following the purchase by Spencer. It had been ferried to Croydon the day before the accident and the long-range fuel tanks had been removed and the seats fitted. Preparing the aircraft had taken all day and night and Spencer was said to have had only two hours sleep. In the morning the starboard engine had a lack of pressure but the co-pilot and the radio operator said before the flight that it was OK. Another witness gave evidence that the wings were covered in snow and he had not seen any attempt to defrost the aircraft. A statement given by an inspector of police from Northern Rhodesia attested to the fact that Spencer did not smoke or drink and had many hours flying experience since the early 1930s. Following the statement about Spencer's lack of sleep the counsel representing the next-of-kin of Captain Spencer made a formal protest that they had not been able to question the statement. The inquiry was closed on 28 February following technical evidence and a statement from an aircraft engineer who had witnessed that the starboard engine had been in \\"a bad state\\" and was popping and spluttering before the aircraft had taken off. Cause The accident was determined to be the result of loss of control by the pilot while attempting to take-off in a heavily loaded aircraft in poor visibility attributed to \\"an error of flying technique by a pilot who lacked Dakota experience\\".Flight p49 Other factors may have been snow and frost of the wings and fatigue of the pilot.

He also practiced iris diagnosis (iridology) and is considered the co-father of combination homeopathic remedies.. Instead of administering single remedies over a long period, he thought it better to prescribe a combination of different, carefully composed single remedies. Felke became, so to speak, the inventor of the combination remedies which are being offered in great numbers by many companies today.  Biography  Because his treatments included applications of clay and clay baths, Felke was often referred to as the clay pastor. Felke's regimen included a healthy diet and outdoor exercise. His patients were given meals that contained little meat, healing earth applications and cold baths in outdoor zinc bathtubs, and they had to sleep on clay floors or straw sacks in cabins open to the light and air. Pastor Felke in Repelen in front of the Linden Hotel Felke, the son of a teacher and a minister's daughter, became interested in medical issues while he was studying theology and he attended medical lectures for several semesters. He had always been interested in medicinal plants, as well as in the well-known natural healers Hahnemann (the originator of homeopathy) and Priessnitz (hydrotherapy). At his first rectorate in Cronenberg he treated patients with homeopathic remedies during a diphtheria epidemic and was regarded by his patients. In 1894, he began his ministration as pastor at the Protestant village church in Repelen. In 1896, several residents established a homeopathic society in Repelen to support Felke's work because in most cases he dispensed the homeopathic remedies free of charge. Felke is considered the co-father of combination homeopathic remedies because he, deviating from Hahnemann's teachings, began to combine different active substances to treat chronic diseases. In 1897, Felke and several town representatives traveled to the Harz Mountains where Adolf Just, another well-known natural medicine practitioner of the time, had recently founded a \\"Jungborn\\", or health resort, in Eckertal, to see this resort. The visit no doubt left such a strong impression that it was decided to create a similar spa in Repelen. A large tract of grassland and farmland on Repelen Lake, not far from the village church, was purchased for 50,000 gold marks (today just under EUR 250,000) and the spa grounds were laid out with considerable personal effort. Fifty open-air cabins were added as accommodations for 100 to 120 people, and pavilions were set up as relaxing and lounging spaces. The Jungborn grounds, still one of the most popular parks in Moers, were dedicated in 1898. Because both the bath applications and the sports and calisthenics were performed unclothed, there were two bathing parks surrounded by stockade fences, one for men and one for women. Felke built up a flourishing spa business, first in Repelen and then in Bad Sobernheim. Although initially it was assumed that the original size of the resort was more than generous, in the season from May to October there up to 400 spa guests in Repelen, so many of them had to be lodged at private boarding houses. Many of the spa guests came from far away, including from the United States, England and Russia. This provided an enormous economic boost for the town and in particular for the hotel industry. In 1914, the Jungborn hotel was built. However, this new movement, unusual as it was for the rural population, was also highly criticized. Because the spa guests were naked during treatments, Felke was accused of endangering morals, a charge which he vehemently defended himself against. When a requirement to increase the height of the surrounding fences to three meters was not met quickly enough, the park was closed for a short time in 1899. Church authorities also viewed Felke's activities as suspect. When inquiries were made, though, the congregation never failed to confirm that Felke always also fulfilled his pastoral duties. These criticisms did not prevent a full-fledged Felke movement from forming. By 1914, Felke spas had been established in Berlin, Aachen, Krefeld, Kettwig, Dortmund, and Stettin. These institutions were not allowed to use the name Repelen method or Felke method unless they received confirmation from Felke that they had been trained and authorized by him. During this time a number of Felke societies were formed in Germany, totaling more than 2,500 members. A Felke journal was also published at this time. Pastor Felke in his medical office in Repelen When World War I broke out, development was abruptly stopped. The spa facilities were used as a military hospital. Added to this was the fact that in 1912 Felke had to give up his rectory because of infidelity and now had no income at all because even after doing this he continued to provide his homeopathic treatments free of charge. So Felke moved to Sobernheim in 1915 to stay with one of his students and there he built up a thriving spa once again. After the war, even though Felke went to Repelen every 14 days, business at the spa there never returned to the original levels it had once had. As a result, the spa closed; the Jungborn Society ended up selling the hotel to an innkeeper, and in 1934 it ceased all activities. Felke was active in Sobernheim until his death and he was a big part of the reason why this town on the Nahe River became a successful spa destination. This is why a monument was erected in his honor there, he was made an honorary resident, and there is a Felke museum. Work =Iridology = Felke was known for his practice of iridology. While the technique was a readily accepted method of diagnosis by many physicians, many others shunned it. Felke was accused of causing bodily harm in a total of 16 lawsuits and in the last case he was even accused of manslaughter, but he was always acquitted. In the last trial, which took place in 1909, Felke had to, in front of number of doctors‚Äîincluding some very prominent ones, such as the surgeon and privy councilor Garre‚Äîdiagnose 20 patients only by looking at their irises. Felke protested because talking to the patients, which he usually did to take their medical histories, was not permitted. The normal process of interrogation by the therapist of the patient as a human being who able to relate his feelings and physical ailments was shunned by dorcotrs. How many diagnoses were correct is not known, but he was able to convince the judges. =The Felke cure = The Felke cure has the following basic elements: # Felke sitz-bath # Light- and-air bath # Clay bath # Ground sleeping (lying down on and sleeping on the ground at night) The applications were supplemented by a nearly meat-free diet with a plenty of vegetables, unripe spelt, potatoes and fruit, with which Felke hoped to detoxify the body through undernourishment. For some patients Felke prescribed different diets, depending on their diagnoses. In 1992, a barefoot walk that was inspired by Felke's ideas was created in Bad Sobernheim. This 3.5 km loop has different stations, such as natural stones, gravel, wood, mud pools, water, balancing stations and grassy areas, to activate the senses, the foot's reflex zones, and the musculoskeletal system. There are still a number of Felke societies today. Bad Sobernheim continues to be a center of Felke cures with three health resorts, with another one in Diez on the Lahn and one in Meddersheim (close to Bad Sobernheim). Both clay cures and iridology have become an established part of the practice of naturopathy in the early 21st century. The Felke Institute for Iridology was established in 1984. There is also a Medical Working Group for Felke Therapy with offices in Bad Sobernheim and a manufacturer of combination homeopathic remedies, Hevert-Arzneimittel GmbH & Co. KG. Like Kneipp, Preissnitz, Rikli, Kuhne and Just, Felke is one of a number of influential lay practitioners who played major roles in developing naturopathy in the early 20th century. Even so, Felke never made a secret of the fact that he did not consider himself the inventor of a new treatment. \\"Homeopathy is what won me over with its simplicity and uniformity. It is the backbone of my entire method‚Ä¶\\" While Pastor Felke initially prescribed mostly single homeopathic remedies, later on he created his combination homeopathic remedies based on his practical experiences. He used these remedies almost exclusively in the last 10 years, acting on the principle that a treatment would work the fastest if the \\"complex diseases\\" present in most patients were countered with a \\"complex remedy.\\" Notes References Wolfgang Schulz: Die Felke-Kur, S+M Verlag, Bad Kreuznach, 2. ed. 1996 * J√ºrgen Westphal: Kuren nach Felke mit den Elementen der Natur.

We can say that Montfort and Strickland's poetics privileges neither the sea nor the spar but the between.\\" Reviewing Zone : Zero, Djelloul Marbrook wrote, \\"For exploring the outer spaces of poetry Zone : Zero is practically a handbook. Placement is everything here. ... recalling as it does the profound commitment of so many medieval Arab, Berber and Jewish poets to mathematics and science.

Stephanie Strickland's Zone : Zero enacts and constitutes this shift.\\" In an essay citing slippingglimpse an example of socially distributed cognition, N.

They remain words and phonemes beholden to English syntax, yes, but they also become part of a larger natural sign system, one water currents and chreodic patterns, algorithms and data flows.\\" In \\"Iteration, you see: Floating Text and Chaotic Reading/Viewing in slippingglimpse,\\" Gwen Le Cor writes, \\"...by shedding the solidity of stable written text and presenting a liquid text in motion, slippingglimpse is also asking us to loosen our metaphors of writing, and discard the solidity that weaving metaphors imply. Text is no longer textile, it is texture, and in this particular case it is liquid texture.\\" In reviewing V: Wave.Son.Nets/Losing L'Una, Edward Falco described Strickland as, \\"urging readers to listen carefully, with body as well as mind, to see through the constructs the mind establishes to see into the world, to see what may be beyond mind, what the mind is not wired to see; and most of all to resist the static and hierarchical while accepting the fluid and enmeshed. In this sense, Strickland, like Dickinson before her, is a deeply spiritual poet, and one who, incidentally, is genuinely exploring the possibilities of digital writing to reshape the conventions of literature.\\" Writing for The Iowa Review Web, Jaishree Odin analyzed The Ballad of Sand and Harry Soot as follows: \\"Thematically, The Ballad is about unrequited love between Sand and Soot; at another level, it is about the art of navigation through multiple discourses that constitute human experience. In some ways, it also alludes to the computer-generated electronic spaces and humans who interact with these spaces. The sophisticated conception and design of this hypermedia work brings together a variety of discourses from art, science, mathematics, philosophy, and even mythology to create a weave of texts.\\" In Contemporary Women's Writing, Sally Evans wrote of The Ballad of Sand and Harry Soot, \\"...Sand as a figure of cyberfemininity is frequently described in ways that trouble the clear boundaries between the organic and electronic selves ... Significantly, Sand‚Äôs hybridity also makes her excessive, a self beyond the neat categorizations of human or machine. She is a point of articulation between organic and inorganic matter, and her contact with Harry Soot serves to entangle further human qualities such as frailty and emotion with the supposedly infallible electronic world.\\"Evans, Sally. \\"The Patchwork Girl‚Äôs Daughters: Cyberfemininity, Hybridity, and Excess in the Poetry of Stephanie Strickland and Mez Breeze.\\" Contemporary Women's Writing, January 2016. Oxford University Press. Joseph Tabbi has written on True North, in Cognitive Fictions and electronic book review: \\"Strickland's poetics of indirect citation, annotation, and recombination creates affinities with a distinctive (and mostly American) tradition that reaches back through Dickinson to Jonathan Edwards. Her willingness to court abstraction and a minimalist language (at the risk of occasional unreadability) opens what should be a fruitful conversation with the Language Poets, while the recognition awarded True North by the judges for the Sandeen Prize ensures that her work will be welcomed into the domestic spaces of contemporary social realism no less than the more public-minded collectivities represented at meetings of the Modern Language Association and the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts (where Strickland has given readings).\\" Originally written in Catalan, the detailed study Poes√≠a Digital: Deena Larsen y Stephanie Strickland by Oreto Dom√©nech i Masi√† was published in a Spanish translation by the University of Valencia in 2015.

It is the cost accountant's job to trace these costs back to a certain product or process (cost object) during production. Some costs cannot be traced back to a single cost object. Some costs benefit more than one product or process in the manufacturing process. These costs are called Joint cost. Almost all manufacturers incur joint costs at some level the manufacturing process.Lanen, W. N., Anderson, S., Maher, M. W. (2008). Fundamentals of Cost Accounting, McGraw Hill, It can also be defined as the cost to operate joint-product processes including the disposal of waste.Wouters, Mark; Selto, Frank H.; Hilton, Ronald W.; Maher, Michael W. (2012): Cost Management: Strategies for Business Decisions, International Edition, Berkshire (UK), p. 532. With regard to joint costs, it is essential to allocate the joint cost for the different joint products for determining individual product costs. Several methods are used to allocate joint cost. These methods are mainly classified onto engineering and non-engineering methods. Non engineering methods are mainly based on the market share of the product; the higher market share, the higher proportion assigned to it e.g. net realizable value. In this method, the proportions are determined based on the sales value proportions. In the engineering based method, proportions are found based on physical quantities and measurements such as volume, weight, etc.  References Category:Costs ","title":"Joint cost"},{"id":"30612186","text":"Abdelhamid Slama (born October 23, 1941) is a Tunisian politician.

He is particularly known for his work in the spontaneous appearance of order in convection, slime molds and chemotaxis. Biography Lee Segel was born in 1932 in Newton, Massachusetts to Minna Segel, an art teacher, and Louis Segel, a partner in the Oppenheim-Segel tailors. Louis Segel was something of an intellectual as could be seen in his house from, e.g., the Kollwitz and Beckman prints and the Shakespeare and Co. edition of 'Ulysses', all purchased in Europe in the 1930s. Both parents were of Jewish-Lithuanian origin, of families that immigrated to Boston near the end of the 19th century. The seeds of Segel's later huge vocabulary could partly be seen to stem from his father's reading (and acting on) a claim that the main effect of a prep school was on the vocabulary of its graduates. Segel graduated from Harvard in 1953, majoring in mathematics. Thinking he might want to go into the brand-new field of computers, he started graduate studies in MIT, where he concentrated on applied mathematics instead. In 1959 he married Ruth Galinski, a lawyer and a distant cousin, in her native London, where they spent the first two years of their wedded life. Later 4 children were born (Joel '61, Susan '62, Daniel '64 and Michael '66), and still later, 18 grandchildren. In 1973 the family moved to Rehovot, Israel. He died in 2005. Career Lee Segel received a PhD from MIT in 1959, under the supervision of C. C. Lin. In 1960, he joined the Applied Mathematics faculty at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In 1970 he spent a sabbatical at Cornell Medical School and the Sloan-Kettering Institute. Segel moved from RPI to the Weizmann Institute in 1973, where he became the chairman of the Applied Mathematics department, and later dean of the Faculty of Mathematical Sciences and chair of the Scientific Council. At Los Alamos National Laboratory he was a summer consultant to the theoretical biology group from 1984 to 1999, and he was named Ulam Visiting Scholar for 1992-93. Hydrodynamics Rayleigh-B√©nard Convection In 1967 Segel and Scanlon were the first to analyze a non-linear convection problem. Segel's most quoted paper in this field was his last work in this field; it was published in parallel with the work of Newell and Whitehead. These papers gave an explanation of the seemingly spontaneous appearance of patterns - rolls or honeycomb cells - in liquid sufficiently heated from below (B√©nard convection patterns). (Preceding this was the Turing pattern formation, proposed in 1952 by Alan Turing to describe chemical patterns.) Technically the tool was that of deriving \\"amplitude\\" equations from the full Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, simplified equations describing the evolution of a slowly changing wave amplitude of the roiling liquid; this amplitude equation was later described as the Newell‚ÄìWhitehead‚ÄìSegel equation. Patterns Slime Mold (Mycetozoa Protozo) With Evelyn Keller he developed a model for slime mold (Dictyostelium discoideum) chemotaxis that was perhaps the first example of what was later called an \\"emergent system\\"; e.g. in Steven Johnson's 2001 book Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software . Dictyostelium is 'the main character'. Its amoebas join together into a single multicellular aggregate (akin to a multicellular organism) if food runs out; the multicellular aggregate has a better chance to find optimal conditions for spore dispersal. Keller and Segel showed that simple assumptions about an attractive chemical (cyclic AMP), which is both secreted by cells and steers them, could explain such behavior without the need for any master cell that manages the process. They also developed a model for chemotaxis. Hillen and Painter say of it: \\"its success ... a consequence of its intuitive simplicity, analytical tractability and capacity to replicate key behaviour of chemotactic populations. One such property, the ability to display 'auto-aggregation,' has led to its prominence as a mechanism for self-organisation of biological systems. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to finite-time blow-up under certain formulations of the model, and a large body of work has been devoted to determining when blow-up occurs or whether globally existing solutions exist\\". A paper with Jackson was the first to apply Turing's reaction‚Äìdiffusion scheme to population dynamics. Lee Segel also found a way to explain the mechanism from a more intuitive perspective than had previously been used. Administration In 1975 Segel was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics in the Weizmann Institute. A central project was renewing the computer science aspect of the department by bringing simultaneously 4 young leading researchers whom he dubbed the 'Gang of Four' - David Harel (Israel Prize '04), Amir Pnueli (Turing Prize '96, Israel Prize '00), Adi Shamir (Turing Prize '02) and Shimon Ullman (Israel Prize '15). Segel was the editor of the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology between 1986 and 2002. Books Lee Segel was the author of: * Mathematics Applied to Continuum Mechanics (Classics in Applied Mathematics) (with additional material on elasticity by G. H.
