It usually does not cause symptoms but people with prediabetes often have obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. It is also associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Prediabetes is more accurately considered an early stage of diabetes as health complications associated with type 2 diabetes often occur before the diagnosis of diabetes. Prediabetes can be diagnosed by measuring hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, or glucose tolerance test. Many people may be diagnosed through routine screening tests. The primary treatment approach includes lifestyle changes such as exercise and dietary adjustments. Some medications can be used to reduce the risks associated with prediabetes. There is a high rate of progression to type 2 diabetes but not everyone with prediabetes develops type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes can be a reversible condition with lifestyle changes. For many people, prediabetes and diabetes is diagnosed through a routine screening at a check-up. However, an additional routine screening done by dentists, a new and promising concept, and not only medical doctors, can be very effective in early detection and treatment. The earlier prediabetes is diagnosed, the more likely an intervention will be successful. Signs and symptoms Prediabetes typically has no distinct signs or symptoms except the sole sign of high blood sugar. Patients should monitor for signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus such as increased thirst, increased urination, and feeling tired. Causes The cause of prediabetes is multifactorial and is known to have contributions from lifestyle and genetic factors. Ultimately prediabetes occurs when control of insulin and blood glucose in the body becomes abnormal, also known as insulin resistance. Risk factors for prediabetes include family history of diabetes, older age, women who have a history of gestational diabetes or high birth weight babies (greater than 9 lbs.). The increasing rates of prediabetes and diabetes suggest lifestyle and/or environmental factors that contribute to prediabetes. It remains unclear which dietary components are causative and risk is likely influenced by genetic background. Lack of physical activity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and physical activity can reduce the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes. Pathophysiology Normal glucose homeostasis is controlled by three interrelated processes. These processes include gluconeogenesis (glucose production that occurs in the liver), uptake and utilization of glucose by the peripheral tissues of the body, and insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta islet cells. The presence of glucose in the bloodstream triggers the production and release of insulin from the pancreas' beta islet cells. The main function of insulin is to increase the rate of transport of glucose from the bloodstream into certain cells of the body, such as striated muscles, fibroblasts, and fat cells. It also is necessary for transport of amino acids, glycogen formation in the liver and skeletal muscles, triglyceride formation from glucose, nucleic acid synthesis, and protein synthesis. In individuals with prediabetes, a failure of pancreatic hormone release, failure of targeted tissues to respond to the insulin present or both leads to blood glucose rises to abnormally high levels. Diagnosis Prediabetes can be diagnosed with three different types of blood tests: * Fasting blood sugar (glucose) level of: ** 110 to 125 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L) – WHO criteria ** 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L) – ADA criteria *Glucose tolerance test: blood sugar level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mM) 2 hours after ingesting a standardized 75 gram glucose solution * Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between 5.7 and 6.4 percent, ie 38.9 and 46.4 mmol/mol Levels above these limits would justify a diagnosis for diabetes. =Impaired fasting glucose= Impaired fasting glycemia or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) refers to a condition in which the fasting blood glucose is elevated above what is considered normal levels but is not high enough to be classified as diabetes mellitus. It is considered a pre-diabetic state, associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology, although of lesser risk than impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IFG sometimes progresses to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fasting blood glucose levels are in a continuum within a given population, with higher fasting glucose levels corresponding to a higher risk for complications caused by the high glucose levels. Some patients with impaired fasting glucose also may be diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance, but many have normal responses to a glucose tolerance test. Fasting glucose is helpful in identifying prediabetes when positive but has a risk of false negatives. World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for impaired fasting glucose differs from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, because the normal range of glucose is defined differently by each. Fasting plasma glucose levels 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) and higher have been shown to increase complication rates significantly, however, WHO opted to keep its upper limit of normal at under 110 mg/dL for fear of causing too many people to be diagnosed as having impaired fasting glucose, whereas the ADA lowered the upper limit of normal to a fasting plasma glucose under 100 mg/dL. * WHO criteria: fasting plasma glucose level from 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dL) to 6.9 mmol/L (125 mg/dL) * ADA criteria: fasting plasma glucose level from 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) to 6.9 mmol/L (125 mg/dL) =Impaired glucose tolerance= Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is diagnosed with an oral glucose tolerance test. According to the criteria of the World Health Organization and the American Diabetes Association, impaired glucose tolerance is defined as: * two-hour glucose levels of 140 to 199 mg per dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/l) on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. A patient is said to be under the condition of IGT when he/she has an intermediately raised glucose level after 2 hours, but less than the level that would qualify for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The fasting glucose may be either normal or mildly elevated. From 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States have impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose. = Hemoglobin A1c = Hemoglobin A1c is a measure of the percent of red blood cells that are glycated, or have a glucose molecule attached. This can be used as an indicator of blood glucose level over a longer period of time and is often used to diagnose prediabetes as well as diabetes. HbA1c may not accurately represent blood glucose levels and should not be used in certain medical conditions such as iron-deficiency anemia, Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, pregnancy, hemolytic anemia, an enlarged spleen, and end-stage kidney failure. =Fasting Insulin= Estimate of insulin resistance (IR) and insulin sensitivity (%S) according to the Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Patterns were modeled as a function of fasting plasma insulin and varying fasting plasma glucose. Calculated using HOMA Calculator. Adapted from Hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance may occur in individuals with normal glucose levels and therefore is not diagnosed with usual tests. Hyperinsulinemia precedes prediabetes and diabetes that are characterized by hyperglycemia. Insulin resistance can be diagnosed by measures of plasma insulin, both fasting or during a glucose tolerance test. The use of fasting insulin to identify patients at risk has been proposed, but is currently not commonly used in clinical practice. The implications of hyperinsulinemia is the risk of comorbidities related to diabetes that may precede changes in blood glucose, including cardiovascular diseases. Screening Fasting plasma glucose screening should begin at age 30–45 and be repeated at least every three years. Earlier and more frequent screening should be conducted in at-risk individuals. The risk factors for which are listed below: * Family history (parent or sibling) * Dyslipidemia (triglycerides > 200 or HDL < 35) * Overweight or obesity (body mass index > 25) * History of gestational diabetes or infant born with birth weight greater than * High risk ethnic group (such as of being of African American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian American or Pacific Islander heritage) * Hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) * Prior fasting blood glucose > 99 * Known vascular disease * Markers of insulin resistance (PCOS, acanthosis nigricans)\\"ADA: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes\\", Diabetes Care 27: Supp 1.515, 2004.\\"Diabetes Guidelines Taskforce: AACE Guidelines for the Management of DM\\", Endocrin Pract 1995, 1.149 = Prediabetes Screening in a Dental Setting =  Screening  The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends adults who are overweight/obese and aged 40–70 years old to get screened during visits to their regular physician. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends normal testing repeated every three years and recommends a larger range of people get tested: anyone over the age of 45 regardless of risk; an adult of any age who is obese or overweight and has one or more risk factors, which includes hypertension, a first degree relative with diabetes, a physical inactivity, high risk race/ethnicity, Asian Americans with BMI of ≥23 kg/m2, HDL < 35 mg/dL or TG > 250 mg/dL, women who have delivered child >9 lbs or with gestational diabetes, A1c ≥ 5.7%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). It’s been found that people will visit their dentist more regularly than their primary physician for checkups, so the dentist’s office becomes a very useful place for potentially checking for diabetes. For people who are unaware of their diabetes risk and fall into the non-White, obese, or ≥45 y old category, screening at the dentist’s would have the highest odds of getting identified as someone at risk. Studies have been done to evaluate the overall effectiveness and value of prediabetes testing in the dental setting, usually at dental schools. One study has looked at screening through dental visits followed up by intervention programs such as the commercial Weight Watchers and found it a cost-effective means to identify and treat affected people in the long term. Cost is a factor people at risk might need to consider, since, on average, people diagnosed with diabetes have approximately 2.3 times higher medical expenditure that what expenditures would be in its absence. A simple test may be instituted at the dentist’s office, in which an oral blood sample is taken during a normal visit to the dentist’s. This sample tests for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels; HbA1c gives healthcare professionals an idea of blood glucose levels and is the most reliable form of testing for diabetes in asymptomatic patients. Fasting and “acute perturbations” are not needed for HbA1c test and it reveals average glycemic control over 3 month period. HbA1c less than 5.6% is considered normal. Glucose status can also be tested through fasting blood sugar (FBS) and requires a blood sample after a patient has fasted for at least eight hours, so it might not be as convenient. Patients who have gotten oral blood samples taken say it feels as if part of a normal procedure, and dentists say it is convenient. In a study that analyzed data from 10,472 adults from 2013 to 2014 and 2015 to 2016, it was revealed that screening for risk of prediabetes in the dental setting has the potential to alert an estimated 22.36 million adults. Diabetes may be asymptomatic for a long time, but since it would be wasteful to test every patient at the dental office, utilizing known risk factors may guide who is ideal for testing. Since a history is already taken at a dental office, a few additional questions would help guide a dentist on narrowing down who the test is recommended for. For example, people with high BMI are at higher risk for diabetes. A study done by the School of Dentistry, Diabetes Research Centre, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences in Sari, Iran found a relation between periodontitis and the prediabetic condition, and this could be another tool to help guide who might be recommended to take the test. Periodontal disease occurs when a number of anaerobic bacteria living on the tooth surface cause infections, which leads to a potentially sustained immune response. Diabetes is a type of condition in which infections are easier to get, and hyperglycemia contributes to the mechanism causing oral complications.  Early Detection and Management  Over half the people who are diagnosed with prediabetes eventually develop type 2 diabetes and once diagnosed with prediabetes, people experience a range of emotions: distress and fear; denial and downplay of risks; guilt and self- criticism; and self-compassion. While prediabetes is a reversible condition, it requires diet change and exercise, which may be more difficult for people diagnosed prediabetes because facing the risk of a chronic condition is associated with negative emotions, which further hinder the self-regulation that is required in reversing a prediabetes diagnosis. Still, without taking action, 37% of individuals with prediabetes will develop diabetes in only 4 years, and lifestyle intervention may decrease the percentage of prediabetic patients in whom diabetes develops to 20%. The National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has a Center of Disease Control (CDC)-recognized lifestyle change program that showed prediabetic people following the structured program can cut their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58% (71% for people over 60 years old). Considering the possibility to recover from the prediabetic status but also this emotional struggle upon diagnosis, it is encouraged for higher risk patients to get tested early. Having an additional screening option in the dental setting may offset some of the emotional struggle because it is more regularly visited and therefore has the potential to initiate earlier recognition and intervention. Prevention The American College of Endocrinology (ACE) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) have developed lifestyle intervention guidelines for preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes: * Healthy diet (a diet with limited refined carbohydrates, added sugars, trans fats, as well as limited intake of sodium and total calories) * Physical fitness (30–45 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per day, 3–5 days a week) * Weight loss by as little as 5–10 percent may have a significant impact on overall health Management There is evidence that prediabetes is a curable disease state. Although some drugs can delay the onset of diabetes, lifestyle modifications play a greater role in the prevention of diabetes. Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found a 16% reduction in diabetes risk for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a low-fat diet and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5–10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation. There are many dietary approaches that can reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Most involve the reduction of added sugars and fats but there remains a lack of conclusive evidence proving the best approach. For patients with severe risk factors, prescription medication may be appropriate. This may be considered in patients for whom lifestyle therapy has failed, or is not sustainable, and who are at high-risk for developing type 2 diabetes.UptoDate: Prediction and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus; www.utdol.com/utd/content/topic.do?topicKey=diabetes. Metformin and acarbose help prevent the development of frank diabetes, and also have a good safety profile. Evidence also supports thiazolidinediones but there are safety concerns, and data on newer agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP4 inhibitors or meglitinides are lacking. Prognosis The progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus is not inevitable for those with prediabetes. The progression into diabetes mellitus from prediabetes is approximately 25% over three to five years. This increases to 50% risk of progressing to diabetes over 10 years. Diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Effects of the disease may affect larger blood vessels (e.g., atherosclerosis within the larger arteries of the cardiovascular system) or smaller blood vessels, as seen with damage to the retina of the eye, damage to the kidney, and damage to the nerves. Prediabetes is a risk factor for mortality and there is evidence of cardiovascular disease developing prior to a diagnosis of diabetes. Epidemiology Studies conducted from 1988–1994 indicated that of the total population of US in the age group 40–74 years, 34% had IFG, 15% had IGT, and 40% had prediabetes (IFG, IGT, or both). Eighteen million people (6% of the population) had type 2 diabetes in 2002.CDC: Diabetes. National Diabetes Fact Sheet; United States, 2003. The incidence of diabetes is growing. In 2014, 29.1 million people or 9% of the US population had diabetes. In 2011–2012, the prevalence of diabetes in the U.S. using hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose or the two-hour plasma glucose definition was 14% for total diabetes, 9% for diagnosed diabetes, 5% for undiagnosed diabetes and 38% for prediabetes.

The name \\"Aktobe\\" comes from Kazakh \\"Ak\\" (white) and \\"tobe\\" (hill); supposedly, Aktobe's initial settlers were able to see white mountains far to the north. The Aktobe regional capital is the city of Aktobe. Aktobe region in the Western part of Kazakhstan. The area is 300,629 km2 (2-nd place in Kazakhstan), which is 11 % of the territory of Kazakhstan. The population of 888,2 thousand persons at the beginning of 1 august 2020. It was formed as a result of the administrative-territorial reform on March 10, 1932 as part of the cossack KSSR. Historically, it was preceded by the Aktobe district, which existed in 1921-1928. In 1936, the region became part of the Kazakh SSR separated from the RSFSR and since 1991, after the collapse of the USSR, as part of the independent Republic of Kazakhstan. The region is bordered to the North by the Orenburg region of Russia, to the northeast by the Kostanay region, to the Southeast by the Karaganda and Kyzylorda regions of Kazakhstan, to the South by the Republic of Karakalpakstan of Uzbekistan, to the southwest by the Mangistau region, to the West by the Atyrau region and to the Northwest by the West Kazakhstan region of Kazakhstan. The administrative center is the largest city of Western Kazakhstan, Aktobe (from 1891 to 1999 — Aktobe hence the name of the region).

History  Relations with the Kingdom of Italy were difficult during the papacies of Pius IX and Leo XIII, who had to endure the status of prisoner of the Vatican after the capture of Rome, refusing to recognize the Law of Guarantees. Leo XIII forbade Christians from participating in elections and accused the Italian state of being controlled by freemasons. It was only under Pius XI that the Lateran Treaty was signed, establishing the State of Vatican City, allowing for greater papal autonomy. The new Italian Republic established in 1946 recognize freedom of religion. However, under Pius XII and Paul VI, the Christian Democrats thrived and had great influence on Italian politics, in order to stop the Italian Communist Party getting into power.  Diplomatic Legations to the Vatican in Italy  Due to the size of the Vatican City State, embassies accredited to the Holy See are based on Italian territory. Treaties signed between Italy and the Vatican City State permit such embassages. The Embassy of Italy to the Holy See is unique amongst foreign embassages in that it is the only embassy based on its home territory. The Holy See maintains formal diplomatic relations with 176 sovereign states, the European Union, and the Order of Malta; 69 of the diplomatic missions accredited to the Holy See are situated in Rome, though those countries then have two embassies in the same city, since, by agreement between the Holy See and Italy, the same person cannot be accredited simultaneously to both. This is shown clearly by the fact that Italy recognizes the People's Republic of China, and as such, the PRC Embassy to Italy is in Rome. However, the Vatican City State recognizes the Republic of China (which controls Taiwan), and as such, the ROC Embassy to the Holy See is also in Rome. As Italy was the first country to recognize the Holy See as a sovereign nation, their embassy was the first one established.

Li Cheng learned painting style from Jing Hao and Guan Tong at first but turned to focus on nature and developing his own style. He was also good at poetry and articles; but he did not pay much attention to that. He was not interested in working for the government. Many nobles wanted Li Cheng to work for them, but Li Cheng never accepted. There was a prestigious person named Sun who always wanted to get a painting from Li Cheng. So he tried to offer Li Cheng a job in exchange for his painting. However, Li Cheng refused to do so. Sun then paid money to someone who knew Li Cheng and helped him to steal a painting. After a while, Li Cheng saw his work hanging on Sun's wall; he was very angry and never contacted with the one who stole his painting. During his later years, he traveled around and died in Huaiyang County. Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, and Guan Tong together became known as the \\"three great rival artists\\". He did many landscape paintings with diluted ink, known as \\"treating ink like gold\\", which gives the appearance of being in a foggy dream. At that time, he was considered the best landscape painter of all time. He was known to have carried on an artistic dialogue with Wu Daoxuan through their respective paintings. Li Cheng primarily portrayed Shandong area landscapes in his paintings. Artists of later generations, such as Guo Xi, modeled their teaching on his painting style and methods. His works include “Jigger\\", \\"Joy in Fishing\\", \\"Cold crow\\", and \\"Landscape\\". One extant painting, \\"Reading Stele Nest Stone\\", was a collaboration between him and Wang Xiao.

Researcher Igor Chechushkov, indicated that the Andronovites had an ability on horse riding several centuries earlier than many researchers had previously expected. Among the horses investigated, the stallion was nearly 20 years old and the mare was 18 years old. According to scientists, animals were buried with the person they accompanied throughout their lives, and they were used not only for food, but also for harnessing to vehicles and riding. \\"It is likely that militarized elite, whose power was based on the physical control of fellow tribesmen and neighbors with the help of riding and fighting skills, was buried in the Novoilinovsky-2 burial ground. The rider has a significant advantage over the infantryman. There may be another explanation: These elite fulfilled the function of mediating conflicts within the collective, and therefore had power and high social status. Metaphorically, this kind of elite can be called Sheriffs of the Bronze Age\\" said Igor Chechushkov.

Preparation Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide can be prepared by the nucleophilic substitution reaction of tri-n-butylamine with n-butyl bromide. Properties and uses Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide is used to prepare other salts of the tetrabutylammonium cation by salt metathesis reactions, and acts as a source of nucleophilic bromide ions for substitution reactions. It is one of the most commonly-used phase transfer catalysts. As its melting point is just over 100 °C and decreases in the presence of other reagents, it can be considered an ionic liquid. As an ionic liquid, it might be used as a solvent in various reactions, for instance cross-coupling reactions.

Biography He was born at Treviso, but worked chiefly at Florence. Lasinio started as a painter at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice. He quickly placed more emphasis on printmaking, especially after moving to Florence in 1778. He established his reputation with two large series of etchings in 1787 and 1789. Lasinio also taught engraving at the Accademia in Florence, becoming a Professor in 1800. Lasinio moved to Pisa in 1807, taking up the position of conservatore of the Camposanto. He made considerable efforts to protect the Camposanto and its frescoes from ruin, from which it was threatened due to the destructive effects of the Napoleonic wars. In 1812 he began his influential book of etchings, recording the frescoes in the Camposanto. This was entitled, Pitture a fresco del Campo Santo di Pisa. These large etchings were composed in the sharply defined \\"outline style\\", which was popular in the early nineteenth century in reaction to the soft tonal effects of 18th century stipple engravers such as Francesco Bartolozzi. These works proved to be very influential on 19th-century European art, particularly on the Pre-Raphaelites in Britain. According to William Holman Hunt, study of Lasinio's book convinced the group to reject High Renaissance art in favour of these earlier works. Lasinio's engravings also proved an important record of the frescoes, which were eventually severely damaged by bombing in World War II. Other works depicting the old masters included his forty plates of Frescoes and Oil Paintings at Florence (1789), large etchings which delineated the most famous Renaissance frescoes in Florence; and thirty-two plates of Frescoes of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries. Among his other activities Lasinio also founded the Academy in Pisa, where he died. Apart from his many series of engravings and etchings, Lasinio also created original images. His portrayals of eminent Italians include the great explorers, Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci. His son, Giovanni Paolo Lasinio, was also an engraver.

In 1858, Poti was granted the status of a port city, but it was not until 1899 when, under the patronage of the mayor of Poti Niko Nikoladze, the construction entered the sprint stages and was completed by 1907.

Webb played for the England national team from 1987 to 1993, reaching the 1991 World Cup Final and winning two Five Nations grand slam titles. Since retiring from sport in 1993, he has focused on his career in orthopaedic surgery and has treated a number of professional rugby players and athletes. His father was the noted paediatrician John Webb. Rugby union career =Club level= Webb played top-flight rugby union during the game’s final years as an amateur sport. He attended the University of Bristol Medical School from 1982-1987, where he studied medicine and played for the university rugby union team. In 1985 Webb joined Bristol Rugby, while continuing his medical degree. The team reached the final of the 1987-88 John Player Cup, but were beaten by Harlequins. He joined Bath in 1990, staying until his retirement in 1993. Bath were dominant in European rugby during this time. Webb was part of the team that won the English Premiership in 1990-91, 1991-92, and 1992-92, and the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 1990 and 1992. =International level= Webb made his England debut at the 1987 Rugby World Cup, against host nation Australia on 23 May. He was a fixture in the team for the next two years, but was dropped in favour of Simon Hodgkinson in the second half of 1989, on the grounds of Hodgkinson's more consistent kicking both from hand and from place-kicks, and did not play for the next couple of years, thus missing out on the Five Nations Grand Slam of 1991 (and on the near-miss in 1990). Recalled for the summer tour and the World Cup later that autumn - on the grounds that he was more adventurous going forward and gave England greater options in the back line, after criticism of their forward-heavy tactics in the 1991 Grand Slam - he was in the England team that reached the 1991 World Cup Final, kicking his country’s only points as they lost to Australia 12-6. Webb also was part of the team that won England's second successive Five Nations championship Grand Slam in 1992: including perhaps his finest performance, scoring two tries (the first after less than a minute) in the 38-9 victory over Ireland in addition to kicking four conversions and two penalties. In addition to the consistency of his much-improved kicking throughout the tournament, he added another try against France in the next match as well. He continued to represent England until 1993, winning 33 caps and scoring a total of 296 points. He played his final international against Ireland on 20 March 1993. Webb retired from sport in 1993 to focus on his career as a surgeon. “I didn’t think I would be able to carry on doing both,” he has said. “By that stage in 1993 I had two kids, was a registrar, living in Bristol, working in Swindon and the time required for rugby was growing.” In June 2016 Webb was appointed as a World Rugby Council RFU representative. Surgical career Since retiring in 1993, Webb has developed a career in knee surgery and sports medicine, specialising in keyhole surgery and knee ligament reconstruction. In 1996 he undertook a year- long fellowship at the North Sydney Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Centre in Australia. In 1999 he was named an Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Bristol. In 2011 Webb co-founded Fortius Clinic in London along with fellow surgeons Andy Williams and James D. F. Calder, where he practices as a consultant orthopaedic knee surgeon. In 2014 he became a patron of the Southern Spinal Injuries Trust. In 2018 he took on a new role as president of Young Bristol.

It is primarily expressed in the parathyroid gland and the renal tubules of the kidney. In the parathyroid gland, it controls calcium homeostasis by regulating the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In the kidney it has an inhibitory effect on the reabsorption of calcium, potassium, sodium, and water depending on which segment of the tubule is being activated. Signal transduction The release of PTH is inhibited in response to elevations in plasma calcium concentrations and activation of the calcium receptor. Increased calcium binding on the extracellular side gives a conformational change in the receptor, which, on the intracellular side, initiates the phospholipase C pathway,InterPro: IPR000068 GPCR, family 3, extracellular calcium-sensing receptor-related Retrieved on June 2, 2009 presumably through a Gqα type of G protein, which ultimately increases intracellular concentration of calcium, which inhibits vesicle fusion and exocytosis of parathyroid hormone. It also inhibits (not stimulates, as some sources state) the cAMP dependent pathway. Pathology Mutations that inactivate a CaSR gene cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) (also known as familial benign hypercalcemia because it is generally asymptomatic and does not require treatment), when present in heterozygotes. Patients who are homozygous for CaSR inactivating mutations have more severe hypercalcemia. Other mutations that activate CaSR are the cause of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia or Type 5 Bartter syndrome. An alternatively spliced transcript variant encoding 1088 aa has been found for this gene, but its full-length nature has not been defined. Therapeutic application The drugs cinacalcet and etelcalcetide are allosteric modifiers of the calcium-sensing receptor. They are classified as a calcimimetics, binding to the calcium-sensing receptor and decreasing parathyroid hormone release. Calcilytic drugs, which block CaSR, produce increased bone density in animal studies and have been researched for the treatment of osteoporosis. Unfortunately clinical trial results in humans have proved disappointing, with sustained changes in bone density not observed despite the drug being well tolerated. More recent research has shown the CaSR receptor to be involved in numerous other conditions including Alzheimer's disease, asthma and some forms of cancer, and calcilytic drugs are being researched as potential treatments for these. Recently it has been shown that biomimetic bone like apatite inhibits formation of bone through endochondral ossification pathway via hyperstimulation of extracellular calcium sensing receptor.

The Need to Rethink Analysis, Precision Marketing, 14 November 1988. The subject of micromarketing was developed further in an article in February 1990, which emphasised understanding markets at the local level, and also the personalisation of messages to individual consumers in the context direct marketing.Whitehead, John. Paying Attention to Detail, Marketing, 22 February 1990. Micromarketing has come to refer to marketing strategies which are variously customised to either local markets, to different market segments, or to the individual customer. Micromarketing is a marketing strategy in which marketing and/or advertising efforts are focused on a small group of tightly targeted consumers. For example, markets can be grouped into narrow clusters based on commitment to a product class or readiness to purchase a given brand. The approach requires a company to define very narrow market segments, and tailor offers or campaigns for that segment. Although, the approach can be more expensive due to customization and difficulties attaining scale economies, advancements in technology have facilitated the delivery of highly customised products to small groups or even individual customers. Nike IDNikeiD, http://www.nike.com/au/en_gb/c/nikeid; allows customers to create their own designs and Shoes of PreyShoes of Prey, https://www.shoesofprey.com; allows customers to design their own shoes are often cited as practical examples of this approach. It should be evident that micromarketing is closely related to the concept of mass-customisation. In some of the literature, different labels are used to describe micromarketing. In a seminal article, Kara and Karnak (1997), referred to finer segmentation (FS) as \\"the final advancement in market segmentation as it combines the use of differentiated marketing and niche marketing to reach the smallest groups in the marketplace\\".Kara, A. and Kaynak, E. (1997). Markets of a Single Customer: Exploiting Conceptual Developments in Market Segmentation. European Journal of Marketing. 31. (11/12). pp. 873-885 Richard Tedlow (1993) thought that he detected evidence of what he called hyper-segmentation which he saw as a logical extension of the market segmentation era.In his oft-cited work, New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America, Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp 4-12, Richard Tedlow outlines three stages: Fragmentation (pre 1880s) in which markets operated at a regional level; Unification or Mass Marketing (1880s-1920s); Segmentation (1920s-1980s)- marketing differentiation based on demographic, socio-economic and lifestyle factors. In a subsequent work, published three years later, the author added a fourth era, termed Hyper- segmentation (post 1980s); See Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing, Routledge, N.Y., 1993 Ch 2, the authors added as the fourth era These approaches combine multiple segmentation variables in ways that have been elusive within conventional approaches to segmentation. Micromarketing or hyper-segmentation rely on the extensive information technology, big databases, computerized and flexible manufacturing systems, and integrated distribution systems. Data is captured from electronic communications devices, mapped and logged with a management information system. This enables the integration of observed behaviour (domains accessed) with motives (content involvement), geographics (IP addresses), demographics (self-reported registration details) and brand preferences (site-loyalty, site stickiness). Additional data inputs might include behavioural variables such as frequency (site visits), diversity including visitation across different landscapes and fluidity spanning multiple time periods. Programmed business intelligence software analyses this data and in the process, may also source data inputs from other internal information networks. Given this reliance on digital data inputs, some theorists have also used the term, cyber-segmentation to describe micromarketing.Louvieris, P., Driver, J. 2001. New Frontiers in Cybersegmentation: Marketing Success in Cyberspace Depends in IP address. Qualitative Market Research. 4. (3). pp. 169-181. The level of targeting can sometimes boil down to 'one-on-one marketing' or individual marketing, wherein the needs and wants of the individual buyer are taken into consideration. It revolves around targeting one customer and providing them with products and services which they desire. It often requires mass customisation of products and services. If the marketer is able to carry it out on a large scale perfectly, it proves highly successful. For instance, offering the chance to customers to customise M&M; candies in their preferred colour with custom printed alphabets gave the company a unique way to market their product. With increased availability of electronic scanner data there has been a greater focus on research of micromarketing and pricing problems that retailers encounter. Research in 1995 by Stephen J. Hoch et al. provided empirical evidence for the micromarketing concept. In 1997, Alan Montgomery used hierarchical Bayes models to improve the estimation procedures of price elasticities, showing that micromarketing strategies can increase gross profits.Weitz, Barton and Robin Wensley. Handbook of Marketing, SAGE 2002. \\"Global ad spending is predicted to reach $662.73 billion by 2018. Unfortunately, a lot of those dollars will go to waste.\\" However, the advent of micromarketing or hypersegmentation allows advertisers the opportunity to get \\"more bang for their buck\\" by targeting consumers who exhibit a readiness to buy. A report from 2007 by Tech Crunch titled \\"Facebook Will Use Profiles To Target Ads, Predict Future\\" talks about how Facebook was planning to target individuals based on each particular profile. Moreover, the Wall Street Journal claimed in a report, that the new system will \\"let marketers target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal on the site about themselves.\\" See also *Marketing *Marketing research *Mass marketing *Microsegment *Microsegmenting *Niche market *Mass customization  References  Marketing techniques Market segmentation ","title":"Micromarketing"},{"id":"13227084","text":"Remlingen is a municipality in the district of Würzburg in Bavaria in Germany.

He was the founder of the Atmavidya Sangham, which was fundamentally a group of professionals and intellectuals who sought change, and also the Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society.  Life  Vagbhatananda was born in 1885 near to Thalassery in Kerala, India. He was given the name V. K. Gurukkal,he was educated in the traditional gurukkal system, through which he gained a proficiency in scriptures and philosophy. Following this, according to the historian K. K. N. Kurup, he travelled widely to propagate \\"the teachings of universal non-duality for a better and egalitarian society.\\" His oratorical abilities led to him being given the name of Vagbhatananda by a swami named brahmananda sivayogi. At some time after 1898, Vagbhatananda founded a school teaching Sanskrit in Calicut, where he also took interest in the work of the Brahma Samaj that had been founded there that year by Ayyathan Gopalan. In 1920, Vagbhatananda founded the Atmavidya Sangham, whose principles he outlined in an Advaita treatise titled Atmavidya. Unlike the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP), which had been established by Narayana Guru and was significant around the same time, the Atmavidya Sangham comprised mostly professional and intellectual people and it had a more secular approach to reform. It was instrumental in advancing the development of class organisation among peasants of the region, spreading Marxist–Leninist ideas as a counter to the overbearing feudal and religiously orthodox establishment. Vagbhatananda himself criticised both economic exploitation and the role of foreign governments in supporting it. Vagbhatananda, who was married, died in October 1939. Kurup has described him as a \\"good combination of an erudite scholar, reformer, organiser, journalist and nationalist. ... His authority was the ancient wisdom of Hinduism, not the dogmatism of theology.\\" The significance of the Atmavidya Sangham declined after his death, being superseded by other secular-oriented reform groups such as the Karshaka Sangham that adopted its agenda. However, it was still active in the 1980s. Vagbhatananda inspired the formation of Uralungal Labor Contract Co-operative Society IN 1925.

It was first serialized in the weekly Japanese manga magazine Weekly Young Magazine in March 2004. The slice of life comedy focuses on the everyday life of three sisters: Haruka, Kana, and Chiaki Minami. An anime series produced by Daume aired in 2007. Asread produced a second season in 2008 titled Minami-ke: Okawari, a third season in 2009 titled Minami-ke: Okaeri, and an original video animation (OVA) episode in 2009 titled Minami-ke: Betsubara. In 2012, Feel produced another OVA titled Minami-ke: Omatase, followed by a fourth anime series in 2013 titled Minami-ke: Tadaima. Plot A slice of life comedy about the day-to-day life of the Minami family, sisters Haruka, Kana, and Chiaki; and their friends and classmates. The three sisters live alone. Characters =Minami sisters = ; : :Haruka is the oldest sister and in her second year of high school. She has been taking care of her younger sisters for many years, which led to some misunderstandings with her classmates. Haruka is the most reliable of the three sisters, but is infinitely lazy when she is by herself. She was called Banchō (gang leader) during her junior-high days, though it is revealed soon after that it was simply a title. She is the only person whom Chiaki views as a role model and greatly respects. This can be seen in her tendency to address Haruka as \\"nee- sama\\" instead of the more usual and casual \\"nee-san\\"; and the only person Chiaki uses polite Japanese with (even though it is not customary for siblings to use polite Japanese towards each other). \\"Haruka\\" contains the kanji for \\"spring\\". ; : :Kana is the middle sister in her second year of junior-high school. Kana is an impulsive and lively girl who never thinks before acting. She is a horrible cook, a chronic oversleeper, and is obsessed with Chiaki treating her as an adorable older sister rather than as a foil. She often acts or talks impolitely without thinking, much to the annoyance of Chiaki. She has been misled by Chiaki into thinking that Fujioka has a grudge against her rather than a crush. She generally does not get good grades in school, though she thinks that if she puts on Keiko's glasses she will act and speak intelligently. She frequently invents random new holidays and also recruits Chiaki's classmates into joining her silly escapades. \\"Kana\\" contains the kanji for \\"summer\\". ; : :Chiaki is the youngest sister in elementary school. She is in class 5-2 (a reference to Kyo no Gononi). Her high intelligence often makes her over-analyze simple situations; her speech patterns are those of an adult male and her wit is caustic. She is extremely cynical and tends to ignore idiotic behavior displayed by Kana and Makoto. She respects and adores Haruka, while often, if not always, resorts to beating Kana for her idiocy. Although being the youngest, she is the meanest out of the three; most of the time, she is quiet during group activities, and almost always uses the word \\"bakayarō\\" (meaning 'dumbass' or simply 'you fool' in Japanese), which is a more forceful form for \\"idiot\\" in Japanese (\\"baka\\" being the less forceful term). Chiaki seems to know that Fujioka is genuinely in love with Kana. After talking with Haruka, Chiaki has come to associate Fujioka as a father figure and will often place herself on his lap when she seeks fatherly affection or to complete the family experience. She seems to like Fuyuki, and seems to miss him after moving away. \\"Chiaki\\" contains the kanji for \\"autumn\\". =Other Minami family= ; : :Tōma is a tomboy girl in class 5-1 who, despite having the same surname, is not related to the Minami sisters. However, Chiaki adopted her as a little brother because of the same surname. She has three older brothers that know nothing about her. Her tomboy action can be said to be an influence by her brothers. The way she acts, looks and dresses causes Fujioka to actually believe that she is a boy. \\"Tōma\\" contains the kanji for \\"winter\\"; Chiaki declares that Tōma is the younger because \\"winter follows autumn\\". She is very good at sewing; she is able to make a teddy bear similar to the one owned by Chiaki. ; : :He is the eldest son of the other Minami family. It is unclear whether or not he is still in high school. Though calm and composed in his demeanor, it seems as though he is in a state of denial concerning the adverse effects the brothers' lifestyle is having on their younger sister. \\"Haru\\" in his name probably refers to \\"spring.\\" Despite being the eldest, Haruo's physical strength is underwhelming, compared to Natsuki, being sent meters away by a mere pat to the shoulder. ; : :Second son of the other Minami family, and is in first year of high school. He used to be a delinquent, but had calmed down after Hosaka recruited him to the volleyball club. He got beaten up by Haruka the first time they met due to a misunderstanding, with him touching her chest (in the manga, he accidentally hugs her instead). Despite this, he harbors no ill feelings towards her and instead shows signs of embarrassment and indirect affection towards her, this is made evident when the eldest Minami brother talks about having a girlfriend and Natsuki immediately pictures a provocatively dressed Haruka in his mind and suffers a nose-bleed. \\"Natsu\\" in his name probably refers to \\"summer.\\" ; : :Third son of the other Minami family, and is in first year of junior high school. Maybe because of the gap in their age, he is treated as a child in the other Minami household and is often told not to interrupt when the other two elder brothers are talking. He likes long-haired girls, especially Riko, who is in the same class as Kana. Fujioka dislikes him because he assumes that he is close to Kana. He crossdresses as Aki-chan when he is around Fujioka inside the Minami household. \\"Aki\\" in his name probably refers to \\"autumn.\\" =High school students= ; : :Haruka's classmate and a bit of an airhead. A member of the volleyball club. She tries to protect Haruka from Hosaka, a running gag, which always end with her remarking Hosaka as . ; : :Haruka's classmate. A member of the volleyball club. A very quiet girl, quite similar in character to Keiko. ; : :A third year, and captain of the volleyball club. He greatly admires Haruka and would like her to become the volleyball club's manager, and his girlfriend. He has a tendency to act cool, stripping and fantasizing in front of people, to the point of being considered a narcissist, causing those who know him to label him as a weirdo, especially Maki and her signature phrase of labeling him as \\"disgusting\\". He is also skilled at cooking and is a perfectionist at it. ; : :Third year. A member of the volleyball club (often acting like the leader of their team) as well as an associate of Hosaka. She is cunning and mischievous and is often thinking of rather devious plans (usually involving Haruka and Hosaka). She is good at manipulating Hosaka. She has a distinctive smiling expression and loves alcohol which she calls high- grade \\"juice\\". Kana is the only one smart enough not to drink the \\"juice\\", while still managing to get everyone else drunk. ; : :She is a first-year student in the same class as Natsuki. She has an interest in him and believes she can read him by looking at his eyes. When Natsuki forgot his lunch, she offered him some of hers, then lent him money to buy a yakisoba-pan, and when he forgot his umbrella, she offered a pink one decorated with bunnies to him to use. However, she also mistakenly interprets Natsuki's love-struck look at Haruka to be directed at herself and believes Natsuki has feelings for her. =Junior-high school students= ; : :Kana's classmate. He plays soccer and is a popular classmate of Kana. He is in love with Kana. But Chiaki reads his love letters as letters of challenge, which Kana believes nicknaming him , meaning a leader of juvenile delinquents, as a result. Although it was only a nickname given to him by Kana during that time, he officially took the title when Yū didn't want it. She deliberately loses a rock-paper-scissor game with Fujioka in order to get rid of it, making Fujioka the fourth generation Banchō. He is a bit naive and very innocent towards girls. His affection towards Kana will often make him do regrettable things but because of them he has had the opportunity to become closer with the family and visits them often. Chiaki has come to associate him as a father figure and will often place herself on his lap when she seeks fatherly affection or to complete the family experience. He is the only person who does not know that Tōma is actually a girl. ; : :Kana's friend, an honor student. She is often ignorantly persuaded by Kana and dragged into her silly escapades. ; : :Kana's classmate. She has a crush on Fujioka and views Kana as a love rival, but befriends her to get close to Fujioka. Also has the same random personality as Kana and is a bully to other girls on the show. ; : :Third year. She is a senior to Kana. Reluctantly nicknamed third generation Banchō in school, Yū gladly hands over the title to Fujioka when she intentionally loses a \\"Rock-Paper-Scissors\\" duel to him. ; : :Third year. Yū's best friend and classmate. ; : :Kana's classmate. She has the same height as Chiaki. =Elementary school students= ; : :Chiaki's classmate. He is nicknamed \\"Idiotic child\\" which his classmates believe is more of an impression of him than a nickname. He has a crush on Haruka, and goes as far as cross dressing (first forced upon him by Kana) to avoid detection from Chiaki, who became jealous and angry with him after he helped Haruka cook dinner, in order to see her at the Minami residence. When he crossdresses, he is referred to as \\"Mako-chan\\". Only Uchida, Kana, and Tōma knows of his cross-dressing habit. ; : :Chiaki's classmate. She seems to be the most responsible and level headed among the characters her age. Might have found out that Mako-chan is really Makoto. ; : :Chiaki's classmate. Nicknamed \\"Plain Yogurt\\" by Chiaki because he does not have any qualities that stand out. ; : :In class 5-1. Chiaki's friend. She helps Makoto with his cross- dressing along with Kana. She is not seen as a smart character and was actually forced by Makoto to join \\"Team Idiot\\". Impulsive and a little lacking in common sense, she is belittled by Chiaki and Keiko often, and recruited by Kana to join her silly escapades. ; : :He is an original character in Okawari. He is a transfer student and a neighbor of the Minami sisters. His inability to refuse favors or demands plagues his very existence and annoys Chiaki to no end. Due to this characteristic behavior, he is often asked to do tasks outside his responsibilities. He seems to like Chiaki. =Other= ; : :First cousin of the three sisters. He occasionally visits the Minami sisters to check up on them and give them their monthly allowance. He often makes blunders and Kana, in contrast to Haruka and Chiaki, feels he is \\"pathetic\\". He later starts to feel some resentment towards Fujioka because he feels as if he is closer to the three girls than he should be. He has an on-and-off relationship with a girl called Reiko. His hair is brown in the first series but changed to green in Okawari; then back to brown in Okaeri. ; : (Ninomiya) : (Sensei) :Characters from a drama television show the Minami family watches during dinner. Ninomiya is a student who falls in love with her unnamed teacher (Sensei). There is a video game adaption of the drama show, owned by Keiko. Media =Manga= Minami-ke was first published as a manga by Koharu Sakuraba. It began serialization in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine on March 1, 2004.

The club was founded in 1990 as a junior club by Les Norris. By 2005, the club was fielding fifteen teams in the Essendon District Football League.www.greenvalefc.com.au  History  Greenvale Football club started in 1990 as a junior club by Les Norris, who died in April 2009. In 1996 Greenvale fielded a senior side for the first time in Essendon DFL B Grade. Greenvale has only been in operation as a senior club for a little over a decade, but already it has established itself as a force to be reckoned with in the powerful Essendon District Football League. Their first premiership came in B Grade in 2002. Greenvale has won 5 senior premierships since the club was first founded. In 2004 Greenvale had finished at the head of the ladder prior to the finals, and went on to win their first A Grade premiership. They finished on top again in 2005 before reaching a second successive premiership play-off after an impressive 2nd semi final demolition of Keilor. The grand final turned into a nightmare, however, as rank outsiders Strathmore stole both the show and the flag with a hard-earned and well-deserved 10 point win. By 2005, the club was fielding fifteen teams in the Essendon District Football League. The 2006 season saw a slight drop in performance level, and Greenvale's premiership aspirations were ended by Doutta Stars on preliminary final day. With former Australian rules players Steve MacPherson and Steve Paxman as senior coach and captain respectively Greenvale has plenty of experience to draw on, and it was no surprise to see them emerge as pace setters in 2007. What was a surprise, however, was the extent of their dominance, for after topping the ladder with 100% success from 18 home and away matches, they swept to an unbeaten premiership on the strength of wins over Strathmore by 57 points in the 2nd semi final and 3 goals in the grand final. The reserves also went top, making it a perfect year all round. In 2008 the club went undefeated, until the Grand Final losing to Keilor 20.12.(132) to 15.9.(99). As of 2009 – Steve MacPherson was the longest serving coach of any side in the EDFL until he announced he was leaving the club at the end of the 2010 season. 2011 saw Anthony Rock take over as senior coach. Greenvale finished the season in third position and faced Maribynong Park in the elimination final. Greenvale steamed to a commanding victory. Greenvale faced Strathmore in the preliminary final and went on to lose to the grand final winners by 22 points. 2012 saw Greenvale retain Anthony Rock as coach and recruit several players mainly Eric Kuret and Daniel Campisano. Greenvale finished a successful season in second position. Greenvale went on to win the 2012 premiership by 2 points (82-80) after trailing by as much as 24 points deep in third term and 17 points at 3/4 time. This was due to a huge influence by Greenvale colt hero Jacob Thompson booting 2 majors in the final term to secure the win, very stiff to miss out on best on ground honors. Season 2013 greenvale finished on top with a 16-2 record in the home and away season. Greenvale lost the first final convincingly 12.22 (94) to 8.11 (59) to Aberfeldie and played beat Airport West in the preliminary final by 58 points. In the grand final, Greenvale was down by 6 points at half time. In a big 3rd quarter, Greenvale kicked 5 goals to 3 to open up a 10 point lead. Greenvale ran out winners by 14 points, with Eric Kuret named best on ground.  Season 2009  In the 2009 season the club started a 2nd under 18's team in the Essendon District Football League. The club went undefeated in the home and away season, before losing the semi final to Maribyrnong Park and the Grand Final also to Maribyrnong Park 14.18.(102) to 13.6.(84). The club also started construction on the 2nd oval and the up grading of the lights on the main oval.  Season 2010  The club began its 2010 pre-season campaign on Monday the 16 November 2009 at Greenvale Reserve. In December 2009 it was named that ex-essendon AFL player Scott Lucas (footballer) would be playing for Greenvale in the 2010 season and he has proved to be a wonderful asset. The club has a total of 18 teams in the league this year, making it the most that the club has ever had and the club is growing each day. The Seniors lost their 1st game in 3 years in a home and away season in Round 6 to Oak Park 15.19.(109) to Greenvale 6.11.(47). The Seniors, Reserves and the Under 18 Div 1 teams all subsequently finished on top of their respective ladders and into the 2010 EDFL Finals. This was the first time in years that all 3 teams have made it into the finals together. The Seniors, Reserves and the Under 18 Div 1 teams all eventually played off in Grand Finals on 12 September 2010 at Essendon's Windy Hill Football Ground. Both the U18s and Reserves were victorious in their matches defeating Keilor Football Club in both instances, with the flagship A-Grade team losing in a close match to reigning back to back premiers Maribyrnong Park, coached by ex-AFL player Brodie Holland. Greenvale's tenacity helped them get to within five points in an exciting final quarter only for Maribyrnong Park to kick two goals in the dying final minutes. The final score during the A-Grade match was Maribyrnong Park 12.18 (90) def. Greenvale 10.13 (73). In October 2010 – After 7 years as coach of the senior side Steve MacPherson announced he won't continue as head coach in 2011 and he will be leaving the club altogether. Steve Paxman and club captain Denis Bicer has also announced they will not be returning to the club on 2011, Bicer has taken up an assistant-coaching role with B Grade club Pascoe Vale  Season 2011  In October 2010 – It was announced that ex-AFL North Melbourne player Anthony Rock was appointed as the new Head Senior coach for season 2011 and now continues this in 2012. The club began its 2012 pre-season campaign in November 2011 under returning Coach Anthony Rock.  Season 2012  Greenvale confirmed the signings of two key players for 2012. Eric Kuret returned from a spell at Balranald and Daniel Campisano from Frankston VFL. The squad was further strengthened with some up and coming talent from the under 18s. Greenvale had an almost perfect year only losing two games to Strathmore who had not list a game from the preliminary final 2011. On the eve of the finals Greenvale lost two of its key players Travis Jorgenson and Dean Smith and there were injury clouds under a number of other stars. In the first final, Greenvale lost to Strathmore by 9 points however felt as though they were the better finishing team. In the preliminary Greenvale accounted for Maribynong park fairly comfortably. Greenvale then faced unbeaten Strathmore in the 2012 grand final. Strathmore were heavy favorites and were odds on $1.60 to win the premiership. Greenvale looked gone through the third quarter but dug deep on the back of Jacob Thompson and Matthew Smith heroics, the Jets won by 2 points. Rowan Nanya was voted best aground to win the medal. Greenvale reserves also beat Strathmore making it a clean sweep for the senior squad.

Tipping’s work with the Melbourne Herald was instrumental improving conditions at Kew Cottages and other disability institutions. Tipping’s vision was for a network of family homes in the community, in which people lived non- institutional lives, in a community setting.  Services  The Foundation now provides disability services, children and family services, and services for people exiting the corrections system. The Foundation established, in 2011, a specialist 30-bed community-based Acquired Brain Injury Rehabilitaton service, in partnership with UK-based The Disabilities Trust. The Foundation has more than 100 service locations across all of Victoria and the Riverina. These include residential services (sometimes known as shared supported accommodation, or group homes) for people with disabilities and for young people, respite facilities and other projects such as supporting people wanting to move towards independent living, ageing carers, and ageing people with disabilities. The Foundation is partnered with Victorian Person Centred Services, an organisation which began in 2004. It provides home and community- based services, including skills development, attendant care, support in educational and work settings, recreational and leisure activities and flexible respite. The Foundation's Vision is \\"Independence. Choice. Community for All\\".  Person-centred approaches  The person-centred philosophy adopted by E. W. Tipping Foundation, and many other community service organisations, is a focus on the individual choice and empowerment. It is a substantial shift from early charity and medical models of service provision. Person-centred services recognise the rights of everyone, regardless of ability, to enjoy equal rights and responsibilities as citizens, choosing the way they want to live, to participate in the community, and to receive respect. Person-centred approaches are often supported by Person Centred Planning.  Community development  The Foundation works to develop communities in Victoria, through co-operation and support of other community organisations, and through development of the community sector, particularly the disability sector. The Foundation is active in National Disability Services, Disability Professionals Victoria, and Australasian Disability Professionals, and was an early advocate of the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme.

J.H. Rosenplänter founded Beiträge zur genauern Kenntniss der ehstnischen Sprache, the journal for studies on Estonian language, literature and folklore. In Beiträge the German translation of Mythologia Fennica by Kristjan Jaak Peterson was published in 1822. In 1839 The Learned Estonian Society was founded as the central organization for collecting and studying Estonian folklore. A leading figure in the society Friedrich Robert Faehlmann published a number of Estonian legends and myths in German based on genuine Estonian folklore and on Ganander's Finnish mythology, \\"The Dawn and Dusk\\" (Koit ja Hämarik Inspired by Faehlmann, the philologist Nikolai Anderson authored a ballad based on this myth: ) being considered one of the most beautiful Estonian myths having popular origin. Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald started collecting Estonian folklore in 1843 but ended up changing the tales considerably. The materials collected primarily from Virumaa were reworked and published as The Old tales of the Estonian People in 1866. In 1842 The Society of the Estonian Literati was founded in Tallinn. Alexander H. Neus' anthology Ehstnische Volkslieder Ehstnische Volkslieder at google books(3 vols; 1850–52) is considered the first scholarly publication on Estonian folksongs.

The total amount collected is approximately 12400 pages. The Old Harp (Vana Kannel) 2 volumes of folksongs were published in 1875–76. Two more volumes were added in 1938 and 1941. The Setus Songs (Setukeste laulud) in 3. volumes was published in 1904–1907. Inspired by Hurt's work, Matthias J. Eisen started folklore collection in the 1880s resulting a collection of 90.000 pages. Oskar Kallas, Ph.D (1868–1946) studied at the University of Helsinki, was the first folklore scholar of Estonian descent. After the establishment of the Republic of Estonia, Walter Anderson was appointed to the newly founded chair of folklore at the University of Tartu.

Soy yogurt, also referred to as Soya yogurt, Soygurt or Yofu (a portmanteau of yogurt and tofu), is yogurt prepared with soy milk. Ingredients Soy yogurt is made using soy milk, adding yogurt bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus), sometimes adding sweeteners such as fructose, glucose, or sugar.Soy yogurt =Non-dairy requirements= It is suitable for vegans, ovo-vegetarians, for people with PKU or other dangerous diseases, and for those with lactose intolerance or milk allergy, as the bacteria for shop- bought soy yogurt are usually not grown on a dairy base. Due to certain recurring doubts and controversies about the bacterial cultures used, most soy yogurt manufacturers nowadays include certified labels, usually by the Vegan Society or similar vegan organisations, clearly visible on the outer packaging. Preparation Soy yogurt can be prepared at home using the same method as dairy yogurt, using soy milk and a starter culture.How to make soy yogurt One tablespoon of sugar per 1 liter of unsweetened soy milk may be added to promote bacterial fermentation. Soy milk on its own lacks the lactose (milk sugar) that is the basic food for the yogurt bacteria. Comparisons Soy yogurt may have a slight beany soy taste when made directly from freshly prepared soy milk, but this is less pronounced in shop-bought soy yogurt and in soy yogurt made from commercial soy milk. Soy yogurt contains less fat than yogurt made with whole milk. This amounts to about 2.7% (the same percentage as soy milk), versus 3.5% in dairy yogurt. However, dairy yogurt can be made with 2%, 1%, or fat-free milk, and soy yogurt can also be made from reduced- fat soy milk.Nutritional values of soy yogurt In 1998, the cost of soy yogurt was similar to dairy yogurt. Soy yogurt is similar in protein content to dairy yogurt, lower in sugar, and higher in fat. If not fortified, soy yogurt does not contain Vitamin B12 or Vitamin D.

The car has a front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout, with a 55R/45F weight distribution. The body was designed by Pete Brock (who designed the original race cars) and a chassis designed by Bob Negstad (who designed the original race chassis), it is viewed by many to be the most authentic modern continuation of the original, very limited run of Shelby Daytona coupes. It is the only Shelby Daytona coupe approved and licensed by Shelby and the only Shelby Daytona coupe aside from the original half-dozen cars eligible for the Shelby Registry. Roush Performance is the official supplier of 50-state-legal engines for the coupe, and the majority of American owners choose a Roush engine based on a 351 Windsor block. Common displacements chosen for the car are 392, 402, and 427 cubic inches. Buyers also have a choice between five- and six-speed transmissions, the latter with a relatively wide choice of gear ratios. The car is considered by many to be an ideal compromise between a historically correct replica and a car suitable for the modern sports car buyer. The cars occupy a pricepoint above a Porsche 911 or Aston Martin V8 Vantage but below a Lamborghini Gallardo or Aston Martin DB9 where few other front-engined GT cars with more than 500 horsepower are available. About 130 such cars exist as of the autumn of 2007, most of them in the United States.

It was designed by Thomas W. Worsdell and five of these tiny engines were built in 1890. These were numbered 559-63. Description The Class K design was not just small, it was diminutive, and as class Y8 these were the smallest steam locomotives used by the LNER. They were fitted with steam and hand brakes only, never having vacuum brakes, and were unusual in having no bunker behind the cab for the coal, but rather having the small amount of coal required stored in a bin at the back of the footplate. The Y8s were built with 'marine' type boilers, i.e. with a cylindrical flue into which the grate fitted. Between 1902 and 1904, they were all re-boilered with more traditional boilers similar to those fitted to the NER Class H locomotives. Originally all of the Y8s were fitted with a single whistle of the bell-shaped type. 560, 561, and 563 acquired the organ type during LNER ownership. 559 also had one of these whistles fitted, but after 1940. In 1942 LNER No.8091 (NER No.560) acquired the chime whistle from the Gresley A4 4469 Sir Ralph Wedgewood when it was damaged during an air raid on York in 1942. By 1946, the original organ-pipe whistle had been restored. Operation and preservation The NER built the K class specifically to shunt the docks at Hull, and it was here that they performed for most of their lives. During World War I No.559 was used both at Woolwich Arsenal and by the Royal Engineers near the mouth of the Humber Estuary. In 1940-41 559 spent a second period on the Spurn Head Railway. No 8091 became Departmental Locomotive No. 55, and acquired a 50A shed plate, being the last of the class when finally withdrawn in June 1954. All five K class locos survived into LNER ownership. However, the Depression- era reduction in dock traffic and the increased use of Sentinel shunters (LNER Class Y1 and LNER Class Y3) led to the scrapping of three Y8s in 1936/7. Numbers 559 and 560 survived to the 1946 renumbering, and were renumbered as 8090 and 8091 respectively. Both survived into British Railways (BR) ownership, but neither survived long enough to acquire an updated '60000' number plate. 8090 was withdrawn in November 1948. None of the original five survived into preservation. There have been rumours that a replica of this class of engine may be built for use at Beamish Museum where its small size and marine type boiler are seen as perfect for the museum's short demonstration line.

History Before the emergence of the internet, micropublishing was considered a \\"microtrend\\" that would not play much of a role in the publishing world, because costs per copy were too high. The internet has changed this by providing authors and micropublishers with an affordable medium through which to publish and distribute their works. The Internet is also evolving how the works from traditional publishing, self- publishing and micro-publishing are distributed. The long imagined dream of digital distribution for published works is quickly becoming a reality. For micro-publications, digital distribution may enable greater numbers of authors and potential authors to enter the publishing industry to access readers who prefer to receive and/or consume content in digital form. Present Presently, digital versions of all publications are subject to copyright piracy since technology makes it easy to replicate perfect copies of digital materials. This is especially true when such materials are displayed on the Web where scraper sites routinely infringe the works of others. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) lets copyright holders protect themselves by sending online service providers \\"take-down notices.\\" Digital copyright holders, however, must first spot unauthorized copies of their works and then find the original infringer, a task made challenging by the vastness of the Internet.Litman, Jessica: Just Say Yes to Licensing!: , page 114. Prometheus Books, 2001. eReaders eReaders from companies such as Apple, Amazon, Sony, and Barnes and Noble may help both traditional publishers and micro-publishers solve the infringement problem and protect their works in the digital form. The use of intellectual property conventions (not just copyright practices) to protect digital works is accelerating.Weber, Steven: ePublish: , page 18. Weber Books, 2009. Distribution Digital micropublishing sites like Scribd and Docstoc enable micro-publishers to easily distribute their digital works using intellectual property licenses. Licensing micro-publications simplifies protecting and tracking those works which are distributed digitally, an approached used for many years by software producers, and in the last decade by MP3 music distributors.Chandler, Stephanie: The Author's Guide to Building an On-line Platform: , page 22. Quill Driver Books/Word Dancer Price, Inc., 2008. Micro-publishers and authors who use intellectual property licensing sites are not limited to a specific medium (like eReaders) to distribute their works. This flexibility may allow micropublishing to significantly expand readership while protecting copyrights.  Notes   References  *Idris, Kamil (2003).

Fifth Avenue (sometimes spelled 5th Avenue) is one of the longest streets in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It begins downtown and moves eastward for over five miles (9 km). Fifth Avenue passes by the Carlow University, the Cathedral of Learning and other buildings of the University of Pittsburgh, then forms the borders between Shadyside on the north and Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze to the south. Finally, after passing Chatham University, The Ellis School, and Mellon Park, it turns north and forms the border between Larimer on the west and North Point Breeze and Homewood (Pittsburgh) on the east. At the intersection with Frankstown Avenue its name becomes Washington Boulevard (PA 8) and descends a branch of Negley Run to meet Allegheny River Boulevard (PA 130) near the Highland Park Bridge. At least 30 streets either cross or intersect with Fifth Avenue, including Penn Avenue, which intersects it twice (once in Downtown and again near Point Breeze). Forbes Avenue parallels it from Downtown through Uptown and Oakland before diverging at the University of Pittsburgh; they form a one-way pair through Uptown and Oakland (Forbes from Downtown toward Oakland, Fifth from Oakland toward Downtown).

Councilman Greer graduated from Cameron High School in 1969, attended Tennessee State University from 1969 to 1971, and went to Fisk University for three years. He ran for councilman-at-large, but failed to gain a seat, having placed sixth in the run-off election. Political views At a forum for at-large candidates on August 28, 2007, Ronnie Greer said he would improve the Metro school system by increasing vocational course offerings. After a window was added to the Metro Council's \\"back room\\" in November 2003, Councilman Greer started a petition to put the wood doors back in place, on the grounds that council members should have \\"some degree of separation from the public as we go back and forth to the restrooms, to get a beverage, etc.\\" Ronnie Greer proposed a dog excrement bill that would prohibit dog excrement from public and private property, which would fine $50 those that fail to clean up after their dogs. The bill later became law. Ronnie Greer voted for Sylvan Park historic zoning, for a Westin Hotel on Lower Broadway, for Lower Broadway historic zoning, and for rezoning Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center. Ronnie Greer voted to increase Metro Council members' salary from $6,900 to $15,000, to increase the vice mayor's salary from $8,900 to $17,000, and to increase the mayor's salary from $75,000 to $136,500. Ronnie Greer proposed a donation of $5,000 in city monies to the Nashville Inner City Ministry, a nonprofit organization that teaches life skills classes to inner-city children aged 4–18, but the Metro Law Department stated that his proposal could violate the separation of church and state Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Controversies Ronnie Greer was cited for violating property standards laws by keeping two non- working automobiles in his driveway for years, and he was ordered to appear in court because he hadn't addressed the problem 30 days after the citation.

While they originally played speed and power metal, after recruiting drummer Tetsu and vocalist Kyo they switched to an alternative rock sound for their debut album La Vie En Rose in 1989. Although it was on an indie label, it sold out and was reissued three times that year, earning them a major label record deal with BMG Japan the following year. They released Basilisk in March 1990 and it reached the top five on the charts. However, in December the group suddenly announced their disbandment. Despite their short time in the spotlight, they remain well-known and are considered one of the founders of visual kei. D'erlanger reunited in 2007 and released the album Lazzaro, with a new harder sound that adds a gothic rock feel. They have since released six more studio albums and toured extensively, including several overseas performances. History =Formation to disbandment: 1983–1990= D'erlanger was formed in December 1983 by Cipher and Seela on guitar and bass respectively. Vocalist Kaoru and drummer Shi-Do, from the same high school, soon joined to complete the line-up. They had their first performance in May 1984 at the Osaka Bourbon House, when Cipher was just fifteen years old. In August 1984, Kaoru left the band and was replaced by Dizzy. They released 3 demo tapes by 1985, \\"Tonight\\", \\"The Birth of Splendid Beast!!\\" and \\"Blue\\". On October 26, 1986 they participated in an event at Meguro Rokumeikan, called The New Power Metal Audition. Which was organized by Mandrake Root Records to celebrate the first anniversary of the independent label. D'erlanger won the contest and the label released their single \\"Girl\\" on February 20, 1987, it was limited to 3000 copies. They also appeared on the live omnibus album Hungry Days, with the song \\"Like a Beast\\". They then distributed another demo tape for free on February 22, it contained only \\"Sadistic Emotion\\". On August 1, 1987, D'erlanger had their first one-man concert at Meguro Rokumeikan. Soon after Shi-Do decided to leave the band, he was replaced by Tetsu, who was a roadie for 44Magnum alongside Cipher, in October. Dizzy then left the band in June 1988 and Kyo, who had previously played with Tetsu in the short-lived Dead Wire and in Saver Tiger, became their new vocalist on July 1. Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall, where D'erlanger performed what became their penultimate concerts in 1990. After their first show with Kyo on July 22, they went on their Sadistical Punk Tour. While touring in 1989, they released their first album La Vie En Rose, with Danger Crue Records on February 10. All copies were sold out just by pre-orders, so they released another press eleven days later. The album's sound was a drastic departure from their previous material, being punk and alternative rock instead of the speed and power metal they originally had. The band then went on the short Incarnation of Eroticism Tour. The year 1990 started off with the band signing to the major label Ariola, at the time a sub label of BMG. During their Ai to Shi to Koh-Kotsu Tour at the beginning of 1990, they released their first major single, \\"Darlin'\\" on January 25. On March 7, they released their second album Basilisk. They released the single \\"Lullaby -1990-\\" before starting the Moon and the Memories Tour on September 10. The tour ended on October 31, at Koseinenkin Kaikan in Osaka. On December 24, 1990, D'erlanger shocked their fans by suddenly announcing that they had disbanded. A home video and two separate live albums entitled Moon and the Memories... the Eternities Last Live 1 and 2 were released on March 6, 1991. All of which were recorded from their penultimate concerts on October 27 and 28, 1990 at Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall in Tokyo. On April 21, 1995, both their studio albums were remastered and re-released. =Reunited: 2007–2012= On March 14, 2007, the greatest hits album and DVD Pandora was released. Also released that same day on Cutting Edge, a sub label of Avex Group, was D'erlanger's first release of new material in 17 years, their third album Lazzaro.

It was originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and is currently maintained by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters). Background and history A citation index is built on the fact that citations in science serve as linkages between similar research items, and lead to matching or related scientific literature, such as journal articles, conference proceedings, abstracts, etc. In addition, literature which shows the greatest impact in a particular field, or more than one discipline, can be easily located through a citation index. For example, a paper's influence can be determined by linking to all the papers that have cited it. In this way, current trends, patterns, and emerging fields of research can be assessed.

This is accomplished because of the creation of a common vocabulary, called ontology, for varied search terms and varied data. Moreover, search terms generate related information across categories. Acceptable content for Web of Science is determined by an evaluation and selection process based on the following criteria: impact, influence, timeliness, peer review, and geographic representation. Web of Science employs various search and analysis capabilities. First, citation indexing is employed, which is enhanced by the capability to search for results across disciplines. The influence, impact, history, and methodology of an idea can be followed from its first instance, notice, or referral to the present day. This technology points to a deficiency with the keyword-only method of searching. Second, subtle trends and patterns relevant to the literature or research of interest, become apparent. Broad trends indicate significant topics of the day, as well as the history relevant to both the work at hand, and particular areas of study. Third, trends can be graphically represented.Overview and Description. ISI Web of Knowledge. Thomson Reuters. 2010. Accessed on 2010-06-24 Coverage Entering a search query on Web of Science.

One may use them to undertake cited reference search, that is, locating articles that cite an earlier, or current publication. One may search citation databases by topic, by author, by source title, and by location. Two chemistry databases, Index Chemicus and Current Chemical Reactions allow for the creation of structure drawings, thus enabling users to locate chemical compounds and reactions. =Abstracting and indexing= The following types of literature are indexed: scholarly books, peer reviewed journals, original research articles, reviews, editorials, chronologies, abstracts, as well as other items. Disciplines included in this index are agriculture, biological sciences, engineering, medical and life sciences, physical and chemical sciences, anthropology, law, library sciences, architecture, dance, music, film, and theater. Seven citation databases encompasses coverage of the above disciplines. Limitations in the use of citation analysis As with other scientific approaches, scientometrics and bibliometrics have their own limitations. In 2010, a criticism was voiced pointing toward certain deficiencies of the journal impact factor (JIF) calculation process, based on Thomson Reuters Web of Science, such as: journal citation distributions usually are highly skewed towards established journals; journal impact factor properties are field- specific and can be easily manipulated by editors, or even by changing the editorial policies; this makes the entire process essentially non- transparent.San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment: Putting science into the assessment of research, December 16, 2012 Regarding the more objective journal metrics, there is a growing view that for greater accuracy it must be supplemented with article-level metrics and peer-review. Thomson Reuters replied to criticism in general terms by stating that \\"no one metric can fully capture the complex contributions scholars make to their disciplines, and many forms of scholarly achievement should be considered.\\"Thomson Reuters Statement Regarding the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment  See also  * CSA databases * Dialog (online database) * Energy Citations Database * Energy Science and Technology Database * ETDEWEB * Google Scholar * h-index * J-Gate * List of academic journal search engines * Materials Science Citation Index * PASCAL database * PubMed Central * Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale * ResearchGate * SciELO * Scopus * SCImago Journal Rank * Serbian Citation Index * Russian Science Citation Index * Indian Citation Index * Chinese Science Citation Database * Korea Citation Index * VINITI Database RAS  References  External links * About Web of Science * Web of Science * Searching the Citation Indexes (Web of Science) Harvard College Library. 2010.

Once identified, microsegments can become the focus of personalized direct micromarketing campaigns, each campaign is meant to target and appeal to the specified tastes, needs, wants, and desires of the small groups and individuals that make up the microsegment. The goal of microsegments is to determine, which marketing actions will have the most impact on each set of customers. Overview Microsegments aim to limit customers into very small segments or even as individuals. This helps modern marketers to determine exactly what the customer wants at every level. Microsegments usually contain very few customers each that allows predictive analysis and marketing action. Microsegments help marketers target their audience needs more specifically. This can be done through a combination of techniques and technology such as artificial intelligence, algorithms and data mining. Therefore, artificial intelligence, algorithms and data mining assist sections that contain behavioral and demographic attributes through special offerings and product categories, lifecycle stage of the customer and lastly segment based on recency and frequency. It is important to state that microsegment is a rather new concept in terms of other marketing techniques but it is the future of how a business will look to have different customer target groups and bases such as the handset manufacturers and mobile operators. Mobile phones are now very common and almost every person in different age bracket has it, however with so many types of different customers come along different wants and needs so microsegments are key for handset manufacturers and mobile operators to produce a different kind of mobile phone for every microsegment. Traditional market segmentation Traditional market segmentation divides the market into four categories of geographic segmentation, demographic segmentation, psychographic segmentation and behavioral segmentation. This approach works well as it groups various customers into segments that have common needs. It would lead to targeting the segment and positioning the product. However, as technology is advancing there are more resources for businesses to get almost all of its customer data and segment the market that is leading towards microsegment as the future. Benefits Microsegment breaks down almost all of the customer needs and helps pitch a product that relates specifically to a very finite number of customers or individuals. Identifying smaller groups of customers is now easier and more cost effective due to technological advances. Marketing could direct specific marketing actions towards each microsegment to maximize the effectiveness of each customer. Microsegment maximizes the usage of data available leading to a product or service that satisfies the requirement of the customer. In addition, it helps penetrate the market niche to a greater extent. Penetrating the market niche not only increases market share but also leads to brand loyalty. Micro-segments are critical to the success of any modern marketing campaign. Marketers can create advanced user micro-segments on the basis of user’s personal and behavioural data. Factors like purchase and search intent, user location, search and purchase timings etc. can be used to create targeted micro-segments and leverage them effectively in marketing automation campaigns. Vaidhyanathan's 2018 book on Antisocial media describes how social media, especially Facebook, have become particularly adept at identifying microsegments of the body politic and driving them into fear, loathing, hatred and violence against others, thereby \\"Disconnecting Us and Undermining Democracy.\\" Limitations There are a number of reasons why microsegments can be ineffective. The limitations surrounding microsegments are if the business does not have enough resources it cannot reach or serve the customers profitably or the resources could be used but will not be able to meet the needs of the rest of the customers, Another limitation for microsegments could be if the customers targeted by the specific microsegments do not produce the advantages other segments do in the form of longevity or other sources of revenue.

It is located in the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region, at the place where the Enguri River flows into the Black Sea, near the border with Abkhazia.  History  The earliest settlement on Anaklia's territory dates back to the mid-Bronze Age and is typical to the Colchian culture. It is the Classical Heraclea of Colchis, Anaclia of later authors, and Anarghia of Archangelo Lamberti and Jean Chardin (both the 17th-century travelers). After the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 15th century, it was an important fortified town, sea port and fishing station within the Principality of Mingrelia.W.E.D. Allen. Two Georgian Maps of the First Half of the Eighteenth Century. Imago Mundi, Vol. 10, 1953 (1953), pp. 99-121. In 1723, the town was captured by the Ottoman Empire and converted into its maritime outpost and slave-trading locale. Western Georgian kingdom of Imereti regained control over Anaklia in 1770, seizing the opportunity of Ottoman Empire being at war with Russia (Russo- Turkish War (1768–1774)). Solomon I, the king of Imereti, was supposed to be supported in this endeavor by a small Russian contingent under General Totleben, but the Russian troops retreated before a clash against the Turks. In 1802, Kelesh-Bey Sharvashidze, the pro-Turkish ruler of the neighboring Principality of Abkhazia, capitalized on the internecine feuds in Mingrelia, and forced Prince Grigol Dadiani of Mingrelia into surrendering Anaklia, taking Grigol’s son and heir, Levan, as a hostage. When Mingrelia accepted the Russian protectorate in 1803, the Russian commander in Georgia, Prince Tsitsianov, demanded that Kelesh-Bey release Levan. On his refusal, Tsitsianov sent Major General Ion Rykgof into Abkhazia. In March 1805, the Russians took hold of Anaklia and threatened to march against Sukhum-Kaleh, forcing the Abkhazian prince to release Dadiani. The capture of Anaklia drew an Ottoman protest, however, and Tsitsianov hastened to disavow his subordinate and even apologize for his action, removing a Russian garrison from Anaklia.John F. Baddeley (1908), The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus, p. 67. London: Longmans, Green and Co. (Republished 1999, Routledge). However, the incident added to an increasing tension between the two empires. When the next Russo- Turkish War broke out in 1806, the Russian forces restored Redoubt Kali and Anaklia to the Mingrelian prince Levan who would later relinquish the control of these forts to the Russian administration. (See Russian conquest of the Caucasus#Black Sea Coast.) In the 1850s, Anaklia was a small but strongly fortified seaport, which had a custom-house and carried on a considerable trade with Turkey. It had extensive suburbs, consisting of detached houses inhabited by Greeks, Jews, and Armenians. The population was around 600.Royal Geographical Society (1856) \\"Anaklia\\" A Gazetteer of the World: or, Dictionary of geographical knowledge, compiled from the most recent authorities, and forming a complete body of modern geography – physical, political, statistical, historical, and ethnographical. A. Fullarton and Co, Edinburgh, Scotland, p. 242, OCLC 20348227. Subsequently, the importance of the Anaklia port significantly reduced, but it remained a minor Black Sea Fleet base in the Soviet times. After the War in Abkhazia (1992–93), a Russian peacekeeping post was opened at Anaklia in 1994. In 2006, the Ministry of Defense of Georgia reported numerous damages inflicted by the Russian soldiers upon the 17th-century fortress of Anaklia and accused the peacekeepers of installing latrines and baths within the walls of the fort. Following a series of protests by the Georgians, the Russian military post was withdrawn in July 2007. Грузия выселила российских солдат из древней крепости. Lenta.Ru. July 13, 2007. A monument has been erected in Anaklia on May 21, 2012, commemorating Russia's expulsion of the Circassian people from the region following the conclusion of the Caucasian War in the 1860s. The May 21 date was chosen to coincide with the day on which the Circassian people themselves commemorate the expulsion, which the Georgian government has recognized as an act of genocide. The monument was designed by Khusen Kochesokov, a sculptor from the North Caucasus region of Kabardino-Balkaria.  Resort Anaklia is the seaside resort. Some of the greatest hotels were built in this village. The resort is connected with the village Ganmukhuri with the help of 552-metre flying bridge. Kazantip, the electronic music festival was held in Anaklia in 2014, but it was cancelled and GEM Fest electronic music festival has been taking place here since 2015.  Location  Anaklia is a new resort, located on the southeastern coast of the Black Sea, on the left side of the Enguri River where it flows into the Black Sea, in the central part of the Colchis lowland. Coast of Anaklia is about 8 km in length, and in the distance of more than 1 km, there’s the resort promenade, and some comfortable hotels are placed along it. At the western end of the promenade begins the 540-meter pedestrian bridge that connects the resort to the village Ganmukhuri, located on the opposite side of the Enguri River. In the north the nearest neighbors of Anaklia are the towns of Gali, Ochamchire and Sokhumi, and in the south of it – Poti, Kobuleti and Batumi. Anaklia is the part of Zugdidi district of Georgia, and its center, city of Zugdidi is 30 km away from Anaklia. In Zugdidi there is the palace of princes of Samegrelo – Dadiani, a beautiful park and a museum, which keeps one of the two existing death masks of Napoleon, which belonged to Marshal Murat, who once lived in this palace. Anaklia is located on flat terrain, bordered on the north western spurs of the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range, which can be perfectly viewed in clear weather, directly from the sea coast. The mountains are located at a distance of approximately 40 – 45 km. The area between the mountains and the sea is quite densely populated; there are many villages, whose inhabitants – Megrelians – engaged mainly in agriculture. There is a very fertile soil that, along with a mild climate, creates good conditions for the cultivation of many crops such as tea, citrus, feijoa, filbert, corn and soybeans.  Anaklia Port Project  In 2016, Georgia decided to construct a new deepwater port at Anaklia, in the vicinity of the aborted project of the Lazika city. The new port project was developed by the Anaklia Development Consortium, a joint Georgian–United States venture. The construction began in December 2017. In July 2018, the Dutch marine contractor Van Oord was selected for the early dredging and reclamation works. The Anaklia Port is planned to become operational in December 2020, with a handling capacity of up to 10,000 TEU vessels.

Taxonomy It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus as Lavatera arborea, but was transferred to the genus, Malva, in 1836 by Philip Barker- Webb and Sabin Berthelot. Although long considered a species of Lavatera, genetic and morphological analysis by Martin Forbes Ray, reported in 1998, suggested it was better placed in the genus Malva, in which it was named Malva dendromorpha M.F.Ray.Ray, Martin Forbes.

Habitat Malva arborea tolerates sea water to varying degrees, at up to 100% sea water in its natural habitat, excreting salt through glands on its leaves.Veitch, C. R., and Michael Norman Clout (editors). (2002.) Turning the Tide: The Eradication of Invasive Species: Proceedings of the International Conference on Eradication of Island Invasives.

This salt tolerance can be a competitive advantage over inland plant species in coastal areas. Its level of salinity tolerance is thought to be improved by soil with higher phosphate content, making guano enrichment particularly beneficial. Uses The leaves of the species are used in herbal medicine to treat sprains, by steeping them in hot water and applying the poultice to the affected area.Rippey, Elizabeth and Barbara Rowland.

Thought to have been used as an alternative to toilet paper. The seeds are edible and are known in Jersey as \\"petit pains\\", or \\"little breads\\". Tree mallow was considered a nutritive animal food in Britain in the 19th century, and is still sometimes used as animal fodder in Europe. For human consumption, some sources describe the leaves of tree mallow as edible, although not as palatable as common mallow, unless cut very thinly, because of the very velours-like hairy mouth- feel. Malva arborea has long been cultivated in British gardens, as described in the 1835 self-published book British Phaenogamous Botany, which used the then-common name Sea Tree-mallow: \\"This species is frequently met with in gardens, where, if it is allowed to scatter its seeds, it will spring up for many successive years, and often attain a large size. The young plants will, as Sir J. E. Smith observes, now and then survive one or more mild Winters; but having once blossomed it perishes.\\"Baxter, William. (1835).

Invasive spread Tree mallow seeds may be transported between separated coastal areas by the floating fruit, and seabirds are considered a likely means of spread. The seeds are encased in an impermeable outer case, and can remain viable for years, even after extended immersion in saltwater. The tree mallow's recent increased range among Scottish islands has raised concerns that it is displacing native vegetation, and is reducing Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) populations in affected areas. The plant forms dense stands along the island coasts that inhibit breeding, and causes the puffins to abandon their burrows.McKie, Robin.

Its spread among Australian islands in recent decades is thought to be reducing biodiversity, soil retention, and seabird habitat. According to one study, \\"Crested and Caspian Terns that nest in the open are closed out by the canopy, and Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) and Bridled Terns (Sterna anaethetus) are excluded by the lack of undergrowth\\". In New Zealand it has established on several seabird-dominated islands where it is considered to be a serious ecological weed and for which there are active eradication programmes, such as on North Brother Island in Cook Strait.

PC Magazine Encyclopedia. The 1990s were a golden era for mail-order PC business. Consumers were fed up with high prices for IBM, Compaq and other brand-name PCs sold through dealers so they opted to purchase their computers from a catalog. This was a revolutionary idea at the time, because people wouldn't be able to see or touch their computer before buying it. Aside from Dell and Gateway, popular brands of mail-order PCs were Northgate and Zeos. The company was known for its quality systems and keyboards; in particular, its line of OmniKey keyboards was highly praised. The keyboards were particularly valued for their tactile response and durability, and along with IBM's Model M PC keyboards, were considered some of the best in the industry.Low End Mac Avant Prime: Rebirth of the Legendary Northgate OmniKey Keyboard As such, the company's keyboards were often purchased by users of other manufacturers' PCs.

This station is not the original Bo'ness railway station, which was located roughly a quarter mile west on Seaview Place. The site of the original station is now a car park. Facilities The station has a Booking Office, Station Buffet, a shop and a Visitor Information Point. There is also a large free car park, a bay platform, a footbridge and a trainshed which covers the platforms. This is the eastmost station of the Bo'ness & Kinneil Railway, which is operated by the members and volunteers of the Scottish Railway Preservation Society. The buildings in the station area were brought to Bo'ness in the 1980s, saving each of them from permanent demolition elsewhere. Of these, the trainshed is the most important historically. It was originally built at Edinburgh station, and was the original Edinburgh terminus of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which opened in February 1842. At Haymarket, two similar trainshed bays stood side by side and abutted the two-storey station offices building which still stands today. Haymarket station remained a terminus only until 1846, when the railway was extended partly in tunnel and partly in cutting through Princes Street Gardens to Waverley station. The extension passed by the Haymarket trainshed on its southern side. When traffic through Haymarket increased after the opening of the Forth Bridge, the tracks into Waverley were quadrupled. To make space for these tracks, the southern bay of the original trainshed was demolished. The northern bay remained standing, latterly providing no more than car parking space, until plans for alterations to the station in the 1980s required its removal. As the building was listed, it was carefully removed for re-erection at Bo'ness. This work was managed by Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons. Cast iron columns and arched spans support the trainshed roof, which is slated on wooden sarking in the standard Scottish manner. The roof trusses are of wrought iron tension members and cast iron posts, and all the ironwork is detailed in a light classical style. At Bo'ness, as at Haymarket, there are no smoke ventilators, though smoke troughs have been added to reduce soiling from locomotive exhausts. The station office building at Bo'ness was originally built by the North British Railway at Wormit, on the south shore of the Tay facing Dundee. This station was located on the Tayport branch, close to the end of the Tay Bridge, and opened at the same time as the second bridge, in 1887. Bo'ness signal box is a standard Caledonian Railway structure. It was originally Garnqueen South Junction box, the location where the route of the Caledonian Railway Main Line, heading north, diverged from the route of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway. The footbridge adjacent originally stood at Murthly station, on the Highland Railway main line north of Perth. As a group, the buildings are listed by Historic Scotland in Category A. The stone built goods shed and the Buffet/Shop building housing the Visitor Information Point are modern construction. Being base of the SRPS's many operational fields such as railtours, steam and diesel locomotive restoration and maintenance and facilities for maintenance of the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway itself requires a sizable yard, a diesel MMPD, a steam traction running shed and restoration building (Romney Hut), a coaling stage and water column, a carriage and wagon restoration and storage building and signalling stores among other facilities. A new Display Shed between the MMPD and the carriage and wagon building was erected in 2011 to provide housing for railway artifacts that were previously left out in the open such as the Class 303 EMU \\"Blue Train\\" and the Class 126 Inter-City DMU along with various rolling stock and diesel locomotives which is open for the general public to view the artifacts stored within the shed. A Visitor Trail public walkway from the car park at the southern edge runs along its eastern boundary, to the Display Shed, and continues around past the MMPD and along the northern edge of the site, providing a new disabled-friendly access route to the Museum of Scottish Railways. The walkway also passes a model railway (open to the public on weekdns and bank holidays) housed in two wooden Norwegian carriages, which contains a small village and station, Glenauchter, although this is based on Gleneagles railway station rather than Bo'ness.About the stations, Bo'ness & Kinneil RailwayBo'ness & Kinneil Railway, Gazetteer for ScotlandPhotos: Glenauchter, ScotRail.co.ukAbout the stations, The Scottish Railway Preservation Society References  Scottish Railway Preservation Society * External links * Official website Heritage railway stations in Falkirk (council area) Bo'ness Category A listed buildings in Falkirk (council area) Listed railway stations in Scotland ","title":"Bo'ness railway station"},{"id":"13227721","text":"Brijesh ( ') or Brajesh (ब्रजेश) is an Indian given name.

Early life and education Peter Elbert Brock (named Elbert after his grandfather E. J. Hall, co-designer of the Liberty L-12 engine and co-founder of Hall-Scott Motor Car Company) grew up primarily in the Sausalito area of northern California. When he was 16 years old he saved up to buy a 1949 MG from the back of the shop where he worked. In addition to the work Brock did on the car, he painted it white so the car's livery would match the U.S. international racing colors of blue and white. Brock was first exposed to professional racing when he went to his first road race at Pebble Beach, California in 1951, photographing cars and drivers, including Phil Hill in the 1952 race, but was still too young for a racing driver's license since the SCCA minimum age requirement was 21 at that time. Soon after, his family moved to Menlo Park. He started looking for something faster than his MG and found a half-completed 1946 Ford convertible on a used car lot. He started in on the customization of the Ford, which included converting the livery into the white and blue American racing scheme (white car with two blue stripes down the center). While still in high school, he won the Oakland Roadster show with the car, by then referred to as \\"the Fordillac\\" because of the Cadillac engine Brock had installed. Brock won the show again with the car in 1956, months before he left California for General Motors in Detroit. Upon graduating from high school, he enrolled at Stanford University in the engineering department. He subsequently dropped out, and later drove to Los Angeles to enroll at what was then called the Art Center School, later known as the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. When asked for his portfolio, he had brought no drawings with him, so instead returned to his car, made some drawings of hot rod cars in his ring binder, returned to the admissions office and presented his \\"portfolio\\", and was admitted. Career =General Motors= At age 19, while still attending Art Center School, Brock became the youngest designer ever hired by General Motors' GM Styling design department. In November 1957, Brock drew the sketch (with genesis in the Merrill Powell designed Victress C2) which GM VP of Design Bill Mitchell picked to become the design of the next Corvette, the Corvette Stingray. As GM had made a commitment to not engage in racing (known as the AMA ban) Brock worked with Mitchell in 1958 in one of the design studios, creating the prototype of the Stingray racer. The production car was renamed the Sting Ray and was released in 1963, almost 4 years after Brock had left GM. =Shelby American= Having turned 21, which allowed him to obtain his SCCA race license, Brock left GM in 1959 to return to California. In Detroit he'd been working on a mid-1950s Cooper that had run at Le Mans. Returning to California with the Cooper, he started working for Max Balchowsky at Max's Hollywood Motors shop during the day and worked on his race car at night. In 1961 Carroll Shelby and Paul O'Shea met at Riverside Raceway to discuss opening a driver's school. When Shelby and O'Shea got into a disagreement about who would work for who, O'Shea left. Shelby hired Brock as his first paid employee, running the Carroll Shelby School of High Performance Driving. Brock worked at Shelby American until the end of the 1965 season on the Shelby American brand, creating the logos, merchandise, ads, and car liveries. He designed the Shelby components of the Shelby Mustang GT350s and designed race cars for Shelby such as the Lang Cooper, Nethercutt Mirage, De Tomaso P70 and the Shelby Daytona Cobra coupes that won the FIA GT World Championship in 1965. =Brock Racing Enterprises= In December 1965 Brock started his own design firm and motor racing team, Brock Racing Enterprises (BRE) which worked with Hino, Toyota, and Datsun. GT cars Brock designed for BRE clients included the Hino Samurai, the Toyota JP6 and the Triumph TR-250K. Brock continued racing, now driving his own Lotus 11 MKII and paid rides with a TVR and Mercury in the NASCAR series. Brock began performance development on the Hino 900, which then evolved into their Hino 1300 Contessa. When Toyota took over Hino, Brock designed for them the JP6 Prototype. Toyota planned to give BRE several Toyota 2000GTs for use in Trans-Am racing, but when Toyota instead gave the cars to Carroll Shelby, Brock approached Datsun. BRE became the west coast Datsun factory race team and competed in 1969 in the SCCA DP class with Datsun 2000 roadsters, in 1970 and 1971 in the CP class with the 240Zs (SCCA National Champions '70-'71) and in 1971-72 the 2.5 Trans-Am Series races with the Datsun 510s (National Champions '71-'72). The race team was disbanded at the end of the 1972 season when Brock moved on to hang gliding. =Ultralite Products= Brock founded Ultralite Products, which he built into the largest hang gliding company in the world, and developed the sport of long distance hang gliding competition. He then left the company, citing dissatisfaction with liability laws, and returned to the automotive industry. =Instructor, author and photographer= Brock became an instructor at his alma mater, Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. In the early 1990s he wrote a book on the Daytona Cobra Coupes, then worked for 21 years as a photojournalist, primarily covering endurance racing for automotive magazines. In 2013, he wrote Corvette Sting Ray: Genesis of an American Icon on the development of the 1963 Corvette. In 1999 Brock worked at the Hi-Tech company in Port Elizabeth, South Africa to create a modern version of Daytona Cobra Coupe, called the Brock Coupe. Over 150 Brock Coupes have been produced in South Africa and sold by Superformance, LLC (Superformance Replicars). He owns an example of the coupe (chassis #0073) painted Amulet Red with a Wimbledon White half-cove. =Present= Brock now lives in Henderson, Nevada in the Las Vegas Valley area with his wife Gayle, working together as freelance automotive writers and racing photographers. Brock also continues to design clay models of new automotive designs. In 2008, Brock designed an aerodynamic car trailer called the Aerovault, with aluminum construction. Gayle runs the current day BRE operation which offers memorabilia from the 1960s and 1970s, builds the Aerovault car trailers and offers aftermarket parts and accessories for Datsuns and Daytona Coupe replicas. Awards and recognition In 2010, the International Society for Vehicle Preservation presented Brock with their International Automotive Media Lifetime Achievement Award. Later that same year, the Art Center College of Design awarded Brock their Lifetime Achievement Award for \\"Outstanding accomplishment in the fields of automotive design, technology, innovation, motorsports and journalism\\". In 2012, BRE received a Commendation from the City of Henderson for \\"their contributions to the automobile industry and in appreciation of their community support.\\" Brock, in January 2013, was awarded the Phil Hill Award by the Road Racing Drivers Club (RRDC). The RRDC presents the Phil Hill Award for outstanding service to road racing. Brock was presented the award at the Daytona Speedway by Bobby Rahal. Articles on Brock's career have appeared in Classic Motorsports, Automobile, MotorTrend Classic, Grassroots Motorsports and Car & Driver magazines.

Despite roughly 30 years of use, the only Joes known to exist are unissued remainders from the 1830s. History Dating back to at least 1798, the main unit of monetary exchange in the colonies of Demerara and Essequibo was the Portuguese gold Johannes coin which were valued at 22 Dutch guilders. Exchange rates in the United States in 1797 valued the Portuguese Johannes at $16 (the Spanish doubloon at $14.93, and the English silver shilling at $0.22). Due to clipping and boring (replaced with brass or copper) these coins (colloquially referred to as a Joe) began to lose their intrinsic value. An initial attempt was made to counterstamp or chop mark valid coins. Eventually (1809) the coins were recalled by the authorities and paper currency, denominated in both Guilders and Joes were issued. Issuance The new paper issue of 1809 introduced 50,000 Joes equivalent to 1,100,000 guilders. This was followed by an additional 25,807 Joes in 1815–16, and 24,193 more in 1824 for a total circulation of just under 100,000 Joes. Deemed to be a legal tender, the notes were partially backed by securities in London, though their ability to be redeemed for gold was questionable. By 1837, records indicate that 99,989 Joes had been issued in the following denominations: 1 Joe (13,258 notes), 2 Joes (8,189), 3 Joes (4,201), 5 Joes (3,150), 10 Joes (1,700), and 20 Joes (1,250). By 1839, there had been reference to a half-Joe. Currently known specimen The Standard Catalog of World Paper Money lists only the unissued remainders of the 1830s. The two issues are distinguished by several design features including an ornate D-E in the upper center (first issue) or a woman with an anchor in the upper left (second issue). In addition, the wording of the denomination differs between the series. The first issue lists two denominations: 1 Joe or 22 Guilders and 10 Joes or 220 Guilders; the second issue lists four denominations: 1 Joe of 22 Guilders, 2 Joes of 22 Guilders each, 3 Joes of 22 Guilders each, and 10 Joes of 22 Guilders each.

It is originated 2000 years ago and is composed of a sword dance and drum dance called mugo. Seungjeonmu or Dance of Military Triumph was performed to wish for victory from gods of earth and heaven when the nation was at war. Seungjeonmu is South Korea's Important Intangible Cultural Properties number 21, designated on December 21, 1968. The dance is performed in honor of Admiral Yi Sun shin who gained victory during the Imjin war (1592-1598) of the mid-Joseon dynasty. Origins Seungjeonmu originated between the 1st century BC and 7th century AD. Paintings of seungjeonmu are found in Goguryeo Wall Paintings that were drawn by Korean ancestors of ancient Goguryeo, a kingdom who conquered Northeast Asia. One wall painting called Gamudo draws dancers dancing in a circle while wearing dresses with long sleeves. This is an important ancient record that shows one of the earliest known Korean dances. Seungjeonmu was handed down from Tongyeong, Gyeongsangnamdo. It was performed by women entertainers and dancing boys. Admiral Yi Sun shin had his soldiers dance the drum dance in order to reward them for their labors and raise morale. Originally, all dances performed in military units such as Mugo and sword dance were called dance of victory. But, among them, only Mugo was designated as an important intangible cultural asset in the name of dance of victory. Forms Seungjeonmu is divided into 2 dancing parts. Drum dance and sword dance. The drum dance aroused the fighting spirit of the soldiers as it emulated the sound of their heartbeats. A taeguk pattern, which symbolizes the universe, was drawn on the drum. This symbol contained the wishes of the Korean people who wanted to be prosperous like the wide universe. =Drum dance= Drum dance of Seungjeonmu called Mugo is almost similar to Mugo of the Royal Court in terms of cloths, instruments, and dance steps, because it has the same origin. Begun in the time of King Chungnyeol (1274-1308) of Goryeo dynasty, it spread beyond the court during the Joseon period and was performed at local government ceremonies throughout the country. The type developed at Tongyeong is danced by four colorfully dressed dancers, wearing flower hats. It is performed around large drum which they beat to the accompaniment of an orchestra and their own songs. Sometimes it involves 12 other performers who dance around the four wind directions. =Sword dance= In the sword dance or geommu (hangul: 검무), the sword is used to absorb energy from the heavens and purify the Seungjeonmu ritual. The main purpose of the sword dance is to pray to the gods for victory in an upcoming battle. Two real swords were used in the sword dance and in the climax of the dance, the dancer would expertly twirl the swords in rapid movements. Four women dancers wearing archery cloths and holding Hansam in both hands begin seungjeonmu by beating drums in all directions. It is characterized by 3-advances and 3-retreats and magnificence nimble movements. It uses Samhyeun Dodeuri and Taryeong among Yeongsan Hoisang as accompaniment and has characteristics of unsophisticated and antique steps and movements. Admiral Yi Sun shin's honor Seungjeonmu became a well-known dance when Admiral Yi Sun shin ordered his soldiers to dance the sword dance before engaging with the enemy in the Hansandaecheob naval battle, one of the greatest battles in world history. The dance was meant to uplift the fighting spirit of the soldiers, and the admiral went on to win the battle with his spirited troops. The dances were performed at various ceremonies for some 300 years after the Naval Headquarters of the Three Provinces was instituted. They were also performed at the memorial services held in Admiral Yi's honor in the spring and the autumn, on his birthday and on the anniversary of his death.

Although named after the well-known brand, \\"Flit gun\\" became a generic name for this type of dispenser. Once commonly found in households, hand-operated Flit guns have been replaced by aerosol spray cans and fallen out of common use. Design description A Flit gun consists of a pneumatic pump cylinder with a hand-operated piston to force air through an air nozzle in the front. Below the front of the pneumatic tube hangs a cylindrical container which acts as a reservoir for liquid insecticide, this reservoir being set at 90 degrees to the pneumatic tube. In early versions, the reservoir is permanently secured to the pump and equipped with a removable, gasketed screw cap for filling. In later, improved versions, the insecticide reservoir is secured to the pump with a coarse screw fitting and a seal of cork composite or gasket paper, so that it can readily be unscrewed for filling. A siphon tube extends from the pump cylinder downward into the reservoir and the upper end of the siphon is positioned in front of a nozzle on the air pump. When a jet of high-velocity air exits the pump and streams across end of the siphon tube, it lowers the pressure in the siphon (Bernoulli's principle), drawing insecticide upward from the reservoir, which then atomizes the liquid as it is entrained in the air jet (it is an atomizer nozzle).

He was a president of the American Medical Association, a two-time mayor of Detroit and a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan. Biography =Early life= Dr. Zina Pitcher was born in Sandy Hill, New York on April 12, 1797. He was the son of Nathaniel Pitcher Sr., who died in Sandy Hill, N.Y., 1802, and Margaret Stevenson, who died in Kingsbury, N.Y., in 1819. He was the younger half-brother of Nathaniel Pitcher, a future Governor of New York. (In his 1836 will, Nathaniel mentioned an Osage orange walking stick given to him by Zina.) Another of Zina's brothers was James Pitcher, who became the first mayor of the city of Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1835. Zina attended Middlebury College in Vermont and graduated in medicine in 1822. =Career= Pitcher joined the Army in 1822 as an assistant surgeon, and was promoted to the rank of major in 1836 as a full surgeon. He was president of the Army Medical Board in 1835, and resigned from the Army at the end of 1836. Pitcher was also an excellent botanist (not uncommon for medical professionals of his day). He collected and studied plants in the Great Lakes region, and the exceedingly rare Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcheri) was first collected by him from the Grand Sable Dunes during his service as an Army surgeon; subsequently it was named for him as well. At times Pitcher teamed with botanist Thomas Nuttall. He moved to Detroit, and was elected mayor for two separate terms, once from 1840–1841 and again in 1843. He was also a regent of the University of Michigan from 1837 until 1852. He served as president of the American Medical Association from 1856–1857, presiding over its annual meeting in Detroit. He died in Detroit on April 5, 1872 and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery.

History  OpenSolaris is based on Solaris, which was originally released by Sun Microsystems in 1991. Sun released the bulk of the Solaris system source code in OpenSolaris on 14 June 2005, which made it possible for developers to create other OpenSolaris distributions. Sine Nomine Associates began a project to bring OpenSolaris to the IBM mainframe in July, 2006.IBM Expresses Interest in OpenSolaris for System Z Project The project was named Sirius (in analogy to the Polaris project to port OpenSolaris to PowerPC). In April, 2007, Sine Nomine presented an initial progress report at IBM's System z Technical Expo conference. At the Gartner Data Center Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada in late 2007, Sine Nomine demonstrated OpenSolaris running on IBM System z under z/VM. It was there that David Boyes of Sine Nomine stated that OpenSolaris for System z would be available \\"soon.\\"Open Solaris on System Z demo part III, YouTube Video At the SHARE conference on 13 August 2008, Neale Ferguson of Sine Nomine Associates presented an update on the progress of OpenSolaris for System z. This presentation included a working demonstration of OpenSolaris for System z. During this presentation he stated that while OpenSolaris is \\"not ready for prime-time\\" they hoped to have a version available to the public for testing \\"in a matter of weeks rather than months.\\" In October, 2008, Sine Nomine Associates released the first \\"prototype\\" (it lacks a number of features such as DTrace, Solaris Containers and the ability to act as an NFS server) of OpenSolaris for System z to the public. OpenSolaris for System z has a project page at OpenSolaris.org. OpenSolaris for System z is available for download at no charge, and is governed by the same open source license terms as OpenSolaris for other platforms. All source code is available; there are no OCO (object code only) modules. The port uses z/Architecture 64-bit addressing and therefore requires an IBM System z mainframe. Because the port depends on recently defined z/Architecture processor instructions, it requires a System z9 or later mainframe model and will not run on older machines. It also will not run on the release version of Hercules mainframe emulator, the needed changes are included in the SVN version 5470 of Hercules. It also requires the paravirtualization features provided by z/VM; it will not run on \\"bare metal\\" or in a logical partition (LPAR) without the z/VM hypervisor at Version 5.3 level or later. Also, because OpenSolaris uses a new network DIAGNOSE instruction, PTF VM64466 or VM64471 must be applied to z/VM to provide support for that instruction. On 18 November 2008, IBM authorized the use of IFL processors to run OpenSolaris for System z workloads.

The flood occurred due to higher than average rainfalls in Western Queensland and heavy rains in the proceeding three months in the Murray-Darling basin. Flood waters moved down the Murray and Darling rivers for seven months and peaked between 11 and 14 August at Merbein in Victoria and at Morgan in South Australia. Some areas were flooded up to from the natural flow of the river. The flood was and still is considered the biggest flood in the recorded history of the Murray and described as \\"the greatest catastrophe in South Australia's history\\", in spite of no lives being lost. From upstream to downstream, flooding occurred in the towns of Wentworth in New South Wales; Colignan, Iraak, Mildura, Nangiloc, and Red Cliffs in Victoria; and Mannum, Murray Bridge, and Renmark to store high flows from the Darling River.

Additional markers are to be erected at various locations along the river from Wentworth to Colignan. Several towns in South Australia also have depth markers showing how high the floodwaters rose. =Wentworth, New South Wales= The town of Wentworth, located on the junction of the Darling and Murray Rivers, erected a statue in 1959 in honour of the Fergie TE20 tractor, responsible for helping to erect a levee around the town which kept floodwaters at bay for months. A tractor rally is also held every five years to celebrate the Fergie.

After meeting Sabine Baring-Gould she became involved with folk music and joined the Editorial Board of the Folk-Song Society in 1906. She had an unusually good memory for hymn tunes, one of her areas of expertise. Gilchrist is a neglected figure because she did not write any books.

In the very first edition of the Journal of the Folk-Song Society she wrote an article on the song Long Lankin. She reports that a woman in Northumberland used to frighten children by shouting \\"There's Long Lankin\\". Gilchrist collected songs from Scotland and the north-west of England. This was particularly valuable, as few folk-song collections had been made from that part of England.

Its defining feature is the multi- storey \\"lantern-shaped\\" construct holding the main meeting rooms; a representation of which has been adopted by both the European Council and Council of the EU as their official emblems. The Europa building is situated on the former site of the partially demolished and renovated Bloc A of the Résidence Palace. Its exterior combines the listed Art Deco façade of the original 1920s building with the contemporary design of architect Philippe Samyn. The building is linked via two skyways and a service tunnel to the adjacent Justus Lipsius building, which provides for additional office space, meeting rooms and press facilities. History = Construction and former usage: the Résidence Palace = Following the end of the First World War, Walloon businessman Lucien Kaisin, in collaboration with Swiss architect, Michel Polak, put forward plans for a complex of luxurious apartment blocks for the bourgeoisie and aristocracy, the Résidence Palace, to be situated on the edge of Brussels' Leopold Quarter. Consisting of five Blocs (A - E), it was to be \\"a small town within a city\\" able to provide its residents with onsite facilities, including a theatre hall, a swimming pool, as well as other commercial services such as a restaurants and hairdressers.RÉSIDENCE PALACE Project Factsheet, Council of the European Union The Résidence Palace aimed to address the dual shortage of suitable property and domestic workers for the upper classes following the destruction brought about during the war. The foundation stone of the Art Deco building was laid on 30 May 1923 with the first residents moving in 1927. The development, however, only had a short commercial success. In 1940 tenants were forced to leave, as the building was requisitioned as the headquarters of the occupying German army during the Nazi occupation of Belgium during the Second World War. In September 1944, after the liberation of Brussels, the building was taken over as headquarters for SHAEF and RAF Second Tactical Air Force. After the War, in 1947, the Belgian government bought the complex and used Bloc A (the north-east L-shaped building) for administrative offices.NEW HEADQUARTERS OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Samyn and Partners At the end of the 1960s, as part of work to modernise the area during the construction of an underground railway line beneath Rue de la Loi, a new aluminium façade was built, closing the L-shape, under the supervision of Michel Polak's sons. = Development of the European Quarter = With the development of the European Quarter in Brussels, city planners struggled to find suitable office space to house the growing staff and needs of the European Union institutions situated in close proximity to the Résidence Palace. In 1988, the eastern part of the Résidence Palace, Blocs D and E were demolished to make way for the construction of the Justus Lipsius building as the seat of the Council of the European Union. In 2002, the European Council, the organisation gathering the EU's Heads of State/Government together, also began using the Justus Lipsius building as their Brussels venue. This followed an advanced implementation of a decision by European leaders during ratification of the Nice Treaty to do so at such a time as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. Prior to this, the venue for European Council summits was in the member state that held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The resulting growing international media presence in the area led the Belgian Federal Government to develop Blocs C and B as the site of its new International Press Centre. A swimming pool and theatre were also maintained. However, in 2004 leaders decided the logistical problems created by the outdated facilities warranted the construction of a new purpose built seat able to cope with the nearly 6,000 meetings, working groups, and summits per year. This being despite a number of renovations to the Justus Lipsius building, including the conversion of an underground carpark into additional meeting rooms. The Belgian government proposed as a solution the conversion of Bloc A of the Résidence Palace into a new permanent seat for both EU institutions. Under the deal, the site would be transferred from the Belgian government to the Council's Secretariat for the symbolic price of €1, with the Council assuming the costs for the subsequent construction project.Pop, Valentina (14 September 2009) Top EU institution to move into eco-friendly building, EU Observer = Transformation of Bloc A into the Europa building = A pan-European competition was opened to redesign Bloc A of the Résidence Palace to suit the needs of the institutions. As the original Art Deco façades of the Résidence Palace building were listed as historic monuments, competition rules stated that these had to be retained. In 2005, it was announced that a team involving Belgian architect Philippe Samyn and Partners (architects and engineers), lead and design partner, in collaboration with Studio Valle Progettazioni (architects), and Buro Happold (engineers) had succeeded in submitting the winning design. The design for what was to be later named the Europa building, involved the demolition of the 1960s extension, and the construction of a large glass-cubed atrium connecting the two renovated wings of the original 1920s L-shaped building. Within the atrium was to be constructed a \\"lantern-shaped\\" structure housing the main meeting rooms where the EU's delegations to the European Council and Council of the EU would meet. Council of the European Union, Factsheet on the EUROPA building 7 December 2016. Due to EU leaders desire for the building to be eco-friendly, the design was adapted to include solar panels on the roof and recycle rain water. Construction work on the Europa building began in 2007, with the building originally planned to be finished and inaugurated by 2012.Result of the architectural competition for the restructuring of block A of the Résidence Palace Building for use by the European Council, Council of the European Union However, due to setbacks and modifications to the design following the evolution of the European Council's needs as an institution during the Lisbon Treaty reforms, the building was completed in December 2016. Features Main meeting room in the Europa building featuring colour compositions designed by Georges Meurant. A defining characteristic of the Europa building is the use of striking colour compositions designed by the Belgian painter Georges Meurant. Lead architect, Philipe Samyn, wished to break with the visual \\"uniformity\\" of other EU buildings, believing that the EU was \\"not being served well by its blue flag with its 12 stars\\". Further he believed it \\"too bland an image of the multiple institutional, social, cultural constellations that structure European conscience\\". Samyn, inspired by the boldness of Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas' 2002 \\"barcode\\" flag, commissioned Meurant to reflect the national heraldic symbols and flags, of the 28 member states in their diverse proportions and colours. Meurant's orthogonal polychrome grid designs appear over ceilings in meeting rooms, doors, carpet flooring in conference rooms as well as in the corridors, press room, catering facilities and elevators. Samyn and Meurant saw this as a way to not only bring more light and a warmer atmosphere into the building, and particular in the meeting rooms, which for security reasons had to remain windowless, but also to create a visual message, of \\"permanent creative effort and political debate\\" befitting a polyglottic diverse Union.

Broadcasting in Northern Ireland is a reserved matter and as such it is the responsibility of the United Kingdom's Department of Culture, Media and Sport and Office of Communications (Ofcom). Media development and production is supported by various organisations including the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland Screen.  Film  Northern Ireland Screen is the national screen agency purposed with promoting the development of a sustainable film, animation and television production industry in the province.  Internet  Several media groups, such as Independent News & Media have \\"digital\\" departments selling their own online advertising, while Green Beans Media represents a number of smaller independent publishers with Northern Ireland audiences.  Print  In Northern Ireland, the main newspapers are The Irish News, seen as pro-Social Democratic and Labour Party, and the Unionist-leaning Belfast Newsletter. The Belfast Telegraph is the main evening newspaper in Northern Ireland. In January 2005 Daily Ireland, which was somewhat supportive of Sinn Féin was launched. It contended (in line with its politics) to be an all-Ireland newspaper, however its sales were far stronger in Northern Ireland and Dublin than the rest of the island, and it closed in September 2006. Magazines include Fortnight, a monthly political and cultural magazine. The Ulster Tatler is a lifestyle and society magazine, alongside sister publications Ulster Homes and Ulster Bride. Regional newspapers are also published by Alpha Newspaper Group, Belfast Media Group, Johnston Publishing, North West of Ireland Printing and Publishing Company and others. Opinion on Northern Ireland is as diverse as that in the general public, ranging from the strongly anti-Republican line of the Sunday Independent to the more sympathetic Sunday Business Post.  Broadcasting  Broadcasting in Northern Ireland is governed under United Kingdom law. The British Broadcasting Corporation operates a national region in Northern Ireland, known as BBC Northern Ireland, and one member of the BBC Trust is designated Trustee for Northern Ireland. The Office of Communications regulates the commercial broadcasting sector in Northern Ireland.  Radio  : Radio stations in Northern Ireland The first radio station to broadcast in Northern Ireland was 2BE Belfast, owned by the then British Broadcasting Company. Today, Northern Ireland has two national radio stations: BBC Radio Ulster, operated by the BBC, and the Ofcom-licensed Downtown Radio. The BBC also operates a local radio station in Derry, BBC Radio Foyle. A number of local commercial radio stations (licensed by Ofcom) are also broadcast, including Q101.2 FM West in Omagh, Q102 in Derry and Cool FM- based in Newtownards and Belfast CityBeat 96.7 and 102.5 FM (Part of the CN Group) in Belfast. The five UK wide BBC Radio radio stations, as well as the three UK-wide Ofcom radio services (Classic FM, TalkSport, and Virgin Radio) are also available in Northern Ireland. Independent radio includes Downtown Radio and Cool FM owned by Bauer Radio. The Alpha Newspaper Group operates six radio stations throughout Northern Ireland. Wireless Group owns the Greater Belfast station U105. There are also numerous part-time and community based stations throughout Northern Ireland. Analogue television : Northern Irish Television The BBC began broadcasting television programmes in Northern Ireland in 1953. This was the first regular television broadcast station in Ireland. In 1959 Ulster Television (now known as UTV) began broadcasting as part of the ITV Network. Northern Ireland currently has three analogue terrestrial channels: BBC One Northern Ireland, BBC Two Northern Ireland – both operated by BBC Northern Ireland – and UTV, the latter being the Office of Communications Channel 3 licensee for Northern Ireland, and thus part of the UK ITV network. Today BBC Northern Ireland operates two television channels with local content, BBC One and BBC Two. ITV plc still operates the same \\"ITV Ulster\\" licence. Channel 4 has broadcast to Northern Ireland since 1982 but (apart from advertisements) does not broadcast Northern Ireland-specific programming. As part of the Belfast Agreement the Republic of Ireland's Irish language television station TG4 has begun transmitting from a limited number of locations in Northern Ireland. To date, Ofcom has licensed two local television channels. The first, C9TV (Channel 9 Television), started in 1999 and broadcasts to Derry and the surrounding districts of Limavady, Coleraine and Strabane. In Belfast, NvTv (Northern Visions Television) started in 2004.  Digital terrestrial television  In Northern Ireland, the UK's Freeview service is the DTT provider. A significant amount of terrestrial transmission overspill exists between transmissions from north and south of the Irish border, with a large portion of the population of Northern Ireland currently able to receive digital terrestrial television and analogue television broadcasts from the Republic, and many in the Border Region of the Republic and beyond able to receive UK Freeview transmissions from North of the border.

Murray (a.k.a. Valgard Murray) of Arizona, a former vice-president of Else Christensen's Odinist Fellowship. The establishment of the Alliance, as well as the establishment of The Troth, followed the disbanding of the Asatru Free Assembly (\\"old AFA\\") in 1986. The Ásatrú Alliance largely reconstituted the old AFA, dominated by prior AFA members, and acting as a distributor of previously AFA publications. Background Stephen McNallen founded the Asatru Folk Assembly (\\"new AFA\\") in 1994 as the successor organization to the Asatru Free Assembly. The Alliance and the Folk Assembly organizations have existed in parallel since, temporarily united within the International Asatru-Odinic Alliance (1997–2002). Gardell (2003) classifies the AA as folkish. The AA defines Ásatrú as \\"the ethnic religion of the Northern European peoples\\". The Ásatrú Alliance is recognized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit religious organization, or church. The AA was formed on June 19, 1988 by seven kindreds, which were members of the disbanded Ásatrú Free Assembly, who ratified on this day a set of by-laws to preserve and promote the beliefs of Ásatrú in the United States of America. The Ásatrú Alliance promotes ethnonationalism in the guise of a return to the religion of the ancient Scandinavians, which the organization's website describes as merely one form of what is essentially a pan-European native religion. The website makes the explicitly racist claim that Ásatrú is the only suitable religion for the descendants of ancient Europeans––i.e. Caucasians––and is by the same token unsuitable for people of any other ethnic background, who are described as \\"essentially different from\\" people of European ancestry. The AA is currently headed by a board of directors composed of representatives appointed by their kindred, to speak on their behalf for any AA business. The AA held its 32nd annual Althing gathering in September 2012. Kaplan (1996) estimates the AA has between 500 and 1,000 members. As a definition of Ásatrú, AA cites a 1995 essay by McNallen on \\"what is Ásatrú\\", which concludes by summarizing the main goals as the practice of \\"courage, honor, the importance of the family and ancestral bonds, strength, freedom, the preservation of our kind, and joyful, vigorous life.\\" World Tree Publications is the Ásatrú Alliance's publishing house.

At the age of four, Valgard was burned on over thirty percent of his body. By the age of eleven, he would have a vision which we would later recognize as Oðinn on Sleipner leading the Wild Hunt. Six years later, he would meet a woman who would introduce him to a group of Northern Folk who kept the old ways. This group would eventually become the Arizona Kindred of Ásatrú Inc.

He has also been the spokesperson for the Arizona-based National Socialist outlaw brotherhood Iron Cross MC.Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism, page 262 In the early 70's Murray and Hall formed a kindred and made contact with Else Christensen. In 1976 the Arizona Kindred became the first kindred certified as such by the Odinist Fellowship, which until then had only individual members. Murray worked with Else Christensen to found the Odinist Fellowship, and served as vice president. Between 1984 and 1987 he was a representative of the AA,Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism, page 263 and was on the board of the International Ásatrú-Odinic Alliance (IAOA), and chosen the first honorary IAOA Allsherjargoði for the three-year period.

It was subsequently published as a species in its own right by Joseph Maiden and Ernst Betche in A Census of New South Wales Plants in 1916. Distribution and habitat Narrow-leaved phebelium grows in eucalypt woodland, heath or mallee in disjunct populations in the central and southern tablelands of New South Wales and near the Victorian- South Australian border. It has also been recorded from Mt Zero and Mt Abrupt in the Grampians National Park and from near Blackwood. Use in horticulture Phebalium stenophyllum is cultivated as an ornamental flowering shrub. The species has some frost tolerance and performs best in a well- drained, partially shaded position. Established plants can withstand dry periods.

The club dates back to 1858 when the first recorded cricket match was played between a team of British naval officers and a Shanghai XI. The original Shanghai Cricket Club ceased activities in 1948. Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, a new Shanghai Cricket Club (with a different Chinese name) was established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. History =Before 1949= Shanghai map from 1933, the ground in the racecourse is shown on the left in green. The first recorded cricket match in Shanghai was played somewhere in Hongkou on April 22, 1858, between a team of officers from and a Shanghai XI in 1858. Since then cricket has had a home in Shanghai. In 1863, the first true cricket ground was bought by the Shanghai Recreation Fund from the Race Club. The ground was located inside the Shanghai Race Club racecourse, located in present-day People's Square and People's Park on the corner of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road. Interport matches with the Hong Kong Cricket Club and the Singapore Cricket Club began in 1866 as a series of home- and-away fixtures which continued up until 1948, just prior to the PLA takeover of Shanghai. It was after the conclusion of one of these series that the Hong Kong team, returning from Shanghai was struck by tragedy as the , the ship that was transporting them back to Hong Kong, sank on October 10, 1892, off the coast of Formosa. Of the 13 Hong Kong cricketers on board, only two survived. The clubs continued to play Interport matches and today, the winner of a series is given the Bokhara Bell Memorial Trophy. =Reincarnation= The Shanghai Cricket Club was reestablished in 1994, under the same English name as the original club but a different Chinese name. In 2004, an inter-club league was established by the four SCC member clubs: Bashers CC, DPR Hot Dogs, Maharajas (now Daredevils) and Pudong CC. The club hosted the Shanghai International Sixes from 1997 through 2009. During this time, a women's side (currently defunct) also existed called the Pearls. The club has two representative teams, the Dragons and the Pirates. Drawn from the best cricket players in the city, the Dragons regularly tour throughout Asia and host international teams in Shanghai. The Dragons have also participated in most of the major tournaments on the Asian Cricket Sixes Tour, winning in Hong Kong, Manila and Phuket. The Pirates were created in 2005 for the Hong Kong Cricket Sixes Festival, and are composed of representatives of all seven member clubs and associate teams in Shanghai. They regularly join the Dragons on tours throughout Asia, focusing heavily on social activities and touring. The Shanghai Cricket Club plays regular matches with the Hong Kong Cricket Club, Kowloon Cricket Club, Lamma Cricket Club, and the Beijing Cricket Club. In addition, the club plays semi-regular fixtures against Centaurs Cricket Club, Singapore Cricket Club, and Kai Tak Cricket Club and has hosted many international touring sides including Marylebone Cricket Club. The Shanghai Cricket Club was also the first club to play organized cricket in North Korea, competing for the Pyongyang Friendship Trophy in 2008. The SCC currently plays at grounds in Waigaoqiao, Pudong, and at Wellington College International. SCC League =League Structure= The Shanghai Cricket Club runs a three division league. The league is made up of the four foundation clubs (Bashers CC, Daredevils CC, DPR Hot Dogs, Pudong CC) as well as four associate teams: K2 CCC, China Zalmi CC, Dulwich Knights and Charminar Cheetahs CC. League matches are played on Sundays from April through September and feature limited overs cricket.

It was created in the Goryeo dynasty era. It also practiced in ritual dance of Seungjeonmu. Its name comprises the two words, mu (무, 舞) and go (고, 鼓) literally meaning dance and drum in Korean respectively. Origins Buk for mugo described in Akhak Gwebeom According to \\"Akji\\" (악지, 樂志), two books from \\"Goryeosa\\" (고려사 高麗史) which describe the music of Goryeo dynasty, mugo originated from a government officer, Lee Hon (hangul:이혼, Hanja:李混) during the reign of King Chungnyeol (reign. 1274 – 1308). While being exiled to Yonghae (영해, 寧海), a coastal region in North Gyeongsang Province, Lee Hon one day made a large drum of a log raft and played it while dancing. Later this dance was transmitted to the Joseon dynasty and was performed at various events of the Korean palaces and local government offices. There has always been changes in the performance of \\"Mugo\\" per each time period since the Goryeo dynasty. The performance was played by Gisaeng who was hitting the drum and singing the song of Jeongeupsa (정읍사 井邑詞). As the number of drums changes, the number of Gisaeng also changes. Depending on the number of drums, the name also changed to two-drum dance, four-drum dance and eight-drum dance. Forms Eight dancers perform with one large drum placed on the center of the stage. The main dancers called wonmu (원무), and the assisting dancers called hyeopmu (협무). Four dancers hold a drumstick in each hand, surround and play the drum; the others, holding a flower-shaped stick in each hand, form an outer circle. The dancers wear a jacket of which the color represents a certain direction: black-north, red-south, blue-east, and white-west.

The song proved to be one of the band's most popular, featuring a clearly defined pop sound quite different from Cold Chisel's more usual hard-edged rock.

All members of the genus are found in the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South America, and various subantarctic islands. Common name and etymology The common name for Durvillaea is southern bull kelp, although this is often shortened to bull kelp, which can generate confusion with the North Pacific kelp species Nereocystis luetkeana. The genus is named after French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville (1790-1842). Description D. antarctica showing the 'honeycomb' structure of the blades Durvillaea species are characterised by their prolific growth and plastic morphology. Two species, D. antarctica and D. poha are buoyant due to a honeycomb-like structure in the fronds of the kelp that holds air. When these species detach from the seabed, this buoyancy allows for plants to drift for substantial distances, permitting long distance dispersal. In contrast, species as D. willana lack such 'honeycomb' tissue and are non-buoyant, preventing the plants from moving long distances. Ecology Durvillaea bull kelp grow within intertidal and shallow subtidal areas, typically on rocky wave-exposed coastal sites. D. antarctica and D. poha are intertidal, whereas D. willana is subtidal (to 6 m depths). Intertidal species can grow at the uppermost limit of the intertidal zone if there is sufficient wave wash. Species can withstand a high level of disturbance from wave action, although storms can remove plants from substrates. =Epifauna, parasites and rafting= Beachcast D. antarctica kelp frond with blisters caused by an infection Holdfasts of D. antarctica and other species are often inhabited by a diverse array of epifaunal invertebrates, many of which burrow into and graze on the kelp. In New Zealand, epifaunal species include the sea-star Anasterias suteri, crustaceans Parawaldeckia kidderi, P. karaka, Limnoria segnis and L. stephenseni, and the molluscs Cantharidus roseus, Onchidella marginata, Onithochiton neglectus, and Sypharochiton sinclairi. Beachcast D. antarctica at St Kilda Beach, Dunedin Specimens of Durvillaea can detach from substrates, particularly during storms. Once detached, buoyant species such as D. antarctica and D. poha can float as rafts, and can travel vast distances at sea, driven by ocean currents. Kelp-associated invertebrates can be transported inside of drifting kelp holdfasts, potentially leading to long- distance dispersal and a significant impact upon the population genetic structure of the invertebrate species. Fronds of D. antarctica can be infected by an endophytic, phaeophycean algal parasite Herpodiscus durvillaeae (Lindauer) G.R. South. Based on genetic evidence, H. durvillaeae also seems to have also been be transmitted via rafting. In New Zealand, Durvillaea fronds can also be infected by the obligate red algal epiphyte Pyrophyllon subtumens (J. Agardh ex R.M. Laing) W.A. Nelson 2003. =Environmental stressors= Increased temperatures and heatwaves, increased sedimentation, and invasive species (such as Undaria pinnatifida) are sources of physiological stress and disturbance for members of the genus. A marine heatwave in the summer of 2017/18 appears to have caused the local extinction of multiple Durvillaea species at Pile Bay, on the Banks Peninsula. Once the kelp was extirpated, the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida recruited in high densities. Disturbance from earthquake uplift A die off of exposed Durvillaea kelp following uplift caused by the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake Earthquake uplift that raises the intertidal zone by as little as 1.5 metres can cause Durvillaea bull kelp to die off in large numbers. Increased sedimentation following landslides caused by earthquakes is also detrimental. Once an area is cleared of Durvillaea following an uplift event, the bull kelp that re-colonises the area can potentially originate from genetically distinct populations far outside the uplift zone, spread via long distance-dispersal. Intertidal species of Durvillaea can be used to estimate earthquake uplift height, with comparable results to traditional methods such as lidar. However, since Durvillaea holdfasts often grow at the uppermost limit of the intertidal zone, these uplift estimates are slightly less accurate compared to measures derived from other intertidal kelp such as Carpophyllum maschalocarpum. =Chile= The 2010 Chile earthquake caused significant coastal uplift (~0.2 to 3.1 m), particularly around the Gulf of Arauco, Santa María Island and the Bay of Concepción. This uplift caused large scale die offs of D. antarctica and dramatically affected the intertidal community. The damage to infrastructure and ecological disturbance caused by the earthquake was assessed to be particularly damaging for seaweed gatherers and cochayuyo harvest. =New Zealand= Durvillaea kelp and other seaweeds exposed by earthquake uplift at Kaikōura Akatore Duvillaea bull kelp diversity appears to have been affected by uplift along the Akatore fault zone. Phylogeographic analyses using mitochondrial COX1 sequence data and genotyping by sequencing data for thousands of anonymous nuclear loci, indicate that a historic uplift event (800 – 1400 years before present) along the fault zone and subsequent recolonisation, has left a lasting impact upon the genetic diversity of the intertidal species D. antarctica and D. poha, but not on the subtidal species D. willana. Such a genetic impact may support the founder takes all hypothesis. Kaikōura A substantial die off of Durvillaea bull kelp occurred along the Kaikōura coastline following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, which caused uplift up to 6 metres. The loss of Durvillaea kelp caused ecological disturbance, significantly affecting the biodiversity of the local intertidal community. Genetic analysis indicated that some of the Durvillaea that subsequently reached the affected coastline came from areas >1,200 kilometres away. Wellington and the Wairarapa It has been hypothesised that gaps in the current geographic range of D. willana around Wellington and the Wairarapa may have been caused by local extinction following historic earthquake uplift events such as the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake. However, uplift along the Akatore fault zone does not appear to have significantly affected the genetic diversity of D. willana in that region, which suggests that earthquake uplift may be insufficient to cause the complete extirpation of this subtidal species. Species and distribution There are currently eight recognised species within the genus, and the type species is D. antarctica.Bory de Saint-Vincent, J.B.G.M. (1826). Laminaire, Laminaria.

Notably, additional unclassified lineages were estimated within D. antarctica. Use of Durvillaea species =Australia= D. potatorum was used extensively for clothing and tools by Aboriginal Tasmanians, with uses including material for shoes and bags to transport freshwater and food. Currently, D. potatorum is collected as beach wrack from King Island, where it is then dried as chips and sent to Scotland for phycocolloid extraction. =Chile= D. antarctica and D. incurvata have been used in Chilean cuisine for salads and stews, predominantly by the Mapuche indigenous people who refer to it as ' or '. The same species is also called ''''' (': lake, and ': weed), and hulte in Quechua. The kelp harvest, complemented with shellfish gathering, supports artisanal fishing communities in Chile. Exclusive harvest rights are designated using coves or caletas, and the income for fishers (and their unions) often depends upon the sale of cochayuyo. =New Zealand= Māori use D. antarctica (''''') and D. poha to make traditional pōhā bags, which are used to transport food and fresh water, to propagate live shellfish, and to make clothing and equipment for sports. Pōhā are especially associated with Ngāi Tahu and are often used to carry and store muttonbird (tītī) chicks. The Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998 protects Durvillaea bull kelp from commercial harvesting within the tribe's traditional seaweed-gathering areas.

Grounded in his journalistic background, his writing style is polished and unsentimental, and Kim crafts his sentences masterfully to infuse lyrical rhythm to his work without sacrificing clarity and poise. His job as a journalist, which required him to rush to the scenes of disaster, has also given him an insight into the psychology of people in extreme circumstances. Kim’s ability to discern pertinent details and moments of significance in the chaos of life-or-death situations, which he perfected in his line of work as a reporter, can be observed in his first novel, Memories of Earthenware with Comb Teeth Pattern. Written in form of a detective story involving a mysterious death of a firefighter, the novel presents a palpably real portrait of the battle with raging fire, and investigates the intensity of human emotions in dire circumstances with acuity, subtlety and insight. In his second novel Song of Sword, Kim gives us a powerful picture of General Yi Sun- sin, not as a mere war-hero, but as an ordinary man facing extraordinary circumstances and struggling with complexity of his own interior landscape.

It is the act of creating an output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.\\"Kotler\\", P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) Marketing, 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall. The area of economics that focuses on production is referred to as production theory, which in many respects is similar to the consumption (or consumer) theory in economics. Sickles, R., & Zelenyuk, V. (2019). Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139565981 Economic well-being is created in a production process, meaning all economic activities that aim directly or indirectly to satisfy human wants and needs. The degree to which the needs are satisfied is often accepted as a measure of economic well-being. In production there are two features which explain increasing economic well-being. They are improving quality-price-ratio of goods and services and increasing incomes from growing and more efficient market production or total production which help in increasing GDP. The most important forms of production are: * market production * public production * household production In order to understand the origin of economic well-being, we must understand these three production processes. All of them produce commodities which have value and contribute to well-being of individuals. The satisfaction of needs originates from the use of the commodities which are produced. The need satisfaction increases when the quality-price-ratio of the commodities improves and more satisfaction is achieved at less cost. Improving the quality-price-ratio of commodities is to a producer an essential way to improve the competitiveness of products but this kind of gains distributed to customers cannot be measured with production data. Improving the competitiveness of products means often to the producer lower product prices and therefore losses in incomes which are to be compensated with the growth of sales volume. Economic well-being also increases due to the growth of incomes that are gained from the growing and more efficient market production. Market production is the only production form which creates and distributes incomes to stakeholders. Public production and household production are financed by the incomes generated in market production. Thus market production has a double role in creating well-being, i.e. the role of producing goods and services and the role of creating income. Because of this double role market production is the “primus motor” of economic well-being and therefore here under review. As a source of economic well-being In principle there are two main activities in an economy, production and consumption. Similarly, there are two kinds of actors, producers and consumers. Well-being is made possible by efficient production and by the interaction between producers and consumers. In the interaction, consumers can be identified in two roles both of which generate well-being. Consumers can be both customers of the producers and suppliers to the producers. The customers' well-being arises from the commodities they are buying and the suppliers' well-being is related to the income they receive as compensation for the production inputs they have delivered to the producers. =Stakeholders of production= Stakeholders of production are persons, groups or organizations with an interest in a producing company. Economic well-being originates in efficient production and it is distributed through the interaction between the company's stakeholders. The stakeholders of companies are economic actors which have an economic interest in a company. Based on the similarities of their interests, stakeholders can be classified into three groups in order to differentiate their interests and mutual relations. The three groups are as follows: Interactive contributions of a company’s stakeholders (Saari, 2011,4) *Customers *Suppliers *Producers. The interests of these stakeholders and their relations to companies are described briefly below. Our purpose is to establish a framework for further analysis. Customers The customers of a company are typically consumers, other market producers or producers in the public sector. Each of them has their individual production functions. Due to competition, the price-quality-ratios of commodities tend to improve and this brings the benefits of better productivity to customers. Customers get more for less. In households and the public sector this means that more need satisfaction is achieved at less cost. For this reason the productivity of customers can increase over time even though their incomes remain unchanged. Suppliers The suppliers of companies are typically producers of materials, energy, capital, and services. They all have their individual production functions. The changes in prices or qualities of supplied commodities have an effect on both actors' (company and suppliers) production functions. We come to the conclusion that the production functions of the company and its suppliers are in a state of continuous change. Producer community The incomes are generated for those participating in production, i.e., the labour force, society and owners. These stakeholders are referred to here as producer communities or, in shorter form, as producers. The producer communities have a common interest in maximizing their incomes. These parties that contribute to production receive increased incomes from the growing and developing production. The well-being gained through commodities stems from the price- quality relations of the commodities. Due to competition and development in the market, the price-quality relations of commodities tend to improve over time. Typically the quality of a commodity goes up and the price goes down over time. This development favourably affects the production functions of customers. Customers get more for less. Consumer customers get more satisfaction at less cost. This type of well-being generation can only partially be calculated from the production data. The situation is presented in this study. The producer community (labour force, society, and owners) earns income as compensation for the inputs they have delivered to the production. When the production grows and becomes more efficient, the income tends to increase. In production this brings about an increased ability to pay salaries, taxes and profits. The growth of production and improved productivity generate additional income for the producing community. Similarly the high income level achieved in the community is a result of the high volume of production and its good performance. This type of well-being generation – as mentioned earlier - can be reliably calculated from the production data. =Main processes of a producing company= A producing company can be divided into sub-processes in different ways; yet, the following five are identified as main processes, each with a logic, objectives, theory and key figures of its own. It is important to examine each of them individually, yet, as a part of the whole, in order to be able to measure and understand them. The main processes of a company are as follows: Main processes of a producing company (Saari 2006,3) * real process. * income distribution process * production process. * monetary process. * market value process. Production output is created in the real process, gains of production are distributed in the income distribution process and these two processes constitute the production process. The production process and its sub-processes, the real process and income distribution process occur simultaneously, and only the production process is identifiable and measurable by the traditional accounting practices. The real process and income distribution process can be identified and measured by extra calculation, and this is why they need to be analyzed separately in order to understand the logic of production and its performance. Real process generates the production output from input, and it can be described by means of the production function. It refers to a series of events in production in which production inputs of different quality and quantity are combined into products of different quality and quantity. Products can be physical goods, immaterial services and most often combinations of both. The characteristics created into the product by the producer imply surplus value to the consumer, and on the basis of the market price this value is shared by the consumer and the producer in the marketplace. This is the mechanism through which surplus value originates to the consumer and the producer likewise. Surplus values to customers cannot be measured from any production data. Instead the surplus value to a producer can be measured. It can be expressed both in terms of nominal and real values. The real surplus value to the producer is an outcome of the real process, real income, and measured proportionally it means productivity. The concept “real process” in the meaning quantitative structure of production process was introduced in Finnish management accounting in 1960s. Since then it has been a cornerstone in the Finnish management accounting theory. (Riistama et al. 1971) Income distribution process of the production refers to a series of events in which the unit prices of constant-quality products and inputs alter causing a change in income distribution among those participating in the exchange. The magnitude of the change in income distribution is directly proportionate to the change in prices of the output and inputs and to their quantities. Productivity gains are distributed, for example, to customers as lower product sales prices or to staff as higher income pay. The production process consists of the real process and the income distribution process. A result and a criterion of success of the owner is profitability. The profitability of production is the share of the real process result the owner has been able to keep to himself in the income distribution process. Factors describing the production process are the components of profitability, i.e., returns and costs. They differ from the factors of the real process in that the components of profitability are given at nominal prices whereas in the real process the factors are at periodically fixed prices. Monetary process refers to events related to financing the business. Market value process refers to a series of events in which investors determine the market value of the company in the investment markets. =Production growth and performance= Economic growth is often defined as a production increase of an output of a production process. It is usually expressed as a growth percentage depicting growth of the real production output. The real output is the real value of products produced in a production process and when we subtract the real input from the real output we get the real income. The real output and the real income are generated by the real process of production from the real inputs. The real process can be described by means of the production function. The production function is a graphical or mathematical expression showing the relationship between the inputs used in production and the output achieved. Both graphical and mathematical expressions are presented and demonstrated. The production function is a simple description of the mechanism of income generation in production process. It consists of two components. These components are a change in production input and a change in productivity.Genesca & Grifell 1992, Saari 2006 Components of economic growth (Saari 2006,2) The figure illustrates an income generation process (exaggerated for clarity). The Value T2 (value at time 2) represents the growth in output from Value T1 (value at time 1). Each time of measurement has its own graph of the production function for that time (the straight lines). The output measured at time 2 is greater than the output measured at time one for both of the components of growth: an increase of inputs and an increase of productivity. The portion of growth caused by the increase in inputs is shown on line 1 and does not change the relation between inputs and outputs. The portion of growth caused by an increase in productivity is shown on line 2 with a steeper slope. So increased productivity represents greater output per unit of input. The growth of production output does not reveal anything about the performance of the production process. The performance of production measures production's ability to generate income. Because the income from production is generated in the real process, we call it the real income. Similarly, as the production function is an expression of the real process, we could also call it “income generated by the production function”. The real income generation follows the logic of the production function. Two components can also be distinguished in the income change: the income growth caused by an increase in production input (production volume) and the income growth caused by an increase in productivity. The income growth caused by increased production volume is determined by moving along the production function graph. The income growth corresponding to a shift of the production function is generated by the increase in productivity. The change of real income so signifies a move from the point 1 to the point 2 on the production function (above). When we want to maximize the production performance we have to maximize the income generated by the production function. The sources of productivity growth and production volume growth are explained as follows. Productivity growth is seen as the key economic indicator of innovation. The successful introduction of new products and new or altered processes, organization structures, systems, and business models generates growth of output that exceeds the growth of inputs. This results in growth in productivity or output per unit of input. Income growth can also take place without innovation through replication of established technologies. With only replication and without innovation, output will increase in proportion to inputs. (Jorgenson et al. 2014,2) This is the case of income growth through production volume growth. Jorgenson et al. (2014,2) give an empiric example. They show that the great preponderance of economic growth in the US since 1947 involves the replication of existing technologies through investment in equipment, structures, and software and expansion of the labor force. Further they show that innovation accounts for only about twenty percent of US economic growth. In the case of a single production process (described above) the output is defined as an economic value of products and services produced in the process. When we want to examine an entity of many production processes we have to sum up the value-added created in the single processes. This is done in order to avoid the double accounting of intermediate inputs. Value-added is obtained by subtracting the intermediate inputs from the outputs. The most well-known and used measure of value-added is the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). It is widely used as a measure of the economic growth of nations and industries. =Absolute (total) and average income= The production performance can be measured as an average or an absolute income. Expressing performance both in average (avg.) and absolute (abs.) quantities is helpful for understanding the welfare effects of production. For measurement of the average production performance, we use the known productivity ratio * Real output / Real input. The absolute income of performance is obtained by subtracting the real input from the real output as follows: * Real income (abs.) = Real output – Real input The growth of the real income is the increase of the economic value which can be distributed between the production stakeholders. With the aid of the production model we can perform the average and absolute accounting in one calculation. Maximizing production performance requires using the absolute measure, i.e. the real income and its derivatives as a criterion of production performance. Maximizing productivity also leads to the phenomenon called \\"jobless growth\\" This refers to economic growth as a result of productivity growth but without creation of new jobs and new incomes from them. A practical example illustrates the case. When a jobless person obtains a job in market production we may assume it is a low productivity job. As a result, average productivity decreases but the real income per capita increases. Furthermore, the well- being of the society also grows. This example reveals the difficulty to interpret the total productivity change correctly. The combination of volume increase and total productivity decrease leads in this case to the improved performance because we are on the “diminishing returns” area of the production function. If we are on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, the combination of production volume increase and total productivity increase leads to improved production performance. Unfortunately, we do not know in practice on which part of the production function we are. Therefore, a correct interpretation of a performance change is obtained only by measuring the real income change. Production models A production model is a numerical description of the production process and is based on the prices and the quantities of inputs and outputs. There are two main approaches to operationalize the concept of production function. We can use mathematical formulae, which are typically used in macroeconomics (in growth accounting) or arithmetical models, which are typically used in microeconomics and management accounting. We do not present the former approach here but refer to the survey “Growth accounting” by Hulten 2009. Also see an extensive discussion of various production models and their estimations in Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019, Chapter 1-2). We use here arithmetical models because they are like the models of management accounting, illustrative and easily understood and applied in practice. Furthermore, they are integrated to management accounting, which is a practical advantage. A major advantage of the arithmetical model is its capability to depict production function as a part of production process. Consequently, production function can be understood, measured, and examined as a part of production process. There are different production models according to different interests. Here we use a production income model and a production analysis model in order to demonstrate production function as a phenomenon and a measureable quantity. =Production income model= Profitability of production measured by surplus value (Saari 2006,3) The scale of success run by a going concern is manifold, and there are no criteria that might be universally applicable to success. Nevertheless, there is one criterion by which we can generalise the rate of success in production. This criterion is the ability to produce surplus value. As a criterion of profitability, surplus value refers to the difference between returns and costs, taking into consideration the costs of equity in addition to the costs included in the profit and loss statement as usual. Surplus value indicates that the output has more value than the sacrifice made for it, in other words, the output value is higher than the value (production costs) of the used inputs. If the surplus value is positive, the owner’s profit expectation has been surpassed. The table presents a surplus value calculation. We call this set of production data a basic example and we use the data through the article in illustrative production models. The basic example is a simplified profitability calculation used for illustration and modelling. Even as reduced, it comprises all phenomena of a real measuring situation and most importantly the change in the output-input mix between two periods. Hence, the basic example works as an illustrative “scale model” of production without any features of a real measuring situation being lost. In practice, there may be hundreds of products and inputs but the logic of measuring does not differ from that presented in the basic example. In this context we define the quality requirements for the production data used in productivity accounting. The most important criterion of good measurement is the homogenous quality of the measurement object. If the object is not homogenous, then the measurement result may include changes in both quantity and quality but their respective shares will remain unclear. In productivity accounting this criterion requires that every item of output and input must appear in accounting as being homogenous. In other words, the inputs and the outputs are not allowed to be aggregated in measuring and accounting. If they are aggregated, they are no longer homogenous and hence the measurement results may be biased. Both the absolute and relative surplus value have been calculated in the example. Absolute value is the difference of the output and input values and the relative value is their relation, respectively. The surplus value calculation in the example is at a nominal price, calculated at the market price of each period. =Production analysis model= Production Model Saari 2004 (Saari 2006,4) A model Courbois & Temple 1975, Gollop 1979, Kurosawa 1975, Saari 1976, 2006 used here is a typical production analysis model by help of which it is possible to calculate the outcome of the real process, income distribution process and production process. The starting point is a profitability calculation using surplus value as a criterion of profitability. The surplus value calculation is the only valid measure for understanding the connection between profitability and productivity or understanding the connection between real process and production process. A valid measurement of total productivity necessitates considering all production inputs, and the surplus value calculation is the only calculation to conform to the requirement. If we omit an input in productivity or income accounting, this means that the omitted input can be used unlimitedly in production without any cost impact on accounting results. =Accounting and interpreting = The process of calculating is best understood by applying the term ceteris paribus, i.e. \\"all other things being the same,\\" stating that at a time only the impact of one changing factor be introduced to the phenomenon being examined. Therefore, the calculation can be presented as a process advancing step by step. First, the impacts of the income distribution process are calculated, and then, the impacts of the real process on the profitability of the production. The first step of the calculation is to separate the impacts of the real process and the income distribution process, respectively, from the change in profitability (285.12 – 266.00 = 19.12). This takes place by simply creating one auxiliary column (4) in which a surplus value calculation is compiled using the quantities of Period 1 and the prices of Period 2. In the resulting profitability calculation, Columns 3 and 4 depict the impact of a change in income distribution process on the profitability and in Columns 4 and 7 the impact of a change in real process on the profitability. The accounting results are easily interpreted and understood. We see that the real income has increased by 58.12 units from which 41.12 units come from the increase of productivity growth and the rest 17.00 units come from the production volume growth. The total increase of real income (58.12) is distributed to the stakeholders of production, in this case 39.00 units to the customers and to the suppliers of inputs and the rest 19.12 units to the owners. Here we can make an important conclusion. Income formation of production is always a balance between income generation and income distribution. The income change created in a real process (i.e. by production function) is always distributed to the stakeholders as economic values within the review period. Accordingly, the changes in real income and income distribution are always equal in terms of economic value. Based on the accounted changes of productivity and production volume values we can explicitly conclude on which part of the production function the production is. The rules of interpretations are the following: The production is on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, when * productivity and production volume increase or * productivity and production volume decrease The production is on the part of “diminishing returns” on the production function, when * productivity decreases and volume increases or * productivity increases and volume decreases. In the basic example the combination of volume growth (+17.00) and productivity growth (+41.12) reports explicitly that the production is on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function (Saari 2006 a, 138–144). Another production model (Production Model Saari 1989) also gives details of the income distribution (Saari 2011,14). Because the accounting techniques of the two models are different, they give differing, although complementary, analytical information. The accounting results are, however, identical. We do not present the model here in detail but we only use its detailed data on income distribution, when the objective functions are formulated in the next section. Objective functions An efficient way to improve the understanding of production performance is to formulate different objective functions according to the objectives of the different interest groups. Formulating the objective function necessitates defining the variable to be maximized (or minimized). After that other variables are considered as constraints or free variables. The most familiar objective function is profit maximization which is also included in this case. Profit maximization is an objective function that stems from the owner's interest and all other variables are constraints in relation to maximizing of profits in the organization. Summary of objective function formulations (Saari 2011,17) =The procedure for formulating objective functions= The procedure for formulating different objective functions, in terms of the production model, is introduced next. In the income formation from production the following objective functions can be identified: * Maximizing the real income * Maximizing the producer income * Maximizing the owner income. These cases are illustrated using the numbers from the basic example. The following symbols are used in the presentation: The equal sign (=) signifies the starting point of the computation or the result of computing and the plus or minus sign (+ / -) signifies a variable that is to be added or subtracted from the function. A producer means here the producer community, i.e. labour force, society and owners. Objective function formulations can be expressed in a single calculation which concisely illustrates the logic of the income generation, the income distribution and the variables to be maximized. The calculation resembles an income statement starting with the income generation and ending with the income distribution. The income generation and the distribution are always in balance so that their amounts are equal. In this case it is 58.12 units. The income which has been generated in the real process is distributed to the stakeholders during the same period. There are three variables which can be maximized. They are the real income, the producer income and the owner income. Producer income and owner income are practical quantities because they are addable quantities and they can be computed quite easily. Real income is normally not an addable quantity and in many cases it is difficult to calculate. =The dual approach for the formulation= Here we have to add that the change of real income can also be computed from the changes in income distribution. We have to identify the unit price changes of outputs and inputs and calculate their profit impacts (i.e. unit price change x quantity). The change of real income is the sum of these profit impacts and the change of owner income. This approach is called the dual approach because the framework is seen in terms of prices instead of quantities (ONS 3, 23). The dual approach has been recognized in growth accounting for long but its interpretation has remained unclear. The following question has remained unanswered: “Quantity based estimates of the residual are interpreted as a shift in the production function, but what is the interpretation of the price- based growth estimates?” (Hulten 2009, 18). We have demonstrated above that the real income change is achieved by quantitative changes in production and the income distribution change to the stakeholders is its dual. In this case the duality means that the same accounting result is obtained by accounting the change of the total income generation (real income) and by accounting the change of the total income distribution.

Life  He received his Ph.D in organic chemistry from Basel University, Switzerland in 1940. Being Jewish, Basel provided a safe haven for him during the Second World War and he stayed there until 1947 as Assistant to Professor Hans Friedrich Albrecht Erlenmeyer (1900 - 1967), the son of Friedrich Gustav Carl Emil Erlenmeyer (Emil Jr.) and grandson of Richard August Carl Emil Erlenmeyer (Emil Sr.). During his time there he compiled the data for the first two volumes of \\"Synthetische Methoden der Organische Chemie\\" published by S. Karger Verlag in Basel in 1946 and 1948. These built on the system of Conrad Weygand (Organic Preparations, Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York, 1945) for grouping similar reactions together, but used \\"Theilheimer reaction symbols\\" that summarised the most significant bond formed, the reaction type (addition reaction, rearrangement reaction, exchange reaction/substitution reaction or elimination reaction), and the bond broken or fragment lost, as well as a specific reagent order based on the periodic table. Later volumes were sponsored by a number of American chemical and pharmaceutical firms, most notably Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., who provided library facilities at their site in Nutley, New Jersey from 1948 up to (and after) Theilheimer's retirement in 1981. His books were developed as modern chemical reaction databases in the 1980s by MDL (Molecular Design Limited) and ORAC (Organic Reactions Accessed by Computer); both of these companies were taken over by Robert Maxwell's Maxwell Communications Corporation.

He was regarded as one of the greatest figures in Yiddish theatre. Early life He was born Yoshe Maurer Neumann in the town of Boryslav, then a thriving Oil town in Galicia, Austria and today part of the Ukraine. Maurer was the son of the local cobbler, and known as an amateur violinist, actor and singer. Career When the famous Vilnius Jewish Theatre (Vilna Troupe), under the direction of Zygmund Turkow visited Boryslav in 1922, the 16-year-old Yoshe was offered a minor role. Two weeks later, as the Theatre left, so did Yoshe, never to return to his home town. As a member of this famous Yiddish Theatre he toured Poland and Rumania until 1927, when he emigrated to Argentina. In Buenos Aires he became one of the leading actors in the Jewish Yiddish Theatre, playing along such renowned actors as Joseph Buloff, Maurice Schwartz and Jacob Ben-Ami. He was regarded as a first class \\"character\\" (drama) actor and as a \\"tour de force\\" used to change leading roles, for example, playing with Ben Ami both parts of Man and Devil in Got, Mentsch Und Taivel, the famous Yiddish version of Faust by Jacob Gordin, night after night. On the other hand, he had a gift for comedy and took part in many musical comedies. In the late nineteen-forties, he was elected President of the Jewish Actors Guild in Argentina and served in this post for more than 20 years, until his emigration to Israel. He was a notable co-star in 28 Argentine films, specializing in \\"foreign\\" accents and played the Spanish Argentine stage, among others, with Berta Singerman. In 1963, he moved to Israel where he played the Yiddish stage and was elected there too as President of the Yiddish Actor's Guild until his death. Death and legacy His lifelong wish was to die on stage and this he did. In 1968, shortly after the curtain went down, and still wearing makeup on his face, he had a stroke and died shortly afterwards, aged 62. His collection of manuscript plays, including translations into Yiddish of modern Argentine drama, was donated to the Bar Ilan University and is now part of the Rena Costa Center for Yiddish Studies.

History 2Clix was founded in 1997 in Australia, but they also had an office in the United Kingdom. The company's flagship product, 2Clix was a business management and accounting suite. 2Clix was awarded a Gold Coast Business award in July 2004. On 22 October 2007 it was reported that 2Clix has appointed Worrell's solvency and forensic accountants as an administrator. Registered creditors can access details from Worrell's site. Former employees have been made redundant and are registered as creditors to claim their owed entitlements. Prior to their insolvency and liquidation proceedings, 2Clix management created a new company called Platinum One, intending to relaunch the same 2Clix software, rebranding it Platinum One. After the worldwide controversy in relation to the Whirlpool forum, which saw the name Platinum One heavily associated with 2Clix, the same management team created a new company called Total ERP Solutions, again releasing exactly the same software package in an attempt to rebuild. Following the collapse of the re-branded product due to the bad publicity, the remaining customer base of 2Clix and the re-branded product Platinum One was sold to Madeurne Pty LtdMadeurne Company Information in March 2010. The directors of Madeurne Pty Ltd (Director Maureen Poppins, de facto partner of Dean Mills the previous Director of 2Clix) spent the next 14 months rebuilding the software from the ground up and while they maintained some of the look of 2Clix, claiming that the existing customer base and new customers found this the preferred interface, the back end structure and front end source code was completely replaced. Whirlpool controversy On 11 September 2007, Whirlpool announced that its founder, Simon Wright, was being sued by 2Clix for alleged 'Injurious Falsehood',http://whirlpool.net.au/img/article/2clix/soc.pdf a tort not dissimilar to defamation under Australian law, resulting in \\"a severe downturn in monthly sales\\".Neowin.net – 2Clix sues Australian Site Whirlpool Over Forum Topic Specifically, 2Clix claimed that comments on the Whirlpool Forums regarding alleged major issues with the product were 'False and Malicious'. 2Clix \\"quantifies its loss in income between January 2007 to July 2007 at approximately A$150,000 per month\\" and was suing for A$150,000 plus interest, plus legal costs. The complaint asked the court for A$150,000 total in the summary of relief, while claiming damages of A$150,000 per month. While legal experts doubted the ability of 2Clix to win the case from the outset, it could have had major ramifications for website operators and their users. A win for 2Clix could have set a precedent and seriously limited the ability of web users to criticise companies' products and services.Lawsuit over forum comments withdrawn – web – Technology – smh.com.au Whirlpool users subsequently began donating money to assist the site in its coming legal battle. Some users claim to have had personally donated more than A$1000 through PayPalFirm sues forum to silence critics – web – Technology – smh.com.au and the Managing Director of PIPE Networks personally pledged A$10,000 to support Whirlpool's cause.

National Geographic also published an article by Frank Viviano; in July 2005, he visited Pate Island. During the time he stayed on Lamu, ceramic fragments had been found around Lamu which the administrative officer of the local Swahili history museum claimed were of Chinese origin, specifically from Zheng He's voyage to east Africa. The eyes of the Pate people resembled Chinese and Famao and Wei were some of the names among them which were speculated to be of Chinese origin. Their ancestors were said to be from indigenous women who intermarried with Chinese Ming sailors when they were shipwrecked. Two places on Pate were called \\"Old Shanga\\", and \\"New Shanga\\", which the Chinese sailors had named. A local guide who claimed descent from the Chinese showed Frank a graveyard made out of coral on the island, indicating that they were the graves of the Chinese sailors, which the author described as \\"virtually identical\\", to Chinese Ming dynasty tombs, complete with \\"half-moon domes\\" and \\"terraced entries\\". Indians in Africa The Indian community in Africa is found throughout the continent with large communities existing in South Africa, Mauritius, Réunion, and other parts of the continent. The arrival of Indians on the continent often coincides with the expanding European presence on the continent. There continues to be a notable Indian presence with numbers currently estimating roughly 2,750,000 Indians on the continent. There have historically been and continue to be tensions between Indians and black communities throughout the continent. The most notable example being the expulsion of Indians by Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Other Indians came more recently to Africa as traders and professional workers especially in Mozambique with its huge group of Indians. The 70,000 Indians in Mozambique have had a long history with their origins in Mozambique. The African nations with the largest Indian communities are South Africa with 1,560,000, Mauritius with 894,000, Nigeria with 800,000, Réunion with 280,250, http://mea.gov.in/images/attach/NRIs-and-PIOs_1.pdf Kenya with 110,000, Mozambique with 70,000, Tanzania with 60,000, Uganda with 50,000, Madagascar with 25,000, Zambia with 13,000http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/zambia-population/ and Ghana, Malawi, the Seychelles and Zimbabwe with 10,000. 8,000 Indians live in Botswana, 8,000 in São Tomé and Príncipe, 3,000 in Rwanda,http://www.hope- mag.com/index.php?com=news&option;=read&ca;=1&a;=3758 2,700 in South Sudan, https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/South_Sudan_Jan_2016_english.pdf Burundi with 2,000 https://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/bethnic.htm and Eritrea with 1,200.http://www.eoikhartoum.gov.in/India-Eritrea-Bilateral-Brief.php 20,000 foreigners of which 4,372 are Indians work in the DR Congo for MONUSCO. People from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Uruguay are the main workers for MONUSCO in the DR Congo. =Indians in South Africa= The first Indians in South Africa arrived on the Cape of Good Hope as slaves brought by the Dutch East Indies Company in 1654. The slaves were bought from Muslim ruled regions on the Indian subcontinent. However the most significant migrations of Indians came when the Natal become a British colony and large numbers were brought as Indian indenture system. Often serving as labourers on sugar plantations, but also in coal mines. More than 150,000 Indians were brought to the Natal over the course of 5 decades. The long term result was that by 1904 the Indian presence in the Natal outnumbered the white presence. The Indian community has faced legal discrimination, and such discrimination was considered a justification for the Second Boer War. =Indians in East Africa= Indians arrived in East Africa as workers to build the rail links in the region while it was under British rule. Originally arriving to build the rail line between Mombasa and Nairobi and laying the foundations for the colony of Kenya, many stayed in the region after the end of their labour contracts. Nearly 32,000 labourers were brought for the construction of this rail line. Following the end of these contracts many brought family from the Indian subcontinent to the region as the new link allowed for significant commercial opportunity. Relations between Asians and the black majority have not always been easy; most notably, Idi Amin, dictator of Uganda, expelled all Indians in 1972. However, after Amin fell from power, many Indians returned. Lebanese in Africa Over 500,000 people from Lebanon moved to Africa.https://www.voaafrique.com/a/cinq-cents-libanais-a-abidjan-pour- investir-en-afrique/4234683.html 0.1% of West Africans are of Lebanese descent. 300,000 Lebanese people live in the Ivory Coast, 150,000 live in Sierra Leone, 75,000 live in Nigeria, 40,000 live in Senegal and 9,000 live in DR Congo. Thousands of Lebanese also moved to The Gambia and Ghana. 3,500 people from Europe and Lebanon live in The Gambia, representing 0.23% of its total population.https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5459.htm 3,000 Lebanese and 2,000 Europeans live in Liberia, representing 0.1% of its population.https://www.bbc.com/news/world- africa-43113979https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/print_li.html Syrians in Africa 300,000 refugees from Syria moved to Egypt according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 250,000 refugees from Syria moved to Sudan in recent years. Austronesians The Merina people of Madagascar along with the Betsileo tribe are likely of Austronesian descent. Together, they represent about 35% of the population of the island of Madagascar. These two dominant ethnic groups are commonly accepted as indigenous to Madagascar, though they are likely descendants of Malay and Polynesian immigrations. For example, the Malagasy language is unrelated to nearby African languages, instead being the westernmost member of the Malayo- Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family.

Born in Payson, Utah, Schaerrer served as a missionary for the Church in Switzerland from 1950 to 1953. He was the president of the church's Austria Vienna Mission from 1972 to 1975. In 1975, Schaerrer established the LDS Church as a legal entity in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1977, Schaerrer was called as the general president of the Young Men. There had not been a general president since Robert L. Backman was released in 1974 and the organization was placed under the direct supervision of the church's presiding bishopric. Schaerrer served for two years and was succeeded by Backman, who by then had become a church general authority, in 1979. Schaerrer was the last non-general authority to serve as president of the Young Men until Charles W. Dahlquist II was called in 2004. Schaerrer's counselors were Graham W. Doxey and Quinn G. McKay. Schaerrer was married to Jane Coon and they were the parents of four children. He was an attorney by profession, and died in Salt Lake City at the age of 54. References *Arnold K. Garr, Donald Q.

It is the second video produced by As-Sahab purportedly featuring a eulogy by Osama bin Laden to the 9/11 hijacker Waleed al-Shehri. In the video, a voice identified as bin Laden's delivers the 14-minute introduction. The voice is heard over a still picture of bin Laden, dressed and groomed as he appears in the September 6, 2007 video. The 33-minute balance of the recording is a video that will read by al-Shehri. Some mainstream media outlets say that video lasts 47 minutes. The title of the video is 'The Wills of the Heroes of the Raids on New York and Washington.' According to CNN reporter Octavia Nasr: > \\"Although CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video, > it did feature the logo of As-Sahab Media, the company that traditionally > handles al Qaeda communications to the public. The 47-minute videotape was > obtained by terrorism expert Laura Mansfield before it was to appear on > several Islamist Web sites known for carrying statements from al Qaeda and > other radical groups.\\" The voice-over is spoken in Arabic and is heard over a still picture of bin Laden and contains English subtitles.

He is the seventh of the 19 hijackers to appear > in such a will since the terrorist attacks\\" and that \\"The voice and picture > in the video sound and appear similar to a bin Laden video released late > last week.\\" There is no indication that any part of the video was recorded recently. The only element tying it to somewhat-current events is in the introduction and the mention of the death of al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed during a U.S. raid in June 2006.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 11 *Independent 10 *Liberal Democrats 9 Background Before the election the Conservatives were the largest group with 13 seats, while there 9 Liberal Democrats and 8 independents. However the council was controlled by an alliance between independents and Liberal Democrats. 10 of the 30 seats on the council were elected in 2003, with the Conservatives defending 6, independents 3 and the Liberal Democrats defended 1 seat. Two of the three independents were re- elected without opposition. Election result Independents gained 2 seats from the Conservatives to mean there were 10 independent councillors on the council. The independent gains from the Conservatives came in Skipton East where Mike Hill was elected, and in West Craven where Robert Mason gained a seat. Meanwhile, another independent, Robert Heseltine, regained a seat on the council 3 years after having been forced to resign his seat due to being convicted of falsifying accounts, after defeating the sitting independent councillor Frances Cook by 217 votes in Skipton South. Despite losing 2 seats the Conservatives remained the largest group on the council with 11 councillors, after holding another 4 seats. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats stayed on 9 seats, after holding the only seat they had been defending in Skipton West.

Her designer was the French émigré shipwright Jean-Louis Barrallier. She served in two major battles, Algeciras Bay and San Domingo, and in a number of other campaigns. She was broken up in 1822. Wartime career Captain Henry D'Esterre Darby commissioned Spencer in June 1800. =Battle of Algeciras Bay= Naval combat between the French ship commanded by Captain Troude, and three British naval ships, Caesar, Spencer, Venerable and the frigate Thames in sight of Cadiz, 13 July 1801 By July 1801 Spencer was at the Rock of Gibraltar in the squadron under the command of Rear Admiral James Saumarez in James (1837), Vol. 3, p.113. On 6 July Saumarez sailed from Gibraltar with Caesar, Pompee, Spencer, , and with the intention of attacking Admiral Linois's squadron of three French line-of-battle ships and a frigate, which were lying a considerable distance from the batteries at Algeciras. As Venerable, the leading ship, approached the wind dropped and she was forced to anchor. Pompee managed to get into action but Hannibal grounded and was forced to strike. In the battle the British drove two of the French ships ashore and badly damaged the rest. The total loss in the British squadron was 121 killed, 240 wounded, and 14 missing. The Franco-Spanish force lost 317 men killed and some 3-500 wounded.James (1837), Vol. 3, p.118. On 8 July a squadron of five Spanish ships-of-the-line, a French 74, three frigates and a large number of gunboats reinforced the French ships. Hard work repaired all the British ships at Gibraltar, except Pompee in time for them to follow the Franco-Spanish fleet when it sailed on 12 July. In the subsequent second phase of the Battle of Algeciras Bay, the two first rates and fired upon each other during the night, caught fire and exploded, with tremendous loss of life. The British captured the third rate .James (1837), Vol. 3, p.128. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Gut of Gibraltar 12 July 1801\\" to all surviving claimants from the battle; 192 medals were issued. Spencer joined Admiral Robert Calder's squadron in October 1801. In December she sailed in chase to the West Indies. In May 1803 Captain Robert Stopford recommissioned Spencer. On 28 August Spencer recaptured the East Indiaman Lord Nelson. On 28 May she recaptured Castle Douglas, and the next month, on 10 June, she recaptured Lord North. On 20 November Spencer captured Virgin del Brien Consiglio, and then nine days later, Nostra Senora del Carmen, J. de Moro, Master. =San Domingo= Spencer joined Admiral Nelson off Toulon in August 1804. Spencer was then part of a squadron off Cadiz under Vice-admiral John Duckworth, when news reached Duckworth that two French squadrons had sailed from Brest in December 1805. Duckworth took his squadron to Barbados to search for them, eventually sighting Leissègues' squadron off San Domingo on 6 February 1806. Duckworth organised his ships into two lines, the weather line consisting of , and Spencer, while the lee line consisted of , , Donegal and . The lines moved to attack the French ships and the battle broke out. During the battle, Superb badly damaged the French 74-gun , leaving her adrift, her rigging shot off and her rudder destroyed. Spencer then took Indivisible. The battle was a victory for the Royal Navy, and Stopford and the other captains received a Naval Gold Medal for their actions. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"St. Domingo\\" to all surviving claimants from the battle; 396 medals were issued. Next, Stopford and Spencer participated in the British invasions of the Río de la Plata and Battle of Copenhagen. =Raid off Kristiansand= Spencer arrived off Kristiansand, Norway on 18 September 1807 with two other ships. The ships withdrew after they were fired on by Christiansholm Fortress. The ship's commander decided to occupy the abandoned Fredriksholm Fortress in the Kristiansand fjord, and demolish it. Charges were laid but after waiting some time for the explosion, men were sent back to check if the fuses had gone out. They had not, and four of the men were killed in the resulting explosion.[Hauschild Fredriksen, Karl: Hærens Artilleri i Kristiansandsområdet 1556-1995, 2007 in Norwegian] In April 1808 Captain John Quilliam took command and sailed Spencer in the Channel, where she served as the flagship for now Admiral Stopford. =War of 1812= Spencer underwent major repairs at Plymouth from October 1811 until March 1814. Captain Richard Raggett recommissioned her in January 1814 and during the War of 1812 sailed her to North America escorting a convoy to Canada. Later in 1814 he patrolled in the Gulf of Maine. After a failed and embarrassing September attempt to gain ransom from a little coaster out of Boston, Raggett turned his wrath on lightly defended Cape Cod towns. Eastham coughed up over $1,200 and Brewster paid $4,000 to avoid bombardment. Bolder people resided in Barnstable and Orleans. The two towns rejected Raggett's demands and prepared to resist. Raggett decided to move on, but locals tagged his ship with the nickname \\"Terror of the Bay\\". Earlier, Spencer shared in the capture of the American brigantine Superb. After a successful cruise in the summer of 1814 during which she captured the Royal Navy schooner , the American privateer Syren returned to the United States but as she approached the Delaware River the British blockading ships gave chase. To escape the boats of Spencer and , on 16 November Syren ran ashore under Cape May. Her crew set her on fire before making their escape. Post-war career From August 1815, Spencer served as a guardship in Plymouth under the command of Captain William Robert Broughton. On 16 March 1817, Wolf, a tender to Spencer, captured two smuggling boats, Albeona and Two Brothers, and their cargo. Wolf was in company with the revenue cruiser Vigilant. In 1818 Captain Sir Thomas Hardy replaced Broughton. Captain Samuel Rowley replaced Hardy in September. Spencer then served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Sir Josias Rowley at Cork. Sir Thomas Lavie replaced Rowley in turn in December 1821. Fate Spencer was broken up at Plymouth in April 1822.

The purpose of the student oath is to remind students of their obligations to their art, instructors, fellow students, people outside of their school, and to society at large. The oath is generally repeated at the beginning of class, after students “bow in”. Bowing-in is a process that usually includes bowing simultaneously to the International Taekwon-Do Federation flag or the ITF flag and the flag of the country in which the school is located, bowing to the head instructor, and finally, bowing to the instructors who will be conducting the class. Usually, the student oath is preceded by a recitation of a list of tenets of Taekwondo. The instructor typically would prompt the class to repeat the student oath and tenets of Taekwondo. The tenets of Taekwondo are often given in a list of five: courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control and indomitable spirit. Following recitation of the tenets, students then recite the student oath, as follows: * Observe the tenets of Taekwondo. * Respect all seniors and instructors. * Never misuse Taekwondo. * Be a champion of freedom and justice. * Help to build a more peaceful world. The tenets of Taekwon-Do are: * 1 Courtesy * 2 Integrity * 3 Perseverance * 4 Self-control * 5 Indomitable spirit This is normally done in ITF Taekwon-Do and other offshoot Taekwon-Do federations like the GTF or UITF. Notes The following is an example of the student oath, from the American Academy of Martial Arts (AAMA) school in Aberdeen, New Jersey. It embodies the key principles. \\"I come to you in peace and brotherhood for I have no weapons. But should I be forced to defend myself, my principles or my honor; should it be a matter of right or wrong; then here are my weapons - my empty hands and feet.\\" Sources *Tedeschi, Marc; (2003).

She was first commissioned in the following month under Sir Hyde Parker for the Spanish Armament but was not called into action. When the Russian Armament was resolved without conflict in August 1791, Brunswick took up service as a guardship in Portsmouth Harbour. She joined Richard Howe's Channel Fleet at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War and was present at the battle on Glorious First of June where she a fought a hard action against the French 74-gun Vengeur du Peuple. Brunswick was in a small squadron under William Cornwallis that encountered a large French fleet in June 1795. The British ships successfully retreated into the Atlantic through a combination of good seamanship, good fortune and deceiving the enemy. After a five-year spell in the West Indies, Brunswick returned home and was refitted at Portsmouth. In 1807, when Denmark was under threat from a French invasion, Brunswick was part of a task force, under overall command of James Gambier, sent to demand the surrender of the Danish fleet. When the Danes refused to comply, Brunswick joined in with an attack on the capital, Copenhagen. She returned to the Baltic some months later, following the Treaty of Tilsit and, while attached to Richard Goodwin Keats' squadron, she helped with the evacuation of 10,000 Spanish troops from the region. From 1812 Brunswick was on harbour service, and in 1826 she was broken up. Construction and armament Brunswick was a 74-gun, third-rate ship-of- the-line ordered on 7 January 1785. She was the first of her type built following the American Revolutionary war and was significantly larger than previous 74s. The Admiralty approved the design on 10 January 1785 and work began in May 1786 when her keel, of was laid down at Deptford. When finished, she was along the gun deck, had a beam of and a depth in the hold of . She was 1,828 tons burthen and drew between and .Winfield (2007) p. 89 The ship was initially designed to carry a main battery of twenty-eight guns on the lower deck and thirty on the upper deck, with a secondary armament of twelve guns on the quarter deck and four on the forecastle. She was launched on 30 April 1790 and taken down the Thames to Woolwich where she was fitted-out between 17 May and 18 June. Her build and first fitting cost the Admiralty £47,781.0.0d. In December 1806, Brunswick's armament was changed so that all her guns fired a shot. This meant that the guns on the lower deck were downgraded while those on the upperdeck were upgraded. The guns on the forecastle were replaced with two 24-pounder long guns and four 24-pounder carronades, and on the quarter deck, the twelve 9-pounders were removed to make way for two long guns and ten carronades, all 24-pounders. The great guns on the upper decks were mounted on Gover carriages which enabled them to be handled by fewer men.James (1802) p. 357 Career Brunswicks first captain, Sir Hyde Parker, was appointed in May 1790 during the Spanish Armament. At the end of that year he was superseded by Sir Roger Curtis, under whom Brunswick spent most of 1791 at Spithead until the settlement of the Russian Armament, without hostility, in late August. She then paid off, but was immediately recommissioned to serve as a guardship in Portsmouth Harbour, and continued in that role through 1792, except for a brief period spent in the \\"Evolution Squadron\\". On 29 October 1792, three condemned mutineers of the Mutiny on the Bounty were hanged from her yardarms.Barrow p. 271 Following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, Captain John Harvey took command of Brunswick, and saw service in the Channel Fleet under the overall command of Admiral Earl Howe. As part of this fleet, on 2May 1794, she accompanied the East and West India and Newfoundland convoys along the Channel as far as Lizard Point. Howe then divided his force, sending eight ships-of-the-line and four or five frigates to escort the convoys further while the remaining 26 ships-of-the-line, including Brunswick, set off to search for a large Franco-American grain convoy known to be heading for France.James (Vol. I), pp. 125–126 Howe realised that the French fleet at Brest would be detailed to escort the grain convoy through hostile waters. Having had two frigates confirm that the French fleet was still in port, Howe attempted to intercept the convoy in advance by placing his ships where he thought an encounter most likely. After thirteen days of searching however, the British fleet returned on 19May, to find the fleet in Brest gone. It had in fact passed close by the British ships, in thick fog, two days previously on 17 May.James (Vol. I), p. 126 On the evening of 19 May, Howe's fleet fell in with the fifth-rate , which had been attached to Rear-Admiral Sir George Montagu's squadron. Also searching for the convoy, Montagu had been cruising between Cape Ortugal and Belle-Isle, but knowing he would be hopelessly outnumbered, he had sent Venus to locate Howe and ask for reinforcements.James (Vol. I), p. 128 At 04:00 the next morning, Howe ordered all sail in an attempt to reach Montagu before the French. However, part of a Dutch convoy, which had been captured by the French on 19 May, was recaptured by the Howe's fleet on 21 May, and the former prisoners were able to provide information regarding the whereabouts of the French fleet. In light of this new information, Howe realised that Montagu was no longer in danger and altered course to pursue the French.James (Vol. I), p. 129 =First of June= The British and French fleets on the morning of 1June 1794James (Vol. I), p. 147 On 25 May a French ship was seen and followed, which after three days led the British to the main French fleet.James (Vol. I), p. 130 Howe gave the order to prepare for battle at 09:45 on 28May and at 10:35 to form into two columns. In an attempt to force an action, some of the fastest ships were sent to attack the French rear, which they did throughout the day, both causing and receiving some damage.James (Vol. I), pp. 130–131 The two fleets came together on 29May, and a limited engagement took place that petered out and became a general chase after an attempt to cut the French line was mistimed.James (Vol. I), pp. 136–137 Thick fog prevented any further action for the next two days.James (Vol. I), pp. 144–145 The weather cleared on the morning of 1 June, and both fleets were drawn up line ahead, sailing in the same direction, Brunswick in the centre, immediately behind Hood's flagship, the first-rate and in front of . At around 08:15 the order was given for each ship to bear down upon and engage her opposite number.James (Vol. I), pp. 146–147 Brunswick was one of three ships Howe signalled to put on more sail.James (Vol. I), p. 148 The tardiness of Brunswick and the 74-gun , on the other side of Queen Charlotte, meant that Howe found himself battling one 120-gun and two 80-gun ships simultaneously.James (Vol.I) pp. 148 - 150 Brunswick (centre), following her engagement with Vengeur du Peuple (left) and Achille (right), on 1 June 1794Gibraltar was, however, able to stop a fourth enemy ship, the first-rate Républicain, from joining in, by bringing down her main and mizzen masts from a distance, while Brunswick, having made all sail as directed, was close enough to draw the fire of the Vengeur du Peuple.James (Vol. I), p. 150 Unable to pass astern, Harvey had his ship come hard alongside and the two became locked together; the Brunswick's anchors fouling on Vengeur's fore-shrouds and channels.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 232 When asked whether they should attempt to cut Brunswick free, Harvey replied, \\"No, we have got her and we will keep her\\". The British, prevented from opening their lower gun ports by the pressure exerted by the hull of Vengeur du Peuple, simply shot through them and the two ships drifted out of the line as they exchanged broadsides.Clowes (Vol.IV) pp. 232 - 233 A while later, at 11:00, a second French ship, Achille, attempted to join the action but Brunswick shot away her only remaining mast, which fell over the side and obstructed her guns. Unable to return fire or manoeuvre, she was forced to strike. When it became apparent that she could not be taken possession of, Achille spread her spritsail, rehoisted her colours and tried to make her escape.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 233 Henry Harvey in then sailed to his brother's aid; raking Vengeur du Peuple twice and forcing the two ships apart, before turning to secure Achille.Clowes (Vol.IV) pp. 233-235 By the end of the action, Vengeur had sunk from the damage inflicted by Brunswick and six other French ships had been captured. The remainder escaped.James (Vol. I), p. 152 In the three engagements, it was estimated that French casualties were between 3,000 and 7,000 dead and wounded, while British losses were recorded as 290 dead and 858 wounded.James (Vol. I), pp. 152–153 Brunswick had been badly damaged; she had lost her mizzen mast completely, her yards were shattered and her sails and rigging had been shot away, 23 guns had been dismounted, she had been on fire three times and her starboard quarter gallery was missing. She drifted away to leeward of the retreating enemy fleet, but made all available sail to head northward for the safety of a home port.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 234 Having had 45 killed and 114 wounded, including Captain Harvey who died of the wounds later, Brunswick had suffered the highest casualty toll of any Royal Navy ship present at the battle. After Harvey had been carried below, Lieutenant William Edward Cracraft was made acting captain. Despite his own ship's condition, when the dismasted French ship Jemmapes was encountered, at 15:00, Cracraft had Brunswick hove to with the intention of engaging. Jemmapes however indicated that she had already struck.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 234 =Operations off Belle Ile= In 1795, Brunswick, under Captain Lord Charles Fitzgerald, was attached to William Cornwallis's squadron in the Channel. On the morning of 8 June, Cornwallis' force comprising five ships-of-the-line, two frigates and a small brig-sloop, was cruising southwards along the Breton coast and past the Penmarck Rocks, when at 10:30, HMS Triumph signalled the presence of six sails to the north-east. Cornwallis turned his squadron to investigate and discovered the ships were part of a large merchant convoy, escorted by three ships-of-the-line and six or seven frigates under the overall command of Contre-Amiral Jean Gaspard Vence.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 255 At first, the convoy sailed towards Cornwallis's squadron, believing it to be French. When the mistake was realised, at 12:00, Vence ordered his ships towards Belle Île, where they could shelter beneath the gun batteries. Cornwallis sent his fastest ships ahead, to engage the trailing ships of the convoy and try to force an action but, despite taking eight prizes, they were not able to do so.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 256 Prevented from pressing their attack by the shoal waters and batteries, the British anchored in the Palais Road, close to the island, where they remained until the following evening. On 9 June, they sailed into the Bay of Biscay and around Ushant headland, reaching the Scilly Isles on 11 June. The eight brigs taken off Belle Ile and two American vessels captured after, were at that point, sent into Spithead under escort off the 18-gun . The remaining ships turned back towards Belle Île, in the hope that by then, Vence's squadron would be in open water.James (Vol.I) p. 237 Cornwallis's Retreat, June 17, 1795, Thomas Luny On 15 June, Vence's squadron was sailing off the island of Groix, when it encountered a French fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse, which had sailed from Brest on 12 June and comprised nine ships-of-the-line, nine frigates (including two ships of the line razeed into 50-gun frigates) and four corvettes. The two forces joined and turned north. On 16 June, the French fleet was off Penmarck Point when, at 10:30, Cornwallis's squadron was spotted to the north-west.James (Vol.I) p. 238 Cornwallis was anticipating Vence's merchant convoy which had arrived at its destination some days previous, and did not immediately understand the danger his squadron was in. , having been sent ahead to investigate, added to the confusion when she signalled to Cornwallis that the French fleet contained 30 vessels, but did not return. This caused Cornwallis to take the signal to mean that the French ships, while more numerous, were inferior in strength.James (Vol.I) pp. 238 - 239Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 256 At 11:00, seeing that Cornwallis was still advancing, Phaeton signalled the exact composition of Villaret's fleet. The British squadron, now realising the danger, turned away to the south-west, with Brunswick leading the line and the French in pursuit. Having followed the British out into the Atlantic, at 14:00, Villaret's fleet divided with one part sailing north to cut Cornwallis off, while the other maintained its course to the south. By 18:00 the northern squadron had overhauled the British who found themselves directly between the two French divisions, no more than from each.James (Vol.I) p. 239 The chase continued into the night with Brunswick and struggling to keep station. In an effort to increase their speed, the two ships jettisoned their anchors, boats and much of their provisions. Bellerophon was sailing so slowly that her captain, James Cranstoun, ordered four carronades and a large amount of roundshot to be thrown over the side. At 09:00, Zélé, the leading French ship in the windward squadron was close enough to open to fire on the British rearguard ship, . The action was soon joined by the 40-gun frigate Virginie which came up on Mars port quarter. Concerned that Bellerophon, which was close by, might lose a sail, a loss she could not sustain, Cornwallis ordered and to drop back and allow Bellerophon to join Brunswick at the front.James (Vol.I) p. 249 This reorganisation of the line slowed the entire squadron and put all the ships in range of the French vanguard. The British cut holes in the stern planks of their ships to allow more cannon to be trained on Villaret's advancing fleet. This tactic appeared to be successful, and at 13:30, the leading French ship was forced to fall back when she lost her main topgallant mast.Clowes (Vol.IV) pp. 257 - 258 The French continued their attack on the British rear and, after a further four hours, Mars began to fall away to leeward. Seeing this, Royal Sovereign and Triumph yawed, raking the four French ships heading to cut her off and take possession of her.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 257 This action caused the French ships to haul to wind and Mars was able to rejoin her squadron. A more distant engagement then took place which petered out just after 18:30 when the French broke off the attack and turned away to the east. Phaeton, some miles ahead, had spent all day signalling to an imaginary fleet over the horizon. By coincidence at 18:00 four small sail appeared in the distance which, coupled with Phaeton's ruse de guerre was enough to convince Villaret that the British fleet was arriving.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 259James (Vol.I) pp. 240 - 241 =Service in the West Indies= Later in June 1795, William Browell became Brunswick's captain and she served as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Richard Rodney Bligh. She sailed to the Windward Islands the following year, carrying Bligh who had been appointed second in command there. She arrived at Martinique in September but then immediately left for Jamaica; Bligh having received orders to take command of that station until the arrival of Hyde Parker.The Naval Chronicle (Vol.13) p. 429 In 1797, Brunswick was in the Leeward Islands under captain William Gordon Rutherford. While cruising with her squadron, between 26 June and 21 July 1797, Brunswick captured a Spanish schooner on its way from St Domingo to Jamaica and detained a vessel under Danish colours which was travelling between St Thomas and New Orleans. In the following three months, she took a second Spanish schooner, out of La Guaira, a Danish schooner bound for Charleston and a Danish brig on its way to St Thomas. American and Spanish brigs were taken between the end of 1799 and the following February. Another Spanish schooner was apprehended between February and May 1800. In September Brunswick returned to England and paid off. She was refitted at Portsmouth between February and April the following year. =Attack on Copenhagen= The 1807 bombardment of Copenhagen by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg In 1807, with Denmark under threat from Napoleon's forces, Brunswick took part in an expedition to prevent the Danish fleet falling into French hands.James (Vol.IV) p. 288 Following the defeat of Prussia in December 1806, Denmark's continuing independence looked increasingly fragile. It was feared that Denmark, under pressure from France, might deny Britain access to the Baltic Sea, something the British believed vital for trade as well as being a major source of the raw materials required for building and maintaining their warships. Brunswick was one of 17 ships-of-the-line, together with 21 smaller vessels, sent to demand the surrender of the Danish fleet. Under overall command of James Gambier, the British fleet left Great Yarmouth on 26 July.James (Vol.IV) p. 284 On arrival off Gothenburg, on 1 August, Gambier despatched four ships-of-the-line and two frigates to guard the Great Belt and stop reinforcements being brought in from Holstein, where a Danish army of 24,000 was camped. Brunswick remained with the main force.James (Vol.IV) p. 285 Over the next twelve days more ships arrived, swelling the British force to 25 ships-of-the-line, 40 smaller warships, and 377 transports carrying 27,000 troops.James (Vol.IV) pp. 285 - 286 On 10 August, having refused initial demands by the British, the Danes made further preparations to defend their city – already heavily fortified with 174 guns of 24 and 36lb, and 25 of the largest calibre mortars available.James (Vol.IV) p. 286 Additionally, and separate from the fleet moored in the harbour, a 64-gun blockship guarded the entrance with four 20-gun prames, two floating batteries and 25–30 gunboats. There were 5,500 troops stationed in Copenhagen and around 3,000 sailors. A contingent of 3,500 armed civilians also remained but the rest of the population was evacuated, while negotiations with the British continued. Copenhagen after the bombardment painted by J. D. Moller Although no formal state of war existed at the time, on 13 August, a seventy-four and a sloop of war from Gambier's fleet pursued and, eventually, engaged and captured the Danish frigate, . On 16 August the King of Denmark ordered that all British vessels should be seized and detained; and on 17 August, Danish gunboats left the harbour and set fire to an English merchant barque.James (Vol.IV) p. 288 The British landed a contingent of troops 12 miles north of the city on 16 August, the fleet returning to Copenhagen later the following day, where Gambier issued a retaliatory proclamation that all Danish vessels were to be detained. Brunswick was soon in accord through the capture of two enemy craft. Further skirmishes occurred between 18–21 August while the British landed their remaining troops, invested the island with their ships and instituted a close blockade. As the troops moved to lay siege to the city and construct batteries, they received heavy fire from Danish gunboats, which in turn were harassed by the smaller ships from the British fleet.James (Vol.IV) p. 289 By 1 September, the French had arrived at Strasland and Gambier was obliged to send more of his ships to blockade the port and prevent the passage of reinforcements to Zealand. Having now completed batteries for 48 mortars and howitzers plus twenty 24lb long guns, the commander of the British army, William Cathcart, and Gambier made a final appeal to the Danes, this time offering to return the ships at the end of hostilities. An agreement could not be reached, however, and the following day the British opened fire on the city.James (Vol.IV) p. 290 The bombardment continued, on and off, until 5 September, during which time much of the city had been destroyed. The terms of the capitulation were ratified on 7 September and the British occupied the city while the ships of the Danish fleet were either removed or destroyed.James (Vol.IV) pp. 291 - 292 Of the prizes taken, 18 were ships-of- the-line, 10 were frigates and 14 were sloops-of-war, including . In addition, 25 gunboats were confiscated.James (Vol.IV) p. 292 =Return to the Baltic= Following the Treaty of Tilsit, Russia became an enemy of the United Kingdom and Sweden,Harvey p. 529 and in May 1808, Brunswick was sent back to the Baltic; part of a fleet, under James Saumarez.James (Vol.V) p. 12 While attached to Richard Goodwin Keats' squadron in August, Brunswick assisted in the evacuation of 10,000 Spanish troops from the region.James (Vol.V) p. 18 Initially fighting for Napoleon in Northern Germany and Denmark, the Spaniards had changed allegiance following the occupation of their country by the French. Keats in , accompanied by Brunswick, and five or six smaller vessels were in close proximity at the time and were contacted by the Spanish commander-in-chief, the Marquis de la Romana, with a view to joining forces.James (Vol.V) p. 17 On 9 August a plan was formulated for the Spaniards to seize the fort and town of Nyborg, allowing Keats' squadron to take possession of the port and organise the evacuation. The Danes were informed that, providing they did not interfere with the operation, the town would be spared. All were in agreement except for the captains of a 16-gun brig and a 12-gun cutter, who positioned their vessels across the harbour entrance. These were captured by British sailors in a cutting-out expedition and taken into service as and . Prevented from taken his squadron into the harbour by contrary winds, Keats had 57 local boats loaded with the Spaniards' stores and artillery and taken to Slipshavn, four miles to the south-east, where, on 11 August, the troops were able to embark. Fate In 1812 Brunswick was on harbour service, and she was broken up in 1826.Lavery (2003), p. 185.

She was designed by Sir William Rule, and was the only ship built to her draught. French Revolutionary Wars In 1799, she sailed to the Mediterranean as part of a squadron under Sir Charles Cotton. In February 1801 she was part of a squadron under Sir John Warren off Cadiz. Because Dragon served in the navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants. Napoleonic Wars In April 1803, Dragon was sailing from Gibraltar to Britain in company with and the store ship Prevoyante when they sighted two French ships of the line off Cape St. Vincent. The French ships veered off rather than engage the British vessels.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.337. On 18 June 1803, Dragon and captured the French naval 12-gun brig Colombe. Colombe was copper-bottomed and pierced for 16 guns. She had a crew of 65 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Caro. Colombe had been returning from Martinique and was bound for Brest when the British captured her off Ouessant. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Colombe.

In September 1810 she commissioned as the flagship of Sir F. la Faey and she sailed for the Leeward Islands in October 1810. On 18 October 1810, Dragon was in Hamoaze. There she ran into and dismasted the brig Eliza Ann, Rees, master, which had been sailing from Neath to London. Lloyd's List, 23 October 1810. - accessed 10 November 2013. War of 1812 Dragon participated in the War of 1812 with the United States, under the command of Robert Barrie, and took part in a number of engagements. She also captured a number of vessels. On 12 September 1812, Dragon captured Anna Maria. On 20 or 22 December, Dragon destroyed the American privateer Tartar, of ten guns and 47 men. In August 1814, Dragon took part in an expedition up the Penobscot River in Maine. The first ships to go were , Dragon, , , , as well as some transports. , , , and joined on the 31st. On the evening of 31 August, Sylph, Peruvian, and the transport Harmony, accompanied by a boat from Dragon, embarked marines, foot soldiers and a detachment from the Royal Artillery, to move up the Penobscot under the command of Captain Robert Barrie of Dragon. The objective was the American frigate , of twenty-six 18-pounder guns, which had taken refuge some 27 miles up stream at Hampden, Maine. Here Adams had landed her guns and fortified a position on the bank with fifteen 18-pounders commanding the river. Moving up the river took two days, but eventually, after the Battle of Hampden, the British were able to capture the American defenders at Bangor, though not until after the Americans had burnt the Adams. The British also captured 11 other ships and destroyed six. The British lost only one man killed, a sailor from Dragon, and had several soldiers wounded.The Anglo-American Magazine, (Toronto: Maclear), Vol. 5, pp.418-9.

He fought at the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo where he commanded the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Dutch Division and became a Chief Commander of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Early life Prince Bernhard, the seventh child of Charles Augustus, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, was born on 30 May 1792 in Weimar. He enlisted in the Prussian army and in 1806 he fought in the army of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen. By 1809 he had enlisted in the Saxon army and he fought under Marshal Bernadotte at Wagram. Waterloo campaign Prince Bernhard's 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Dutch Division (Sedlnitsky) was the first of the Duke of Wellington's forces to arrive at the cross roads of Quatre Bras. Prince Bernhard's brigade (joined later by the 1st Brigade,) held the cross roads at Quatre Bras for almost 24 hours from the late afternoon of 15 June 1815, until about 3 p.m. on the 16 June, preventing Marshal Michel Ney with the left wing of the French L'Armée du Nord from taking the cross roads before the Duke of Wellington and substantial allied forces arrived to reinforce the 2nd Division and fight the Battle of Quatre Bras. The successful holding action by the two brigades of the Dutch 2nd Division was one of the most important actions by any of the coalition brigades in the whole of the Waterloo Campaign. At the Battle of Waterloo Prince Bernhard commanded the allied forces holding the farms of Papelotte, Frischermont and La Haie on the extreme left of the Duke of Wellington's line of battle.The Battle of Waterloo They were strategically important, not just because if the forces holding these positions gave way then the French could out flank Wellington, but because it was from that direction that Wellington expected and received Prussian support. Though in the course of the battle Durutte’s 4th French Division obtained a temporary foothold in Papelotte, it was never captured Commander of the Dutch East Indies Army Bernhard was appointed commander of the Dutch East Indies Army on December 6, 1848 and arrived on April 14, 1849 in Java. Barely a few weeks after his arrival, the commander of the third Balinese expedition, General Andreas Victor Michiels was killed at Kasumba; and Saxe-Weimar offered to the Governor-General to take over the leadership of the expedition, acting according to the rules that had been given to General Michiels. In the winter of 1849 he was promoted to general of the infantry and three years later (1852) he returned to the Netherlands, for his health, after many improvements and having accomplished to restore the East Indies army. He received on October 5, 1853 an honorable retirement. Later life and family Prince Bernhard traveled extensively in the United States in 1825–26. A heavily edited account of his travels, Reise sr. Hoheit des Herzogs Bernhard zu Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach durch Nord-Amerika, was published by the historian Heinrich Luden in 1828. The work was translated into English and published in Philadelphia, also in 1828, as Travels through North America, during the Years 1825 and 1826. A critical edition of the original manuscript became available in 2017. Karel Bernhard van Saksen-Weimar-Eisenach Memorial in The Hague In the years after Waterloo, Bernhard distinguished himself as commander of a Dutch Division in the Belgian campaign of 1831 (the Ten Days Campaign), and from 1847 to 1850 held the command of the forces in the Dutch East Indies. He died 21 July 1862 in Liebenstein. He married Princess Ida of Saxe-Meiningen, daughter of Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, on 30 May 1816 in Meiningen. Prince Bernhard's son, William Augustus Edward, known as Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar (1823–1902), entered the British army, served with much distinction in the Crimean War, became colonel of the 1st Life Guards, and later a British Field Marshal.

All the Cosina Voigtländer Bessa models have a double focal-plane shutter with two sets of curtains to prevent damage by the sun. Shutter speeds range from 1 to 1/2000 s and bulb (B), with flash sync at 1/125 s on hot-shoe or PC terminal. They all have TTL exposure metering, and manual exposure; the recent R2A and R3A also have an aperture priority automatic mode. Bessa-L and Bessa-T (finderless) Bessa-L The first model was the Bessa-L, introduced in 1999. This was a finderless body with a Leica screw mount. It was introduced with a range of Voigtländer 39 mm screw lenses that were quite inexpensive and said to be of excellent quality. It could of course mount all the wide variety of 39 mm screw lenses by manufacturers as diverse as Leica, Canon, Nikon and even cheaper but often excellent Soviet lenses. The Bessa-L was mostly intended to be used with ultra wide angle lenses, with which the absence of a focusing device is not a problem. Most notably Voigtländer introduced a 15 mm and a 12 mm lens, the latter being the widest rectilinear full-frame lens ever marketed up to then. The Bessa-L has TTL metering with LED readout on the back edge of the top plate with an ASA range of 25–1600 and an EV range 1 to 19 at ASA 100. The readout consists of two red arrows pointing to a green light in between to indicate over, under, or correct exposure. On some markets, the Voigtländer Bessa-L was sold as the Cosina 107-SW. The Bessa-L was supplemented in 2001 by the Bessa-T, which used the Leica M-mount, could receive a trigger advance design, and had an integrated rangefinder with high magnification, but no viewfinder. It was sold in silver or black; from 2002, also in gray or olive (at a higher price and perhaps only in Japan). It is now discontinued but some stock is still available. In 2001, the Bessa-T was sold in a special kit, called Heliar 101st Anniversary (in short \\"T101\\"), with a 50 mm f:3.5 collapsible Heliar lens, for the anniversary of the Voigtländer Heliar lens design. It existed in black, grey, olive and blue: five hundred numbered examples were produced for each color. Bessa-R and Bessa R2 (manual rangefinder) Bessa R2 The Bessa-R, introduced in 2000, was a rangefinder camera with a projected frame finder and a Leica screw mount. Although considerably cheaper than a Leica M camera, its viewfinder was comparable in function and feeling. It featured manually selectable frames for 35 mm/90 mm, 50 mm, and 75 mm lenses. The body, made of polycarbonate plastics, was not comparable to that of a Leica but was solid enough. All in all it was an inexpensive, all-manual rangefinder with TTL metering at a significantly lower price than a comparably equipped Leica M camera. It was available in black or silver; from 2002, also in navy blue or olive (at a higher price and perhaps only in Japan). The Bessa R2 replaced the Bessa-R in 2002. It was an updated version, with a Leica M-mount replacing the Leica screw mount, and the ability to take the same trigger advance accessory as the Bessa-T. Its quality of fabrication and overall finish was much better than the R, with magnesium alloy replacing the former model's plastic plates and a more substantial cast (as opposed to pressed) metal film rewind lever. The changes resulted in a more solid and marginally larger camera, available in either olive (with chrome detailing) or splatter-textured black paint finishes. The Bessa-R's self-timer was deleted from the R2, possibly due to the packaging constraints imposed on the design by the adoption of thicker metal panels. Rollei 35 RF The names Cosina, Voigtländer and Bessa appear nowhere on the Rollei 35 RF (2002), marketed not by Cosina but instead by Rollei Fototechnic. But this camera is very obviously based on the Bessa R2. The most obvious differences are the price (much higher) and somewhat gaudy appearance; more importantly the framelines are for 40, 50, and 80 mm. Arguably it remains the best Bessa camera for people who wear glasses and primarily use a 40 mm lens. Bessa-R2S and Bessa-R2C (Nikon and Contax mount) Bessa-R2C The Bessa-R2S and Bessa-R2C are special versions of the Bessa R2, introduced in 2002, the Bessa-R2S having a Nikon rangefinder mount and the Bessa-R2C a Contax rangefinder mount. They are both discontinued today but stock is still available. At about the time in 2005 when discontinuation of these two models was announced, the Bessa-R2S was also available in a \\"Nikon Historical Society\\" (NHS) version with special paintwork and a rigid version of the Heliar 50 mm lens sold earlier with the Bessa-T. The set was (and as of May 2006 still is) available to the general public through regular retail channels in the US: Society membership is not required.\\"Bessa-R2S 'NHS' kinen moderu ga Amerika de hatsubai\\". Bessa R2A and R3A (auto-exposure rangefinder) Bessa R2A The Bessa R2A and Bessa R3A, both introduced in 2004, are the current models in the Bessa line. They are both updated versions of the Bessa R2, with the Leica M-mount and an aperture- priority automatic exposure, switchable to manual. The R2A has a finder with a 0.7x magnification, and 35/50/75/90 frame lines. The R3A has a finder with a 1x magnification, and 40/50/75/90 frame lines. Both can take the trigger advance accessory. They are currently sold in textured black or flat grey paint finishes. These cameras feature an electronic shutter, making the camera inoperable without batteries. Bessa R2M and R3M (manual rangefinder) The Bessa R2M and Bessa R3M, both announced in Germany around March 2006 and in May elsewhere, are the current, manual-exposure, mechanical-shutter equivalents of the R2A and R3A. A special 250th Anniversary Set, sold with a 50 mm M-mount collapsible Heliar lens, was also announced. They were sold in black (1000 examples of the R3M, 500 of the R2M) or silver (700 of the R3M, 300 of the R2M). The Bessa R3m has a 1x viewfinder and 40/50/75/90 framelines. The internal meter requires batteries to operate but since the camera is mechanical it can still take pictures with no batteries. Bessa R4M and R4A (wide-angle rangefinder) Announced in October, 2006 at photokina, the Bessa R4M and Bessa R4A were the first Leica M-mount cameras to include framelines wider than 28 mm. The R4-series keeps the same features as the R3-series, but utilizes a wide-angle-specific viewfinder with .52x magnification and framelines for 21, 25, 28, 35, and 50 mm lenses. Like the previous limited edition R-series cameras, the R4A features aperture-priority autoexposure, while the R4M features full manual operation, including a mechanical shutter that will continue to work even if the battery (which powers the meter) is dead. The R4M is available in the classic black of the R2 and R3-series, while the R4A is available in matte black.

He studied in Geneva, where he was a pupil of Friedrich Klose, and continued his studies in Vienna and then Karlsruhe under Felix Mottl before becoming conductor of the theatre orchestras in Landshut and Lübeck. In 1897 he moved to Munich, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Here he taught harmony and composition. Among his pupils was Wilhelm Petersen. He was also the music critic for the newspaper Münchner Neueste Nachrichten. An advocate of the latest trends in music as exemplified by his friends Ludwig Thuille and Richard Strauss, he published books on Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz, Anton Bruckner, Hans Pfitzner, Klose and contemporary German music. With Ludwig Thuille he wrote an influential manual on harmony, Harmonielehre (1907), which went through many editions. He had an acrimonious relationship with the composer Max Reger, of whose compositions he usually had negative opinions. After the first performance of Reger's Sinfonietta on 2 February 1906, Louis wrote a typically negative review in the Münchener Neueste Nachrichten on 7 February. Reger wrote to him: Ich sitze in dem kleinsten Zimmer in meinem Hause. Ich habe Ihre Kritik vor mir. Im nächsten Augenblick wird sie hinter mir sein (I am sitting in the smallest room of my house.

It is based on the manga and anime called The Three-Eyed One. The main character is Hosuke Sharaku. There is also a Mitsume ga Tooru game for the original MSX called Mitsume ga Tooru: The Three-Eyed One Comes Here, which was released by Natsume two years before this one.  Plot  The player controls Hosuke Sharaku, the last Three-eyed man. In the intro we see another Three-eyed man, Prince Godaru, riding on the ancient tank Gomorrah. Godaru destroys a part of the city then kidnaps Sharaku's friend, Wato Chiyoko.  Gameplay  The game contains five levels with different designs and a boss in the end of every stage. The player's character can shoot and jump; and also summon the Red Condor (Akai Condor). The Red Condor is an important weapon during the game. It can be used as a jumping platform if you jump on the top of the spear, or it can simply attack the enemies (doing double damage). The basic weapon is a regular bullet. It goes straight forward with medium speed. You can buy three additional types of bullets with different advantages and disadvantages. To buy weapons and other things (like life) you need gold coins. The gold coins are dropped by defeated enemies, and the value of coins can be increased by shooting them. The Levels: Level 1 The main hero, Hosuke, searches for his girlfriend on the streets of the city, takes a ride on the roof of a truck and has his battle in the stock yard. In the end of the level Hosuke takes on the first boss called Goblin, who can only be hit when he is caught off-guard. Level 2 Hosuke fights in a jungle and in an extended cave full of different creatures. At the end of the level he has to defeat the giant alien plant, Borubokka. Level 3 Now the main hero has to go through an ancient pyramid and there are catacombs full of danger. He must be careful of spikes and other fatal traps. Level 4 Hosuke sails on a motorboat to an abandoned ship. After getting to the other end of the ship, he has to defeat a large ghost formed of dozens vicious fireflies. Level 5 Hosuke enters the Sodom, which divides into three sub-sections. After travelling through all of the three sub-sections with three sub-bosses and riding an elevator to the surface, Hosuke fights against Gomorrah, then he finally finds Godaru, the prince of the Three-eyed ones.

It is situated 35 kilometres east of Kyle of Lochalsh standing in an isolated position at the western end of Loch Mullardoch, ten kilometres from any public road.  Overview  An Riabhachan reaches a height of 1129 metres (3704 feet) and is one of the highest Munros north of the Great Glen. The mountain's name originates from the Gaelic language and translates as “The Brindled One” which is believed to refer to the flecked effect given by the stone studded turf on the hill.\\"The Magic of the Munros\\" Page 148 Gives details of translated name.  Geography  An Riabhachan is a mainly grassy mountain. The only rocky area is at the north-east end of the summit ridge, above the fine craggy coire of Coire Gnada containing the lochans of Loch Mòr and Loch Beag. The east ridge links to the adjacent Munro of Sgurr na Lapaich and follows the steep edge above Coire Gnada. The mountain has a 2.5km long summit ridge which does not drop below 1000 metres throughout its length and contains three other high points. At the north east end of the summit ridge is the NE Top with a height of 1125 metres. In the 1921 revision of Munro's Tables it was named as the principal summit of the mountain, but reverted to the current summit in the 1933 and subsequent editions. It was deleted from the list of Munro Tops in 1997.The Munros and Tops 1891-1997. Spreadsheet giving details of changes in successive editions of Munro's Tables. With the demise of the NE Top, An Riabhachan has been left with just two subsidiary Tops. The West Top with a height of 1040 metres stands at the western end of the summit ridge, before descending to the Bealach Bholla and reascending to the adjoining Munro of An Socach. The South West Top lies 700m SE of the West Top and has a height of 1086 metres.Database of British and Irish Hills. Retrieved 19 February 2012. The summit ridge falls away on both sides over grassy slopes to Loch Mullardoch to the south and to the upper part of Glen Strathfarrar to the north.  Ascents  The mountain is usually climbed together with two or three of the other Munros on the north side of Loch Mullardoch. The most convenient ascent of all four Munros starts at the Mullardoch dam in Glen Cannich (grid reference ) and proceeds 9km along the loch's northern shore before climbing An Socach, continuing to An Riabhachan and returning via Sgurr na Lapaich and Càrn nan Gobhar. The long walk along the shore can be bypassed by hiring a boat, currently available between 1 April and 1 August.http://www.scottishsport.co.uk/walking/mullardoch.htm Contact details for boatman. The walk can be shortened by omitting An Socach, but it is better to include it if you can as there is no easier access to this remote Munro. The alternative route starts in Glen Strathfarrar to the north at the hydroelectric power station in Gleann Innis (grid reference ), reached by a 17-mile drive from Struy along a private road; the locked gate at the entrance to this road is opened at specified times to give access to vehicles.Strathfarrar Access Arrangements From the power station a stalkers' path leads to the Bealach Toll an Lochain between An Riabhachan and Sgurr na Lapaich, from where there is a further climb west of over 300 metres to reach the summit. A return to the power station can be made over Sgurr na Lapaich and Càrn nan Gobhar.

Crocker gained fame in September 2007 from his viral video \\"Leave Britney Alone!\\", in which he tearfully defended pop singer Britney Spears' comeback performance at the MTV Video Music Awards; his video received over four million views in two days. The video gained international media attention, hundreds of parodies, along with criticism for Crocker. Producing and acting in his own videos, Crocker is a self-described edutainer. In almost all of his adolescent works, he presents himself as an openly gay and effeminate Southerner in a \\"small-minded town\\" in the Bible Belt. Using \\"Crocker\\" as a stage name, he kept his exact location private due to safety concerns and death threats in response to his YouTube and Myspace video blogs and profile until he was no longer a teenager. According to his Myspace profile, Crocker lived in Los Angeles as of January 2008. In May 2010, he returned home to Tennessee, and now travels to Los Angeles for business. Crocker's work consists mainly of short-form, self-directed monologues shot in his grandparents' home. , his videos had received a combined 50 million plays on MySpace, and his vlog channel on YouTube was the 100th-most viewed of all time in all categories, with over 205 million video views, before Crocker closed his YouTube account in September 2015. Crocker's detractors and critics have accused him of narcissism, melodramatics, histrionics, and using Spears' personal shortcomings to bolster his own fame. Others have accused Crocker of acting in the \\"Leave Britney Alone!\\" video, although he insisted it was genuine on a September 2007 appearance on Maury Povich's Maury show. In 2014, Queerty stated that with Crocker's thousands of Facebook and Twitter followers, he is \\"one of those self-invented social media icons\\". Early life Crocker was born in East Tennessee to a teenage couple and was raised by his grandparents. Crocker said he \\"raised eyebrows\\" by bringing Barbie dolls to kindergarten for show and tell rather than the toys or action figures more conventionally associated with boys. Crocker continued to live in Tennessee throughout his youth, and was homeschooled in response to constant \\"death threats, bullying and glares at his clothes and makeup\\" specifically after allegedly being \\"harassed by a homophobic high school gym coach\\". Crocker lived with his fundamentalist Pentecostal grandparents who continued raising him when his teenage parents were not able. While his grandfather reportedly knows little about his Internet fame, his grandmother has reluctantly appeared in some of his videos. Vlogging career =Style and following= Crocker's uncensored vlogging has been attributed to his isolation as an \\"effeminate, Southern, flamboyantly gay\\" adolescent in a \\"small-minded town\\" in the Bible Belt.\\" His sexual orientation and outspokenness have been described as a \\"subtext... rarely addressed directly and never completely accepted\\" in his hometown. According to Crocker, when his grandmother found out that he was gay, she initially \\"said that [he] needed an exorcism\\". Crocker has further commented on his town's lack of gay culture, saying, \\"The only gay pride parade where I live is in my bedroom\\" as he held up a rainbow frosted cupcake. He added, \\"We don't have pride and rainbows here. We have MySpace. We don't have bathhouses, we have outhouses.\\" Crocker's earliest experience with online networking was as an editor of an e-zine, where he met his first boyfriend, with whom he was only able to interact online and by phone. Crocker later found another online forum, where his acting skills helped him blend in on a free phone party line run out of Los Angeles \\"filled with flaming black men, black drag queens, and trannies from Compton\\", where he was outed as white and dubbed \\"cracker\\". In June 2006, Crocker began uploading self-produced videos, characterized as his \\"singularly bizarre and angry take on gay life and his intolerant town\\". Although his video defending Britney Spears drew the attention of the wider public, Crocker had already become one of the most-watched video producers on MySpace and YouTube, having gathered what MSNBC described as a \\"cult following\\". Prior to Crocker's defense of Spears, some of the more than sixty videos he had posted to the two social networking websites had already been viewed more than a million times each, and his YouTube channel was in the top rankings. Some of the videos were only posted on one site or the other, many becoming \\"viral video hits\\". In May 2007, Crocker was the subject of a lengthy profile in the Seattle alternative weekly The Stranger, which discussed his Internet fame prior to and after the \\"Leave Britney Alone!\\" video, and the adversities he has faced. Dave Schlenker of the newspaper considered him bold and seething \\"flares sent up by a young gay man marooned in a sea of rednecks\\" who is stuck in a small town that \\"can't tolerate homosexuality and punishes flamboyance.\\" He stated that Crocker's videos include \\"sex-filled confessions\\" and \\"wild monologues\\" talking \\"about everything from AIDS to pubic hair.\\" In many of the videos, he portrays characters, such as an older deeply religious woman in \\"The Earl Annie Edna show\\" series and exaggerated comic characterizations of Southern stereotypes. = \\"Leave Britney Alone!\\" = Crocker at the 2008 Florida Supercon Convention Crocker is best known for his Britney Spears video, uploaded to YouTube on September 10, 2007. The first part of the infamous work was posted September 9, 2007 called \\"Leave Britney Alone pt.1\\" to his MySpace page, while the better-known \\"LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!\\" (part 2) was posted to both Myspace and YouTube. In \\"Leave Britney Alone pt.1\\", an emotional Crocker stated that he did not want fellow Southerner Britney Spears to spiral out of control like Anna Nicole Smith, who had died in February 2007. , the video had been viewed over 35 million times and had accumulated a total of over 500,000 comments. It is just a few seconds shorter than the second part, and Crocker, although emotional, remains relatively calm and composed, becoming teary only at the very end. In the videos, Crocker condemns gossip columnists such as Perez Hilton and reality TV star Simon Cowell who criticized Britney Spears' onstage music performance at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards in Las Vegas. Within the first 24 hours of its posting, the video had accumulated over 2 million views. , it had accumulated a total of 24 million views and was the second-most discussed video of all time on the site (in all categories), with over 350,000 comments. \\"LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!\\" was one of YouTube's fastest \\"climbing\\" videos, reaching the minimum seven million views needed () to be included in the \\"Top 100\\". The video was nominated in the Commentary category in the 2007 YouTube Awards. The video received worldwide attention and earned Crocker interviews on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, The Today Show, Maury, The Howard Stern Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Ryan Seacrest's KIIS-FM morning show. Crocker and his video were also commented on in the mainstream media by shows like The View and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. YouTube said \\"the melodramatic two-minute clip made Crocker an instant YouTube star\\" and named it one of the top videos of 2007. Wired magazine named it the top video of 2007. Although sometimes shown in conjunction with news footage of Spears' performance, the \\"pure performance art\\" video became its own story, with the news media and the gossip industry offering opinions on the phenomenon, joking that Crocker could be \\"an insidious satiric mastermind\\" and comparing him to Andy Kaufman. In the video, Crocker proclaims, \\"All you people care about is readers and making money off of her. She's a human! Leave Britney alone!\\" Crocker stated that although he is often acting in his videos, his emotions were genuine and \\"straight from the heart\\"; although he described the clip as a \\"second take\\" in one interview, he clarified on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that he meant that it was the second part of a longer video, the first part being \\"Leave Britney Alone pt. 1\\". The \\"Leave Britney Alone!\\" video became a satire target, with parody videos, references in mainstream television spoofs, and films. Actor Seth Green's parody, which included him applying eyeliner several times and promoting his show Robot Chicken, called for people to \\"leave Chris Crocker alone!\\" Some video responses characterized Crocker as a drama queen, and Wired magazine stated that the video \\"sent world Schadenfreude levels zooming to heights unseen since the Fatty Arbuckle scandal.\\" The January 2008 parody film Meet the Spartans used pop culture references and met with generally poor reviews; the Electronic Urban Report called Crocker's cameo the \\"film's funniest moment\\". Both Crocker and the video were also parodied in the South Park episode \\"Canada on Strike,\\" with a cartoon Crocker running around in a fight between various Internet memes, telling them to \\"leave the others alone\\". In March 2008, a \\"trance remix\\" dance single \\"Leave Britney Alone\\" was released on iTunes and other sites by \\"Double J\\" featuring quotes from Crocker's video. Crocker in 2009 While numerous news and media outlets reported on the viral video, Fox News Channel's morning program Fox & Friends commentators questioned Crocker's gender and compared the fabric backdrop in his video to Osama bin Laden's videos. Crocker produced two response videos – Poor FOX \\"News\\".. and Rosie O'Donnell was right about FOX \\"News\\" (originally posted as \\"Dear Fox 'News'\\") – addressing what he characterized as biased treatment while he called Fox News the \\"Republican, conservative, homophobic channel\\". Crocker's stated concerns were the commentators calling him a \\"she/he\\" and what he felt was their needless questioning of his gender instead of commenting on the content of his video. =Onch promotional deal and lawsuit= In October 2007, TMZ.com reported that Crocker was being sued by Onch Movement Jewelry for $1 million for fraud and breach of contract, and provided a copy of the civil complaint filed in Los Angeles. Jewelry designer Nelson Chung, professionally known as Onch and a fan of Crocker, hired him as a celebrity spokesmodel for more than two days' worth of publicity work as well as appearance at World of Wonder's Just Britney art show in exchange for airfare. It was speculated by DMW Media that Crocker had no legal representative as the agreement seemed unbalanced. Crocker did make appearances including at gay club Rage and the art show where he was interviewed by MTV showing artwork of him in homage to Spears. Onch's YouTube channel also posted videos of appearances which were later removed. Link too recent for Internet archiving use. Other career opportunities and appearances =General= Hamtramck, Michigan in October 2007 Crocker has been involved in various projects. In a June 2007 autobiographical comic strip, where Crocker discusses future plans, he states, \\"I'm going to make the leap from living with my Pentecostal grandparents to living with drag queen roommates. I'm going to star in my own TV show. I'm going to make the leap from outhouses to bathhouses...to my very own house.\\" In October 2007, Crocker opened Fox Reality channel's \\"Reality Remix Really Awards\\". Crocker was one of Lily Allen's Internet correspondents on the February 2008 premiere episode of BBC's Lily Allen and Friends where he posed questions for the guest celebrities, in this case David Mitchell and later, Cuba Gooding, Jr. On May 23, 2008, rock band Weezer released a viral music video for their song \\"Pork and Beans\\" – \\"a natural anthem for the self-expression that's been taking shape on YouTube\\" – which featured various mash-ups of viral videos and YouTube celebrities, including Crocker, all playing themselves.

The EP is a departure of his previous dance style, mainly consisting of ballads and features a duet with his mother. The first single from the EP, \\"Breaking Up\\", was released on January 24, 2013. Crocker announced in August 2011 that a film documenting his life over the past few years would be released, titled Me at the Zoo. The film also explores how video sharing and social media have shaped the way people share their stories and go about their lives. On January 17, 2012, HBO Documentary Films secured the US broadcasting rights to the film. It premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2012 and on HBO on June 25, 2012. =Television show= Prior to the attention from his September 2007 Leave Britney Alone! video, Crocker was seen as a viral video sensation and was asked by MTV vlogger and news staffer Matt Sunbulli to provide video for MTV's website which also broadcasts on MTV itself. Crocker indicated that he hoped to develop his acting career; he agreed to develop ideas for a TV show with Los Angeles producer Glenn Meehan and met with representatives from MTV's gay-themed channel LOGO. According to Variety, Crocker signed a development deal with 44 Blue Productions to create a \\"docusoap\\" reality television show, which would be called Chris Crocker's 15 Minutes More. Rasha Drachkovitch, the production company's co-founder, stated, \\"It's going to pretty much be the Chris Crocker experience. We consider him a rebel character that people will find interesting. He's going to be a TV star.\\" =Pornographic film= In July 2011, it was announced that Crocker had been signed by Chi Chi LaRue to appear in a pornographic film. He made his adult debut in October 2012 for Maverick Men. In 2014, Lucas Entertainment digitally released Chris Crocker's Raw Love, which features Crocker in a scene with his then-boyfriend Justin Dean. Crocker believes that the Leave Britney Alone! video and his performing in porn have hurt his chances of pursuing an acting career. \\"A lot of people think the Britney video is what got me famous and what gave me all these opportunities, but if I were to have gone to L.A. as an unknown actor—I probably could have gotten a lot more work.\\" He said, \\"I don't regret it necessarily; I think it just gives me more hurdles to overcome... Which, you know... and obviously doing the porn thing didn't necessarily help me.\\" Crocker described the porn aspect as having tarnished things, but said that it is up to him \\"to make those little calculated moves\\". \\"It kind of created a whole other box that I have to overcome,\\" he stated. \\"But when you're known as the Britney-boy, or you're in a '15 minutes of fame' box, it's very interesting, because the offers start coming at you really quick. And when they dwindle, you don't know what to do.\\" Crocker stated that acting in porn was going to be more than a single event; \\"it was going to be the porn and then a website, with the same companies.\\" He said he was focused on setting up a future with his then-boyfriend and getting a house and a mortgage. \\"I said, 'Well if I’m going to do it, then let's make it worth it.' So, then we broke up a week before the porn came out. So then, yeah, it kind of ended.\\" He added, \\"You have to contractually, and things, promote a porn. So I regret doing it with my ex more than I regret doing it in general.\\" He says he could do porn again, but wonders how he would extend that into a viable career. \\"[W]here is the reality show? And where are the people that have seen how interesting my life is? Not that many people were, like, the first of their kind to be an Internet celebrity—what happens after that?\\" he said. \\"What happens after you extend your 15 minutes of fame to 30 minutes of fame, and it's six, seven years later, and you’re still living at home in Tennessee? I think that’s an interesting story, a little more than Honey Boo Boo.\\" Appearance, genderbending and gender identity Crocker in 2013 Following his mainstream success, Crocker gradually began to change his image from feminine to masculine, eventually having adopted a predominantly masculine appearance by 2012 and thereby garnering significant attention for being physically attractive. Crocker said that although he understands he is more socially or traditionally attractive, he dislikes people saying it and \\"the most irritating thing\\" is when men he finds attractive say they find him more attractive this way. He felt that people should accept all of him instead of only the masculine side of him, and that dating is difficult because \\"[the guys] can't always accept that [he] used to dress up or that that's a part of [him] still and that [he still dresses up].\\" He identifies with the acceptance he received from his grandmother, who always wanted him to present as masculine, but he also finds it upsetting because she did not accept the way he was before. Crocker said that his gender is not one or the other, but a combination of both, although it is more so a different gender at times, and that it was not a conscious effort for him to become more masculine. \\"I started gradually. I was wearing less makeup and pushing my hair back and putting it in a pony tail instead of curling it or wearing it long.\\" He stated that he \\"never realize[s] the changes that are taking place. They literally just happen\\" and that \\"[his] hair extensions got shorter and shorter and [he] went from 26-inch extensions to shoulder-length extensions.\\" He said that the process is the same with regard to \\"dressing like a girl,\\" adding, \\"It's little by little.\\" With regard to which gender he is more comfortable as, Crocker stated, \\"I definitely feel the most connected with myself I've ever felt. Maybe that's because before I began to explore my more masculine traits, I thought I was going to go through with a boob job.\\" He said he has now \\"explored both sides\\" and feels like he knows himself well. Crocker has expressed discontent with the LGBT community not understanding his genderbending and accompanying gender expression or gender identity: \\"I can understand straight people being confused but within the gay community? The gay on gay hatred or the gay on gay discrimination is what I find so puzzling.\\" He said \\"[w]hen other queer people say, 'If you were really transsexual...' – because I lived as a girl for three years and people ask, 'Was that all an act?' That's the biggest thing that I get disgusted by.\\" Crocker said if it were all an act, he would not have gone through the trouble for three years; for example, using women's bathrooms and therefore encountering problems in airports. He said he thought the whole point of being transgender is being what you feel on the inside. \\"For me, I wonder why do you have to just feel like a woman trapped in a man's body? Or vice versa? Why can't you identify with both genders and tap into those without being accused of dressing up as a girl for attention?\\" Crocker feels that he is \\"fulfilling whatever vibe [he wants] to go with at that time.\\" He \\"[tries] to block out people's voices in [his] head and just go with how [he feels].\\" He acknowledged, however, that his masculine look being \\"easier on [his] family and society\\" factors into presenting as masculine. In a Queerty February 2014 interview, Crocker stated that he is reconsidering whether or not to transition to a female gender identity. \\"I think I'm getting tired of that chameleon lifestyle,\\" he stated. \\"Like I said, I know I would be 100 percent happy living as a girl. But it's a lot of work, and it's a lot of therapy you have to go through. And I'm willing to put in that work.\\" He added, \\"Some people get a haircut. I change genders or gender aesthetics. I don't know that I'll ever be content just one way or another.\\" Crocker said that he is on a journey when assessing that part of his life, and that he would not mind completely transitioning for himself. He said that while living as an everyday guy, he wanted to see if he liked the experience, but that he was unhappy living that way and it did not work because that is not who he is.

The name of FED comes from the initial of Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky. Major features The FED 2 is a new design that is quite different from the FED 1. It has a longer rangefinder base (67 mm), a combined viewfinder and rangefinder window, adjustable diopter for the viewing window, a self timer, and a detachable back for film loading. Variations There are six models. * FED 2a was introduced in 1955. * FED 2b has flash sync added. The new shutter speed dial has the reference point on a center post that rotates with the dial as the shutter is fired. * FED 2c has the flash sync port moved to the top deck from the body. It also has a mushroom-shaped film advance knob. * FED 2d has a new set of shutter speeds, from 1/30 to 1/500, instead of the older set of 1/25 to 1/500. * FED 2L is the only factory-designated model number; all other models are stamped FED 2 by the factory. The body is identical to the FED 2d body but the lens supplied is an Industar-61 with Lanthane glass instead of the Industar-26 used in models 2b to 2d. * FED 2e is a FED 3b with the FED 2d shutter that does not have the slow speeds. Similar to the 3b, it does not have strap lugs but has a film-advance lever. Production ended around 1970. Operation To load a film, two locks in the base of the camera need to be turned. The entire back and bottom can then be removed as a single unit, allowing easy access to the film chamber. Standard 35 mm film cassettes are used, with film being wound onto a removable take-up spool (the latter often becomes difficult to remove on older cameras). Winding the film cocks the shutter and forwards the frame counter simultaneously. The FED 2 has a manual frame counter located below the wind-on knob, which must be reset by hand when loading film. Shutter The Fed 2 has a curtain shutter with speeds from B, 1/25-1/500s. After detaching the back, two screws on under the camera allow you to adjust the spring tension and change the shutter speeds, which may have become slow over time. As with similar cameras, it is important to cock the shutter before operating the shutter speed dial. Failing to do so may harm the mechanism. When firing, this dial will rotate. After re-cocking, the speed set will be indicated correctly again. Lens The FED takes 39 mm screw lenses. The one shown here is a 50mm Jupiter-8 lens. Many FEDs come with Industar lenses. On this lens, the aperture is set on the front and focusing is done with a focusing ring. The rangefinder is coupled to the lens. The field of view in the viewfinder is that of a 5 cm lens. For other focal lengths, a separate turret viewfinder was placed on the accessory shoe.

Biography Beginning as a young karate champion, he engaged in a multi-decade journey leading him throughout Asia and the Eastern energetic traditions. Choosing to forgo an ivy league education in favor of pursuing Japanese martial arts at their original source, he moved to Japan to attend Sophia University at the age of eighteen. There, he obtained multiple black belts and trained with Aikido’s founder Morihei Ueshiba. He soon branched out to Taiwan and China and studied in increasing depth under internal martial arts masters. In 1973, attempting to locate the original source of meditation, Bruce traveled to India where he underwent rigorous daily training in Pranayama, Hatha yoga, Raja yoga and Tantra with many Gurus, experiencing what in the east is known as “Kundalini Shakti”. Returning to China in the mid 1970s, he became the first Westerner to be given insider access to the closely guarded Taoist Fire tradition (unverified tradition) and its priesthood. After completing seven years of training he became priest in the Fire tradition. Then by a fortunate set of events Bruce was accepted as the direct disciple of one of the few remaining stewards of the Water tradition (unverified tradition), the Taoist Immortal (Fully Realized Person) Liu Hung-Chieh. Through Liu Hung-Chieh he was introduced to Jiang Jia Hua the Vice President of the All-China Scientific Qigong Association. This connection gave Bruce access to Chinese cancer clinics where he completed his training as Medical Qigong doctor. Bruce inherited the Taoist Water tradition lineages shortly before Liu-Hung Chieh’s passing in 1986. On his teacher’s wishes he has spent the last 25 years imparting the healing, meditative and martial aspects of Taoism to the West. He primarily teaches the Energy Arts Qigong System, Wu- style t'ai chi, Bagua, Taoist Yoga and Taoist Meditation. He has authored numerous works (including The Power of the Internal Martial Arts and Chi, Tao of Letting Go, Dragon and Tiger Medical Qigong, and Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body) on Taoist energetic practices and taught over 20,000 students many of whom have gone on to become active certified instructors.

He is an active student of Dzogchen, an advanced tradition he considers to share a common origin with the Taoist water tradition. Currently Bruce’s teaching focus has shifted towards healing and meditation in accordance with his late teacher’s final wishes.

Krithia was named after the grain \\"krithos\\", which in Greek means \\"barley\\"; a nearby cape was also called Krithea (Κριθέα) in Byzantine times, now Akbaş Burnu. In the Book of Navigation of the Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (1521), it is recorded as Kirte. At the turn of the 20th century, about 450 Greek families lived in the village. In October 1914, a military mission arrived at the village. Turkish soldiers with fixed bayonets surrounded the village and forced the evacuation of each house in turn. Then, under the eyes of their officers, they seized everything they could lay their hands on. Stripped of everything they possessed, the inhabitants in despair had to seek refuge in Madytos. During the Gallipoli campaign, the village was an objective of the first day of the landing, 25 April 1915. It was never reached. Over the following months, Turkish defenders successfully repulsed several assaults by the invading British and French troops. More famously, the village was the site of the Battle of Krithia during the same campaign. As a result, the settlement suffered extensive damage due to shelling: the two Greek churches were destroyed, and only few traces of its medieval and ancient past remain, such as a column in the village square or architectural elements reused as spolia. Following the departure of the Greek population in the Greco-Turkish population exchange, the village was resettled with Turks from Romania in 1938.

The existence of the submarine was first revealed in 2007, when details about the boat were accidentally published on the Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region's local government website as part of an account of a meeting with its commander. It serves in the Russian Navy's Northern Fleet and is being used as a technology demonstrator for testing of upgraded weapons and military equipment or as an intelligence collection boat. History Sarov was designed by the Rubin Design Bureau during the 1980s and its construction began in 1989 at the Krasnoye Sormovo Shipyard, Nizhniy Novgorod. In 1998, work on the submarine was stopped due to the funding problems that came up with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, after revision of the project, work reportedly continued at the Sevmash Shipyard, Severodvinsk since 2003. Sarov was launched in 2007 and commissioned into service with the Russian Navy in 2008. It is named after the city of Sarov. Design Based on the Kilo-class submarine, it is a unique platform due to the combination of its diesel electric power system and a small nuclear reactor. It is believed the reactor does not drive the propeller itself, but rather produces electricity to recharge the conventional battery system, greatly extending the underwater endurance of the submarine. It has been noted that since electric propulsion is inherently very quiet, but tends to lack range, possession of a long range electrical system would make Sarov an excellent intelligence gathering platform. The Russian Defence Ministry has not revealed whether the boat is employed in this role. Sarov has a crew of 52 and can stay submerged for up to 20 days. It has a maximum speed of on surface, while when submerged and can operate up to depth. Due to the addition of a nuclear reactor section behind the submarine's sail and an escape capsule in the sail, Sarov is significantly longer (98 m) compared to the length of the original Kilo-class submarines (72 m). Operational history On 27 November 2016, Sarov was allegedly involved in a testing of the Russia's nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed Poseidon unmanned underwater vehicle, according to the Pentagon officials. On 20 February 2019, Russian Defence Ministry released a video showing the Poseidon unmanned underwater vehicle as it is being launched out of a torpedo compartment aboard Sarov.

His results were published in the annals of the national and international congresses of angiology. Venous translucence is the process of reflective image visualization of veins by light, which reaches up to the superficial venous system. It is a non-invasive method. Since it is a simple, low-cost technique it can be repeated as needed, which is useful in disease- process monitoring. It is a new diagnostic procedure, still undergoing investigation; more analysis is necessary to hone its technical aspects. Venous translucence is based on optical physics. It is caused by the refraction, absorption and reflection of light (whose principle is the dispersion and absorption of light). The color which is not absorbed is reflected, and is the one that is seen. Therefore, venous translumination is based on the incidence of luminosity on the vein, where part of the light is absorbed and another reflected (supplying a silhouette of the vein in question). Technical aspects Steps must be taken to avoid artifacts or luminous pollution during the venous translumination. Reflection and refraction of light are important to avoid distorted images which can appear during a scanning. Many are due to inappropriate sources which would provoke light loss similar to luminous pollution. During the venous translumination, the amount of reflected light depends on the index of refraction which can be altered by the venous thrombosis. Certain types of lamps process more dispersion than reflection, and therefore favor the formation of artifacts. Another aspect is the inability to be obtain useful images with a fiber-optic source due to the high irradiation frequency. It is also known that the reflection in an optic fiber source is initially processed internally. Certain instruments are not specific to obtain reflected images. The illumination of the skin by distant infrared light, without the impression of the source on the skin, does not reveal a diagnostic image. The translumination transductor must be in direct contact with the skin. The process should be similar to that used in Doppler ultrasonography. Other considerations =Tissue= Tissue transluminated by white light has a refraction index in agreement with its texture. By the impression of the camera on the skin, red and yellow colors are observed. The red color is soon dispersed in the skin and the yellow surrounding it begins to alter its tonality with the change in source direction. A shade with the change of source direction arises. It is known that the refraction index changes in agreement with the spectrum of transmitted light; when the white light is projected and finds an obstacle, it becomes separated into the three elementary colors (red, blue and green). Light during translumination may have greater dispersion or reflection, depending on how the source is placed on the examined area. This handling may improve or degrade the image, depending on the examiner's experience. =Light interaction with skin color= Skin is opaque to light. In physics light reception, heat or other type of radiant energy on the part of molecules is called absorption. When tissues are illuminated during translumination, some light is absorbed and some reflected. It is known that an object which absorbs all radiation is seen as black; the pigments that give color to the skin and the other tissues, absorb certain wavelengths of white light and transmit radiant energy. This is an aspect of color as captured by our vision. The mechanism by which certain substances absorb more light than others apparently depends on their molecular structure. Light, when reaching more pigmented areas, disperses and reflects more easily; the refraction index is smaller, and it is difficult for white light to penetrate below the skin. Studies of the distribution of elastin and collagen fibers in patients with dermal lesions need to be analyzed for changes. A study of tissue consistency using translumination and dermatoscopy could supply important data complementing the diagnosis of some collagen diseases and study tissue aging. Skin color affects the effectiveness of translumination; individuals with light skin have better venous visualization during the translumination than those with darker skin. =Blood viscosity and flow= The erythrocytes absorb more light because they are oxygenated. Considering that aspect, we can deduce that venous blood has a light absorption different from arterial blood (in which sanguine viscosity is greater, due to the higher concentration of CO2. In that sense, venous blood has a greater ability to reflect light. When an arterial-venous fistulae is transluminated, there are few reflected images because flow velocity is higher and sanguine viscosity lower than in the venous segment. It is impossible to visualize arteries by translumination, because they do not provide a reflection due to their accelerated flow. Another aspect is that iron, which composes hemosiderin, emits light of several wavelengths when stimulated. =Histogram= In translumination, the spectrum of white light is divided into different wavelengths (colors). A histogram represents the graphic visualization of these colors and the luminescence of the obtained images. In a histogram, the intensity of the luminescence is accompanied by a gray baseline that decreases as the source approaches, where the red scale is more intense and is represented by a line in ascension. The scales of blue and green colors represent the refraction indexes of the light emitted by the transluminator in contact with the studied area. In the histogram when the selection of a scale (for example, the green scale) is disabled, the luminescence intensity of captured images may be mapped. Bollinger et al. reported their experience: denominated fluorescence videomiscroscopy, based on the video capture of images and study of their luminescence through light emission stimulated by 20% sodium-fluorocein (0.3 ml/l of blood).Bollinger, A; Haselbach, P; Schnewlin, G; Jiinger M (1985) \\"Microangiopathy due to Chronic Venous Incompetence Evaluated by Fluorescence Videomicroscopy\\". Phlebology, 255: 751- 3. The principles of spectrographic analysis of this test are similar to those used to evaluate the luminescence of captured images by venous translumination, and the histogram also evaluates the scales of red, blue and green (RGB). All organic components are composed of chemical elements that emit light according to their wavelength. This is why the histogram analysis of transluminated images could define an organic element according to the quality and amount of their components.

Great Barford Castle was a Motte and bailey castle, made of timber, and surrounded by a moat. It was so named due to its location, just north of the parish of Great Barford. It is located 1 mile south of Renhold Castle, leading to it sometimes being referred to as the \\"Second Renhold\\". The castle is also located near two other castles; Bedford Castle, which is 5 miles away, and Gannock Castle, which is 6 miles east of it. Early history Originally thought to have been built just after the Norman Invasion (1066), when William the Conqueror commanded the building of so many castles in defense of his new position as King of England, it is now known to have been built after the Domesday Book (1086) was commissioned. By 1250, the castle was standing, and was in the possession of James de Crevequeor (d. 1263), the family from which it derived its later name of \\"Creakers Manor\\". James' eldest son Robert died in the same year as his father and it is unknown if he ever held the castle. In 1302/1303 the castle was in the possession of James' youngest son James de Crevequeor. By 1416, it had passed to Stephen de Crevequeor, grandson of the first mentioned James, and his wife Anne, who were still holding it in 1530. Their son John de Crevequeor (d. 1370) was holding it as of 1346, and upon his death without issue, his nephew Stephen de Crevequeor (d. 1370), son of John's brother Geoffrey, inherited the property. Stephen died shortly after inheriting the estate, while still underage, and the property passed to Stephen's younger brother, John Crevequer, on the attainment of his majority in 1385. This is when the castle was first referred to, in historical documents, as \\"Creaker's Manor\\", and was hencefore known as such. The manor was held, in 1428, by Stephen Crevequer, a son or grandson of the afore mentioned John Crevequeor. Stephen Crevequer is listed as one of the Bedfordshire gentry in 1433, but there in no mention of the manor. Later history The manor is not mentioned again until 1511, when William FitzJeffrey of Thurleigh died and the manor is listed in his possession passing to his son John FitzJeffrey, son of his first wife. John FitzJeffrey died in 1535, and his widow Joan retained the property until her death a year later, when it passed to John's half-brother George FitzJeffrey, who had been first married to the daughter of John Baptist. On George's death in 1575, the manor was left to his second wife, Judith Throckmorton, of the famous Throckmorton family of that period. She married John Rolt of Milton Ernest. Judith and John transferred the manor, in 1589, to George's son George FitzJeffrey, who was knighted in 1606. George died in 1618 without heir, his son having predeceased him in 1616, and was buried on the property in December of that same year. The property was sold and later held by the Chandler, Mander, Peck, and Halsey families, until being sold in 1770 to the Pedley family. It is believed that the manor mentioned in 1511 is not the original pre-12th century structure, the original having been destroyed, or having fallen into ruin, and the remains reincorporated into the manor mentioned.

The plan has been promoted since 1999 by the National Association of Secretaries of State. Map of the Rotating Regional Plan. Red is East, Yellow is Midwest, Green is South, and Blue is the West region. The plan provides that the individual state primaries (or caucuses) would be grouped into 4 regions, each region voting in a different month--either March, April, May or June. Individual states in a region would vote on or soon after the first Tuesday of their month, though not necessarily on the same day. The first year, the order would be determined by lottery, and subsequently rotate for each election. To continue traditional early primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, they would be permitted to hold their primaries or caucus before any of the regions. Regional Groupings: *East: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. *South: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. *Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. *West: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming and Guam. Criticism Both the Republican and Democratic parties have been lukewarm to the concept. In 2000, the Republican National Committee's Advisory Commission on the Presidential Nominating Process passed over the Rotating Regional plan in favor of the Delaware Plan. In 2005, the Democratic National Committee's Commission on Presidential Nomination Timing and Scheduling ranked it ninth on a list of ten priorities, just above keeping the status quo. =Large initial primary size= The size of the initial regional primary may be large enough to prevent less-funded candidates from being able to compete. Options Map of same-sized politically balanced regions. All 4 regions voted between 48% and 53% (and between 48% and 59% of electoral votes) for the GOP in the most recent election. Note loss of contiguity in the red and green regions. =Lottery system= Larry Sabato, Director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, proposed a lottery system in his book, A More Perfect Constitution. This would use the same regions as above, but would wait until about 6 months before the first primary before selecting the order of the primaries. This would prevent candidates from \\"camping out\\" in early primary states. This can also be adjusted to prevent a region from being picked twice in a row, or to prevent any region that went first the last two times from going first. =Politically balanced regions= One criticism of the regional system is that the East is a very liberal region, while the South is very conservative. Given the stability of the voting patterns over the last several elections, regions might be balanced politically, at the possible cost of some contiguity. For example, instead of including Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey in with New York and New England, a balanced region might bounce over to Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky instead. There would be a loss of regional identity, and non-contiguous regions, but there would be a gain of political balance. =Combination of final two regions= In a given election, after the first and second regions have held primaries, the remaining two regions can be combined to hold a final primary. This would shorten the primary schedule, and leave no fourth primary likely scheduled after the nominees have been selected.

Headed by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, the brotherhood also administers the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, such as metropolitans, archbishops, bishops, archimandrites, hieromonks, hierodeacons, and monks. According to its own tradition, the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre was founded in 313 as the Order of the Spoudaeoi (\\"studious\\", \\"zealous\\", \\"industrious\\"), or the \\"Spoudaeoi of the Holy Resurrection of Christ\\". The traditional date of foundation corresponds to the Edict of Milan and its legalisation of Christianity in the Roman Empire, as well as the foundation of the churches in the Holy Land by Emperor Constantine and his mother, Empress Helena, which is in turn traditionally dated to 326. According to findings of contemporary researchers, they were present before 326, organised as an order of ordained clergy during the visit of Saint Helen in Jerusalem. Saint Cyril of Jerusalem makes mention of them. They were distinguished for their asceticism in uninterrupted prayer and supplication. Name A sepulchre is a burial chamber and in this case Holy Sepulchre refers to the burial chamber of Jesus, what is believed to be his tomb inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. History The history of the Brotherhood is closely linked with the history of the Jerusalem Church, which began in the Apostolic Age. =Late Roman and Byzantine periods (327-638)= Following Constantine's Peace of the Church in 313, the Church of the Resurrection, today better known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, was founded under the patronage of Constantine and his mother, Helena, at the time and through the work of Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem. At about the same time, St Hilarion introduced monasticism in Palestine, erected the first monastery, ordered and regulated monastic life, and formed the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre. Besides devotional duties, the purpose of the Brotherhood is the support and protection of all of the Holy places in Palestine, including the Holy Sepulchre, Golgotha. The Fourth Ecumenical Council (451) elevated the Bishop of Jerusalem to the rank of Patriarch because of the special significance acquired between the First and Fourth Ecumenical Councils. This included elements such as the erection of magnificent churches; the conversion of much of Palestine to Christianity; attraction of pilgrims from around the world; the importance of outstanding bishops, monks, and teachers of the Church of Jerusalem; the struggles of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre on behalf of Orthodoxy; and the support of various Roman and Byzantine emperors. The Brotherhood had to struggle to preserve the holy places began during this period. The Persians occupied Jerusalem in 614 and took Patriarch Zacharias prisoner, along with the palladium of Christianity, the Precious Cross. Chrysostomos Papadopoulos writes in his history of the Patriarchate: \\"The Churches and the monasteries, inside and outside Jerusalem, were destroyed; the Christians were brutally slaughtered … thousands of prisoners purchased by Jews were slaughtered. Anything good that existed was destroyed or was plundered by the invaders. The monks were slaughtered mercilessly, especially those of St Savvas Monastery.\\" Between 617-626, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt by Patriarch Modestus. In 637, after a long siege of Jerusalem, Patriarch Sophronius surrendered Jerusalem to Caliph Umar. In the Covenant of Umar I, the Patriarch managed to save the shrines from destruction and, at the same time, to secure the ownership of the holy places as well as the privileges of the Brotherhood. =Early Muslim period (638-1099)= During this period, the Church of Jerusalem and the Brotherhood suffered many persecutions and trials. The shrines were repeatedly ransacked and defaced by the successors of Umar, and there was great persecution all around. The most deadly persecution occurred during the time of the Fatamid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, named the \\"Nero of Egypt\\" for his merciless acts, which started in 1007. He persecuted ferociously both Christians and Jews. He ordered that in public Jews were to wear masks representing the head of an ox and bells around their necks; Christians were to wear mourning apparel and crosses one yard in length. Also, Al-Hakim ordered the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. His son, the Caliph Ali az-Zahir, under a treaty with Constantinople, permitted the reconstruction of the shrines. =Crusader/Ayyubid period (1099-1260)= During the Crusades, persecution of the Brotherhood continued. Being expelled by the Latin (Roman Catholic) clergy from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other holy places, the Brotherhood regrouped in the metochion of the Lavra of St Savvas and eventually regained possession of the holy places after 1187. =Mamluk period (1260-1517)= With the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, Patriarch Athanasios went to Constantinople and there received from Mehmed II the document that confirmed the ownership of the holy places by the Brotherhood. =Ottoman period (1517 to World War I)= The Brotherhood continued to struggle against the Latins and the Armenians whom the Brotherhood regarded as encroaching on their traditional rights and authority over the holy places, both of which they claimed had been confirmed by Byzantine and then Muslim authorities. During this period the Brotherhood undertook the following construction works: # repairing the canopy of the Holy Sepulchre in 1545 by Patriarch Germanos; # rebuilding the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1808 after it was burnt by the Armenians; # rebuilding the small dome over the Holy Sepulchre in 1927; # rebuilding the ædicule surrounding the Holy Sepulchre in 1931-1933; and, # repairing and refurbishing the Church of the Nativity of Christ in Bethlehem in 1842. Organisation The Brotherhood was reconstituted during the period of the British Mandate in Palestine before and after World War I, and continues its defence of the religious status quo, especially in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Headed by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem as hegumen, styled \\"Our Father and Lord, the Most Holy Beatitude, Patriarch of the Holy City of Jerusalem and of all Palestine\\", the Brotherhood also administers the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. Jordanian Law No. 227, dated 16 January 1958, regulates the Brotherhood's government. Holy places =Sites and shrines= The Holy Places that the Brotherhood has preserved over the centuries include: Jerusalem and surroundings * The Church of the Holy Sepulchre with ** The Tomb of Jesus (the Holy Sepulchre) ** The Dreadful Golgotha ** The site where St Helen discovered the True Cross * The Tomb of the Mother of God in Gethsemane * The Pool of Siloam * On the Mount of Olives: ** The site of Christ's Ascension ** The Tomb of Lazarus in Bethany * Bethesda Bethlehem * The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem Jordan River * The site of Christ's baptism in the River Jordan (Al-Maghtas & Qasr el Yahud) Galilee and the Sea of Galilee * Mount Tabor * Nazareth, the city of the Annunciation (the Church of St Gabriel) * The Sea of Galilee (also known as the Lake of Gennesaret and the Sea of Tiberias) ** Capernaum, the \\"Town of Jesus\\" * Cana Samaria * Jacob's Well in Nablus. =Status quo= The immovable ladder. Detail from photograph of main entrance above, 2011 After the renovation of 1555, control of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favorable firman from the Sublime Porte at a particular time, often through outright bribery, and violent clashes were not uncommon. In 1757, weary of the squabbling, the Porte issued a firman that divided the church among the claimants. This was confirmed in 1852 with another firman that made the arrangement permanent, establishing a status quo of territorial division among the communities. Greek Orthodox priest of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem The primary custodians are the Greek Orthodox Church, which has the lion's share, the Custodian of the Holy Land, an official of the Franciscans and affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic Churches. In the 19th century, the Coptic Orthodox, the Ethiopian Orthodox and the Syriac Orthodox acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures within and around the building. Times and places of worship for each community are strictly regulated in common areas. Under the status quo, no part of what is designated as common territory may be so much as rearranged without consent from all communities. This often leads to the neglect of badly needed repairs when the communities cannot come to an agreement among themselves about the final shape of a project. Just such a disagreement has delayed the renovation of the edicule, where the need is now dire, but also where any change in the structure might result in a change to the status quo disagreeable to one or more of the communities. A less grave sign of this state of affairs is located on a window ledge over the church's entrance. Someone placed a wooden ladder there sometime before 1852, when the status quo defined both the doors and the window ledges as common ground. The ladder remains there to this day, in almost exactly the same position. It can be seen to occupy the ledge in century-old photographs and engravings. None of the communities controls the main entrance. In 1192, Saladin assigned responsibility for it to a Muslim family. The Joudeh Al-Goudia a noble family with a long history were entrusted with the keys as custodians. This arrangement has persisted into modern times. Breaches of the status quo The establishment of the status quo did not halt the violence, which continues to break out every so often even in modern times. For example, on a hot summer day in 2002, a Coptic monk who is stationed on the roof to express Coptic claims to the Ethiopian territory there moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians, leading to a fracas, with eleven people being hospitalized.Christian History Corner: Divvying up the Most Sacred Place  Christianity Today  A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction In another incident in 2004 during Orthodox celebrations of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out. Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured. On Palm Sunday, in April 2008, a brawl broke out due to a Greek monk being ejected from the building by a rival faction. Police were called to the scene but were also attacked by the enraged brawlers.Armenian, Greek worshippers come to blows at Jesus' tomb - Haaretz - Israel News A clash erupted between Armenian and Greek monks on Sunday 9 November 2008, during celebrations for the Feast of the Holy Cross.

TSOS was originally designed in 1968 for the Spectra 70/46, a modified version of the 70/45. TSOS quickly evolved into the Virtual Memory Operating System (VMOS) by 1970. VMOS continued to be supported on the later RCA 3 and RCA 7 computer systems. RCA was in the computer business until 1971 when it sold its computer business to Sperry Corporation. Sperry renamed TSOS to VS/9 and continued to market it into the early 1980s. In the mid seventies, an enhanced version of TSOS called BS2000 was offered by the German company Siemens. While Sperry - now Unisys - discontinued VS/9, the BS2000 variant, now called BS2000/OSD, is still offered by Fujitsu and used by their mainframe customers primarily in Germany and other European countries.

History Paronella Park from the top of Mena Creek Falls Innisfail c 1935 Paronella Park was built in the 1930s by José Paronella (ca.1888 – 23 August 1948), a Spanish immigrant. Paronella arrived in nearby Innisfail, Queensland, Australia in 1913, having sailed from his homeland, Catalonia, in northern Spain to plan a life for himself and his fiancée Matilda. He applied for Commonwealth naturalization in 1921, identifying his place of origin as La Vall in the province of Girona. In fact his full name was José Pedro Enrique Paronella, and he was born on 26 February 1887, in La Vall de Santa Creu, a hamlet in the province of Gerona, north- eastern Catalonia. Paronella worked hard for 11 years, creating his wealth by buying, improving, and selling cane farms. While travelling through the beautiful countryside he discovered a virgin forest alongside spectacular Mena Creek Falls - the perfect location for his dream. Upon returning to Spain, Paronella discovered that Matilda had married another man. Determined to sail back with a bride, José proposed to Margarita, Matilda's younger sister. One year later, the newlyweds were ship-bound for Australia and by 1929 had purchased the land of José's dreams. He first built the grand 47-step staircase to shift building materials between the lower and upper level. Here, the couple had their cottage hand built of stone, and moved in on Christmas Eve. Inspired by childhood memories of Catalan castles, Paronella and his workers set to work designing an entertainment area. Their fingerprints in the cement foundations remain as testament to their extraordinary effort. A movie theatre transformed on weekends into a huge ballroom with live bands who entertained while a massive ball of mirrors spun from the ceiling to reflect a dazzle of pink and blue lights. More than 7000 trees were planted around the Paronellas' home and castle, including an avenue of Kauris that tower now like cathedral spires in a sacred forest. North Queensland's first hydro electric plant was built in 1933 to power the park, and the castle grounds were ready to welcome the public in 1935. The Paronellas invited everyone to movies on Saturday nights, built tennis courts from crushed termite mounds, and a pavilion with turret-topped balconies, refreshment rooms and changing cubicles for swimmers. Eventually a museum featured a collection of coins, pistols, dolls, timbers and interesting keepsakes. The Kiosk Paronella Park Innisfail c 1935 Unexpectedly, the tale of Paronella Park took swift and dangerous turns starting in 1946 when a mass of logs from a clearing upstream swept away a railway bridge and descended on the park, destroying the refreshment rooms. Undaunted, the Paronellas replanted gardens, repaired what they could, and re- opened for business 6 months later. Paronella died in 1948, leaving Margarita, daughter Teresa, and son Joe. Teresa married Pino Zerlotti and Joe married Val Ribes. In 1967 Margarita died leaving Joe and Val as custodians of José's dream. After Joe's death in 1972, Val and their two sons Joe and Kerry, continued until the park was sold in 1977. In 1979 a fire swept through the castle, leaving only the walls and the turret as a reminder of what had been. In 1986, Cyclone Winifred tested the park's endurance once again. The park changed owners several times until, in 1993, it was bought by the present owners. Mark and Judy Evans, the park's current owners rediscovered the almost lost park and envisaged reviving Paronella's dream with his appreciation for beauty and warm hospitality. With the help of the Paronella family, Paronella's story was written [\\"The Spanish Dreamer\\" by Dena Leighton, available in the Paronella Park Gift Shop]. Paths were uncovered, buildings repaired, trees identified, and a museum created in the original home built by Paronella for his family. Cyclone Larry in 2006 added another chapter of endurance to the story, and the dream continued once again. Paronella Park is eco-certified and heritage listed. Efforts today focus on maintaining the property while staying true to its historic and ecological values. A number of ongoing restoration and preservation projects will see the Paronella Park story live on for many years to come.  The Impossible Dream  On 24 July 2010, a theater production, The Impossible Dream was launched at Shangri-La Hotel, The Marina, Cairns. The Impossible Dream is based on the true story of José and his bride Margarita.  Hydroelectric plant  In 1933, Paronella installed a hydro-electric plant, the first (privately owned) in Queensland, on the waterfall in the park. He used it to supply power for the park's lighting, pumps, refrigeration and cinema. The town of Mena Creek also used some of the electricity. The plant was eventually decommissioned. In 2009 the park completed a restoration of the plant, and now runs entirely off hydro- electric power. Some of the excess electricity is fed back into the local grid.Paronella Park: The Hydro ProjectNews - park now running off hydro electricity Hydro Plant from swing bridge over Mena Creek Falls  Activities  Today, visitors are taken on a range of guided tours. Paronella's story is told and the highlights of the park shown through the day and into the night. The Dream Continues tour - a 45-minute guided walk, departing every half-hour from 9:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m., highlighting features of the park and telling the story of José Paronella’s ideas for the site. The Darkness Falls tour - a one-hour night tour of the site at 6:20 p.m., with an additional tour at 8:30 p.m. during peak season. Self-guided Botanical Walk - a self-guided tour, with the aid of a 16-page booklet containing details of the park's flora, with various tree species identified throughout the park. Awards and recognitions In 2004, Paronella Park was named Queensland's premier significant attraction by the Queensland Tourism. It was also a joint winner in the \\"Emerging Business\\" category of the Reconciliation Awards for Business (2004), awarded by the Queensland Government. Paronella Park, in the middle of the Canecutter Way, was voted the Number One \\"Must Do\\" in the RACQ 150 Must Do competition in 2009. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Paronella Park was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"location\\".

Its members, nicknamed the Bulkies, had authority within the Belfast Police District. History A town watch was authorised under several acts of the Parliament of Ireland, the last (the Belfast Police Act) in 1800, which also established town commissioners for lighting and paving. The police and commissioners gained greater powers in 1816 under a local act of the UK Parliament. The police area of jurisdiction, whose residents were liable for the police tax to fund the force, was not defined in the 1816 act; at first the police area was taken to be the same as the lighting and paving area, but later it was extended. The parliamentary borough and municipal borough had differing limits again.Comm Mun Corp 1835, p,697 §§1,5 By the time the force was abolished, its jurisdiction remained confined to County Antrim, excluding Ballymacarrett, the County Down portion of the borough of Belfast.Belfast Commission Report 1869, p.4 It then had 160 men. The RIC had 70 men stationed in Belfast at the beginning of the August 1864 riots, with 800 reinforcements arriving over the next two weeks.Belfast Commission Report 1869, p.362, Table C. By the 1800 act, the police commissioners were the thirteen members of the municipal corporation together with twelve town commissioners for lighting and paving. Although the borough sovereign was authorised to act as police magistrate, in 1816 he appointed a substitute at a salary of £200 per annum, which the 1835 municipal corporation commission considered one of several abuses concerning the police.Comm Mun Corp 1835 pp.702–705 §§36–41 After the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 reformed the corporation, the Belfast Improvement Act 1845 replaced the 1800 and 1816 acts. Most of the Belfast Borough Police force were Protestants, and many local Roman Catholics regarded it as sectarian. An 1864 commission of inquiry examined the Belfast magistrate and police district, after serious communal rioting that year. The commission noted that most of the senior members of the force were members of the Orange Order and recommended abolishing the force, which was effected by the Constabulary (Ireland) Amendment Act 1865.

Population: History It was founded in 1911 as a result of an unsuccessful attempt of paving the road to Yakutsk. The project was frozen because of the outbreak of World War I, which is how the village got its name (literally meaning cul-de- sac). During the war, many POWs were sent here. In April 1919, a partisan group of internationalists, mainly Hungarians, was exterminated by the Japanese expeditionary corps and ataman Grigory Semyonov's troops (the Jewish regiment). In 1938, Tupik was chosen to be the administrative center of Tungiro-Olyokminsky District. Russians, Ukrainians, and Evenks are three main ethnic groups in Tupik.

The National Storytelling Festival was founded by Jimmy Neil Smith, a high school journalism teacher in 1973. It has grown over the years to become a major festival both in the United States and internationally. History In 1973, Jimmy Neil Smith, a high school journalism teacher, and a carload of students heard Grand Ole Opry regular Jerry Clower spin a tale over the radio about coon hunting in Mississippi. Smith was inspired by that event to create a story telling festival in Northeast Tennessee. In October 1973, the first National Storytelling Festival was held in Jonesborough, Tennessee. Hay bales and wagons were the stages, and audience and tellers together didn't number more than 60. Two years after the first festival, Smith founded the National Association for the Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling (NAPPS), an organization that led America's storytelling renaissance. In 1994, the name of the organization was shortened to the National Storytelling Association (NSA). Another name change occurred in 1998, when NSA \\"divided into two separate organizations, National Storytelling Network (NSN) and International Storytelling Center (ISC)\\". Today, the ISC promotes the power of storytelling and the creative applications of this ancient tradition to enrich the human experience in the home, at the workplace, and throughout the world. The National Storytelling Network is a membership organization, \\"connecting people to and through storytelling\\". An online festival will be held in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Festival Produced by the International Storytelling Center, the three-day outdoor festival features performances by internationally known artists. In existence for almost 50 years, the Festival attracts nearly 11,000 audience members annually, including school groups whose students attend as an educational experience. The festival builds on the Appalachian cultural tradition of storytelling. Held under circus tents scattered throughout Jonesborough, storytellers sit on stages or at the head of the tent to perform. There are usually five or six tents in close proximity so that festival goers can easily walk from tent to tent and from performance to performance. Past storytellers include Pete Seeger, Carmen Agra Deedy, Jay O'Callahan, Donald Davis, Syd Lieberman, Andy Offutt Irwin, Sheila Kay Adams, and Kathryn Tucker Windham. The festival has expanded to include the growing ranks of Youth Storytellers, including showcasing participants and winners of the National Youth Storytelling Showcase. The festival influenced the development of a storytelling graduate degree program at the nearby East Tennessee State University.

He was born on 9 April 1954 in Meßkirch in the district of Sigmaringen in Baden-Württemberg in Germany.  Life  Stadler grew up on a farm in Rast, a small village adjoining Sauldorf, a neighboring village of his birthplace Meßkirch. Stadler studied catholic theology in Munich and Rome, German philology at Freiburg im Breisgau and Köln, ending with a doctoral degree (Dr. phil.). The first serious and prominent recommendation regarding his works came 1994 of Martin Walser (Der Spiegel No. 31 from 1 August 1994). The partial autobiographically affected works play frequently in his region of origin (Heimat), the landscape between the Danube and the Lake of Constance. The change of this rurally shaped area and its homelessness (Heimatlosigkeit) are recurring topics in his literary works.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2004. The 2004 Craven District Council election took place on 10 June 2004 to elect members of Craven District Council in North Yorkshire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was as follows: *Conservative 13 *Independent 11 *Liberal Democrats 6 Background After the last election in 2003, the Conservatives had 11 seats, compared to 10 for independents and 9 Liberal Democrats. However, in November 2003 an independent candidate gained a seat from the Liberal Democrats at a by-election in Bentham. At the 2004 election two long serving councillors stood down, Beth Graham from Settle and Ribblesbanks ward, who had been a councillor since 1976, and Peter Walbank of Grassington ward. Candidates at the election included the first Labour party candidate for a few years, James Black in Skipton South, while the Green party also stood a candidate in Aire Valley with Lothersdale. Election result The Conservatives gained 2 seats at the election to have 13 councillors, compared to 11 independents and 6 Liberal Democrats. Overall turnout at the election reached 50% after being held with all postal voting, only 9% below the turnout nationally at the 2001 general election, with the high turnout leading to a delay in the counting of the results.

It has a length of about ten miles (16 km). According to historical writer and blogger Leon J. Pollom, the lowest section of Forbes was originally named Diamond Street. Mayor David L.

The buildings that stand along Forbes Avenue are a mixture of old and new. The westernmost terminus of Forbes Avenue lies at Stanwix Street in the downtown part of the city. This runs eastward past the recent PPG Place, directly through Market Square and then between the 19th century Courthouse and the 20th century City- County Building. Duquesne University, though established in the 19th century, mostly abuts Forbes with some early- to mid-20th century buildings. Some mostly late-19th century buildings form Forbes's passage through Midtown and the Uptown. In Oakland, it goes through a mixture of late 19th century stores, and then passes the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning (early 20th century) and the late 19th century Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. From Oakland, Forbes Avenue continues eastward past 20th- and 21st- century Carnegie Mellon University and late 19th century Schenley Park, through the small stores of Squirrel Hill, and past Homewood Cemetery and Frick Park before it reaches its eastern terminus at Wilkinsburg.

Biography Born in Nelson Township, Halton County, Canada West, Henderson was educated at the Milton Grammar School and the Normal School of Toronto, and initially worked as a teacher in Nelson, later becoming a deputy registrar for the County. In 1869, he was elected a town councillor in Milton, Ontario, but not without controversy: he was accused of having switched allegiances on election day (known as there was no secret ballot) and thus had obtained his seat under false pretences. =In business= He later settled in Acton, Ontario, and operated a general store in partnership with David Darling Christie, his brother-in-law. They also owned a quarry with related lime kilns at Kelso in Nassagaweya Township. In 1881, he established the Acton Banking Company, a private bank allied with the Bank of Hamilton, as no other bank then had a branch in the village. The bank remained in existence until 1901, and was considered to be financially sound during that time. When Acton was incorporated as a village in 1874, he served on the village council for fifteen years, including one year as Reeve in 1880. =As an MP= He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the electoral district of Halton in an 1888 by-election after the sitting MP, John Waldie, was unseated for bribery by agents. His election was seen as being significant, in that he won through the support of the rural parts of the riding while voters in Milton and Georgetown swung more towards the Opposition candidate. Henderson was then unseated for corrupt practices by agents, and was later defeated in the resulting by-election. A Conservative, he was elected in the 1891 federal election and re-elected in 1896, 1900, 1904, 1908, and 1911. In recognition of his long service in the House of Commons, he was made a member of the Privy Council of Canada in February 1916.

Born in Australia, Gülüm played for Australia at under-23 level before electing to represent Turkey in senior competition. Early life Gülüm grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Meadow Heights. Career Gülüm in 2010 Gülüm progressed up the ranks after playing exceptional football for Hume City as an 18-year-old. He was originally transferred to Turkish Super League team Manisaspor in 2005, after being spotted by Leading Teams Operations Manager Ezel Hikmet and referred to experienced Turkish coach Ersun Yanal whilst playing for and captaining the Australian School Boys team touring the United Kingdom. Impressed with the raw talent of the young defender, Gülüm was a part of the senior squad for the entire season as a backup defender, but only managed 2 Super League and 2 Turkish Cup matches. Gülüm was transferred to Elazigspor in February 2008 where he managed to play in every match, gaining a reputation as a strong left footed defender. After a solid second half of the season, Gülüm was transferred to Adanaspor for the 2008–09 signing a lucrative three-year deal, where he played 30 League matches and was rewarded for his great form by being selected in the team of the year as the best central defender in the competition.Bank Asya ödülleri verildi On 17 July 2010, despite being heavily linked with Galatasaray, Gülüm transferred to rival Turkish club Beşiktaş with Adanaspor acquiring an option to loan Gülüm back for one season. After he had a productive season with Beşiktaş, they acquired Gülüm's full rights for a fee of €4 million. Gülüm training with Adelaide United in 2017 On 17 July 2017, Gülüm transferred to Adelaide United on a season long loan from Hebei China Fortune Adelaide United announced that Gülüm had returned to Hebei China Fortune after making 22 appearances on loan to the Adelaide club. In November 2018, Gülüm returned to Melbourne, joining Victorian State League Division 1 side Whittlesea United as player-manager. On 7 May 2019, Gülüm signed for new A-League club Western United for the upcoming 2019–20 A-League season. International career Gülüm was born in Australia to Turkish parents, meaning that he was eligible to play for Australia and Turkey from birth as per the FIFA eligibility criteria. =Australia under-23s= Gülüm was involved in Australia's qualifying campaign for the 2008 Summer Olympics, he made his international debut for the Australia national under-23 association football team as an 84th-minute substitute replacing Ruben Zadkovich on 6 June 2007 away to Jordan in Ammam. In November 2010, it was speculated that he would be selected for Australia's friendly against Egypt. After the call-up did not come, Gülüm chose to represent Turkey and said that he often felt overlooked by Football Federation Australia: \\"For me it has been a case of being overlooked at all levels in the past for Australia, for whatever the reason has been.\\" =Turkey= Former Australia head coach Guus Hiddink swooped and added Gülüm to the Turkish squad scheduled to play the Netherlands on 17 November 2010, although he did not make his international debut for the Crescent Stars in that match. The following month, Australia coach Osieck had met with Gülüm while the Australian men's team was touring Europe and stated that Gülüm was \\"very positive\\" about representing Australia. Gülüm was named on the 50-man shortlist for Australia's 2011 AFC Asian Cup campaign, but was not selected in the final 23-man squad. Osieck told the press that Gülüm's father \\"said Ersan should opt for Turkey because he plays in Turkey and makes his living there and they both feel a lot of pressure from the Turkish media and the Besiktas supporters\\". Gülüm was again called up to the Turkish national team in November 2012, this time by Abdullah Avcı. He said he was proud to be a part of the national team. He was left off the team on the roster when the team played Romania on 12 October 2012. He was an unused sub in Turkey's 6 September 2013 match against Andorra. He made his first appearance for Turkey as a 90th-minute substitute on 10 September 2013 in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying game against Romania.

History The 1861 Act was for a locally promoted line supported by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;) and the Great Northern Railway (GNR). Together the MSLR and GNR formed a joint committee to operate this railway along with three others that had been authorised but were not yet open. Together these railways connected up to provide an alternative route into North Cheshire that avoided Manchester. Each company was to provide an equal amount of capital and four representatives to the joint management committee. This arrangement was confirmed by the Great Northern (Cheshire Lines) Act in Parliament in 1863. This Act had not, however, formally set up a separate legal body, providing instead for the two companies to manage and work the four railways through their existing structures. This arrangement eventually led to the formation of the Cheshire Lines Committee in 1865. The line was then formally brought under the direct joint ownership of the MS&LR; and GNR in 1865 by the Cheshire Lines Transfer Act, 1865. The Act allowed the Midland Railway (MR) to join as an equal partner, which it did in 1866. and finally The Cheshire Lines Committee was authorised by The Cheshire Lines Act, 1867 as a fully independent organisation with a board formed from three directors from each of the parent companies. Opening The railway from Stockport opened on 1 December 1865 through to Deansgate Junction. The section from Skelton East Junction to Broadheath Junction opened on 1 February 1866 and the final connection from Skelton North Junction to Timperley Junction opened on 1 February 1879. Eastern terminal Junction at Stockport Route and stations The railway started at an end-on connection to the western terminus of the Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway (S&WJR;) at station. It ran to three places: *to connect with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) at Broadheath Junction, and *to connect with the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJ&AR;) at both Timperley Junction and at Altrincham Deansgate Junction. All three destinations are in the vicinity of Altrincham.Western terminal Junction at Altrincham Initial intermediate stations were at: * renamed later to Stockport Tiviot Dale. *. *, and *. Stockport Tiviot Dale railway station c.1902 Goods facilities were provided at all the stations and in addition there were two goods depots at Stockport, Georges Road and Wellington Road, one each side of the main line. They both opened around 1866, their proximity led to them being considered as one facility, they were treated as the same in the Handbook of Railway Stations. Wellington Road had a 10 ton capacity crane. The Act authorised working arrangements between the railway and its two neighbours, the Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway and the Cheshire Midland Railway, the ST&AJR; was granted running powers over the MSJ&AR; and the LNWR was granted running powers between its two sections of railway at Northenden and Broadheath Junctions. The ST&AJR; served as a very useful avoiding line to the south of Manchester and carried a very heavy freight traffic which funnelled in from several routes from the East Midlands and Yorkshire to south Lancashire and Cheshire. This required hard working of the steam locomotives by their crews to clear the bottleneck stretch of line for the following trains. Closures Stockport Tiviot Dale remained in use until closure on 2 January 1967. The other stations all closed on 30 November 1964, when the Stockport Tiviot Dale to service ceased. Modern times Though passenger services had all ceased by the late 1960s, the line remained in regular use for goods traffic throughout the following decade, mainly carrying coal traffic from South Yorkshire to Fiddlers Ferry power station and limestone aggregates from the Peak District to the Brunner Mond works near Northwich. In 1980 though, the eastern section of the line from Portwood to Cheadle was temporarily closed to traffic for safety reasons after the Lancashire Hill tunnel near Tiviot Dale sustained roof damage during construction work on the nearby M63 motorway and the traffic using it diverted away. The closure of the Woodhead Line the following summer removed the main reason for the line's continuing existence and so in 1982 it was formally abandoned and subsequently lifted. The Skelton Junction to Warrington Arpley line which it fed into at its western end also suffered the same fate in July 1985, with infrastructure issues again the reason behind the closure (the deteriorating condition of the Manchester Ship Canal viaduct at Latchford being the cause this time). This left only the sections from Edgeley Junction to Deansgate Junction and Cheadle Heath to Northenden (which connected to the surviving portion of the 1902 Midland line from New Mills to ) in use. Passenger trains were re-introduced when Manchester's tram network, Metrolink, took over the direct Manchester to Altrincham line (ex-MSJAR) in 1992. Trains from Manchester to points beyond Altrincham now travel via Stockport over this line which today forms part of the Mid-Cheshire Line. The intermediate stations have not been re-opened, though there have been proposals put forward to reopen Baguley station to act as an interchange with the nearby Baguley Metrolink station on the recently Metrolink line from St Werburgh's Road to .

This is considered a sign of fear in the marketplace, as investors seek less risk in exchange for lower profits. Flight-to-quality is usually accompanied by an increase in demand for assets that are government-backed and a decline in demand for assets backed by private agents. Definition More broadly, flight-to-quality refers to a sudden shift in investment behaviors in a period of financial turmoil whereby investors seek to sell assets perceived as risky and instead purchase safe assets. A defining feature of flight-to-quality is insufficient risk-taking by investors. While excessive risk-taking can be a source of financial turmoil, insufficient risk-taking can severely disrupt credit and other financial markets during a financial turmoil. Such a portfolio shift further exposes the financial sector to negative shocks. An increase in leverage and credit spread on all but the safest and most liquid assets may incur a sudden dry up in risky asset markets, which may lead to real effects on the economy. A phenomenon that occurs with flight-to-quality is flight-to-liquidity. A flight-to-liquidity refers to an abrupt shift in large capital flows towards more liquid assets. One reason why the two appear together is that in most cases risky assets are also less liquid. Assets that are subject to the flight to quality pattern are also subject to flight to liquidity. For example, a U.S. Treasury bond is less risky and more liquid than a corporate bond. Thus, most theoretical studies that attempt to explain underlying mechanisms take both flight-to-quality and flight-to-liquidity into account. Mechanism Flight-to-quality episodes are triggered by unusual and unexpected events.Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \\"Collective risk management in a Flight to quality episode.\\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230. These events are rare but the list is longer than a few. The Penn Central Railroad’s default in 1970, a sudden stock market crash referred to as Black Monday, the Russian debt default and collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, the 9/11 attack in 2001, and the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, were all unusual and unexpected events that caught market participants by surprise. The initial effects of these events were a fall in asset prices and aggregate quantity of liquidity in financial market which deteriorated balance sheets of both borrowers and investors. Worsening of initial impacts developed into a flight-to-quality pattern, as the unusual and unexpected features of the events made market participants more risk and uncertainty averse, incurring more aggressive reactions compared to responses during other shocks. Liquidation of assets and withdrawals from financial market were severe, which made a risky group of borrowers have difficulties rolling over their liabilities and financing new credits. A recent development in theory explains various mechanisms which led to enhanced initial effects of a flight-to-quality pattern.Caballero, Ricardo and Pablo Kurlat (2008). \\"Flight to Quality and Bailouts: Policy Remarks and a Literature Review.\\" Working Paper 08-21.Krishnamurthy, Arvind, 2010: \\"Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises.\\" American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2(3): 1–30. These mechanisms follow from an observation that a flight-to-quality pattern involves a combination of market participants' weakening balance sheet and risk aversion of asset payoffs, extreme uncertainty aversion, and strategic or speculative behavior of liquid market participants. A \\"balance sheet mechanism\\" focuses on institutional features of financial markets. It provides an explanation for feedback loop mechanisms between the asset prices and balance sheets, and investors' preference for liquidity. The idea is that if investors' balance sheets depend on asset prices under delegated investment management, then a negative asset price shock tightens the investors' balance sheets, forcing them to liquidate assets, and makes investors prefer more liquid and less risky assets. Forced liquidation and changes in investors' preferences further lower asset prices and deteriorate the balance sheets, amplifying the initial shock. VayanosVayanos, Dimitri (2004). \\"Flight to Quality, Flight to Liquidity, and the Pricing of Risk>\\" NBER Working Paper. models how a relationship between fund managers and clients can lead to effective risk aversion when illiquidity risk rises due to asset price volatility.

An \\"information amplification mechanism\\" focuses on a role of investor's extreme uncertainty aversion. When an unusual and unexpected event incurs losses, investors find that they do not have a good understanding about the tail outcome that they are facing and treat the risk as Knightian uncertainty.Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \\"Collective risk management in a Fight to quality episode.\\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230. An example is subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. Investors realized that they did not have good understanding about mortgage-backed securities which were newly adopted. Newly adopted financial innovation meant that market participants had only a short time to formulate valuation, and did not have enough history to refer to in their risk management and hedging models. Under Knightian uncertainty, investors respond by disengaging from risky activities and hoarding liquidity while reevaluating their investment models. They only take conservative approaches, investing on only safe and uncontingent claims, to protect themselves from worst-case scenarios related to the risk that they do not understand, which further deteriorates asset prices and financial market. A model of strategic or speculative behaviors of liquid investors provides another mechanism that explains flight-to-quality phenomenon. Acharya et alAcharya Viral, Denis Gromb, and Tanju Yorulmazer (2008). \\"Imperfect Competition in the Inter‐Bank Market for Liquidity.\\" Working Paper, London Business School. show that during financial turmoil liquid banks in interbank loan markets do not lend their liquidity to illiquid banks, nor hoard liquidity for precautionary reasons, but, rather, hoard them to purchase assets at distress prices. Brunnermeier and PedersenBrunnermeier, Markus and Lasse Pedersen (2005) \\"Predatory Trading.\\" The Journal of Finance, 60(4), 1825-1863. study strategic behaviors of liquid traders when they know that other traders need to liquidate their positions. The study shows that the strategic behaviors would lead to predatory pricing, which would lead the price of risky and illiquid assets to fall further than they would if price were based on risk consideration alone. Empirical studies Since flight-to- quality phenomenon implies a shift in investing behavior towards some safe group of assets from risky assets, efforts to find evidence on flight-to- quality have been concentrated on analyzing widening yields or quantity changes between two assets. A number of studies find stronger negative association between stock and bond markets during a financial turmoil. Flight- to-quality is also observable within a safe group of assets. LongstaffLongstaff, Francis (2004) \\"The Flight‐to‐Liquidity Premium in US Treasury Bond Prices.\\" The Journal of Business, 77(3):511‐526. finds a spread between Resolution Funding Corporation bonds, whose liabilities are guaranteed by Treasury, and US Treasury bonds increases when consumer confidence drops, money market mutual funds and Treasury buy backs increase. Krishnamurthy compares on-the-run and off-the-run treasury bonds to find higher spreads on off-the –run bonds are associated with higher spread between commercial paper and Treasury bonds. Beber et alBeber, Alessandro, Michael Brandt, and Kenneth A. Kavajecz (2009), Flight-to-quality or Flight-to-liquidity? Evidence from the Euro-area bond market, Review of Financial Studies 22, 925-957. make explicit distinction between flight-to-quality and flight-to-liquidity and find relative importance of liquidity over credit quality rises during flight- to-quality episodes.

This suggests that banks tend to be seen as safe havens in periods of turmoil. However, data shows that during 1998 the flight-to-quality episodes worsening relative position of banks compared to the very safe assets.Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \\"Collective risk management in a Fight to quality episode.\\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230. Real sector effects During a flight-to-quality episode external financing becomes harder for lower quality borrowers or riskier projects. Investors faced with tightened balance sheet and increased risk and uncertainty aversion reduce their investment and shift their portfolio only towards safer projects and high quality borrowers. Tightening external financing for lower quality borrowers may extend to real consequences of output loss and higher unemployment, therefore exacerbate business cycle. A series of studies show that amount and composition of firm's external financing from bank loans are countercyclical during flight-to quality periods. Kashyap et al Kashyap, Anil, Jeremy Stein, and David Wilcox (1993).\\"Monetary Policy and Credit Conditions: Evidence from the Composition of External Finance.\\" American Economic Review, 83(1), 78‐98. finds that quantity of commercial paper issuances of high quality firms increase relative to bank loans.

Policy implications A moral hazard concern generally provides a rationale that government should not intervene in a financial crisis.Caballero, Ricardo and Pablo Kurlat (2008). \\"Flight to quality and Bailouts: Policy Remarks and a Literature Review.\\" Working Paper 08-21. The argument is that a market participant who expects government bailouts or emergency financing would engage in excessive risk taking. However, various government policy tools have been proposed to alleviate the effect of flight-to-quality phenomenon. The argument for government intervention is that flight-to-quality phenomenon is a result of insufficient risk taking generated by Knightian uncertainty. There is also an inefficiency issue generated by externality that supports rationale for prudential policy. The externality is generated when in presence of illiquid market, each firm forced to sell illiquid assets depresses prices for everyone else but does not take this effect into account in its decision-making. The externality also enables strategic and speculative behaviors of liquid investors. Caballero and KrishnamurthyCaballero, Ricardo and Pablo Kurlat (2008). \\"Flight to quality and Bailouts: Policy Remarks and a Literature Review.\\" Working Paper 08-21. show that central bank acting as a lender of last resort would be effective when both balance sheet and information amplifier mechanisms are at work. For instance, a guarantee issuance by government or loans to distressed private sectors would sustain deteriorating asset prices, bring confidence back in financial market, and prevent fire sale of assets. Brock and ManskiBrock, Willian and Charles Manski (2008). \\"Competitive Lending with Partial Knowledge of Loan Repayment\\".

History Appleseed's first album was a tribute to Peter Seeger. Musselman approached musicians and others (writer Studs Terkel, actor Tim Robbins) to record a song written, adapted, or performed by Seeger. The result was Where Have All the Flowers Gone: The Songs of Pete Seeger. The album included versions of Seeger-related songs by Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne & Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Terkel, Robbins, and Ani DiFranco. The album won the American Federation of Independent Music Award for Top Independent Release of 1998\\". The duet by Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt on \\"Kisses Sweeter than Wine\\" was nominated for a 1999 Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration. In 2007, Appleseed worked with the Give Us Your Poor organization at UMass Boston to release Give Us Your Poor to raise funds and public awareness about homelessness in America. Among its exclusive tracks was the first collaboration between Bruce Springsteen and Pete Seeger. Heritage artists Many formerly high-profile musicians from the Sixties and Seventies have had their first studio recordings in years, sometimes decades, released on the Appleseed label. The worldwide icon of the spirit of the Sixties, Donovan, came to Appleseed to release his first CD in eight years, 2004's Beat Cafe. Tom Rush, one of the first artists to record songs by Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne and James Taylor, returned to the recording studio for the first time in 35 years and emerged with What I Know, his Appleseed debut, which was named 2009 Album of the Year by the International Folk Alliance organization based on airplay. David Bromberg had retired from recording in 1990 before cutting Try Me One More Time for Appleseed in 2007; the CD was nominated for a \\"Best Traditional Folk Album\\" Grammy. The Native American singer/songwriter/artist/activist Buffy Sainte-Marie released Running for the Drum, her first new CD in 13 years, on Appleseed in 2009. Jesse Winchester, another well-established performer from the Sixties, hadn't released a new studio album in ten years before 2009's Love Filling Station\\"Love Filling Station\\" was issued by Appleseed. His CD was named one of the year's best by VH1's Bill Flanagan on the CBS Sunday Morning television show,'Tis the Season: Gifts of Music - CBS Sunday Morning - CBS News Historical releases Some of the label's other releases were intended to keep important traditional music alive, such as Kim and Reggie Harris's Steal Away: Songs of the Underground Railroad and Get On Board: Underground Railroad & Civil Rights Freedom Songs, Vol. 2, which have been used as teaching tools by various black history museums and schools. In 2000, Appleseed released two discs of \\"field recordings\\" of traditional American folk songs collected by Anne and Frank Warner on trips down the Eastern Seaboard starting in 1938, Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still and Nothing Seems Better to Me: The Music of Frank Proffitt and North Carolina.\\"Nothing Seems Better to Me: The Music of Frank Proffitt and North Carolina\\" To celebrate its ten-year anniversary in 2007, Appleseed issued Sowing the Seeds – The 10th Anniversary, a two-CD sampler of catalogue highlights that also included exclusive new recordings by Pete Seeger & Bruce Springsteen (a second historic second collaboration), Donovan, Ani DiFranco, Kim and Reggie Harris, and several more new Pete tracks.

In the Spring, pigs were also hoisted up to fatten on the huge 'crop' of sea-birds' eggs. The pigs' coarse hair was used to make the strong rope needed for fowling.

In the mid-1960s, she led a series of Polish-Mongolian paleontological expeditions to the Gobi Desert. She was the first woman to serve on the executive committee of the International Union of Geological Sciences. Early life and education Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska was born in Sokołów Podlaski, Poland, on April 25, 1925. In 1928, her father, Franciszek Kielan, was offered a job for the Association of Agriculture and Trade Cooperatives in Warsaw, to which her family moved for five years. Zofia and family returned to Warsaw in 1934 and lived in the small town of Żoliborz. She began her studies in Warsaw, following the destruction after the war when the Nazis had attempted to completely destroy the city, resulting in the Department of Geology joining the ruins. She attended lectures given instead by the Polish paleontologist, Roman Kozłowski, in his own home. This is her where her passion began. She subsequently earned a master's degree in zoology and a paleontology doctorate at Warsaw University, where she later became a professor. 15 years later, she organized the first Polish-Mongolian paleontological quest to the Gobi Desert, and returned seven times. She became the first woman to serve on the committee of the International Union of Geological Sciences. Her findings remain arguably unmatched by any living expert. Career and research She was employed by the Institute of Paleobiology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. She held a number of functions in professional organizations in Poland and the United States. Her work included the study of Devonian and Ordovician trilobites from Central Europe (Poland and Czech Republic), leading several Polish-Mongolian paleontological expeditions to the Gobi Desert, and the discovery of new species of crocodiles, lizards, turtles, dinosaurs (notably Deinocheirus), birds and multituberculates. She is the author of the book Hunting for Dinosaurs, and a co-author of the book Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs. Her work was published widely in peer reviewed scientific journals, books and monographs. While at the University of Warsaw, she started her master's research. This allowed her to join expeditions with other paleontologists and make various contributions. Kielan-Jaworowska participated in her first paleontological excavation in 1947 along with a group of researchers from the Museum of Earth and the National Geological Institute. The excavations, led by the geologist Jan Czarnocki, took place in Poland's Świętokrzyskie Mountains in exposures of Middle Devonian strata. The group's work involved digging for soft rock and rinsing away the sediment, consisting of yellow marl, in running water while using a sieve to collect any fossils that were present. Kielan-Jaworowska spent two months with the group and specifically sought trilobite fossils, which became the focus of her master's thesis. She returned to specific sites in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains over the next three summers to continue developing her collection, which grew to over one hundred trilobite specimens. Kielan-Jaworowska was awarded her master's degree in 1949. She had been employed as an assistant in the University of Warsaw's Department of Paleontology since fall 1948. She worked there until 1952, teaching classes in paleontology for biology and geology students. During her expeditions from 1963 to 1971 to the Gobi Desert, she unearthed many dinosaurs and mammals from the Cretaceous and early Tertiary. Her findings were so extensive that, in 1965, her team had shipped over 20 tons of fossils back to Poland. One of her most notable finds was in 1971, when she discovered a Protoceratops and a young Velociraptor tangled in a struggle. The fossilization process of how these two remained intact in this position is still debated. Although her findings were mainly dinosaurs, she did not focus all her research on them. From 1949 to 1963, she concentrated on Paleozoic invertebrates, especially three-lobed water bugs called trilobites. They were among the oldest fossils commonly found. This led her to shift her focus on researching Mesozoic mammals in 1963. Kielan-Jaworowska has added a great deal of contribution to monographs that detail findings of fossils and wrote her own book, Hunting for Dinosaurs, which give brief descriptions of her paleontological endeavors in the Gobi Desert. The book was written in Polish and translated to English and published in 1969. The book notes her exchange with the Mongolian people, as well as the hardships she faced to achieve success in her life's work. In her research, she explored the asteroid theory regarding the mass extinction of dinosaurs. Kielan-Jaworowska concluded the book with noting how the research of the mass extinctions could promote awareness for future decades. Kielan- Jaworowska and her book gained international attention and fame. From 1960 to 1982, she was the director of the Institute of Paleobiology. In 1982, she stepped down from her position to undertake a visiting professorship at the Musée National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, which lasted for two years. Soon after her return to Warsaw, she was appointed Professor of Paleontology at the University of Oslo, which lasted from 1986 to 1995 when she was appointed Professor Emerita in the institute of Paleobiology.William A.

In 1999, Kielan-Jaworowska received the Righteous Among the Nations Medal. She was awarded the Romer- Simpson Medal in 1996, becoming the 8th recipient of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's award, which honors sustained and outstanding scholarly excellence in the discipline of vertebrate paleontology. In 2002, she also became the recipient of the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Her book, Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs, won her the prestigious Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science in 2005. Her work was recognized \\"for a creative synthesis of research on the Mesozoic evolution of mammals\\". Kielan-Jaworowska's co-author, Zhe-Xi Lou, describes her contribution to paleontology as unmatched by any living experts, and that \\"in the whole of Mesozoic mammalian studies for the last 100 years, only the late American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson would be her equal\\". \\"She is the rarest among the rare – she has been a leader in making important scientific contributions, and also a gregarious and charismatic figure, both of which have made paleontology a better science, and paleontologists worldwide a better community.\\" She was a member of the Polish Geological Society, Academia Europaea, Palaeontological Association, Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, Norwegian Paleontological Society, Polish Academy of Sciences as well as an honorary member of the Linnean Society of London, Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists and the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

When examined closely, the proof is less a statement about topology than a statement about certain properties of arithmetic sequences. Unlike Euclid's classical proof, Furstenberg's proof is a proof by contradiction. The proof was published in 1955 in the American Mathematical Monthly while Furstenberg was still an undergraduate student at Yeshiva University. Furstenberg's proof Define a topology on the integers Z, called the evenly spaced integer topology, by declaring a subset U ⊆ Z to be an open set if and only if it is either the empty set, ∅, or it is a union of arithmetic sequences S(a, b) (for a ≠ 0), where :S(a, b) = \\\\\\\\{ a n + b \\\\mid n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\\\\\} = a \\\\mathbb{Z} + b. In other words, U is open if and only if every x ∈ U admits some non-zero integer a such that S(a, x) ⊆ U. The axioms for a topology are easily verified: * By definition, ∅ is open; Z is just the sequence S(1, 0), and so is open as well. * Any union of open sets is open: for any collection of open sets Ui and x in their union U, any of the numbers ai for which S(ai, x) ⊆ Ui also shows that S(ai, x) ⊆ U. * The intersection of two (and hence finitely many) open sets is open: let U1 and U2 be open sets and let x ∈ U1 ∩ U2 (with numbers a1 and a2 establishing membership). Set a to be the lowest common multiple of a1 and a2. Then S(a, x) ⊆ S(ai, x) ⊆ Ui. This topology has two notable properties: # Since any non- empty open set contains an infinite sequence, a finite set cannot be open; put another way, the complement of a finite set cannot be a closed set. # The basis sets S(a, b) are both open and closed: they are open by definition, and we can write S(a, b) as the complement of an open set as follows: ::: S(a, b) = \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup_{j = 1}^{a - 1} S(a, b + j). The only integers that are not integer multiples of prime numbers are −1 and +1, i.e. ::: \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{ -1, + 1 \\\\\\\\} = \\\\bigcup_{p \\\\mathrm{\\\\, prime}} S(p, 0). By the first property, the set on the left-hand side cannot be closed. On the other hand, by the second property, the sets S(p, 0) are closed. So, if there were only finitely many prime numbers, then the set on the right-hand side would be a finite union of closed sets, and hence closed. This would be a contradiction, so there must be infinitely many prime numbers.

In addition to extensive mission work in Japan, and touring South East Asia, he wrote a number of penetrating expositions of Christian scriptures. Early life Walsingham Grammar School buildings Wilkes was born on at Titchwell, Norfolk, the second son of Rev. Alpheus Wilkes and his wife Mary Davies. He was and brought up in Little Walsingham where his father, an austere evangelical from Yorkshire, was headmaster of the Grammar School and also vicar of West Barsham. His mother was the daughter of Henry Davies, bookseller, publisher and newspaper editor of Cheltenham. She was vivacious and nicknamed \\"y Deryn\\" for her lovely singing voice, while Wilkes was heavy and serious, a contrast that was too marked to make for harmony.Isabel R C Stewart Dynamic Paget Wilkes of Japan (1957) Paget Wilkes and his elder brother Lewis were initially taught at home in an environment of strict simplicity and discipline. Few pleasures were permitted, and little variety came into their lives. Their mother died when Paget was thirteen and following the remarriage of his father in 1886, the family home became a centre for highly religious spinsters.Mary W D Pattison Ablaze for God – The life story of Paget Wilkes (1937) Wilkes went to Bedford School and Lincoln College, Oxford.Bedford School Register May 1887, entry number 1768 Inspired by a meeting led by Frederick Brotherton Meyer, he became a devoted Christian and during his three years at Oxford he spent part of his vacations in Christian work helping in the work of the Children's Special Service Mission. There was a strong Christian zeal at Oxford at the time, and in those ten years 60 missionaries went from Oxford. Wilkes was particularly inspired by Richard Reader Harris and his Pentecostal League.Isabel R C Stewart Dynamic Paget Wilkes of Japan (1957) Mission work Japan, with the Kansai region containing Kobe highlighted In 1898 Wilkes began his mission work in Japan at Matsue and Osaka on the invitation of Barclay Buxton, who first went to Japan in 1890. They returned to England in 1902. In 1903 at the Keswick Convention, Wilkes and Buxton founded the Japan Evangelistic Band (or JEB). The Band was devoted to aggressive evangelism and personal holiness. The work of the JEB, now known as JCL, has led to the establishment of the Kansai Bible College in Kobe and over 150 churches in Japan. Over the next 20 years Wilkes and his wife spent their time alternating between England and Japan where he was based at Kobe. In 1907 the Japanese climate was affecting their son's health and he needed to go to school in England, so Mrs Wilkes returned to England and the following year Paget followed them back and stayed in England for 18 months. In April 1910, Wilkes returned to Japan on a tour described in his \\"Missionary Joys in Japan\\". He travelled via Moscow and the Trans-Siberian Railway and reported floods at Karuizawa, the convention at Arima Onsen and a tour which included Kōfu, Yamanashi Nagasaki, Fukuoka and Nakatsu. In 1911 he visited Korea and made a tour in the north of Japan taking in Morioka. He returned to England in June 1912.Paget Wilkes Missionary Joys in Japan (1913) The Wilkes were back in Kobe at the beginning of 1913 and returned to England on 1915, to be with their son. Wilkes went back to Japan on his own in 1918 via North America through New York City and San Francisco. His son was at the Front in Flanders and Wilkes received cables, one saying he had been gassed and was in hospital in Liverpool and another later one that he had been captured at the Front and sent to Germany. After returning to England, Wilkes went back to Japan in August 1923 and in July 1925 landed at Shanghai on a mission to China. It was there that he inspired Dr. Ji Zhiwen (计志文, anglicised as Andrew Gih), the founder of the Evangelize China Fellowship, and Zhao Shiguang, the founder of the Bread of Life church. In 1926 Wilkes and his wife were back in England and then visited his sister Mary Dunn Pattison then leading a Christian group at Chalet Point du Jour near Geneva. After visiting South Africa in the spring of 1927 for 6 months, Wilkes revisited Switzerland in Autumn 1927. He was particularly active, travelling over 4000 miles and holding 220 meetings, and as a result his health was impaired. He left England in February 1928 but was taken ill on arrival in Canada. So he returned to England and then Switzerland where he stayed at the Spiritual centre at Vennes. His activity was much reduced but he still revisited Japan for the last time in 1930.Mary W D Pattison Ablaze for God – The life story of Paget Wilkes (1937) Writing Wilkes produced a number of significant expositions of the scripture including the \\"Dynamic\\" series, \\"Salvation\\" and \\"Sanctification\\".

He is one of the iconic figures of the musical movement called Trova Rosarina, a famous generation of singers and composers based in the city of Rosario, who came to prominence during the 80's, and were famous for their groundbreaking work in pop music, with a sound rooted in rock, tango and \\"folklore argentino\\". Career In the early 1980s, Baglietto (3rd from the right) was the spearhead of the Argentine music trend called trova rosarina. Juan Carlos Baglietto in concert, November 2010 Baglietto was a member of various small bands until \\"Irreal\\" was formed, in 1980, comprising himself, Juan Chianelli (keyboards), Jorge Llonch (bass), \\"Piraña\\" Fegundez (flute), Alberto Corradini (guitar) and Daniel Wirtz (drums). They attracted a big audience to their concerts, but were always pursued by the censors of the Proceso. Halfway through 1981 Baglietto launched himself as a solo musician. He made his début in Buenos Aires, but he didn't achieve a breakthrough until he became the surprise hit of the Festival de La Falda in 1982. By this time, he had armed himself with a supporting group consisting of Silvina Garré as a backing singer, Fito Páez as keyboardist, Rubén Goldín on guitar, Sergio Sainz on bass and José \\"Zappo\\" Aguilera on drums. With this band, he recorded Tiempos difíciles, the first Argentine rock album to achieve a gold disc. Many of its tracks, like Mirta, de regreso or Era en abril, were widely played on the radio stations of the capital and this fuelled the success of his concert in Obras, right after the Falklands War. This success affected a little the sales of Actuar para vivir, the following album. In May 1983 a concert in Obras, of all the Rosarian musicians, was organised, called El Rosariazo. Baglietto performed together with Litto Nebbia, Silvina Garré y Fabián Gallardo. His band filled the Astral theatre five nights in a row, billed as \\"Baglietto\\". In November 1984 he performed the show \\"Por qué cantamos\\", together with Celeste Carballo, Nito Mestre and Oveja Negra. Modelo para armar (1985) was the first disc since his collaboration with Fito Páez, in which Baglietto tried to make a break with the style that he had been associated. For this, he specially composed all-new material. His subsequent disc, Acné (1986) is an hommage \\"to the music I grew up with.\\" Having this in mind, he chose tracks that hadn't originally been hits, for example Los días de Actemio (by Los Gatos) or Tema de Pototo (by Almendra). In September 1986, he performed in front of an audience of 100,000 at the Monumento a la Bandera in Rosario, Argentina, as part of the festivals for \\"Mil Días en Democracia,\\" (a thousand days of democracy) alongside Fito Páez, Silvina Garré y Antonio Tarragó Ros. Mami (1988) was recorded after a year and a half of silence, accompanied by Sergio Sainz (bass), Eduardo Rogatti (guitar), Marco Pusineri (drums) and Rubén Goldín (vocals). Since his second album, Baglietto and Garré had worked together sporadically. In 1990, they made the decision to perform a show together in which they would record a live disc, with the justification: \\"This collaboration gives us the possibility to demonstrate how different we can be. With the years, we have been moving further apart in style, but even so, we work well together.\\" His next work, Ayúdame a mirar (1990), is a completely acoustic recording, with guitars and percussion, for which a variety of composers contributed tracks: Adrián Abonizio, Rubén Goldín, Chico Buarque, Mezo Bigarrena and Joaquín Sabina, among others. On a more traditional vein, together with Lito Vitale he headed a collaboration that culminated in Postales de este lado del mundo (1991), an album which included themes from popular traditional Argentine composers, like Carlos Gardel, Homero Manzi, the brothers Expósito, Mariano Mores, Enrique Santos Discépolo and María Elena Walsh. Luz quitapenas (1996) was a reunion of the musicians that accompanied him when he was starting out: Adrián Abonizio, Fito Páez, Jorge Fandermole and Rubén Goldín. Two years later, 15 años (1998) was recorded live during one of the shows in the Opera theatre. The album is a collection of his most important hits, with the participation of artists such as León Gieco, Fito Páez, Ana Belén, Joaquín Sabina and Alejandro Lerner. In 1998, Juan Carlos Baglieto recorded the theme \\"Paths of the Soul\\" next to Kennedy Choir and with more than 120 Argentine artists under the direction of Instrumental pianist and conductor Nazareno Andorno. In 2001 he went back to work with Lito Vitale, together with Lucho González as a guest musician.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. Biography Born in Berlin in 1886, Knobelsdorff joined the army of Imperial Germany in 1905 as a Fahnen-junker (officer cadet) and served in the infantry. Twice awarded the Iron Cross during World War I, he later served in the Heer (Army) branch of the Wehrmacht. He was chief of staff of Corps Command XXXIII at the time of the outbreak of World War II. A generalmajor, he was given command of the 19th Infantry Division on 1 February 1940 and led it through the Battle of France and during subsequent occupation duty. In October, the division was withdrawn to Germany for conversion to armour. It was re-designated the 19th Panzer Division and Knobelsdorff, promoted to generalleutnant in late 1940, oversaw his command's transition from infantry to tanks. With Knobelsdorff still in command, the division was sent to Russia as part of Operation Barbarossa and fought through to the outskirts of Moscow. In early 1942, he was acting commander of X Army Corps and fulfilled the same role for II Army Corps in mid-1942, when it was involved in the Demyansk Salient. He then commanded XXIV Panzer Corps, still as acting commander, before being given a permanent role leading XXXXVIII Panzer Corps from late 1942 to late 1943, although he spent three months out of the lines during this time. Now a General der Panzertruppe (General of Panzer Troops), during this period he was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross that he had been awarded in 1941 while leading the 19th Panzer Division and the German Cross in gold. Competent as a leader of armoured formations, Knobelsdorff was given command of 1st Army in September 1944, serving in France at the time. Although awarded the Swords to his Knight's Cross the same month, he proved less adept at this level and was ultimately relieved in November 1944 for resisting Adolf Hitler's efforts to transfer 1st Army's tanks away in support of the Ardennes offensive. He ended the war without another command. In later life, he wrote Geschichte der niedersaechsischen 19. Panzer-Division, a history of the 19th Panzer Division which was published in 1958. He died in Hannover in 1966.

The call letters stand for \\"What U Always Wanted\\". The first Professional Announcer on the air was Durant Cameron, who was a student in the first class of Radio TV Broadcasting at Triton High School in the fall of 1987. Durant Cameron now works as the Master Control Room Operator at WBTV in Charlotte, NC. Former Superintendent of Harnett County Schools, the late Ivo Wortmann Jr. pushed button to place the transmitter on the air for the first broadcast. The first song played was \\"A New Day for You\\" by Basia, from the album entitled \\"Time and Tide\\". The students in the Radio TV curriculum Senior Class of 1990 (Susan Avery, James Ball, Carla Hall, Donna Knowles, Jennifer Lucas, Robin Lyons, Melbourne Manning, Reggie McLean, Trisha Murphy, Jay Smith, and Kipp Thompson) were the air personalities on that first day. The students in the Radio TV curriculum Junior Class of 1990 (Ron Barefoot, Ken Blackmon, Kelvin Gilbert, John Jarman, David Kniffen, Michelle Nelson, Chris Peeples, Denise Stone, Julie Walker, and Bill Warren) handled the news, sports and weather on that first broadcast day and until the end of the 1989-1990 school year. Dr. Anthony Harrington, the first Radio TV Curriculum instructor, and a 1977 graduate of the CCTI Radio TV Curriculum closed that first day's activities at 6:00 PM EDST. During the summer of 1990, WUAW's 3,000-watt signal with its tower at 191 feet (63 meters) in height has been heard as far north as Emporia, Virginia, and outside Greensboro, North Carolina; and as far south as Ellerbee, North Carolina and Shallote, North Carolina.

It is considered to be part of the city of Takehara, Hiroshima Prefecture. It is accessible by ferry from Tadanoumi and Ōmishima. There are campsites, walking trails and places of historical interest on the island. It is often called because of the numerous feral rabbits that roam the island. The rabbits are rather tame and will approach humans. Ōkunoshima played a key role during World War II as a poison gas factory for much of the chemical warfare that was carried out in China.Ian Buruma, The Wages of Guilt: Memories of War in Germany and Japan, (New York: Meridan, 1994), 111. History The ruins of the gas manufacturing plant (and the power station pictured here that supplied it) are still standing today. The island was a cultivated area until the Russo-Japanese War when ten forts were built to protect it. Three fishing families lived on the island. In 1925, the Imperial Japanese Army Institute of Science and Technology initiated a secret program to develop chemical weapons, based on extensive research that showed that chemical weapons were being produced throughout the United States and Europe.Yuki Tanaka. \\"Poison Gas: The Story Japan Would Like To Forget\\". Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, October 1998. pp. 10-19. Reproducing documents from the Historical Records Office, Repatriation Relief Bureau, Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. A chemical munitions plant was built on the island between 1927 and 1929 and was home to a chemical weapons facility that would go on to produce over six kilotons of mustard gas and tear gas. Japan was a signatory of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which banned the use of chemical warfare but not the development and storage of chemical weapons. Nevertheless, Japan went to great lengths to keep the chemical munitions plant a secret, even going so far as to remove records of the island from some maps.\\"The Beginning of the Gas Plants,\\" (Ōkunoshima Poison Gas Museum Exhibit: Ōkunoshima Island, Hiroshima Prefecture), visited December 10, 2006. The island was chosen for its isolation, security, and distance from Tokyo and other areas in case of disaster. Under the jurisdiction of the Japanese military, the local fish preservation processor was converted into a toxic gas reactor. Residents and potential employees were not told what the plant was manufacturing and everything was kept secret. Working conditions were harsh and many suffered from toxic-exposure related illnesses due to inadequate safety equipment. When World War II ended, documents concerning the plant were burned and Allied Occupation Forces disposed of the gas either by dumping, burning, or burying it. People were told to be silent about the project, and several decades would pass before victims from the plant were given government aid for treatment. In 1988 the Ōkunoshima Poison Gas Museum was opened. Present day Rabbits on the island The island is presently inhabited by a large population of rabbits. Many of them are descended from rabbits intentionally let loose when the island was developed as a park after World War II. During the war, rabbits were also used in the chemical munitions plant to test the effectiveness of the chemical weapons, but those rabbits were killed when the factory was demolished and are not related to the rabbits currently on the island.毒ガス資料館元館長村上氏へのインタビュー(in Japanese) (interview to Mr. Murakami, the former director of the poison gas museum) NPO Citizen Science Initiative Japan (CSIJ) Hunting the rabbits is forbidden, and dogs and cats are not allowed on the island. In 2015, the BBC presented a short television series called Pets - Wild at Heart about the behaviours of pets and it featured the rabbits on the island. The series also showed tourists coming to feed the rabbits. The ruins of the old forts and the gas factory still exist all over the island, but entry is prohibited as it is too dangerous. Since it is part of the Inland Sea National Park system of Japan, there is a resource center and a museum. Poison Gas Museum The Poison Gas Museum opened in 1988 to educate people about the island's role in World War II. The Poison Gas Museum was opened in 1988 and \\"was established in order to alert as many people as possible to the dreadful truths about poison gas.\\"\\"Ōkunoshima Poison Gas Museum,\\" (Ōkunoshima Poison Gas Museum Exhibit: Ōkunoshima Island, Hiroshima Prefecture), visited December 10, 2006. As expressed by its curator, Murakami Hatsuichi, to The New York Times, “My hope is that people will see the museum in Hiroshima City and also this one, so they will learn that we [Japanese] were both victims and aggressors in the war. I hope people will realize both facets and recognize the importance of peace.\\"Nicholas D. Kristof, “Okunoshima Journal; A Museum to Remind Japanese of Their Own Guilt,” The New York Times, August 12, 1955, sec. 1, p. 2. The small museum is only two rooms large and provides a basic overview of the construction of the chemical plant, working conditions, and the effects of poison gas on humans. Families of workers who suffered the aftereffects of the harsh working conditions donated numerous artifacts to help tell the story of the workers' plight. The second room shows how poison gas affects the human body through the lungs, eyes, skin, and heart. Images of victims from Iraq and Iran add to the message of the museum. The museum also offers guides to the numerous remains of the forts from the Second Sino-Japanese War and the poison gas factory. Most of the buildings are run-down and condemned, but still recognizable. The museum is aimed primarily at Japanese tourists, but English translations are provided on the overall summary for each section.  Other buildings and structures  Ōmishima, in the southeast.

The Library is an integral part of the UWA student experience and provides a wide range of services, facilities and resources to both students and staff and the community including teaching, learning and research support, student IT support, and individual and collaborative learning spaces.  History  When the University of Western Australia began teaching students in 1913 and the first building was constructed at the Irwin Street site, just £2000 was set aside for the purchase of roughly 100 books.Hawkes, Emma. “History of the Collection of The University of Western Australia Library, 1913 – 1999”. 1999 By the time the campus moved to Crawley, there were over 10,000 volumes and a dedicated librarian. The next thirty years saw steady but modest growth in the collections. Library services at Crawley initially operated out of the Main Library which was set up in a wing of the Administration building (now the Visitors Centre). By the early 1960s, overcrowding had become a significant issue leading to the Winthrop Hall Undercroft being enclosed and then re- opened as a temporary library annexe consisting of the Reserve collection for undergraduates and bound volumes of periodicals. It was not until Leonard Jolley became the University Librarian in 1959 that the Library began to expand its collections rapidly, to experiment with new forms of information technology, to erect major new library buildings, and to bring departmental libraries under central responsibility. A Music branch library had been set up as early as 1935, many years before the UWA Music department was established. In the 1960s, the library was named the Wigmore Music Library following substantial gifts from violinist Alice Ivy Wigmore in honor of her mother.Bolton, G.C. & Morant, Andrew. “Wigmore, Alice Ivy (1895–1982)” Australian Dictionary of Biography, vol 18, (MUP), 2012.. A purpose-built building for the Wigmore Music Library was opened in 1976, including discussion rooms and areas for informal study. This library building was repurposed in 2020 by the UWA Conservatorium of Music as a space for practice and performance, and is now called the Wigmore Music Studio.\\"University Library Summer 2019-2020 Improvements\\". University News, 28 November 2019. The Music Library collection, now housed in Reid Library, includes scores, performing editions of musical works, sound-recordings, DVDs/videos, reference books, and scholarly journals. Technological improvements became even more significant in the 1980s as Arthur Ellis, Jolley's successor as University Librarian, worked to expand the collections of audio-visual and electronic materials and began the process of computerising the Library's catalogues.Burrows, Toby. \\"Collecting and informing: the University Library\\", in Seeking Wisdom: a Centenary History of The University of Western Australia, edited by Jenny Gregory with Jean Chetkovich (Crawley, W.A.: UWA Publishing, 2013), pp. 147-158 By 2000, the Library consisted of 11 library sites. The 2000s-2010s saw the introduction of online information literacy delivery, a Course Materials Online (CMO) service and the launch of OneSearch, the Library’s single search tool for finding books, journal articles and online resources. A steady increase in the number of UWA students owning laptops and tablets resulted in demand for student IT support and for the first time in Semester 1, 2013, students could go to the information desks in the libraries for assistance with Pheme passwords, Unifi connections, Learning Management System (LMS) troubleshooting, online class registrations (OLCR) and other university applications and systems.Cluett, L.J. “TechNODE bulletin 2013: an annual synopsis of student access to, experiences with and expectations of ICT at The University of Western Australia”. 2013 =University Librarians at UWA= There have been six University Librarians at UWA since 1927 when Malvina Evelyn Wood became the first female University Librarian in Australia. * Malvina Evelyn Wood (1927 – 1959) * Leonard Jolley (1959 – 1979) * Arthur Ellis (1980 – 1995) * John Arfield (1996 – 2010) * Dr Mary Davies (2010 – 2014) * Jill Benn (2014 – Present) Library Buildings =Reid Library= A panoramic view from the first floor entrance of the Reid Library looking North in the direction of the Tropical Grove Named after Sir Alexander Reid (UWA Chancellor 1956-1968), the Reid Library opened its doors to readers in February 1964, with its official opening taking place the following May.

When it opened in 1964, the Reid Library had 800 desks, and attracted 841,609 visitors in its first year. By August 1965, opening hours had been extended to reflect student demand and the building was subsequently extended during 1971-1972 to provide even more desks. Since then, the Reid Library has continued to adapt to changing student needs and radical technological changes by offering 24/7 building access, flexible student spaces and joint study skills drop-in sessions with Student Services. =Barry J Marshall Library= The Barry J Marshall Library opened at the southern end of the campus in 2008, combining the collections from the former Biological Sciences Library, Mathematics and Physical Sciences Library, psychology and geography and offering almost 1000 seats and 200 computers. The flexible and collaborative learning spaces were particularly popular with students who embraced the new library by creating online videos and Facebook fan pages. The Barry J Marshall Library is currently trialling a 3D printer. The library is named after UWA alumnus and Nobel Prize winner, Barry Marshall. =Beasley Law Library= A branch law library was set up at UWA in 1928, the year after the Law Faculty was established. The early Law collection was mainly built by the first Chair of Law at UWA, Professor Beasley, who the library building was subsequently named after when it opened in 1967. Refurbishments to the Beasley Law Library in late 2005 were a response to the changing needs of law students and included a more open and welcoming entrance, increased access to computers (including after-hours access), and additional collaborative working areas. =Education, Fine Arts and Architecture (EDFAA) Library= The Education, Fine Arts and Architecture (EDFAA) Library is located on the Nedlands campus and was opened in 1993. The EDFAA Library sustained significant flood damage during the 2010 Western Australian storms which resulted in nearly 12,000 items in the collection being ruined. The new EDFAA Library, which was re-opened in February 2012, was designed by UWA graduate Honey Hiranandani and includes group study rooms with multimedia equipment for student collaboration, a teaching room for flexible learning and RFID technology for self-service loans. =J Robin Warren Library= The J Robin Warren Library (formerly known as Medical and Dental Library) is located on Monash Avenue next to the Oral Health Centre of Western Australia and the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre. The opening of the library at the end of 2001 brought together the collections which had outgrown the spaces available at the Medical Library on the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital site and the Dental Library housed in the Perth Dental Hospital. At the time of its official opening in April 2002 by Sir Ronald Wilson, it was recognised as the largest medical and dental collection in Western Australia . The library is named after Professor (John) Robin Warren, a co-recipient, with Professor Barry J Marshall, of the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2005 for their discovery that stomach ulcers were caused by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. Special Collections The Library's Special Collections are housed on the second floor of the Reid Library building and focus on Australian literature and the history of the Indian Ocean Region. The Australian literature collection includes more than 700 volumes of poetry by Western Australian writers and personal papers from many well-known Australian authors including A.B. Facey, Arthur Upfield, Robert Drewe, John Kinsella, Tracy Ryan, Dave Warner, Dennis Haskell and Peter Cowan. The archives of the literary magazine Westerly are also available. Special Collections houses many rare materials including the papers of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville which contain more than 2,000 pages of correspondence and documents relating to the East India Company and Indian trade in the later 18th century, and an original 1650 map of the southern ocean, Polus Antarcticus by Dutch cartographer Jan Jansson. The Indian Ocean collections also include the Frank Broeze Memorial Library which contains a considerable amount of Dutch and German material on maritime history and shipping, and the Erulkar Collection focused on the history of the Eastern Indian Ocean region, especially the maritime history of India. The Friends of the UWA Library The Friends of the UWA Library held their inaugural meeting in Winthrop Hall on July 25, 1965 . Later that year, Sir Walter Murdoch became the patron and they hosted their first talk with Mr G.G. Allen presenting on 'Old Books in a Modern Library'. Over the years, the Friends have been tireless supporters of the Library and have donated many rare and valuable items for Special Collections in the Reid Library. Digital research initiatives The Library developed and manages the UWA Research Repository which is an open access platform to capture, store, index, and distribute globally a wide range of research outputs produced by the University's researchers and postgraduate students . It contains peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, books, conference papers and creative works as well as UWA theses (masters and doctorate degrees by research). The Library (previously, as Information Services) developed two digital services for the management of research data: * The Institutional Research Data Store (IRDS) provides researchers with a centralised, secure and UWA-supported data storage facility in which to store electronic research data, enabling ongoing access to these assets. This service is now managed by Information Governance Services (IGS); and * Research Data Online (RDO) provides open or mediated access to research datasets held at the University of Western Australia. =Australian digital initiatives= The Library has also developed or contributed to the following Australian digital services : * Management of Australian National Data Service (ANDS) projects and contribution to Research Data Australia; * AustLit is a resource for information about Australian literature, for which the UWA Library is the Western Australian node; * Australian Data Archive; * Guide to Australian Literary Manuscripts: a collection of more than eighty finding aids for literary manuscript collections in major Australian research libraries (using Encoded Archival Description); and * HuNI (Humanities Networked Infrastructure) Virtual Laboratory.

Breckenridge High School's mascot is a Buckaroo (a cowboy riding a bucking horse). In 2014 the University Interscholastic League (UIL) released district realignments for many high schools in Texas. As a result of this realignment, Breckenridge High School went from being a 2A school to 3A. Athletics The Breckenridge Buckaroos compete in the following sports The Athletics Department Cross Country, Football, Volleyball, Basketball, Golf, Tennis, Track, Softball, Baseball Football Breckenridge's football success goes back to oil boom era in the late 1920s. P. E. Shotwell, who coached the Buckaroos from 1927–34, guided the team to the state finals in 1929, where they tied Port Arthur Jefferson 0–0 in the snowy weather of Waco. Under coach Eck Curtis (1935–44) they made the semifinals in 1942. Despite Breckenridge's declining population as the oil boom faded, the Buckaroos still played some of the largest schools in West Central Texas. With an enrollment of less than 400 students during the 1950s, Breckenridge's football varsity barely comprised 30 players. Yet, during the 1950s the Buckaroos formed a true dynasty under head coaches Cooper Robbins (1945–51), Joe Kerbel (1952–54) and Emory Bellard (1955–59). Breckenridge appeared in five Class 3A State Championship games, winning four times in 1951, 1952, 1954, and 1958 and tying Cleburne for the title in 1959.Dave Campbell's Texas Football, 2008 edition, page 362Breckenridge's two co-championships in 1929 and 1959 tie it with Cleburne (ironically, its 1959 opponent) for the most co-championships in UIL football; as UIL has adopted NCAA overtime rules, no other school can achieve this distinction.

Biography It has been speculated that Rufius Volusianus may have been the son of Caeionius Varus, the Praefectus urbi of Rome in AD 284.Christian Settipani, Continuité gentilice et continuité familiale dans les familles sénatoriales romaines à l’époque impériale: mythe et réalité, Prosopographica et Genealogica, vol. 2 (Linacre College, Oxford, 2000) His early career is unknown, but it is speculated that he held a suffect consulship around 280 under the emperor Probus.Martindale & Jones, pg. 977 Around 282 he was appointed by the emperor Carinus to the proconsular position of Corrector Italiae, with his area of administration being centred on central and southern Italy. He held this post until about 290. From 305 to 306, Volusianus was appointed the proconsular governor of Africa. When the Roman usurper Maxentius was recognized as emperor in Africa, Volusianus attached himself to his court. Around 309, Volusianus was made Maxentius’ Praetorian Prefect, an office he held until 310. He was sent by Maxentius to recover the province of Africa, which had rebelled and acclaimed Domitius Alexander emperor, causing severe food shortages in Rome. He crossed over to Africa with a small but well-trained force and proceeded to defeat the poorly armed rebels. His troops then wrought havoc in Carthage and other African cities. Volusianus then trapped Alexander in Cirta which was sacked. The captured Alexander was strangled, and his supporters were purged from their positions of authority and killed. Having reclaimed the province, Volusianus returned to Rome.Barnes, Timothy, Constantine and Eusebius (1981), pg. 33 As a reward for his service in North Africa, from 28 October 310 to 28 October 311, Volusianus was the Praefectus urbi of Rome. This was a special honor, as his taking up the posting in October 310 coincided with the very day five years before when Maxentius was acclaimed as emperor.Chenault, pg. 27 From September 311 until the end of the year, he was the consul of Maxentius alongside Aradius Rufinus. This may have been an attempt to appease the aristocracy of Rome who were becoming discontented with Maxentius’ rule.Bagnall, pg. 156 With the defeat and death of Maxentius at the hands of Constantine I in 312, Volusianus transferred his loyalty to the new emperor. He was recognized as one of the Comiti domini nostri Constantini invicti et perpetui semper Augusti (or Companion of the emperor Constantine), making him one of several senators who served under both Maxentius and Constantine, and his subsequent career under Constantine showed that the emperor was conscious of the need to win over the loyalty of the senatorial elite in Rome.Van Dam, pg. 129 As his periods in office during the reign of Maxentius were not recognized,Bagnall, pg. 162 Volusianus was again appointed Urban Prefect of Rome, a position he held from 8 December 313 until 20 August 315. During this period he was also styled iudex sacrarum cognitionum, meaning he presided over judicial cases in the name of the emperor.Martindale & Jones, pgs. 977-978 This was followed by his appointment as consul prior alongside Petronius Annianus in 314. In gratitude for these appointments, Volusianus erected a statue of Constantine in Trajan's Forum, dedicated to the “restorer of the human race, enlarger of the Roman empire and dominion, and founder of eternal security.” He also may have played a role in the construction of the Arch of Constantine, which was dedicated to the emperor after Constantine returned to Rome in July 315.Chenault, pgs. 27-28; 113 However, in late 315, Volusianus was dismissed from office and later exiled by decree of the Senate as a result of his enemies gaining the ear of the emperor and bringing him into disgrace.Chenault, pg. 43; Cameron, pg. 138; Van Dam, pg. 162 Volusianus was a member of the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis as well as possibly being one of the Septemviri epulonum.Martindale & Jones, pg. 978 His family owned lands in Volaterrae and North Africa.

Qazi fled the country and was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, sparking a four-year international manhunt. He was captured by a joint FBI-CIA/ISI task force in Pakistan in 1997 and rendered to the US to stand trial.

Background  Mir Qazi, shortly after his capture in 1997 Mir Qazi (or Mir Aimal Kasi) was born in Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan, either on February 10, 1964, or January 1, 1967. He entered the US in 1991, taking a substantial sum of cash he had inherited on the death of his father in 1989.

This work would be decisive in his choice of target: \\"I used to pass this area almost every day and knew these two left-turning lanes [were] mostly people who work for CIA.\\" According to Qazi, he first thought of attacking CIA personnel after buying a Chinese-made AK-47 from a Chantilly gun store.

According to a CIA release, \\"all the victims were full-time or contract employees with the agency.\\" No other details were revealed. During his later confession, Qazi said that he only stopped firing because \\"there wasn't anybody else left to shoot\\", and that he only shot male passengers because, as a Muslim, \\"it would be against [his] religion to shoot females\\". He was surprised at the lack of an armed response: \\"I thought I will be arrested, or maybe killed in a shootout with CIA guards or police.\\" Qazi climbed back into his vehicle and drove to a nearby park. After 90 minutes of waiting, he realized that he was not being actively sought and drove back to his Reston apartment.

He learned from CNN news reports that police had misidentified his vehicle and did not have his license plate number. The next morning, he took a flight to Quetta. Qazi stated his motive in a prison interview with CNN affiliate WTTG Fox 5: \\"I was real angry with the policy of the U.S. government in the Middle East, particularly toward the Palestinian people.\\"ARCHIVES CNN Pakistani man executed for CIA killings November 15, 2002  Investigation  An investigative task force (named \\"Langmur\\" for \\"Langley murders\\") was drawn together from both the FBI and local Fairfax County police. They began sifting through recent AK-47 purchases in Maryland and Virginia—there had been at least 1,600 over the previous year alone. Mir Aimal Qazi's name was on the sales slip from a gun store in Chantilly, where he had exchanged another gun for the AK-47 just three days before the shootings. This information provided the first solid lead in the investigation when Qazi's roommate, Zahed Mir, reported him missing two days after the shootings. He also told police how Qazi would get angry watching CNN reports of attacks on Muslims–in particular, Qazi would later cite the US attacks on Iraq, Israeli killings of Palestinians, and CIA involvement in Muslim countries. Although Mir did not think much of it at the time, Qazi had said he wanted to do \\"something big\\", with possible targets, the White House, the Israeli Embassy, and the CIA. A police search of Qazi's apartment turned up the hidden AK-47 under the couch. Ballistics tests confirmed it was the weapon used in the shootings, and Qazi became the chief suspect of the investigation. He was listed as one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. The search focused on Pakistan, and agents spent the next four years following hundreds of leads, taking them as far afield as Thailand, but to no avail. Qazi would later reveal that he had spent this time being sheltered by fellow Pashtun tribesmen, in the border regions of Afghanistan, making only brief visits to Pakistan.  Capture and rendition  In May 1997, an informant walked into the U.S. consulate in Karachi and claimed he could help lead them to Qazi. As proof, he showed a copy of a driver's license application made by Qazi under a false name but bearing his photograph. Apparently, the people who had been sheltering Qazi were now prepared to accept the multimillion-dollar reward offer for his capture. Other sources claim they were pressured by the Pakistani government. Qazi stated \\"I want to make it clear (that) the people who tricked me ... were Pushtuns, they were owners of land in the Leghari and Khosa clan areas in Dera Ghazi Khan, but I will never name them.\\"Hasan, K. \\"How Aimal Kasi was betrayed \\", Daily Times (Pakistan), June 23, 2004. Qazi was near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, so the informant was told to lure Qazi into Pakistan where he could be more easily apprehended. Qazi was tempted with a lucrative business offer—smuggling Russian electronic goods into Pakistan—which brought him to Dera Ghazi Khan, in the Punjab province of Pakistan, where he checked into a room at Shalimar Hotel. At 4 am on the morning of June 15, 1997, an armed team of FBI agents, working with the Pakistani ISI, raided Qazi's hotel room to arrest him. His fingerprints were taken at the scene, confirming his identity. There is some dispute over where Qazi was taken next—U.S. authorities claim it was a holding facility run by Pakistani authorities, while Pakistani sources claim it was the U.S. embassy in Islamabad–before being flown to the U.S. on June 17 in a C-141 transport.Khan, R. \\"In search of truth\\", Dawn, November 24, 2002. During the flight, Qazi made a full verbal and written confession to the FBI. Qazi's extrajudicial rendition was controversial in Pakistan—no formal request for his extradition was made, and no extradition proceedings were initiated. U.S. authorities would later assert that the rendition was legal under an extradition treaty signed with the UK, before Partition when India was under colonial rule. Qazi argued against his rendition in court but his assertions were found to have no basis in law. The Court wrote:  Trial  On February 16, 1993, Qazi, then a fugitive, was charged with the capital murder of Darling, murder of Bennett, and three counts of malicious wounding for the other victims, along with related firearms charges. Qazi was tried by a Virginia state court jury over a period of ten days in November 1997, on a plea of not guilty to all charges. During the trial the defense introduced testimony from Dr. Richard Restak, a neurologist and also a neuropsychiatrist, that Qazi was missing tissue from his frontal lobes, a congenital defect that made it hard for him to judge the consequence of his actions. This testimony was re-iterated by another psychiatrist for the defense based upon independent examination. The jury found him guilty, and fixed punishment for the capital murder charge at death. On February 4, 1998, Qazi was sentenced to death for the capital murder of Darling, who was shot at the beginning of the attack and again after the other victims had been shot. Among his other punishments were a life sentence for the first-degree murder of Bennett, multiple 20-year sentences for the malicious woundings, and fines totalling $600,000. Possible vendetta  Days before Qazi's conviction in November 1997, four U.S. oil executives and their Pakistani taxi driver were shot dead in Karachi, in what has been described as a deliberate response to Qazi's guilty verdict.Knowlton, B. \\"Americans Abroad Face a Rising Risk of Terrorism\\", International Herald and Tribune, November 21, 1997.

Victims  The two fatalities resulting from Qazi's attack were Lansing H. Bennett M.D., 66, and Frank Darling, 28, both CIA employees. Bennett, with experience as a physician, was working as an intelligence analyst assessing the health of foreign leaders.\\"Lansing Bennett, Physician Slain Outside CIA\\", The Washington Post, January 27, 1993.

He holds more than two hundred patents worldwide, in such diverse fields as drug delivery, interactive media, and cryptography, and has lectured on these topics internationally. Fuisz is a member of the Board of Regents at Georgetown University, where he and his brother created an annual scholarship honoring their deceased elder sibling, and established the first endowed professorship at the Georgetown University School of Medicine. Early life and education Fuisz was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to Anton Fujs, a Slovenian immigrant from Murska Sobota and Margaret Matuš, a Slovenian-American whose parents had migrated from Prekmurje. Fuisz and his older brother Robert graduated from Bethlehem Catholic High School before attending Georgetown University, where they both studied biology and eventually completed medical school. After finishing his internship and residency at the Harvard Medical School Cambridge Hospital campus, Fuisz served as a general physician and lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy, and was stationed at the White House under the Johnson administration. Fuisz and his family hold dual citizenship in the United States and Slovenia, and Fuisz endowed the Richard and Lorraine Fuisz Library and the Zoltan Fuisz Scholarship Fund at the Moravian Academy for children of Slovenian ancestry. 1970s–1980s =Medcom and the Middle East= In the 1970s, Fuisz and his brother co-founded Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm producing educational and training materials for health-care providers and consumers; Medcom was responsible for the NBC reality show Lifeline, for which Robert Fuisz won an Emmy Award in 1979, and a series of CBS documentaries called The Body Human, which also received critical acclaim during its run from 1977 and 1984. Fuisz himself played the role of a physician in government-subsidized public health films. In 1971, Medcom acquired California-based Trainex Corporation, which supplied medical personnel training materials to the Middle East and north Africa. Fuisz learned Arabic so that he could better supervise Medcom's new division, and during this period Medcom became a top supplier of medical training to Middle Eastern militaries. Fuisz served as president and chief executive officer of Medcom from 1975 until 1982, when the company was purchased by Baxter International, the world's larger supplier of hospital equipment, for $52 million. Fuisz initially offered to stay on for a three- year transition period to introduce the new ownership to his clients, but he was instead fired by Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks. After Medcom's sale and Fuisz's removal, business declined dramatically in the company's two biggest markets, the United States and Saudi Arabia, and profits plummeted. Then, in 1985 Fuisz sued Baxter over his termination. In 1971, Baxter had built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s. Fuisz alleged that, in their efforts to be removed from the blacklist, Baxter had violated anti-boycott amendments to the 1979 Export Administration Act (EAA) specifically prohibiting boycotts of Israel, and that he had been fired for refusing to help bribe Arab officials in the process. Fuisz's wrongful termination suit was settled in May 1990, but the terms of the settlement agreement were sealed. Baxter had already sold the struggling Medcom subsidiary to Medcom Holding for $3.8 million in 1986. When Fuisz arrived at the Baxter offices in Deerfield, Illinois, to sign the settlement and collect his financial compensation of $800,000, Baxter CEO Loucks refused to meet with him; Fuisz later said that he realized at that moment \\"there was only one way this would end.\\" He claimed to have then spent $35,000 to obtain secret government documents describing Baxter's dealings with Syria, and he sent a 20-page memorandum to Baxter board members outlining his findings: he alleged that Baxter had sold their Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria, and that, for this reason, they had been removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989. With the help of the American Jewish Congress, he brought the anti-boycott charges to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti- Boycott Compliance (OAC). In 1991, the OAC referred the case to the Justice Department, resulting in the first-ever criminal prosecution of a company for violating anti-boycott laws in the U.S. In 1993, though the prosecution was unable to prove Fuisz's allegations, Baxter pleaded guilty to illegal delivery of information about its Israeli business to Arab officials (prohibited under export control provisions of the EAA) and was assessed $6.5 million in fines and penalties. =Folkon and the Soviet Union= In the 1980s, Fuisz was involved in a number of business ventures in the Soviet Union through Leopoldina Import-Export Inc., an international business consulting firm, and Folkon, Ltd., an oil exploration company. Working with a young Mikhail Khodorkovsky, then the head of the Young Communist League, Fuisz exported computers and other electronics to the Soviet Union through the Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity of the Youth, and he would later claim that his business helped to supply computers to the KGB. In 1988, Fuisz was approached by Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, to set up a modeling agency that would prepare young Soviet models for American markets. The first model Fuisz was to oversee was Yulia Sukhanova, the first- ever Miss USSR, but hard-liners in the Moscow City Council obstructed Fuisz's efforts to secure Sukhanova's visa. With Khodorkovsky's assistance, he was able to smuggle Sukhanova out of the country, though upon reaching the U.S. she cut ties with Fuisz after a dispute over his commissions. In the first of two depositions regarding Fuisz's knowledge of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, held in December 2000, Fuisz was prohibited from answering questions regarding the relationship between his Russian businesses and the Central Intelligence Agency – when asked if Folkon did any work for the CIA, whether it received any money from the CIA, or whether there were any links between the CIA and any of the companies operated by Fuisz, U.S. Attorney (DOJ) Anthony Coppolino raised objections precluding Fuisz's testimony on the grounds of state secrets privilege. In the second deposition, held in January 2001, when asked to describe his interactions with high-level Soviet officials, Fuisz claimed to have difficulty separating information gained in his capacity as director of the modeling agency from information gained in \\"his employment by the government\\", and that he was \\"prohibited by a contract with the government\\" from providing further clarification. 1990s =Terex libel suit= In January 1992, The New York Times published an article by journalist Seymour Hersh alleging that U.S. intelligence had helped to arm the Iraqi military during the 1990–91 Gulf War, naming Fuisz as its primary source. The article described an affidavit Fuisz had submitted to the Operations Subcommittee of U.S. House Committee on Agriculture, which was investigating American heavy equipment manufacturer Terex Corp. Fuisz, who had been involved in business in the Middle East for many years, was representing a Saudi family interested in purchasing a heavy equipment company when he was given a tour of the Terex plant in Motherwell, Scotland in September 1987. During the tour, Fuisz noticed two large armor-plated vehicles painted in desert camouflage with specially attached steel backs; the plant manager allegedly told Fuisz that the vehicles were Scud missile launchers being manufactured for the Iraqi military, and that they were being smuggled by modifying their serial numbers to disguise them as civilian mining vehicles. When Fuisz questioned Terex Vice President David Langevin about the vehicles, he claims he was told that the shipments had been requested by the CIA, with the cooperation of British intelligence. Fuisz's allegations were corroborated by a former Terex employee also interviewed by the House Committee, who had been fired after raising questions about the company's bookkeeping. Scud missiles were used extensively by Iraq during the Gulf War to strike coalition forces in Israel and Saudi Arabia. Fuisz claimed that he had attempted to bring Terex's arms deals to the attention of the House Committee on Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in 1987, but committee chairman John Dingell had refused to act – Terex was (at the time) owned by General Motors (GM), a major political constituent in Dingell's home state of Michigan, and Dingell's wife was the granddaughter of a GM founder and a senior officer in the company's governmental relations department. Fuisz did not press the issue again until Charlie Rose of the Agriculture Committee asked him for an affidavit; the Scud launchers were suspected of being funded with ear-marked agriculture money through the Atlanta branch of the Italian Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) – documents obtained in a 1989 raid on the bank revealed that Terex, through its independent British distributor, had sold dump truck chassis in 1988 to the Iraqi \\"Technical Corps for Special Projects, Project 395,\\" a code name for Saddam Hussein's missile program. Fuisz speculated that the Terex production was covered up out of fear of backlash from the patriotic demographic of American truck drivers, who drove vehicles manufactured almost exclusively by Fruehauf Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Terex. Both Terex and the CIA immediately denied any military relationship with Iraq, and in April 1992, Terex filed a $15 million libel suit against Hersh and Fuisz, claiming that Fuisz fabricated the story as retaliation against the company for declining to enter into a business deal. In March 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest in the trial and invoked the state secrets privilege to bar Fuisz from testifying in his own defense. The gag order claimed that the information Fuisz possessed was vital to the \\"nation's security or diplomatic relations\\", and could not be revealed \\"no matter how compelling the need for, and relevance of, the information\\", while empowering the government to \\"protect its interests in this case in the future\\" (effectively gagging Fuisz permanently). Alt URL In October 1994, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld the Justice Department's claim of state secrets privilege and by 1996 the suit had been dismissed. In December 1995, The New York Times issued a retraction and apology for Hersh's 1992 article, claiming that \\"neither The Times nor Mr. Hersh intended\\" to give the impression that Terex was supplying Scud missile launchers to Iraq, blaming errors made in the editorial process and \\"false information\\" supplied by Fuisz. The retraction noted that a 16-month federal investigation had determined \\"there is no credible evidence\\" that Terex supplied military equipment to Iraq, affirming that \\"The Times has no evidence that contradicts the task force's findings\\"; this conclusion was supported by a separate investigation by the British House of Commons in 1996. However, in December 2003, a 12,000 page dossier submitted by the Scottish newspaper Sunday Herald to the United Nations revealed that Terex, along with more than twenty other American firms, had in fact supplied Iraq with weapons technology during the 1990s; Scottish Labour MP Tam Dalyell called the document \\"of huge significance\\" in exposing \\"the hypocrisy of Blair and Bush.\\" =Fuisz Technologies Ltd.= In June 1988, Fuisz founded Chantilly, Virginia-based medical technology firm Fuisz Technologies Ltd. (FT). In December 1995 he took the company public – on the strength of Fuisz's patent for pills that would quickly dissolve in the mouth without water, the company had a successful initial public offering, and after its second offering in May 1996, its stock hit an all-time high of $31.50 per share. Fuisz secured an agreement with Johnson & Johnson to develop a rapid-dissolve version of Tylenol, and thanks to his patents on \\"taste making\\" technologies that gave drugs more desirable flavors, Fuisz negotiated deals with SmithKline, Beecham, and Bayer for development of new versions of their over-the-counter products, as well as with Astra, Pfizer, and Merck for modified versions of certain prescription drugs. FT also agreed to develop food products for British Sugar, ConAgra, General Mills, and Hershey Foods, among others. Despite these lucrative arrangements, aggressive short-sellers began spreading rumors that Fuisz was being imprisoned by the FBI while being investigated by the IRS, and that his pills were so fragile they would disintegrate in shipping; by early 1997, the company's stock had plummeted to $5.62. At around the same time, Fuisz resigned as CEO and hired Ken McVey, previously of Irish biotechnology firm Élan Corp., to replace him – though Fuisz retained 21% of the stock and his position as chairman of the company's board. In January 1998, FT announced that it was selling its online drugstore to Richard Fuisz himself for $2.4 million, even though the business was worth only $50,000 on total sales of $60/month; Fuisz later claimed the purchase was a \\"white-knight act\\" performed in the interests of his shareholders. The next month, Fuisz Technologies sued Élan, accusing its rival of stealing trade secrets and of reneging on a prior manufacturing deal with FT. Fuisz also personally sued Élan for breach of contract – Fuisz had reached a hand-shake agreement to sell his 4.2 million shares in FT to Élan for about $70 million in Élan stock, which Élan refused to honor, but only after completing an audit through which they acquired confidential documents describing FT's proprietary technology and corporate strategy. News of the suit drove the company's share price from a high of $15.62 to $6.12, thanks to the significant shortfalls caused by Élan's refusal to manufacture FT products. In May, Fuisz threatened to fire McVey unless he resigned, blaming McVey's \\"bad management\\" for the company's struggles; McVey complied, Fuisz became acting CEO, and the stock fell again to $4. In April 1999, the lawsuit was settled; in addition to purchasing an unspecified number of shares in FT from Fuisz, Élan finally agreed to a licensing and manufacturing agreement in which they would produce 1.2 billion tablet doses/year of FT products at their facility in Athlone, Ireland. In July, Canadian drug firm Biovail purchased 49% of outstanding Fuisz Technologies common stock at $7/share, making FT a wholly owned subsidiary of Biovail. By September, McVey, then living in a hotel in the Channel Islands, had filed two complaints of securities fraud with the Securities and Exchange Commission: first, to investigate whether Fuisz had knowingly and wilfully stolen assets from FT through his purchase of the online drugstore, and second, to investigate Patrick Scrivens, the firm's chief financial officer and former CIA public accountant, who had sold all his FT stock at $15/share immediately before its big fall, and became CFO of the online drugstore upon his resignation. 2000s =Lockerbie bombing case= In 1994, Fuisz was introduced to Susan Lindauer, then a congressional aide to House Representative Ron Wyden, through their mutual contact Paul Hoven, an Army veteran who led a weapons procurement watchdog group, and was connected to the CIA during the Iran–Contra affair. In 1998, Lindauer submitted an affidavit to the United Nations claiming that she had met with 'a former intelligence operative,' naming Fuisz as her source, who disclosed that the Libyan government was wrongly accused of involvement in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing – she alleged that Fuisz had enlisted her help because he was being harassed by the IRS in retaliation for blowing the whistle on U.S. arms transfers to Iraq during the Gulf War. Although it was initially reported in various international media that a state secrets gag order barred Fuisz from speaking about Lindauer's statement, documents released in December 2013 by a member of Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi's legal team show this to be only partially true. In May 2000, Megrahi's lawyer Eddie MacKechnie wrote to Department of Justice Lockerbie prosecutor Brian Murtagh to determine whether Fuisz was indeed barred from testifying; Murtagh replied that although Fuisz was still subject to a gag order related to the Terex libel suit, he was free to speak openly about the Pan Am bombing. Fuisz insisted that this was not true, that he was subject to a \\"statutory obligation of secrecy\\" independent of the Terex litigation, and that he had been specifically advised by Murtagh and another DOJ lawyer to remain silent about Lockerbie. In September, MacKechnie asked Murtagh whether President Bill Clinton or CIA Director George Tenet could personally release Fuisz from his gag order; CIA general counsel Robert Eatinger replied with a letter to Murtagh reaffirming that no court order prohibited Fuisz's testimony. The next day, Fuisz called Eatinger's office seeking clarification of the letter – according to Eatinger, Fuisz described multiple briefings from CIA officers between 1988 and 1989 about various \\"security matters,\\" in particular that Ahmed Jibril of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) was the primary suspect in the Lockerbie case; Eatinger responded that Fuisz was free to discuss the security briefings he received, but he was prohibited from revealing the identities of the CIA officers or discussing the purpose for which he received the briefings. Fuisz was deposed first in December 2000, in the presence of a DOJ lawyer and two unnamed CIA officials, and again in January 2001, with three anonymous CIA officials presiding – although U.S. Attorney Anthony Coppolino invoked the state secrets privilege whenever the line of questioning approached details of Fuisz's relationship to the CIA, Fuisz confirmed that he had received multiple briefings from CIA agents in 1989 in which they informed him, inter alia, that the PFLP-GC was responsible for the bombings; he further claimed that between 1990 and 1995 he was told separately by 10–15 high level Syrian officials, who were in regular contact with Ahmed Jibril, that the Palestinian group was to blame, though he was prohibited from clarifying the nature of his relationship to these officials. In spite of Fuisz's testimony, Megrahi was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Scottish Court in the Netherlands in January 2001. =Susan Lindauer and 9/11= After their initial introduction in 1994, Fuisz and Lindauer continued to meet weekly to discuss her diplomatic contacts in the Middle East, specifically her work related to the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Libya and Iraq. In 2000, the Sunday Herald acquired the text of Lindauer's 1998 affidavit – in it, she claimed that Fuisz had infiltrated a network of Syrian terrorists tied to Iranian Hezbollah who were holding Americans hostage in Beirut, and that he was \\"first on the ground\\" in the investigation of the Lockerbie bombing because of his extensive contacts in Syria, but the CIA was destroying his reports instead of submitting them to investigators. In May of that year, the Herald published an article alleging that Fuisz was the CIA Station Chief in Damascus during the 1980s; when asked to comment on the Herald's claim and on his relationship to the CIA more generally, Fuisz remarked that \\"This is not an issue I can confirm or deny. I am not allowed to speak about these issues. In fact, I can't even explain why I can't speak about these issues.\\" Fuisz's meetings with Lindauer ended abruptly on September 11, 2001, due to what Fuisz described as an increasingly \\"seditious bent\\" to her discussions. =Kosmos Pharma and Fuisz LLC= In 2000, the same year he was named to the board of directors of Bradley Pharmaceuticals, Fuisz founded International Fluidics, another firm dedicated primarily to oral drug delivery systems; its name was changed to Kosmos Pharma in 2002. In order to acquire Fuisz's patents covering oral film strip technology, 'postage stamps' that dissolve instantly on the tongue, Kosmos was purchased by Monosol LLC in 2004, and Fuisz's son Joseph was named Monosol's senior Vice President. Meanwhile, Fuisz continued to develop and secure patents through his family- owned private company, Fuisz LLC; in addition to health care innovations such as vaginal drug delivery, thin-film-based smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes, and systems for monitoring addictive drug compliance, Fuisz LLC also holds patents on wristwatches protected by encryption, computer vision (including face and object recognition) and e-commerce, among other diverse technological fields. =Richard Fuisz and Theranos= In 2011, the blood testing company, Theranos and its CEO Elizabeth Holmes sued Dr. Richard Fuisz and his sons, alleging that Fuisz had misappropriated a Theranos patent and used that information to file his own medical analyzer patent.Beth Mole, \\"Beyond business: Disgraced Theranos bloodied family, friends, neighbors\\", arstechnica.com, November 23, 2016. Theranos and Holmes were represented in the lawsuit by famed litigator David Boies.

Most mine train roller coasters are themed in the style of a mine, a Western scene, or simply a mountain range. Traditional mine train roller coaster track elements include several banked turns and helices. There are sometimes level straightaway sections, but few large drops. Most include more than one lift hill. Often, a mine train roller coaster will make its way through trees, tunnels, rock formations, and over small bodies of water. Some feature scenes with animatronic figures. The first mine train roller coaster of its kind was Runaway Mine Train (Run-A-Way Mine Train until 1995) at Six Flags Over Texas. Built by Arrow Development in 1966, Mine Train is the oldest roller coaster in the park. With Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland (built in 1959 also by Arrow), it is one of the first roller coasters with tubular steel tracks.

A graduate of Central St. Martins College of Art and Design and Goldsmiths, University of London, she works across mediums from Jacquard woven tapestries to sculptures and robotics. Macuga is known for taking on the role of a curator and archivist within her practice, as her installations often incorporate other artists’ work alongside a variety of disparate objects.\\"Art Now.

Macuga's work is commonly made for the specific institution in which it will be shown, her place-based installations involve many months worth of historical research and have been considered rich storytelling devices. Goshka Macuga, Pies In 2009 Macuga had an exhibition at the newly re-opened Whitechapel Gallery in London wherein she incorporated a 1955 tapestry version of Picasso’s 1937 antiwar painting Guernica into a year-long installation about the 1930s-era controversy generated by the original painting. After 24 years on display just outside the Security Council at the Headquarters of the United Nations, the tapestry commissioned by Nelson Rockefeller was removed and loaned to Whitechapel for Macuga's installation.Eve M. Kahn (March 11, 2009), Woven ‘Guernica’ Departs U.N. for London New York Times.Pam Kent (April 21, 2009), After an Expansion, the Whitechapel Gallery Reopens New York Times. Along with the borrowed tapestry, Macuga made a bronze cubist sculpture of Colin Powell, a documentary film, sourced a handwoven Middle Eastern rug, and installed a conference table. As part of the installation, Macuga invited groups to hold meetings in the space free of charge. While in residence at the Walker Art Center in 2010-11, Macuga produced work for her first solo show in the United States that would investigate the cultural and political context of the Walker Art Center itself. Culminating in the exhibition, It Broke From Within, Macuga investigated the history of the shaping of the Walker Art Center as an institution through its archives. The exhibition explored the political orientation, community theory, lumber, financial history, and serendipity of clerical errors concerning the Walker. Macuga designed enormous woven tapestries of photographs taken in Minnesotas oldest pine forests and used the textile as a backdrop for select pieces from the Walker's permanent collection, including works from Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Beuys. In 2012 Macuga created a two large photorealistic tapestries for dOCUMENTA (13), one was displayed in Kassel, Germany and its counterpart in Kabul, Afghanistan. The two-part work called Of what is, that it is; of what is not, that it is not is to be exhibited simultaneously but never together in the same place. Part 1 depicts a diverse crowd of Afghans and Westerners in front of Darul Aman Palace outside of Kabul, Afghanistan. Part 2, originally exhibited in Kabul, shows a photoshopped collage of an art-world crowd and protesters gathering outside of the Orangerie in Kassel.Goshka Macuga: Of what is, that it is; of what is not, that it is not, 2, December 13, 2012 – January 13, 2013 Smart Museum of Art, Chicago.

He played in the First Division of the Football League and in European competition for Birmingham City, and in the Football League for Norwich City, Doncaster Rovers, Watford and Lincoln City. Biography Larkin was born in Digbeth, Birmingham. He joined local club Birmingham City as a 16-year-old wing half, signing professional forms at 18. He made his debut at inside left in October 1956, when he was nearly 21; the club had a big squad in those days, and it was not unusual for a player to be well into his twenties before getting into the first team on a regular basis. :\\"When I joined the club the staff was bigger than is normal nowadays. We even had pros playing for the fifth team and by the time you reached the 'A' team there were some very good players indeed.\\"Bunny Larkin quoted in He scored on debut, but still only played another six games that season.Matthews, p. 192. He played more frequently the following season, filling in at right-half for Johnny Watts. He took part in both legs of the semi-final of the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Barcelona, though he missed the replay.Matthews, p. 241. His career changed in November 1958, when he was selected at inside left in place of the ageing Peter Murphy.Matthews, p. 194. Between then and the end of the season he scored 23 goals in all competitions, including four goals in the early rounds of the 1958–60 Fairs Cup, which made him the club's top scorer for the 1958–59 season. He attributed his goalscoring success to being two-footed: :\\"I'd always scored goals wherever I'd played. I had the advantage of being able to use both feet to shoot. That meant that you didn't have to change your position when the ball came to you. There don't seem to be many players around nowadays that can do that.\\" He contributed another goal in the Fairs Cup semi- final, but by the time the final against Barcelona came round, he had lost form and left the club, transferred to Norwich City for a fee of £10,000. An incident in which he overslept and missed the flight to a European away game did not help his cause. He spent two seasons at Norwich, then went on to Doncaster Rovers, Watford, Lincoln City and to non-league clubs including Wisbech Town, Nuneaton Borough, King's Lynn and Stevenage Athletic. He had the distinction of being the first Lincoln City player ever to be substituted in the Football League. After retiring from football he settled in the Norwich area and became a salesman for a bakery firm.

In Indian philosophy, action or Karma has been divided into three categories, according to their intrinsic qualities or gunas. Here Nishkam Karma belongs to the first category, the Sattva (pure) or actions which add to calmness; the Sakam Karma (Self-centred action) comes in the second rājasika (aggression) and Vikarma (bad-action) comes under the third, tāmasika which correlates to darkness or inertia.Relaxation, a must for better mind power Times of India, July 28, 2008.

Page 296. Another aspect that differentiates it from Sakam or selfish action, is that while the former is guided by inspiration, the latter is all about motivation, and that makes the central difference in its results, for example Sakam Karma might lead to excessive work pressure and workaholism as it aims at success, and hence creates more chances of physical and psychological burn outs. On the other hand Nishkam Karma, means more balanced approach to work, and as work has been turned into a pursuit of personal excellence, which results in greater personal satisfaction, which one would have otherwise sought in job satisfaction coming from external rewards. One important fallout of the entire shift is that where one is essentially an ethical practice inside-out leading to the adage, ‘Work is worship’ show itself literally at workplace, leading to greater work commitment, the other since it is so much result oriented can lead to unethical business and professional ethics, as seen so often at modern work place Globalisation Managing Org.

Its western terminus lies at Gateway Center in downtown Pittsburgh. For its westernmost ten blocks it serves as the core of the Cultural District with such attractions as Heinz Hall, the Benedum Center and the Byham Theater as well as the David L. Lawrence Convention Center and the Heinz History Center bordering it. Exiting downtown it is the major route through the city's Strip District, Lawrenceville, Bloomfield, Garfield and East Liberty neighborhoods. Its eastern portion exits the city at Wilkinsburg where it continues to exist as Penn Avenue with a numbering system that begins anew using small numbers as it approaches Interstate 376 the \\"Parkway East\\". Penn Avenue is about long.Google Maps From downtown, Penn Avenue travels in the same general direction as the Allegheny River, thus it passes close by a number of the bridges of the city that cross that river. In the downtown area, Penn Avenue is the main bisecting street of the Three Sister Bridges that form the Roberto Clemente Bridge, Andy Warhol Bridge and Rachel Carson Bridge. It passes the 16th Street Bridge, and goes straight through the Strip District. History Before being named Penn Avenue it was known as the Great Road, being perhaps the only road leading from east of the Allegheny Mountains to the headwaters of the Ohio River. It may have been known as the Great Road when George Washington traveled it, in 1753.Wilkinsburg Historical Society (2007) Wilkinsburg, Arcadia Publishing, 7 In the 18th century, settlers entered the area from the eastern part of Pennsylvania via a road which came to be called the Greensburg Pike early in the 19th century. The road passed through a tiny settlement which grew to become Greensburg, Pa. In Pittsburgh, Greensburg Pike became Penn Avenue, therefore, Penn Avenue is the oldest and most historically-significant street in Pittsburgh. Bike infrastructure In early 2014, the City of Pittsburgh announced the installation of the first set of protected bike lanes in the area.

The refugees were fleeing Spain after Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). The Chilean President Pedro Aguirre Cerda had named the poet Pablo Neruda Special Consul in Paris for Immigration, and he was charged with what he called \\"the noblest mission I have ever undertaken\\": shipping the Spanish refugees, who had been housed by the French government in internment camps, to Chile.Winnipeg, el poema que cruzó el Atlántico  History  After the end of the Spanish Civil War, Pablo Neruda noticed that many Spanish Republicans had fled in exile to France where they were detained in squalid camps in miserable conditions. The poet, who was then living in Chile, decided to organize their travel to Chile. He first worked as Chilean consul in Spain, before being named consul in Paris. The ship was an old French cargo ship which ordinarily could not take more than 2000 persons,SS Winnipeg but it was adapted so it could carry the 2,200 refugees. Neruda actively worked in this endeavour, reuniting families separated by the war. Beside the assistance of his friends artists and writers, he was helped by his wife . On the night when Winnipeg set sail, on 4 August 1939, in the port of Trompeloup - Pauillac, Pablo Neruda wrote: Winnipeg arrived at the port of Valparaíso on 3 September 1939. On the following day, the Spanish Republicans were officially received by the Chilean authorities. Some of them had already landed, a few days before, in the port of Arica, in northern Chile. In a gesture of gratitude, the refugees attached to the ship's mast a large canvas with the face of the Chilean president painted on it. Most of the immigrants who landed in Chile stayed there. Among them were the historian Leopoldo Castedo, the typographer Mauricio Amster and the painters Roser Bru and José Balmes.Spanish: \\"Nunca jamás, ni siquiera al final de mi vida voy a hacer lo suficiente por agradecer el hecho de estar en este país y de ser ciudadano chileno, gracias justamente a Pablo Neruda. Como alguien dijo alguna vez 'las deudas de amor no se terminan de pagar nunca' y esta es una gran deuda que yo tengo con él todavía\\".

The first version of Logic Studio was unveiled on September 12, 2007. It claims to be the largest collection of modeled instruments, sampler instruments, effect plug-ins, and audio loops ever put in a single application.What is Logic Studio? Retrieved on April 9, 2011 The package contains Logic Pro, Mainstage, Soundtrack Pro, WaveBurner, Studio Instruments, Studio Effects, Apple Loops, Apple Loops Utility, Impulse Response Utility, Compressor, and QuickTime Pro. It also contains 6 content DVDs containing Jam Pack collections, sound effects, surround music beds, EXS24 samples, and impulse response files and a demo content DVD.Apple Logic Studio Technical Specifications Retrieved on April 9, 2011 On December 8, 2011, it was announced that the boxed version of Logic Studio suite would be discontinued. Instead, Logic Pro and Mainstage would be sold separately on the Mac App Store. Soundtrack Pro was discontinued as part of the move.Logic Pro comes to Mac App Store, Logic Express dropped in the shuffle Retrieved on November 8, 2014 Components = Apple Loops Utility = The Apple Loops Utility software is a small companion utility to Soundtrack Pro, GarageBand, Logic Express, and Logic Pro, all made by Apple Inc. Apple Loops Utility allows users to create loops of audio that can be time-stretched. Audio files converted to \\"Apple Loops\\" via the Apple Loops Utility can also be tagged with their publishing (Author, Comments, etc.) and musical information (Key, Tempo, etc.). Multiple files can be tagged at the same time, a process known as batch tagging. Apple Loops Utility can read both AIFF and WAV file formats, but it will convert the latter to AIFF when saved with tagging information. = Compressor = Compressor is a video and audio media compression and encoding application for use with Final Cut Studio and Logic Studio on Mac OS X. It can be used with Qmaster for clustering. Compressor is used for encoding MPEG-1, MPEG-2 for DVD, QuickTime .mov, MPEG-4 (Simple Profile), MPEG-4 H.264 and optional (third Party and often commercial) QuickTime Exporter Components to export to Windows Media, for example. Among its other features is the ability to convert from NTSC to PAL and vice versa, and the ability to 'upconvert' from Standard Definition video to High Definition video with feature detail detection to prevent serious quality losses. = Impulse Response Utility = The Impulse Response Utility is used to create custom convolution reverbs. = Logic Pro = Logic Pro is a hybrid 32 / 64 bit digital audio workstation and MIDI sequencer software application for the Mac OS X platform. Originally created by German software developer Emagic, Logic Pro became an Apple product when Apple bought Emagic in 2002. Logic Pro provides software instruments, synthesizers, audio effects and recording facilities for music synthesis. It also supports Apple Loops - royalty-free professionally recorded instrument loops. Audio effects include distortions, dynamics processors, equalization filters, and delays. The Space Designer plugin simulates the acoustics of audio played in different environments, such as rooms of varying size, or producing the echoes that might be heard on high mountains. Logic Pro can work with MIDI keyboards and control surfaces for input and processing, and for MIDI output. It features real-time scoring in musical notation, supporting guitar tablature, chord abbreviations and drum notation. The application features distributed processing abilities, which can function across an Ethernet LAN. One machine runs the Logic Pro app, while the other machines on the network run the Logic node app. Logic will then offload the effects and synth processing to the other machines on the network. If the network is fast enough (i.e. gigabit Ethernet) this can work in near-real time, depending on buffer settings and CPU loads. This allows users to combine the power of several Mac computers to process Logic Pro’s built-in software instruments and plug-ins, and 3rd party processing plug-ins. = MainStage = MainStage's primary purpose is to serve as a method of centralizing any virtual instruments that users might have installed on their computers that are normally used in Apple's DAW software Logic Pro for use in live performance. The instruments can then be played using a pre-recorded MIDI file or via a MIDI controller such as a keyboard. MainStage's other features include the ability to play back pre-recorded backing tracks and to function as a guitar and vocal multi-effects processor. The second version, MainStage 2, was released on July 23, 2009, along with updated releases of many of the other applications in the Logic Studio package. = Soundtrack Pro = Soundtrack Pro is a music composing and audio editing application made by Apple Inc., which includes a collection of just over 5000 royalty free professional instrument loops and sound effects. The program also allows multitrack projects to be exported directly with Compressor settings. = Waveburner = WaveBurner can be used for assembling, mastering, and burning audio CDs. Audio CDs created with WaveBurner can be played back on any audio CD player, and can be used as premasters to produce CDs in large numbers for possible distribution. WaveBurner has several notable features: *Allows for up to 99 tracks and 99 subindexes per track *Includes ISRC codes for each track *Includes copy prevention and pre-emphasis for each track *Adds UPC/EAN codes for the CD *Supports CD-Text *Create DDP (CD-image) System requirements According to Apple, one needs to meet the following requirements to install all applications: *Mac computer with an Intel processor (PPC is supported prior to v9.1.11) *2GB of RAM (4GB or more recommended) *Display with 1280x768 or higher resolution *Mac OS X v10.6.8 or later *QuickTime 7.6 or later *DVD drive for installation *9GB to install all applications and required content **Additional 38GB to install all optional content (large content packages can be installed on separate disk): ***10GB for Jam Pack collections ***16GB for sound effects ***6GB for surround music beds ***6GB for other optional content See also * Logic Express * Logic Pro * Logic Control * Audio Units * Core Audio * GarageBand * Comparison of multitrack recording software References Digital audio workstation software Software synthesizers MacOS-only software made by Apple Inc.

The ninth named storm and third hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Humberto developed on September 12, 2007, in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico,. The tropical cyclone rapidly strengthened and struck High Island, Texas, with winds of about 90 mph (150 km/h) early on September 13. It steadily weakened after moving ashore, and on September 14, Humberto began dissipating over northwestern Georgia as it interacted with an approaching cold front. Damage was fairly light, estimated at approximately $50 million (2007 USD). Precipitation peaked at 14.13 inches (358.9 mm), while wind gusts to 85 mph (137 km/h) were reported. The heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, which damaged or destroyed dozens of homes, and closed several highways. Trees and power lines were downed, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of customers. The hurricane caused one fatality in the State of Texas. Additionally, as the storm progressed inland, rainfall was reported throughout the Southeast United States. Meteorological history The origins of Humberto can be traced to the remnants of a frontal trough—the same one that spawned Tropical Storm Gabrielle—that moved offshore of south Florida on September 5. The combination of a weak surface trough and an upper- level low pressure system produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms from western Cuba into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Tracking slowly west- northwestward, unfavorable wind shear initially inhibited tropical cyclone development. By late on September 11, environmental conditions became more favorable, and the following morning convection increased over the disturbance. Tracking around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge, the system turned on a slow northwest drift and quickly organized. Radar imagery reported loose banding features, and buoy data indicated the presence of a surface circulation; based on the observations, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Depression Nine, while located roughly 60 miles (100 km) southeast of Matagorda, Texas. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the tropical depression was forecast to strengthen slowly to reach peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Within three hours of forming, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto. A small cyclone, the storm continued to organize quickly as it turned north-northeastward, while radar imagery suggested the formation of an eye by early on September 13. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 0515 UTC on September 13, while located about 15 miles (20 km) off the coast of Texas. The hurricane made landfall a few miles to the east of High Island at around 0700 UTC. A well-defined eye was maintained with strong convection around it, and Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) about two hours after landfall. However, post-storm analysis later determined that the winds were a bit stronger—about 90 mph (150 km/h). Based on operational estimates of a wind speed increase of 50 mph (85 km/h), the National Hurricane Center reported that \\"no tropical cyclone in the historic record has ever reached this intensity at a faster rate near landfall.\\" The path of the eye continued northeastward and passed over Port Arthur, Nederland, Port Neches, Groves, and Bridge City, Texas at Category 1 hurricane strength. This was the second time within two years (following Hurricane Rita on September 24, 2005) that these cities experienced a direct hit from a hurricane. By eight hours after landfall, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed into southwestern Louisiana. Increased upper-level wind shear caused the storm to weaken rapidly over land, and late on September 13 Humberto weakened to a tropical depression. Upon issuing its last advisory, the National Hurricane Center remarked on the potential for the remnants of the storm to turn southward into the Gulf of Mexico. However, the storm continued northeastward through the southeastern United States, and on September 14, the storm began dissipating over northwestern Georgia, and shortly thereafter degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. Preparations Radar image of Hurricane Humberto at Texas landfall Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, a tropical storm warning was issued from Port O'Connor, Texas, to Cameron, Louisiana, and a tropical storm watch was posted from Cameron to Intracoastal City, Louisiana; after Humberto became a tropical storm, the watch was upgraded to a warning. Upon reaching hurricane status, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from High Island, Texas, to Cameron, Louisiana. An inland tropical storm warning was declared for several parishes in southwestern Louisiana. The National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center posted a tornado watch for southwestern coastal parishes. Prior to moving ashore, officials in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, advised residents in low-lying or flood-prone areas to consider moving to a safer location. A shelter was opened in Lake Charles, where 29 people stayed during the storm. Flood watches and warnings were issued for portions of Mississippi and Louisiana as the storm tracked across the region. Texas Governor Rick Perry, prepared state resources for the potentially impacted areas, including the deployment of 200 Texas Military Forces soldiers and six Black Hawk helicopters and two water rescue teams for search and rescue missions. The Texas State Operations Center was activated shortly after the cyclone developed. Impact =Texas= Fallen trees like this one caused many power outages in Southeast Texas A few hours prior to its development, outer rainbands from the depression began moving over portions of the Texas coast. Heavy rainfall from intense thunderstorms caused minor flooding as they crossed the coastline during the subsequent days; precipitation in the state peaked at 14.13 inches (358.9 mm) at East Bay Bayou, the highest recorded rainfall total in association with the hurricane. Sustained winds peaked at 69 mph (112 km/h) with gusts to 85 mph (137 km/h) at Sea Rim State Park; the National Weather Service estimates gusts exceeded 90 mph (145 km/h) in southwestern Jefferson County and extreme southeastern Chambers County. In the Golden Pass Ship Channel, an unofficial report of a 115 mph (185 km/h) wind gust was relayed to the National Hurricane Center. Upon moving ashore, Humberto produced a minor storm surge in the state, peaking at 2.86 feet (0.87 m) at Rollover Pass; the combination of surge and waves resulted in light beach erosion. Hurricane Humberto left 10 homes completely destroyed in Galveston County, with an additional 19 severely damaged in the county; several homes received minor shingle damage, and road closures left about 5,000 houses isolated in the county. The combination of saturated grounds and strong winds uprooted many trees and downed power lines across the path of the hurricane, with at least 50 high voltage transmission poles blown down or seriously damaged; over 120,000 power customers in Orange and Jefferson counties lost power, with 118,000 Entergy customers in the state without electricity. Widespread flooding occurred in Jefferson and Orange counties, and at least 20 homes in Beaumont were flooded. Additionally, several roadways were flooded. The passage of the hurricane caused one fatality in the state; a Bridge City man was killed when his carport crashed on him outside his house. Initially, press reports indicated that the storm wrought up to $500 million in damage; however, final damage estimates were about $50 million. Oil production was slowed as a result of Humberto, as at least four refineries—the Valero, ExxonMobil, Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC plants in Port Arthur—were halted due to the loss of power. Oil prices rose above $80 a barrel in intraday trading on September 12 as a result, ending the next day at a record high of $80.09 a barrel. Natural gas futures rose 8 percent ahead of the storm, but lost most of those gains the next day. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 1,464 residences throughout Texas were affected by Hurricane Humberto. Of these, 25 were destroyed, 96 sustained major damage and 240 sustained minor damage. The cost of individual assistance for those impacted by Humberto would cost $4,776,334; the cost of debris removal and other public assistance amounted to $6,682,074. In terms of per capita income, Jefferson County sustained the most impact, decreasing by $22.38. =Louisiana= Humberto's rainfall Tracking through the state as a weakening tropical storm, Humberto produced light to moderate winds across southwestern Louisiana. Gusts officially peaked at 43 mph (69 km/h) in the state, although an unofficial reading of 55 mph (89 km/h) was reported in Vinton. Heavy rainfall occurred across the area, reaching a peak of 8.25 inches (210 mm) in DeRidder. The rainfall triggered minor river flooding along the Vermilion River in Lafayette. Storm surge was minor in the state, peaking at 2.13 feet (0.65 m) in Cypremont Point; no beach erosion was reported. Widespread freshwater flooding occurred in Beauregard Parish, leaving homes in DeRidder flooded. High water across the southwestern portion of the state resulted in the closure of several roadways, including U.S. Route 171 and various state highways. Isolated wind damage was reported, particularly near the Texas border, with some trees and power lines blown down. A total of about 13,000 power customers lost electricity in southwestern Louisiana. One F1 tornado briefly touched down in Vermilion Parish, blowing the roof off one home and downing trees and power lines. Damage throughout Louisiana was estimated at $525,000. =Southeast United States= After the circulation dissipated, the remnants of Humberto brought moderate rainfall to the southeastern states and spawned several tornadoes across portions of South Carolina and North Carolina and caused widespread damage in some locations. Heavy rains in Mississippi led to flooding in low-lying areas. In Hinds County, a small rail bridge was washed out, forcing all Amtrak train passengers to take a bus to their destinations. One person was injured after driving his car into a flooded street. In Alabama, rainfall up to caused minor ponding in low-lying areas but aided in short-term drought relief. In northern Georgia, locally heavy rainfall led to flash flooding, resulting in several road closures. Strong thunderstorms associated with the remnants of Humberto also produced winds up to and penny-sized hail. Throughout North Carolina, ten F0 tornadoes were confirmed, resulting in minor damage to homes, though none caused injuries or fatalities. Heavy rains associated with the system also triggered flash flooding along some roads, resulting in their closure. In South Carolina, one F1 tornado touched down in Laurens County, causing moderate damage to several homes before lifting. Aftermath Residents lining up at a damaged gas station for fuel and supplies in the wake of Humberto Hours after Humberto made landfall, Rick Perry declared Galveston, Jefferson, and Orange counties as disaster areas, which allocated state resources to assist the affected residents. The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21. Four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three most affected counties. Following their assessment, they determined that the damage caused by Humberto was not significant enough to require a disaster declaration. As such, Governor Rick Perry's request from FEMA was denied. Across the Bolivar Peninsula, an estimated 1,500 cubic yards of structural debris and 3,000 cubic yards of tree limbs were needed to be removed in the wake of the storm.

Because of his interest in mysticism he was known as the Mystic Doctor. Early life Heylyn was the son of John Heylyn, a saddler of London, and his wife Susanna Sherman. The Heylyn family originally came from North Wales. He was born in Westminster and entered Westminster School in 1700. He was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge on 7 June 1705 and was elected scholar of Trinity. In 1708 he graduated BA. He was ordained priest at London on 18 December 1709. It was recorded by Edward Rud in his 'Diary' that Heylyn \\"preach'd a very fine sermon\\" at the archidiaconal visitation of Dr Bewley in December 1710.Rud, E., The diary (1709-1727) of Edward Rud, sometime fellow of Trinity college, and rector of North Runcton in Norfolk; to which are added several unpublished letters of Dr. Bentley, accessed 31 August 2019 A 19th century print showing St Mary-le-Strand and the Strand front of Somerset House.

He was awarded MA in 1714. In 1719 he left Haslingfield and served in various parishes in London, where he lived at Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, and Queen Street, Westminster, among other places. In 1724 he became the first rector of the rebuilt St Mary-le-Strand, London. In the summer of 1725 he took his family to Geneva, where he left his sons to learn French. In the following year his second son Charles was drowned in the River Rhône in the rapid water where it runs out of Lake Geneva. Heylyn gained a Doctor of Divinity in 1728. He became chaplain in ordinary to George II. In 1729 he was chosen Lecturer of All Hallows Lombard Street. He published many theological works and from his indulgence in mysticism was known as the Mystic Doctor. Heylyn was an influence on John Wesley as early as the Oxford Methodist days. According to Wesley’s diaries, on 10 May 1738 (Whitsunday), Wesley heard Heylyn \\"preach a truly Christian sermon on 'They were all filled with the Holy Ghost'--and so, said he, may all of you be.\\" In 1739 Wesley heard Heylyn give a sermon on feigned and hypocritical repentance, and as a result, declared that he (Wesley) had been a hypocrite for twenty years. Heylyn’s “Theological Lectures” was used as a source in Wesley's compilation of the Explanatory Notes on the New Testament. He served as vicar of Sunbury on Thames, Middlesex 1742–7, a prebendary of St Pauls Cathedral. In 1743 Heylyn was installed prebendary of Westminster Abbey. Heylyn died at Hampstead at the age of 74 and was buried in Westminster Abbey in August 1759. Family Heylyn was married twice. He married the daughter of Dr Herbert Masters physician at Cirencester. She died in about 1718 and was buried in Covent Garden Churchyard. Heylyn had one surviving son John by his first wife who became a merchant of Bristol. His second wife was Elizabeth Ebutt, the daughter of Mrs Elizabeth Ebbutt of St. Margaret's Westminster. She died on 9 June 1747, aged 49. Heylyn had a daughter Elizabeth by his second wife.

Business career Although D.A. Gordon had a successful regional and national political career he is known locally as the \\"Father of Modern Wallaceburg\\". He was most likely given this title for his work in establishing four of Wallaceburg’s most successful industries: Wallaceburg Cooperage Company (1887), Sydenham Glass Company (1894), Canada and Dominion Sugar Company (1901), and the Wallaceburg Brass & Iron Limited Company (1905).

It belongs to the genus Surniculus along with the Asian drongo-cuckoo (S. lugubris). The two were previously classified as a single species but are now often separated based on differences in calls and juvenile plumage. It is long. The black bill is slender and curved and the tail is fairly long and slightly forked. The plumage is mostly glossy blue- black apart from a white bar on the underwing and white marks on the thigh feathers and on the underside of the tail. Young birds are duller than the adults but otherwise similar unlike young Asian drongo-cuckoos which are spotted white. The call is a repeated series of 8 or 9 ascending notes. It inhabits the canopy and middle storey of lowland forest. It is usually shy and solitary. There are two subspecies: S. v. velutinus on Mindanao, Samar, Leyte, Bohol and the Sulu Archipelago and S. v. chalybaeus on Luzon, Mindanao and Negros. On Palawan, the species is replaced by Asian drongo-cuckoos of the race minimus. Little is known about its breeding habits. It is likely to be a brood parasite laying its eggs in the nests of other birds but its host species are unknown.

They are located in the Kara Sea, about 30 km north of the western coast of the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia, Russia.  Etymology  The Mona Islands were named by Fridtjof Nansen after Henrik Mohn, a Norwegian meteorologist. Mohn worked out and published the meteorological observations of various polar expeditions, including those of Nansen in the \\"Fram\\" (1893-6). \\"Mona\\" is a genitive case in Russian, meaning \\"(islands) of Mon\\" and this name has stuck, especially since the Germans used (\\"Mona Inseln\\"), based on the Russian version of the name, during their campaigns in World War II. Since then \\"Mona Islands\\" has become popular and its use has been widespread in this manner for many decades and in many modern maps and atlases.  Islands  Kravkov Island Kravkov Island (Остров Кравкова) is one of the biggest islands, but it is still only about 3 km square. Named in 1933 after Soviet hydrographer Sergey Nikolaievich Kravkov (1894-1942). Gerkules Island Small Gerkules Island (Остров Геркулес), located in the middle of the group, is named after lost explorer Vladimir Rusanov's ship. Ringnes Island Ringnes Island (Остров Рингнес) located at the western end of the group, was named after the Norwegian Ringnes brewery that financed Otto Sverdrup's Arctic expeditions. Other islands Other islands are called Granitnyy (Остров Гранитный) and Krainiy (Остров Крайний).  Geography  This island group belongs to the Krasnoyarsk Krai administrative division of the Russian Federation. The sea surrounding the Mona Islands is covered with pack ice in the winter, which is long and bitter. There are numerous ice floes even in the summer. History Memorial plaque commemorating Vladimir Rusanov's expedition which was lost in this area of the Kara Sea. This plaque is located in Gerkules Island, which is named after Rusanov's ship. Russian scholars deem that Vladimir Rusanov and his ill-fated party disappeared somewhere around the area of the Mona Islands. Relics were found in 1934 in Gerkules Island, including a wooden pole with the inscription \\"Gerkules 1913\\", broken old sledges and a fragment of a cartridge box. Other remainders were found in Popova Chukchina, an island of another group not far away (Kolosovykh Islands) during and expedition organized in 1937 by the Arctic Institute of the Soviet Union. During the Second World War there was much activity near these lonely islands. Kriegsmarine heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer, under Commander Wilhelm Meendsen-Bohlken, destroyers Friedrich Eckoldt, Erich Steinbrinck and Richard Beitzen, entered the Kara Sea along with submarines (Captain Grau) and (Lt. Captain Timm) in August 1942, in order to destroy Soviet warships. The Germans knew that many ships of the USSR fleet had sought refuge in the Kara Sea because of the protection that its icy pack provided during ten months in a year. The large-scale naval operation in order to enter the Kara Sea and destroy as many Russian vessels as possible was named Operation Wunderland. Since May 1993 the Mona Islands are part of the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve of Russia.

The purpose of denunciation is not so much to punish the offender but to demonstrate to law-abiding citizens that the particular behaviour which is being punished, or denounced, is not acceptable.Ronald J. Rychlak. Society's Moral Right to Punish: A Further Exploration of the Denunciation Theory of Punishment, Tulane Law Review, Vol. 65, No. 2, 1990. In this respect, it has been argued that \\"punishment is not like a private letter; it is like a billboard put up on a busy street… it is also meant for the victim of crime and for the public at large’.Bill Wringe. Rethinking expressive theories of punishment: why denunciation is a better bet than communication or pure expression. Bilkent University, 06800 Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey, June 2016, p.5. Denunciation is one of five different objectives that punishment is thought to achieve; the other four objectives are deterrence, incapacitation (for the protection of society), retribution and rehabilitation.  Theories  = Instrumental denunciation = Durkheim (1960) argued that denunciation was a form of education in that punishment \\"reinforce(s) the conscience collective of society and thereby ensure(s) that members of society continued to refrain from crime\\". This is a forward looking or utilitarian approach which is similar to the concept of deterrence.Cavadino, Justifying Punishment, p 46-48. = Expressive denunciation = This view of denunciation is that punishment is justified because it expresses society's abhorrence of crime and shows the commitment of a particular society to its own values. This perspective does not 'look forward' as it does not include an intention to change or affect anyone's behaviour.Cavadino, Justifying Punishment, p 46-48. = Communicative theory of punishment = Antony Duff (1986) claims that punishment is \\"an attempt at moral dialogue with offenders, censuring their actions and hoping to secure their ‘contrition’, with the result that they mend their ways.\\" Cavadino says this view 'resembles denunciation' but also contains elements of reform and reintegrative shaming.Cavadino, Justifying Punishment, p 48.  Legislative applications  Some jurisdictions include 'denunciation' as a sentencing purpose in their legislation. For instance, The Canadian Criminal Code describes the principles and purpose of sentencing in section 718. One of those purposes is denunciation, described as \\"making sure the punishment reflects society’s abhorrence for the crime committed\\".Purpose and Principles of Sentencing in Canada In New Zealand, section 7 of the Sentencing Act 2002 describes eight different purposes of sentencing for 'dealing with offenders'. The purpose under section 7(a) is \\"to hold the offender accountable for harm done to the victim and the community by the offending and 7(e) is \\"to denounce the conduct in which the offender was involved.\\"Purposes of sentencing or otherwise dealing with offenders, Sentencing Act 2002  Effectiveness  Cavadino says research indicates that citizens generally seem to have sufficient respect for the justice system to obey the laws in society and are not particularly influenced by the level of punishment imposed for particular offences - bearing in mind that people often have quite inaccurate beliefs about what the penalties are for particular offences. As a consequence, he argues that using the notion of denunciation to justify punishing offenders is a dubious mechanism to use.Cavadino, Justifying Punishment, p 47.

Throughout her childhood, Abé wrote, completing what she calls \\"The Silliest Romance Novel Ever\\" during her free time during modeling shoots. Her writing focused on romance, as those were the types of books that she most enjoyed reading. She later attended college in Los Angeles, graduating with a degree in drama. Her second novel, also a contemporary romance, took third place in a writing contest. She sent the book to several prospective agents, many of which responded with questions similar to \\"Nice voice — but what line are you writing for?\\" Unwilling to try to fit her writing into some of the rules that governed contemporary romances, Abé chose to concentrate on historical romances. For her first attempt at a historical romance, the newlywed Abé chose to tell the story of her own romance with her husband, set in medieval times. The manuscript was purchased by Bantam Books and published as A Rose in Winter. Many of Abé's subsequent novels have also been set in the medieval time period. Abé chose the time period because of its \\"great sense of dichotomy....It inspires thoughts of grandeur, of courtly grace and chivalrous knights — but at the same time there's a gritty, raw aspect to the period that just cannot be denied.\\" Abé has received the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award, and has been nominated six times for Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice Awards, winning twice.

It involves capital punishment, sending an offender to prison, or possibly restricting their freedom in the community, to protect society and prevent that person from committing further crimes. Incarceration, as the primary mechanism for incapacitation, is also used as to try to deter future offending.  Purpose  Incapacitation is used primarily to protect the public from offenders who are seen as sufficiently dangerous that they need to be 'removed' from society for a period of time, which is achieved usually by sending the offender to prison (incarceration). In most countries, prison sentences are applied for a range of different crimes but are almost certain to be applied to those who commit serious assaults, murder or sex crimes. However, the risk that offenders pose to society is largely a matter of perception. As a result, how the justice system in one country treats a particular offence will differ considerably from the level of sanction imposed for the same crime in another country. This means that some countries, like the United States, use incarceration to incapacitate offenders at much higher rates than other countries. Rates of imprisonment vary from over 650 inmates per 100,000 of population in the United States to Guinea Bissau which locks up only 10 people per 100,000.World Prison Brief  Methods  = Incarceration = Imprisonment incapacitates prisoners by physically removing them from the society against which they are deemed to have offended or potentially may endanger. Long term imprisonment with the intention to incapacitate is often used by criminal justice systems against habitual criminals who recidivate (relapse). Therefore, incapacitation focuses on removing the ability of the offenders to commit future crimes by use of imprisonment rather than focusing on rehabilitation or prevention. Within the prison system itself, inmate security classifications are used to classify prisoners based on risk level and place them in an environment that will adequately incapacitate them from causing trouble. = Community-based sentences = Incarceration is not the only means of incapacitation; supervision can also sometimes serve that purpose. Although parole and probation have long been justified as means of reintegrating offenders into the community, the trend has been for them to be increasingly perceived as cost-effective ways of imposing long-term management on the dangerous. In the federal system, the PROTECT Act, for example, allowed for lifetime federal supervised release to be imposed on sex offenders, the implication being that they will never be rehabilitated to a level of risk comparable to that of the general population. From a standpoint of seeking to incapacitate those who pose a threat to the public, if a high-risk offender goes back to prison for a non-criminal violation of his conditions of release, this is actually a success rather than a failure, because he was incapacitated before he could commit another crime and get caught for it. Unlike deterrence, rehabilitation, or restitution, incapacitation alters neither the offender nor his social context, but simply rearranges the distribution of offenders in society in such a way as to delay their resumption of crime, and thereby decrease the crime rate. According to Malcolm M. Feeley, \\"Incapacitation then is to penology what arbitrage is to investments, a method of capitalizing on minute displacements in time; and like arbitrage it has a diminished relationship to the normative goal of enhancing the value of its objects.\\" Much as an investor analyzes the risk profiles of various investment opportunities so as to make choices that will have the best return, society seeks to identify high-risk offenders and invest in their long-term incarceration. Scholarship In his 2004 article, Steven Levitt attributes part of the decline in the crime rate seen beginning in the mid-1990s to the inability of inmates to recidivate as sentences for crimes, especially for repeat offenders, had been greatly increased. Examples of these laws include back-to-back life sentences, three-strikes sentencing, and other habitual offender laws. In the United States, states that one of the purposes of criminal sentencing is to \\"protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\\". Quite simply, those incarcerated cannot commit further crimes against society. Most of the justification for the continued high levels of those in prison in the United States is due to the incapacitation effect. In the 1970s, the strong emphasis on rehabilitation that had existed since the turn of the century gave way first to a focus on equality and fairness in sentencing, and then to an increased focus on incapacitation, deterrence and restraint strategies of crime prevention.Zimring, F. E., & Hawkins, Gordon. (1995). Incapacitation: penal confinement and the restraint of crime. New York: Oxford University Press. However, the increase in the number of persons incarcerated has greatly increased due to the implementation of this concept. For the 30 years prior to 1974, the average number or persons incarcerated was 103 per 100,000. This number had climbed to 600 per 100,000 by 1995.Bureau of Justice Statistics 1995. The nation's correctional population tops 5 million. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics (NCJ-156432) As of 2013 the figure was 716 per 100,000.Roy Walmsley (November 21, 2013). World Prison Population List (tenth edition). International Centre for Prison Studies. Retrieved July 11, 2014. The effect of incapacitation often has the unintended effect of incarceration of inmates' families.Clear, T. R. (1996). The Unintended Consequences of Incarceration. Paper presented at the NIJ workshop on corrections research, Feb. 14-15 MacKenzie found that incapacitating offenders who continue to commit crimes at high rates is effective, it works best as a part of a multi-tiered approach. In addition, the effects of incarceration on the families and children of the inmate may be increasing the likelihood of future criminal activities.https://www.ncsl.org/documents/cyf/childrenofincarceratedparents.pdf In the Victorian Jury Sentencing Study, incapacitation was the second most popular predominant sentencing purpose for judges, while for jurors, it was only the fifth ranking purpose. Examples =United States= The crime rate in the United States unexpectedly fell sharply in the 1990s, in almost all demographic and geographic areas, and a portion of the drop has been attributed to the incapacitation effect. Beginning in the mid-1990s, sentences began to lengthen due to habitual felon statutes being passed in many states as well as changes in sentencing statutes which reduced the credit inmates could amass to reduce the amount of time they were held in prison. Recidivism remains a problem in the United States, where according to a 2005 Bureau of Justice Statistics rates of recidivism average around 67.5%, although this number is heavily dependent on the type of crime when applied to specific cases. The rate of recidivism has increased since the 1990s. However, the cost to incarcerate inmates continues to rise, which has led states to release inmates before the end of their assigned term, such as in North Carolina's advanced supervisory release program. The balance between the cost of incarceration and the reduction in crime due to the incapacitation effect remains difficult to make decisions on and problematic for politicians. In 2015, a similar problem was noted in North Carolina, where a court-ordered reduction in student suspensions appears to be linked in an increase in on- campus crime. =Australia= A similar drop in crime was noted in Australia, where the marked increase in the prison population was termed a \\"very blunt instrument of crime control but it is an important instrument, nonetheless.\\" The paper further states that achieving a 10 percent reduction in the 2006 burglary rate an increase imprisonment of 34 percent would be needed. Doing so would increase cost by an additional $26 million per year. Further research was recommended as to the cost-effectiveness of this method of controlling crime. =Elsewhere= Cutting off a hand of a thief is also an example; this acts to prevent further thefts in a drastic manner, in addition to it having a perceived deterrent effect on others. Controversies One criticism of incapacitation is that it focuses on predictions of dangerousness rather than on the rights of the accused. For example, incapacitation theory might advocate pretrial detention of a defendant who has not yet been proven guilty. His guilt or innocence of the particular crime he is charged with might have limited relevance to the issue of whether his pretrial detention would serve the goal of protecting the public from future crimes he might commit. The legitimacy of detaining the accused pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 was upheld in United States v. Salerno. A counter-argument is that many people who commit crimes are never caught, so when offenders are caught, sentencing policy should severely disable any group that is highly likely to re-offend. Another criticism of incapacitation is that, if a prisoner is to be eventually released from prison, then his incarceration could be criminogenic, since offenders are more likely to commit a crime after release from prison than previous to incarceration. Increased incarceration might make it increasingly difficult for the inmate to keep his family intact, find work, and avoid associating with other criminals once he is released, all of which may increase the likelihood of re-offending. Incapacitation theories have been criticized for punishing offenders more harshly than would be justified by their culpability and blameworthiness for the offense of conviction. They also may not adequately take into account offenders' potential for rehabilitation. For example, Virginia's sentencing guidelines penalized offenders for being younger than twenty, unmarried, unemployed, or male, even though traditionally youth had been regarded as a mitigating rather than an aggravating circumstance. The goal of determinate sentencing schemes such as federal sentencing guidelines in mitigating sentencing disparities could be thwarted by incapacitation-based schemes that take into account certain factors, such as sex or race, that correlate to recidivism. Another critique of incapacitation is that small increases in prison sentences merely delay crimes rather than preventing them.

The term is also used for a particular formal style of debate in a competitive or educational context. Two teams of two compete through six rounds of argument, giving persuasive speeches on a particular topic.http://www.osaa.org/publications/handbook/0708SPEECHHandbook.pdf  Pre- Debate  Before the round takes place, the teams are designated as either the Affirmative or the Negative. The two teams are then given three topics from which to choose. The Affirmative is given first strike which means that they remove one of the topics from the list. The Negative then is left with two topics to choose from, and will choose which topic they wish to argue by again using their strike and removing the topic they do not wish to talk on. The two teams will then have fifteen minutes to formulate the case they wish to present. At the end of the fifteen minutes the teams reconvene and begin the debate. The members of each team are referred to as the following; * Leader of the Affirmative * Member of the Affirmative * Leader of the Negation * Member of the Negation  Timetable  Prep-Period : 15 minutes Leader Affirmative: 7 minutes Leader Negation: 8 minutes Member Affirmative: 8 minutes Member Negation : 8 minutes Leader Negation Rebuttal: 4 minutes Leader Affirmative Rebuttal: 5 minutes As with any debating style, the individual timings may vary between tournaments  Procedural information  At the beginning of each speech the speaker is expected to thank their partner, the opposition, the judge and anybody who is watching. While not explicitly important it is a formal nicety that is expected of each debater. To ask a question a member of the opposing team stands up and waits for the speaker to take their question. Questioning may occur at any time during the debate with a few exceptions. *If it is a rebuttal *If it is within the first minute of the speech *If it is after the last minute of the speech *If the speaker places any restrictions on the questioning or refuses to answer a question Note that if a speaker refuses to take a question, it can reflect badly on the speaker. Also, a speaker must not ever directly insult or attack their opponents, only the points they are making. Similarly, when a speech is being given side talking is not allowed as it can distract the speaker. The only way that someone may show approval of a topic is to knock on the desk. During a rebuttal speech the speaker is not allowed to bring up any new points of information or talk about anything that has not already been covered.  Leader of the Affirmative  The leader of the Affirmative is responsible for several key points in the debate. As the first speaker they must define the resolution that they selected earlier. For instance, if the resolution is Resolved: this house would abandon the use of torture on enemy combatants. the Leader of the Affirmative would be responsible for defining the meaning of this house , enemy combatants and any other key pieces of the resolution. Whatever they fail to define the Leader of the Opposition is then free to define, which can spell disaster for the Affirmative. The Leader of the Affirmative is also responsible for presenting the plan. the plan is the way that the Affirmative will carry out the resolution. Working off the example resolution above, the plan would be something like, \\" Congress will pass a law expressly stating that any and all forms of inhumane treatment towards peoples in times of war or peace would be expressly forbidden at any level of command\\". If the Affirmative fails to present a plan the negation can claim that they win automatically because the Affirmative did not give them a concrete procedure to argue against and effectively Ruined the educational value of the debate . After this the Affirmative uses the remainder of the time to outline his case.  Leader of the Negation, Member of the Affirmative and Member of the Negation  The three middle speeches all must accomplish two important things in their speeches. The first is the refutation of their opponents case and the second is the building of their own case. It is important to note that if either team fails to do either refute a point given by their opponents or refute a claim on their own case given by their opponents is considered a dropped contention and can result in the loss of the debate.  Rebuttals  Rebuttals are the shortest speeches given in the debate, but are normally the place where debates are won or lost. Each speaker is expected to sum up the important issues of the debate into what are called voters. Each voter is a point of information that a team feels best explains why they have won the debate. During a Rebuttal the speaker is not allowed to bring up new points of information and if they do so it will not be included in the judges decision.  Flow  Debaters utilize a specialized form of note taking, called flowing, to keep track of the arguments presented during a debate. Conventionally, debater's notes are divided into separate flows for each different argument in the debate round. There are multiple methods of flowing but the most common style incorporates columns of arguments made in a given speech which allows the debater to match the next speaker's responses up with the original arguments. Certain shorthands for commonly used words are used to keep up with the rapid rate of delivery. For example, the abbreviation 'HR' may be used to denote 'Human Rights. The abbreviations or stand-in symbols can and do vary between debaters.  Terms  *Value debate: A value debate is one that is about a specific value, such as individual rights or Justice. In a value debate the teams are expected to argue the importance of concepts and not specifically a policy. *Paradigms: The specific likes and dislikes of a Judge *Solvency: The extent to which a particular resolution or plan will effect change. If a plan lacks solvency it means that it will not have any kind of positive impact if implemented. *Peanut Gallery: the audience (while a cute way to get a short laugh in the round, this term is overused and has racial connotations that one may be well advised to avoid). *Voters: Important and central ideas that a Judge should vote on. *Plan: The method that will be employed to carry out a resolution. *Counter Plan: A plan sometimes presented by the Opposition to counter the Affirmatives plan. *Ruining the educational value of a debate: Means that the Affirmative has placed to many restrictions on the topic in a direct attempt to make it difficult for the Opposition to argue against. *Flow: A ongoing set of notes that participates in a debate make to keep track of the points that have been made. *Road mapping: The outline of the points a speaker will make during their speech given before the speech is given to make Flowing easier.

Overview The basic idea is to use a lot of small actuation elements, so that a fault of one element has only a minor effect on the overall system. This way, a High Redundancy Actuator can remain functional even after several elements are at fault. This property is also called graceful degradation. Fault-tolerant operation in the presence of actuator faults requires some form of redundancy. Actuators are essential, because they are used to keep the system stable and to bring it into the desired state. Both requires a certain amount of power or force to be applied to the system. No control approach can work unless the actuators produce this necessary force. So the common solution is to err on the side of safety by over-actuation: much more control action than strictly necessary is built into the system. For critical systems, the normal approach involves straightforward replication of the actuators. Often three or four actuators are used in parallel for aircraft flight control systems, even if one would be sufficient from a control point of view. So if one actuator fails, the remaining actuator can always keep the system operation. While this approach certainly successful, it also makes the system expensive, heavy and ineffective. =Inspiration of high-redundancy actuation= The idea of the high-redundancy actuation (HRA) is inspired by the human musculature. A muscle is composed of many individual muscle cells, each of which provides only a minute contribution to the force and the travel of the muscle. These properties allow the muscle as a whole to be highly resilient to damage of individual cells. Technical realisation The aim of high redundancy actuation is not to produce man-made muscles, but to use the same principle of cooperation in technical actuator's to provide intrinsic fault tolerance. To achieve this, a high number of small actuator elements are assembled in parallel and in series to form one actuator (see Series and parallel circuits). Faults within the actuator will affect the maximum capability, but through robust control, full performance can be maintained without either adaptation or reconfiguration. Some form of condition monitoring is necessary to provide warnings to the operator calling for maintenance. But this monitoring has no influence on the system itself, unlike in adaptive methods or control reconfiguration, which simplifies the design of the system significantly. :File:HRA- configurations.gif The HRA is an important new approach within the overall area of fault-tolerant control, using concepts of reliability engineering on a mechanical level. When applicable, it can provide actuators that have graceful degradation, and that continue to operate at close to nominal performance even in the presence of multiple faults in the actuator elements. =Using actuation elements in series= An important feature of the high-redundancy actuation is that the actuator elements are connected both in parallel and in series. While the parallel arrangement is commonly used, the configuration in series is rarely employed, because it is perceived to be less efficient. However, there is one fault that is difficult to deal with in a parallel arrangement: the locking up of one actuator element. Because parallel actuator elements always have the same extension, one locked-up element can render the whole assembly useless. It is possible to mitigate this by guarding the elements against locking or by limiting the force exerted by a single element. But these measures reduce both the effectiveness of the system and introduce new points of failure. The analysis of the serial configuration shows that it remains operational when one element is locked-up. This fact is important for the High Redundancy Actuator, as fault tolerance is required for different fault types. The goal of the HRA project is to use parallel and serial actuator elements to accommodate both the blocking and the inactivity (loss of force) of an element. =Available technology= The basic idea of high- redundancy actuation is technology agnostic: it should be applicable to a wide range of actuator technology, including different kinds of linear actuators and rotational actuators. However, initial experiments are performed with electric actuators, especially with electromechanical and electromagnetic technology. Compared to pneumatic actuators, the electrical drive allow a much finer control of position and force. References Further reading * M. Blanke, M. Kinnaert, J. Lunze, M. Staroswiecki, J.

Among the standard objectives were 3 cm Zeiss Tessar and a 3 cm Zeiss Tessar in 1:2,8 and 1:3,5 variations, a 1:2,0/40 mm Zeiss Biotar and 1:4/7,5 cm Zeiss Sonnar. The film cassette system was redesigned but it was only with the Robot IIa launched in 1951 that film could accept a standard 35 mm cassette. The special Robot cassettes type-N continued their role for take up. A small bakelite box was sold to allow people to rewind colour film into the original cassettes as demanded by the film processing companies. The camera was synchronized for flash. The swinging viewfinder was retained but now operated by a lever rather than moving the entire housing. Both the deep purple filter and the yellow filter were eliminated in the redesign. Some versions were available with a double wind motor which could expose 50 frames. The Second World War stopped civilian production of the Robot but it was used as a gun camera by the Luftwaffe. The Robot II took square photographs in the 24×24mm format, which allowed 50 exposures to fit on a 36-exposure film. It featured an all-metal Rotor shutter (1/4 to 1/500), a direct vision finder, and a screw mount for interchangeable lenses by Schneider. The standard lens is a Schneider Xenon 40 mm f1.9. Also available was the Robot Star II/50, with a double spring motor for 50 exposures and a Xenar 38 mm f2.8 lens. The Robot Royal has \\"Kinographic\\" capability of 4 or 5 exposures per second.

Early life Chris Giarrusso is a native of Upstate New York, and comes from an artistic family. His mother actively pursued arts and crafts as a pastime, his father enjoys photography, his brother Matt is a musician, and his older brother Dave, like Giarrusso himself, enjoys drawing. Giarrusso looked up to Dave in particular, and names him as the primary creative influence on his art style and career. As a child, Giarrusso, an avid fan of Marvel Comics, would go to a comics shop every weekend with his mother, although his father was not as pleased with his son's choice of reading material. Giarrusso also enjoyed drawing, but did so intermittently, because he lacked confidence in his abilities, often becoming frustrated with his work and destroying his drawings. He was also influenced the newspaper strips he and his brother read, most notably Charles Schultz's Peanuts. Others included Garfield, B.C., For Better or For Worse, Heathcliff, Marmaduke, Dennis the Menace and Beetle Bailey.

Its programs seek to help jazz and blues musicians in need of emergency funds and connect them with performance opportunities in schools and the community. The Jazz Musicians' Emergency Fund and Housing Fund, established with corporate help, assists freelance musicians who lack benefits, pensions, or health insurance to cover one-time expenses. Musicians can apply to the foundation's social workers for help with rent, housing, mortgage payments, and health care. The foundation created a volunteer network of professionals throughout the United States to provide free legal, dental, and other health services when needed. The foundation's Jazz in the Schools program occurs in eight states as educational outreach and an employment service. The program offers free performances by musicians which include information about instruments and the history of jazz. Musicians are paid by the foundation. The Varis/Jazz in Schools program employs over 120 musicians in New York City and hundreds throughout the south, reaching public schools and hospital schools. The current Artistic Directors are Steve Jordan and Meegan Voss. History The organization began with founder Herb Storfer and friends Ann Ruckert, Stella Marrs, Jimmy Owens, Vishnu Wood, Jamil Nassar, Phoebe Jacobs, and Billy Taylor in 1989. Storfer housed the foundation in his Manhattan loft. Funds were raised by selling tickets to jam sessions in the loft. The Jazz Foundation of America was incorporated in 1990. This was followed by an event at Town Hall which raised over sixty thousand dollars to establish the Jazz Emergency Fund. Jazz musicians Jamil Nassar and Jimmy Owens became the organization's outreach network, connecting musicians in need of rent money or medical payments to the organization's founder. The committee of founders began to network with other service organizations who shared similar objectives. The Actor's Fund and MusiCares provided part-time social workers for the foundation's substance abuse programs. From 1997 to 2000, executive director Susan Cipollone made one or two assessments per day and helped about 35 musicians in a year. The foundation offered substance abuse programs and began their Monday night jam sessions as a way of hiring musicians in need. The board of directors consists of friends and acquaintances who offered service. When jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie died in 1993, one of his last requests was that any jazz musician in need of medical care be treated free of charge at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. His request was that doctors provide free treatment to one musician per year. This was changed to a pro bono network of physicians at Englewood Hospital & Health Center to treat musicians. Physicians Frank Forte and Bob led the Dizzy Gillespie Memorial Fund while the foundation referred clients to the hospital for treatment. The organization provided uninsured jazz musicians with $300,000 a year in pro bono medical care and operations. The organization moved into an office in the Local 802 branch of the American Federation of Musicians. In 2000 Wendy Oxenhorn became executive director and increased the number of musicians assisted from 35 per year to over 150. Oxenhorn organized \\"A Great Night in Harlem\\" in 2001 at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. She had financial support from Jarrett Lilien, the COO of E-Trade who became the board's president. Lilien started a support network to try to prevent musicians from becoming destitute. The foundation helped musicians in New York City after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 by paying their bills and trying to find other venues at which they could perform. With $100,000 from the Music Performance Trust Fund and help from Local 802 Union., the foundation created school performances for over 400 musicians. The foundation's cases increased from 35 to 500 cases per year. After Hurricane Katrina, Oxenhorn met Agnes Varis at an event hosted by Dick Parsons was hosting, telling her about the need to help musicians in New Orleans. Varis agreed to give $250,000 to create a Jazz in the Schools program in which musicians were paid for one-hour educational performances in local schools. Over 20 million dollars were raised since the first concert and over 6,000 emergency assists were possible each year. A Great Night in Harlem The foundation derives much of its funding from its annual fundraiser, \\"A Great Night in Harlem,\\" held every May. This event includes a concert at the Apollo Theater which has been hosted by Danny Glover, Bill Cosby, Gil Noble, and Danny Aiello. Past performers include Odetta, Dr. John, Little Jimmy Scott, Henry Butler, Dr. Michael White, Quincy Jones, Regina Carter, Elvis Costello, Arturo O'Farrill, Candido Camero, Sweet Georgia Brown, Whoopi Goldberg, Chevy Chase, Joe Piscopo, Norah Jones, Hank Jones, Dave Brubeck, Jimmy Heath, Paul Shaffer, and Jimmy Norman.

He is best known for his research on southern African San (Bushmen) rock art, of which it can be said that he found a 'Rosetta Stone'. He is the founder and previous director of the Rock Art Research Institute and is currently professor emeritus of cognitive archaeology at the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS). Lewis-Williams is recognised by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa as a leading international researcher, with an A1 rating. Theoretical influences Lewis-Williams was exposed to social anthropology as an undergraduate at UCT. During this time he received lectures from renowned social anthropologist A. R. Radcliffe-Brown (who started the department of social anthropology at UCT in 1920 but later returned as a visiting lecturer) and Monica Wilson, a student of Bronislaw Malinowski. Malinowski’s ideas specifically concerning the association of ritual with social products meant that Lewis-Williams could eventually challenge the idea that San rock art was merely a narrative of everyday life. Thus, from the start of his career and in contrast to most scholars of the period, Lewis- Williams was looking at San rock art from a social anthropological perspective. Following proofs of an article by South African scholar Patricia Vinnicombe, shown to him in 1966 by Professor Ray Inskeep (then editor of the South African Archaeological Bulletin), Lewis-Williams used a quantitative method for the analysis of rock art images in the Drakensberg. Overall he recorded some 4000 images for his doctoral thesis research. His PhD, finished in 1977 and later published in 1981 as and Seeing: Symbolic meanings in southern San rock paintings., is regarded as a seminal text in rock art research globally. The quantitative method now bears little impact on the understanding of meaning behind images in San rock art. There is simply too much ambiguity in what the numerical values can be said to imply. In the early 1980s Lewis-Williams began to investigate other theoretical approaches. This was because he At that time in South Africa, during apartheid, Marxism was the 'language of liberation' and the only other social theory available. In The economic and social context of southern San rock art (1982), Lewis-Williams explored the economic position of the shaman in San society. Using Maurice Godelier's ideas of symbolic work, Lewis-Williams investigated the ritual role of shamans in terms of San social structure and the context of rock art. Concerns for the other members of San society are seen in his research that draws on Key research concepts =Ethnography= A foundation to Lewis- Williams's work has been the use of ethnography. As an undergraduate he was exposed to Isaac Schapera's The Khoisan Peoples of South Africa (1930) From the start of his professional career he drew on ethnography to address the meaning of San rock art. In 1968, he read philologist Wilhelm Bleek and his sister-in-law Lucy Lloyd's Specimens of Bushman Folklore, and later engaged with the manuscripts the archive of transcriptions of conversations with ǀXam- speaking San people from the 1870s. Although he never met her, Bleek's daughter, Dorothea Bleek, held a position in social anthropology at UCT where the archival collection is housed . Other available ethnographic sources have been central in Lewis-Williams's work, particularly the accounts provided by Colonial administrator Joseph Orpen in an article published in 1874 about his conversations with a San guide named Qing, the words spoken to Marion Walsham How by the southern Sotho man called Mapote, and the Kalahari San ethnographies that developed from the work of the Marshall family and others during the 1950s and 1960s. The 'trance dance, as practised by the Ju/'hoansi in Botswana and Namibia in the twentieth century, has been at the centre of Lewis-Williams' arguments about shamanism and altered states of consciousness as the source of the images seen in southern African rock art. However, several researchers (including the artist Pippa Skotnes, the literary scholar Michael Wessels and the archaeologist Anne Solomon) dispute Lewis-Williams's interpretation of the important /Xam San ethnographic texts that describe dances and healing =Shamanism= Shamanism, which derives from the Siberian Tungus word shaman, was used by Lewis-Williams to explain the metaphor of death that he alleges is common to both ethnography and San rock art. The shamanic world often has tiered realms inhabited by spirits that can be accessed through altered states of consciousness (ASC). The world inhabited by people is supplemented by other realms that are usually conceptualised as existing above or below the inhabited world. Shamans have the ability to mediate between these other worlds. For the San, other realms were accessed during altered states of consciousness, and at rock faces where rock art can be found: More significantly, Lewis-Williams claims that the collection of San ethnography demonstrates the trance or healing dance, see San healing practices, is at the core of San belief, Metaphors for death are supposedly contained in the trance dance. As San shamans dance, their supernatural power, or ‘potency’, builds up until it reaches a breaking point and flies out of the body. At this point, they ‘die’, a metaphor for travelling to another realm where spirits dwell in the same way as the soul travels after leaving after physical death. However, there are methodological issues concerning the use of 20th century ethnographies, from peoples who did not make rock art, as analogous to interpret art elsewhere that is hundreds or even thousands of years older. Lewis-Williams argues that the trance dance correlates with symbolism in the rock art. Features depicted in images that, it is argued, relate to altered states of consciousness, include nasal bleeding and the ‘arms back’ posture. Lewis-Williams and Megan Biesele (known for her work with the Ju/'hoan people) showed that the gap between different groups of San and different traditions of rock art could be bridged because of similar terms and concepts centred around the dance used by both the /Xam San in the south and the Ju/'hoansi San people in the north. Building on the work of previous scholars such as Lorna Marshall and Daniel McCall regarding a 'pan-San' belief system, Biesele and Lewis-Williams together suggested that the conceptual linguistic terms and ritual observances similar to the Ju/'hoansi and Xam could be used to understand the complexity of the images. Indeed, Lewis- Williams writes that =Neuropsychology= The idea of a conceptual belief system was expanded upon using neuropsychology. Together with Thomas Dowson, Lewis-Williams explored the relationship between universal neuropsychological patterns in the wiring of the human brain and practices in shamanistic societies. Using data produced from laboratory experiments with hallucinogens, they proposed a neuropsychological model with multiple stages of hallucinations experienced during altered states of consciousness. Simply put, the model demonstrates the relationship between altered states of consciousness and the subjective interpretation of hallucinations. The premise of the neuropsychological model is that there is a difference between cultural imagery and neurologically produced visual patterns known as entoptic phenomena. During ASCs, which can be induced in a number of ways, the first stage of hallucination experienced by a subject contains only entoptic phenomena, such as the scintillating scotoma experienced by migraine sufferers. The second stage begins when the hallucinations are construed by the subject into culturally familiar content. The implication of this is that entoptic phenomena will be understood differently in different cultures. The final stage is one of deep visual and somatic hallucinations, with multiple images and sensations understood in a cultural context. Despite being able to explain why geometric and representational forms occur together in much hunter-gatherer art worldwide, and providing a 'universal' link through human neurology if cultural differences are allowed, the model has been criticised. Critics have two concerns. First, the cross-cultural extrapolation of shamanism, and second, pushing this idea far into the past. In reply, Lewis- Williams holds to the neuropsychological model but emphasises that the idea of shamanism is not a simple analogy, it requires contextual definition. Furthermore, there is a need to have the idea behind the neuropsychological model practically demonstrated in further examples than the rock art of the San, Coso people and Upper Palaeolithic used in The signs of all times: entoptic phenomena in Upper Palaeolithic art (1988). Research in European caves Lewis-Williams has studied much Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France since the 1970s. He argues that there are parallels between San rock and French Upper Palaeolithic rock art based on the neuropsychological model outlined above. In 1972, he met André Leroi-Gourhan (a French prehistoric archaeologist who worked on Upper Palaeolithic rock art) at a conference in Valcamonica, Italy. Leroi-Gourhan was working at Lascaux at that time and tried to arrange for Lewis-William to view the cave sites of the Dordogne. Unfortunately, they were unable to co-ordinate their dates and it was only much later that he visited Lascaux. With the help of scholars such as Jean Clottes (another French prehistoric archaeologist), he has been able to continue working with, and visiting, caves of the Franco-Cantabrian region, such as the famous Chauvet cave.

Aside from the Pen F series of half-frame SLRs, they are fixed-lens viewfinder cameras. In 2009, Olympus introduced the PEN E-P1, a Micro Four Thirds system digital camera which the company touts as the next-generation Pen camera. All Olympus PEN digital camera series have built-in sensor-shift image stabilisation and (except for the E-P1) can use optional electronic viewfinder which should be slid into its hotshoe.  General context  The original Pen was introduced in 1959. It was designed by Yoshihisa Maitani, and was the first half-frame camera produced in Japan. It was one of the smallest cameras to use 35mm film in regular 135 cassettes. It was thought to be as portable as a pen; thus the name. The idea was to be much copied by other Japanese makers. A series of derivatives followed, some easier to use with the introduction of exposure automation, e.g. the Pen EE; others with a wider aperture lens and a manual meter, such as the Pen D. In 1966 the arrival of the Rollei 35, a camera almost as compact but making normal 24×36 exposures, would announce the beginning of the end for the half-frame concept. However, Olympus went on producing the simpler models of the Pen family until at least 1983. In the descriptions below, the focal lengths indicated do not give the same angle of view as for full-frame cameras: 30mm on the Pen is roughly equivalent to 45mm on a full-frame, and 28mm to a 40mm.  Pen and Pen S  The original Pen is a very compact half-frame camera, with just a viewfinder, no meter and fully manual settings. It has a 28mm f/3.5 Zuiko lens. Its shutter settings are 25, 50, 100, 200, B; its aperture range from 3.5 to 22. The back is removed completely for film loading and unloading. The Pen S is almost the same camera, with the following shutter settings: 8, 15, 30, 60, 125, 250, B. It existed in two versions, with a 30mm f/2.8 lens or a 28mm f/3.5 lens.  D series  Pen D3 The Pen D was a more expensive model, launched in 1962. It has a 32mm f/1.9 lens, a shutter going to 1/500 and an uncoupled selenium meter. The Pen D2, launched in 1964, is the same model with an uncoupled CdS exposure meter replacing the selenium one. The Pen D3, launched in 1965, is the same with a 32mm f/1.7 lens.  EE series  The Pen EE was introduced in 1961 and was the amateur model, with fully automatic exposure and fixed focusing. It is a true point and shoot camera, and has a 28mm f/3.5 lens. The Pen EE family is easily recognized by the selenium meter window around the lens. EE.S The Pen EE.S, launched in 1962, is the same model with a 30mm f/2.8 and a focusing ring, made necessary by the wider aperture. In 1966 the two cameras were slightly modified and became the Pen EE (EL) and Pen EE.S (EL) with a modification of the take-up spool to make film loading easier. EL stands for Easy Loading. You can only recognize them by a small label marked EL stuck on the front, or you can open them and look at the take-up spool. The Pen EE.2, produced from 1968 to 1977, is nearly the same as the Pen EE with the addition of a hot shoe. EE.3 The Pen EE.3, produced from 1973 to 1983, seems to be almost exactly the same camera except that it added the \\"Flashmatic\\" system when used with the matching GN14 flash. The Pen EE.S2, produced from 1968 to 1971, is the same as the Pen EE.S with the addition of a hot shoe. EE.D The Pen EE.D, produced from 1967 to 1972, is a more expensive automated-exposure model, with a CdS meter, a 32mm f/1.7 lens and a hot shoe. The Pen EF, launched in 1981, was the last Pen model. It is like the Pen EE.2 or Pen EE.3, but with a small built-in flash, and was only sold in black finish with white letterings.  Pen Wide  The Pen W or Pen Wide is a very rare variant of the Pen S model, with a wide-angle 25mm f/2.8 lens, equivalent to a 35mm in full format. It only exists in black finish, and has a cold flash shoe. It was only produced between 1964 and 1965, and today fetches high prices on the collectors' market.  Pen EM  The Pen EM, produced from 1965 to 1966, is a motorized Pen model. It has a 35mm f/2 lens, and a CdS exposure meter allowing automatic or manual exposure.  PEN F, PEN FT, PEN FV  PEN F The Olympus PEN F series of cameras were half-frame SLR cameras produced between 1963 and 1970. The cameras were unique in using a rotary shutter.  Pen Rapid models  The Pen Rapid EE.S and Pen Rapid EE.D were variants of the Pen EE.S and Pen EE.D designed to accept the Agfa Rapid cassette instead of the regular 35mm cassette. They were both made from 1965 to 1966, and met very little success.  Digital PEN  E-P1 In June 2009, Olympus announced the PEN E-P1, an interchangeable lens Micro Four Thirds system digital camera which carries on in the PEN tradition. Its external design is clearly inspired by the traditional PEN series. In January 2010, Olympus followed up the release of the E-P1 with the E-P2. For the most part, the E-P2 is identical to the E-P1 except it is available in all-black, and includes the ability to mount a high resolution electronic viewfinder. It also features two new art filters. The new port included for the electronic viewfinder can also be used for a microphone (not included). The suggested retail price at release was US$1099. The long-awaited Olympus E-P3 was announced on June 30, 2011, to positive reviews. On February 3, 2010, Olympus Corporation announced a third camera, the Olympus PEN E-PL1, L standing for Lite.Olympus. \\"OLYMPUS PEN E-PL1 Micro Four Thirds interchangeable lens system camera with a new Live Guide interface.\\" February 3, 2010. Retrieved March 24, 2017. The camera was a success, with the E-PL2 following almost a year later, and the E-PL3 arriving in fourth quarter 2011. On June 30, 2011, along with the E-PL3 and E-P3 announcements Olympus also announced the E-PM1, or \\"Pen Mini\\".Photoxels. \\"Olympus Announces E-P3, E-PL3 and E-PM1.\\" June 30, 2011. Retrieved April 7, 2017. The Mini was released with almost exactly the same specifications as the E-PL3 but in a slightly smaller and lighter package. The most notable difference, aside from price, being the lack of a tilting screen on the Mini. Also followed: the Pen E-PM2, E-PL5, E-PL6, E-P5, E-PL7. The E-P5 is relatively bigger, and has the more advanced 5-axis sensor stabilization. All three use the same Sony 16 megapixel sensor as the OM-D camera. The most recent introduction is the PEN E-PL7 that ties together the same technology and image quality as the more traditional looking relative, the OM-D E-M10, with more trend related features such as a tilt down LCD to make taking a \\"selfie\\" that much easier. Indeed, updates to Olympus own free OIShare App also drive the self-portrait and share message. The app will show a live preview of your image via a wifi connection to the camera and let you control a host of camera functions from zoom to new art filters before you take the shot which will then download to your smartphone to let you post on social media.

A common variety is the 18×24 mm format on regular 135 film. It is the normal exposure format on 35mm movie cameras. For still cameras using the 35mm film, the usual format is 24×36 mm, so still cameras taking 18×24 mm exposures are called half-frame cameras. There was a vogue of half-frame cameras in the 1960s, mainly from Japan, originating with the Olympus Pen models. It allowed for a very compact camera, using commonly available film, unlike other subminiatures that used exotic films (16mm, 9.3mm, etc.). This vogue ended when cameras like the Rollei 35 or the Olympus XA showed that it was possible to make cameras as small as the half-frame ones, but taking 24×36 mm exposures. With a half-frame camera, twice as many pictures will fit onto a standard roll of film. For example, 72 exposures on a 36-exposure roll, 40 on a 20-exposure one, and so on. This reduces the film cost per exposure. Color negative film was expensive during the heyday of the half-frame camera, and the use of half-frame cameras could save money. The exposures have a vertical (portrait) orientation as opposed to the horizontal (landscape) orientation of a 35mm SLR or rangefinder, with the exception of cameras whose film mechanisms run vertically (examples include the Konica Recorder and Belomo Agat 18). The most advanced half-frame camera that was designed as such from the start is the Yashica Samurai single lens reflex. For some specific needs, there were cameras originally designed for full-frame pictures that were produced or custom modified in very small series as half- frame models, for example some Leica (1950 made in Canada Leica 72), Nikon (1960-61 Nikon S3M 18x24mm rangefinder) or Robot (Robot 24x24mm camera) rangefinders, and some Alpa (Alpa 18x24 SLR) or Minolta SLRs.A batch of 30 Minolta X-300 35mm full-frame SLRs custom modified to half-frame for the police in the Netherlands Forum article in German Minolta-Forum as of 2007] These are mainly of interest as collectibles.

The novel explores what happens to a person (Jack) when he is given a label and is not allowed to escape from it. Plot summary Jack is a highly educated high school teacher at a private school for girls in New England. However, he is falsely accused of having an inappropriate relationship with one of his students, to which he pleads guilty to a lesser charge and is sentenced to eight months in prison. Jack's mother refuses to believe his claims of innocence and abandons him. After serving his sentence, Jack wants to have a fresh start, which he finds when he wanders into a diner in Salem Falls, New Hampshire. Without disclosing his past, he is hired as a dishwasher. He begins a romantic relationship with Addie Peabody, the woman who operates the diner with her father, Roy. At the time, she is still mourning the death of her young daughter, Chloe, who died from bacterial meningitis at six-years-old. Under law, he is required to register with the local police as a convicted sex offender. As this is public record, the entire town becomes aware of his past. However, Addie does not change her attitude toward him. Simultaneously, the novel focuses on local teenage girls who experiment with Wicca: disturbed Gillian, the daughter of Amos Duncan a prominent businessman; Chelsea; Whitney; and Meg. One night, Jack accidentally stumbles upon them in the woods while they are celebrating the Wiccan holiday of Beltane. He is accused of sexually assaulting Gillian. Due to his intoxicated state at the time, he is unable to recall exactly where he was that night. Jack is defended by attorney Jordan McAfee. Throughout the trial, Jordan casts reasonable doubt on Gillian's testimony. However, Meg confides in Addie that she remembers Jack touching her in a sexual manner. Addie takes Meg to report the incident to policeman Charlie, who is Meg's father. Clues begin to unravel that Gillian has been lying about the assault. Sources allege that she and her clique were taking hallucinogenic drugs. The initial blood screening test Gillian took showed no evidence of drugs. Jordan hires a private toxicologist to run tests on the blood samples, which reveal extreme amounts of a hallucinogen. Gillian's psychiatric records reveal that she was known to be a compulsive liar after the death of her mother. Chelsea, feeling a sense of conscience, mails \\"The Book of Shadows\\" (a witch's handbook and proof that the teenagers are part of a witch's coven) to Thomas, Jordan's son, who takes it to Jordan. Jordan uses the book as evidence against Gillian and Jack is found not guilty. After the trial, Meg reveals to her father that Gillian convinced the teenagers to fabricate everything as a game to see if they could ruin Jack's life because Gillian was attracted to him and he turned her down. Meg's report of Jack having touched her is revealed to be accidental, as Jack was saving Meg from a fall and accidentally touched her breast. It is revealed that Addie was gang-raped at sixteen by Charlie and Amos, two powerful men. As such, she never knew who Chloe's father was. Jack offers to move with Addie to New York in an effort to reconcile with his mother. Addie agrees. The final twist is saved for the last paragraph. Amos has been sexually abusing his daughter, Gillian, since she was a young child. The reader comes to understand that Amos has continued to abuse her, and it is likely that the seminal fluid found on Gillian's thigh is his, not Jack's. Characters * Jack St. Bride: Protagonist, a former star athlete and high school history teacher who is accused and convicted of statutory rape. He is an avid watcher of Jeopardy!. * Addie Peabody: Owns and operates the diner in Salem Falls, along with her father, Roy.

In the movie, they meet when Addie's father causes a car accident which Jack is involved in. 6) In the book, Jack cleans up Chloe's bedroom and Addie gets mad. This doesn't happen in the movie; he's more understanding of Addie's wish to pretend Chloe is alive. 7) In the book, Addie was gang-raped at sixteen and wasn't positive about who Chloe's biological father was. In the movie, Amos was the only one who raped her; she was raped right after she turned seventeen. 8) In the book, Selena helps Jordan with Jack's case. Selena is not a character in the movie. 9) In the book, the bookstore is called Wiccan Read and the employee's name is Starshine.

In the movie, she adds dark streaks. 11) In the book, Meg remembers Jack touching her and Addie takes her to the police. The touch is later revealed to be accidental contact with her breast when Jack was saving her from a fall. In the movie, Meg remembers Jack touching her; she only tells Gilly, who slaps her and says Jack never touched her. 12) In the book, Jack goes to trial and is found not guilty. In the movie, he doesn't go to trial. 13) In the book, it's hinted at the end that Amos has been raping Gilly for years. In the movie (with Addie's support), Gilly recants her accusation against Jack and tells the police who really raped her. Jack gets released and Amos gets arrested. 14) In the book, Gilly's mom died when she was eight. In the movie, Addie tells Jack that Gilly's mom left town when she was young. 15) In the book, Chloe died from bacterial meningitis when she was ten; at the time of the book, she's been dead for seven years. In the movie, she died from bacterial meningitis when she was six; at the time of the movie, she's been dead for almost three years. 16) In the book, Jack is a huge Jeopardy fan. There's no mention of this in the movie. 17) In the book, Jack is rebellious when he's in jail awaiting trial; he refuses to put on the orange jumpsuit, isn't allowed visitors (due to his noncooperation), and is taken to solitary. In the movie, he only refuses to put on the orange jumpsuit. In both the book and movie, he eventually does cooperate. 18) In the book, Jack moves into Addie's house when his room above the diner catches on fire. In the movie, his room doesn't catch on fire and he moves into Addie's house when they start seeing each other. 19) In the book, the New Hampshire sex offender code is 651-B. In the movie, it's 671-B. 20) In the book, Catherine (who is sixteen) recants her accusation at Jack's trial; she admits that she lied about them having an affair. In the movie, she's not old enough to recant without her parents' permission (her eighteenth birthday is in two months), but her father won't let her recant. However, she's willing to tell the truth as soon she's eighteen. 21) In the book, the waitress' name is Darla. In the movie, her name is Maggie. 22) In the book (after Jack is found not guilty), Meg tells her father (a cop) that Gilly made up the rape accusation because she was interested in Jack and he turned her down. In the movie, it's revealed through a conversation with her friends that Gilly made up the rape accusation. 23) In the book, the school where Jack taught is called Westonbrook Academy. In the movie, it's called Westbrook Girls Preparatory School. 24) In the book, Jack asks Addie if she believes he's innocent; she says she doesn't know, but she wants to believe him. In the movie, she does believe he's innocent. 25) In the book, Gilly spills sugar on the table and Jack tells her that she's making a mess. In the movie, Gilly hides the sugar packets from the container on her table and she asks Jack for more. In both the book and movie, Gilly does these things purposefully so she has an excuse to talk to Jack. 26) In the book, when Addie pretends Chloe is alive, the diner staff humour her. There's no mention of this in the movie. 27) In the book, Jack has a fight with Addie (over him cleaning Chloe's room). She tells him to leave, and he goes to a bar and gets drunk. In the movie, he goes to a bar and gets drunk after he sees negative graffiti about him spray- painted outside the diner. 28) In the book, Jack is beaten by five men (two are identified as Chelsea's father and Whitney's father), and Addie thinks the police were involved. This doesn't happen in the movie. 29) In the book, Jack has an aversion to being touched; the aversion goes away as he and Addie begin a relationship. There's no mention of this in the movie. 30) In the book, Jack steals some of Chloe's French fries (he missed breakfast at the prison because it was served when he was being processed to leave) and Addie tells him not to eat her meal. Later, when he eats a burger, he sets a few of his own fries and his pickle on her plate, saying he owed her. In the movie, he tries to clear her plate of pancakes and Addie tells him not to take away her food. When Wes tries to convince Addie to take a walk with him (and he doesn't want to take no for an answer), Jack gives Addie a ketchup bottle and says it's for Chloe's fries. 31) In the book, Delilah (a chef at the diner) tells Jack that Chloe's dead. In the movie, Roy tells Jack that Chloe's dead. 32) In the book, during a town meeting Amos calls, someone says he doesn't want a rapist living in Salem Falls. In the movie, the man refers to Jack as a pervert. 33) In the book, Jordan sarcastically applauds Amos' intent to run Jack out of town; he says parents should start punishing their kids before they do anything bad, Charlie should start cuffing people, and run license plate numbers and issue tickets at random because eventually someone will get in trouble. In the movie, Jordan says he needs to go home and punish his son for the things he hasn't done, that he's always thought Charlie should start arresting more people, and that he should shut down his law practice—since if they know who's going to commit a crime, they can run them out of town before they do and a legal system isn't really needed. 34) In the book, Jordan's son Thomas tutors Chelsea in Algebra. In the movie, he tutors her in Chemistry.

A wired intercom system may incorporate wireless elements. There are many types of wireless intercom systems on the market. Most wireless intercom systems communicate by radio waves using one of the frequencies allotted by various government agencies. Some wireless intercom systems communicate using the 802.11 standard.http://www.nucleusintercom.com There are also systems that advertise themselves as wireless, but communicate over existing building AC electrical wiring.  Basic terms  *Station - A wireless intercom unit. *Outdoor Intercom - This is an intercom that can be placed by a building's doors and it operates like a doorbell, but people inside can talk to the visitor. *Channels - Some wireless intercom systems have more than one channel so private conversations can occur between groups of intercoms. *Range - This is the maximum range an intercom will communicate under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions mean no obstructions between units. *Monitor - Usually this means the ability to listen to what is happening at a wireless intercom unit. *Conference - The ability to talk to multiple intercom units at once. *Paging - Paging function enables you to broadcast to all the stations in the location.  Wired vs. Wireless  One reason to use a wireless intercom system is that the cost of retrofitting a building for a wired intercom system is high. Another reason is the increased portability of a wireless system. With battery-powered radio frequency wireless intercom units, a person can carry a station as they walk around. One of the challenges of a wireless system is the possibility of interference. Radio frequency wireless systems may get interference from other wireless devices. Some wireless intercom designs reduce this interference by using \\"digital spread spectrum\\". =Encrypted wireless= Wired intercom is inherently private, so long as the wiring system isn't tapped by outside parties. Wireless intercom is not inherently private; conversations on a wireless intercom are broadcast using publicly available wireless frequencies which means other users with similar devices could listen in if they are within range. Most units on the market will allow intercom conversations to be heard through other devices such as scanners, baby monitors, cordless telephones, or the same brand of wireless intercom. Wireless intercom privacy can be provided if the audio stream is encrypted. Telex, HME, Altair and other intercom manufacturers offer encrypted wireless intercom for corporate, military and sports team customers desiring instant voice communications with privacy.HME DX200 encrypted wireless intercomTelex BTR-1 encrypted wireless intercom The first use of encrypted wireless intercom in American football was in 1996; by 1999 it was being used in the Super Bowl.Telex Legacy Audio frequency response of current products is limited to less than 4 kHz; this means that natural vocal sibilances above 4 kHz are absent. Ess sounds like eff, requiring additional spoken clarification such as saying \\"'S' as in 'Sam'\\".  U.S. & Canada Wireless Frequencies  The United States and Canada have several frequency ranges for wireless intercom systems and other wireless products. They are 49 MHz, FM band (160–270 kHz), 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz, and MURS (150 MHz). The frequency that will work best for an application depends on the wireless devices already in use not only in the building itself, but also in surrounding buildings. For instance, if a residence is using wireless networking which operates in the 2.4 GHz range, a wireless intercom that operates in this range may interfere with the network and vice versa. Ideally, the best intercom for an application would be one that is in a frequency not in use in the surrounding area, or one that uses digital spread spectrum to reduce possibility of interference. \\"Wireless Intercom Frequency Ranges\\" page of IntercomsOnline.com. Systems that use existing electrical cabling The first intercom systems communicated over a set of low-voltage signal wires installed in the walls of a building. The installation was typically done during the building’s construction, but buildings could be retrofitted with communication wires, at a cost. Non-radio \\"wireless\\" intercom designs were developed that used a building's existing electrical wiring to carry communication signals. Such systems work similarly to normal wired intercom designs, with intercom stations using wires to connect to electrical outlets in rooms. This method of intercom connection is most useful in offices and homes served by a single electrical service.
