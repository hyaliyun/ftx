From a young age, she developed a love for the outdoors and also for the theater. She received a BA in English literature and botany from Smith College in 1911. With Portia Mansfield, she established the Perry-Mansfield Performing Arts School & Camp in Steamboat Springs, Colorado in 1913. Besides the arts: dance, drama, art and music, the camp incorporated outdoor activities including tennis, swimming, horseback riding and overnight camping. It later became the oldest continuous dance school and camp in the United States. In 1994, she school was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Alumni included actors Lee Remick, Dustin Hoffman and Julie Harris. When Portia Mansfield established the Portia Mansfield Dancers, later the Perry-Mansfield Dancers, Perry served as general designer and technical director and later was one of the leading dancers for the company.

The nearest higher peak is Dragontail Peak, to the east, and Argonaut Peak lies to the southwest. The Colchuck Glacier which lies on the northeast slopes of the peak melts into Colchuck Lake. The mountain and glacier take their name from the lake, which in Chinook jargon means \\"cold water\\". Precipitation runoff from the peak drains north into Mountaineer Creek, a tributary of Icicle Creek, or south into Ingalls Creek, all of which winds up in the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology Colchuck Peak detail The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Colchuck Peak is situated in part of the Mount Stuart batholith, a large area of clean granite rock that forms the Stuart Range. Argonaut Peak (left) and Colchuck Peak (right) During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

It is a type of ginataan. A common version of the dish, known as ginataang paksiw na isda or paksiw na isda sa gata, is additionally soured with vinegar (a cooking method known as paksiw). Ginataang isda is a type of ginataan. Names Ginataang isda is a more generalized name meaning \\"fish in coconut milk\\". It is more common, however, to name the dish based on the type of fish used. The typical fish used in ginataang isda include: ginataang tilapia (tilapia), ginataang tambakol (yellowfin tuna), ginataang galunggong (blackfin scad), and ginataang tulingan (skipjack tuna). Description Aside from fish, the secondary ingredient of ginataang isda are leafy vegetables. These are most commonly pechay, but can also be made from other leafy vegetables like mustard greens, spinach, cabbage, and bitter melon leaves, among others. The spices used include garlic, ginger (or turmeric), onion, salt, and black pepper. For a richer flavor, patis (fish sauce) or bagoong alamang (shrimp paste) is also commonly added. A spicier version of the dish can also be created by the addition of siling haba and/or labuyo chilis. The coconut milk used includes both the thin coconut milk, added first, and the thicker coconut cream, added later. Variants A common variant of the dish is ginataang paksiw na isda or paksiw na isda sa gata, which is prepared identically but differs in the addition of vinegar to sour the broth. This variant combines the ginataan and paksiw methods of cooking in Filipino cuisine. Similar dishes Because of the ubiquity of coconut milk in Filipino cuisine, there are numerous other types of Filipino dishes that use fish in coconut milk that are considered different dishes from ginataang isda.

The software uses voter data such as names, addresses, and previous voting records to allow political actors to centralise, build and manage political campaigns by integrating various communication tools like websites, newsletters, text messaging and social media channels under one platform. Alt URL Alt URL The software's appeal comes from the combination a number of previously separate campaigning services, channels and data sources into a single platform that was presented as a facile solution for non-technical users and which enabled political campaigners to quickly deploy campaigns by convincing numerous people to donate. Among other features, the software enables political parties to quickly create websites, build databases through registrations, send targeted newsletters, analyse data from multiple sources and leverage micro-donations.  History  NationBuilder was founded in 2009 in Los Angeles by Jim Gilliam and launched in 2011. In 2012 Joe Green joined NationBuilder as co-founder and president. He left that role 11 months later in February of 2013. Gilliam was previously a movie-maker who co-founded Brave New Films with Robert Greenwald and had sought funding for his films through crowd-sourcing. Green, who studied organizing at Harvard and was Mark Zuckerberg's roommate, is also the co-founder of the Causes Facebook app; he left NationBuilder in 2013. They both claim that NationBuilder is strictly nonpartisan. Since its founding, the company has helped campaigns raise $1.2 billion. In 2012, NationBuilder announced than 1,000 subscribers have used its software to amass 2.5 million supporters and raise $12 million in campaign donations. In 2015 it has helped raise $264 million, recruit over one million volunteers and coordinate some 129,000 events. By 2016, the company said its software was used by about 40 percent of all contested elections at the state and national level in the U.S., which included 3,000 political campaigns. Using such software it's easier in the U.S. than Europe, where comprehensive data protection and privacy laws are in effect since 2018. Scottish National Party was the first political party to use NationBuilder, prompting astonishment among journalists, who did not expect to \\"see the voting intentions of millions of people hoarded in extraordinary detail.\\"  Funding  Investors in the NationBuilder include Chris Hughes - the Facebook co-founder, Sean Parker - first president of Facebook and co-founder of Napster and Causes, Dan Senor - the former Republican foreign-policy adviser and Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz. In 2012, it has raised $6.3 million in funding from a number of investors. NationBuilder received more than $1 million in 2018, from political entities including Donald J. Trump for President, Prosperity Action and the Republican Party of Tennessee.  Notable use cases  The software is reported to have played a role in some prominent public elections in Europe, the US and New Zealand.

Black End flew with the speed of 170 km/h and fought using its scissor tail, retractable horns and flames exhaled from its mouth. =Jackal= is the antagonist of 1975 manga, The Ultraman, illustrated by Mamoru Uchiyama. The leader of the eponymous , Jackal was banished into the black hole by Ultraman King for his crimes against the universe. Unfortunately, the black hole itself empowers Jackal long enough for him to escape and lead his army in an attempted genocide against the Ultra Warriors, forcing the survivors to take refuge on Earth. On Earth, members of the Jackal Army try to force Zoffy into surrendering himself, but the recent arrival of Melos turn the tides of the battle and lead the surviving Ultras into storming Planet Jackal and attacked their leader. The Demon King Jackal managed to defeat Melos by feigning surrender but Zoffy dons the Cosmo Techtor to mislead the Jackal Army, allowing Mother of Ultra to revive the fallen Ultra Brothers and obliterate the Demon King. With peace returning to the universe, the surviving Jackal Army ceased fighting and surrender themselves. The Demon King Jackal is capable of assuming various forms to assassinate the Ultra Warriors; Zetton in against Ultraman, Alien Nackle and Black King against Returned Ultraman, Ace Killer against Ace, Birdon against Taro and Zoffy against the Leo Brothers. As with all male characters, Demon King Jackal is voiced by Koichi Yamadera when The Ultraman was adapted into a 2015 short animation.

The financial district of Bonifacio Global City, the Fort Bonifacio military camp and the Manila American Cemetery are under the jurisdiction of the barangay. History During the American colonial period, the US government acquired a 25.78 square kilometre property within what was then disputed area between Makati, Taguig and Pateros for military purposes. This area (TCT dated 1902) was turned into a camp then known as Fort William McKinley after the 25th US president, William McKinley. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, the US bestowed to the Republic of the Philippines all rights of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of their military bases. On May 14, 1949, Fort McKinley was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of US Embassy Note No. 0570. Under the AFP leadership of Gen. Alfonso Arellano, Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed Fort Bonifacio,Barangay West Rembo Profile after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio, whose father, Santiago Bonifacio, was a native of Taguig (then part of the Province of Manila / Tondo).

During the American Commonwealth, it was converted to a Military base, named Fort McKinley. It was during the presidency of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos' administration when Fort McKinley was renamed Fort Bonifacio and transferred to Makati. Taguig got the jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio after winning the case against Makati in filed in the Pasig Regional Trial Court in 1993. Makati appealed the ruling, but the Pasig RTC in 2011 still sided with Taguig, saying that Fort Bonifacio including the -EMBO Baranggays are all part of Taguig. Makati then asked the Court of Appeals to review the case. The Court of Appeals overturned the Pasig Regional Trial Court's decision and reverted jurisdiction of the BGC in favor of Makati. As of date, Taguig has filed a Motion of Reconsideration at the Court of Appeals seeking to revert the decision. The newest Court of Appeals Resolution promulgated on October 03, 2017. In a 18-page resolution promulgated on March 8 penned by Associate Justice Edwin Sorongon and was concurred by Justices Ramon Cruz and Renato Franciso, the CA‚Äôs Special Former Sixth Division granted Taguig City‚Äôs motion to dismiss citing Makati‚Äôs violation of the forum shopping rule (or pursuing simultaneous remedies in two different courts) and accordingly dismissed the latter‚Äôs appeal of the earlier decision of the Pasig City Regional Trial Court (RTC) which originally ruled in favor of Taguig. http://services.ca.judiciary.gov.ph/casestatusinquiry- war/faces/jsp/view/ViewResultInformation.jsp?form1:tabSet1:tab1_submittedLink=form1:tabSet1:tab1 The CA took notice of the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on June 15, 2016 which found Makati guilty of ‚Äúwillful and deliberate forum shopping.‚Äù https://www.chanrobles.com/cralaw/2016junedecisions.php?id=498 ‚ÄúHowever, the Supreme Court has not spoken.

Description Ginataang manok is ideally made with native chickens (traditionally raised in Filipino backyards). It is first saut√©ed with garlic, onion, and ginger (or turmeric) until lightly browned. Coconut milk is then added along with vegetables like green papaya (or chayote), leafy vegetables (including pechay, spinach, moringa leaves, etc.), and peppers (usually bell peppers or siling haba). It is spiced with salt, pepper, and patis (fish sauce) or bagoong alamang (shrimp paste), and optionally, labuyo chilis. Coconut cream (kakang gata) is usually added shortly before it is cooked and simmered in low heat. The dish is very similar to tinola or binakol, except for the use of coconut milk. Variants A popular variant of ginataang manok is known as \\"Filipino chicken curry\\" or \\"Filipino-style chicken curry\\". It is cooked identically to ginataang manok, but adds curry powder or non-native Indian spices. It is also more likely to use potatoes or carrots in place of green papaya or chayote.

Hobrecht studied law at the Universities of K√∂nigsberg (Kaliningrad), Leipzig and Halle. From 1841 to 1844 he worked at courts in Elbing (ElblƒÖg), Graudenz (GrudziƒÖdz) and Marienwerder (Kwidzyn) in West Prussia and was deputy head of the district administration in Rybnik and Grottkau (Grodk√≥w) in Prussian Silesia from 1847 to 1849.

Mikhail Stepanovich Matiyasevich (Matiasevich) (Smolensk, May 23 [June 4] 1878 ‚Äì Kyiv, August 5, 1941) was a Soviet military commander, who commanded several military units of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War.  Biography  From the nobility of the Smolensk province, he fought in the Russo-Japanese War, as a lieutenant in the 220th Infantry Regiment. In the First World War, he fought on the Western and Northern fronts. He was wounded four times. Having become a Colonel in July 1916, he commanded the 717th Infantry Regiment. In the days of the October Revolution he was unanimously elected by the soldiers as commander of the Regiment. In February 1918 he was demobilized and apparently for ideological reasons, he voluntarily joined the Red Army in April 1918. He fought in the Russian civil war of 1918‚Äì1920, first at the head of the 1st Smolensk Infantry Division, then as commander of the right group of the 5th Army around Kazan and between November 14, 1918 and April 1919 at the head of the 26th Rifle Division. On July 1, 1919 he became Commander of the 7th Army and defended Petrograd against the White Northwestern Army of General Yudenich. Then he was moved to the Eastern front of the Red Army and on October 7, 1919 he was appointed commander of the 3rd Army, which pursued the retreating troops of Admiral Kolchak. After the capture of Omsk, the 3rd Army was disbanded and the 30th and 51st Divisions were transferred to the 5th Army. From February 8, 1920 to August 29, 1921, he was commander of the East Siberian Military District and the 5th Army, which destroyed the remains of Kolchak's troops, as well as the Asian division of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. After the War, he lectured at several schools, including the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, until he was arrested in 1931. He was sentenced to 10 years detention in a workcamp but was released 2 years later. Again arrested in 1937, he was released in 1940 \\"for lack of evidence\\". He died in Kyiv in August 1941, a month before its occupation by the Germans, aged 63. He was buried in the Lukyaniv cemetery of Kiev. Mikhail Matiyasevich during his lifetime didn't receive the deserved recognition and was unreasonably repressed. He never received the Order of the Red Banner.

After the 1911 San Feliu melee Junyent and Iglesias were accused in the Cortes of instigating violence, La Ma√±ana 01.06.11, available here For Junyent and Solferino the role of requet√© would be rather to guarantee \\"the free exercise by all citizens of their legitimate rights \\" and to be \\"a body of voluntary Civil Guards that only molests those who live from the booty of disorder, violence and anarchy\\".El Correo Catal√°n 11.7.15, quoted after Winston 2014, p. 86 If they managed to prevail and keep the hotheads in check it was only with great difficulty, and largely thanks to perfect relations with the new Carlist king, Don Jaime. Junyent travelled to Venice to greet the pretender when he assumed the claim,Manuel Polo y Peyrol√≥n, D.

Junyent maintained his trademark loyalty to Don Jaime; he took part in Magna Junta de Biarritz, a grand meeting supposed to set the party course for the future,Joan Mar√≠a Roma (ed.), Album hist√≥rico del carlismo, Barcelona 1933, p. 285 and for the second time was nominated the Catalan leader.Molas 2009, p. 10 Unlike the first brief episode, this time his string at the helm of regional Carlism would last 14 years.

As the Catalan regional jef√© Junyent issued a series of orders which warned the rank-and-file not to engage in official structures and introduced sort of internal party censorship, aimed to enforce united stand of the Catalan Carlist press; as director of El Correo Catal√°n and within limits permitted by censorship, he tried to propagate the same stand in his daily.Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, pp. 13-14 His own public activity was largely reduced to Traditionalist or religious gatherings, like celebrating Fiesta de Monarqu√≠a Tradicional;Diario de Valencia 09.01.24, available here in 1925 he led a large Carlist pilgrimage to Rome.La Cruz 28.10.25, available here However, in 1926 he was noted also as admitted by the minister of interior; neither the purpose not the outcome of the visit is known.La Libertad 11.02.26, available here Carlist standard There is scarce information on Junyent public activities of the second half of the 1920s; going on as the Carlist Catalan jef√©Costa i Fern√°ndez 1994, p. 407 he already received homages as a distinguished leaderEl Eco de Gerona 01.05.26, available here and remained among key nationwide party politicians meeting Don Jaime, e.g. during his visit to the claimant's residence in Frohsdorf.La Epoca 22.06.26, available here Traditionally steering clear of risky enterprises, in the late 1920s he intervened to defuse a plot to mount sort of a rising in Seu d‚ÄôUrgell, contemplated by some young Carlist hotheads.Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 19 Once dictatorship gave way to dictablanda he resumed efforts aimed at Catalan autonomy. When presidents of provincial Catalan diputaciones met in 1930 in what seemed like an effort to re-create Mancomunitat,Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 41 Junyent in El Correo claimed that the Catalan problem required \\"soluci√≥n integral y definitiva\\",\\"soluci√≥n integral y definitiva que reconozca la personalidad pol√≠tica y administrativa de las colectividades naturales e hist√≥ricas\\", quoted after Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 25 yet he did not fail to note that with own language, laws, flag and spirit, Catalonia \\"es espa√±ola porque es profundamente catalana\\".Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, pp. 42-43 In February 1931 he entered new comisi√≥n extraparlamentaria, supposed to work on an autonomy statute.La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 22.02.31, available here Republic (1931-1933) autonomy statute, 1932 Junyent greeted the advent of the Republic with far-reaching skepticism.

It was exacerbated by his comments about a possible fusion between two \\"ramas borb√≥nicas\\",El Siglo Futuro 23.11.31, available here even though at the time such concept was contemplated by the late Don Jaimeafter the fall of the monarchy in 1931 Junyent was confirmed by Don Jaime as the regional jefe, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 70; in a letter Don Jaime sent to Junyent in October 1931 he was reportedly optimistic about the future of Spain, La Epoca 02.10.31, available here.

Junyent responded with a letter titled La opini√≥n personal sobre la sucesi√≥n de la Corona de Espa√±a. The long discourse, starting with Felipe V, in principle did not deny heritage rights to the deposed Don Alfonso, but concluded that he had become undignified. The letter as such was inconclusive and did not point to any would-be successor of Don Alfonso Carlos. In terms of resolving the issue Junyent discouraged staging a grand Carlist meeting as he feared chaos and fragmentation; he rather suggested a meeting of regional jefes, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 278 yet since 1932 the fronde against him was on the rise, including booing at party rallies.El Siglo Futuro 30.06.32, available here His chief opponents, Conde de Valdellano and Jos√© Mar√≠a Cunill Postius, charged him with \\"concomitancia con los partidos liberales\\", \\"colaboracionismo con la pol√≠tica liberal\\"Alcal√° 2001, pp. 23-24 and \\"servilismo hacia los liberales\\";Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, pp. 136-137 further charges included Junyent's Catalanism and poor results in 1932 elections.Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 128 The campaign was well-prepared and some of the opponents travelled to France to win over the claimant.Alcal√° 2001, pp. 23-24 Junyent himself seemed tired and embittered; twice he tried to hand his resignation.Jos√© Carlos Clemente, El carlismo en el novecientos espa√±ol (1876-1936), Barcelona 1999, , p. 138 His third letter was finally accepted and in June 1933 Junyent ceased as the Catalan jef√©.some authors claim that Junyent resigned sensing that his dismssal was inevitable, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, pp. 136-137.

However, by some much younger Traditionalists he was considered authority; according to these accounts Junyent appreciated in particular the works of an early theorist, Mag√≠n Ferrer, Rod√≥n Guinjoan, Invierno, primavera y oto√±o del carlismo (1939-1976) [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 551, younger rodon invierno 551 in 1933 Don Alfonso Carlos asked him to preside over Junta Consultiva de la Regional de Catalu√±a,Clemente 1999, p. 138 a body which has probably never materialized, and in 1934 he was nominated to Consejo de Cultura Tradicionalista,Moral Roncal 2009, p. 122, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 208, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 163 a board of intellectuals supposed to act as guardians of ideological purity.

Biography  Ben-Menahem was born and raised in Bnei Brak, the eldest of three children. Her mother was born in Tel Aviv and her father in Slonim, Belarus. Her sister, Tami, is married to the Israeli journalist, Nahum Barnea. Ben-Menahem left school at the age of 15, to study jewelry making at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. She volunteered to Zahal at the age of 17, and served in the Air Force as a sports instructor. After her discharge from the army, Ben- Menahem returned to Jerusalem, and made a living from jewel making and writing pulp fiction stories. At the age of 20, she added the second name Rina to her birth name Sara, typically of her doing things her own way. It was during this period that she self-published her three books. Ben-Menahem moved to Ein Hod in the middle of the 1960s, where she lived with a woman in domestic partnership, continued to make jewelry and also painted and exhibited her paintings at a local gallery. Shortly afterwards, at the beginning of the 1970s, after separating from her partner, she left Israel for Amsterdam, and shunned from publicity. She died in Amsterdam in 2004. In October 2018, all three books were re-published in a single volume by Am Oved, by the initiative of her brother in law, Barnea.  Books  = ◊î◊ì◊ï◊ï◊ß◊ê◊ô◊ù = Self-published in Tel Aviv in 1960, under the Pseudonym .◊©.◊®.◊ë (S.R.B. ‚Äì created from the initials of her name), this book was uniquely first in its description of the homosexual and lesbian scene in Israel from first person acquaintance, rather than reporting about it as a problem. The book's name means \\"The Spiteful Doers\\", and is derived from the multi-faceted Yiddish and Hebrew word \\"davka\\" (Hebrew: ◊ì◊ï◊ï◊ß◊ê). The book consists of anecdotal stories in which the protagonist, a young woman named Yael, tells about her recognition of her lesbian sexuality and her coming out of the closet. The book was a huge success, but not for its literary qualities: shortly after its publication, the magazine HaOlam HaZeh published an article titled \\"The Wave of Lesbians in Israel\\" (Hebrew: ◊í◊ú ◊î◊ú◊°◊ë◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú), as part of that issue's sensational back cover story, titled \\"Special Report: The Lesbian Problem in Israel (Hebrew: \\"◊ì◊ï◊¥◊ó ◊û◊ô◊ï◊ó◊ì: ◊î◊ë◊¢◊ô◊î ◊î◊ú◊°◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú\\"), in which it included a few nit-picked erotic paragraphs from the book. The result, in the young and puritan State of Israel, was a storming of the book stores, with the first edition selling out within days. In an interview to the same magazine, two weeks after the first article, Ben-Mehahem told about her failed attempts to find a publisher for the book, and her saving penny to penny until she could afford to publish it herself. As the magazine hints, many details in the book are based on the author's personal experience. The book's cover was designed by Ben-Menahem herself, and includes a self portrait. = ◊î◊¶◊ú◊¢ ◊ê◊ï ◊ô◊ï◊û◊†◊î ◊©◊ú ◊î◊¶◊ú◊¢ ◊î-13 = Riding on the wave of the success of her first book, Ben-Menahem published her second book, \\"The Rib or The Diary of the 13th Rib\\" (1961, Bnei Brak). This book's protagonist, Hava, is a fictional Sephardi Jew, from the margins of society, who suffers triple discrimination ‚Äì as a Sephardi, as a woman and as a lesbian. She only discovers her lesbian tendency after her marriage. The book is written as a chronological diary, spanning 20 years of Hava's life, beginning in her adolescence in 1938, up to 1958, when she is a mother, dying of cancer. The biographical details are interspersed with descriptions and thoughts about real historical events of that period. = ◊î◊§◊®◊ó◊ó◊ô◊™ = Ben- Menahems third book, \\"The Whippersnapper\\" (January 1963, Tel Aviv), describes, like the second book, the life of a fictional Sephardi woman, this time from even more extreme margins of society, and her triple discrimination. This book, too, comes out blatantly against the discrimination of Sephardim by the Ashkenazi establishment hegemony.

He has been a leading researcher on the chemistry of the atmosphere with special focus on stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change, and air quality. His contributions have been significant in understanding ozone layer depletion, the role chemically active species play in climate change and the lifecycle of pollutants, specifically hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). He was part of the assessment steering committee (2006) of and co- chaired (2010 and 2014) the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Science Assessment Panel on Stratospheric Ozone. Education Ravishankara was born in Shimoga, India in 1949. He obtained his BSc and MSc degrees at the University of Mysore, and briefly researched at the Indian Institute of Science, before moving to the University of Florida at Gainesville where he received his PhD in 1975.  Career and research Ravishankara's work included fundamental research on chemical processes and reaction rates in the gas-phase and surface chemistry of the atmosphere of Earth, resulting in better comprehension of ozone depletion, climate change and air pollutants. Ravishankara began his career in atmospheric research after obtaining his Doctorate. He has researched Ozone Layer Depletion at Georgia Institute of Technology and in Antarctica. He participated in efforts to find alternatives to CFCs after the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. His work on fully fluorinated greenhouse gases contributed to the Kyoto Protocol agreement in 1997 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Ravishankara has also researched extensively on HFCs, work that was part of the efforts leading to the passage of the Montreal Protocol‚Äôs 2016 Kigali Amendment, aimed at reducing the use of HFCs specifically. In 2004, an NOAA team headed by Ravishankara, and two other independent teams, published a significant update of the rate coefficients for airborne chemical reactions. Earlier values were resulting in inaccurate measurement of, amongst other processes, atomic Oxygen reactions, created by the break-down of Ozone. Using laser flash photolysis, the groups studied the reaction kinetics of atomic oxygen with oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen molecules as well as greenhouse gases. Results indicated that the actual rate coefficient values were 20 percent higher than the estimates used by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and NASA at the time. Following research conducted by a team led by him, Ravishankara also drew attention in 2009 to the threat of nitrous oxide to the Ozone layer. In a paper published by the team in Science magazine, their research indicated a steady rise in nitrous oxide emissions by processes arising from human activity like agricultural fertilization and fossil fuel combustion. Ravishankara was senior scientist and then director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Chemical Sciences Division in Boulder, Colorado. =Appointments held= His appointments held include: *1976 Research Associate, University of Maryland *1976-1985 Research positions at Georgia Institute of Technology *1979-1985 Head of Molecular Sciences Branch, Georgia Institute of Technology *1984-2014 Research positions at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) *1989-2014 Adjunt Professor of Chemistry, University of Colorado *1993-2007 Chief of Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics Program, NOAA *2006-2014 Acting Director and then Director, Chemical Sciences Division, NOAA *2014-2016 Professor of Chemistry and Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University - Fort Collins =Awards and Honors= His awards and honors include: *1995 Silver Medal, United States Department of Commerce *1996 Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award of the US Environmental Protection Agency *1997 Fellow, American Geophysical Union *1998 Polanyi Medal of the Royal Society of Chemistry *1999 Robertson Memorial Lecturer, US National Academy of Sciences *2000 Member, US National Academy of Sciences *2001 Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science *2003 Crawford Lecture, University of Minnesota *2003 Centenary Lecture, Royal Society of Chemistry *2004 US Presidential Rank Meritorious Award for a senior professional *2005 Award for Creative Advances in Environmental Sciences, American Chemical Society *2005 Chancellor Lecturer, Louisiana State University *2005 Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC) *2007 Bronze Medal, United States Department of Commerce *2008 Bronze Medal, United States Department of Commerce *2008 Administrator‚Äôs Award, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration *2008 Fellow, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry *2008 Centenary Lecturer, Indian Institute of Science *2009 Welch Foundation Lecturer, Texas *2009 Morino Foundation Fellow, Japan *2010 Hinshelwood Lecturer, University of Oxford *2008 Bronze Medal, United States Department of Commerce *2013 Harold Schiff Lecture, York University, Canada *2013 Randall Lecture, University of Texas at Arlington, Texas *2019 Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS)  References  1949 births Living people Foreign Members of the Royal Society Fellows of the American Geophysical Union Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellows of the Royal Society of Chemistry ","title":"Akkihebbal Ravishankara"},{"id":"60539485","text":"Chandra Kumari Gurung is a former Nepali migrant worker in South Korea who in November 1993 was mistaken to be mentally ill and incarcerated in a South Korean psychiatric hospital for six years and four months.

It is situated along Palayamparambu Road, at Sampaloor, Mala in Thrissur district of the south Indian state of Kerala. The church is best known for hosting a number of Christian saints and missionaries including Francis Xavier, John de Britto, Arnos Pathiri and Constanzo Beschi.  Overview  Xavier's Castle Sampaloor, the place where the church is located, had a number of missionary visitors in its history, starting with Francis Xavier, who visited the village first in 1942, followed by two more visits in 1544 and 1548. The name of the village, prior to the arrival of Francis Xavier was Ambazhakad, and the concentration of Jesuit population in the village started in 1600s when they had to flee Kochi after the Dutch asserted their supremacy in Kochi. The Jesuits relocated the St. Paul's Seminary at Kochi to Ambalakkad and called the place, s√£o(n)-paulo(u)-ur, meaning the land of S√£o Paulo (St. Paul), to honour the memory of Paul the Apostle. Another Catholic saint, John de Britto visited the place, estimated to be in 1673-74, followed by Constantine Joseph Beschi, alternatively known as Veera Mamunyar, an Italian missionary and the author of Thembavani, whose resting place is by the church. It was to the St. Paul's Seminary in Sampaloor, the German Jesuit priest and missionary, Johann Ernst Hanxleden, better identified as Arnos Pathiri, came after his novitiate studies in Goa. While continuing his ecclesiastical studies, Pathiri studied Sanskrit and Malayalam while staying at Sampaloor and was ordained as a priest at this church. The church was destroyed during the invasion of Malabar by Tippu Sultan in 1781, and a new church was constructed in its place by Bernadian Bechinelly, the then vicar apostolate of Varapuzha in 1862 which was renovated twice, in 1893 and 1970 and the present church getting consecrated on 2 December 1979. The church complex, besides St. Paul's seminary, is home to St. Paul's Press and St. Paul's Monastery and it was at this press which was established in 1663, many of the early publications of Jesuit priests in the area were printed, including the first text in Malayalam. The church premises also hold two museums, Historicum Museum and Anglo-Indian Cultural Museum and several exhibits such as cannon balls used by Tippu Sultan during the invasion, lamps, vestments, tablets and statues are displayed in these museums.

Plot Yuichi Ishii runs a business called Family Romance, which serves as an agency to provide rental people to fill in as husbands, friends or other social roles. In doing so, they aim to fill the gaps in people‚Äôs lives helping them through challenging problems. At the film‚Äôs outset, Yuichi is fulfilling a contract where he pretends to be the father of 12-year-old Mahiro. Mahiro, who has no memories of her father, is shy and uncertain of Yuichi but slowly begins to welcome him into her life. As Yuichi gains her confidence, Mahiro‚Äôs mother asks for information about what her daughter is thinking and saying. As Yuichi grows closer to Mahiro, he begins to guard her secrets and advocate for more freedoms for her. In between his visits with Mahiro, Yuichi maintains his business. He accepts jobs and continues to fulfill them without any judgement towards his clients. While he completes his contracts, Yuichi considers the nature of artifice and reality after visiting a hotel staffed by robots. Yuichi confides in a friend that he has been having disturbing dreams of actors portraying samurai committing ritual suicide. Eventually Yuichi travels with Mahiro‚Äôs mother to visit an oracle. During their trip, Mahiro‚Äôs mother remarks that she is glad to have him as a friend. This makes Yuichi uncomfortable and after their trip he visits a funeral home where he inquires about the possibility of having actors in coffins. After another visit with Mahiro where she confesses that she loves him and wants to start spending weekends with him as father and daughter, Yuichi informs her mother that it has become too serious and they need to end their contract. Mahiro‚Äôs mother invites him to live with them, but Yuichi refuses and apologizes once more before leaving and suggesting that she rent a funeral for the imaginary father. Yuichi visits his friend, who consoles him and tells him that he believes Family Romance offers a helpful and meaningful service. Yuichi seems unconvinced and wonders if his own family could be rented people who are faking their emotions for him. The film closes with Yuichi returning to his own home. As he approaches he hears voices inside and a small set of children‚Äôs hands press against frosted glass on the front door. Yuichi hides from the unseen child and slumps next to the door.

Together with other smaller redoubts and batteries that also had the Subserra name, it was built during the Peninsular War (1807-14) as part of the first line of defence of the Lines of Torres Vedras planned by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington to protect the Portuguese capital of Lisbon and, if necessary, his own retreat. History At the beginning of the Peninsular War, France and Spain signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau in October 1807. This provided for the invasion and subsequent division of Portuguese territory into three kingdoms. Following this, French troops under the command of General Junot entered Portugal, which requested support from the British. In July 1808 troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, at the time known as Arthur Wellesley, landed in Portugal and defeated French troops at the Battles of Roli√ßa and Vimeiro. This forced Junot to negotiate the Convention of Cintra, which led to the evacuation of the French army from Portugal. In March 1809, Marshal Soult led a new French expedition that advanced south to the city of Porto before being repulsed by Portuguese-British troops and forced to withdraw. After this retreat, Wellesley's forces defeated the French again at the Battle of Talavera. Despite this victory Wellington realised that he was seriously outnumbered by the French army, and that he could be forced to retreat and possibly evacuate. He decided to strengthen the defences to the north of Lisbon by taking advantage of the hilly topography of that area. In October 1809, he ordered the building of the Lines of Torres as a system of fortifications, redoubts, escarpments, dams and other interventions. In total there were 152 works, which were all numbered and the Fort of Subserra was No. 114. It was a small, irregular pentagonal earthwork, well capped with stone, much of which is still visible. Construction began in February 1810 and it was finished within a few weeks. The fort was equipped with one six-pounder cannon and two nine-pounders for the three embrasures, as well as other artillery pieces. From October of that year it had a garrison of 100 Portuguese militia and gunners under the overall command of General Rowland Hill. Its objective was to defend the left flank of the S√£o Fernando Battery (No. 4) and to cross fire with the New Subserra Battery, close by, thereby protecting the road that went from Arruda dos Vinhos to Alhandra through the Subserra Valley. The monument to the Lines of Torres Vedras The fort is close to a monument commemorating the role of the Torres Vedras Lines in the victory of the Anglo-Portuguese troops over the French armies. Built on the site of the Boavista redoubt (originally numbered as work No. 3), construction was finished in 1883. It takes the form of a column, topped by a statue of the classical Greek figure of Hercules. In 1911, two plaques were added to acknowledge the contributions of Sir Richard Fletcher, who supervised the construction of the Lines, and of Jos√© Maria das Neves Costa, on whose original topographic maps Wellington based his plans for the Lines.

According to the USGS, this peak is \\"named for a local climbing club\\" that was \\"active in the area since the 1950s.\\" In the 1953, a Tibetan-born Sherpa named Tenzing Norgay was the first to summit Mt. Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary. The nearest higher peak is Mount Stuart, to the west, and Argonaut Peak lies to the east. The Sherpa Glacier lies on the northern slope of the peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains north into Mountaineer Creek, a tributary of Icicle Creek, or south into Ingalls Creek, all of which winds up in the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Sherpa Peak is situated in part of the Mount Stuart batholith, a large area of clean granite rock that forms the Stuart Range. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

After completing his education at Charterhouse, he served in the First World War with the Royal Garrison Artillery, enlisting as a second lieutenant in October 1916. After the war, he attended Pembroke College, Cambridge. He graduated from Pembroke in 1922, upon which he reenlisted with the Royal Artillery. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in September 1922. He was seconded to the Experimental Establishment at Shoeburyness in April 1924. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team against the Royal Navy at Lord's in 1925, before making a second first-class appearance for the Army against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1926. He scored a total of 25 runs in his two matches, as well as taking 6 wickets with best figures of 4 for 39. He returned to the Royal Artillery in February 1928, and attended the Gunnery Staff Course in September 1929, during which he was promoted to the rank of captain in June 1930. He returned the Royal Artillery in January 1931, but was seconded to the Pembroke Royal Garrison Artillery as an adjutant in November 1932. He transferred to the Glamorgan Royal Garrison Artillery in December 1933. He returned to Shoeburyness in November 1936, and by August 1938 held the rank of major.

The Hawick Sevens tournament started in 1886 and is the third extant oldest Sevens tournament in the world; behind Melrose Sevens (1883) and Gala Sevens (1884). Usually held around the end of every April, the tournament is part of the Kings of the Sevens competition. 2019's Hawick Sevens took place on the 20 April. The final was won by Boroughmuirhttps://twitter.com/KingsOf7s/status/1119661005003481088 For the 2019-20 season the tournament will instead move to an August fixture. This was played on 10 August 2019. The disassociated Hawick & Wilton Sevens started in 1885. These were run by Hawick and Wilton RFC - a cricket club that branched out to rugby union and was the progenitor of the Hawick RFC club - on separate dates from the Hawick Sevens tournament.

Published London by Dean & Son Limited, 160a Fleet Street, London E.C. He was also a County Alderman for Cumberland and an Honorary Colonel of the Westmoreland and Cumberland Yeomanry Cavalry. He was the fourth Baronet of Hutton and the first cousin of Sir Francis Vane. Life Henry Ralph Fletcher Vane was born on 13 January 1830, educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, and succeeded his father to the baronetcy in 1842 at the tender age of 12. In 1852 it was rumoured that Sir Henry was amorously involved with Isabella Henrietta Theodora Long, the granddaughter of Horatio Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford:Durham County Advertiser, 15 October 1852 > It is stated that a marriage is on the tapis between Sir Harry Vane, Bart., > of Hutton hall and Armathwaite, Cumberland, and Isabella Henrietta Theodora, > youngest daughter of Henry Lawes Long, Esq., of Hampton Lodge, Surrey, and > the Lady Catherine Long. In 1871, at the age of 41, Sir Henry married Margaret Maxwell Gladstone at Glencairn in Dumfries, Scotland.Scotland, Select Marriages, 1561‚Äì1910 Margaret was the daughter of Thomas Steuart Gladstone Esq., of Capenoch, co. Dumfries;The Times, 17 June 1908, p.11 Thomas Gladstone was the eldest son of the Liverpool based merchant and plantation owner, Robert Gladstone, and his wife, Catherine (n√©e Steuart); he was also the first cousin of Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister who was a contemporary of Sir Henry's uncle at Eton. In 1835, Thomas and two of his brothers, Robert and William, became the trustees and executors of their father's will and guardians of their younger siblings. He was responsible for managing the Jamaican properties and plantations and for dividing the estate equally between the siblings. In his own right, Thomas Gladstone was a merchant and broker in the Liverpool firm of Gladstone and Sergeantson through which he expanded his commercial interests into South American Guano, Australian farming as well as trade with Asia. In later life he retired to Capenoch house, Dumfriesshire. His younger brother Adam Steuart Gladstone became an East India merchant. In 1872, shortly after his marriage, Sir Henry Ralph Fletcher Vane was embroiled in unpleasant litigation. The litigation was initiated by his uncle, Frederick Henry Vane, the youngest son of his grandfather, Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane, 2nd Baronet. Ironically, Sir Henry may have met his wife through the introduction of Frederick Henry Vane who had been at Eton with William Ewart Gladstone. An account of the beginning of this dispute is contained in the memoirs of Frederick Henry Vane's son, Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher Vane, later 5th Baronet: > Somewhere in the later ‚Äòsixties arose the family dispute which, owing to the > bad advice of the lawyers on both sides, caused my father and his nephew, > Sir Henry, to enter into a trial lasting many years. Without hesitation it > can be said that unnecessary and extremely expensive litigation has been the > curse of my life, my ‚Äúthorn in the flesh‚Äù. To this day, in 1928, I suffer > from the effects of this lawyer-made dispute. The two were honourable > gentlemen, my father and my cousin, [and] would never have come to legal > blows had they not been egged on by their respective solicitors, both of > whom eventually committed suicide after it having been proved that they had > defrauded widows and orphans‚Äô. The litigation was first reported in The Times on 6 November 1872.The Times, Wednesday, Nov 1806, p.11; Issue 27527, col A The spoils at stake were the family estates in Cumberland and Westmoreland. The case made by the bill was that Sir Francis Fletcher Vane, 3rd Baronet, had been born out of wedlock. There are two accounts of this circumstance of his birth. In The Times: > It was upon the legitimacy of the third of these children that the question > turned. The plaintiff alleged that pending arrangements for his father's > marriage with Miss Bowerbank, she was prematurely confined of a third child, > a son, and that the marriage did not in fact take place until nearly three > weeks after her confinement ‚Äì viz., on march 9, 1797. The child thus born, > as the plaintiff alleged about three weeks before the marriage on the 9th of > March, was baptised by the name of Francis Fletcher Vane at St. George's, > Bloomsbury, on the 19th of April, 1797, and in the entry of his baptism he > was stated to have been born on the 29th of March 1797. As to this entry, it > was alleged by the plaintiff [Frederick Henry Vane] that the register had > been tampered with and that the date of the birth was added some time after > the original entry. The bill then stated that Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane > brought up Francis Fletcher Vane, the child thus born, as his legitimate > heir. After the marriage two other children were born ‚Äì i.e., a daughter, > and the plaintiff, who was born on May 10, 1807. Francis Fletcher Vane > married in 1823, and upon the death of his father in 1832 assumed the title > and the family estates. In his memoirs, Sir Francis (5th Bt) provides a more fanciful account of the birth of his uncle, Sir Francis (3rd Bt):Agin The Governments. Memoirs and adventures of Sir Francis Fletcher Vane Bt. Published London by Sampson, Low, Marston & Co., Ltd., 1930 > When the third [child of Sir Frederick and Hannah Bowerbank] was about to be > born, Sir Frederick repented and decided to marry his mistress, and not > wishing to have this ceremony performed in Cumberland, took her up to > London. On Bushey Heath they were attacked by highwaymen, he shot one of > them, the others flying-but the result of this shock caused premature > confinement, which happened at the house of a doctor at Watford. The above account is not corroborated by any of the extant law reports of the trial. In the 1881 census, Sir Henry and his wife were living at 35 Cadogan Place in Chelsea, London where he describes his occupation as magistrate,England Census, 1881and in the 1891 census he was living in Brighton.England Census, 1891 Debrett's Baronetage of 1905 states Sir Henry's seats as Hutton in the Forest and Scarness Cottage in Bassenthwaite. He was by then a member of the Carlton Club and Arthur's. Sir Henry Ralph Vane died at Hutton in the Forest on 15 June 1908 and probate was granted in Carlisle on 7 August 1908 to the Right Honourable Henry de Vere Vane, Baron Barnard, the Hon. William Lyonel Vane and Edward Lamb Waugh. England and Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858‚Äì1966 Sir Henry's effects were valued at ¬£107,747 or ¬£11,662,072 in 2015 prices.Bank of England Inflation Calculator The executors of the estate were as follows: ‚Ä¢ The Rt.

Debrett's Baronetage, Knightage and Companionage, 1905 The litigation challenging Sir Henry Ralph Vane's legitimacy to the Hutton estates was conducted in the 1870s and was prosecuted by Francis's father. At that time, it is not clear to what extent the litigation would cost Francis his inheritance. Certainly, the literature of Hutton in the Forest makes no mention of Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher Vane, 5th Baronet. An article in The Times dated 10 October 1912 states the following:The Times, 10 October 1912, p.18 > The debtor [Sir Francis Fletcher Vane] was also entitled, in the discretion > of the trustees of the will of the late Sir Henry Ralph Vane, and upon the > death of the Dowager Lady Vane and of Colonel Wing, a nephew of the > testator, to a life interest, not exceeding ¬£500 a year, charged upon the > Vane estates; and, under the resettlement of the estates in 1907, to a life > interest in reversion in the whole of the income contingent upon his > surviving the Dowager Lady Vane and Colonel Wing. Sir Francis Fletcher Vane did survive the Dowager Lady Vane (widow of the 4th Baronet), who died at Scarness Cottage in Bassenthwaite in 1916, and he survived Major-General Frederick Drummond Vincent Wing CB, who was killed in action during the Great War in 1915. In terms of the executors, Edward Lamb Waugh died on 27 October 1917, Henry de Vere Vane died on 28 December 1918 and William Lyonel Vane died on 23 January 1920. In 1931, the Hutton estates were gifted to William Fletcher-Vane, 1st Baron Inglewood, three years before the death of Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher Vane, 5th Bt.Hutton in the Forest Guide Book References 1830 births  1908 deaths  People educated at Eton College  Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford High Sheriffs of Cumberland Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom ","title":"Sir Henry Ralph Fletcher-Vane, 4th Baronet"},{"id":"60540745","text":"Senkashor () is a rural locality (a village) in Oshibskoye Rural Settlement, Kudymkarsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

Albrecht De Vriendt, Antwerp, J.-E. Buschmann, 1901 (Ghent, 8 December 1843 ‚Äì Antwerp, 14 October 1900) was a Belgian painter known for his genre scenes, history paintings, interiors and figure paintings.Albert De Vriendt at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was also active as an author, publisher and copyist He was also a watercolorist and an etcher.Judith Ogonovszky-Steffens, Albert De Vriendt in: Dictionnaire des peintres belges He participated in the monumentalist movement in Belgium and continued the tradition of the Belgian Romantic-historical school long after it had been abandoned in his country and abroad.Hugh Dunthorne, Michael Wintle, 'The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Britain and the Low Countries', Brill, 1 November 2012, p. 192-193 He was the brother of the painter Juliaan De Vriendt with whom he often collaborated on decorative projects. He was a director of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp. Life Albrecht De Vriendt was the son of decorative painter Jan Bernard (Jean) de Vriendt (1809-1868) and Anna Rosalia Ghiert. His father was a decorative painter mainly known for landscapes and still lifes.Jean Bernard De Vriendt at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Albrecht's two-year older brother Juliaan De Vriendt and three-year older sister Clementine De Vriendt also became painters. He and his siblings were initially trained by their father who conveyed his interest in Flemish art and language to his children. From an early age he assisted his father in some of his decorative projects. From 1861 he exhibited some of his early works. In 1865 he moved to Antwerp where his brother was already living. Here he studied under the painter Victor Lagye. During his time in Antwerp he came under the influence of the pre-eminent history painter of Belgium of that time Jan August Hendrik Leys.E. WANTE, \\"Albrecht de Vriendt\\", Dietsche Warande en Belfort, 1 (1900), 482-492 The annual fair After a brief return to Ghent Albrecht moved to Brussels where he settled down. Here he married in 1880 Laure Fi√©v√©. The couple had five children. With his brother Juliaan he made a number of journeys. In 1869 they visited Germany. In 1880 Albrecht traveled to Italy. That same year the brothers journeyed through Egypt and Palestine. Numerous studies, watercolors and pastel drawings of all kinds and sizes, as well as a faithfully executed and a jointly executed panorama, entitled The Death of Christ, were the fruits of this journey. In the meantime Albrecht‚Äôs artistic reputation grew. The artist was a member of various academies and societies. He also received several honors. His works were acquired by museums in Belgium and abroad including the In 1894 he was made a commander of the Order of Leopold, great officer of the Order of Isabella the Catholic and commander of the Order of Merit of Saint Michael. Albrecht was also appointed member of the provincial commission of the Royal Commission of Monuments and in that position he advised on public artistic projects. The brothers Albrecht and Juliaan shared a house in which they both had a studio. This physical closeness likely explains the stylistic similarity between the work of the two brothers. The death wake of St Cecilia After the death of Charles Verlat, Albrecht De Vriendt was appointed in 1891 as director of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp. In 1894 he was appointed professor of the National Higher Institute for Fine Arts Antwerp which had been established in 1885 as a post-graduate program in arts. Albrecht dedicated himself to his academic functions. From the mid-1850s the Belgian government began to promote monumental art in Belgium. It provided financial assistance to artists on various projects. The promotion of monumental art dealing with episodes from the Belgian national history was regarded by the government of the young Belgian state as an important means of creating a national identity. The Belgian prime minister Charles Rogier was in particular in support of this movement. Jean-Fran√ßois Portaels and Jean Baptiste van Eycken, both pupils of Fran√ßois-Joseph Navez, helped launch the monumentalism movement in Belgium. They did this by introducing into Belgium new fresco techniques such as water glass painting, which they had studied abroad.'Water-glass painting' in Oxford Reference The monumentalism movement was subsequently taken up by artists such as Jan Swerts and Godfried Guffens who had learned about the movement in Germany. Albrecht de Vriendt and his brother Juliaan also participated in the monumental art movement. One of the projects they worked on was the decoration of the Gothic room in the town hall of Bruges, a work that after his death was completed by his son Samuel De Vriendt and his brother Juliaan. In his role as a member of the provincial commission of the Royal Commission of Monuments he also regularly advised on various projects for the renovation of monuments in Belgium.Anna Bergmans, Middeleeuwse muurschilderingen in de 19de eeuw: studie en inventaris van middeleeuwse muurschilderingen in Belgische kerken, Leuven University Press, 1998, pp. 20-21 When he died in 1900, his brother succeeded him in the position of director the Antwerp Academy. Among his students were Pieter Franciscus Dierckx, Frans Mortelmans, Isidoor Opsomer, Jan Brouwer Bogaerts, Willem van Barend Dort (sr.) , Albert Geudens, Gerrit David Gratama, Georges Lemmers, Simon Maris, Johan Sikemeier, Piet Slager (jr.), Julien Stappers, Hendrik Jan Wolter, Jacques Zon and Emile Rommelaere. Work Pope Paul III for the portrait of Luther Albrecht De Vriendt was a painter of genre scenes, religious subjects, history paintings, interiors and figure paintings. He was also a watercolorist and an etcher. Albrecht De Vriendt principal subject matter was the glorious Belgian and Flemish history from the 15th to 17th centuries. He thus continued the tradition of the Belgian Romantic- historical school who chose as the subject matter of their work important historical events in Belgium‚Äôs history which were regarded as key to the country‚Äôs national identity. The movement had started in the 1830s with painters such as Gustave Wappers, Louis Gallait, Ernest Slingeneyer, Nicaise de Keyser and other minor figures who had typically trained in Paris where they had come into contact with the new Romantic movement. Unlike their French models such as Delacroix, their work, though colourful, lacked true romantic zest and was quickly recuperated by the establishment which rewarded the artists with commissions and rewards.Johan Decavele, et al. \\"Belgium.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 Feb. 2014. An example of his work in this genre is Philip I conferring the Order of the Golden Fleece on his son Charles (1880, Brooklyn Museum) painted on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the independence of Belgium. De Vriendt used an event from Belgium's glorious to help create the notion of a distinctive heritage and cultural identity for the young Belgian nation. In this work De Vriendt depicts a lavish court room in which Philip the Handsome (1478‚Äì1506) bestows the Order of the Golden Fleece on his one-year-old son, Charles (1500‚Äì1558), who had been born in Ghent (De Vriendt's native town). Charles later became the most powerful ruler of Europe. De Vriendt demonstrates in this work his skill in the rendering of fabrics as well as a sensitivity in depicting the confused expression of the infant Charles.Albrecht de Vriendt, Philip I, the Handsome, Conferring the Order of the Golden Fleece on his Son Charles of Luxembourg at the Brooklyn Museum Gallery Brooklyn Museum - Philip I, the Handsome, Conferring the Order of the Golden Fleece on his Son Charles of Luxembourg - Albrecht de Vriendt.jpgPhilip I conferring the Order of the Golden Fleece on his son Charles File:Albrecht De Vriendt - The painter Jan van Eyck.jpgThe painter Jan van Eyck File:Albrecht De Vriendt - 15th century court game.JpegFifteenth century court game File:Albrecht De Vriendt - His move.jpegHis move References External links * 1843 births 1900 deaths 19th-century Belgian painters Belgian history painters Belgian genre painters Artists from Antwerp People from Ghent ","title":"Albrecht De Vriendt"},{"id":"60540813","text":"Silina () is the name of several rural localities in Russia: *Silina (Beloyevskoye Rural Settlement), Kudymkarsky District, Perm Krai, a village in Kudymkarsky District, Perm Krai *Silina (Verkh-Invenskoye Rural Settlement), Kudymkarsky District, Perm Krai, a village in Kudymkarsky District, Perm Krai ","title":"Silina"},{"id":"60540818","text":"Silina () is a rural locality (a village) in Beloyevskoye Rural Settlement, Kudymkarsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

Description  The J-shaped coral island has an area of , length of approximately , with approximately of shoreline. The island has a low elevation, mostly less than , and is part of the Morning Reef complex composed of coral shingle. The surface is mostly sandy but has some pockets of guano and some exposed coral.  History  The island is best known as the location of the wreck and mutiny. Batavia was wrecked on Morning Reef in June 1629. Most of the 316 passengers and crew were washed ashore on the smaller islands on the eastern side of the Wallabi Group. The commander, Francisco Pelsaert, and 47 other crew and passengers set off in one the longboats in search of water but ended up sailing to Indonesia. When Pelsaert returned to the Abrolhos he found that Batavias under-merchant, Jeronimus Cornelisz, had recruited other men from the survivors and then killed 125 of the other survivors. The mutineers camped on Beacon Island, and many of the victims were buried there. The island, along with the rest of the Abrolhos, was likely visited by sealers and guano miners through the 19th century. In 1877 survivors of the Hadda shipwreck lived on the island for five days. Crayfisherman arrived on the island sometime afterward and established several galvanised iron and asbestos shacks along with sheds for gear on four main sites. The first archaeological excavations were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, with the Western Australian Museum conducting excavations in 1992. There are two government buildings on the island; both were once utilised to support archaeological work and operations for the various Batavia sites. A public toilet for visitors is also found on the island. The island is on the National Heritage list due to it being the site to the Batavia shipwreck.  Birds  The island is part of the Houtman Abrolhos Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports large numbers of breeding seabirds. Birds that are found on the island include the wedge-tailed shearwater, which nests on the island between November and May.

Teiknib√≥k (Reykjav√≠k, Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar, AM 673 a III 4to) is an Icelandic manuscript of drawings used as models for manuscript illumination, painting, carving and metalwork. It is remarkable for being one of only three dozen books of its type which survive from Western Europe and the only example extant from medieval Scandinavia. The manuscript was produced over a period of over 150 years by four anonymous artists, beginning in around 1330. The illustrations in Teiknib√≥k resemble those in Kirkjub√¶jarb√≥k, and it may have served as a model for them. In the words of the manuscript's most recent editor Gu√∞bj√∂rg Kristj√°nsd√≥ttir, \\"The diverse subjects of the drawings prove that Icelandic art flourished to a far greater degree than surviving works of art would indicate.\\"  History and Description  The manuscript was given to √Årni Magn√∫sson along with two leaves from the Icelandic Physiologus dating to around 1200. The √Årni Mag√∫sson Institute in Iceland received the manuscript on 2 June 1991, which is in too poor a condition to be displayed permanently. 21 leaves and a fragment of the manuscript survive. The leaves measure between 170‚Äì180 mm by 127‚Äì135 mm. The condition of the manuscript is poor, affected by patches of rot and decay which has left holes in its pages. The illustrations themselves are faded and worn, and a number have been altered and others have been scribbled over. Four artists worked on the manuscript: Artist A (1330-1360) illustrated 15 sheets; Artist B (1360-1390) worked on 2 pages; Artist C (1450-1475) has left work on 22 pages; Artist D (c. 1500) is found on 8 pages. Battista suggests that the monastery at √ûingeyrar is a likely source for the manuscript. Artist A also illuminated other √ûingeyrar manuscripts including AM 227 fol. (Stj√≥rn). The iconographic imagery of Teiknib√≥k and the √ûingeyrar manuscripts AM 227 fol. and AM 249 e fol. shows influence from fourteenth century East Anglian manuscript illustration.

Mario P. Rivera serves as the current parish priest of the church. History The Santa Rosa de Lima Parish Church was built in the year 1792 with the arrival of Spanish Catholic priest, Francisco Favie. Both the church and the convent were completed within 12 years. It was blessed on August 4, 1812. The first Mass was held on August 30, 1812, in honor of the patron saint, Rose of Lima, with Fray Francisco Favie, O.P the first parish priest. In 1970, Spanish friars built the present church building with labor from China who later became descendants of the old Chinese families in Santa Rosa including the Lijauco's and the Tiongco's. The old convent is now the main building of the Canossa School. Instead of ‚ÄúBucol‚Äù, the residents chose to name the town ‚ÄúSanta Rosa.‚Äù The original building remains standing next to the Old Government Building and is known as Museo de Santa Rosa. Features =Bells= The bell tower of Santa Rosa de Lima Parish Church The church has eight big bells that toll with sounds heard in distant barrios. Each bell is identified with a saint: * Santa Rosa de Lima (the biggest bell) * Santa Barbara * Santissimo Sacramento * San Juan Bautista * San Jose * Santa Cecilia * Santo Domingo de Guzman *Ni√±o Jesus The patron‚Äôs name, the name of the manufacturer, and his address, the priest then serving as curate, the year of casting, and the name of the donor (if any) are engraved on the bell. =Clock of the Old Fa√ßade= The Church has a clock measuring in diameter that chimes every quarter hour. It was destroyed during a dogfight between the United States Air Force and the Imperial Japanese air forces, dismantling with it the statues of saints, specially those the church uses in processions during the Holy Week. =Paintings= The image of King David on the ceiling of the choir loft Fray Andres Tejedor (Oct. 1916 - Feb. 1926), a Spanish priest of the Dominican Order, inspired Mariano Perlas Sr., an indigenous Santa Rosa painter during the early 20th century, to paint the ceiling of the church. It was a great attraction from 1923 to 1960. Among the paintings were the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, the Coronation, the four Evangelists and Saint Roch. During the time of Father Agustin Reyes (1957-1966) the paintings were removed when the ceiling was repainted during the renovation of 1960 because some pictures had been defaced by bats and time. The two paintings on the ceiling of the choir loft or ‚ÄúKoro‚Äù, the image of the patron saints of Christian music ‚Äì Holy King David with the harp and Saint Cecilia at the piano, are the only remnants of the more than a dozen paintings. When Father Benito Pagsuyuin was the parish priest, some paintings that were rotting in the sacristy were assembled, and Dr. Pedro Rivera had them repainted. They were framed and displayed at the back part of the church.

History The site chosen for the hospital had previously been occupied by Victoria House, the former home of Benjamin Broadbent, a master builder. The hospital, which was designed by Edward Loney Stephens using a corridor layout with compact arrow additions, opened as the Leicester Borough Lunatic Asylum in September 1869. An extension to the male ward, designed by George Thomas Hine, was completed in 1883 and a corresponding extension to the female ward, also designed by Hine, was completed in 1890. A bath house, also designed by Hine, was added in 1913. The facility became the Leicester City Mental Hospital in the 1920s. Three detached villa properties, built in the 1930s, were made available to the Emergency Medical Service during the Second World War. The facility joined the National Health Service as the Towers Hospital in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in April 2013. The administration building, which became known as George Hine House, was converted for use as a Sikh free school in 2014. Several of the other buildings, including the original main block with superintendent's residence above, have been redeveloped for residential use.

It is a new telling of the Robin Hood legend. Some reviewers have noted the focus on socioeconomic class, as Robin lives among \\"the improverished 99%,\\" leading rebels who will overthrow the Sheriff, who lives in an Upper City housing \\"the wealthy citizens of Sherwood.\\" Others also noted the focus on class difference, with Robin and her comrades trying to \\"overcome inequality and fight for justice.\\" Apart from this, others said the series has a cyberpunk feeling to it. The show had a world premiere in Sydney, Australia, in March 2019. In April 2020, Sherwood was one of the originals that Google decided to make freely available in light of the pandemic. Premise In the year 2270, in the dystopic 23rd Century, 14 year old hacker Robin Loxley and her friends battle the Sheriff of Nottingham in a Britain devastated by environmental disaster. Cast and characters *Anya Chalotra as Robin Loxley *Tyler Posey as Iniko *Aneurin Barnard as Gisbourne *Jamie Chung as Rose Trefgarne *Rachel House as Tui *Adetokumboh M'Cormack as Gripper *Joseph Fiennes as Sheriff Nottingham *Darrill Rosen as Thomas Loxley *Neneh Conteh as Juba Production The idea for the series was originally posed by Diana Manson and Megan Laughton, of a New York company named Baby Octopus, in 2016, to Justin Trefgarne. Additionally, the show is, according to Trefgarne, aimed at \\"the pre-teen market,\\" and is focused \\"on positive female empowerment.\\" The production company, Baby Octopus, worked with the Computer Science in Media team of Google to help imagine \\"world of the future and what it meant for design, travel, technology and society,\\" and to inspire \\"young women and girls on their role in technology of the future.\\" Trefgarne, in a August 2018 post on his website, noted that he was commissioned to write the pilot script in 2016, with YouTube ordering nine additional episodes in January 2017, and continued production, with an original release date in November 2018. He also stated that the series is \\"inspired by the classic Manga Akira,\\" a Japanese cyberpunk manga series set in a post-apocalyptic and futuristic Neo-Tokyo, more than two decades after a mysterious explosion destroyed the city. In February 2019, a number of behind-the-scenes specials were released about the show. In the first one, on February 22, director Bruce Carter talked about the setting of the show in a futuristic London, which those in this story call \\"Sherwood,\\" with the story based around Robin and her \\"merry band\\" of followers. In the same special, executive producer Nanette Miles said that the show would inspire \\"lots of young girls,\\" production designer Daniel McKay called Robin a \\"tinkerer\\" who can easily adapt technology, and production coordinator Freya Walker Smith called her a \\"cool girl\\" who fights for herself and a \\"powerful heroine who can code.\\" In the second special, on February 26, music producers Jacob Yoffee and Roahn Hylton said they wanted to make the audience pay attention and listen to what is going on in the story, trying to make the world larger and feel more realistic. Yoffee also said that Bruce Carter, wanted a futuristic sound, with world music \\"more infused\\" into the mainstream and said they worked with Mickey Shiloh, on all the songs. Hylton also described Robin as a hero \\"everyone can get behind,\\" with her theme having a \\"superhero element\\" to it, plus a \\"bit of sadness\\" because she is searching \\"for her identity.\\" In the last special, on February 28, Anya Chalotra, who voices Robin, said that if she was 14, Robin would be her friend and would inspire (and empower) her. Chalotra further called Robin self-sufficient and dedicated to \\"making the world a better place\\" which is more equal, talked about the challenge of playing such a \\"complex character\\" and stated she \\"sets an amazing example of a young leader.\\" At the same time, Erin Rainaldi, a software engineer from Verily who works on the show, said that it's important to show that women and girls are just as good at \\"technology and tinkering\\" than boys, saying it sets an example for young girls, and Jamie Chung, who voices Rose, called Robin fun and a rebel, hoping the show does the same in speaking to young girls. Bernadette Carter, a software engineer from Google called Robin a \\"strong female lead,\\" not letting others tell her what to do, while balancing it with compassion for others, and is determined and dedicated to her goals. Episodes Reception Common Sense Media, a family-friendly media review site, gave the series an aggregate of three stars, stating its themes made it suitable for older viewers. Alexis Gunderson of Paste Magazine listed it as one of the 13 Best Original TV Shows on YouTube Premium in 2019. Gunderson said that while it may look similar to Star Wars: The Clone Wars, it is an original, with visually layered scenes and set in a \\"distressing believable\\" dystopia, while saying she appreciates it for its own merits, calling it a compelling family-friendly animation. Apart from this, in the show's first week on YouTube, the show's first episode garnered seven million views, something which series writer and developer, Trefgarne said he was delighted by.

She studies the functional traits of plants and investigates how plants impact the ecosystem. D√≠az is a senior member of the National Scientific and Technical Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences of Argentina. She is one of the top 1% most cited scientists in the world. She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2019. One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where:  Early life and education  D√≠az was born in Bell Ville in the province of C√≥rdoba, Argentina. Her parents loved plants and she grew up in a home with big gardens. D√≠az attended the National University of C√≥rdoba and graduated cum laude with a biology degree in 1984. She decided that she wanted to be an environmental scientist, and chose to pursue graduate research. She remained at National University of C√≥rdoba for her doctoral studies, earning a PhD in biological sciences in 1989. She worked with Marcelo Cabido and Alicia Acosta on plant functional traits. During her PhD and later research D√≠az developed the protocols to support scientists using functional traits to interpret ecosystems. D√≠az was a fellow at CONICET, the center for ecology and natural resources. Career and research After reading a book by J. Philip Grime about the connection between ecosystem processes and environmental factors, D√≠az applied to work with him in the United Kingdom. In 1991 D√≠az joined the University of Sheffield as a postdoctoral research associate. At Sheffield she studied how plant communities respond to increasing quantities of carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ). She was the first to demonstrate the impact of carbon dioxide on soils. She found that, even in the presence of fertilizer, weedy plants that grow quickly suffer from heightened levels of carbon dioxide. At the same time, microorganisms in the soil thrived in high levels of carbon dioxide indicating that there is a competition between plants and soil for nitrogen. Diaz also showed that slow-growing plants have a more positive feedback mechanism. D√≠az returned to Argentina in 1993, where she moved back into studying plant traits. She helped to prepare the South American contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). D√≠az founded the n√∫cleo diversus de investigaciones en diversidad y sustentabilidad. She has played an important role in the development and implementation of biodiversity. As part of CONICET D√≠az developed a new methodology to quantify the biodiversity of plants. This tool allows scientists to evaluate the effect of biodiversity of plants and the impact of ecosystems. D√≠az was the first to provide a global picture of the functional diversity of vascular plants. She designed a database of tens of thousands of plants, using contributions of 135 scientists. She explored functional trait diversity on plots of land, dividing vegetation into separate sections to simulate changes in climate and land use. She demonstrated that there exists a tradeoff in plant design between the fast acquisition of resources and the conservation of the resources in tissues. Plant designs can include the lifetime of their leaves, whether they grow quickly or slowly, how they reproduce and what kind of wood they have. D√≠az is also interested in social sciences, and looks at how societies value and support ecosystems. D√≠az is interested in the relationship between living plants and people. She published a mechanistic framework for connecting functional diversity in 2007, a paper which would go on to win the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) Cozzarelli Prize. She used this methodology in real-world systems, and assembled a team of social scientists and ecologists. Social scientists worked with communities to understand what they want from a particular ecosystem, and ecologists studied functional diversity and the relevant ecosystem processes. Clarivate Analytics reported that D√≠az was one of the most highly cited environmental scientists in the world. She is a leader on the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). IPBES consists of 150 scientists worldwide. She was listed as one of the ten people who mattered in science in 2019 by the journal Nature in their end of year review  Awards and honours  Diaz' awards and honours include: *2008 Ecological Society of America Sustainability Award *2008 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) Cozzarelli Prize *2013 Konex Platinum Award in Biology and Ecology *2014 Bernardo Houssay Award in Biological Sciences *2014 Honorary member award of the British Ecological Society (BES) *2017 Ramon Margalef Prize in Ecology * 2018 Nominated by Nature's 10 as one of five ones to watch in 2019. *2019 Princess of Asturias Awards *2019 Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) *2019 Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters Gunnerus Award  References  1961 births Living people Argentine women scientists National University of C√≥rdoba alumni National University of C√≥rdoba faculty Women ecologists Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Foreign Members of the Royal Society ","title":"Sandra D√≠az (ecologist)"},{"id":"60541489","text":"Pavel Frinta (born 13 August 1969) is a Czech wrestler.

As a result, the department is divided into four disivsion. Sometimes referred to by critics as the \\"political police\\", it is responsible for controlling subversive activities and serves as the Thai Police's major intelligence organization, as well as the unit responsible for VIP protection. History A Special Branch Bureau (SBB) division exists in the Royal Thai Police as part of its Crime Prevention and Suppression Support Group. Aside from intelligence gathering, they provide protection to VIPs alongside the Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB) and Armed Forces Security Centre. They handle matters that have to do with citizenship, such as the renunciation of Thai nationality. Foreign nationals living in Thailand go to the Special Branch office to secure a Thai police clearance certificate. Other cases such as l√®se majest√©, terrorism, and anything that endangers Thai national security are also handled by the Thai SBB. The SBB worked with the Malaysian Special Branch during the Cold War. During that time, SBB officers were involved in the Red Drum killings, in which 3,008 accused of being pro-communist were burned to death from red drums alive or semi-conscious and incinerated during the administration of Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn. The SBB was accused of human rights violations toward Falun Gong practitioners. They have been promoted as a means of routing political opposition to the government. The division stirred controversy in the run-up to the 2007 general election when media revealed that the SBB had conducted its own opinion poll to assess the probable electoral outcome. In response to similar stories before the 2011 general election, the SB characterised its gathering of data as a study rather than a poll. A special police unit called the \\"Black Tiger\\" is under the control of the Special Branch.

He was killed in a massacre in the Siege of Cawnpore in India, a key episode in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Biography Joseph Rooney was born in Athlumney, County Meath, the son of Lawrence Rooney. He studied Classics at the seminary in Navan, before attending All Hallows College in 1843, as the first student to enter. The college was set up by Meath-born priest John Hand, and Rooney studied to be a missionary priest. He was ordained in May 1847. The Apostolic vicar of Agra, North India, Joseph Borghi (1839-1849), wrote in 1846 to David Moriarty, president of All Hallows, asking for support: he needed priests to help support the needs of the soldiers there. The Vicariate of Agra encompassed a huge area including the North-Western Provinces, the Punjab, and the Indo- Gangetic Plain, and the Italian Capuchins there ministered to British troops. As a result, in September 1847 Rooney left for Agra, with Rev. Nicholas Barry, and they arrived the next year. Their first job was to assist in setting up schools there; after the establishment of St. Peter's College, Agra, and St Paul's Orphanage, they started the school \\"for the sons of officers and gentlemen\\" that later became St. George's College, Agra. Overworked, he was sent to Firozpur, and quickly became a favorite of the military personnel there; they had just sacked Multan Fort, and offered Rooney some of the silver and gold they had stolen, but he declined. Here also he suffered from exhaustion, and while he had permission to return home for a few years, he declined, asked for another mission, and was sent to Kanpur. Kanpur was the site of a large British garrison, and it became the target of a rebellion let by Nana Sahib, culminating in the 22-day Siege of Cawnpore. Rooney was killed during that siege (a 1930 sermon mentions he was hanged) after ministering to a wounded soldier on June 18, 1857. His death, as well as that of a priest who was killed in Delhi and one who was killed in Lucknow, was described by Monsignor Ignatius Persico, then Apostolic vicar of Agra, in an eyewitness account published in 1858. Persico had befriended Rooney in India, and later visited the ruins of his childhood home in Ireland. Family Rooney's younger brother, John Rooney, also studied at Navan and then at Maynooth University. Hand asked him to teach in All Hallows College, and in preparation for that position he studied for two years in Paris at the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice. At All Hallows he was appointed Professor of Theology and Sacred Scripture, and after ten years there, in 1863, became parish priest of Drumconrath.

The English version premiered on Nickelodeon Asia on 8 January 2020. Beginning with this season, the series was heavily retooled to appeal to a younger target audience. RainbowSpA's creative team restyled the characters to appear younger, and the plot lines were simplified. Most of the show's longtime crew members were not called back to work on this season, including art director Simone Borselli, who had designed the series' characters from season 1 to 7, and singer Elisa Rosselli, who had performed a majority of the songs. In another change from previous seasons, Nickelodeon's American team served as consultants rather than directly overseeing the episodes; at the time, Nickelodeon was instead working with RainbowSpA on a new series called Club 57. The American writers remained as consultants for season 8 and Nick's Pierluigi Gazzolo continued in his role as a director for RainbowSpA. Also during this season's production, series creator Iginio Straffi stepped away from focusing on the series. He shifted his concentration to other work with Nickelodeon, including Club 57, as well as a live-action adaptation of Winx Club aimed at an older audience. In 2019, Straffi explained his reasoning for gradually lowering the series' intended demographic: Synopsis The Winx Club notices that some of the stars in the sky are disappearing. They determine that the return of Valtor is linked to this strange occurrence. The fairies travel to Lumenia, the Magic Dimension's brightest star and the light source for Stella's home planet of Solaria. Lumenia's queen gives them the power of Cosmix to protect the magical universe's billions of stars. Along the way, the Winx also meet Twinkly; a helpful golden creature who powers the very core of Lumenia.

He has performed in more than 3,000 schools, theaters, conventions, libraries, and churches in America, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, Southeast Asia, and Central America. DeSpain has also been a featured storyteller at festivals across the US, including the National Storytelling Festival‚ÄúStorytelling: The National Festival‚Äù (LP Album) 1983. Pleasant DeSpain: ‚ÄòOld Joe and the Carpenter.‚Äô National Association for the Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling, Jonesborough, TN. in Jonesborough, Tennessee, Tucson's Tales of Arizona Festival, and Louisville's Corn Island Storytelling Festival where he performed for 16,000 people. Jimmy Neil Smith, the founder of the National Storytelling Festival (and the National Association for the Preservation and Perpetuation, which would later become the International Storytelling Center), refers to DeSpain as ‚Äúa pioneer of the American renaissance in storytelling.‚Äù After visiting 36 countries, DeSpain chose Thailand ‚Äì \\"the land of smiles\\" ‚Äì as his home base in 2017. Early life DeSpain was born in Denver, Colorado, the second son of Robert Alan and Eleanor Jane DeSpain. Early in his childhood, he learned to read and fell in love with books. \\"I wrote my first story in third grade. It was called 'The Mystery Artist.' I got in trouble because it was getting passed around the classroom... The teacher said, 'The story is good, but your spelling is terrible.'\\" Forty-five years later it was published in 1996 and sold more than 200,000 copies Education and teaching In 1961‚Äì1963 DeSpain attended Adams State College in Alamosa, Colorado. In 1965 he graduated from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale with a Bachelor of Arts in English and Public Speaking, continued his studies there, and earned a master's degree in Rhetoric and Public Address and the Oral Interpretation of Literature in 1966. In 1966 DeSpain started his educational career as a Speech Communication and Oral Literature instructor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. In 1968 he was granted a fellowship to study for a Ph.D. at the University of Colorado, Boulder. After two years of studying and teaching in Colorado, he left the doctorate program to begin his world travels. Nine months later, the University of Washington in Seattle invited DeSpain to become one of their faculty members. Multicultural storytelling career While sitting on a beach in Mexico at age 25, DeSpain decided that storytelling would be his life's work. \\"I came within six months of getting my Ph.D.,\\" he says. \\"Thank God I didn't. I had a dark night of the soul.\\" The road to success was not easy or quick. Pleasant worked as a house painter, short-order cook and dishwasher during the first five years as he followed his muse, but his trials were rewarded. \\"Storytelling, an art form as old as the human race, was being revived elsewhere around the country too. 'Twelve others were coming up with the same idea,' he remembers. 'We started hearing about each other and began to meet.'\\" In addition to oral storytelling at local venues, he wrote a weekly column featuring a wide range of stories for The Seattle Times. In 1975 he created Pleasant Journeys, a weekly storytelling television show for children, which aired on the NBC Seattle affiliate (KING TV), and was named ‚ÄúSeattle‚Äôs Resident Storyteller‚Äù by the city's mayor. DeSpain wrote, produced, and hosted the show for five years until 1980. During his storytelling career, DeSpain has traveled the world as he gathered traditional and true stories, and performed them along the way for audiences of all ages. ‚ÄúHe was wonderful,‚Äù says Kim McMann, head of children's services for the Troy Public Library. ‚ÄúHe told stories and wrapped everyone around his finger. We were on the edge of our seats.\\" Audiences are an essential component in his art, and DeSpain says, ‚ÄúThree elements ‚Äì story, listener, teller ‚Äì must come together as one during the experience.‚Äù In all of his stories, DeSpain delivers one central message: ‚ÄúMy main force in the telling and the writing is to point out in an entertaining way that we human beings are far more alike than we are different, no matter the culture, the time, the language, or the religion.‚Äù DeSpain is also enthusiastic about sharing the art of storytelling, and often follows up his school performances by teaching children how to tell their own stories. ‚ÄúWhat I love about storytelling as a career is that every one of us is a natural-born teller of tales. Our lives are our stories and when we share our stories, we share our lives.\\" Works DeSpain on the set of his storytelling television show \\"Pleasant Journeys\\" on KING-TV in Seattle during the 1970s =Folklore collections= *Pleasant Journeys, Twenty-Two Tales from Around the World, Vols. 1 & 2 (illus.

The book was published in the United Kingdom in April 2017 by Harvill Secker, and in the United States in November 2018 by Little, Brown and Company. It won Beard the 2018 PEN/Ackerley prize for a literary biography of excellence, and was also named a finalist for several other noted literary prizes including the National Book Critics Circle Award. Synopsis The book begins with the author at age eleven in 1978, swimming in the sea off Cornwall, England with his nine-year-old brother, Nicky. Out of sight of their parents and siblings, they suddenly find themselves dragged into an undertow and are quickly out of their depth. Richard realizes that he is about to die and struggles frantically to shore, leaving Nicky behind. His last view of his brother is of the younger boy straining to keep his head above water and whimpering. Although Richard runs for help, it is too late by the time a rescue boat arrives. Nicky has drowned. Nearly forty years later, Richard is disturbed by what he perceives as his own inability to feel things deeply. He decides to perform an 'inquest' into his brother's death, believing it to be key to why he represses his emotions. He interviews his mother and two surviving brothers, Tim and Jem, as well as one of the men who crewed the lifeboat that pulled Nicky's body from the sea. He visits his brother's grave for the first time and locates the beach where it happened, forcing himself to revisit the scene. He is shocked when his mother tells him something that he, Tim and Jem have all erased from their memories: immediately after their parents returned from Nicky's funeral (which the boys were not permitted to attend) in their hometown of Swindon, the family drove straight back to the same vacation house they had been renting in Cornwall to spend another week. \\"We had it booked\\", his mother explains. They resumed their holiday without speaking of what had happened, even returning to the very same beach where Nicky had died only days earlier, to picnic. He and his older brother were sent back to boarding school when fall term began a few weeks later, and there again, no one spoke of Nicky, who had also been a student at the school. Richard interviews the school's headmaster, who tells him that during his first months back, he repeatedly woke screaming in the night. Beard's father never spoke of Nicky to anyone again, and his mother said her dead son's name only a few times over the years. Real memories of Nicky have been lost; his own mother remembers him as a poor student who was hopeless at sports, but Richard uncovers his school reports and learns that Nicky had in fact been a star pupil and athlete. When he finds a notebook in which Nicky had written judgments of each of his three brothers, Richard is forced to confront the fact that he hadn't really gotten along with the talented younger brother he feared was catching up to him and threatening his place in the family. Along the way, he reveals a deep resentment toward his father, who died in 2011 but had cancer that summer in 1978 and had not been expected to survive. He is angry with the older man for having sent each of his sons away to live at boarding school - where they had to shut down their feelings of homesick abandonment in order to both avoid being bullied and be judged a success - at the age of eight, for being the prime agent of repression who kept the family from speaking about Nicky, and above all, for not jumping into the sea and trying to save his son that terrible day in Cornwall, when he seemingly had so little to lose. Awards and honors In the U.K., The Day That Went Missing was awarded the 2018 PEN Ackerley Prize for a literary biography of excellence. It was also shortlisted for both the 2017 Rathbones Folio Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize In the U.S., it was named a finalist in the autobiography category for the 2018 National Book Critics Circle Award. Critical reception The Day That Went Missing received favorable reviews from literary critics during both the 2017 U.K. and 2018 U.S. releases. Andrew Holgate, writing in the Sunday Times, called it \\"a memoir of real truth and heartbreaking emotional heft.‚Äù Novelist Nicholas Shakespeare reviewed it for The Spectator and described it as ‚ÄúA monument to the power of literature...a wonderful memoir but also a salvage operation in which he writes himself back into life.\\" The Scotsman literary critic Stuart Kelly said it was \\"a book of consistent astonishments...Beard is one of our most accomplished authors.\\" The reviews for the 2018 U.S. release were similarly positive: Laurie Hertzel wrote in the Minneapolis Star Tribune: \\"Beard‚Äôs book has all the required elements of a great memoir ‚Äî a compelling story, deep introspection, fine writing and an unflinching quest for factual and emotional truth. This haunting book is a profoundly moving study of memory, denial and grief.\\" Publishers Weekly described it as \\"stunning...His beautifully written story is heartbreaking and unforgettable.\\" And Kirkus Reviews said of it: \\"Meticulously crafted and searingly honest, Beard‚Äôs narrative is at once a story about the long and difficult road to self-forgiveness and a commentary on the wages of British emotional repression.\\" Related writing To coincide with the April 2017 UK release of The Day That Went Missing, Beard penned two articles for the newspaper The Guardian. In the first, he wrote about rediscovering, after years of repressing any thoughts of his younger brother, the contentious relationship the two of them had shared. Reading Nicky's laudatory school reports for research: > \\"I realised, or remembered, that on the far side of the wall we had been > rivals...His growing up endangered my status. Bluntly, at that stage in our > lives, we didn‚Äôt like each other, and then he died...Stubborn little > bastard, yes, I remember that now. 'He holds his own and does well to > compete with others who are often physically much larger than he is.' Like > an older brother, for example. Wiry, indefatigable, he just kept > coming...Fuck off, Nicky, I miss you more than I ever said.\\" He concluded the article by writing: > \\"Nicky‚Äôs forcefully lived life, however brief, refused to stay repressed. He > gave 100% and was never satisfied. Everybody said so, and a boy like that > was always going to make it back. He took his time, and death delayed him, > but eventually he caught me up.\\" In the second article, Beard discussed the impact that writing the book had on him and his family after decades of not speaking about Nicky: > \\"The trouble with denial is that it‚Äôs not a precision tool. All those years > ago, we closed our eyes against Nicky‚Äôs death. But in resisting grief we > shut out other stuff too, like the joy Nicky brought us and the > characteristics that made him an individual human being...It was worth > toughing out the doubts to discover that a book could bring my immediate > family closer. I speak more often to my brothers and the response of my > children reassures me that emotional dumbness needn‚Äôt pass glumly from one > generation to the next. Mum sends me frequent postcards, dotted with > exclamation marks, to say that at last she feels a weight has been lifted, > though she also laments the waste of time, our long, ungiving silence.\\" References 2017 non-fiction books British memoirs Harvill Secker books Books about death Books about near-death experiences ","title":"The Day That Went Missing"},{"id":"60542271","text":"Brampton's Own is a 2018 baseball drama film written and directed by Michael Doneger, starring Alex Russell, Rose McIver, and Jean Smart. The story follows Dustin Kimmel, a 30-year-old minor league prospect for the Seattle Mariners who reconnects with his high school sweetheart during the off season. It is Doneger's debut film in both the writing and directing roles. Plot Dustin Kimmel (Russell) is a minor league catcher for the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers in the Seattle Mariners organization and has played in their farm system for the past 12 years. At the end of the season, he is not included in the major league recruitment and is forced to confront the promise he made his family to retire if he wasn't in the major leagues by the age of 30. Dustin's girlfriend, Emma (Voelkel), breaks up with him because their relationship hasn't progressed and he prioritizes his career over her. Dustin's return home is full of surprises: his high school sweetheart Rachel Kinley (McIver) has become engaged to the town's new dentist, Eddie (Porter), his mother is moving in with her boyfriend Bart (Getz), he befriends Bart's young son, and most of his childhood friends have grownup.

The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore writes, \\"While the film effectively captures Dustin's ambivalence and melancholy about giving up on baseball, the love story isn't nearly persuasive, and Dustin's core failure as a person...just feels like a device lifted from bigger sports dramas.\\" The Los Angeles Times Kimber Myers writes, \\"It's better than a number of indie films in its craft - particularly the thoughtfully composed cinematography from Kieran Murphy - but a flawed script ultimately keeps it from eking out a win.\\" The film was screened at the Woods Hole Film Festival Dinner and a Movie series.

An inside midfielder, she played junior football in the TAC Cup Girls and VFL Women's, and competed at four AFL Women's Under 18 Championships. Hanks was recruited by Melbourne with pick 6 in the 2018 AFLW draft and debuted in the opening round of the 2019 season.  Early life  Hanks's junior football began when she was four or five years old; attending the Nar Nar Goon Auskick program. She also played basketball as a junior. Hanks played in boys football competitions in Cora Lynn, Victoria, but moved to Beaconsfield after finishing under-13s to continue with a girls team. Hanks represented Vic Metro in the 2015 and 2016 AFL Women's Under 18 Championships, but switched to Vic Country after selection zones changed for the 2017 competition. She was named in the 2017 All-Australian side in the forward pocket. After the championships Hanks was named in the 2018 AFLW Academy squad as one of twenty-nine seventeen-year-old prospects. As part of this squad she could attend development camps and train with Australian Football League clubs. In 2018, Hanks began studying exercise science at the Australian Catholic University. She co-captained the Gippsland Power in the TAC Cup Girls and was named in the league's Team of the Year. Hanks placed third in the league's best and fairest with 15 votes, one vote behind joint winners Nina Morrison and Madison Prespakis. Hanks attended the AFL Women's Under 18 Championships and was again named in the All-Australian team, this time as a follower. She played for Carlton in the VFL Women's (VFLW); on debut against Geelong at GMHBA Stadium in round 4, she amassed 19 contested possessions and 11 clearances ‚Äì besting all players ‚Äì and a team-high 20 disposals. Aasta O'Connor, who oversaw the AFLW Academy program, believed Hanks would eventually captain an AFLW club. She tested at the 2018 AFLW draft combine and set a record in the agility component with a time of 8.788 seconds, also finishing fifth in the yo-yo test. For the 2018 AFLW draft, prospects were required to nominate a state or region they wished to play in; Hanks was to nominate the Melbourne metropolitan area, preventing Geelong from recruiting her.  AFLW career  Hanks was recruited by Melbourne with pick 6 in the 2018 AFLW draft, their first selection. She injured her knee in a practice match against Melbourne's VFLW affiliate Casey Demons, resulting in bone bruising but no muscle or ligament damage. The injury interrupted Hanks's pre-season but did not prevent her from making her AFLW debut in the opening round of the 2019 season; a loss to at Casey Fields. She played all seven matches in her first season.

For the first 15 years of her life Hanna believes Erik to be her birth father, but she later learns he is not. It is revealed that Erik persuaded Johanna not to abort Hanna so the baby could be part of a CIA programme called UTRAX. In the television series it is revealed that Hanna's real father is named Emil Prodna and at the time Emil did not want to have a relationship with Johanna and have Hanna as his daughter. However when Erik takes her at the age of 15 to meet Emil, his current wife, and his other three children, Emil is happy to meet Hanna and offers her a place to stay in safety. Hanna however gives this up for Erik. Appearance and character Hanna is 5ft 2in (157cm) tall with blue eyes. In the film she has blonde hair, but in the TV series it is brown, although in season 2, she dyes her hair blonde. She has pale skin and her build is slim and athletic, partly due to the intense physical exercise that Erik makes her undertake and partly due to the fact that the CIA used UTRAX to enhanced her DNA in order to breed super soldiers. Due to this Hanna is exceptionally strong for a girl her age and build and has great stamina when running. As she lived in the forest she was home schooled by Erik. Whilst not being unlearned at all she has little knowledge of the practicalities of the modern outside world (she is amazed by an aeroplane and had not heard of Snapchat). Erik raised her to be prolific in languages as she speaks at least English, German, Italian and French. Aside from that she excels at hunting and shooting and hand-to-hand combat skills Erik knew she'd need when she left the forest to evade the CIA. Hanna's first friendship is with a 17 year old Polish logger in the forest and her first close friend is an English girl named Sophie who is around her own age. Having been raised alone by her Erik she has nothing but theoretical knowledge of romance. She rejects the advances of boys who like her, except when she drinks some vodka. Not knowing the effect the drink would have on her she kisses a boy in what others see as an unacceptable public display of affection, whilst she knows no better. She later loses her virginity to an English boy called Anton. It is hinted that Sophie is sexually attracted to Hanna and at one stage Sophie kisses her on the mouth, but Hanna just sees this as a normal part of friendship. Her character is summarised on one of the promotional film posters as \\"Young. Sweet. Innocent. Deadly.\\" When Marissa Wiegler, Hanna and Erik's nemesis, tries to befriend the girl by labelling her \\"unique\\" Hanna replies \\"Unique just means alone\\". Sophie's mother Rachel comments that Hanna is much like her at her age a \\"loner\\".

It was originally a part of the Roman Catholic Church, but has been a part of the Church of Scotland since the Scottish Reformation. John R. Hume describes Cullen Old Church as a fine example of late Scots Gothic architecture, and it was designated a Category A listed building in 1972. It is still an active place of worship, with weekly services presided over by Rev Douglas F Stevenson. First mentioned in records dating from 1236 that document its elevation to a parish church, it was further elevated to collegiate status in 1543, and underwent a series of extensions, improvements and renovations in the centuries that followed. It is known for being the burial place of the internal organs of Queen Elizabeth de Burgh. After Elizabeth died at Cullen Castle in 1327, her body was taken to Dunfermline for interment, but the organs, which were removed as part of the embalming process, were buried at the church. Her husband, King Robert the Bruce, subsequently established a chaplaincy at the church to offer prayers for her soul. Description The east end, with chancel and gable window Cullen Old Church, also known as Cullen Auld Kirk (and, as a Roman Catholic church prior to the reformation, St Mary's Church), sits within a high-walled churchyard, amongst many ornately carved tombs and memorial slabs. It is a simple, cross-plan church, rubble-built with sandstone and granite ashlar detailing for windows, corner stones and tracery. At the apex of the west gable there is an 18th-century bellcote, its south gable has four tall lancet windows, and there is a point-headed window, featuring intersecting tracery, in the gable at the east end of the nave. Rectangular heraldic plaques celebrate the Ogilvy and Gordon families, in honour of the founder of the college and his wife. John R. Hume, former Chief Inspector of Historic Buildings for Historic Scotland, listed it in his book on the hundred best churches in Scotland, describing it as \\"an exceptional example of the influence of the Renaissance on late Scots Gothic\\". =Interior= The interior has a cruciform layout, with a narrow nave, and aisles to north and south. A gallery runs above the west end of the nave, and curves round into the north aisle. There are wooden pews throughout, which were installed in the later 19th century. The walls would have been plastered originally, but this was removed in 1967 to allow repointing of the interior walls. The ceiling retains its original plasterwork with polygonal profiling. Against the south wall, the Seafield Loft, a substantial two-storey gallery, dominates the nave. Its panelled front bears heraldic designs and foliage; it is supported by Corinthian columns at either end, and accessed by a flight of stairs at its east end. An ornate sacrament house, donated by Alexander Ogilvy of Findlater, who helped establish the collegiate church, and his wife Elizabeth Gordon, is built into the east end of the north chancel wall. =Monuments= The church, and surrounding churchyard, house a number of ornately carved monuments. That of Ogilvy and Gordon, who donated the sacrament house, takes the form of a canopied tomb on the north wall of the chancel. Drawing inspiration from the tomb of John de Winchester at Elgin Cathedral, it is elaborately carved, and unusual in that it contains an effigy depicting civilian clothes rather than armour. Carved memorial slabs around the church commemorate various other members of the Ogilvy family, including James Ogilvy, 4th Earl of Findlater and 1st Earl of Seafield, who was Lord Chancellor of Scotland and a signatory to the 1707 Act of Union. History Robert the Bruce and Elizabeth de Burgh The current building looks superficially like an ordinary eighteenth- or nineteenth-century parish church, but it actually has a much longer and more complex history. The first surviving record of the church is a successful petition of 1236 requesting that it be elevated from a chapel of the parish of Fordyce to a parish church. In 1327, Queen Elizabeth de Burgh, second wife of Robert the Bruce, died at Cullen Castle, a royal residence; her entrails were removed as part of the embalming process, and were buried in the church grounds, prior to her body being sent south to Dunfermline for interment. The King founded a chaplaincy at the church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, patron saint of Cullen, to offer prayers for her soul. In 1536, a chaplaincy of St Anne was founded by Elena Hay, and she had a south aisle added to the simple medieval church. Soon afterwards, in 1543, it was elevated from a parochial to a collegiate church, one of 38 such churches in Scotland at the time. This was led by Alexander Ogilvy of Findlater; Alexander Dick, Archdeacon of Glasgow; John Duff of Muldavit, Hay's son; and the parishioners of Cullen. Work was done on the east end of the church at this time to lengthen the chancel. As a collegiate church, it had six prebendaries, and two choristers to sing daily masses. A laird's loft (a gallery in a church reserved for the family of the laird), known as the Seafield Loft, was installed by the Ogilvys in 1602 to allow members of the family to sit apart from, and above, the rest of the congregation. It is decorated with armorial panelling emphasising the influence of the family, who were by then baronets. The loft, with pew below, is one of the earliest and best-preserved examples of such a structure surviving in Scotland. A north aisle was added to the building around 1798; the gallery running from the west end of the nave into the north aisle is believed to date from the early nineteenth century. Between 1820 and 1830, a new town was built for the residents of Cullen, and the old town was entirely demolished to allow the Earls of Seafield to improve their estate. Cullen Old Church is the only remaining building from the original village. A carving of the Virgin and Child, currently to be found on the old mercat cross in Cullen Square, was moved from outside the church gates at this time. Most of the windows currently in the building likely date either from work done at this time, or from restoration works carried out on behalf of the Dowager Countess of Seafield in 1885. A vestry was built in the angle between the north aisle and the chancel in 1967; work done at that time stripped the original plaster from the interior walls. In 1972, it was designated a Category A listed building. In 2016, LDN Architects were commissioned to conduct a strategic study on the building to identify and cost necessary maintenance work. The report found that an overhaul of the roof, repointing to interior and exterior walls, and the installation of a heating system and a disabled lavatory would all be required, at an estimated cost of ¬£300,000. The North East Preservation Trust allocated a grant to fund the work. =List of chaplains and ministers= Pre-reformation *Alexander Forcyth, 1472 *Thomas Gregor, 1542 *William Malisoun, 1542 *Sir Gilbert Davesoun, 1542 (Prebendary 1543) *William Elphinstone, 1543 *Robert Leith, 1543 *John Thain, 1543 *George Gray, 1543 *William Lawtie (Prebendary), 1553 *Sir George Duff (Provost), 1563 Post-reformation *William Lawtie, 1563 *Gilbert Gardyne, 1568‚Äì1589 *Alexander Hay, 1590‚Äì1594 *Patrick Darg, 1599‚Äì1601 *George Douglas, 1601‚Äì1641 *George Lesley, 1642‚Äì1647 *Alexander Setone, 1647‚Äì1650 *James Chalmer, 1652‚Äì1653 *Robert Tait, 1697‚Äì1700 *Alexander Irvine, 1705‚Äì1717 *James Lawtie, 1717‚Äì1751 *James Anderson, 1751‚Äì1762 *Robert Grant, 1762‚Äì1808 *George Innes, 1808‚Äì1829 *George Henderson, 1829‚Äì1884 *William T P Macdonald, 1884‚Äì1900 *William G G McLean, 1901‚Äì1927 *William G Robertson, 1927‚Äì1936 *John T Guthrie 1967‚Äì1986 *Alexander J MacPherson, 1987‚Äì1996 *G Melvyn Wood, 1997‚Äì2004 *Wilma A Johnston, 2006‚Äì2008 *John Oswald (Interim Minister) 2009 *Douglas F Stevenson, 2010 ‚Äì present Current usage Cullen Old Church is still in use as an active place of worship.

The tournament is set up in a 24-player bracket-style format. Tournament Structure The 24 participants are chosen and seeded based on points earned in qualifying to-date tournaments of the current season. (For 2019, this included 13 events, from the PBA Hall of Fame Classic through the USBC Masters; for 2020, this included 12 events due to the cancellation of the USBC Masters.) PBA Tour points are awarded on a tier system, as follows: * Tier 3: PBA short format or limited field tournaments (2500 points for first, and descending thereafter) * Tier 2: PBA standard tournaments with a fully open field (double the points of Tier 3 events) * Tier 1: PBA major tournaments (triple the points of Tier 3 events) The top eight players in points receive byes into the second round (round of 16). The #9 through #24 seeds compete in single-elimination matches (one standard ten-frame game each) to determine who advances to the second round. Round 2 and all subsequent rounds feature double-elimination matches, also known as the \\"race to two points\\". Any player winning both games in a match earns two points and advances to the next round. If the match is split one game each, the players bowl a 9th/10th frame roll-off to determine who wins the second point and the right to advance. If the 9th/10th frame roll-off results in a tie, a one-ball, sudden death roll-off is used until a winner is determined. The PBA Players Committee originally voted to make the Playoffs a non-title event, citing the low number of games bowled as the primary reason. However, on December 6, 2019, the PBA announced that the winner of the 2019 PBA Playoffs would retroactively be awarded a PBA Tour title, and that the winner of the 2020 PBA Playoffs and subsequent events will be credited with a PBA title. As of 2020, winners also receive a WWE championship belt, as part of a cross-promotion with WWE wrestling, which is also broadcast on Fox Sports (current home of the PBA). 2019 event The inaugural PBA Playoffs took place April 8‚Äì10 and June 1‚Äì2, 2019 at Bayside Bowl in Portland, Maine. The PBA called it the \\"spotlight event\\" for its first year of television coverage on Fox Sports. The tournament had a total prize fund of $276,000 with a $100,000 first place prize. The first three ‚Äúelimination‚Äù rounds were held April 8‚Äì10, with broadcasts of these events held on eight consecutive Monday nights (April 8 ‚Äì May 27) on FS1. The final four then competed on live broadcasts held June 1‚Äì2 on Fox. =2019 event bracket= 2020 event On June 2, 2019, PBA Commissioner Tom Clark announced that the 2020 PBA Tour Playoffs would take place April‚ÄìMay 2020 in four cities, as part of the partnership agreement with Bowlero Corporation (now the parent company of the PBA). However, due to the suspension of the 2020 PBA season in mid-March caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was rescheduled for October 10‚Äì12, 2020. All events are being held in Centreville, Virginia with no fans in attendance.

Early life and education  Parker was born in El Salvador to British parents and spent parts of his childhood in Great Britain, Norway and Barbados. He earned a degree in English from Balliol College, Oxford.  Writing career  Parker's first two books were about World War II. The Battle of Britain, July‚ÄìOctober 1940: An Oral History of Britain's Finest Hour was published in 2000, and Monte Cassino: The Story of the Hardest-Fought Battle in World War II came out in 2004. Of the latter, Publishers Weekly said \\"Parker details, with the aid of hundreds of survivor interviews and war diaries, the Allied siege of the monastery at Monte Cassino, a mountainous fiefdom massively fortified...With command and ground-level detail that buffs will savor, Parker goes over what seems like every inch of the multinational force's campaign.\\" His book Panama Fever: The Epic Story of One of the Greatest Human Achievements of All Time-- the Building of the Panama Canal (retitled Hell's Gorge: The Battle to Build the Panama Canal for the UK paperback edition) came out in 2007. Allan Massie reviewed it for The Telegraph: \\"His narrative is compelling, his ability to weave a pattern from the topics he has to cover quite remarkable...There isn‚Äôt a dull page, and if this book isn‚Äôt a candidate for all the non-fiction prizes going, I shall be disappointed.\\" In 2011, he published The Sugar Barons: Family, Corruption, Empire and War in the West Indies. It was named a Book of the Year by The Economist and John Gimlette of The Spectator called it \\"compelling, wonderful history. The Sugar Barons is an exemplary book; history as it should be written.\\" Parker next turned to biography, with an account of the life of James Bond author Ian Fleming during his years living in Jamaica, titled Goldeneye: Where Bond Was Born-- Ian Fleming's Jamaica (2014). It was nominated for an Edgar Award in 2016. In 2015, his first look at a period of history before the modern era was published. Willoughbyland: England's Lost Colony is the story of Lord Willoughby's short-lived 17th-century colony in what is now Suriname. John Gimlette reviewed it for The Spectator: \\"A miniature masterpiece...this is a truly extraordinary tale and, in Parker‚Äôs hands, it‚Äôs beautifully told. With great wit and scholarship he reveals ‚Äî just for a moment ‚Äî a cruel and curious world, before it vanishes again beneath the trees.\\"  Personal life  Parker lives in London with his wife and three children. He is a bowler on the Authors XI amateur cricket team, which is composed of British writers, and he contributed a chapter to the team's book about their first season playing together, The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon (Bloomsbury, 2013).

Background Being a small island county, Kinmen had been facing water scarcity problems for years. In 2013, the county drew more than 8,000 tonnes of groundwater every day. Reservoirs were barely sufficient to supply water during dry season. The Kinmen County Government considered seawater desalination as one of several options. However, the cost of desalination was too much for the county government to bear. Therefore, purchasing water from Mainland China was the most feasible solution. History Kinmen County first expressed their intention to purchase water from Mainland China in 1996 when it suffered from severe drought. In 2000, the Water Resources Bureau accessed the idea of creating such infrastructure project. In June 2013, Taiwan and Mainland China agreed to cooperate to solve the water shortage in Kinmen during the Cross- Strait Service Trade Agreement in Shanghai. In late August 2013, a delegation from Kinmen County led by Kinmen County Deputy Commissioner Wu You-qin () held talks with their mainland counterparts in Mainland China. In 2014, the Executive Yuan gave approval for the Jinjiang‚ÄìKinmen Pipeline project. On 23‚Äì24 May 2015, Head of Taiwan Affairs Office Zhang Zhijun visited Kinmen to discuss the water supply plan from Fujian to Kinmen while touring the Tianpu Reservoir. Later in July 2015, both sides signed the agreement for Mainland China to supply drinking water to Kinmen by the water authorities of both sides. =Inauguration ceremony= The water started its maiden supply on 5 August 2018 in a ceremony named Cross-Strait Water Supply Ceremony in Chinese language which was attended by Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Fu-hai and Kinmen County Constituency Legislator Yang Cheng-wu. Separately at the same day in Mainland China, a separate ceremony was held at Jinjiang City which was attended by Taiwan Affairs Office Director Liu Jieyi, former Fujian Province Governor Yu Weiguo and more than 20 councilors of Kinmen County Council. Technical specification Tianpu Reservoir From Mainland China, the water is mainly sourced from Longhu Lake () which has a capacity of 655 million m3 of water. The lake is the second largest lake in Fujian. From the lake, the water goes to a water pumping station and transported inland to the coastal city of Bingzhou before being transported through an undersea pipe which spans over a length of 16.7 km through the straits separating Mainland China and Kinmen. After reaching Kinmen Island, the pipeline goes for another 300 meters inland to a water treatment plant before supplying the Tianpu Reservoir. The maximum capacity of the pipe can reach up to 55,000 tonnes per day. Finance Both sides signed an agreement on a 30-year water purchase agreement. Under the agreement, Kinmen imports at an average of 34,000 tonnes of water per day at a cost of NT$9.86 per cubic meter of water. The total cost for the pipeline construction was NT$1.35 billion.

Upon infection, the pathogen can cause coffee berry disease (CBD) which is also known as Brown Blight when it occurs on younger fruits still green in color. The fungus was first reported in Kenya in 1922, and is found throughout most of Africa. C. coffeanum is only found in Africa, but other species of Colletotrichum can be found throughout the rest of the world.  Symptoms when infected  256x256px Infection can take place in as short a time as 2 hours, and can infect any part of the plant. Berries are most susceptible 4‚Äì14 weeks after flowering, during their expansion phase. Active lesions of the fungus are first noticeable as brown, sunken spots which quickly spread across the entire fruit. When C. coffeanum creates spores, it is evident by a pink crust on the surface of the infected area. The bean can stop growing if the infection is set early on in its development. The infection of the crop can significantly reduce the amount of fruit a farm can produce per year.  Prevention  Pruning practices and the use of fungicides can aid in the prevention of infection by this pathogen. The most effective fungicides are \\"50% copper formulations, captafol, chlorothalonil, benomyl, thiophanate-methyl, thiabendazole, and dithianon.\\" References Fungal plant pathogens and diseases Colletotrichum ","title":"Colletotrichum coffeanum"},{"id":"60543103","text":"The Guerra del Golfo (2019) (Spanish for \\"Gulf War\\") was a professional wrestling supercard show produced and scripted by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) that took place on April 7, 2019. The show was the 12th year in a row that IWRG has held a Guerra del Golfo show, which usually takes places in the early spring, around March or April. The eponymous Guerra del Golfo tournament consists of three matches in total, with two \\"qualifying matches\\", multi-man steel cage matches where the last person left in the cage is \\"punished\\" by advancing to the main event of the night. The two losers were then be forced to wrestle inside the steel cage under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. For the 2019 Guerra del Golfo Tortuga Mike and Metale√≥n lost their respective cage matches and were forced to fight each other. In the end, Mike lost and was forced to unmask and reveal his given name, Hector Eduardo Martinez Sanchez, to the audience. The show featured four additional matches, including Cerebro Negro successfully defending the IWRG Intercontinental Welterweight Championship against Demonio Infernal. Production =Background= The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has a long-standing history of holding major event focused on a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. In 2005 IWRG created a specific spring-time show promoting the steel cage match concept under the name Guerra del Golfo, or \\"Gulf War\\", referring to the Gulf of Mexico (not the Gulf War in the middle east). The Guerra del Golfo shows featured two \\"qualifying\\" multi-man steel cage matches where the loser would later be forced to face off against each other in the main event of the show. In the final cage match the two wrestlers would wrestle where the loser would be forced to either unmask or, if they are not wearing a mask, have his hair shaved off. The use of the steel cage in three matches distinguishes the Guerra del Golfo event from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG El Castillo del Terror'(\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\"), or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The first two Guerra del Golfo steel cage matches are contested under elimination match rules, which means wrestlers escape the cage by climbing over the top of the steel cage to the floor. The last wrestler in the cage will be put in the final match of the night. Unlike the first two steel cage matches the final match is normally contested under pinfall rules. The Guerra del Golfo shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and is their home arena, with the group rarely venturing outside of Naucalpan. The 2016 Guerra del Golfo show was the tenth IWRG promoted a show under that name, and the ninth year in a row since becoming an annual event from 2008 forwardand the eleventh Guerra del Golfo show owing to IWRG holding two events in 2009. Prior to the 2019 event five wrestlers had lost their masks; Ultra Mega, Tortuguillo Ninja I, Destroyer, Astro, and Tortuga Teelo, while seven wrestlers were shaved bald; Cerebro Negro, Arlequ√≠n Rojo, Chico Che (twice), Oficial AK-47 (twice), and Danny Casas. =Storylines= The event featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event In the opening match, Puma de Oro defeated Guerrero 2000 by pinfall in a match that was not taped for television. Maquina Infernal was originally advertised for the second match of the nigh, but was replaced and instead Mexica and Saurman defeated the Neza Kid and Toto two falls to one. The third match of the night saw the rudo trio of Eterno, Lunatic Xtreme, and √öltimo Maldito defeated the trio of Ark√°ngel Divino, Dinamic Black, Erag√≥n in a match that was so liked by the fans that they threw money in the ring, a lucha libre tradition for really good matches. The fourth match of the night saw Cerebro Negro successfully defend the IWRG Intercontinental Welterweight Championship, this time against Demonio Infernal. Cerebro Negro won two falls to one, in another match that saw fans throw money in the ring. Both of the initial steel cage matches were contested under \\"escape rules\\", where the last person in the cage would be deemed the loser of the match. Oficial Rayan was originally announced for the match, but Capo del Norte replaced him without any official explanation. In the end Metale√≥n was left in the cage after Black Danger, S√∫per Nova, Multifac√©tico, Manchas, Capo del Norte, Golden Magic, and Imposible all climbed up the side of the cage and over the top. In the second cage match Tortuga Mike lost the cage match to El Hijo de Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez, S√©ptimo Rayo, Mosca, El Hijo del Alebrije, El Hijo del Medico Asesino, Death Metal, and Diablo Jr. The third and final steel cage match saw Metale√≥n pin Tortuga Mike, making him the second Tortuga Ninja to lose his mask at a Guerra del Golfo, as Tortuga Teelo has lost his mask at the 2018 event. After the match Tortuga Mike unmasked and revealed that his real name was Hector Eduardo Martinez Sanchez, that he was 25 years old at the time of the show, and had been a wrestler for 6 years.

The same month saw the launch of London Power, a partnership with the Mayor of London. In May 2020, Australian electricity and gas supplier Origin Energy paid 507 million for a 20% stake in Octopus Energy. This meant Octopus gained \\"unicorn\\" status, as a startup company with a value in excess of ¬£1 billion. In September 2020, Octopus Energy announced that it had acquired Silicon Valley startup Evolve Energy for an undisclosed sum in order to expand into the US market.  Operations  = Gas and electricity supply = As of May 2020, the company had over 1.5 million domestic and business customers. The company does not generate gas or electricity, instead making purchases on the wholesale market, although sister company Octopus Renewables claims to be the UK's largest investor in solar farms, and also invests in wind power and anaerobic digesters. , Octopus Energy stated that all its electricity came from renewable sources, and it offered a \\"green\\" gas tariff with carbon offsetting. Besides industry-standard fixed and variable tariffs, the company is known for innovative tariffs which are made possible by the national rollout of smart meters. These include: * Octopus Tracker ‚Äì gas and electricity prices change every day, and are based on wholesale prices for that day, with disclosure of overheads and the company's profit margin. * Octopus Agile ‚Äì electricity prices change every half hour, according to a schedule published the previous day, determined from wholesale prices. The price occasionally goes negative (i.e. customers are paid to use electricity) at times of high generation and low demand. * Octopus Go ‚Äì a tariff with a reduced rate for an overnight period, intended for owners of electric vehicles. The company claims to treat customers more fairly than the \\"Big Six\\" suppliers. In March 2019, Octopus Energy announced it had partnered with Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant, to optimise home energy use through the Agile Octopus time-of-use tariff. As part of their partnership agreed in August 2019, Midcounties Co-operative and Octopus established a joint venture to develop the UK's community energy market and encourage small-scale electricity generation.  Brands  Besides the Octopus Energy brand, customers are supplied under the Affect Energy, Co-op Energy, M&S; Energy and London Power brands. = Electric vehicle charging = In 2020, Octopus Energy launched their Electric Juice service, through which users of electric vehicle charge points can have the costs added to their electricity bill. By October, four charge point operating companies had joined the service with around 1,000 points between them. = Software development = A significant part of Octopus Energy's profit and revenue comes from licensing their proprietary customer management system called Kraken, which runs on Amazon's cloud computing service. It was first licensed by UK rival Good Energy in late 2019, for an initial three-year term, to manage its 300,000 customers. In March 2020 it was announced that E.ON and its nPower subsidiary had licensed the technology to manage their combined 10 million customers. The software would also be licensed to Australia's Origin Energy as part of their May 2020 agreement.

She was part of the Indonesian Navy's Western Fleet (Koarmabar), participating in anti-piracy operations and EEZ patrols. On 17 June 2016, Imam Bonjol received aerial reconnaissance reports of foreign fishing ships in Indonesian waters around the Natuna Archipelago, and proceeded to pursue the vessels. She fired warning shots, which according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs injured a fisherman. One of the vessels, the Han Tan Cou (19038) was captured with her crew of 7 Chinese nationals. Chinese Coast Guard vessels shadowed the Imam Bonjol as she escorted Han Tan Cou to the Indonesian naval base at Ranai, though no fighting occurred.

The event commemorated the sport of lucha libre becoming allowed in the State of Mexico, with the first lucha libre show held in the state taking place in December 1962. Over the years IWRG has on occasion celebrated the anniversary, although not consistently holding an anniversary show every year. The main event of the five-match show was a best two-out-of-three falls six- man \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team match. IWRG had originally advertised wrestlers Tit√°n and Trit√≥n from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) for the main event, but CMLL cancelled Tit√°n and Trit√≥n's appearance on the show. Instead IWRG paired Argos up with Crazy Boy and Danny Casas as late replacements. The team lost to La Famila de Tijuana ( Dami√°n 666, Halloween, and X-Fly). The show featured four additional matches, including the first appearance of Mini Psycho Clown working as the masked \\"Dr. Karontes\\" after leaving Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide in the weeks before the anniversary show. Production =Background= The history of lucha libre, or professional wrestling in Mexico goes all the way back to the early 1900s where individual promoters would hold shows on a local basis in various Mexican states. In 1933 Salvador Lutteroth created Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL; Spanish for \\"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\\") and in subsequent years took EMLL to a national level. In the 1930s and 1940s various Mexican starts to create lucha libre commissions, often as an extension of the existing Boxing commissions, responsible for overview of lucha libre in each state, licensing wrestlers and ensuring the rules are being enforced. In the State of Mexico lucha libre was not officially sanctioned in late 1962, with the first lucha libre show in the State of Mexico held in December 1962. The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has on occasion held a major show in December to commemorate the \\"birth\\" of Lucha Libre in their home state. It is unclear exactly when IWRG started to mark the Anniversary, records confirm that they held a show to commemorate the event starting in 2010 commemorating the 48th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico, possibly prior to that. The 2015 show was for the 53rd anniversary and was held on December 16, 2015, in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico where IWRG holds almost all of their major lucha libre shows. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event In the opening match, a best two-out-of- three falls tag team match, Alas de Acero and Aram√≠s defeated Los √Ångeles de la Muerte (I and II) two falls to one. The second match of the night introduced a new \\"Dr. Karontes\\" to the public, after having previously worked as \\"Mini Karontes\\" elsewhere. Dr. Karontes, Hip Hop Man and Imposible defeated the trio of Kaling Black, L√°tigo, and Rocket Rojo. In the third match of the night, Los Insoportables (\\"The Unbearables\\"; Apolo Estrada Jr. and Eterno (wrestler)Eterno) defeated longtime rivals Los Mariachis Locos (\\"The Crazy Mariachis\\": El Diablo Jr. and El Hijo del Diablo) two falls to one. The fourth match of the night featured 3 second-generation wrestlers as El Hijo de Mascara Sagrada (son of Mascara Sagrada, and El Hijo del Alebrije (son of El Alebrije) teamed up with Emperador Azteca to face off against Halloween Jr. (son of Halloween), Canis Lupus and Tony Rivera. The match ended when Halloween Jr. fouled El Hijo de Mascara Sagrada, causing his team to be disqualified. After the match Halloween Jr. Canis Lupus and Rivera stole the masks of their opponents. The main event match was originally supposed to include Tit√°n and Trit√≥n from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) teaming up with Argos for the match. For unexplained reasons neither of the two CMLL wrestlers showed up for the show, which meant that IWRG had Argos team up with Crazy Boy and Danny Casas to take on La Famila de Tijuana (Dami√°n 666, Halloween, and X-Fly). La Famila won the match after Dami√°n 666 fouled Argos without the referee seeing it, pinning him seconds later. After the match fans threw money in the ring in appreciation of the match they had just watched.

Early life The son of the Dr. Thomas Eyton-Jones of Wrexham, a nephew of Sir Edward Samuelson who was Lord Mayor of Liverpool 1872 - 1873 and a great nephew of Sir Rowland Hill, the inventor of the Penny Post. Eyton-Jones was brought up as a devoutly conservative Christian and was encouraged to develop an interest in theological, political and social matters. Career Eyton-Jones took his theological education at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he obtained a B.A. degree in 1885 and an M.A. in 1894, before going to study at Ridley Hall, Cambridge. He was ordained deacon in 1886 and on 18 December 1887 he was ordained a priest at Worcester Cathedral. From 1886 to 1889 he was curate of St. Clement's, Birmingham, which is where he met Jane Elizabeth Savage, who would later become his wife, both of whom had a shared interest in volunteering and overseas missionary work. Having been influenced by the Cambridge Seven, who had formed to preach in China through the China Inland Mission in 1885, Eyton-Jones was initiated into the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in March 1889. In October 1889, at a valedictory meeting held in the Henry Martyn Memorial Hall, a centre of Christian and missionary influence, Eyton-Jones was one of eight men who had named themselves The Cambridge Eight to discuss their departure under the Church Missionary Society. Eyton-Jones volunteered for the mission field in China, then under the Qing dynasty. Eyton-Jones and his wife sailed in 1889 and stayed in the area around Fuzhou on the south east coast for eight years. This one hundred mile expanse became his parish including two large harbours and their surrounding villages as well as several islands located twenty miles from the mainland. The couple's first three children were born in China, where they spent eight years with the CMS. For transport he sailed up the rivers in a yacht presented to him by his uncle Sir Edward Samuelson. Within a year his language became fluent and his background in boxing gave him a good foundation in Jujutsu. In March 1895 at the Consular District of Fuzhou where Eyton-Jones had opened a book shop having been provided a passport by the Prefect of Fujian, an attempt was made on his life by a follower of the zhaijiao \\"fasting school\\" who had been protesting against the Christian missionaries for some time, the culprit drew a knife and ran at him before being rendered defenceless by eyewitnesses and was identified as a servant of the local magistrate and so received no punishment. On 2 August 1895 Eyton-Jones conducted the funeral service for the Rev. Robert Stewart, who was murdered along with ten other people including his family members in 1895. Known as The Kucheng Massacre, this traumatic incident would have had a lasting psychological effect on Eyton-Jones. Ill health made him return to the United Kingdom in 1900, spending one year living with the family of his older brother John Eyton-Jones at Abbotsfield, Wrexham, before moving to London. From 1900 to 1911 Eyton-Jones was curate of St. Stephen's, Ealing, then became vicar of St. Paul's Hounslow Heath in 1911. Over 31 years in this role, Hounslow developed from a semi-rural district to a significant London suburb. He was appointed surrogate in 1918. During World War I he was appointed as clergyman assisting the Chaplain to the Forces in presiding over servicemen. He was later chosen by the Chaplain-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force to be minister to squadrons in training on Hounslow Heath, also serving as Chaplain to the Officer Training Corps of the Inns of Court Regiment until the outbreak of World War II. Eyton-Jones was employed by the Royal Army Chaplains' Department to work as chaplain at Hounslow Barracks for four months. Throughout the war he worked closely with the YMCA, allowing the church hall to be used as a rest and social centre for military people stationed locally. During The Blitz he visited bomb shelters to preach and counsel the occupants. Eyton-Jones was known to be a member of the Sir Garnet Wolseley Lodge of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes. Death His wife Jane Elizabeth Eyton-Jones died during the war in May, 1940. A severe attack of shingles inspired him to write a letter of resignation to the bishop in the winter of 1942, however he died in the spring of 1943.

The main event of the show featured three wrestlers, Herodes Jr., Trauma I and El Hijo de Dos Caras, competing in the Triangular de la Muerte; a three-way Luchas de Apuestas bet match. The Triangular match featured three individual matches, with the first wrestler to win two matches escaping the \\"Triangle\\". For the match Herodes Jr. put his hair on the line, Trauma I risked his match and El Hijo de Dos Casas put the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on the line. In the end Trauma I pinned El Hijo de Dos Caras to win the championship. The show featured four matches in addition to the Triangular de la Muerte matches. Production =Background= The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has Triangular de la Muerte (Spanish for \\"Triangle of Death\\") matches on several occasions since its creation in 1997. Traditionally Luchas de Apuestas (\\"bet matches\\") are contested as either singles or tag team matches, but IWRG has used a hybrid version featuring three wrestlers or three teams all \\"betting\\" something on the match. In another deviation from tradition IWRG often chooses to have one participant risk their championship instead of their mask or their hair. Their only Triangular de la Muerte show in 2016 was held on February 14, 2016 in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico where IWRG holds almost all of their major lucha libre shows. =Storylines= The event featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event In the opening match, Adrenalina and Matrix Jr. defeated Alas de Acero and Shadow Boy in two straight falls. The tecnico team of Astro, Drag√≥n Fly, and S√∫per Astro Jr. defeated Argentinean Hip Hop Man and Mexicans Atomic Star and Power Bull in a Best two-out-of-three falls six-man \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team match. In the third match of the night, Los Mariachis Locos (\\"The Crazy Mariachi band\\"; El Diablo Jr., El Hijo del Diablo, and Imposible defeated Los Terribles Cerebros (\\"The Terrible Brains\\"; Black Terry, Cerebro Negro, and Dr. Cerebro) by disqualification when Los Terribles Cerebroswere disqualified for breaking the rules. Argos was originally scheduled for the fourth match of the night, but was replaced by Eterno, as Eterno teamed up with Emperador Azteca and Veneno. The makeshift team lost to Heddi Karaoui, Negro Navarro, and Trauma II as Eterno could not get along with his partners. After the match, Eterno challenged Karaoui to defend the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship against him at a later date. The first two participants in the main event Triangular de la Muerte match were determined by a coin toss, which decided who of the three wrestlers had to sit out the first match. El Hijo de Dos Caras won the coin toss and had to wait outside the ring as Herodes Jr. and Trauma I had to wrestle each other. Herodes Jr. pinned Trauma I to win the first match, giving him the advantage going into the second match. Herodes Jr. also won the second match, this time by breaking the rules without being caught, pinning El Hijo de Dos Caras after a low blow. The third and final match of the Triangular de la Muerte saw Trauma I force El Hijo de Dos Casas to submit, making him the 21st IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. Aftermath Trauma I's first reign as the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion lasted for 70 days, until he lost the championship to M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. on April 24, 2016.

Westdene lies between the historic suburb of Sophiatown and Melville with the Melville Koppies West nature reserve to the north of the suburb. Westdene derives its name from its location, literally meaning west-valley. 'West' since it is located west from the city centre and with 'dene' derived from the Old English denu, meaning valley. History Johannesburg in 1902 and the farm Braamfontein. The arrow points to where Westdene would eventually be situated. =Before the 20th century= Westdene was originally part of the farm Braamfontein, established in the area in 1853. The farm stretched from Westdene in the west to Houghton in the east and from Newtown in the south to Linden in the north. Various parts of the farm were sub-divided and sold many times over and in 1871 Gerhardus Petrus Bezuidenhout sold his south-western portion of the farm to Frans Johannes van Dijk who in turn sold the land to Johannes Jacobus Lindeque in 1884. The portion of land became known as Lindeque's Portion and would eventually develop into the present-day suburbs of Auckland Park, Cottesloe and Westdene. Hendrik Wilhelm Struben obtained permission from Lindeque to prospect the area for gold in 1885 but no evidence of gold was discovered. In 1887 Lindeque sold a portion to the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek for 4000 pounds. The government's intention with acquiring the land was to improve the water supply to Johannesburg, but soon the government also laid out the first suburbs on the farm in 1888 and 1889. =Early 20th century= In 1902 the area to become Westdene was surveyed for the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company after the surrounding suburbs of Auckland Park, Melville and Richmond had been proclaimed and established. In 1905 the area was laid out, but Westdene would only formally be established in 1910. In the early 20th century a brickfield was started in the area where the current Westdene dam is located. Albert Edward Wells formed the Wells Brickfield in the area around 1911. The brickfield lay south-west of the Westdene-spruit (or stream).Republic of South Africa National Archives, WLD, 5/167, 184/1911 Early maps of the suburb show two parks, Tighy park and another unknown park that would later become the Westdene recreation centre. View towards the first established residences along the Westdene streets (Source: Museum Africa) In 1932 the South African Government decided to abandon the gold standard and the country subsequently experienced a sustained period of economic growth. To meet the growing demand the Wells Brickfield expanded operations which led to the clay quarrying activities in the area creating a number small dams. A map of the area from 1934 depict the dams created as well as the first properties to be built in the area. South of Westdene the original Auckland Park horse racing track can be seen which would later become the Rand Afrikaans University and later the University of Johannesburg. Map of Westdene from 1934 depicting a number of small dams created by clay quarrying activities in the area. The brickfield in the area closed in 1943 and the abandoned land was possibly transferred to the Johannesburg city council. The city council would later develop the Westdene Park here. An aerial photograph that was taken in 1952 shows how the number of smaller dams in the area grew to create two distinct dams. The south-west dam was known as \\"Blue-dam\\" and the north-east dam \\"Westdene-dam\\". These two distinct dams were separated by a small footpath visible on the aerial photograph, but would later merge into one dam and be known simply as Westdene Dam. Further north-east a smaller separate dam would remain, known as \\"Padda-dam\\" (or Frog Dam). Aerial photograph of Westdene from 1952. Westdene was and remained a white working-class suburb for most of the 20th century. =Sophiatown forced removals= After the establishment of Soweto in 1923 white working-class neighbours in Westdene and Newlands began asking for the removal of black people in neighbouring Sophiatown. The perception arose that the suburb was too close to white suburbia. Under the Immorality Amendment Act, No 21 of 1950, people of mixed races could not reside together, which made it possible for the government to segregate the different races. In 1955 the government removed black, Indian and coloured families from Sophiatown by force. The area was rezoned for whites only and renamed 'Triomf' (Afrikaans for Triumph) by the government. According to some accounts \\"there were mixed feelings in Westdene about their Sophiatown neighbours, with most residents wanting to keep their white exclusivity\\". =Westdene dam disaster= On 27 March 1985, a school bus transporting children from Vorentoe High School, left the road as it was crossing the bridge of the Westdene Dam. 30 Children swam to safety or were rescued from the rooftop of the bus. 42 Children were unable to escape the bus and died.https://www.westdene1985.co.za/ =1990s‚Äìpresent= Despite the occurrence of so-called \\"white flight\\" in the suburbs near the Johannesburg Central Business District after the end of apartheid, and subsequent urban decay, Westdene has remained a suburb with a white majority (as evident from census data). In 2017 Tighy Park was used as a construction site for Kingsway Civil, a construction company carrying out construction and upgrades around the area. The company agreed to beautify and upgrade the park once construction in the area was complete.https://northcliffmelvilletimes.co.za/263866/park-upgrade-planned- for-westdene/ Also in 2017 the Westdene Dam (and surrounding park) was closed for several months due to construction on the City of Johannesburg‚Äôs Corridors of Freedom project.https://northcliffmelvilletimes.co.za/261872/westdene-dam- will-remain-closed-for-the-next-while/ Both parks have been upgraded since. With the close proximity to The University of Johannesburg as well as the University of the Witwatersrand and the growing number of students at these institutions, the suburb has recently experienced an influx of students looking for residence. The general shortage of student accommodation in Johannesburg has led to multiple illegal communes reported in the suburb.https://northcliffmelvilletimes.co.za/illegal-communes/ Education Two schools are located in Westdene - West Rand SDA Primary Schoolhttps://skools.co.za/listings/west-rand-sda-primary-school/ and Orban School.http://orban.co.za/ Both are private primary schools with the latter a double medium (Afrikaans and English) school and the former an English medium school. While the University of Johannesburg is located in Auckland Park, the university has a number of sport fields and sporting facilities located in Westdene.https://www.uj.ac.za/corporateservices/centres/uj- sport/Pages/Facilities.aspx These include: * UJ Hockey Field * UJ Absa Cricket Oval * UJ Athletics Track * UJ West Sport facilities Westdene Graffiti Project One of the many wall murals found in Westdene July 2015 saw the start of The Westdene Graffiti Project. A local community initiative by Westdene residents donating their property walls to graffiti artists for street art and murals. The project is aimed at beautifying the suburb and have been quite successful with over 40 murals (to date) scattered around the suburb.

He is the leader of the far-right political party Hard Line, which he founded in 2017. He is the older brother of poet Tine Paludan and writer Martin Paludan. Paludan himself has a migration background as his father is Swedish journalist Tomas Polvalland he has lived in Sweden at times, which according to himself gives him the right to Swedish citizenship. He has acted as defence attorney in a number of cases involving self-styled \\"critics of the system\\" and proponents of medical cannabis, but also in several cases involving immigrant asylum.https://www.information.dk/indland/2016/10/kan- rasmus-paludan-forsvare-udlaendinge-samtidig-vaere-pegida Between September 2015 and August 2018 Paludan was employed as a lecturer at the law faculty of the University of Copenhagen in the areas of civil law and property law. In April 2019 he was convicted of expressing racist views (Clause ¬ß 266b in the Danish penal code). He appealed to the High Court of Eastern Denmark, which confirmed the sentence. In June 2020 Paludan was sentenced to a three-month prison term, with two of the months suspended. In addition he was also barred from working as a lawyer for three years, and lost his driver's license for one year. The case included 14 different charges, and Paludan was found guilty in all of them. They included expression of racist views and an episode in Sor√∏ where Paludan drove into a man when he tried to escape a situation where he felt threatened. Paludan is under constant police protection. In October 2020 Paludan was officially declared a Swedish citizen by authorities as his father is Swedish.  Education  At 25 years old, Paludan held a bachelor's degree in law and had the ninth-highest average score among his fellow 187 students who finished their law degrees and started their degrees the same year. According to his father, Paludan had to pause his studies due to an accident where he was hit by a car while cycling and had to go through brain surgery.  Policies and demonstrations  Rasmus Paludan and his party represent strong extremist views on Islam and non-western immigration. Paludan is extremely opposed to non-Western immigration and Islam's presence in Denmark. He is well known for his numerous happenings and political demonstrations, often in areas with many Muslim immigrants. During these demonstrations he has presented anti-immigrant and racist statements and taunted Muslims (and Islam as a whole) who have shown up to show their opposition to him. At his protests, Paludan has burned the Quran and defaced it in other ways that many Muslims find offensive. Videos of the subsequent confrontations are shared on YouTube where his party has gathered a large following. Rasmus Paludan calls for putting expelled foreign citizens unwilling and unable to travel back to their country in detention camps in North-Eastern Greenland. In June 2020, Paludan held a demonstration in Aarhus, when a 52-year-old man pulled out a knife, entered the cordoned-off area, and ran towards Paludan. Police fired a warning shot but the assailant did not lay down his weapon whereupon police open fired and wounded the assailant in the leg. In the aftermath, there was unrest in the area. Police were hit by fireworks and rocks were thrown by other assailants in the Gellerup area of Aarhus. Controversies In January 2013, Paludan was given a 5-year restraining order, forbidding him from contact a then 24-year-old man whom he had been stalking since 2010, when they both started at the University of Copenhagen. Despite the restraining order, the harassment continued until December 2013. In 2015 Paludan was fined for offending the police officer who handled the stalking case. Paludan has stated a desire to ban Islam in Denmark and to deport all Muslims from the country, reportedly for the preservation of its ethnic community. In April 2019, Paludan held a demonstration in Viborg, which led to chaos when 100 people showed up. Three people were arrested and, in June 2019, a 24-year-old Syrian was sentenced to 60 days in jail for having thrown a rock at Paludan. He was also to be deported after the jail term and was banned from returning to Denmark for six years. In connection with a planned Quran burning in Malm√∂ in August 2020, Paludan was banned from entering Sweden for two years.https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/paludan- stoppades-vid-gransen-har-fatt-inreseforbud  References  Anti- Muslim sentiment Critics of Islam Living people 21st-century Danish lawyers Opposition to Islam in Denmark Political party founders People convicted of racial hatred offences 1982 births ","title":"Rasmus Paludan"},{"id":"60543746","text":"KEMR may refer to: * KEMR (AM), a radio station (1090 AM) licensed to serve Milan, New Mexico, United States * KEMR (Utah), a defunct radio station (102.1 FM) formerly licensed to serve Castle Dale, Utah, United States * KVVF, a radio station (105.7 FM) licensed to serve Santa Clara, California, United States, which held the call sign KEMR in 2002 and from 2003 to 2004 * KSOL, a radio station (98.9 FM) licensed to serve San Francisco, California, which held the call sign KEMR from 2002 to 2003 ","title":"KEMR"},{"id":"60543753","text":"Central United is a semi-professional association football club based in Central Province, Papua New Guinea.

One year after being crowned king, he intervened in a conflict against Aonghas √ìg, a noble of Clan Donald who was revolting against the rule of his father, John of Islay. James' support for John came too late, and in 1489 Aonghas defeated his father to become the head of Clan Donald and lord of the Scottish Isles. Though his ally had been defeated, James used the clan dispute as an opportunity to exert its authority over the isles and invaded. Before fighting could begin in earnest, Aonghas was assassinated, allowing for James and his allies to easily gain control over the Scottish Isles. Using the crushed rebellion as a pretext, James asserted personal control over the region by personally claiming the title of Lord of the Isles in 1493. In doing so, James replaced Clan Donald as the major geopolitical force in the region. Aonghas' son young son Donald Dubh was captured during the conflict and imprisoned by Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll. Nearly a decade after James' victory over Clan Donald, Og's son Donald Dubh escaped captivity with the help of Torquil MacLeod and revolted against the Scottish Crown, seeking to restore his clan's control over the islands and reclaim the title of Lord of the Isles. His initially rebellion lasted from 1501 to 1505, and saw Donald gain some territory before being defeated and recaptured. Dubh would remain imprisoned until 1543, when he was released. During the intervening years, the Scottish Crown officially annexed the Scottish Isles, declaring them personal lands of the Crown and establishing military garrisons in the region. These actions angered many of the Islanders, who viewed this loss of autonomy as an overreach of the Crown's power. = Second rebellion = Upon being released, Dubh sought to assert his control over Clan Donald and the Scottish Isles. Coordinating a network of various clans and Scottish nobles, he and large parts of the Scottish isles revolted against the Scottish Crown, which was controlled by regents for the young Mary, Queen of Scots. Dubh was promised military and financial support by Henry VIII of England, who was aggressively hoping to force the Scottish Crown to form a Political Union with England. The rebellion was also supported by members of the Irish nobility that were aligned with Henry. Dubh and his allies chose to launch their invasion of Scotland while camped in Ireland, where they were pledged support by the local nobility. With the rebellion having begun, Dubh promised to raise 8,000 men and 180 galleys to fight against the Scottish Crown. His force‚Äîwhich was still camped in Ireland, awaiting the right time to invade the Scottish Isles‚Äîwas planned to be supplemented by 2,000 men provided by Henry and his Irish allies. Combined, this force outnumbered the Scottish Royal forces. However, the rebel's numbers remained hypothetical; Dubh was unable to gather the full support of the Scottish Isles, and Henry's Irish allies were unprepared to raise the 2,000 men he promised. Disputes over payments also led to divisions opening in the allied army. Instead of the 10,000 man force expected to invade, the army that sailed for Scotland numbered some 2,000 men. This force failed to make any major territorial gains, and Dubh retreated to Ireland in late 1545, where he died of a fever. With the death of the rebellion's leader, the various rebels fighting in the Scottish isles either subsided or lost all coordination. In the period of infighting that followed, the Scottish Crown and its allies were able to restore royal control over the islands. The failure of Dubh's Rebellion marked the end of any attempts to restore the Scottish Isles' independence.

She writes on aesthetics, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of mind and theory of emotions. She has published two monographs, one edited collection, and numerous peer reviewed articles. She is on the editorial Board for the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism and was on the editorial board for Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. She was president of the American Society of Aesthetics from 2009 until 2013. In 2007 she was a Leverhulme Visiting Professor of Philosophy at the University of Nottingham and in 2006 she received a Rieveschl Award for Scholarly and/or Creative Works. She received the National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship in September 2002. She was interviewed by Hans Maes for his book Conversations on Art and Aesthetics, which also contains her portrait by American photographer Steve Pyke. Debates in Aesthetics, an open access journal published by the British Society of Aesthetics, dedicated Vol. 14 No. 1 to her work.  Career  Jenefer Robinson has published widely on topics related to philosophy of art, literature and music. In Deeper than Reason: Emotion and its Role in Literature, Music and Art (Oxford University Press, 2005) she developed a new theory of emotion and its connection with the arts. In the book she claims that we not only \\"self-evidently make emotional responses in the presence of art works, but that some art works (...) need to be experienced emotionally if they are to be properly understood\\". In her edited collection Music and Meaning (Cornell University Press, 1997) she brings together ten essays on the nature of musical meaning.

The concept of Tribal Sub-Plans was introduced in the Fifth Five Year Plan (1974-1979) and implementation commenced in 17 states and 2 union territories.

Fifty women are employed to create an all-female daily mix of news, politics and lifestyle shows. Zan means 'woman' in Dari, the variety of Persian spoken in Afghanistan. . with a staff of 50 women, primarily in their 20s. Upon its founding, about half of the women hired for the station were already qualified, and the other half planned to learn on the job. This was because most Afghan media and TV companies would not historically hire women, so they had limited opportunities to develop media skills beforehand. Staff have included Nasrine Nawa, director of news programming, Yasamin Yarmal, host of the daily show, Khalida Rashid, a political reporter, Shabana Noori, a news anchor, and Mehria Azali, a journalist. Topics covered on the station often focus on the interests of Afghan millennial women, such feminism, reproductive rights, domestic violence, women in the workplace, family life, cosmetics (previously banned in Afghanistan), cooking (via a daily cooking show), and sports (previously banned in Afghanistan). Interviews with Afghan female politicians and activists, such as Fareeda Kuchi Balkhi and Selay Ghaffar, are also included on programs. Within three months of its founding, Samar reported that the station had 90,000 viewers for its morning programs. As written in the Guardian upon its founding, \\"It‚Äôs a radical initiative for a country where the television industry is run solely by men and where just 16 years ago, journalism and even access to education for women were banned.\\" However, some journalists are worried for their safety, and some face criticism from their families and communities.

A year later in 2017, the Super5000 series was later created by former Supercars CEO James Warburton, as part of his plan to sustain growth of motorsport in Australia. The series would originally be used as a support category for the Supercars series, alongside the Super2 and SuperUtes series. The creation of this series led to controversy, and the founder of Formula Thunder 5000, Chris Lambden, disapproved of the idea, claiming it would threaten his own plans. Later that same year, both series announced a merger in a bid to further ensure the return of a formula racing series in Australia. The formation of the S5000 series came as a result, and would incorporate technical elements from both the Formula Thunder 5000 and the Super5000 series.  Car specification  The S5000 car's chassis is based on a FIA-compliant Formula 3 bespoke chassis manufactured by French motorsport company Onroak-Ligier. The car uses a 5.0-litre naturally-aspirated quad-cam Ford Coyote V8 that is modified by InnoV8, and has an output of and of torque. All of the power is driven by a 6-speed gearbox by Holinger. Holinger also supplies the transaxle. The suspension set and the wing package are supplied by Borland Racing Developments, and are then fabricated by Garry Rogers Motorsport, who also perform the assembly of the S5000 car. The tyres are supplied by Hoosier. The S5000 car has been certified by the FIA under the 2018 safety certification. The S5000 car made its first public appearance taking part in demonstration runs at the 2018 Newcastle 500 Supercars event with drivers such as Greg Murphy, John Bowe, and Garth Tander going behind the wheel. The race car received a positive reaction from the audience.  Race schedule  A preliminary schedule was originally announced in 2018, with Sydney Motorsport Park as the season opener. However, in April 2019, the organisers announced that the series would be delayed four months and that the series would instead kick off in September 2019 at Sandown Raceway, due to supply issues from the United States. The organisers also wanted to ensure that the S5000 car would be properly tested.  Media coverage  The races are to be aired on free-to- air television on TV channel 7, and they will also be live-streamed by website Motorsport.com through their Motorsport.TV platform.

Pettway (born 1929) is an American artist associated with the Gee's Bend group of quilters. In 2006 her quilt Bars and string-pieced columns appeared on a US Postal service stamp as part of a series commemorating Gee's Bend quilters. Her work is included in the collection of the Art Institute Chicago and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.  Life  A woman of many names, Jessie T. Pettway was given the name J.T. at birth, most called her by her nickname, \\"Bootnie,\\" and she always referred to herself as \\"Jessie,\\" after her favorite school teacher. She was born in Primrose, Alabama to a single mother, Channie Pettway. Although she knew her father, Joe Benning, and passed his house frequently, he did not play an active role in her or her siblings' lives. Her mother died at a young age, and her and her siblings lived with her mother's sister, Seebell Kennedy (\\"Little Sis\\"), and her husband, Alp Kennedy, thereafter. Their days were long and filled with chores before and after school. Their farm grew cotton, corn, peas, peanuts, and sweet potatoes, as well as the variety of vegetables they were on their own plot for subsistence use. They also raised livestock, such as goats and hogs. Pettway completed schooling up to the eleventh grade. She married Monroe Pettway and together they raised seven girls and two boys.  Work  After the farm chores were completed, their aunt Seebell would sit the girls down and teach them to piece and sew quilts. Jessie's first quilt was an \\"Eight Pointed Star\\" pattern. She began completing patterns by herself at age twelve. Always using repurposed cloth and materials given to her from community members or her family in Mobile, Alabama, Jessie recalled, \\"My aunt had a old book of patterns that she sometime used, but I didn't like no book patterns. I couldn't buy pretty materials, so I couldn't make pretty patterns.\\" She often preferred the \\"Bricklayer\\" pattern because \\"you could make it into something pretty with any old kind of cloth.\\" References 1929 births 20th-century American women artists 20th-century American artists Quilters Artists from Alabama Living people ","title":"Jessie T.

IWRG has used the Triangular de la Muerte concept intermittently over the years, but not on a regular schedule. The eponymous \\"Triangle of Death\\" match was a three-way, three-trios match where one wrestler would be forced to unmask at the end of the show under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. The trios were 1) Black Terry, Dr. Cerebro, and Eternus, 2) Atomic Star, Canis Lupus, and Eterno and 3) Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47, and Pikachu. In the end, Pikachu was forced to unmask as his team lost the match, revealing his real name in the process. The show also included a 'Copa Higher Power torneo cibernetico elimination match between trainees from IWRG's school and the \\"Gym Zeus\\" trainees and three additional matches. Production =Background= The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has Triangular de la Muerte (Spanish for \\"Triangle of Death\\") matches on several occasions since its creation in 1997. Traditionally Luchas de Apuestas (\\"bet matches\\") are contested as either singles or tag team matches, but IWRG has used a hybrid version featuring three wrestlers or three teams all \\"betting\\" something on the match. In another deviation from tradition IWRG often chooses to have one participant risk their championship instead of their mask or their hair. Their only Triangular de la Muerte show in 2016 was held on February 14, 2016 in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico where IWRG holds almost all of their major lucha libre shows. =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event The opening match featured four women who do not regularly work for IWRG, as they have no steady women's roster, as Diosa Atenea and Sexy Girl defeated Lady Drago and Lilith Dark two falls to one. In the second match of the night the trio of Acero, Adrenalina, Guerrero 2000 defeated Blue Monsther, Omega, Voltar in the first best two-out-of-three falls six-man tag team match of the show. In the third match of the night Aram√≠s defeated Yoruba. Enigma. Voraz and Aeroman when he pinned Aeroman. The 2015 Copa Higher Power featured students from IWRG's wrestling school Future Idolos de Lucha Libre (FILL) and a team representing trainees from Gym ZEUS. The FILL team consisted of Alas de Acero, Aramis, Ara√±a de Plata, Chapulin, Fresero Jr., Kanon, Shadow Boy and, Sniper while the Gym ZEUS team were represented by Atomic Fly, Espada De Plata, Fly Star, Galaxy, Keiser Drago, Marduck Jr., Salchichita, and Toxin Boy. The torneo cibernetico elimination match came down to Ara√±a de Plata from FILL and Toxin Boy from ZEUS. Ara√±a de Plata pinned Toxic Boy to win the match for his team. In the Triangular de la Muerte match two well established IWRG regulars each teamed up with a relative newcomer for the match. Los Insoportables (\\"The Unbearable\\"; Canis Lupus and Eterno) teamed up with Atomic Star. Los Oficiales (Oficial 911 and Oficial AK-47) teamed up with Pikachu while Los Cerebros Negros (\\"The Black Brains\\"; Black Terry and Dr. Cerebro) teamed up with Eternus who made his debut on the show. For the first part of the match, all three teams faced off, with Los Cerebros Negos and Eternus gaining the first pinfall, which meant they survived the match without having to risk their hair. For the last match, a coin toss was used to determine the captain for each team, the person who would have to unmask or get their hair shaved off in case of a loss. Atomic Star and Pikachu were designated as the captains, the only 2 wrestlers in the match to wear a mask., During the final minutes of the match all six wrestlers were fighting outside the ring, with Eterno making sure Atomic Star returned to the ring before the count of 20, thus winning by count out. After the match, Pikachu unmasked and revealed his real name, Marco Antonio Guillen Soto, that he was 30 years old and had been a wrestler 8 years at that point in time.

History  The club was founded shortly before the 2019 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League season, with the aim to 'promote peace' in the Bougainville region, according to coach David Passam. The club recruited players from Port Moresby Soccer Association champions Mungkas and University Inter, as well as four from the Bougainville region itself. The club was then drawn into the Southern Conference. The club was handed a tough start to the season, going up against eight-time champions Hekari United on the opening day, and played well in a 1‚Äì0 defeat. They registered their first win on the second weekend of the season with a 2‚Äì1 victory over former runners-up Eastern Stars, but were inconsistent throughout the first half of the season, winning three games and losing three, with a solitary draw against struggling Southern Strikers. By the half-way stage of the season, the club sat fourth in the league. Another narrow 1‚Äì0 defeat to Hekari followed, before a damaging 2‚Äì1 defeat against playoff rivals Central United threatened to derail their qualification hopes. However, victories against Port Moresby United and Star Mountain left them one point off qualification with two games to play.

The colonies are \\"light yellow, circular, smooth, convex, glistening, with entire margins.\\" K. huaxiensis is found in the urinary tract of humans. The earliest recorded encounter with this pathogen was in 2017 at West China Medical Center of Sichuan University. The pathogen was discovered in a urine sample of a patient suffering from a urinary tract infection. K. huaxiensis is characterized by being negative for malonate, urease, ornithine decarboxylase, and the Voges‚ÄìProskauer test. The bacterium is positive for \\"indole, lysine, decarboxylase, lactose, mannitol, and the ONPG test.\\" While distinct, K. huaxiensis has 76.86%-87.18% average nucleotide identity with strains from all known Klebsiella and Raoultella species. Genome analysis reveals that the GC- content of K. huaxiensis is 53.3%.

The phylogroup includes K. grimontii, K. michiganensis, and K. oxytoca. Through 16S RNA sequences, K. huaxiensis has been found to be the most similar to K. oxytoca (98.5%).

Often attributed to the noir-style New York City photographer Weegee, it has come to represent a philosophy in which, on occasion, action is more important than reflection. Background Before digital photography, in what Kathy Day called the \\"heyday of photojournalism, before auto-focus and pixels\\", spot photography (known to contemporaries as \\"moment photography\\") was popular. This attempted to epitomise an entire visual story through a single photograph taken either as the event was occurring or immediately after. Situations that lent themselves particularly well to this approach were criminal activity (particularly that of the Mafia and organised crime) and accidents and car crashes. =Weegee= The expression has been attributed‚Äîprobably apocryphally‚Äîto the American photographer Arthur Fellig, more popularly known as Weegee, who has been described as \\"the famous spot news photographer of the mid-20th century\\". Known for stark black and white‚Äî\\"searing chiaroscuro\\"‚Äîphotography, Weegee used a \\"big, flash-popping Speed Graphic\\" although Terry Teachout has suggested that he probably used ∆í/16, that being the lowest aperture in general use. =Philosophy= The philosophy has been explained thus: Effectively it emphasises less reliance on high technology and more reliance on average settings and personal skill, as well as portraying the story accurately and graphically. Diagram of decreasing apertures with conversely increasing ∆í-numbers, in one-stop increments; each aperture has half the light-gathering area of the previous one. It is akin, says the photographer Douglas Peebles, in its simplicity and obviousness to the advice \\"if you want to be famous for photographing famous people, begin by photographing famous people\\". It is being there, said \\"that predisposes luck in the photographer's favour\\". The Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications has suggested that while the \\"∆í/8 and be there\\" tactic was sensationalist, it was also, by the same token, more likely to win the photographer awards. It epitomises the popularity of lurid newspaper reports which were giving tabloids extremely large circulations and also how journalism was increasingly being influenced by the theatrics of Hollywood. The photography author Ken Kobre has summed it up as \\"check human tragedy first. Concentrate on the human element of any tragedy. Readers relate to people pictures.\\" Specs ∆í/8 is considered in photography to be a general- purpose aperture (\\"that never fails\\", commented the magazine editor Richard Stolley in 2009). With the aperture set to ∆í/8 (allowing sufficient light to enter for exposure but not so much as to bleach the picture) and the lens set to the hyperfocal distance‚Äîwhich results in a sharply-focussed depth of field whether taking pictures up close or at great distances. ∆í/8 allows sufficient depth of field and lens speed for good, clear exposure in most daylight situations. Cultural touchstone The expression, wrote Michigan Daily photojournalist Andy Sacks, summed up \\"everything a successful news photographer needed to know\\". It has been particularly advocated for street and outdoor photography, particularly mountain stereography and wildlife. It has also become a mantra for non-photography disciplines and hobbies, for example self-help philosophies.

He has been an archbishop since 2002. Education and Priestly Service Ivo Scapolo was born 24 July 1953 in Terrassa Padovana, Province of Padua. He was ordained a priest on 4 June 1978 in Padua. After earning a doctorate in canon law, he entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See on 1 May 1984. He filled positions in the offices representing the Holy See in Angola, Portugal, and the United States, and worked in Rome in the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State. Diplomatic Career On 26 March 2002, Pope John Paul II named him Apostolic Nuncio to Bolivia and titular archbishop of Tagaste. He received his episcopal consecration on 12 May from Cardinal Angelo Sodano. On 17 January 2008, Pope Benedict XVI named him Apostolic Nuncio to Rwanda, and on 15 July 2011 Apostolic Nuncio to Chile. =Chile= Scapolo played little role in resolving the clerical abuse crisis that brought intense Vatican scrutiny to Chile and the early retirement of several bishops. Several victims of clerical sexual abuse claimed he had long participated in preventing their claims from being heard. One of them, Juan Carlos Cruz, complained that Scapolo never met with victims of abuse and described him as \\"a blind guy, who does not hear the victims or have an interest in them\\". Scapolo defended his role in the 2015 appointment of Juan Barros Madrid to be Bishop of Osorno, saying no information had been withheld from Vatican authorities. Nevertheless, Father Sergio Perez de Arce, whom Pope Francis named Apostolic Administrator of San Bartolome de Chill√°n as part of his reform of the Chilean hierarchy, said Scapolo \\"has not been and will not be the person with the sensitivity and skills needed to support a church in crisis like the Chilean one\\". When Chile inaugurated its president in March 2018, the Holy See was represented by both Scapolo and Nicola Girasoli, the Apostlic Nuncio to Peru, which, according to La Tercera, church observers read as a sign that Scapolo was out of favor with the Vatican. He received criticism in Chile for his link to controversial Bishop appointments, including the appointment of Madrid, who was criticized for his connection to Fr. Fernando Karadima, who had been accused by multiple people of sexual misconduct. Some alleged victims claimed that Barros was present during Karadima's sexual acts, with one even saying that he participated in them.https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the- americas/2019/08/30/nuncio-linked-to-controversial-appointments-leaves-chile- in-nicaragua-government-targets-church/  Sexual abuse scandal  Regarding the sexual abuse scandals in Chile, Scapolo stated that it was \\"painful to see a reality of abuses in the Church\\" and the he \\"we should all feel anger, pain and shame if someone commits an abuse, even more if it is against a minor, and moreover if it is committed by a person who, like the priest, has a special responsibility.\\" After the Pope's visit to Chile Scapolo admitted that he faced \\"an avalanche of denunciations, petitions and complaints\\" and that he thinks he has \\"done what is humanly possible to face it. I tried to act in accordance with the truth, justice and charity.\\" = Portugal = Pope Francis named him Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal on 29 August 2019. His appointment to the diplomatic post in Portugal was well received by the Portuguese Episcopal Conference who welcomed the appointment and wished to Bishop Ivo Scapolo ‚Äúa fruitful pastoral ministry as representative of the Holy See to the Church in Portugal and in diplomatic relations with the Portuguese State‚Äù. In a note sent to the Portuguese catholic news agency, ECCLESIA, the Portuguese Episcopal Conference also expressed hope that Bishop Scapolo exercised his duties as a \\"Man of God, of the Church, of apostolic zeal, of reconciliation, of the Pope, of initiative, obedience, prayer, active charity, humility.\\"  Views  = Role of women = When asked about the importance of the role of women in the Catholic Church and whether their role should be reviewed and re-analyzed, Scapolo stated his experience and time spent in Chile where women give a big contribution to Christian communities. Furthermore, Scapolo states that the Church is born when Mary says \\"yes\\" and therefore he expected that the role and responsibility of women in the catholic Church should be reflected upon.

The focal point of the M√°scara vs. Caballera series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. For the August 2016 M√°scara vs. Caballera event the masked Canis Lupus put his mask on the line against M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr.'s hair in the main event. Canis Lupus was helped to victory both by El Hijo de Dos Caras and Trauma I both hitting M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. with a steel chair. After the event M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. was shaved bald while Trauma I and Canis Lupus both agreed to put their mask on the line at IWRG's next major show, M√°scara vs. M√°scara. In the semi-main event Trauma I defeated Mr. Electro to win the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. The show included four additional matches. Production =Background= In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event Demonio Infernal was originally scheduled to wrestle Omega in the opening match of the show, but instead Skanda was moved down from the second match to wrestle, and defeat Omega. Instead Demonio Infernal took Skanda's spot in the second match, teaming with Violencia Jr. to defeat Black Drag√≥n and Drag√≥n Fly, two falls to one. The third match was the first best two-out-of-three falls six-man tag team match of the night, the most prevalent match form in Mexico. The trio of Black Terry, Cerebro Negro and Dr. Cerebro, collectively known as Los Cerebros Negros (\\"The Black Brains\\") wrestled constant rivals Los Mariachis Locos (\\"The Crazy Mariachis\\"; Diablo Jr., El Hijo del Diablo and Imposible. Los Cerebros won the match when one of them hit Diablo Jr. below the belt without being noticed by the referee and then pinning him. For the fourth match El Hijo de Dos Caras teamed up with the father/son team of Negro Navarro and Trauma I to take on Herodes Jr., Rel√°mpago, and Silver King. El Hijo de Dos Caras won the third and deciding fall when he pinned Silver King, although Silver King complained afterward that it was not a three count and asked for a rematch against El Hijo de Dos Caras. Both the semi-final and final match of the evening continued an ongoing four-way storyline feud between Trauma I, Mr. Electro, Canis Lupus and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. that had started months earlier. In the semi-final match, Mr. Electro put the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on the line against Trauma I. Canis Lupus came to ringside near the end of the match and fouled Mr. Electro, allowing Trauma I to win the championship. For the final match M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. was accompanied to ringside by El Hijo de Dos Caras, while Canis Lupus did not have a corner-man initially. During the match El Hijo de Dos Caras accidentally hit M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. with a steel chair, followed by Trauma I running to ringside, hitting M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. with a steel chair as well, allowing Canis Lupus to win the match and retain his mask. After M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. was shaved bald, both Trauma I and Canis Lupus agreed to put their masks on the line at IWRG's next big show in September, M√°scara vs. M√°scara. Aftermath Trauma I ended up defeating Canis Lupus as the M√°scara vs. M√°scara show, forcing Canis Lupus to unmask and reveal his real name, H√©ctor L√≥pez. Trauma I's reign as IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion lasted for 134 days, until August 7, 2017 where he lost the championship to Mr Electro.

It contains chemicals that are being researched for possible use as antimicrobials, as larvicides and as cytotoxins. Description Dictyota bartayresiana grows to a height of , being anchored to the seabed by a variably-shaped holdfast surrounded by rhizoids. The blades are flat and branch dichotomously. The thallus is wide below each junction and wide just above; the sections are long and have no midrib. The margins of the blade are entire and the tips rounded in young fronds and pointed in older ones. The sporangia are 125 to 140 ¬µm in diameter. Distribution and habitat This seaweed is found in the tropical western central Pacific Ocean and the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico. It occurs at depths down to about . Research Several diterpenes and other secondary metabolites are present in D. bartayresiana. The methanolic and chloroform extracts of the seaweed exhibit antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the petroleum extract exhibits a similar effect against Morganella morganii. The methanolic extract is also effective as a larvicide against the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, and shows toxicity to the nauplii larvae of brine shrimps, a proxy for antitumour activity. This means that the seaweed shows promise as a broad spectrum antibacterial, a larvicide and a cytotoxic substance. Further research is needed to identify the active ingredients responsible for these effects. Ecology The diterpenes contained in this alga are distasteful to fish, which avoid eating the seaweed. Pseudamphithoides incurvaria, a species of amphipod, feeds on the seaweed and builds a \\"domicile\\" from fragments of the fronds, and lives inside this. This casing deters potential fish predators from eating the amphipod.

It was fought near Cretopolis in Pisidia (a region of Asia Minor) in 319 BC and resulted in another stunning Antigonid victory (the second one that year).Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 44‚Äì45; Polyainos, strategemata IV 6,7. Background After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals immediately began squabbling over his huge empire. Soon the squabbling degenerated into open warfare, with each general attempting to claim a portion of Alexander's vast Empire. One of the most talented successor generals (Diadochi) was Antigonus Monophthalmus, so called because of an eye he lost in a siege. After the second partition of the Empire, the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Antipater, the new regent of the Empire, made Antigonus strategos of Asia and charged him with hunting down and defeating the remnants of the Perdiccan faction. Antigonus took command of the Royal Army and after being reinforced with more reliable troops from Antipater's European army he marched against their enemies in Asia-Minor.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.72. He first marched into Cappadocia against Eumenes whom he defeated at the battle of Orkynia. Eumenes escaped to the fortress of Nora where Antigonus invested him.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.77; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 41, 1‚Äì3; Plutarch, Eumenes, 10,2‚Äì4. Prelude Leaving the siege of Nora to a subordinateRichard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.77; Diodorus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 41, 5‚Äì7; Plutarch, Eumenes, 10,2‚Äì4. Antigonus then marched against the remaining Perdiccans who had gathered their forces in Pisidia near town called Cretopolis. Alketas (a brother of Perdiccas), Attalos (Perdiccas brother-in- law), Polemon (Attalos's brother) and Dokimos had gathered their forces in a passPolyainos, strategemata IV 6,7. near Cretopolis. Antigonos decided to use the element of surprise, and forcemarched his army to Cretopolis in seven days (a march of close to 300 miles).Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 44,2. In this way Antigonus took his enemies by complete surprise: the first warning they had that Antigonus was nearby was the trumpeting of his elephants. Antigonus occupied a couple of hills overlooking Alketas's position. Battle The Perdiccans were caught totally unprepared, they faced an assault in front and along the pass, and in the flank from the hills overlooking the pass. Leaving Attalos and Dokimos to draw up the phalanx, Alketas took the cavalry and the peltasts and attacked Antigonus's troops on the ridge, trying desperately to dislodge them.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.79. During the fight for the ridge Antigonus charged with 6,000 cavalry into the pass and caught Alketas in the flank; at this Alketas was forced back from the ridge and just barely made it back to the phalanx, with the loss of most of his men.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 44,4‚Äì5. Unfortunately for the Perdiccans they did not have enough time to get their phalanx drawn up, and facing Antigonus's cavalry charge their men simply surrendered.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 45,2; Polyainos, Strategemata, IV 6.7. Aftermath Alketas managed to escape with a guard of Pisidians, who were particularly loyal to him, and made his way to almost impregnable city of Termessos (here he would commit suicide when he heard the people of the city planned to hand him over to Antigonus); His colleagues Attalos, Polemon and Dokimos were captured by Antigonus, along with the rest of the army, close to 16,000 foot and 900 horse.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 45,1‚Äì4. Antigonus could now claim to have destroyed the Perdiccan faction, but unfortunately for him Eumenes was not done causing trouble (see: Second War of the Diadochi).

Background Izz al-din Shir was described historically as being \\"of the line of Senek'erim\\", referring to Senekerim- Hovhannes Artsruni, the final ruler of the Kingdom of Vaspurakan. Given Shir's Kurdish heritage, it is likely that this Armenian ancestry was matrilineal, i.e. his mother or grandmother may have been an Artsrunid princess. Such intermarriages between Christian Armenian nobles and Muslim ruling families were not uncommon due to the mutual political benefits they provided. Alternatively, Armenians have been known to refer to other Armenians who had converted to Islam as ‚ÄúKurds‚Äù. It may therefore be that Izz al-din Shir simply belonged to an Islamised branch of the Artsrunid royal family. His father may have been a certain Malik Izz al-din, who had commissioned the Halima Khatun Mausoleum (likely for his mother) in Vostan in 1335. Life The exact year in which Izz al-din Shir began his reign is uncertain. In 1384, he appears to have been allied with Sultan Ahmad of the Jalairid Sultanate. Sultan Ahmad, then threatened by both Qara Mahammad of the Qara Qoyunlu and Tokhtamysh, Khan of the Golden Horde, was led to safety by Shir through the latter's domains to the Jalairid capital of Baghdad. In 1387, Izz al-din Shir was besieged at a fortress in Tushpa by the forces of the Central Asian conqueror Timur. He was later captured and bound by Timur, who allegedly had many of the defenders of the stronghold enslaved or executed. Shir himself was spared and later had his authority restored under Timurid suzerainty. In 1392, Shir had the province of Vostan captured from his brother Malik Assad. The following year, the Catholicos of Aghtamar, Zak'aria II, was stoned to death on his orders. Now as Timur's ally, Shir began assisting the conqueror in his wars against Qara Muhammad's son Qara Yusuf. In 1395, he was recorded as having engaged the Qara Qoyunlu forces for several days, in reward for which he was awarded lands by Timur. However in 1398, he was captured by Qara Yusuf, who had him imprisoned on Akdamar Island whilst he ransacked his lands. By the time of Timur's death in 1405 and the subsequent weakening of Timurid authority, Shir had switched allegiance to Qara Yusuf. Though he seems to have disliked the Turkomans, he is recorded to have acted as an intermediary during a dispute between them and the Shirvanshahs. By 1412, Izz al-din Shir had begun surrendering his rule to his son, Malik Muhammad, on account of his advanced age. However, he still appears to have been the Hakkari ruler de jure, with Armenian scribes continuing to refer to Malik Muhammad under his father's name. When Timur's successor Shah Rukh reconquered the region in 1421, Izz al-din Shir was among the nobles and dignitaries who visited him in his winter quarters in Qarabagh to offer their fealty. Malik Muhammad did the same soon after when the conqueror visited the Lake Van region. When Qara Yusuf's son Qara Iskander temporarily regained control of the area, Shir refused to recognise his rule, a policy followed by his successors. Izz al-din Shir died two years later, in 1423.

The house has an unusual roof design, with a lateral ridgebeam extending beyond left and right gables, hip roofs on either side of a prominent, front facing gable, and a lower hip roof above a cross facade porch. Double notch rafters project from lateral eaves and from cantilevered window bays with shed roofs below the side facing gables. Narrow clapboard siding covers exterior walls. The front porch is supported by square posts with geometric, dropped caps. Tourtellotte & Hummel had used the square post decorations in other Bungalow houses, and a more elaborate example is found on the porch of the William Sidenfaden House (1912) in Boise. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. With Ernest F. Hunt Ernest F. Hunt (September 17, 1871-- October 16, 1933) moved from Boise to Meridian in 1908, purchasing the mercantile business of L.K. Deck on Broadway Avenue. A 1913 fire at the business destroyed most of Hunt's inventory, but he temporarily reopened the store at Meridian's I.O.O.F. building. The Hunt family moved into their 8-room bungalow in 1913, and a year later Hunt leased a 160-acre ranch five miles from Meridian, owned by the Riedel Brothers. In 1915, Hunt and his partner Robert Pfost organized the Meridian Produce Company. Pfost later married Hunt's daughter, Hazel. In 1923, Hunt and Pfost organized the Meridian Produce and Cold Storage Company, a poultry processing plant with a daily capacity of 15,000 chickens. The Hunts leased the C.L.

Despite the entrance of billionaire and founder of the Reform Party Ross Perot the next day Lamm continued his campaign and announced that millionaire and former Representative Ed Zschau would be his vice presidential candidate. In the Reform Party mail-in ballot primaries Lamm took three states and Washington, D.C. and had half the support of Perot. Afterwards he appeared and gave a speech at the convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania and refused to endorse Perot or accept the vice presidential nomination. Background In 1974 Lamm was elected to the governorship of Colorado and would become infamous for his dire predictions for social security and healthcare which earned him the nickname \\"Governor Gloom\\".New York Times, \\"Gov. Lamm asserts elderly, if very ill, have 'duty to die'\\", March 29, 1984. In 1992 Lamm was defeated in the Democratic primary for the Senate election and started his drift from the Democratic Party. That same year in the 1992 Perot became the most successful third party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 with 18.91% of the popular vote as an independent and in six states was placed on the ballot on newly formed political parties. In the early nineties multiple independence parties under the leadership of United We Stand America formed with ballot access due to Perot's success in 1992 and in 1995 joined together to form the Reform Party. Throughout the development of the new party Perot stated that he would not seek its presidential nomination and left it open to other candidates. Speculation arose that Lamm would run for the nomination after Newsweek ran a story claiming that Perot had contacted Lamm and asked him to seek the nomination. In June Lamm appeared at the California affiliate's convention with Perot where he gave a speech supporting cutting Social Security and Medicare and stated that he would be interested in running for the Reform Party nomination if Perot chose not to. Lamm later said that if he was nominated by the Reform Party he would accept and run as their candidate. A major problem for the Reform Party would be funding and if Perot was not the candidate he would not be allowed to give more than $1,000 to a campaign, however a workaround was speculated with Lamm being the presidential nominee and Perot being the vice presidential nominee which would allow him to play a lesser role in the campaign while still financially backing it up. Another speculated workaround was selecting billionaire Tom Golisano, founder of the Independence Party of New York and its gubernatorial candidate, who was interested in appearing on the Reform Party ticket and stated that \\"If Dick Lamm needs some help in an effort to be competitive, I probably would help him, sure,\\". Announcement On July 9, 1996 Lamm held a press conference in Denver, Colorado where he announced his intention to run for the Reform Party's presidential nomination and stated his five rules for the next millennium as stopping injustice for the next generation, ending taxation without representation, stopping reckless borrowing, establishing a self- responsibility ethic, and restoring trust in the government. Lamm's announcement was overshadowed when the next day Perot announced that he had changed his decision and announced that he would also be running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination on Larry King Live. However, despite the funding and name recognition advantage Perot had Lamm chose not to withdraw stating that \\"These people (party members) are bigger than Perot. Even if he runs, I stand a chance,\\". Campaign developments Shortly after both of their campaign announcements Lamm and Perot met in Augusta, Maine to encourage Reform Party members to meet the deadline for mailing in candidate preference surveys. After Perot's speech half of the audience left before Lamm's speech. Later Lamm attacked the Reform Party leadership for not giving him the mailing list of the 1.3 million party members even though he had been promised it earlier and Perot had access to the same list. Despite the disadvantages Lamm had against Perot he did manage to secure the 10% needed of the preference vote to appear on the official ballot in August. In early August Lamm announced that former Representative Ed Zschau would be his running mate stating that \\"This is a person of integrity, honesty and common sense,\\". However, despite the addition of millionaire Zschau to the ticket Lamm still suffered from campaign fundraising difficulties, lack of time for campaigning, and was unable to get Perot to agree to a debate. When the official primary ballot results came in Lamm's earlier prediction of him having a one in three chance of winning came true as he took 34.75% of the vote and took the states of Minnesota, Colorado, Alaska and Washington, D.C. and came in a distant last in all but New Mexico, Idaho, and Maryland.

The Qatar National Vision 2030 has three major pillars to development: human, social economic and environmental; this vision provides frameworks that enable the development of different elements within Qatar and its society; one of which is the high importance put on developing and cultivating artistic talents to represent and define Qatar on a global scale. Another important element in developing the movie industry is the influence and vision of Sheikha Al Mayassa who founded Doha Film Institution; the establishment of film as a mode of storytelling was imperative because it serves the purpose of granting Qatar a global presence through the talents that are supported and cultivated because of her initiative. The film industry plays a role in amplifying the Qatari national identity alongside the identity of the Arab world as a whole. Another important entity in cultivating and establishing the film industry in Qatar is the Culture, Arts and Heritage initiative under Qatar‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs which has a strategy that aims to organize and encourage events that focus on providing a foundation for the youth of Qatar to utilize in improving their positioning within the culture.

It was located at the edge of the Terre de Su√®te region (al-Sawad in Arabic). History The fortress was established in 1109 among the ruins of a Byzantine monastic laura following the destruction of the castle al-Al. In 1109, a truce was declared between Baldwin I and Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus, and the surrounding area, Terre de Su√®te, was supposed to be ruled as a condominium by Jerusalem and Damascus. Nevertheless, the castle was attacked by Toghtekin in 1111, killing its Frankish garrison, but was retaken by the Franks two years later. The Muslims captured the castle in 1118 only to lose it in the campaign of Baldwin II that resulted in capture of the entire Yarmouk valley. Nur ad-Din besieged Cave de Sueth in 1158, but retreated with the approach of Baldwin III. In 1182 the castle was captured by Farrukh Shah, the nephew of Saladin, only to return to Frankish control later that year, where it remained until shortly before the conquests of Saladin in 1187.

Researcher Marv Goldberg has claimed that \\"because of their unique role in the recording industry, The Cues probably participated in more hit records than any other group.\\" Biography The group was put together in 1954 by songwriter, pianist, arranger and music executive Jesse Stone, who wanted to establish a regular group of backing singers for the Atlantic label's records. Original members of The Cues included second tenor Ollie Jones (previously of The Ravens) and baritone Winfield Scott (also known as Robie Kirk), soon joined by first tenor Abel DeCosta (previously of The Blenders) and bass Eddie Barnes. They made their first recordings as a group for the Lamp label, a subsidiary of Aladdin Records, but also recorded the same year for Jubilee Records, and - as the Four Students - for RCA Records. As backing singers on Atlantic Records, they recorded with LaVern Baker on \\"Tweedle Dee\\" and \\"Jim Dandy\\"; with Roy Hamilton on \\"Don't Let Go\\"; with Big Joe Turner on \\"Flip, Flop and Fly\\"; and many others. They also featured with Nat \\"King\\" Cole on many of his mid-1950s recordings on Capitol Records. They appeared on both original versions of songs, and cover versions - such as on Georgia Gibbs' cover of \\"Tweedle Dee\\". They also made many demonstration records of songs, which were then sent to record companies on the understanding that the group would provide the back-up for the final record. Marv Goldberg, \\"The Cues\\", UncaMarvy.com. Retrieved April 20, 2019 By mid 1955, after adding second tenor Jimmy Breedlove, who had previously recorded as a solo singer, the group began recording in their own right on Capitol. Their first release on the label was \\"Burn That Candle\\", written by Winfield Scott, but their version was soon overtaken on the charts by a cover version by Bill Haley and His Comets.Bryan Thomas, \\"The Cues\\", Allmusic.com. Retrieved April 20, 2019 The group's most lasting success was with \\"Why\\", a song written by Jesse Stone under his regular pseudonym of Charles Calhoun, which became a local hit. The group were also still providing back-up for the Atlantic roster, and for other labels, and recorded, without Breedlove, as the Four Students for the Groove label, a subsidiary of RCA. In 1956, Scott and Barnes left the group, and were replaced by baritone Luther Dixon, and bass Joseph Smalls (previously of the Blenders). The Cues continued to record for Capitol, but with little commercial success. From 1956, they also toured as part of Buck Ram's \\"Happy Tours\\". Breedlove left the group in 1957 for a solo career, while Winfield Scott, Ollie Jones and Luther Dixon continued as successful songwriters. Abel DeCosta ran an agency finding backing singers for new recordings, before joining a later version of The Ink Spots.

Diagnostic characters Key diagnostic characters of this species include spikelets that are mostly less than 4.0 mm in length, with thin and membranaceous glumes. The plants resemble Schoenus exilis; however, the nutlets of S. quartziticus are broad elliptic, while those of S. exilis are narrow elliptic in shape. Similar to other sedges, plants in this group are very difficult to identify. It appears that part of this problem is caused by the tendency of the southern African Schoenus to form hybrids with each other. It is not clear whether S. quartziticus forms hybrids with other southern African Schoenus species. Squartziticus- head.jpgFlowering head (black scale bar represents 10 mm) Squartziticus- spikelet.jpgSpikelet (black scale bar represents 1 mm) Squartziticus- nutlet.jpgNutlet Taxonomy Schoenus quartziticus is a species in family Cyperaceae, tribe Schoeneae. Other notable genera in tribe Schoeneae include Lepidosperma, Oreobolus, Costularia, Tetraria and Gahnia. The most closely related species to S. quartziticus are other southern African Schoenus species, specifically, species in the S. cuspidatus and allies group that are endemic to the Agulhus Plain and Eastern Cape regions. Southern African Schoenus were once classified as Tetraria; however, based on molecular and morphological differences, we now know that the two groups are evolutionary distinct. To ensure that this group of sedges is monophyletic (i.e. the genus only has closely related species), the southern African Tetraria were transferred into Schoenus. In the field, the southern African Schoenus can be distinguished from Tetraria species by their lack of stem leaves and the absence of reticulate sheaths at the bases of the flowering stems. Distribution and ecology Schoenus quartziticus is currently known to occur in quartz patches on shale-derived soils of the Agulhas Plain region of South Africa. It is likely that only a very few populations of this species remain.

Definition An exponential E on an ordered field K is a strictly increasing isomorphism of the additive group of K onto the multiplicative group of positive elements of K. The ordered field K\\\\, together with the additional function E\\\\, is called an ordered exponential field. Examples * The canonical example for an ordered exponential field is the ordered field of real numbers R with any function of the form a^x where a is a real number greater than 1\\\\. One such function is the usual exponential function, that is . The ordered field R equipped with this function gives the ordered real exponential field, denoted by . It was proved in the 1990s that Rexp is model complete, a result known as Wilkie's theorem. This result, when combined with Khovanskiƒ≠'s theorem on pfaffian functions, proves that Rexp is also o-minimal.A.J. Wilkie, Model completeness results for expansions of the ordered field of real numbers by restricted Pfaffian functions and the exponential function, J. Amer. Math. Soc., 9 (1996), pp. 1051‚Äì1094. Alfred Tarski posed the question of the decidability of Rexp and hence it is now known as Tarski's exponential function problem. It is known that if the real version of Schanuel's conjecture is true then Rexp is decidable.A.J. Macintyre, A.J. Wilkie, On the decidability of the real exponential field, Kreisel 70th Birthday Volume, (2005). * The ordered field of surreal numbers \\\\mathbf{No} admits an exponential which extends the exponential function exp on R. Since \\\\mathbf{No} does not have the Archimedean property, this is an example of a non-Archimedean ordered exponential field. * The ordered field of logarithmic-exponential transseries \\\\mathbb{T}^{LE} is constructed specifically in a way such that it admits a canonical exponential. Formally exponential fields A formally exponential field, also called an exponentially closed field, is an ordered field that can be equipped with an exponential E. For any formally exponential field K, one can choose an exponential E on K such that 1+1/n for some natural number n.Salma Kuhlmann, Ordered Exponential Fields, Fields Institute Monographs, 12, (2000), p. 24. Properties * Every ordered exponential field K is root-closed, i.e., every positive element of K\\\\, has an n-th root for all positive integer n (or in other words the multiplicative group of positive elements of K\\\\, is divisible). This is so because E\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}E^{-1}(a)\\\\right)^n=E(E^{-1}(a))=a for all a>0. * Consequently, every ordered exponential field is a Euclidean field. * Consequently, every ordered exponential field is an ordered Pythagorean field. * Not every real-closed field is a formally exponential field, e.g., the field of real algebraic numbers does not admit an exponential. This is so because an exponential E has to be of the form E(x)=a^x\\\\, for some 1 in every formally exponential subfield K of the real numbers; however, E(\\\\sqrt{2})=a^\\\\sqrt{2} is not algebraic if 1 is algebraic by the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem. * Consequently, the class of formally exponential fields is not an elementary class since the field of real numbers and the field of real algebraic numbers are elementarily equivalent structures. * The class of formally exponential fields is a pseudoelementary class. This is so since a field K\\\\, is exponentially closed if and only if there is a surjective function E_2\\\\colon K\\\\rightarrow K^+ such that E_2(x+y)=E_2(x)E_2(y) and E_2(1)=2; and these properties of E_2 are axiomatizable.

In his research, he frequently collaborates with Fr√©d√©ric Docquier from the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain. = Research on brain drain and skilled migration= Together with Michel Beine and Docquier, Rapoport explores under which conditions brain drain could increase economic growth, arguing that a \\"beneficial brain drain\\" occurs when potential emigrants' additional investments into their education because of hopes for higher returns abroad - the \\"brain effect\\" - outweighs the \\"drain effect\\", i.e., the decrease in human capital due to actual emigration.Beine, M., Docquier, F., Rapoport, H. (2001). Brain drain and economic growth: theory and evidence. Journal of Development Economics, 64(1), pp. 275-289. They find evidence for this effect in further research on skilled migration from developing countries, wherein those combining low levels of schooling with low emigration rates experience a beneficial brain drain.Beine, M., Docquier, F., Rapoport, H. (2008). Brain drain and human capital formation in developing countries: Winners and losers. Economic Journal, 118(528), pp. 631-652. In a more recent study with David McKenzie, Albert Bollard and Melanie Morten, Rapoport finds that more educated people tend to remit more, conditional on remitting at all.Bollard, A. et al. (2011). Remittances and the brain drain revisited: The microdata show that more educated migrants remit more. World Bank Economic Review, 25(1), pp. 132-156. = Research on migration selectivity= Another topic in Rapoport's research has been migration selectivity, which conceives of migration as a (self-)selective process. For instance, in work with Ravi Kanbur, Rapoport has developed a model with selectivity by education, wherein human capital may develop either way depending on the endo- or exogeneity of education and where past migration increase the incentives for prospective migrants to emigrate, thereby helping the model to explain the evolution of spatial inequalities in the face of ongoing migration from poor to rich areas.Kanbur, R., Rapoport, H. (2005). Migration selectivity and the evolution of spatial inequality. Journal of Economic Geography, 5(1), pp. 43-57. These network effects are further explored in work with McKenzie in Mexico, where they are found to decrease the costs for future migrants and overall reduce inequality across communities with high levels of past migration.McKenzie, D., Rapoport, H. (2007). Network effects and the dynamics of migration and inequality: theory and evidence from Mexico. Journal of Development Economics, 84(1), pp. 1-24. Moreover, Rapoport and McKenzie also find evidence suggesting that the presence of migrant networks drives self-selection, with Mexican communities with strong migrant networks \\"sending\\" typically less educated members to the US compared with communities with weaker networks, in line with Borjas (1987) and Chiquiar and Hanson (2005).McKenzie, D., Rapoport, H. (2010). Self-selection patterns in Mexico-US migration: the role of migration networks. Review of Economics and Statistics, 92(4), pp. 811-821. = Other research= * In an analysis of the relationship between birthplace diversity and economic prosperity with Alberto Alesina and Johann Harnoss, Rapoport finds that birthplace diversity is unassociated with ethnic, linguistic or genetic diversity and that the diversity of immigrants is correlated with economic prosperity, especially for skilled, culturally proximate immigrants, suggesting complementarities between the skills of immigrants and natives.Alesina, A., Harnoss, J., Rapoport, H. (2016). Birthplace diversity and economic prosperity. Journal of Economic Growth, 21(2), pp. 101-138. * Investigating with Maurice Kugler whether international labor and capital flows are complements or substitutes, Rapoport argues that foreign direct investment and migration substitute each other at the global level, while highlighting that migrants provide information about future investment opportunities in their countries of origin.Kugler, M., Rapoport, H. (2007). International labor and capital flows: Complements or substitutes? Economics Letters, 94(2), pp. 155-162.

Following retirement from the IMS after 20 years of service in India, he returned to England and popularized a procedure for benign large prostates. This was known as the suprapubic prostatectomy, a transvesical prostatectomy or the Freyer operation, where the prostate is removed through an abdominal incision above the pubic bone but below the umbilicus and through the bladder, and it included using suprapubic drainage post-operatively. He entered the Bengal Medical Service as a surgeon in 1875 and served almost exclusively in civil employment in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh in the United Provinces of India. While based at Moradabad in 1888, he successfully operated on Muhammad Mushtaq Ali Khan, the Nawab of Rampur, crushing his bladder stone with a lithotrite. Freyer defended the renumeration he received from the Nawab, which had caused a controversy with the British establishment in India at the time. This and an eye injury caused while serving the civil surgeoncy of Benares contributed to Freyer taking early retirement and returning to England in 1896. In England he set up a private practice in Harley Street and was appointed a consulting surgeon in the surgery of the urinary organs at St Peter's Hospital for stone, London. He first performed the procedure of suprapubic prostatectomy in 1900, on a man who then survived 12 years. Although Freyer was not the first to introduce this operation, despite his claim otherwise causing the second significant controversy in his career, he is credited with popularising it. In 1920, he was elected the first president of the section of urology of the Royal Society of Medicine and in his presidential address, claimed to have performed 1,674 of these operations with a low mortality. The Department of Surgery, NUI Galway, hosts the annual Sir Peter Freyer Memorial Lecture and Surgical Symposium in his honour, and the James Hardiman Library at the NUI hold around 660 items of his memorabilia.  Early life and education  Peter Johnson Freyer, named after his paternal grandfather who was a chief officer in the Irish Coast Guard, was born in County Galway on 2 July 1851, the eldest child of landholder Samuel Freyer and his wife Celia Burke, who was a Roman Catholic. Freyer and his siblings however, were brought up as Protestant, a likely effect of the influence of the Irish Church Missionss (ICM) on the people in the area at that time. On 26 July of that year, he was baptised in Ballinakill's parish church. In 1855, his father, who was a tenant of the ICM supporter Sir Christopher Lighton, had in possession 17 acres of land at Moorneen and property and land in Knockbrack, both of which are located in Clifden. Twenty one years later, in 1876, when a list of those owning more than one acre was compiled, he was recorded as owning 210 acres. Freyer was educated at Erasmus Smith's College, Galway, and won a scholarship to attend Queen's College (now NUI Galway). He graduated in 1872 with a gold medal and a first class honors degree in Arts. Two years later, in 1874, he earned his MD and M.Ch. having won another gold medal. While a medical student he also spent some time as a resident pupil at Dr Steevens' Hospital in Dublin. Following a short time working in Paris, he returned to sit the competitive examination of the Indian Medical Service.Sir Peter Freyer's Papers. 1805-1987. NUI Galway. Reference code P57.  Indian Medical Service  419x419px =Admission to the Bengal Medical Service= Freyer came first in the competitive examination for a commission as a medical officer in the Bengal Medical Service, which later became part of the IMS. Entering the service as a surgeon on 30 September 1875, he became a civil surgeon in Azamgarh in April 1877. He started publishing his medical articles in The Indian Medical Gazette in 1878. Subsequently, he became a surgeon-major and surgeon lieutenant-colonel after 12 and 20 years' service respectively and retired from service on 3 May 1896. He served almost exclusively in civil employment in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh in the United Provinces of India, where he then held the civil surgeoncies successively of Moradabad, Bareilly, Allahabad, Mussoorie and Benares, and was also for a short time surgeon on the staff of the Lieutenant-Governor. =The controversy in India= During his time in India, he became reputable in cataract surgery and the operation of removing bladder stones, litholapaxy.Ellis, Harold. \\"The Birth of Modern Surgery\\" in A History of Surgery.

In return for his services, the Nawab gave Freyer a lakh (100,000) of rupees, equivalent to ¬£10,000, or ¬£598,900 at the time. He also treated General Azim Uddin Khan, the Nawab's chief administrator. This renumeration caused conflict between Freyer and his superiors in the Indian Government of the time, the British administrative authority in India. Freyer had been attending to the Nawab for over 16 months, providing regular treatment including the operation. The government of India raised objections to the receipt by a medical officer of so large a sum of money, and first ordered him to return the money to the Nawab, and later either to do so or to retire from the service. Arguing that there were no grounds in any regulation of the time, he refused to either return the fees or to resign. He was of the opinion that he had earned the money and in doing so had broken no role of the service, but had only done what he was entitled to do. In the end, his view of the case prevailed. The grant and receipt of this large fee, however, was what gave rise to the rules and regulations regarding acceptance of fees from Indian chiefs and gentlemen of high position, which although were later amended on fairly reasonable terms, proved unpopular with IMS officers who in turn put the blame on Freyer. =Later years in India= In 1894, Freyer represented the Indian government at the International Medical and Surgical Congress in Rome, where he presented his study on 598 cases of bladder stone removal by transurethral lithopaxy, using the same technique as Henry Jacob Bigelow. At the time, the mortality for open lithotomy was 12.5%, but Freyer demonstrated a 1.84% mortality. Following a promotion to the civil surgeoncy of Benares, he became surgeon to the Prince of Wales Hospital in Benares, later renamed the Shiv Prasad Gupta Hospital. His troubles with his superiors in India and an eye injury from an assault by a patient at the Benares asylum contributed to Freyer taking early retirement in 1896 and he returned to England. He had served in the IMS for more than 20 years.  Career in London Former buildings of St. Peter's Hospital In 1897, Freyer was appointed a consulting surgeon in the surgery of the urinary organs at St Peter's Hospital for stone, London, at a time when it was customary for young surgeons to tour French and English surgical centres. In August 1900, on route to Paris from New York, Ramon Guiteras made a stopover in London. Guiteras presented his suprapubic prostatectomy, which he modified from Eugene Fuller's version and then wrote to Fuller that \\"Dr. Freyer was very much pleased with the description of the operations, and said that he would try the method\\". The following year, in 1901 in the British Medical Journal, Freyer published his first four cases of suprapubic prostatectomy.Zorgniotti, Adrian W. Chapter 7. Suprapubic prostatectomy: An Anglo-Indian success story in Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy edited by Frank Hinman. Springer-Verlag, New York (1983), pp. 51- 54. . Crane, Genevieve and Bloom, David (1 August 2010) Ramon Guiteras: Founder of the American Urological Association, Surgeon, Sportsman and Statesman. The Journal of Urology. Vol. 184, No. 1, pp. 447-452. . He became an immediate success and was referred to by Lord Moynihan as a \\"Pee Free-er\\". Freyer performed before international audiences, running his own commentary and even speaking Hindi and French with some visiting surgeons.Morson, Clifford (1 August 1949) \\"Sir Peter Freyer and Sir John Thomson Walker\\". Editorial in the Postgraduate Medical Journal. pp. 353-358. His claims of introducing the surgery without credit to Fuller led Fuller to later state that \\"if he wishes to claim to be the original scratcher in connection with suprapubic prostatectomy, I certainly will not protest against that his only valid claim.\\" In 1905, Astley Paston Cooper Ashhurst, with an introductory letter from Richard Harte, stopped over in London to observe Freyer. He described Freyer in a letter to his brother, as a \\"brusque, blunt, rather aggressive man in manner...He seems to have rather a high opinion of himself and I certainly thought him a skilful operator\\". He continued in his letter that Freyer \\"showed me his large collection of prostates, over a hundred in all\\" and pointed out a number from notable men including one from Lord Kelvin. William Belfield, Arthur McGill and Eugene Fuller had all performed, for benign large prostates, the operation of removing the prostate through an incision made above the pubic bone but below the umbilicus and through the bladder. However it remained unpopular. Although Freyer was not the first to introduce this procedure, he is credited with popularising it, particularly following his report in 1920, presented at the RSM, on the low mortality of 1,674 cases of suprapubic prostatectomies, utilising suprapubic drainage post-operatively. He stated; > On December 1, 1900, I performed for the first time my operation of total > enucleation of the prostate, and in July, 1901, published in the British > Medical Journal, for the consideration of the profession at large, a lecture > delivered by me at the Medical Graduates' College, giving a full > description. of the operation, with details of four successful cases. I have > now completed 1,674 cases of the operation, details of 1,550 of which have > been recorded in the numerous papers published in the medical journals. I > believe I may say that this operation is now almost universally practised by > surgeons. Morson, however, later stated that Freyer performed a total of 1,337 prostatectomies.Morson, Clifford (1946). The Catheter and the Prostate. Corresppondance in British Medical Journal. P. 888. The number of articles and lectures Freyer gave, in addition to the publicity surrounding the controversies regarding his claims that he had introduced the operation, likely helped make the procedure widely known. In addition to the scandal in India caused by receiving fees from the Nawab, being accepted into the London's medical circles was not likely helped by being Irish. A. Clifford Morson had later noted that Freyer was just one of two surgeons appointed without a FRCS. He also recounted a story where a general practitioner referred to Freyer as a \\"quack\\". Morson, Clifford (30 December 1961) The Case of the Plastic Surgeons, Corresppondance in British Medical Journal. P. 1780. However, the operation had a lower mortality in Freyer‚Äôs hands compared to others, at a time before antibiotics and with only basic anaesthesia. Freyer‚Äôs skill lay in his speed. \\"Tre Treatment of Benign Enlargement of Prostate\\". British Association of Urological Surgeons Scientific held at the Royal College of Surgeons, Lincoln‚Äôs Inn Fields on 28 June 1946. The British Journal of Urology. Vol. 18, No. 3 (September 1946), pp. 105-121. John Thomson-Walker, first honorary secretary of the section of urology at the RSM, later described Freyer's surgery as \\"decided, purposive and rapid, and in some operations, especially that of litholapaxy, the manipulation was graceful\\". When Cuthbert Dukes became president of the urology section of the RSM in 1956, he disclosed that when he took up the appointment of pathologist at St Peters 26 years previously, he had come to be in possession of the medical notes and pathological specimen of the prostate removed from Freyer's first transvesical prostatectomy case of John Thomas in 1900. Thomas survived 12 years, and wrote to Freyer in 1912 \\"I must say I am perfectly right in my urinary organs and for which I shall never be able to thank you enough\\". The procedure was later superseded by the retropubic prostatectomy popularised by Terence Millin following his publication of the technique in 1945.Goddard, J. C. (January/February 2019).\\"The history of the prostate, part one: say what you see\\". Trends in Urology & Men‚Äôs Health, pp. 28-30. =Other roles= In 1902, he became examiner in surgery at the University of Durham and from 1904 to 1909 he was a member of the honorary medical staff of King Edward VII's Hospital for Officers. Thereafter he was appointed a consulting surgeon to the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital, Millbank, London. In 1904, he was awarded the Arnott Memorial Medal for original surgical work. First World War When the First World War began in 1914, Freyer rejoined for service as consulting surgeon to Queen Alexandria's military hospital, to be Indian hospitals in England, and to the eastern command in general. He received the CB on 1 January 1917 and the KCB six months later on 4 June 1917. Between 10 April 1918 and 10 April 1919, he held a temporary colonelcy in the Royal Army Medical Corps and upon resignation of post was promoted to an honorary full colonelcy on the retired list. In October 1919, he received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland. Later career After the war and with a greater recognition of urology as a specialty, Freyer at the age of 69, was elected the first president of the section of urology of the RSM in 1920, when the RSM's president was Sir Humphry Rolleston.Goddard, J. C. (September/October 2017) \\"Vis Unita Fortior united strength is stronger\\". Trends in Urology and Men's Health, pp. 31-33. His presidential address covered the achievements in urology over the previous 45 years and he hoped the section would result in a co-ordination of work in the field of urology. Freyer was succeeded the following year by Lord Horder, and the section continued with meetings and with its annual president‚Äôs address. Personal and family Freyer married Isabelle McVittie, daughter of Robert McVittie of Dublin, and they had one son, Dermot Johnston and one daughter, Kathleen Mary. In 1914, Isabelle died. Freyer was seen to be a \\"staunch Home Ruler\\", and the papers held at the NUI, Galway, provide evidence that he was friends with the Redmond brothers, William and John, who he operated on in March 1918. John subsequently died post-operatively. He was also friends with T P O'Connor, an Irish Nationalist member of Parliament.  Death and legacy Freyer died from a cerebral haemorrhage at 27 Harley St., London, on 9 September 1921, aged 70 years. He was buried beside his father in the Church of Ireland cemetery at Clifden, County Galway. A portrait of Freyer, painted by Alice Grant in 1919, hangs in the boardroom of St Peter's Hospital for Stone. Harold Ellis later recalled that Freyer's procedure remained popular for some time, recounting that in 1948, as a house surgeon, he assisted in many of these. Every year, the Sir Peter Freyer Memorial Lecture and Surgical Symposium, established in 1975 by professor O'Beirn, is hosted by the Department of Surgery, NUI Galway. Past lecturers have included Peter Froggatt in 1984, Thomas E. Starzl in 1985, Mutsuo Sugiura in 1986, Thomas J. Fogarty in 1987, Bernard Fisher (scientist) in 1988, Norman Stanley Williams in 1989, Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm in 1991, Patrick J. Kelly in 2001, Ara Darzi in 2002, Steven D. Wexner in 2004, Peter T. Scardino in 2006 and Patrick Gullane in 2009. A detailed account of Freyer is given in C. P. MacLoughlin's \\"From Sellerna to Harley Street\\". In 1980, the Department of Surgery at NUI Galway acquired Freyer's personal papers and memorabilia from his grandsons.

Ciss√© is an Nigerien-American biophysicist and Assistant Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He works on live cell super-resolution imaging and single molecule characterisation.  Early life and education  Ciss√© was born in Niamey, Niger. As a child he assumed that he would work in his father's law firm. He became interested in science through Hollywood films. In Niamey there were few opportunities to practise science as his school did not have a laboratory. He was keen to move to America to study, and completed high school two years early. He moved to the United States at the age of 17 to attend college. Ciss√© studied physics at the North Carolina Central University and graduated in 2004. During his undergraduate degree he was encouraged by Carl Wieman to apply for a fellowship, and spent a summer at Princeton University working in condensed matter physics. During this summer project he looked at jammed disordered packings, investigating how M&M;'s arrange in a small volume with Paul Chaikin. Ciss√© used various techniques to study jammed packings, including magnetic resonance imaging, but in the end used a much simpler approach - painting M&M;'s and analysing how many times they knocked into each other. The result was published in Science. He moved to Urbana for his graduate studies, and earned his PhD under the supervision of single molecule biophysicist Taekjip Ha at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 2009. After completing his doctorate, Ciss√© joined the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. He worked as a Pierre Gilles de Gennes Fellow in the joint labs of a physicist, Maxime Dahan, and a biologist, Xavier Darzacq. He also held a long- term fellowship with the European Molecular Biology Organization. In Paris, Ciss√© developed the single-cell microscopy technique time-correlated photoactivated localization microscopy (tcPALM), allowing for time resolved measurements in vitro. Ciss√© used transient-PALM to demonstrated that RNA polymerase II forms clusters that deconstruct after their work is done. Until Ciss√© made this discovery it was assumed that RNA polymerases were stable.  Research and career  Ciss√© moved back to America in 2013 and was appointed as a research specialist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He worked in the Janelia Research Campus. Ciss√© was appointed to the physics department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014. He uses super-resolution microscopy to understand how genes are turned on and off. Gene activation involves that transcription of DNA information into molecules of RNA. This transcription involves the enzyme RNA polymerase. Ciss√© used transient-PALM to demonstrate that the lifetime of a RNA polymerase cluster impacts how many RNA messages are sent from a gene. He showed that clusters of almost 100 RNA polymerases form for around 10 seconds close to the sites of activating genes. He has studied molecules of proteins in mouse embryonic stem cells. To do this, Ciss√© tagged the proteins with fluorescent emitters and then studied them with the microscope. His innovation demonstrated that the proteins involved in turning on genes join into a phase-separated droplet before they start to copy DNA into RNA. On September 8, 2020, the Vilcek Foundation announced that Ciss√© was the recipient of a 2021 Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Biomedical Science for using super-resolution biological imaging to directly visualize the dynamic nature of gene expression in living cells. = Awards and honours = * 2021 Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Biomedical Science * 2018 Science News SN10: Scientists to Watch. *2017 Biophysical Society Horiba Young Fluorescence Investigator Award * 2017 Pew Scholar in Biomedical Sciences * 2014 National Institutes of Health New Innovator Award  References  Living people People from Niamey Nigerien scientists American scientists Nigerien emigrants to the United States Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty North Carolina Central University alumni University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign alumni African-American scientists Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ibrahim Ciss√© (academic)"},{"id":"60545433","text":"Olaf Nowak (born 24 February 1998) is a Polish footballer who plays for Zag≈Çƒôbie Sosnowiec on loan from Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin.

The issue dated 29 July 1639 is the oldest issue still in existence of a newspaper printed in Italy. This newspaper was founded and edited by Michele Castelli, and it supported the pro-Spanish faction in the politic of the Republic of Genoa. This newspaper edited by Michele Castelli shall not be confused with another newspaper printed in Genoa from 1642 to 1684, always titled Genova, but founded by Alessandro Botticelli and tied to the pro-French faction, and sometimes known as Il Sincero. Scholars suppose that the first newspaper printed in Italy was edited in Florence in 1636 by Amador Massi and Lorenzo Landi, but no issue was discovered to confirm that conjecture, therefore the Genova newspaper, printed from 1639, shall be considered the oldest printed newspaper in Italy. History The government of the Republic of Genoa on 18 July 1639 authorized the printer Pier Giovanni Calenzano (1595‚Äî1668) and the editor-in-chief Michele Castelli to continue the publishing of a newspaper, which had at least a number issued on previous 15 July. The first two issues were titled Di Genova (in English: of Genoa), all later issues had simply Genova as title. The newspaper Genova was issued weekly on Fridays up to 1642 when it started to be issued on Saturdays. It was of four pages in a double format compared to a book (about 21.5x32 cm). It contained political and military news from Italy and abroad. The news about Genoa were limited to a few lines about the main public events, and no advertisement was present. The newspaper derived directly from hand-writing newssheets. The main sources of information were hand-writing newssheets received by ship from France, Spain, Lyon or by courier from Milan, as well as information obtained often illegally from the palaces of the government. The authorization to print was granted every three year: in 1639 and 1642 for free, while in 1645 against a high fee. That authorization, differently than in other states of Italy, was granted to the editor not to the printer. The printer, not always indicated, was Pier Giovanni Calenzano except for the issue of 17 February 1640 printed by Gio. Maria Farroni e Compagni. Michele Castelli, who edited the newspaper helped by his son Alessandro, was initially supported by the patricians Alessandro and Agostino Pallavicino (Doge of Genoa 1637-39) and he sided with the pro-Spanish faction in the politic of the Republic of Genoa. In 1642 another newspaper started to be printed in Genoa with the same name: it was edited by Alessandro Botticelli and tied to the pro-French faction. However, in the 1640s the pro-French faction became more and more strong and the Castellis were intimidated by their political opponents: on 17 February 1646 they left Genoa for one year and they left also the newspaper, which passed to Michele Oliva and his son Giovanni Battista. At the end of the same 1646 Giovanni Battista Oliva was murdered, and this determined the end of the publications. The last issue published was dated 15 December 1646. Starting from 1640 the newspaper Genova was illegally copied and printed in Florence by Amador Massi and Lorenzo Landi. Notwithstanding the remonstrances of Pier Giovanni Calenzano the plagiarism continued also in 1643.

He was imprisoned in the Tower of London for over a year owing to his alleged negligence. Life He was born in 1697 the son of Sir Robert Steuart, 1st Baronet of Allanbank near North Berwick (at that time simply called Berwick). His mother was Steuart's second wife, Jean Cockburn, daughter of Sir Archibald Cockburn baronet of Langton.http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I50181&tree;=CC Around 1715 he began trading as a wine merchant on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. In 1718 he was admitted as a burgess on the Edinburgh town council. In 1741 he was elected (as an opposition Whig) as MP for Edinburgh. He was one of the \\"Duke of Argyll's gang\\" voting against the Hanoverians in 1744. Spending more time in London due to his parliamentary duties, in 1743 he opened a wine shop at 11 Buckingham Street on The Strand. In 1744 he succeeded John Coutts as Lord Provost of Edinburgh.Lord Provosts of Edinburgh: Edinburgh City Chambers His most infamous reputation during his period as Lord Provost was the \\"surrender\\" (or welcoming depending on one's politics) of the city of Edinburgh to the Jacobite Army of Bonnie Prince Charlie on 17 September 1745. Stewart had received a royal warrant requiring him to raise a resistance force on 26 June and had raised a militia of around 300 men.http://ota.ox.ac.uk/text/4875.html However, this force was not put into operation, and the Jacobite force received little resistance. Supplementing the volunteers two brigades of Dragoons were dispatched to Coltbridge on the west of the city (known as the Coltbridge Canter, and often erroneously connected to the later Battle of Prestonpans). This force did not fight with the rebels, but were instead ordered to retreat, first to Leith, then right out of the city to Prestonpans (which is where the confusion of events arises). Despite Edinburgh's \\"official allegiance\\" to England at the time, it may be safely assumed that the majority of the politicians (and perhaps the general population) sympathised with the Jacobite cause. The Jacobite army were safely accommodated within Edinburgh. For this treasonous act Stewart was arrested and had to appear before the Privy Council in London on 7 December 1745 charged with \\"neglect of duty\\". Ironically the larger blame (if any were due) lay on the shoulders of the elderly General Joshua Guest, who had control of Edinburgh Castle and direct command of the dragoons.http://ota.ox.ac.uk/text/4875.html On 10 December he was ordered to be detained by the House of Commons and was accordingly detained in the Tower of London from 13 December. He was released from the Tower on 23 January 1747 following payment of ¬£15,000 bail (a truly huge sum in the 18th century).https://www.writersinspire.org/content/true-account-behaviour- conduct-archibald-stewart-esq-late-lord-provost-edinburgh-letter Returning to Edinburgh he was retrialed under Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton and found not guilty on 2 November 1747. This seemed to centre on the warrant requiring him to raise a militia but did not require him to use it in any stipulated manner. He afterwards returned to London to continue business on the Strand, living in the Mitcham district. He was succeeded as Lord Provost by George Drummond in 1746. It was Stewart not Drummond who remained Provost at the time of the Battle of Prestonpans, but (as stated above) the \\"capture\\" of Edinburgh is often muddled around the date of that battle.http://ourhistory.is.ed.ac.uk/index.php/The_University_and_the_%2745 In 1773 he (or possibly his son) is listed as a merchant living and working at Parliament Close on the Royal Mile.Williamsons Edinburgh Street Directory 1773 He died in Bath on 24 January 1780 aged 82.https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/stewart- archibald-1697-1780 Family In or before 1728 he married Grizel Gordon, daughter of John Gordon an Edinburgh wine merchant.

The Libyan Central Commission of Municipal Council Elections aimed for a total of elections in 68 municipalities in 2019. With difficulties in organising elections related to the 2019‚Äì20 Western Libya campaign, the elections were not completed in 2019; they continued in 2020. Background Of the 120 local councils that were created in 2013, the Libyan Central Commission of Municipal Council Elections (CCMCE), headed by Salem Bentahia , is responsible for elections in the 92 municipalities which successfully held elections with legally confirmed results during 2014‚Äì2015, and in Zawiya, Bani Walid and Dirj, in which the CCMCE held elections in 2018. 2019 =March 2019= Local elections were held in nine municipalities in southern and western Libya, including Zuwarah, on Saturday 30 March 2019, with an overall participation rate of 38 percent. =April 2019= Elections were held in 11 municipalities in April. On Saturday 20 April, local elections were held in Brak al-Shati, Edri al-Shati, al-Rahibat, Ubari, al-Garda al-Shati, al- Shwairif, and Zaltan. Ghassan Salam√©, head of United Nations Support Mission in Libya, complimented Libyans for holding these elections despite the 2019 Western Libya offensive. On Saturday 27 April, municipal elections were held in Sabha. Elections that had been planned for Sabratha and Surman on the same day were postponed by the Libyan National Army. Other towns in which municipal elections were held around these dates included Wadi Otbh, al-Ghuraifa, and Riqdalin. Sabha appeals Four appeals against the results of the Sabha election resulted in the election being declared invalid in a judicial ruling. In early November 2019, Judge Ibrahim Mahfouz in the Court of First Instance of Sabha overturned three of the appeals. A single judicial circuit can only consider three appeals on a case in the Libyan judicial system, whose top body is the Supreme Judicial Council of Libya, which remained unified during the Second Libyan Civil War. =May 2019= Voter registration by SMS was reopened by the CCMCE on 14 May for Misrata, Sabratha, al-Khums, Msallata, Jufra, Tarhuna, southern Zawiya, Kufra, Ghat, and eight municipalities in the Nafusa Mountains, including Asbi'a, Al-Haraba, Kikla, Kabaw. 2020 =August 2020= In mid-August 2020, municipal elections were held in Ghat, the first Libyan local elections for 2020. Municipal elections were planned to be held on 25 August 2020 in Traghan. A militia affiliated with the Libyan National Army (LNA) prevented the election from taking place. The elected Sabha council was restored to power in August 2020 following a court decision. The Government of National Accord (GNA) had earlier replaced the elected Sabha council by a temporary council. =September 2020= On 2 September 2020, plans for the CCMCE to hold municipal elections with local community support in 15 municipalities in the LNA-controlled (eastern) part of Libya, including Derna and Al Qubbah, were announced in Benghazi by CCMCE spokeperson Khaled Younis. Elections were held in Misrata on 3 September with CCMCE support. On 23 September, residents of Gharyan protested, calling for a municipal election to be held. =October 2020= Elections for the municipal councils of Al- Haraba, Jadu, Kabaw and Zawiya in western Libya will be held on 15 October.

He documented the civil war between Charlotte and her half brother James II, between 1440 and 1444, and the interventions by Hospitallers and Mamluks in the politics of the island.
