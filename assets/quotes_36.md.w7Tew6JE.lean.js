This means that the two genes (pseudoalleles) are nearly always inherited together. Since the two genes have related functions, they may appear to act as a single gene. In rare cases, the two linked pseudoalleles can be separated, or recombined. One hypothesis is that pseudoalleles are formed as a result of gene duplication events, and the duplicated genes can undergo gene evolution to develop new functions. Characteristic of pseudoalleles: # These are closely linked allele within which crossing over occur. # They affect the same character. Example: Red eye colour of Drosophila has different mutants like white and apricot. They affect pigmentation i.e., affect the same character. So, they are allelic.

The project team included Harvard University faculty members Robert Wood and Jennifer A. Lewis, along with researchers with backgrounds in mechanical engineering, 3D printing, microfluidics, and robotics. Octobot was described in the journal Nature in 2016.  Overview  Octobot is a 3D printed soft-bodied autonomous robot that shaped like a small octopus, and its soft body is made of 3D printed silicone gel. It uses hydrogen peroxide as its main power source and also contains a microfluidic logic circuit. Octobot is said to be able to move on its own without any aid by a battery or an electrical power source. The hydrogen peroxide flows around a network of 3D printed hollows (or freckles) within the body of the robot. Hydrogen peroxide moves over platinum pieces, which causes a chemical reaction. This chemical reaction causes a gas to form creating the main power source for the robot. This phenomenon produces a reaction that inflates and moves the arms, to propel the robot through water.  Design influences  The 3D printed silicon gel body of Octobot is designed to mimic the body of an octopus, and neither one has an internal skeleton. This material is flexible and sturdy, all while being able to move with ease. The Octobot is designed to mimic the movements of an octopus. The Octobot itself has also inspired new possibilities for technologies. Some scientists think that this new technology could pave the way for advancements in the medical field. The discussion of possibly changing the material that these soft-bodied autonomous robots are made from has also surfaced. The Octobot could be made from biodegradable material instead of 3D printed silicon gel leading to many advancements in environmental awareness. These soft-bodied autonomous robots also have the possibility to be used in search and rescue missions with their ability to be very flexible and possibly squeeze through spaces that humans or current robots may not.

It was based in Oakland, California. Hundreds of journalists used the platform to finance their writing and investigations. The organisers worked with newspaper publications to promote the projects, and to help the stories produced reach a wider audience. Beacon announced in an email on October 4, 2016 that they are no longer offering services for journalists or backers, and that on September 12, 2016 all active subscriptions were cancelled and no further contributions could be made. As of 2015, over US$1,000,000 was raised via 20,000 donors to fund journalism. The site differed from existing models of funding journalism with donations, such as National Public Radio and Kickstarter by focusing on the journalist, providing publishing support, vetting and audience participation in story development. Failure for individual writers is high, however popular news outlets, e.g. The Huffington Post and The Texas Tribune, have been more successful in raising funds. Example projects * The Huffington Post crowdfunded over $40,000 for a fellowship to allow a journalist to remain in Ferguson, Missouri to cover the protests in that city. * My Four Months as a Private Prison Guard - $75,000 salary funding for Shane Bauer, a hiker and journalist who was imprisoned in Iran for 26 months. *The Net Neutrality Battle - Techdirt raised nearly $70,000 to support its coverage of the net neutrality fight in Washington, D.C. * Climate Confidential - a team of six climate and environment reporters, raised over $46,000 to create a micro-publication devoted to climate issues. * The Texas Tribune obtained funding for a series of stories on how the shale boom is changing Texas. * Wolf OR7 - a grey wolf is scientifically studied making a journey from Oregon to California  Criticism  The partnership between Beacon and The Huffington Post was criticised for allowing a for-profit corporation seek and accept funding for donations that are usually reserved for non-profit entities.

The company's patented capacitive voltage reduction technology uses cascading capacitors to store power and convert voltages on chips, reducing the energy consumption of electronic devices. The company also has offices throughout the United States and in Europe. History Semitrex was founded in 2012 in Tulsa, Oklahoma by Michael H. Freeman, an Emmy Award- winning designer of mobile video technology that became the basis for the 802.11n wireless standard. The company's technology development efforts started with a search for improving the battery life of mobile phones, which led to power saving technology discoveries using capacitor-based circuits. The company relocated to Laguna Beach, CA, and in February 2015 exited stealth mode and announced its technology. By that time, the company had filed 46 patents for its capacitive voltage reduction technology, which it called Muxcapacitor. In March 2015, the company's integrated circuit (IC) was reportedly on its third generation, which the company announced was the last prototype before sample chips would be released to the market. In July 2015, Semitrex hired Washington DC lawfirm Hogan Lovells to lobby for energy efficiency issues. In February 2016, the company opened a design center in Irvine, California's \\"Technology Corridor\\", and an office in Milan, Italy, for better access to local engineering talent. The Milan office, also a design center, was reportedly focusing on mixed-signal analog chips, including digital power control designs. The Irvine design center became the company‚Äôs new headquarters. In June 2016, the company opened its London Integrated Design Center and formed a UK subsidiary, Semitrex Integrated Semiconductors, Limited. The UK expansion would reportedly allow the company to modify its Muxcapacitor technology to create power inverters to support the European Union's 2009 Renewable Energy Directive. In March 2017, the company rebranded as Helix Semiconductors, and Harold Blomquist was announced as the company's new CEO and President. Products/Technology =Muxcapacitor= The company's core semiconductor product is used for energy efficient power supplies. Its patented gate switch technology, called Muxcapacitor, is pre- regulation capacitive voltage reduction technology which uses cascading capacitors to more efficiently store power on a chip. Some capacitor banks are shut down when not in use, conserving power. The device also reduces the primary voltage through a transformer before the energy is processed for voltage and current adjustment and isolation. This reduces the size of the transformer and limits the need for secondary parts. Also, by using capacitive rather than inductive reductions, the need for magnets is eliminated, and very efficient high voltage conversions are achieved across a range of electrical loads. =Tronium PSSoC= Muxcapacitor technology is used on the company's Tronium brand of Power Supply System on a Chip (PSSoC), to manage power and reduce energy consumption for electronic devices. The Tronium PSSoC includes a dial-a-voltage feature which allows the chip to be programmed for a range of outputs from 1.8 to 48 volts, eliminating the need for additional country- specific power supplies. It also includes primary side regulation technology that eliminates the need for the opto-couplers which are traditionally required to maintain constant voltage and transfer electrical signals in the presence of high voltages. This reduces part count, allowing cost and size reductions of electrical equipment. The company sells a transformer-free Tronium variation called pwIoT (p-watt) designed for Internet of Things-type connected devices, which are often required to be compact to support a particular application. It takes AC line voltage and reduces it to the level of voltage the sensor requires. Products designed to work with minimal standby power requirements conserve energy and help solve the problem of vampire power drain, so-called because it drains while a machine or device is inactive. The pwIoT can be controlled remotely and wirelessly. =Inverter Supply System on a Chip= In June 2016, the company announced it was working in London on the reverse of the power supply process, with the Inverter Supply System on a Chip (ISSoC). While the core Tronium technology is designed to reduce energy consumption with high to low voltage power converters, the company began exploring the feasibility of designing an inverter to take low voltage DC, which typically comes from renewable energy sources, and boost it to high voltage AC. A so-called micro-inverter would help countries meet the EU's renewable energy application requirements. Awards and recognition In 2015, while still operating as Semitrex, the company received the 2015 Frost & Sullivan ‚ÄúNew Product Innovation for Powering the Internet of Things‚Äù Award. Their technology was also recognized at APEC 2016 (Applied Power Electronics Conference) as one of the ‚ÄúTop Ten Must-Have Innovations‚Äù. Patents The company holds 22 patents for its power supply technologies, including for its switched capacitor-based Muxcapacitor technique and quasi-resonant transformer-based power converter technology. Locations In addition to its Irvine headquarters and design center, the company has US offices in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Laguna Beach, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, Silicon Valley, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. International locations include a design center in Milan, Italy, and the London Integrated Design Center in London.

As a result of the reorganization of the Soviet mechanized corps, the 27th Mechanized Corps was disbanded before it saw combat.  History  = Formation = The corps was formed in March 1941 in Mary in the Central Asian Military District. The corps included the previously formed 9th Tank Division at Mary, and the new 53rd Tank Division at Kyzyl- Arvat, as well as the new 221st Motorized Division at Samarkand. The corps was commanded by Major General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov. = World War II = BT-7 of the type used by the corps On 22 June 1941, Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began. At the time the corps was equipped with 356 tanks. On 25 June the corps was alerted for movement to the west. On 27 June the first echelon of the 9th Tank Division moved west by rail, followed by the rest of the division. Moving through Tashkent and Orenburg, the division's first echelon reached Voronezh on 8 July. On 8 July, the Soviet General Staff decided to disband the mechanized corps and reorganize the tank divisions as a result of heavy tank losses in the first days of the war. The division's headquarters arrived at Voronezh on 10 July. The 27th Mechanized Corps was to become part of the 28th Army at Kirov. Unloading was to be carried out at the Fayansovaya railway station to the north of Kirov. The trains transporting the corps began to arrive at the station the next day, unloading only at night due to German air superiority. Many trains were delayed due to damage to the railway tracks, including one tank battalion that was stuck at Bryansk station for three days. By 15 July, the concentration of the 9th Tank Division had been completed with 208 tanks (mostly T-26s and BT-7s). At the same time the 9th Tank Division had become the 104th Tank Division, the 53rd Tank Division the 105th Tank Division, and the 221st Motorized Division the 106th Tank Division. The corps was disbanded on 15 July, and the 106th Tank Division became the 106th Motorized Division on 19 July.

Halliday began producing her television show the Princess Halliday Show in collaboration with Multichoice Africa to be syndicated on M-Net via the DSTV network. The show has Halliday and her team travel across the world to showcase world leaders, global players, entrepreneurs, movie stars and ordinary people doing extraordinary things. In 2012, Halliday after a visit to the Niger Delta area and taking note of the lack of structure in the water network, mobilized the Empower Africa Initiative in conjunction with the Niger Delta Development Commission of Nigeria to carry out the Reticulation of pipes in the Niger delta area, creating pipe borne water for several Niger delta communities. Halliday is the first young Nigerian to properly strive to have a degree in Leadership that transcribes what it means to lead authentically. Princess Halliday desires to use her degree and expertise to change negative stereotypes of Africans where young women are not often believed to be leaders.http://empowerafricainitiative.com/princess- halliday-breaks-leadership-stereotypes/ =2014 till date= In 2014, Halliday earned a leadership training from Harvard University known as \\"Communicating with Influence-The Art of Persuasion\\". She has a degree in Leadership from Woodbury University. Determined to revolutionize the understanding of leadership as Africa knows it, Halliday frequently strengthens the need for mindsets to be empowered. Halliday hosted the 2014 Miss Commonwealth International Pageant in the UK. She also served Rivers State as a special media and image consultant to wife of the governor of Rivers State at the time, Dame Judith Amaechi. Halliday along with women from Rivers State visited Morocco for the World Leaders Summit/Crans Montana Female Leadership Forum in Rabat, where she met the President of Malta, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, the youngest female to assume the office of the President, and her Chief of Staff John Camilleri. In 2015, the Princess Halliday show was renewed for another season, and she played host to a number of notable international guests including, American Christian contemporary singer Don Moen, Jamaican singer Chevelle Franklyn, former Nigerian Presidential candidate, Professor Pat Utomi, emmy nominated actress Amy Gibson, Hollywood actor from the movie \\"the perfect match\\" Rob Riley and a former Rivers State gubernatorial candidate Dakuku Peterside and many others.

Princess Halliday spoke and addressed leaders at the Mackerel Business and Leadership conference in Virginia Commonwealth University on \\"How Authenticity Affects Leaders in Africa\\" Princess who with very substantial experience on Leadership & Strategy, shared on ‚ÄúHow Authenticity Affect Business Leaders in Africa‚Äú believing it is time for business leaders to begin to change their mindset from the conventional development mindset to a revolutionary and investment mindset revealing that there is increasing hope for Africa. =World Bank Meeting Annual 2017= \\"I am aware that people can hardly correlate a beautiful lady to leadership especially in our continent where young women are not believed to be carriers of great initiative. This has been a great challenge to me and so daily I endeavor to do the extraordinary. I strive to educate and empower men and women to identify their leadership parity and have young girls know that they have the capacity to be leaders and yes Beauty Equates to Leadership. I am a leader with my own style. Am I changing the dynamics of leadership? Yes I am and this is so important to me. We have had enough of the conventional stalled leadership that has existed for so long and very rarely worked. It is time for a revolution. You can be young, pretty, intelligent, do things the right way and be an Authentic Leader,\\" she said. She said, \\"Oftentimes, leaders talk about growth and giving opportunity to the young generation but in reality very few leaders want growth. Power gets intoxicating and so it becomes hard for them to let go. But the truth is great leaders extend the circle of influence so the most junior person feels like they belong. But one great challenge for Africa‚Äì one that has stalled her leadership ‚Äì is how to convince 1.2 billion people to put aside competing interests, sideline different religions, leaderless uprising, ethnicity, political persuasions, and build a United Nation with Authentic leaders to truly bring about significant change.\\" =Leadership style= As a guest lecturer at California State University, Northridge, it has been noted that Princess Halliday strives for women in Africa to get a sit at the table with a mission to develop ethical leaders with an ability to think critically and act effectively. She has constantly liaised with the women in position of authority in Africa, accentuating the need for embracing Empowered parity. Personal life Halliday currently lives in West Hollywood, California, in the United States, where, as of 2016, episodes of her television show were being taped. When asked about marriage, the Leadership Newspaper quotes her as saying ‚ÄúI will be married to a man with great wisdom and one who understands the turbulence of my call on earth. His footstep is still being orchestrated!‚Äù Awards and recognition In recognition of her work in diverse fields, Halliday has received a number of laurels, including being recognized by the International Commonwealth platform in London, and she was given the award for the Youngest Executive Producer/TV Talk show Host in History. Princess Halliday‚Äôs passion for showcasing positivity and her uncanny ability to lead authentically with emotional intelligence and communicate with empathy has solidified her as one of the young female authentic voice in the world.

The names Bordland,Fulton, page 157 Boreland,Robertson, page 341 Borland, Laigh Borland, Low Borland and Nether Borland have all been applied to the site of the laird's house. History =The Mansion House, Castle, Farm and Estate= A view of Dunlop or Borland Hill showing the 'Cuckoo Slide'. The summit was the site of the castle built by Godfrey de Ross. In 1848 the Scottish Journal records that a number of years ago the foundation of a ruin of considerable extent was removed by the late proprietor.Arch Ayr Wigton, Pages 26 - 27 In 1853 Mr. Dobie recorded that There can still be traced the meiths (boundary line) of a building of considerable extent on the top of the Hill of Borland.Arch Ayr Wigton, Page 27 Mr. G. Howie, of Dunlop in 1856, stated that he remembered seeing a small portion of what was said to be one of the walls about 70 or 80 years ago. It was a sort of bank, quite crumbled down and overgrown with grass. Since then, the ruins of a building of considerable extent have been removed and the ground cultivated.Name Book On the southern side of the hill there are the remains of a wide ditch or fosse, locally known as the 'Cuckoo slide.'Hutchison, Pages 7 - 8. PatersonPaterson in 1866 states that the foundation of a ruin was removed some years ago by a late proprietor. A local tradition is that the monks of Kilwinning Abbey had a hospice for their brethren at Borland where medicinal herbs were grown in a formal garden. It is recorded that a two merk land at Dunlop was appropriated to the church and the remainder used by the monks.Arch Ayr Wigton, page 28 Borland may have been similar to Monkredding near Kilwinning that was also once held by the Tironensian monks of Kilwinning Abbey and was the 'Monk's Garden', effectively a rest home for the brothers.Ness, Page 65 Borland A substantial and ornately carved table style gravestone in the Dunlop graveyard records a William Anderson who died aged 70 on 3 December 179(?)6 and his wife who died in 1784. The memorial was erected by his son Robert Anderson of Borland. This stone is now leaning against the 'Picture House' building.

One of their first acts was to rebuild the old mansion house.Dobie, page 98 These reports do not agree on when Borland was rebuilt however the early 19th century seems likely. The walled garden was probably built in the 19th century and stones from the old castle may have been used in its construction. Borland, later Nether or Laigh Borland, was described in the OS 'Name Book' of 1855-57 as being composed of \\"Two small farm houses & steadings with gardens etc. attached, in a sheltered situation on the side of Glazert Burn about ¬Ω mile south-west of Dunlop, the property of Andrew Brown Esq. of Hill and occupied by Mr. James Templeton and Mr. Robert Frew.\\"Scotland's Places - OS Name Books Borland House prior to 1916 Walled gardens are not generally associated with farms and the presence of one at Borland suggests that the site at one time had a higher status than that of a tenanted farm. The walled garden is square, probably originally 18th century in date with its south, east and west walls rebuilt circa 1916 and greatly reduced in height and also in length. They are mainly built from random rubble with flat sandstone copings and are much thinner than the north wall. The prominent cylindrical gate piers with conical caps to the south also date from 1916 and are placed slightly back from the line of the wall.British Listed Buildings - Over Borland An old door on the east side has been blocked off. A culvert or cundy runs beneath the garden and exists as a stream on the north side that drains into the Glazert Water. The north wall was not altered in 1916. A sundial is indicated as standing in the centre of the garden and is visible in an old black and white photograph.Ayrshire 012.04 (includes: Dunlop) Publication date: 1910. Revised: 1909 Laigh Borland was demolished in the mid 20th century and it is recorded that a 16th or 17th century datestone with the initials of the Brown family once existed above the entrance door of the attached building that was latterly a kitchen. Its relative inaccessibility due to the ford had been partly overcome by a hardcore access from Over Borland however it had fallen into disrepair and the council required its demolition on safety grounds as a public access still existed via North Borland with a pedestrian crossing at the ford for footpath walkers, the concrete bases used as handrails supports are still present. The workers cottages, one occupied by Mrs Watt, were thatched up until demolition and an associated small ruined building, probably a pigsty, still exists partly built into the hillside. The family grave of the Watt family records that Martha Watt n√©e Stevenson died in 1916 at Laigh Borland at the age of 81. The cottages were demolished shortly after this date and the changes to the walled garden enacted at the same time. In 1913 a wooden footbridge crossed the Glazert Water and stepping stones were present. Over Borland Robert Wilson of Over Borland was married to Agnes Gemmill who died in November 1636. In her Will she bequeathed legacies to her grandsons John Dunlop and William Gemmill.Histories of Scottish Families John Dunlop of Over Borland married Elizabeth Walkinshaw and in 1650 was valued at 100 Scots.Paterson, page 234 Gravestone of the Watts of Borland and Laigh Borland Over Borland Farm. A gravestone in Dunlop's churchyard records the deaths of John Dunlop of Over Borland, his wife Jean Gilmour and their children, namely John who died aged 4 in 1778, Margaret who died aged 5 months in 1784, William who died aged 3 in 1792, John who died aged 12 in 1792 and Jane who died aged 27 in 1804. Jean Gilmour died in 1827. Over Borland is a Category 'C' Listed farm house located at the end of a lane that branches off from the lane to Dunlop near the Millennium Woodlands (55.7099, -4.5491) (NS239940, 6492150). The building carries a 1770 datestone inscribed 'RN JS 1770' and another stone next to the doorway inscribed 'JMN MRS 1912'. Over Borland in 1855-1857 is recorded as \\"A small farm house & steading with garden & land attached about half a mile south-west of Dunlop, belonging to Andrew Brown Esq. and occupied by Mrs. Watt.\\" Together with 'Hill' aka 'Over Hill' is one of the oldest surviving 2-storey farmhouses in Dunlop parish. A possible date for the removal of the old castle masonry would be 1781 + or - 5 years which effectively embraces the year 1770, the date of the probable rebuilding of Over Borland as stated on the 'RN JS 1770' date stone. It has been stated that the enlargement of Over Borland was carried out to provide a replacement for Borland aka Laigh Borland and this property was later let out to tenants. A family gravestone in Dunlop parish church graveyard records a John Watt, farmer in Boreland (sic) whose wife was Ann Craig. This couple had offspring Catherine and Matthew who died young and a son who inherited, David, living to 79 years of age and dying in 1881. David's wife was Martha Stevenson who died in 1916 at Leigh (sic) Borland. North Borland Jane Dunlop married Thomas Reid of Balgray near Irvine and inherited the North Borland portion of the Lands of Borland, their son John Dunlop Reid then inherited North Borland. Thomas and Jane Reid built a fine new house at North Borland. Other Borland properties Hill or Over-Hill of Dunlop was once part of the Lands of Borland, passing to the Brown family through marriage, notably the burial stone of John Dunlop of Overhill and Barbara Gilmour his wife is located in Dunlop churchyard with the date 1732. John Dunlop's grandson, Andrew Brown, is also recorded, dated 1794. John Dunlop and Barbara Gilmour had one child, Mary, who married Allan Brown of Gabroch-hill and several generations and inter-marriages later Andrew Brown of Craighead married the aforementioned Mary Dunlop of Borland and the couple later inherited Hill or Overhill.Dobie, page 99 Borlandhills and several other properties were once part of the Lands of Borland. =The Lairds= The native chiefs, although displaced from Boarland Hill (sic) do not appear to have been exiled, instead they established themselves as the Dunlops of that Ilk at what is now Dunlop House on the Clerkland Burn.Dobie, Page 98 A tradition states that the De Ross first held Borland or Dunlop Hill (NS 4019 4940) as their seatPaterson, Page 226 and a well-fortified stone built structure existed there, later their seat was moved to Corsehill in Stewarton. A Celtic hillfort may have existed here, as suggested by the etymology of the placename.Arch Ayr Wigton, Page 26 Corsehill Castle became their primary residence after Godfrey de Ross was granted the Lands of Stewarton. The De Ross family were vassalsMillar, Page 71 to the De Morvilles, Overlords of Cunninghame. The De Morvilles backed John Balliol's claim to the crown and forfeited their lands to the Boyds, and in 1570 the lands were held by the Cassilis family. Timothy Pont records that Over and Nether Borland were held by the Kennedys, Earls of Cassilis in the early 17th century, the lands having passed to them from Godfrey de Ross who \\"..hauing his refidence heir enioyed ample possefions abrode in ye countrey and ves for ye tyme Shriffe of Aire.\\" Alexander Cunninghame of Aiket married the sister of the Earl of Cassilis and this may explain how Borland passed into Cunninghame of Aiket hands. The gravestone of John Dunlop of Over Hill, Barbara Gilmour his wife and Andrew Brown of Over Hill Memorial to John Dunlop, Jean Gilmour and their family. The name 'Borland' is popularly thought to derive from the hunting of boar in the area however another authority points out that \\"Bordlands signifie the desmenes which lords keep in their hands for the maintenance of their board or table.\\" The De Ross family were vassals of Richard de Morville.Dobie, page 97 Prior to 1597 the 6 Merk land of the nearby estate of Hapland was part of the Lands of Dunlop and David Dunlop, fourth of Hapland, exchanged or excambied Hapland for the Lands of Borland Bayne, page143 1600 accordingly to Robertson. Although a merk land was a measure of rental value it can be estimated that 6 merks would be between 6 and 12 acres.Dictionary of the Scots Language 1660 is another suggested date for when Patrick Cuninghame exchanged his lands of Borland for those of nearby Hapland. John Dunlop, fourth of Borland, married a Montgomerie of High Cross near Stewarton and had three children, one of whom died young. The eldest son, John, inherited and his brother is designated James of Loanhead.Paterson, page 235 John Dunlop, fifth of Borland, married Mary Clark of Shitterflat (sic) who was the daughter of William Clerk, portioner of that property and his spouse Margaret Simpson. The couple had four sons and two daughters with the eldest son, John, inheriting. The Dunlops of Borland continued in possession until the male line ended sometime around 1823 with two daughters, Mary and Jane, the parents being John Dunlop (sixth of Borland) and Jean, daughter of John Gilmour of Tailend in situated in the east of Dunlop parish. They had a large family however only Mary and Jane survived to adulthood. Mary Dunlop married Andrew Brown of Craighead, the eldest son of John Brown of Hill and received as her inheritance the portion of Borland that contained the old mansion house, \\"..romantically situated by the Glazert Water..\\". One of their first acts was to rebuild the old mansion house. The couple had two sons and six daughters with the eldest son, John Brown, inherited Borland and is recorded as 'John Brown of Hill, Craighead and Borland' who married Marion Duncan of Brockwellmuir and this couple had three sons and two daughters, the eldest son being John Brown. As stated, Jane Dunlop married Thomas Reid of Balgray near Irvine and inherited the North Borland portion of the Lands of Borland, their son John Dunlop Reid then inherited North Borland. Thomas and Jane Reid built a fine new house at North Borland whilst Andrew and Mary Brown inherited \\"the original mansion, lately rebuilt, on the banks of the Glazert, in a remarkable pleasant situation..\\" The Lands of Borland were apparently held for many years by what might be best described as 'Bonnet Lairds', named from petty landowners who wore a hat or bonnet like the humble working labourers.Merriam-Webster Dictionary Retrieved : 2013-07-13 It seems that Over Borland was the farm or 'mains' associated with the 'Laird's' house and this is born out by the fact that Borland never had all the required buildings associated with a working farm and was embellished with a walled garden usually associated with mansion houses. =The 1586 Murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton= Site of the murder of Hugh, 4th Earl of Eglinton On 4 November 1570, William and Alexander Cunninghame of Aiket were brought to trial for ambushing and together with others, killing John Mure of Caldwell on the Lands of Borland,MacIntosh, pages 301-302 however they were acquitted. An old tradition relates that 'shortly' after the murder of John Mure, the young Dunlop Laird of Hapland was persuaded against his mother's wishes to join the Cunninghames of Aiket in a raid on one of their neighbours that they were feuding with. The laird's mother had a dream that predicted her son's death and it indeed came to pass that he fell, mortally wounded, on the banks of the Annick Water, near Stewarton and his horse foaming and spent returned riderless to Hapland, having escaped from the field of battle where his master had died.Ballads Founded on Ayrshire Traditions This old tradition seems to relate to the Murder of Hugh Montgomerie, 4th Earl of Eglinton at the Annick Ford in Stewarton in 1586 that occurred as a consequence of the long running feud between the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglinton and the Cunninghames, Earls of Glencairn, families who were competing for power and influence locally and nationally. The significant repercussions of this act were felt throughout the county of Ayrshire and beyond. In the list of the conspirators there is a Gilbert Dunlop, however he is recorded as a servant of 'Patrick of Baidland'. Paterson records that a Gilbert Dunlop existed in 1498 so it was a name used by the family. Patrick Cunninghame of Bordland (sic) was certainly present at the ambush. It is interesting that as detailed above Patrick Cunninghame shortly after excambied or exchanged his 'Lands of Borland' for those of David Dunlop's 'Lands of Hapland'. The reasons for this exchange could relate in some way to the aforementioned incident and its many repercussions. In 1612 Patrick Cunninghame however sold these lands to Gabriel Porterfield, son of Alexander Porterfield of that Ilk.Dobie, page 205 Cartographic evidence The OS maps indicate that the main entrance to Laigh Borland was via the Sandy Ford lane that ran past North Borland and crossed the Glazert water. A minor access branched off from the lane to Over Borland and ran down the steep lower slope of Borland Hill to enter close to the walled garden's south-eastern corner. A footpath with a stile ran down from Over Borland to Laigh Borland.Ayr Sheet XII.4 (Dunlop) Survey date: 1856 Publication date: 1858 In 1856 Laigh Borland was recorded as 'Borland' whilst Over Borland did carry the name is still has today. The walled garden is shown with internal beds equally divided into four by paths with an entrance off Sandy Ford Lane. A small structure stands at the front entrance of the walled garden. A well is shown close to the old worker's cottages and another lies off the end of a well made path that extends towards the Glazert behind Borland House. A lane or more likely a cart track runs from Borland and eventually joins the lane to Over Borland. The land behind Borland is wooded with a rectangular open area. The Sandy Ford appears to have stepping stones and provides the only vehicular access to Borland House. The 1916 walled garden In 1895 a small pond is located behind the north wall of the walled garden that no longer has a formal laid out interior. A footbridge stands at the ford and a second path links what is now marked as Laigh Borland with the lane out towards Dunlop via the Straitbow Bridge. Two small buildings stand against the walled garden, south and west walls.Ayrshire 012.04 (includes: Dunlop) Publication date: 1897. Revised: 1895 The 1909 OS map shows a few changes in that the pond is not marked, only a single track runs up towards the Dunlop road via the Straitbow Bridge and the farm cottages have fenced or walled enclosures behind them. A sundial is indicated as standing in the centre of the garden. By 1957 Laigh Borland is not named separately and a road access has been constructed from Over Borland via the Middle Rig field and the worker's cottages have been demolished, no doubt supplying hard core for the new access. The cottages were present in 1925.Sheet 60 - Glasgow Publication date:1957 =Place names= Sandy Ford Lane and the Glazert Water. The name Boarland (sic) could refer to the presence of wild boar,Dobie, Page 97 however a 'Boor' also meant a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants.Bayne, Pages 10 - 16. Another interpretation is that Borland or Bordland meant the land that was granted to the feudal superior, Godfrey de Ross, specifically to be used to furnish food for his castle or dwelling.Mackenzie, Page 29.McMichael, Page 85 The name 'Borland' occurs in the names of the properties of Borlandhill, Over Borland, North Borland and Laigh Borland. Middle Rig runs below the Fox Covert wood and Corsbie Craigs lies to the south with Black Craigs to the north-west with a White Craigs just across the Glazert Water. The name 'Glazert' may come from the Gaelic glas that means grey or green and dur meaning water.McNaught, page 43 Corsbie or Crosbie refers to a 'cross' with the Scandinavian suffix '-by' meaning a settlement.Johnston, page 90 A 'Rig' is a long narrow ridge and a 'Fox Covert' was usually woodland reserved for fox breeding, feeding, etc. in relation to fox hunting. A 'craig' is a cliff. The Sandy Ford derives its name from the coarse sand that accumulates there to this day. Barbara Gilmour Andrew Brown of Over Hill aka 'The Hill' who died in 1791 was the grandson of John Dunlop of Over Hill, husband of Barbara Gilmour. As previously mentioned, Mary Dunlop, daughter of John Dunlop of Borland and Jean Gilmour of Tailend, had half of Borland (Borland House) with her husband Andrew Brown and died at the Hill aka Over Hill in Dunlop parish, the property of her mother's brother- in-law, in 1839.Paterson, James (1866). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V.3. Cuninghame, Part E. Pub. Edinburgh. P.235. Barbara Gilmour or Dunlop was a significant figure in 17th century Ayrshire having introduced a method of cheese making which became common throughout Ayrshire and beyond, providing employment and extra income for farmers and others. Micro- history A Cunninghame of Borland was involved in a raid against Drumlanrig in 1650. in 1618 Gabriel Porterfield married Mariot Crawfurd and inherited the lands of Gills, Lothrihill, the Templeland and Maynes (Mains) of Hapland, including the mansion house and also acquired Dunlop Hill.Dobie, Page 205 Local tradition has it that a Ley Tunnel runs from the site of Laigh Borland House to Aiket Castle. A Mr 'Pop' McGaw was one of the last tenants of Laigh Borland. An artificial fox den built with stones existed in the fox covert wood to encourage foxes to breed for the purposes of the hunt. One of the group of four who removed the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey in 1950 was descended from the Watt family of Laigh Borland.

It was developed by Plastic Studios, published by Sony Interactive Entertainment and released on August 16, 2016, for the PlayStation 4. The game received mostly positive critical reviews, praising its art style and originality, but criticizing the gameplay as shallow.  Gameplay  Gameplay showing the princess navigating a narrow beam The player controls an unnamed princess and ballet dancer as she makes her way through surreal, dreamlike environments. She must complete platforming challenges and has the ability to repel enemies with her dancing. The game uses an \\"Edge Guard\\" to prevent the player from falling off certain platforms. This was because the developer believed that being able to fall off detracted from the game experience by forcing players to pay closer attention to the character's legs than to the world. There are some places where the princess can fall and die, but she will respawn nearby.  Plot  The game takes place inside the mind of a pregnant woman who is revisiting her childhood home and memories. In the woman's mind world, the main character is a Princess who is following the orders of her mother, the Queen, to vanquish a monster that is destroying the world. According to the game's creative director, \\"everything in the game is a big metaphor\\", and there are scenes in the game that show real life and not the game's world.  Development  The creative director of Bound, Michal Staniszewski, said that the game took three and a half years to develop. The game was designed to be best played in a single sitting, and he suggested that investigating too much of the game before playing it would cause the experience to be spoiled, comparing it to the games Journey and Firewatch. Inspiration for the game's idea also came from the game Ico. The game was directed at a target audience of older gamers who have been playing games \\"their whole life\\" and are tired of solving puzzles, instead simply wanting an audiovisual experience without frustrating or repetitive gameplay. However, the developers still wanted to include some challenge to the game, so that it was not simply a walking simulator. It was meant to be a short experience as the creative director noted that, like other adults, he lacked the time to play larger, 100-hour games such as The Witcher 3. The game's aesthetics were largely inspired by modern art and its development from the beginning of the 20th century. The game developer Tale of Tales was also cited as an influence in the design of the game, as well as the digital art of the demoscene. The idea of a dancing main character was not added from the beginning of development. Rather, after one and a half years in development, the developers were disappointed with how similar to a typical game character her movements looked, and were inspired by a video of a modern jazz dance to change their movements to those of a dancer. Motion capture was used on the dancer Maria Udod, who was chosen due to her experience both in ballet and contemporary dance, in order to record her movements for use by the protagonist. Her choreographer was Micha≈Ç Adam G√≥ral. Every animation of the character was changed to a dance move. The game's developers were forced to sacrifice visual effects for performance, because they did not want the game to run with motion blur or framerate drops, due to the hardware limitations of the PlayStation 4. The game runs at a stable 60 frames per second (FPS), and Staniszewski believes that games that run at lower FPS than 60 are not the \\"proper way that games should look on TVs\\". On October 13, 2016, Plastic released a patch that enabled PlayStation VR compatibility. Later, on November 10, 2016, another patch was published, enabling PlayStation 4 Pro support, including 4K resolution and increased pixel density in VR mode.  Reception  Bound received mixed to positive reviews, with an aggregate score of 71/100 on Metacritic. Chris Carter of Destructoid rated the game 60/100, saying that its graphics are \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"stunning\\", but calling the movement \\"stiff\\" and combat too easy, believing the game leans \\"too hard\\" on the platforming aspect. Matt Peckham of Time rated it 50/100, saying that while the game is fun to watch, it is boring to play because it is so easy to navigate the world. Jim Sterling of The Jimquisition gave it the same score, saying that, while beautiful, playing it is a \\"messy, obstructive hassle\\" with poor controls and camera movement, as it is unable to commit to either being a walking simulator or a fully realized puzzle platformer and is instead a hybrid of both. Justin Clark of GameSpot gave the game a 70/100, saying that while its gameplay is \\"rudimentary\\", this is made up for by the graphical details of the game, calling each stage a \\"cubist marvel\\" and the idea of a dancing main character deserving of praise and saying that it \\"displays immense amounts of contemplation and ambition in every aspect except gameplay\\". He claims that \\"[to] decry it for its overly simplistic mechanics is to ultimately miss the forest for the trees\\", and that \\"Bound is digital art installation\\" whose full impact is only evident in its final moments. The game was selected to appear in IndieCade 2016.

According to a 2017 report, there are approximately 5,000 Haitian-born people living in Mexico. History An amount of Haitians moved to Mexico during the presidency of Fran√ßois Duvalier in the 1970s, and relocated to Mexico City and other cities. After the 2010 Haitian earthquake, 324 Haitians relocated to Mexico via a Mexican naval ship from January 12 to late April 2010. According to the National Migration Institute (INM), each Haitian would be granted a \\"humanitarian visa\\", allowing them to work and study in Mexico, use public services, and travel to and from the country. The Haitians settled primarily in Mexico City, Pachuca, and Monterrey. Most of the Haitians who moved after the earthquake had relatives who were already living in Mexico. Haitians, as well as other migrants, took up residence in Tijuana, Baja California and Mexicali, Baja California and several other Mexican cities seeking entry to the United States. According to the top immigration official in the state of Baja California, in a span of a few weeks in May and June 2016, stated that a large amount of the migrants arriving in Tijuana came from Haiti, but claim they are from African countries with which Mexico lacks diplomatic relations, in order to avoid being deported by Mexican authorities. In September 2016, United States ended the entry of Haitian migrants as refugees. Many trapped Haitian migrants reluctantly stayed in Mexico settling either in Tijuana or Mexicali rather than attempt to cross into the United States or return to Haiti. They were issued temporary resident cards and the CURP tax identification numbers. The Haitian community has settled in the Divina Providencia neighborhood of the city. Demographics There are 940 Haitian-born people living in Mexico, as of 2010, according to the OCED.

In 1933, Robbins lectured The Booklovers' Circle on \\"Censorship of Crime\\", arguing that the detective novel was here to stay, it being more respectable now than it had been in his youth to be interested in crime, but warned that one must not confuse crime with sin and that the detective novel must not teach people how to commit crime.\\"The Booklovers' Circle\\", The Bookman, April 1933, Vol. 84, No. 499, p. 87. Robbins' novels were mostly published by Ernest Benn in London and Appleton in New York. They were praised for their intricacy and cleverness but criticised for their length. In 2016, it was announced that Canelo, a digital-only publisher, would begin republishing the Clay Harrison series.Canelo searches for descendants of forgotten crime author. Natasha Onwuemezi, The Bookseller, 22 August 2016. Retrieved 26 August 2016. Robbins also wrote two novels featuring Captain George Champion Staveley, an amateur detective who is unable to leave his room due to war injuries but manages to solve cases with the help of his wife and friends in his village. In the first Staveley novel, Six sign-post murder, the death of a play-girl leads to a sinister crime lord and a drug-smuggling rugby player.\\"Crime for the connoisseur\\", Maurice Richardson, The Observer, 26 February 1939, p. 7. Among Robbins' other works is The Devil's beacon, a novel about a Mr. Vasco, who is an anti-smoking campaigner and forms the League Against Tobacco which enjoys success due to the support of the owner of the fiction newspaper the Daily Flight before fizzling out.\\"New fiction\\", The Church Times, 22 September 1933, p. 333.

The corps was first formed in 1934 in the Leningrad Military District and was converted into the 10th Tank Corps in 1938. The corps was reformed in the summer of 1940 in the Moscow Military District and fought in the Battle of Smolensk, after which its headquarters became part of Group Yartsevo's headquarters. The corps was formed a third time in August and September 1943. The third formation fought in the Dnieper‚ÄìCarpathian Offensive, Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive, Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, Battle of Debrecen, Budapest Offensive, Bratislava‚ÄìBrno Offensive, Prague Offensive, and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Postwar, the corps' third formation became a division and was disbanded in 1957.  History  = First Formation = The corps (Military Unit Number 4862) was formed in June 1934 as part of the Leningrad Military District, under the command of Komdiv Mikhail Bakshi. The corps consisted of the 31st Mechanized Brigade and the 33rd Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade, left behind after the transfer of the 11th Mechanized Corps to the Transbaikal Military District, and the new 19th Mechanized Brigade. On 1 January 1936 the corps was equipped with a total of 563 tanks, including 40 BT-2s, 186 BT-5s, 64 BT-7s, 169 T-26 tanks and variants, 68 T-37 amphibious tanks, 33 T-27 tankettes, and three T-18 tanks. Komdiv Mikhail Bukshtynovich led the corps from August 1935 or the end of 1936 until his arrest in 1938. Komdiv Prokofy Romanenko took command of the corps in January 1938. By 1938, the corps headquarters was at Luga. In May 1938 the corps became the 10th Tank Corps and its mechanized brigades became tank brigades. = Second Formation = The corps (Military Unit Number 6850) began forming on 8 July 1940 in the Moscow Military District from the 39th and 55th Light Tank Brigades, and the 1st Motorized Division. The corps headquarters was formed from that of the 57th Rifle Corps. The 14th Tank Division was formed from the 55th Light Tank Brigade and the 18th Tank Division from the 39th Light Tank Brigade. The final prewar locations of the units were: Corps headquarters at Moscow, 14th Tank Division at Naro-Fominsk (Summer camp at Kubinka), 18th Tank Division at Kaluga, the 1st Motorized Division at Moscow (Summer camp at Alabino). The corps was commanded by Major General Vasily Vinogradov. On 22 June, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, began. At the time, the corps had a strength of 959 tanks. The corps was put on alert for movement to the front and on 24 June was ordered to join the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in the Gzhatsk District. The corps headquarters, the tanks, and the 12th Tank and 13th Artillery Regiments of the 1st Motorized Division were transported by rail. The remainder of the corps moved by road, led by the remainder of the 1st Motorized Division. While passing through Gzhatsk, the corps received new orders to concentrate at Vyazma. While moving to Vyazma, the corps received new order, directing it to move to Yartsevo and then Smolensk. The final destination of the corps was to be Orsha. On the night of 26 June corps headquarters arrived at Smolensk, but could go no further due to congestion. The 1st Motorized Division took positions west of Orsha. The corps became part of the 20th Army, and without the 1st Motorized Division (which operated separately for the rest of the battle), was ordered to counterattack in conjunction with the 5th Mechanized Corps and advance to Beshankovichy, Lepel, and Senno. On 6 July, the corps had 571 tanks, including 34 KV tanks (from the Kirov plant) and 29 T-34 tanks (from the Kharkov Tank School). Most of its tanks were older types, such as 269 T-26 tanks and 196 BT tanks. Burning T-34 tank of the type used by the corps By the time it went into battle, the strength of the corps had been reduced to 428 tanks due to breakdowns. The corps attacked without air support, and with a shortage of fuel, ammunition, and anti-aircraft guns. The 5th Mechanized Corps stopped its advance due to fuel shortages. When the corps reached its starting positions for the counterattack, Vinogradov sent the 14th and 18th Tank Divisions forward without a reserve. The corps advanced 48 to 58 kilometers on 6 July and advanced to the area north and south of Senno, where it ran into the lines of the 7th Panzer Division. The 14th Tank Division lost half of its tanks in an attack on 7 July. The 18th Tank Division was defeated by the 20th Panzer Division and the 20th Motorized Division. After a failed attack on the 17th Panzer Division, the 14th Tank Division began a retreat. Digging in along the Vitebsk-Smolensk road, the 14th Tank Division repulsed attacks by the 12th Panzer Division. The corps withdrew east across the Dnieper to the Orsha region, where it received replacement tanks and new attack orders for 11 July. The corps was subordinated to the 19th Army. The attack in support of 19th Army south of Vitebsk resulted in the loss of a combined 100 tanks from both the 5th and 7th Mechanized Corps. By 14 July, the 14th Tank Division had been encircled and destroyed around Liozno. The corps was encircled in the pocket between Smolensk and Orsha by 15 July. Corps headquarters and two tank battalions broke out and joined Rokossovsky's group. On 21 July, the corps was ordered withdrawn to the Sukhinichi area as part of the 4th Army and reformed as a tank division. Instead, the corps became part of Rokossovsky's Group Yartsevo, and participated in a counterattack toward Dukhovshchina on 28 July. During the counterattack, the corps captured Svishchevo, south of Yartsevo. The corps headquarters became part of the Group Yartsevo headquarters. = Third Formation = The corps was reformed between 1 August and 30 September 1943 near Solnechnogorsk in the Moscow Military District.

Jean-Edme studied theology until 1763 and was called to the ministry in 1763. Three years later, he was called as pastor of the Walloon church in London but his delicate health not accommodating to the climate, he returned to Geneva and was ordered to serve the church of Chancy. He married Fran√ßoise Doroth√©e Argand (1748‚Äì1797), with whom he had a daughter, Marie Jos√©phine Romilly (1770‚Äì1823). In 1770, the Council of State of Geneva granted him his resignation, \\"retaining him his rank, given his distinguished talents.\\" Charles Palissot de Montenoy, who knew him specifically, painted a man of gentle and regular manners, highly educated and endowed with the most amiable modesty. He left the reputation of a good preacher. His sermons were distinguished by a soft and persuasive unction rather than by a strong and male eloquence. In 1780, pastor Jean-Jacques Juventin published in Geneva a collection of his sermons in 2 vol. in-8¬∞, putting ahead the √âloge of the author. A friend of Rousseau, d'Alembert, Diderot and Voltaire, like his father Jean-Edme Romilly worked for the Encyclop√©die to which he contributed the articles Tol√©rance and Vertu.

The film stars debutant Yash Dasgupta with Mimi Chakraborty in leading roles. The film is a romantic thriller where Yash plays the role of a Gangster. The film has been shot in Istanbul, Turkey. The film released on 7 October 2016. Plot The movie begins in present time, on the anniversary of Kabir and Ruhi. While Kabir shops for his wife and is returning home, he is shot by four masked gangsters. Just before falling out a fifth person shoots him. He is taken to hospital and a shocked Ruhi arrives to see him. The film then takes a flashback to how Kabir became Guru, the gangster. In a jail years ago, a young Kabir sits terrified as an older prisoner named Jamal comes and tells him to kill his cell mate to prove his worth as a criminal . In return he would be freed. Kabir does so. Jamal tells him to work with him and calls him 'Beta'. Kabir calls him 'Baba'. Jamal tells him that one day he would rule and will be known as Guru. A few years later, Guru is a renowned gangster of Jamal and works exactly what Jamal tells him. He is always accompanied by his closest friend Ghudi. He is seemingly disturbed and wants to leave his business of being gangster. In an unwanted manner, he goes to kill Vishnu, one of their ex-members of gang. Guru, instead of killing him warns him to run away lest Jamal shall kill him. Later Guru learns Jamal's men have killed Bishnu. Heartbroken, he next goes to Tommy,a ragtag and persuades him to share 70% of business with Jamal. In a party, to celebrate this, Guru sees a conspiracy being built against him by Chhotu, Tommy, Jameson and few others. Later, Guru and Ghudi drive at a point where the conspirators trap them into an accident. The car of Guru is hit. Guru comes out of car and fights with the rest as a pretty girl comes amidst. Guru is attracted towards her and falls for her. Later they meet again at the hospital where Guru pays a hefty amount for expenses of a conspirator whom Ruhi brought to hospital. Over time, Ruhi and Guru get together well. Guru is now least bothered with gang. One day Guru confesses to Ruhi that he is a gangster, but says that he will leave this behind. He proposes to Ruhi and they get married. They then meet Jamal to seek blessings. Jamal asks Guru for a gift. Guru responds by saying he wants live a normal life. Jamal tells him to do so. But all three know that could never happen. In present day, a shattered Ruhi waits for Kabir to gain consciousness. It is revealed that the fifth person who shot Kabir was none other than Ruhi. Ruhi tries to kill Kabir again to make sure he is dead. But the police inspector's arrival stops her. Just as Kabir gains consciousness, the duo reconcile and Ruhi pretends to be normal. Back at home, Kabir calls Jamal to find who shot him. Meanwhile, Ghudi has find out the shooters were Tommy, Chhotu, Jamal, Jameson. But doesn't know who is the fifth person. Kabir tells Ruhi that he knows who all shot him and this scares her as she feels Kabir knows she shot him. Just as it seems things are about to go worse, Ghudi enters with his wife and son. Ruhi, Kabir and Ghudi leave hospital for Kabir's treatment. At the hospital parking lot, Ruhi is attacked by goons. Kabir arrives in time, but it too late to save Kabir and Ruhi's unborn child. Disturbed, Kabir decides to resort to violence as he kills all those who shot him one by one. First, Chhotu then Jameson and Tommy. Meanwhile, trying to save Ruhi, Ghudi is killed. At last, he goes to kill Jamal, after a few encounters he kills Jamal in the same way he had killed his cellmate. Meanwhile, the police inspector comes to know that the fifth person who shot Kabir was none other than Ruhi. He goes to warn Kabir, to arrest him alive. At Ruhi's mothers shop, Kabir arrives in a tired and hurt condition. Together, they leave for the place where they had first met. Kabir narrates that his changing from Guru the gangster to Kabir was just a small incident but real story began when Ruhi shot him. He wants to know why she did so. But Ruhi demands it's useless to say as Kabir is going to die. Saying this she points her gun towards Kabir. Kabir it was awful, having lost his friend Ghudi as well as his unborn child and it's better he dies. Ruhi then reveals she was never pregnant, and goons who attacked her was well plotted. Kabir also comes to know it was she who let the gangsters kill Ghudi. Ruhi then reveals her romance with Kabir was a plot to get him killed in a violent way and not as a loving husband. She then says her plot was to revenge the death of her late husband Bishnu, whom Ruhi presumes to be shot by Kabir. Kabir smiles and says he never shot him, it was Chhotu. Hearing this Ruhi is perplexed and realises how Kabir has blindly loved her and she exploited his love. Slowly, a mentally broken Kabir walks into the middle of the road saying he is disturbed to know Ruhi did not love him. Ruhi realises that she in fact loves him, but is ashamed of what she did. A car rams into Kabir and he is dead. Ruhi runs to save him, crying. The film ends with Ruhi crying with Kabir's voice ringing in her head that he is now far away and sometimes to come closer, you need stay separated.

They were the sons of Johan Marinus Struben (1806 Oosterwijk, Holland), a South African Republic official, and his wife Frances Sarah Beattie of Scottish origin. Harry was born during a yacht trip along the Lower Rhine. His family emigrated to Pietermaritzburg in Natal in 1850, and moved to Pretoria five years after. Harry started as a transport rider, carrying goods between Natal and the Transvaal. In 1862 he bought the farm 'The Willows' on the outskirts of Pretoria. He also took to prospecting and found deposits of gold, copper and iron. In January 1868 he was married Mary L. Cole and they raised a family of eight children. In 1872 he and a certain Piet Marais bought two farms in the Lydenburg district. Harry was elected to the Volksraad in October 1876, representing the constituency of Pretoria East. Having been hard hit financially by the First Anglo-Boer War (1880-1881) Struben embarked on mining ventures with his younger brother, Frederick. They founded the Sterkfontein Junction Mining Syndicate in 1884, exploring the farms Sterkfontein and Swartkrans. At the time their efforts focused almost entirely on quartz reefs, little realising that gold on the Witwatersrand was confined primarily to conglomerate beds. In August 1884 Fred came across a promising quartz outcrop on the farm Wilgespruit and it was named Confidence Reef. The Transvaal government assisted in financing its exploitation in 1885, but the yields proved to be disappointing. Their mining activities attracted other fortune- seekers to the area, and the extremely rich Main Reef conglomerate was found on the farm Langlaagte in 1886. Struben was elected to the first Diggers' Committee in Johannesburg in March 1887, and later that same year became the first president of the Chamber of Mines, founded to promote the mining industry in the Transvaal. He also served as board member for a number of mining companies, and was first Director (1875-6) of the Delagoa Bay Railway. In 1889 he sold his mining rights on the farms Driefontein and Vogelstruisfontein, and retired to Rosebank, Cape Town. Ill-health curtailed his activities, but even so he enjoyed his membership of the South African Philosophical Society during the 1890s. His one contribution to geology came as a chapter on \\"The mineral wealth of the Transvaal\\" in \\"Diamonds and Gold in the Transvaal\\" (1893) by T. Reunert. His \\"Recollections of adventures: Pioneering and development in South Africa, 1850-1911\\" (Cape Town, 1920) was revised and edited by his daughter Edith. Strubenskop in Pretoria and Strubens Valley in Johannesburg were named after the brothers. During the two Anglo- Boer Wars Struben remained a staunch supporter of the Boer cause. https://archive.org/details/recollectionsofa00strurich External links *\\"Recollections of adventures: Pioneering and development in South Africa, 1850-1911\\" References 1840 births 1915 deaths Randlords Members of the Volksraad of the South African Republic South African mining businesspeople German emigrants to South Africa ","title":"Harry Struben"},{"id":"51416055","text":"Dragomir A.

Subsequently, travellers, missionaries, military personnel and scholars contributed to the development of collections outside Ethiopia. In Europe, the three biggest collections of Ethiopian manuscripts are in Rome (Biblioteca Apostolica Vatican), in Paris (Biblioth√®que nationale de France) and in London (British Library). These three organisations together hold about 2,700 manuscripts.

Its collection of 151 codices and 83 scrolls of spiritual healing (also known as magical scrolls) is only surpassed by four larger collections (Christian/Ge'ez unless otherwise noted): The collection at the Department of Semitic and Egyptian Languages / Institute of Christian Oriental Studies at Catholic University in Washington, DC, with 375 codices (of which 177 are Islamic) plus three codex quires and 374 scrolls; the Library of Congress‚Äôs Kane collection, with 211 codices and 83 scrolls; UCLA's collection, with 203 codices and 110 scrolls; and Princeton‚Äôs collection, with 177+ (some Amharic) and 678 scrolls. The size of the Tweed collection alone makes it important, but in addition to the more common Psalters and service books, the Tweed collection also contains several manuscripts that are of greater significance due to their age and contents. Perhaps the most significant is a possibly 14th or 15th century Acts of Paul codex. The Acts of Paul is part of the New Testament Apocrypha. Fragments of a 16th century psalter including illuminations of the Madonna and child, St. George, the trinity, and the annunciation, is the next oldest codex holding. A 17th or 18th century collection of the Minor Prophets with Christian commentary is another significant codex. Andr√© Tweed was an alumnus of Howard University‚Äôs Medical School and the first African American board-certified psychiatrist in California. He became interested in Ethiopian manuscripts and artifacts and bought many codices, scrolls of spiritual healing, crosses, and other artifacts during his lifetime. When he became terminally ill with cancer, he sought a permanent, appropriate resting place for his prized possessions. That is how the collection came to be part of Howard University School of Divinity‚Äôs (HUSD's) collection. Because of the lack of awareness of the collection on the part of the scholarly world, it has not been accessed frequently by scholars. However, in the academic year 2005-06, Gay Byron, the Baptist Missionary Training School Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School, traveled to Washington, DC, during her sabbatical year in which her focus was Ge‚Äôez (Classical Ethiopic) and its usefulness for New Testament research, to see the Tweed collection. With the help of Dr. Henry Ferry, formerly Associate Professor of Church History and Associate Dean of HUSD, and Dr. Alice Ogden Bellis, she photographed the entire Acts of Paul codex for her own scholarly research. In addition to the Acts of Paul, the psalter fragment, and Minor Prophets codices, among the older books are the following from the 18th century: a life of St. Cyrus with 53 illuminated portraits, a life of St. Graba, a liturgical text with two illuminated portraits, a treatise on the Trinity, eight Psalters, some with illuminated pages, a Malka Sellasse Trinity, two Mashafa Genzats (burial liturgies), an 18th or 19th century Deggwa (hymnbook) and a second fragment of a Deggwa, a Prayer of Peter along with other religion- magical prayers, another fragment of prayers from a religio-magical text, and a Dersana Michael ‚Äì four readings for the festival of the Archangel including two 20th century paintings. Included among the 19th and 20th century codices are a Prayer of St. Simon Stylite, a Book of the Miracles of Mary including several illuminations, an Ecumenical book of Mary with two portraits, several Miracles of Mary and similar texts, a Homily Hymnbook of St. Michael with a drawing of St. Michael and one of Haile Selassie, many Deggwas (hymnbooks), Psalters, various prayer books, various liturgical books, numerous Gospels of Johns, other Gospel books, New Testament collections without the Gospels, and many religio-magical books. In addition to the manuscripts, there are a variety of other artifacts: silver pectoral crosses, processional crosses made of various materials (silver, brass, copper, iron, wood) ‚Äì some on generally later wooden shafts, silver hand crosses, silver star of David pendants, other necklaces ‚Äì some made of silver or wooden beads, bracelets, rings, a pocket watch, seals, hair ornaments, coins, artwork of various sorts including a late 15th or early 16th century painted diptych and many other diptychs and triptychs of religious subjects, musical instruments including a lyre, a bronze and wood sistrum (a kind of rattle), a one string violin, a kalimbi or hand piano, eating and drinking vessels such as bowls, vases, water jugs, baskets, and even a horse hair wooden wisk, masks, headrests, stools, and a leather bridle. Gebra Paulos and Gebra Sarabamon, also known as Tweed 150, was returned to Debre Libanos Monastery on January 11, 2016, by a contingent from the Howard University School of Divinity community, including Dean Alton B. Pollard III, Associate Dean Gay Byron, Professor Alice Ogden Bellis, student Lawrence Rodgers, pastor of a church in Baltimore, and Memher Zebene Lemma, a double alumnus of HUSD and the head priest of Debre Genet MedhaneAlem (Mount Paradise Savior of the World), one of the largest Ethiopian Orthodox churches in the Washington, DC, area. Blain Zerihun, the Administrative Assistant of the Associate Dean and a native Ethiopian, was also on hand for the return of the manuscript. This was the first time that any major western institution had returned a manuscript from its collection to Ethiopia. ''' In October 2012 the Howard University School of Divinity community became officially aware that Tweed 150 had been microfilmed as part of a UNESCO project in 1976 when it was in the Debre Libanos collection in Ethiopia. The microfilms taken at that time matched the digitized images that were made as part of a digitization project led by Professor Bellis with the help of chief consultant Stephen Delamarter, Professor at George Fox Evangelical Seminary and also creator of the Ethiopian Manuscript Imaging Project. The match was made as part of the process of cataloguing the collection as a follow-up to the digitizing project. Due to complicated legal, political, and cultural issues, it took three years before it was possible to return Gebra Paulos and Gebra Sarabamon to Debre Libanos Monastery. Finally, with the manuscript having only been appraised and insured within days of departure, the Howard contingent flew directly to Addis Ababa on an Ethiopian Air flight courtesy of Ethiopian Air, arriving on Sunday, January 10, 2016. The delegation then proceeded with the manuscript to Debre Libanos Monastery 110 km away. When they arrived, more than two thousand people were there to greet them. The two-hour ceremony included music, dancing, and liturgical readings. The scripture lesson was the story of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32). =J.

The collection is fully catalogued online.Retrieved August, 2016: http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/C0744.03/c0001 Included in the collection are Psalters, Miracles of Mary, Prayer books, Homilies of Michael, Synaxaria, Anaphora of Addai and Mari, Missals and Gospels. Divination texts are also part of the collection. One of the Miracles of Mary is among the oldest and probably dates to the seventeenth century; the other materials mostly date to the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Garrett acquired most his Ethiopic manuscripts from Enno Littmann who led expeditions to Tigray Region and Axum in 1905 and 1906.Retrieved August, 2016: https://rbsc.princeton.edu/topics/316/divisions/15 The Princeton collection has continued to grow through gift and purchase, and is especially strong in magico-medical scrolls of which there are now more than 500 specimens.For a catalogue by David Appleyard: http://libweb5.princeton.edu/mssimages/ethiopic/index.html Retrieved August, 2016 Of historiographical interest is the pseudepigraphical Book of Enoch (Ge'ez: ·àò·åΩ·àê·çà ·àÑ·äñ·ä≠ m√§t·π£·∏•√§f√§ henok).Retrieved August, 2016: http://pudl.princeton.edu/objects/zc77sr50z The Princeton manuscript, according to a stamp on the old binding, belong to Rev.

The bust is 69 cm (27 in) in height and is currently located in the Hall of the Triumphs within the Capitoline Museums, Rome.Capitoline Brutus. Musei Capitolini . Retrieved August 25, 2016. Traditionally taken to be an early example of Roman portraiture and perhaps by an Etruscan artist influenced by Hellenistic art and contemporary Greek styles of portraiture, it may be \\"an archaizing work of the first century BC\\".Strong, p. 47 The Roman head was provided with a toga-clad bronze bust during the Renaissance. History The bust was discovered in Italy during the 16th century. In 1564 it was bequeathed to the city of Rome by Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi. Its identification as a representation of the ancient Roman statesman Lucius Junius Brutus was first formulated by antiquarians who excavated and examined it during the Renaissance, based on their readings of Roman history. However, there is no direct evidence that it was made to represent Brutus.Brilliant (2002), pp. 55‚Äì6. The first drawing of the bust was made by the Dutch artist Maarten van Heemskerck sometime between 1532‚Äì36, although it was first described in writing in 1549.Holliday (1996), pp. 235‚Äì36. The bust was kept on the Capitoline Hill and from 1627 in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Capitoline Museum), until Pope Pius VI surrendered it to the French First Republic in 1797. It was then used in the triumphal procession of Napoleon Bonaparte in Paris in July 1798.Holliday (1996), p. 236. It was finally returned to Rome and the Palazzo dei Conservatori in 1816, where it has stayed ever since. Antiquarian speculation Profile view of the bust Speculation that the bust was meant to portray Lucius Junius Brutus of antiquity began with the writings of the 16th-century Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi. The Dutch 17th-century antiquary and editor of Lactantius Gallaeus Servatius alleged that a Roman coin minted during the consulship of Brutus bore similar facial features to the bust. The profile of the bust is similar to the profile on a coin, depicting Lucius Junius Brutus, minted by Marcus Junius Brutus following the assassination of Julius Caesar. The 18th- century German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann was not alone among his contemporaries in thinking the bust did not actually portray Brutus. The Italian antiquarian Ennio Quirino Visconti expressed doubt that it truly represented Brutus and was keen to emphasize that the head and bust were not originally made together or for each other. This was an idea that was first suggested in the 17th century when some antiquarians mused that the head originally belonged to a larger bronze statue that once stood on the Capitoline Hill. Modern scholarship More recent scholars of the 20th century have been less concerned with whether or not it was an idealized portrait of Brutus and more preoccupied with the accurate dating and provenance of the bust. It has been identified as being Central Italian in origin with clear influence from Hellenistic-era Greek sculpture and portraiture of the first half of the 3rd century BC. It may come from a full- length statue. It may have honored a public figure during Rome's expansion in the 3rd century BC. However, it is possible it dates to \\"as late as the early first century BC when there was a vogue for creating lively imaginary 'portraits' of early Roman celebrities\\",Rasmussen, Tom, \\"Early Roman Art\\", in Henig, Martin (ed), A Handbook of Roman Art, p. 23, Phaidon, 1983, which the \\"treatment of detail\\" suggests.Strong, p. 47 Portrait of Lucius Junius Brutus on a denarius of Marcus Junius Brutus minted in 54 BC.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 455‚Äì456.

P&G;) is among the few critical psychological academic journals from the 1970s that still exist. P&G; is considered an unorthodox publication organ for critical psychology and as initiator of much discourse pertaining to ‚Ä∫lowercase c‚Äπ critical psychology in the German speaking countries (as opposed to the ‚Ä∫uppercase C‚Äπ Critical Psychology of the Berlin Klaus Holzkamp school).  History Psychology & Social Critique was founded in 1977 as ¬ªPsychology & Society¬´ (German: Psychologie und Gesellschaft) by Siegfied Grubitzsch and G√ºnter Rexilius. Peter Mattes is the only founding member who belongs to the editorial team to this day. The journal was renamed ¬ªPsychology & Social Critique¬´ in 1979 to mark its contrast from the book series called ¬ªPsychology & Society¬´. P&G; was founded as a critical psychological journal but its authors pursued different paths than the Holzkamp school by consciously refraining from developing an overarching theoretical tradition. As a consequence, P&G; refused to be pinned down to a unifying consensus. In contrast to Holzkamp‚Äôs Critical Psychology, Marxist social theory has become somewhat less significant in this process. P&G; is characterized by key topics rather than a theoretical framework. These topics build the central nodes of critical psychological discussion at P&G.; Selected topics (in chronological order) include: psychiatry, psychotherapy, psychosocial practice (1978‚Äì80); psychology and politics, psychology during National Socialism (1979/80); aesthetic practices, mass communication and the media (1981); measurements, the industrialized psyche (1982); therapeutic practice, institutional practice, social control (1983/84); women and social (from 1983); identity , subjectivity , subject and politics (1987/89); National Socialism, euthanasia, and modernization (1991); postmodern challenges, construction, being oneself (1992/93), subject construction and subjectification (1996ff.), gender, childhood, and adolescence (since 2002), critical-psychoanalytic topics and articles (since 2003), and, again and again, critical- deconstructivist reflections on diverse aspects of life, culture, and institutions. Since the 1990s, the journal has witnessed an increasing influence of poststructuralist and discourse analytic concepts and of French and North-American postmodernist philosophy as well as social constructionism. Psychology & Social Critique has considerably diversified social psychologies in the German speaking countries. The critique of psychology, as exemplified by Psychology & Social Critique, deconstructs power and seeks out possibilities, in and around psychology, to think differently, to entertain discourses of ‚Äòdesubjugation‚Äô (Foucault), and to defy the dictates of normal scientific discourse. Since the mid 1990s, the journal is being edited by an editorial collective with alternating members. Editorial members came mostly from the German Federal Republic and the West Berlin scene initially and from German and Austrian universities, where they engaged in research and teaching that offered alternatives to the psychological mainstream, since the 1990s. A heavy focus lay on the universities Bielefeld, Oldenburg, GH Wuppertal, Bremen, FU Berlin, and later Munich, Erlangen-Nurnberg, and Vienna. Over the years, Psychology & Social Critique has reconstructed, accompanied, and actively influenced critical intellectual discourse in and around psychology with its core topics. Psychology & Social Critique is published as a German speaking journal quarterly (two of the four annual issues usually constitute a double issue). P&G; is currently (as of 2014) in its 38th year and will publish its 150th thematic issue in 2014. P&G; participates in the Social Science Open Access Repository (SSOAR) and provides of all articles for download. Papers published within the previous two years are not available for open access.  Objectives Psychology and Social Critique both accompanies and criticizes mainstream psychology and aims at countering efforts to streamline all psychological knowledge into a single natural scientific method. The journal draws upon Anglo-American critical psychological, discourse theory and analysis, narrative and (de-)constructionist approaches, science and technology studies, gender studies, and psychoanalysis beyond the couch. Psychology and Social Critique mainly publishes theoretical papers as well as empirical studies based on qualitative social research.

The program for the national team was launched in 2012, but as of 2016 the team has yet to play an international match. Several games were scheduled but issues came up and Nigeria was unable to travel for these games. Development took place behind the scenes to support a national squad, including hosting a tournament at the National Stadium, Lagos in July 2016. That year, Nigeria was also looking to possibly create a women's national cerebral palsy team.  Background  Power Eagles Cerebral Palsy (CPFAN) manages the national team. The national team coach in 2015 and 2016 was Gbenga Dosumu. In 2015, the team manager was Adegboyega Ganiyu. The sport was first played in Nigeria in 2012 under the direction of the Nigeria Paralympics Committee (NPC). Cerebral palsy football had a limited presence in Africa in 2015, with the sport only being played in Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Ghana and Sierra Leone. In April 2015, a coaching workshop was held in the country to try to further develop the sport. . By 2016, the national team was inactive as leadership tried to set up international matches.

Originally designed as a yacht and despatch vessel for the Italian Head of Government, she was converted for military use. Diana was laid down on 31 May 1939 at the Cantieri Navali del Quarnaro in Fiume, launched on 20 May 1940 and completed on 12 November 1940. The planned main armament consisted of two 90/50 guns, modern anti-aircraft weapons used on the latest Italian battleships, but eventually a pair of old 102/35 4-inch guns was fitted in their place. Six 20 mm Breda 20/65 mod. 35 guns completed the anti-aircraft defence. During the war Diana was used as fast transport for valued cargo. Plans of the Italian Sloop Diana form altomareblu.com/malta-2-lino-mancini/ The ship left Messina, Italy on June 28 1942 to bring material and personnel to Tobruk, a city recently reconquered by the Axis forces. In what he described as his \\"most satisfactory patrol\\" in the Mediterranean, in June 1942, Sir Hugh Mackenzie, Commander of the British submarine , reported that on their way back to Alexandria, north of Tobruk, they received a signal about an enemy ship which was due in the area at 12 o'clock on the following day and that it was vitally important to sink the ship (presumed to be the Diana). The ship wasn't sighted the following day, but during the night, they received another signal about the same ship going to be in a certain position at 12 o'clock on the following day, and; that it was vitally important to sink the ship.

Given the flat waters and calm weather, the submarine had been using very little periscope, but after hearing the torpedoes strike, they lifted the periscope and realised there was an escort of 4-6 anti-submarine boats accompanying the ship they had hit. On 29 June 1942, about 75 miles north of the Gulf of Bomba, Cyrenaica, the Diana found out about the launch of four torpedoes by the English submarine . Two were avoided with a quick pull, but the other two exploded aft (back) causing the sinking of the Diana in less than 15 minutes into position 33 ¬∞ 30 'N and 23 ¬∞ 30' E dragging with it three quarters of the men on board to result in a loss of 336 lives. .

During the French Revolution, he was sent to the National Convention as a member of Gironde, where he would address the issue of national education. He voted for the execution of Louis XVI. On 31 May 1793, the uprising of the Parisian sans-culottes, resulted in the arrest and execution of leading Girondins. Ultimately, this first attempt of the Jacobins to overthrow Robespierre and Jean-Paul Marat using the Parisian sans-culottes to overthrow the Girondins failed. It put an end to the reign of terror that ultimately took place with the popular uprising of 2 June 1793 and the adoption of the Constitution of 24 June 1793. Its peak was reached in June and in July 1794, also called \\"Great Purge\\", la grande terreur. Deleyre was able to elude arrest after 31 May.

Jana ‚Äì 8 February 1975, Zagreb) was a Croatian composer, organist, choir conductor and pedagogue. Biography Juraj Stahuljak (Sv. Jana by Jastrebarsko, 1901 ‚Äì Zagreb, 1975) was the son of Vladimir Stahuljak (Bjelovar, 1876 ‚Äì Zagreb, 1960), the first in the family to have music as one of his professions. After studying composition in Zagreb in 1904, Vladimir Stahuljak set out for Budapest, where at the M. Somogy Conservatory he took a degree in composition. When in addition to his musical education he also acquired a certificate to teach Croatian and German, he was eligible for employment in a number of Croatian cities. His first job was in Sv. Jana near Jastrebarsko, from 1900 to March 1903, where his son Juraj was born on 16 July 1901. The father was posted to various different positions and from 1903 to 1908 he lived with his family, in Remete, from 1908 to 1912 in Koprivnica, from mid-August 1912 to February 1914 in ƒåavle-Cernik over Su≈°ak, and in Su≈°ak itself, to which, after more than a year in Zadar, (March 1914 ‚Äì mid-1915) the father had been forced to flee because of political denunciations on account of his Croatian patriotism, returning for several months, before joining the teaching staff of the Teacher's School in Petrinja in 1915. The family stayed 10 years in Petrinja, from 1915 to 1925; in this period, Vladimir Stahuljak passed the state exam and in 1918 obtained a certificate as music teacher. Then came a fairly short episode in Kragujevac and from 1926 to his retirement in 1932 he was a teacher in Zagreb. This short review of the career of Vladimir Stahuljak seems essential, for every setting in which the family lived up to 1915 left its marks on the composer Juraj Stahuljak. From 1915 to 1919 Juraj Stahuljak attended the Upper Town high school in Zagreb, living the while in the Catholic orphanage called Orfanotrofij, since the family, forced to flee from Zadar, had become poor. After graduating from high school, he first of all enrolled in a law course, and at the same time embarked on a course in the Conservatory of the Croatian Music Institute. Poor financial conditions forced him to maintain himself by playing in a cinema, and this is how he earned his living from 1920 to 1924. However, the study of law did not occupy him enough, and he left it, enrolling in the Faculty of Philosophy, taking the study groups history and geography. He took his degree in 1928 and started to work as teacher of history and geography in Zagreb high schools. He remained in this profession until his retirement in 1956. Coming from a family in which music was part of everyday life, in which the children, with their cellist, composer, choir master and organist father, and their noted singer mother Paula (n√©e Huber) received both musical impulses and professional tuition, along with the obligatory performance of music in the home, Juraj Stahuljak quite naturally devoted himself to the study of music. He attended the Croatian Music Institute Conservatory for five years, his teachers being distinguished educators of that time: in music theory he was taught by ƒÜiril Junek, in piano playing by Vjekoslav Rosenberg-Ru≈æiƒá, in singing by Milan Reizer; he learned harmony in the class of Fran Lhotka, counterpoint and fugue in that of Franjo Dugan Sr, while in vocal composition he received tuition from Antun Dobroniƒá, and in instrumentation from Blagoje Bersa. The very names of these outstanding teachers and composers would tend to suggest a thorough mastery of the musical material. The continuation of his studies at the Zagreb Conservatory, or rather the Royal Conservatory, and after that the Royal Music Academy was crowned with a degree in 1924. The young composer also took a degree in singing and music before a special commission, as the practice of the time required, and he thus became qualified to teach in secondary schools. One of the lasting forms of reproductive music in which Stahuljak was engaged was organ playing in churches, which he began when he was only eleven, standing in for his father; after his arrival in Zagreb for his education he also played it in the Church of St Peter, where he ran the women's voice choir of the church. In addition, he ran the choir of the cadets of Orfanotrofij. He rounded off his career as organist, always in the context of Catholic liturgical practice, with two decades playing the organ of the Parish Church of St John in Zagreb's Nova Ves, in the concluding period from 1956 to 1969. Thus organ playing and choir conducting composed a permanent component in the life of this musician; in addition, one should mention his very frequent work as an accompanist at the piano, particularly together with the distinguished violinist Miroslav ≈†lik in the 1930s. But what particularly picks him out as a creative personality is his work in composition, with which he started as a fifteen-year-old, writing his first work, Fantasy for piano.

Technology  MycoWorks produces its products through a process which involves steam cooking bags of sawdust (or cornhusks) for several hours in airtight bags (to sterilise the growing medium), after which the sawdust or cornhusks are moved into a mold (which has the shape of the final product, ie furniture, ...). In the mold, mushroom tissue (mycelium) is introduced which feeds on the growing medium. The mycelium then grows (into the shape of the mold). Lastly the fungi is killed by putting the whole into an oven, hence stopping additional growth.Making Furniture from FungiMycotecture (Phil Ross) According to co- founder Phil Ross, production of this material is similar to making ravioli from scratch, and the final product is more resilient than cement. Another product made by the company is a leather-like textile. Unlike traditional animal hide leather, the product is made from a mix of fungus and wood fibers. It can be made in any size. The leather product can be made in sheets up to 27 square feet.

She has the perfect blend of taste for art and aesthetics, narratives and organization. Her interests in music, dance and theatre reflect in the seeds of her projects. Vidhi, even with experience spanning over a decade, breaks all stereotypical conventions of filmmaking in India. She has immense belief in structured functioning and maintains that as the secret to her success at multi-tasking. Very early in her career, Vidhi learnt that filmmaking is not a lonely job; it‚Äôs a team effort with each member playing an equally important role. This outlook can be well considered a result of Vidhi‚Äôs culturally rich upbringing and her involvement in various aspects of cinema and filmmaking. She currently has very many Hindi, Marathi and Documentary features of various genres in the pipeline. It is her hunger for creativity and fresh content that has given the producer in her a lead, while she continues to work with newer people and diverse stories. Vidhi Kasliwal is a woman with a vision along with knowledge, skill and the right attitude. She is all about presenting personal cinema with global appeal and that‚Äôs where she is the happiest!\\" Early & Personal life Born and brought up in Mumbai, Vidhi has had a culturally and musically rich upbringing.

Characteristically dressed in laboratory-coats, their output has been described as a \\"strong commentary to our technological existence\\".  Biography  Hemmelig Tempo made their first public appearance dressed in white laboratory coats in Bergen, Norway in 2007. Combining a quasi-scientific approach with performance, improvisation and avant-garde electronical sound art, the group became known for their satirical role-play and \\"live research\\" performances featuring a vast number of diy electronical gadgets, synthesizers, transistor radios, household objects and machines. During the Bergen Electronic Music & Art Festival in 2008, the group contributed with an installation in which the group replaced themselves with three toy robots producing random Aleatoric music. Reflecting the group's sense of satire, the installation was called Do we really need musicians?. The same year, the group also collaborated with the Norwegian contemporary dance ensemble Molitrix for a series of dance performances called Skin. Across the following years, the group produced a series of YouTube videos with titles such as 6 Unlikely Duos, 4 Unlikely Trios, and Bicycle Mixing Session. The latter experiment in Spatial music, described as a combination of a public health initiative and sound- engineering, consisted of three bicycles equipped with an amplifier and speaker which transmitted the sound of pre-recorded musical instruments. By placing microphones at each extreme side of a large-sized hall and manoeuvering the bicycles around the hall, a giant mixing system was in effect created, \\"allowing unpredictable volume and panning effects that could not be replicated with a normal mixing board\\" (op.cit). Here possibly making a reference to Kraftwerk's well documented interest in bicycles, Hemmelig Tempo has consistently placed themselves within the tradition of electronic music by making references to composers such as Arne Nordheim and John Cage in their album releases. The group also collaborated with other artist, film-makers and ensembles during the next years, including making sound-design for the contemporary dance ensemble Winter Guests, appearing in a Visual Dissertation short film produced by Amehn Productions and shown at the Borealis Film Festival, collaborating with actors Liv Ullmann, Dennis Storh√∏i and Anders Baasmo Christiansen on a short, unreleased Radio play, and improvising live in a series of performances with Carte Blanche, the largest contemporary dance ensemble in Norway, in 2016.  Releases  In 2011, the group released the album Who Put John Cage on the Guestlist on a sublabel of the French label Musea. The album received good reviews and was quoted as one of the Favorite Releases of the year by the US online magazine Asymmetry Music Magazine. One reviewer referred to the music as some of the most uncompromising electronic music I've ever encountered, while another described it as totally experimental, far out, challenging, sometimes exciting, sometimes a bit too weird but always intriguing for patient people. In 2012, the group contributed with two tracks for the compilation Muu For Ears 9, produced by MUU, an artist run, Finnish interdisciplinary artist association, founded in 1987 to represent and promote new and experimental forms of art. The same year, the group also contributed on two tracks on the album Magic Handshake by the Norwegian space-rock band Seid. In 2016, the group released the album Are You Part of Some Kind of Cult?, a concept album about an island of pseudo-science worshippers, inspired by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In 2017, Professor Waffel released a solo album, Assemblages, constructed around tiny sampled fragments of classical modernist and ethnic music, field recordings, foley and live performances on a number of acoustic and electronic instruments.

They succeeded in raising sufficient funds to persuade the Treasury to take Brownsea Island as settlement of death duties, which was accepted provided that the National Trust took over the island.Victoria Ward, \\"Father and Son Locked in Legal Battle over Trust Fund\\" The Telegraph (1 August 2013). However, this was also subject to payment to the Treasury of ¬£100,000 - which the National Trust did not have. An arrangement was finally reached whereby three other parties contributed ¬£25,000 each: The Dorset Wildlife Trust - provided they could run half the island; the John Lewis Partnership - for a 99-year lease of the castle & grounds (for staff holidays); and the Scout & Guide Movements - provided they could have access to the rest of the Island for their members.Brownsea Island There is a monument to Mary Bonham-Christie in the churchyard at Marston Bigot; her remains were cremated at Bournemouth, and although the local paper said her ashes were scattered at Brownsea Island, the memorial at Marston Bigot states that her ashes are at Bournemouth crematorium.

While no charges against Serebrennikov have been filed, some of Russia's most prominent cultural figures saw the publicized raid of his apartment as a political gesture, discouraging Serebrennikov and others from criticizing the government. (Serebrennikov had criticised the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and has spoken out in support of Russia‚Äôs LGBT community.) Vladimir Urin, and Yevgeny Mironov, among others, in May 2017 expressed their support of Serebrennikov in a letter passed on to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a public function.

The film stars John Goodman, Ashton Sanders, Jonathan Majors, Colson Baker, and Vera Farmiga, and follows a young man who participates in a conspiracy to rebel against an alien race that has invaded Earth and forced strict martial law on all humans. It was released in the United States on March 15, 2019, by Focus Features. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb, grossing just $8 million against its $25 million budget.  Plot  In 2019, Chicago is placed under martial law after a global extraterrestrial invasion. As the Drummond family attempts to flee the city, they break through a barricade but are confronted by the aliens, who vaporize the parents but leave their sons Gabriel and Rafe alive. By 2027, the world has capitulated to the alien \\"Legislators\\", submitting to their governance. Humans are conscripted to build \\"Closed Zones\\", underground habitats for the aliens with access only granted by high government officials. Gabriel Drummond (Ashton Sanders), living in the impoverished Pilsen neighborhood, is confronted by Chicago Police Special Branch Commander William Mulligan (John Goodman), who was partnered with Gabriel's father before the invasion. Mulligan is convinced that the Phoenix resistance group has not been neutralized, contrary to what the public has been told, but Gabriel offers him no information. Gabriel meets with a member of Phoenix to sell a hand-rolled cigarette containing secret information received from a coworker. The man takes him to Wicker Park, where he meets his brother Rafe (Majors), the leader of the resistance. Rafe takes the coded cigarette and directs Gabriel to leave as Phoenix is planning to attack the upcoming Unity Rally at Soldier Field. Rushing to his apartment and hastily packing, Gabriel is again confronted by Mulligan, who had him under surveillance. Gabriel evades Mulligan and hides underground. The cigarette‚Äôs code allows Rafe's team to access Chicago's surveillance system and the deployment patterns of law enforcement units. Rafe and other Phoenix members attack the Unity Rally, using an invisible alien explosive device against the aliens when they arrive. The attack initially appears successful, but the city is subsequently locked down and swarmed by security forces in response. Angered by the attack, the aliens bring in hunters from off-world to seek out the perpetrators, finding Rafe and his accomplices Anita (Caitlin Ewald) and Daniel (Ben Daniels). Anita is vaporized and Daniel ingests a cyanide pill to avoid capture, but Rafe is shot and arrested by Mulligan before he can take cyanide. Gabriel emerges from hiding but is taken into custody during a police raid. Mulligan shows him his brother being tortured for information and convinces him to send a message through the Phoenix network in hopes of meeting the supposed ringleader, Number One. Gabriel is eventually led to Jane Doe, a prostitute running a brothel in Pilsen, who acknowledges him by name, confusing Gabriel. Police raid the house, and Doe is killed. The subsequent investigation reveals that Doe bugged her own residence to record conversations with Special Branch members and glean classified information. The tapes reveal that Police Commissioner Eugene Igoe (Kevin Dunn) divulged sensitive information about the aliens' arrival to Soldier Field which allowed Phoenix to develop their attack strategy. Igoe, along with Rafe and many others, are deported off-world and Mulligan, declaring the Chicago threat neutralized, is promoted to Acting Commissioner. Mulligan meets with Gabriel privately, with Gabriel lamenting that Rafe's plan failed. Mulligan, retrieving a box earlier received from Doe, reveals a BlackBerry phone, giving the memory card to Gabriel and suggesting that failure was the plan all along. Gabriel reviews the card‚Äôs contents ‚Äî a video depicting his own baby shower, and revealing Jane Doe taught at the same school as his mother. It was at the shower that she was introduced to Mulligan, with several Phoenix members present, and the video closes with Mulligan leaving a message for Gabriel, inspiring him to carry the torch of Phoenix. Meanwhile, Mulligan is cleared to meet with the Legislators underground. As he descends, the invisible substance of the powerful alien explosive envelops him, indicating he is part of the resistance and that the whole 'failed' plan was orchestrated to allow him to deal a fatal blow to the Legislators. During the credits, a map details that the Closed Zone was successfully destroyed, with other resistance strikes and protests having broken out in cities all over the world, indicating that the opening exhortation to \\"spark a match and ignite a war\\" has led humanity to attempt to overthrow their alien oppressors.

It debuted to $3.1 million, finishing seventh. = Critical response = On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 45% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 5.35/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"This sci-fi thriller may not necessarily leave viewers in a Captive State, but it offers reasonably diverting alien invasion action with ambitious political undertones.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, and filmgoers at PostTrak gave it 2 out of 5 stars. In a middling review for The A.V. Club, A.A. Dowd wrote \\"It's not unreasonable to expect something like excitement out of a story about freedom fighters plotting to take back the planet. Captive State does not clear that fairly low bar.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, describing it as \\"[v]isually murky, choppily edited and lacking both narrative clarity and well-defined characterizations,\\" while the Los Angeles Timess Gary Goldstein was also critical of the film, writing: \\"In Captive State aliens have taken over the world (as they will), but it's the viewers stuck watching this messy, lugubrious sci-fi thriller who may feel like the ones being held captive.\\"  References   External links   Alien invasions in films Dystopian films Amblin Partners American films American science fiction thriller films Films about extraterrestrial life Films about rebellions Films about terrorism in the United States Drone films Films directed by Rupert Wyatt Films scored by Rob Simonsen Films set in 2019 Films set in 2027 Films set in Chicago Films set in the future Films shot in Chicago Focus Features films Participant Media films DreamWorks Pictures films ","title":"Captive State"},{"id":"51416951","text":"Early College High School (ECHS) is a public high school in Harlingen, Texas. It is a specialized dual enrollment school (part of the ECHS initiative by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) which offers students the ability to earn up to 2 years of college credit at no cost at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), focusing in 5 general areas: education, engineering, computer science, medical sciences, and college academic core curriculum requirements. Each class is capped at 100 students each (for a max total student population of 400), which encourages a small learning community to support educational success. It is an open-enrollment campus available to all who live in the Rio Grande Valley, with a special focus in recruiting at-risk students and historically underrepresented minorities. The application process for rising freshmen places special consideration on the student's personal goals, college preparedness, academic success, and demographic background. In 2018, 92% of students were Hispanic, 57% were female, and 61% were economically disadvantaged. Harlingen ECHS offers a challenging academic program in grades 9th and 10th geared toward college readiness and project based learning, with full college transition and immersion for respective 11th and 12th grade levels. ECHS does not offer school team sports (football, cheerleading, marching band, soccer, etc.); however, it does offer physical education (PE) classes. Students interested in joining high school team sports are allowed to join teams at Harlingen High School or Harlingen High School South. In February 2019, UTRGV, the city of Harlingen, and Harlingen Consolidated Independent School District (HCISD) signed a memorandum announcing the building of a new Early College High School campus. It will replace the original campus located at Pecan Street across from Texas State Technical College Harlingen (TSTC) and the Valley International Airport. The new $14M state-of-the-art campus will be built on Medical Drive near the UTRGV Regional Academic Health Center and Valley Baptist Medical Center, just off South 77 Sunshine Strip. The new 35,000-40,000 sqft building is scheduled to open in 2021.  Academic Rankings  In 2018, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), which is the highest rank obtainable on the scale. Harlingen Early College High School received 5 Distinction Designations: ELA/Reading, Mathematics, Science, Comparative Closing the Gaps, and Postsecondary Readiness. Student performance on the Texas state public school standardized tests, STAAR, are also far above average. 97% of ECHS students pass all subjects, compared to the 77% average for the school district and state. US News' Best High School 2019 rankings gives Harlingen ECHS an overall score of 89.31/100, ranking it as the #1 high school in Harlingen, #173 in Texas, and #1,843 in the US. In 2015, Newsweek's America's Top High Schools ranking placed ECHS at #84 on the prestigious ‚ÄúBeating the Odds‚Äù list. Newsweek only selects up to 500 US high schools based on their outstanding efforts in preparing their students for college while also overcoming the obstacles posed by students at an economic disadvantage. Harlingen ECHS received high marks for all three categories: college readiness (87.3%), graduation rate (100%), and college bound (96.7%). GreatSchools.org rates ECHS a 9 out of 10, and gave the school the 2019 College Success Award based on its success in preparing students for college.  History  Harlingen Consolidated Independent School District (HCISD) established Early College High School in Fall 2007, creating the 3rd public high school (and the 1st specialized high school) in the city. It initially had a partnership with Texas State Technical College Harlingen (TSTC), which offered high school students the opportunity to complete an associate degree or Certificate program at no cost. The ECHS students who successfully graduated from TSTC usually received an Associate of Science in Biology, a Certificate of Completion in the Academic Core Curriculum, or a Certificate of Completion in the Certified Nurse Assistant Program. The original ECHS campus was located on Pecan Street, across from the TSTC Harlingen campus and next to the TSTC on- campus dorms. Students would take high school classes at the ECHS campus and would walk across the street to take college classes at TSTC Harlingen. The Owl mascot was adopted in 2007. It follows the HCISD tradition of high school bird mascots, where the Owl was chosen specifically to symbolically represent ECHS's academic focus and mission. The mascot's illustration is an altered and recolored (retired) 1997 primary logo from Rice University. The primary color Black was chosen to represent the traditional color of graduation gowns, and the secondary color Khaki was inspired by the faculty's tendency to wear khaki colored slacks when representing ECHS at official HCISD functions. While Khaki is one of the official colors, Yellow and Gold is often substituted in its place for ECHS event decorations, printed banners and brochures, letterman jackets, and diplomas. The first time ECHS had a full school of 4 classes (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors) began in the academic school year of 2010‚Äì11, as the school did not accept student transfers planning to graduate in 2008, 2009, or 2010. The original four classes of ECHS students are the Classes of 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. The first class to graduate from Harlingen Early College High School was the Class of 2011, and were therefore officially named the \\"Legacy Class\\" by the school district. The Harlingen ECHS National Honor Society chapter was established in Fall 2009. Juniors and Seniors are invited to join the organization if they meet the minimum required GPA for entrance. The first Pep Rally took place during the 2011‚Äì12 academic school year. Its focus was to get students excited for an upcoming robotics competition that the Harlingen ECHS Robotics club was participating in. The competition took place at TSTC Harlingen, where the ECHS Robotics team received 2nd place. The first Owl mascot costume was purchased later in 2014. Beginning in Fall 2017 (and on ECHS's 10 year anniversary), Early College High School ended their partnership with TSTC and entered into a new agreement with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV). HCISD provides transportation to UTRGV college classes. Students in the Class of 2019 were the first to graduate under the UTRGV program. In April 2019, the ECHS Robotics team became the first high school in HCISD to advance to the FIRST Robotics World Championship competition hosted at Houston, Texas. Harlingen ECHS students were given the chance to compete with high school engineering and robotics teams from around the world after winning the Alamo West Regional Championship.

Domenic Carosa launched the company in 2009 with a mobile app that focused on providing crowd sourced expert answers to customer questions. It has acquired a number of startups since its foundation, including Dutch firm Track Holdings for AU$35 million. Crowd Mobile was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2015 and raised AU$3.8 million in pre-IPO funding in the same year. The company earned record financials in 2016, and also a 59% growth in the number of questions billed when compared to the previous year. It did so in part by dividing the wages of illegally employed foreign students by three. History Domenic Carosa founded Crowd Mobile in 2009 after leaving his previous role with the Destra Corporation. The mobile app was created so users could pay to ask experts to answer their questions, with each question billed at a set amount. In 2014, the company's financials showed that Crowd Mobile had processed more than 3.4 million questions. The total questions generated AU$9.8 million in revenue, which gave the company a gross income of AU$2.2 million for the financial year. According to an article in ZDNet, the company had expanded to operate in 13 countries by 2015. During the same year, Q Limited acquired the Australian company in a reverse-takeover. Shortly after the takeover, the company raised AU$3.8 million in pre-IPO funding prior to its IPO listing. It was reported that Artesian Venture Partners' crowdfunding platform VentureCrowd was responsible for AU$363,000 of the pre-IPO funding. During the same year, plans were announced for Crowd Mobile to diversify into the micro job market. Following the IPO their 2015 market capitalisation was set at AU$15 million, after originally being listed at 20c a share. Crowd Mobile announced shortly after the IPO that it would be acquiring the Dutch firm, Track Holdings, for a reported AU$35 million. Additional funding was also raised during the same year, with AU$2 million raised from a round of funding. Any Questions Answered (AQA Mobile) was also acquired for $165,000. In March 2016, Crowd Mobile announced a partnership deal with Newzulu. The partnership service will allow citizen journalists, photographers and videographers to submit news content via an app that has been developed in partnership with Newzulu. Later that year, Sky News reported that Crowd Mobile had achieved record financial results. There was more than a six-fold increase in earnings to $3.25 million for the three months to March 31, when compared with the same quarter from the previous year. Third-quarter revenue also tripled to $11.5 million when compared to the previous year. Crowd Mobile's billed messages also rose by 59% from a year ago, and rose by 9% when compared to the previous quarter.

Life She was born to captain Emanuel Meyer and Johanne Mohlholm, and married captain Thomas de Malleville in 1763. After the queen had entered into a love affair with Struensee in 1770, a reform was introduced to allow non-nobles invitations to the royal table, were etiquette was relaxed, and members of the rich burgher class were commonly invited to dine with the royal family. Officially introduced as a reform through which the monarch was given opportunity to meet his subjects, the real reason was thought to be a wish to Struensee to introduce the queen to people outside of the nobility, among whom she could meet friends likely to be more favorable to his reforms. Johanne Marie Malleville belongs to those non-noble women invited who actually did become a personal friend and favorite of the queen. After having been introduced at one such informal dinner, Malleville was from that time forward often seen in the company of the queen at the card table and other events at court. In conservative circles, the presence of Malleville at court and among the friends of the queen was seen as shocking. The queen was already regarded to be exposed to bad influence from her circle of friends of Elisabet von Eyben, Anna Sofie B√ºlow, Christine Sophie von G√§hler and Amalie Sofie Holstein, and the fact that the queen was allowed to mix with women not belonging to the nobility was seen as further scandalous, in particular as Malleville behaved at court as a noblewoman, losing considerable amounts of money at the card table and taking the lover of Anna Sofie B√ºlow, the courtier and noble Frederik Karl von Warnstedt, as a lover. At the fall of Struensee in January 1772, her spouse, in his capacity of a member of the military, actually belonged to those arresting Struensee. For this, he was awarded with a post in the colony of Saint Thomas in the Caribbean. Johanne Marie Malleville did not follow him there but remained in Copenhagen. In 1780, she divorced her spouse because of infidelity on his part and the following year she married count Verner Schulenburg.

Early life Diamond was born Alice Elizabeth Black in Lambeth Workhouse Hospital to Thomas Diamond and Mary Ann Alice Blake. Her parents had applied for a maternity birth under the name of Black before they married to avoid the stigma of an illegitimate birth. However, as they married shortly before Alice was born, this also avoided the problem. Her father, Thomas Diamond, had at least three criminal convictions, including one for assaulting the son of the Lord Mayor of London at a political meeting by punching his head through a pane of glass in a door, severely injuring him. Alice's mother was born Mary Geary and took the name Black when her parents married. She added Ann and Alice to her name at random times. Alice was the eldest of seven children, a younger sister Louisa also joined the Forty Thieves gang of which Alice Diamond had become leader and given the title Queen of the Forty Thieves and, later, Queen of the Forty Elephants, because of their connection to the streets around the Elephant and Castle district of southeast London. A brother, Tommy, became one of the notorious Elephant and Castle gang. Career Diamond's criminal career began in 1912 when she was cautioned, along with Mary Austin, who would later marry north London racing gangster Frederick Sabini, for stealing chocolate. A number of convictions for theft followed and in 1915 she was named by police and newspapers as Queen of the Forty Thieves, successor to Mary 'Polly' Carr, who had previously held the title. Diamond had taken over leadership of a large and expert gang of organised shoplifters. She was a skillful organiser of large expeditions across the West End of London and spread her enterprise to the provinces when London became 'hot'. Her chief lieutenant was volatile and violent Maggie Hill, born Margaret Lily Hill into a criminal north London family that one day would produce Billy Hill, dubbed 'Boss of Britain's Underworld'. Although Diamond, Margaret Hill and other Elephants served prison terms, they believed the risk was worth it - the alternative being a life of poverty. The gang was known for its stylish dress and wild partying. They could 'put on the posh' and take goods valued at hundreds of pounds from prestigious stores by using specialist garments and clever distraction techniques. Their favourite plunder was fur coats and bolts of silk which were expensive commodities between the World Wars. They were known to drive fast cars and could be violent when confronted. Alice Diamond was over five-foot eight-inches in height at a time when the average height for a man was five-foot six-inches. She wore diamond rings on the fingers of both hands and could deliver a punch a man would have envied. Another of the Forty Elephants was Lilian Goldstein, n√©e Kendall, who was also a driver for smash and grab raider Ruby Sparks, tagged by press and police as 'The Bobbed- Haired Bandit'. Personal life Diamond never married, but had a relationship with Bert McDonald, one of the leaders of the Elephant Gang. Maggie Hill married long-term criminal Alfred Hughes. Diamond died at 11 Marnock House, close to 'East Lane' market in Southwark, on 1 April 1952.

After 10 years in the music industry as a rapper and producer, Jayso gained more attention following his work on Sarkodie's second single, Borga, which featured on his debut album, Maakye. Jayso produced over 70 percent of the songs on that album which also shot him into the limelight. Early life During Jayso's teenage years at Presbyterian Boys' Senior High School (PRESEC-Legon) he formed Skillions, a critically acclaimed hip hop musical collective whose works not only served as the foundation and springboard for young artists to venture into hip hop, but also introduced locally brewed hip hop to the larger Ghanaian music community. Prior to this, Jayso joined another rapper producer JPE (now Kobi Onyame) with his friends Canz and Mr. Scratch to form the Haatsville Project. This resulted in the release of the Haatsville Project mixtape, which got a lot of people talking about it within the underground hip hop circuits of Ghana. His current production credits include Sarkodie, M.anifest, Sway, Scientific, Kwaw Kese, Jon Germain, Efya, Rumor and Nigerian MCs Naeto C and Ikechukwu and Gabonese artiste Baponga. On December 10, 2015, he released his debut album titled 'Making Tasha Proud' after over half a decade producing for others. Hammer of the Last Two 3 Early Career/ Music career Jayso's relationship with music began during his childhood years. During Jayso's High School days at (Presec- Legon) he began to hone his skills first as a rapper and music producer. Prior to joining Haatsville, Jayso was rhyming with his pal T-Kube, who left Ghana for the UK in 2002 while in high school. He, together with JPE (now Kobi Onyame), Canz and Mr. Scratch (the Haatsville crew) put out the Haatsville Project tape. The tape received acclaim among hip hop lovers who were mostly the youth. Having built on his production knowledge courtesy of his association with Haatsville, Jayso started recruiting what eventually became the first hip hop group Skillions (Skills in a Million). Enlisting Ball J, Jinx Therapy (now Frank P) as the original members of the Skillions, the likes of EL, Midnight, J-Town, KP and Sandyswiz joined the Skillions family. Under the production supervision of Jayso (who could be described as the Ghanaian version of America's RZA of Skillions) the group released their ground- breaking 21 track debut 'Skillions Demotapes\\" mixtape in 2002. The recording of the mixtape happened entirely within the makeshift bedroom studio of Jayso. That tape gained a lot of success that led to the whole GH-Rap Movement. The success of the mix tape was largely due to the production works and the style of music; they rapped mostly in English interspersed with pidgin (a Ghanaian version of broken English and local dialects) ‚Äì which appealed to a large section of the youth. This eventually cemented Skillions' credentials as one of the talented rap groups of their time in Ghana. Even following the disbandment of the group, each Skillionaire is out making a name for himself within the music and arts scene. The breakup of the Skillions allowed them to pursue solo projects and led to Jayso forming another generation of Skillions. The New Generation comprised Lil Shaker, Rumour, Kevin Beats, Graffik, Killmatic, Padlock, Sandra, Gemini, Nobel and Joey B. The New Generation under the supervision of Jayso released 'The Skillions New Generation Mixtape' with hit songs such as 'Hood', 'Alert', 'Facebook Girl and Boy\\", 'I No Dey Biz' under his Skillion Records Imprint. Jayso has worked with almost every notable artiste within the music sphere in Ghana since 1999. Outside of Ghana, he has worked for one of hip hop legends Wyclef Jean and UK's Sway. Locally, he has produced works for the like of Sarkodie, M.anifest, R2Bees, Efya, Kwaw Kese, Afro Rock Band Dark Suburb, VIP, Reggie Rockstone, ASEM among others.

History On August 4, 2014, then Space Systems/Loral (now SSL) announced that it had been awarded a contract with Intelsat for a new communications satellite. Continuing with a four decades business relationship, Intelsat 36 would be designed to provide media and content distribution services in Africa and South Asia. Its anchor customer would be MultiChoice of South Africa. On July 15, 2016, Senior Space Program Managers Richard Laurie and Brian Sing blogged that they had been on the Boeing factory overseeing the transport preparations for Intelsat 33e to French Guiana. There it would join Intelsat 36, for integration on the Ariane 5 ECA launcher, which was expected to launch on August 24. On July 26, 2016, SSL announced the arrival that same day of Intelsat 36 to the space port in Kourou. At the French launch site, even though Intelsat is the owner of the two passengers of the Ariane 5 VA 232 flight, they have separate launch teams. Each satellite is built by a different manufacturer, and it has a different supervisor team within Intelsat. On August 4, 2016 Program Manager Brian Sing died and the flight was dedicated in his honor. On August 24, 2016, at 22:16:01 UTC, after a slight delay due to a rocket issue, the Ariane 5 ECA VA-232 flight launched from Guiana Space Center ELA-3, with Intelsat 33e riding the upper position and Intelsat 36 enclosed under the SYLDA.

Ruhumuliza trained for the priesthood at Butare Theological School, Rwanda, was ordained a deacon in 1982 and a priest in 1983 and served as curate of Kigeme, Rwanda, until 1984. He then became Manager and Chaplain at Kigeme High School (1983‚Äì1986) before attending Makumira University College (Arusha, Tanzania), graduating with a Bachelor of Divinity (BD) in 1989. He took on the Manager and Chaplain roles at Kigeme Hospital (1989‚Äì1990) then returned to his old High School jobs (1990‚Äì1991). Consecrated in 1991, Ruhumuliza served as Assistant Bishop of Butare until 1992 and as Provincial Secretary for the Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda (1992‚Äì1993). In 1993, he became Assistant Bishop of Kigali and Coadjutor Bishop of Kigali. After the genocide began in April 1994, Ruhumuliza is accused of siding with the Hutu extremist government that organised the genocide of about 800,000 Tutsis. In May 1994, Ruhumuliza wrote to the secretary general of the All Africa Council of Churches, Jose Chipenda, defending the government and blaming the mass killings on its opponents, the Rwandan Patriotic Front. Ruhumuliza wrote that the Rwandan prime minister, Jean Kambanda, and members of his cabinet were touring Rwanda to appeal for unity and peace when in fact they were whipping up the killing https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/15/rwanda-genocide-priest- accomplice-in-england. Kambanda and several members of his cabinet were subsequently convicted of genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwandahttps://unictr.irmct.org/en/cases/ictr-97-23. In June 1994, Ruhumuliza and the Anglican archbishop of Rwanda, Augustin Nshamihigo, held a press conference in Kenya in which they claimed the RPF was leading the massacres and that the government was attempting to stop the killinghttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/15/rwanda-genocide-priest- accomplice-in-england. Human Rights Watch described Ruhumuliza as an apologist for genocide: \\"Far from condemning the attempt to exterminate the Tutsi, Archbishop Augustin Nshamihigo and Bishop Jonathan Ruhumuliza of the Anglican church acted as spokesmen for the genocidal government at a press conference in Nairobi. Like many who tried to explain away the slaughter, they placed the blame for the genocide on the RPF because it had attacked Rwanda. Foreign journalists were so disgusted at this presentation that they left the conference.https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/rwanda0399.htm\\" Nshamihigo's successor as archbishop, Emmanuel Kolini, accused Ruhumuliza of collaborating with the Hutu extremist government and described the Anglican church in Rwanda during the genocide as \\"corrupt\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/06/rwanda-genocide-church- claim-challenged.

Mario Luis Small has greatly contributed to teaching and research at princeton university.  Contributions to sociology  Small has published books and numerous articles on urban poverty, personal networks, and the relationship between qualitative and quantitative social science methods. His books Villa Victoria: The Transformation of Social Capital in a Boston Barrio (2004) and Unanticipated Gains: Origins of Network Inequality in Everyday Life (2009), both received the C. Wright Mills Award for Best Book, among other honors. Small is currently writing a book on the evolution of social support networks among graduate students and studying the formal and informal systems of support among low-income mothers in New York, Chicago, and Huston. He has shown that poor neighborhoods in commonly-studied cities such as Chicago are not representative of ghettos everywhere, that how people understand and make sense of their neighborhood shapes how it affects them, and that local organizations in poor neighborhoods often broker connections to both people and organizations. Small has also demonstrated that people‚Äôs social capital‚Äîincluding how many people they know and how much they trust others‚Äîdepends on the organizations in which they are embedded. His work on methods has shown that many practices used to make qualitative research more scientific are ineffective. Small is currently working to understand why ghettos differ from city to city and how people decide whom to turn to when seeking support.

The Rocky Mountain News described Conley as the founding father of Denver's folk scene, which began in the late 1950s and stretched into the mid 1960s. Conley shared stages with, and opened for, Josh White, Cisco Houston, Mama Cass Elliot, Floyd Red Crow Westerman, and Judy Collins among many others. Conley also opened his home to a young and unknown Bob Dylan in the summer of 1960, and introduced Denver to the little known Smothers Brothers that same year. As the owner of Conley‚Äôs Nostalgia, Walt brought in big name performers such as John Fahey and Dave Van Ronk. To those who worked with him, knew him, and wrote about him, he is referred to as Denver‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrandfather of Folk Music.‚Äù Conley remained an entertainer until he died from a massive stroke at the age of 74. At the time of his death Conley was married to Joan Holden. Conley had four children from previous relationships. Conley's resting place is the Fort Logan National Cemetery in Denver, Colorado. Family and early life Conley (born Billy Robinson) was born in Denver, Colorado. He was raised in Scottsbluff, Nebraska by adoptive parents who gave him the name Walter Bell Conley. After his father died, Walt and his mother moved to Denver where he attended Manual High School and eventually received a football scholarship to Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, Colorado. During summer breaks as a student, Conley worked at a ranch in San Cristobal, New Mexico, owned by Jenny and Craig Vincent. Jenny Vincent was a respected folk-singer who performed with such luminaries as Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Malvina Reynolds, and Earl Robinson. It was during one of those summers at the ranch that Conley met Pete Seeger and other members of The Weavers, a popular ‚Äô50s folk group. It was Pete Seeger who assisted Walt in buying his first guitar, convincing Conley to use his rich baritone to perform as a folk singer. Shortly after college, Conley enlisted in the Navy during the Korean War conflict. After he was discharged, Conley joined a film crew shooting the 1954 film Salt of the Earth. Conley then attended the University of Northern Colorado, then known as the Colorado State College of Education, where he majored in Theater and Physical Education. After graduating Conley had a brief career in teaching until this position clashed with his ambitions as an entertainer. Musician: the late 1950s and 1960s Conley‚Äôs first professional folk singing job was at the Windsor Hotel in Denver playing calypso songs. The hotel contained three bars and Conley was often booked in all three bars on the same night. He would sing a few songs in one, then rush upstairs to play another bar, and then rush to the third bar. Conley‚Äôs next job was at a premiere folk venue in Denver called Little Bohemia. There he met a young folk musician and Denver native named Judy Collins. Collins was also playing at another folk venue in Boulder, Colorado, called Michael‚Äôs Pub, and soon Conley added this venue to his list of places to perform. In 1959 a Denver businessman with a passion for folk music named Hal Neustaedter opened a folk venue called Exodus, which brought in headline acts such as Josh White, Bob Gibson, The Terriers, Jimmy Driftwood, and many others. Neustaedter asked Conley to be the opening act for six months of the year. Judy Collins was booked as opening act for the other six months. During this time, Conley also spent a lot of time in Aspen, Colorado, where the folk scene was vibrant with new groups such as The Limeliters. It was in Aspen that Conley met the Smothers Brothers who he booked while managing the Satire Club in Denver that same year. This was the Smothers Brothers first appearance in Denver. It was also while managing the Satire that Conley was approached by a young unknown named Bob Dylan who had left Minnesota to try find a place for himself in Denver‚Äôs growing folk community. Conley allowed Dylan to open for the Smothers Brothers for a brief period of time before Dylan made his way back to Minnesota. Conley eventually gave up his job at the Satire and returned to performing exclusively at the Exodus. Hollywood actor: the 1970s As the folk music scene in Denver, and the United States, began to fade, Conley left Denver for Hollywood in the early '70s to try his hand at acting. He was offered minor roles in some popular TV shows of that time such as Get Christy Love!, The Rockford Files, and The Six Million Dollar Man where Conley played Dr. Lomax. Conley also appeared in feature films, such as Prison for Children, and made a living doing voice-overs for TV commercials and films, including The Longest Yard, for which he supplied all the grunts and groans during a rough football game. He also read the Indian Lord's Prayer that aired when Denver TV stations signed off at night, in a ritual that prompted a letter of praise from President Nixon. Throughout his years as an actor Conley also continued to perform folk songs in Pasadena, Chicago, and in Denver. Conley's Nostalgia: the 1980s In 1983, Conley returned to Denver to open his own club. He named it Conley's Nostalgia and it became a magnet for folk musicians in Denver. Conley booked national talent such as Bob Gibson, Dave Van Ronk, and John Fahey, along with local talent. Conley regularly booked the Denver group Juice O'The Barley at the club. Juice O'The Barley played Celtic music, and Conley found himself increasingly drawn to the genre and developed a passion for performing Irish folk music himself. Conley & Company: the 1990s With its engaging rhythm and politically nuanced messages Irish music reminded Conley of the folk singers he idolized such as Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, Merle Travis, and Doc Watson. By 1995, when Conley celebrated 35 years as a professional musician by holding a fundraiser for the Rocky Mountain Music Association, he was performing mostly Irish music. Conley then formed the Irish pub band Conley & Company, which consisted of an assortment of local musicians that would accompany Conley during performances. Conley continued to do solo performances as well and remained an entertainer until he died from a massive stroke at the age of 74. The band Conley & Company continued on as Juice o'the Barley after he passed away. Conley's resting place is the Fort Logan National Cemetery in Denver, Colorado.

In 1864 he was appointed lecturer in Mineralogy and Geology at Pavia, where from 1874 he held the professorship of Zoology and Comparative anatomy.

She also performed on Late Night with David Letterman, singing back-up for R&B; singer Ne-Yo, sang in a 2012 commercial for the 100th anniversary of American Express, and was featured on NY-1 News, with \\"Where in The Truck is Chloe.\\" =Later music career= She continued writing music, saying: \\"I locked myself in a room and wrote songs ‚Äî it was an escape from thinking about my condition. There's a new level of sincerity and truth that didn't come from me before.\\" She also observed, \\"There was a part of me that wanted to rush to write songs because I didn't know how much time I had left.\\" In 2014, The Huffington Post described Temtchine as \\"clearly still a superb song stylist.\\" Her 2015 album, Be Brave, was described by the New York Post as \\"a moving collection of pop songs that document her struggle for survival, but also her recovery.\\" Toby Gad was a producer of the album.\\"Chloe Temtchine ‚Äì In Time Music, Inc.,\\" tobygad.com Temtchine recalled that one of the mix engineers got excited about a song on the album titled \\"Loving you,\\" because it is a love song, and he said \\"he knew I was getting better because it wasn't about surviving!\\" Temtchine wrote the song \\"Be Brave\\" shortly after she was released from the hospital's critical care unit. Over 150,000 copies were downloaded within the first 90 days of its release. Amy Carlberg opined in Bust Magazine that : > The song is twangy and energetic, and springboards off the bluegrass and > banjo-laden sounds that have been ruling the pop charts.

Temtchine continues to write, and as of July 2016 she was working on a new album, tentatively titled Someday. Personal life =Health issues= Temtchine was plagued with a series of medical symptoms, starting in 2008. They included shortness of breath, and onstage coughing fits. Doctors could not determine the cause of her ailments. She recalled with a laugh, \\"At one point, I was even told to seek psychiatric help.\\" In February 2013, Temtchine was rushed to the hospital with congestive heart failure in her right heart, unable to breathe and barely alive. She was diagnosed with a rare disorder, pulmonary venoocclusive disease (PVOD), which accounts for a small number of pulmonary hypertension cases (fewer than 200 cases are diagnosed a year), as well as severe pulmonary hypertension.\\"The Singer who can't Breathe,\\", Chasing News, July 29, 2016 It manifests as a constantly high level of blood pressure in the heart's arteries, leading to inflammation and enlargement of the heart. Without treatment, sufferers are expected to live an average of 2.5 years. Temtchine's heart was three times the normal size. Her echocardiogram revealed a mean right ventricular pulmonary pressure of 180, significantly higher than the normal mean pressure of 25 or less. Initially, she was told that she only had days left to live. She was given a slim chance of recovery. Temtchine altered her life. She adopted a strictly raw vegan diet, and exercises regularly in small bursts. Temtchine is also required to bring an oxygen tank with her everywhere she goes, which is connected to a breathing tube in her nose, and stay connected to the tank 24 hours a day. She admits it can be annoying and frustrating. She performs onstage while connected to the oxygen tank. Temtchine said people can react to it very strangely, and that once someone mistook it for a vacuum cleaner. Temtchine named her oxygen tank \\"Steve Martin\\", after the comedian, saying \\"I thought it fit\\". She often dresses it up ‚Äì sometimes \\"Steve Martin\\" wears a wig, or a tie. She said: \\"A couple of years ago, I was at a Vanity Fair party and I met the real Steve Martin. He said he was honored to be named after a tank!\\" Temtchine's prognosis is uncertain. She states that she does not experience as many difficulties singing or performing onstage now that she has the right treatment and the tank. She observed: \\"Nobody has any idea what's going on, but we're hopeful because everything is going in the right direction!\\"  References  External links *chloetemtchine.com, Chloe Temtchine website *\\"Chloe Temtchine  Album Discography,\\" AllMusic.com * *\\"Interview with Chloe Temtchine,\\" High Notes, Caring Voice Coalition, March 2014 *\\"It Happened to Me: I'm a Singer-Songwriter, and I Perform with an Oxygen Tank,\\" by Chloe Temtchine, xojane.com, April 22, 2014 Berklee College of Music alumni American jazz singers American soul singers Living people American female singer-songwriters American singer- songwriters American pop singers Singers from New York City Hypertension 1980s births Jazz musicians from New York (state) 21st-century American singers 21st-century American women singers ","title":"Chloe Temtchine"},{"id":"51417652","text":"International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases is an indexed peer reviewed English language Rheumatology Journal and the official publication of APLAR.

Callers are also still allowed to preserve their anonymity by choosing to block all outgoing caller ID information on their phone lines. Under the act, which also targets caller ID spoofing on VOIP services, it is illegal \\"to cause any caller identification service to knowingly transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information with the intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value....\\" Forfeiture penalties or criminal fines of up to $10,000 per violation (not to exceed $1,000,000) could be imposed.http://www.nysba.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&CONTENTID;=46713&TEMPLATE;=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm#_ftn2 \\"Don't Believe Your Eyes: Spoofing\\" The law maintains an exemption for blocking one's own outgoing caller ID information, and the government itself isn't affected. Legislative history of Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 A detailed discussion of the legislative process that gave rise to the applicable law now follows. On April 6, 2006, Congressmen Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Joe Barton (R-Tex.) introduced H.R. 5126, a bill that would have made caller ID spoofing a crime. Dubbed the \\"Truth in Caller ID Act of 2006\\", the bill would have outlawed causing \\"any caller identification service to transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information\\" via \\"any telecommunications service or IP-enabled voice service.\\" Law enforcement was exempted from the rule. Three weeks later, an identical bill was introduced in the Senate. On June 6, 2006, the House of Representatives passed the Truth in Caller ID Act, although no Senate action was taken on either the House or Senate bill. At the end of the 109th Congress, the bill expired (all pending legislation not voted into law at the end of the House term, a.k.a. end of a session of Congress, is dead). On January 5, 2007, Congressman Engel introduced H.R. 251, and Senator Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) introduced a similar bill (S.704) two months later. On June 27, 2007, the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation approved and submitted to the Senate calendar S.704, a bill that would have made caller ID spoofing a crime.

Sandford. Born a slave, Robinson Scott traveled from the east coast to the rugged Northwest Territories of modern-day Minnesota, before settling in St Louis Missouri. After years of effort, Robinson Scott finally attained her freedom in 1857, survived the Civil War and lived out her days in the company of her two daughters and grandchildren.  Early life  Harriet Robinson Scott was born around 1815 as a slave. As a girl, she was trained as a laundress by her mother, who worked as a slave at an inn. Robinson Scott was never taught to read, and remained illiterate throughout her life. By the time Robinson Scott was a teenager, Lawrence Taliaferro, a federal Indian agent, was her owner. While the historical record is unclear, some scholarship suggests that Robinson Scott originated with the Pennsylvania-based family of Taliaferro's wife, Elizabeth Dillon, and was given as a wedding gift to the couple in 1828. However, others believe she originated in Virginia. In 1835, Taliaferro was assigned to Fort Snelling, a military post and fur-trading outpost located in present-day Minnesota. Robinson Scott accompanied her owner, and was kept as a house slave, serving the Taliaferro household. Although it violated the Missouri Compromise of 1820, slaves were not uncommon at the newly-built fort and throughout the Northwest Territory. Both local fur traders and military officers held slaves, including Colonel Josiah Snelling himself, with an estimated 30 or more enslaved people living at the fort around the time Robinson Scott moved there. The existence of enslaved people in a region where slavery was legally prohibited occurred in part because military men transferred between slave- owning and free areas. Military officers received an allowance to maintain a servant, however it was not specified that the servant be a free person. Whether they paid their servant a salary or not, they were still allowed to keep the maintenance money. These economic incentives encouraged military officers to supplement their pay by keeping a slave instead of employing a free person. Robinson Scott's owner held additional slaves besides Robinson Scott, usually around 2-3 at a time. Records show Taliaferro had about 21 slaves over the course of his life, although in his own note-keeping, he referred to them as \\"servants\\". While slavery was tacitly, if not legally, allowed at the fort, there were examples during this period of enslaved people associated with Fort Snelling becoming free. Sometimes, officers who procured a slave to maintain a household while serving at the fort would free the slave once they returned to their homes in the northeast. Robinson Scott's time at the fort may have overlapped with another slave, Rachel, who would go on to successfully sue for freedom in the mid-1830s.  Marriage to Dred Scott  Robinson Scott lived among and worked within a diverse community. Fort Snelling was a frontier area, where white military men, enslaved and free African-Americans, Native Americans, fur traders and mixed-race people lived in the community. Dakota and Ojibwe tribe members were the largest demographic and racial dynamics were somewhat more fluid than in other areas, in part because there was no cash-crop economy dependent on slave labor. Winters were very harsh, necessitating close quarters, so there were fewer boundaries between people of different races and classes. While there, Robinson Scott met her future husband, Dred Scott. Scott was a personal slave to Dr. John Emerson who was a military surgeon. Although an enslaved person, Scott was also able to hire himself out and earned some independent income. Harriet Robinson married Dred Scott in 1836 when she was in her late teens or early twenties and he was about 15 years older. It was a second marriage for Scott. The marriage between the two slaves was particularly notable at the time because an actual civil ceremony took place, officiated over by Robinson Scott's owner, Taliaferro, a justice of the peace. Slave marriages were not recognized as valid at the time for several reasons, including that slaves were generally not allowed to enter into contracts, and the fear that they could then claim additional rights that would undermine the property rights of their owners. The fact that an official ceremony took place ended up being an important point in the subsequent trial, because it suggested that both Emerson and Taliaferro might have recognized the Scotts as free people at the time of their marriage. According to an interview Taliaferro gave around 1864, he was responsible for \\"marrying the two and giving the girl her freedom.\\" Whether this was really the case is unclear, and others believe that Robinson Scott was sold to Emerson, however no record of a sale has ever been found. Since the Scotts continued to work for, and be hired out by, Emerson following their marriage, they did not live as free people.  Life in slavery  Restored living quarters at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. Originally known as Fort Saint Anthony, this historic fort is now part of the National Park Service. It is thought that the Scott family shared this room for approximately four years in the latter half of the 1830s while working for John Emerson, an army surgeon stationed there. John Emerson was transferred to Fort Jesup in Louisiana by November, 1837. There, he met and married Eliza Irene Sanford in February, 1838. Shortly thereafter, he sent for the Scotts to join them. In April, 1838, Robinson Scott, pregnant with her first child, and her husband traveled to Louisiana, a slave-holding state. By September, Emerson was transferred back to Fort Snelling. By this point, Robinson Scott was heavily pregnant. She gave birth aboard the Gypsey, traveling north on the Mississippi river. The Gypsey was little more than a tug boat, and the Scotts were quartered in the bowels of the ship, near the furnace. Robinson Scott bore a baby girl, named Eliza, north of the Missouri line. This would become an additional point in their subsequent legal argument for freedom. At one point, Emerson became embroiled in a dispute with the Fort Snelling quartermaster, who refused to provide a second stove for the Scott family to use. Emerson obtained the second stove after threatening to fight the man. In 1840, Emerson was transferred to Florida, and left his wife and the Scott family in St Louis, Missouri. They stayed with Irene Emerson's father, Alexander Sanford, on his plantation California. Sanford owned an additional four slaves. The Scotts were hired out to work for others in the surrounding area. After Emerson was discharged from the army in 1842, he moved with his wife onto some land he owned in Iowa. Emerson did not live long, dying in 1843 from consumption (tuberculosis). It is unclear whether Robinson Scott lived in Iowa or remained in St Louis. Meanwhile, Robinson Scott gave birth to another girl, named Lizzie. Lizzie was born in the slave-state of Missouri. At some point during this period, she also bore two sons, who both died as babies. After Emerson's death, Irene Emerson moved back to her father's home in St Louis, then east to Massachusetts. She left the Scotts in Missouri under the supervision of her brother-in-law, Captain Henry Bainbridge, during this period. The Scotts continued to live in St Louis through the mid-1840s, hired out to various employers, including a grocery store. In 1846, Dred Scott worked as a valet, accompanying soldiers to Texas during the Mexican-American War.  The case  main article: Dred Scott v. Sandford Sometime during 1846, Dred Scott offered Irene Emerson $300 in exchange for his family's freedom, but the offer was refused. Lea VanderVelde, author of Mrs Robinson Scott, suggested that Irene Emerson's refusal to free the Scott family and the amount of effort she put into defending her ownership claim in the subsequent trial may have hinged on several calculations. Scott, approaching his mid-fifties, suffering from tuberculosis and no longer able to work as much, would not have been considered a particularly valuable asset any longer. However, Missouri law at the time financially penalized slave-owners who freed old, infirm or very young slaves to fend for themselves. Emerson may have feared paying these penalties. In contrast, Robinson Scott, who was much younger and healthier than her husband, and her two daughters, were considered valuable property. Emerson may have felt the combined financial loss would not outweigh the $300 sum. Page from the majority opinion in the 1857 Supreme Court decision Dred Scott v. Sandford, which overturned the Missouri Compromise of 1820, and determined that Harriet Robinson Scott and her family had no rights and should remain as slaves. Around the time of the lawsuit, Emerson had largely left the Scott's to fend for themselves. Scott marshaled some support from his former owners, the Blow family, while Robinson Scott became associated with a local church. Emerson's lack of oversight during this time became an issue during the lawsuit when the Scotts had difficulty proving that Emerson was, in fact, their owner. Robinson Scott's membership at the Second African Baptist church in St Louis provided the connection to the Scott's first lawyer, Francis Murdoch, a fellow church-member. Murdoch had lived in Bedford, Pennsylvania, around the same time as Robinson Scott's previous owner, Taliaferro, and frequented the same circles. He was familiar with Pennsylvania law. Legal scholars Leah VanderVelde and Sandhya Subramanian suggest that the timing and impetus for the initial case may have hinged on Robinson Scott's origination in Pennsylvania and age at the time, 28 years old. According to Pennsylvania law (An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery), which Murdoch would have been familiar with, Pennsylvania-based slaves would be freed at the age of 28. An additional motivation for the timing of the lawsuit may have been the death of John Emerson, and the fear that, as their two daughters grew older, Irene Emerson would sell some or all of the family and split them apart. Dred Scott and Harriet Robinson Scott separately filed suits for freedom in 1846. Harriet Scott v. Irene Emerson was billeted as the second case for the November court proceedings in St Louis, Missouri, behind her husband's case, Dred Scott v. Irene Emerson. Both Harriet and Dred filed their own petitions and relied on their lawyer, Francis Murdoch, and the minister of the African Baptist church they attended, John R. Anderson, due to illiteracy. The case hinged in part on the \\"once free, always free\\" doctrine, which had been established in Missouri court in some prior cases where slaves had successfully sued for freedom. These legal precedents supported the idea that slaves brought to a free state, especially if they lived there for a period of time, could not be re-enslaved. According to Robinson Scott's great-great granddaughter, Lynne Jackson, filing a separate suit from her husband was important to Robinson Scott, noting \\"she did that because, as a woman and as the mother, if for any reason Dred did not win his case but she did, then their daughters would be free. There was a little strategy there. And it was courageous.\\" During the trial and subsequent appeals, Robinson Scott lived at times under the supervision of the St. Louis county sheriff with her husband, and continued working, while the sheriff held onto their pay. However, Robinson Scott's two young daughters remained at large, as the St. Louis Daily Evening News reported after the trial in May, 1857: > \\"[Dred's] daughters, Eliza and Jane [sic], were, virtually, free before, > having achieved their freedom by their heels what the more conscientious > Dred could not secure by ten years of litigation. Their whereabouts have > been kept a secret, though no effort has been, and none probably would have > been, made to recover them. Their father knew where they were, and could > bring them back at any moment. He will doubtless recall them now.\\" The Scott's first lawyer, Murdoch, moved to California before the initial lawsuits could reach trial, leaving them without legal representation. The Blow family assisted the Scotts: their second lawyer was Charles Drake, son- in-law to Dred Scott's former owner, Peter Blow. In 1847, the initial lawsuits were dismissed because the Scotts were not able to prove that Irene Emerson was actually their owner, however the case was re-filed and they were able to establish ownership. The Scott family was granted their freedom on January 12, 1850 by a St Louis jury. However, Emerson appealed their case and the court combined the two petitions into one, creating the case Dred Scott vs. Irene Emerson to decide the whole family's fate. In 1852, the Missouri Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, re-enslaving the Scotts. In 1853, the Scotts appealed the case. Emerson transferred responsibility for the Scotts to her brother, John Sanford (incorrectly spelled Sandford on some court documents), hence the final case was known as Dred Scott v. Sandford. Sanford appeared to have strong opinions about the Scott family. He called them \\"worthless and insolent\\" and physically attacked Robinson Scott and her two daughters in 1853, at one point imprisoning them in a barn. Five years later on March 6, 1857, after the case had moved through the United States Supreme Court, the court famously decided the Scott family should remain slaves. The decision hinged on Chief Justice Roger B. Taney's opinion overturning the Missouri Compromise, which had prohibited slavery in certain states. In his opinion, Taney wrote of the assertion that \\"all men are created equal\\" in the Declaration of Independence: \\"it is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this declaration.\\" Some modern legal scholars question the wisdom of combining Harriet Robinson Scott's case with her husband's, noting that several details of her life meant she had the stronger claim to freedom, and a positive result would have freed not only Robinson Scott, but also her two daughters (since slave status flowed from the mother). Potential legal avenues Robinson Scott might have had available to her that did no apply to her husband included her origins in Pennsylvania, a free state with laws requiring manumission of enslaved people at age 28 and the possibility that her former owner, Taliaferro, intended to free her when he officiated her marriage to Scott.  Life after the trial  Reporters were interested in the Scott family following the famous trial. Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper featured an interview and the engravings of the family on their front page on June 27, 1857. The images are based on daguerreotypes taken of the family in a photography studio. Although Robinson Scott lost her case for freedom, she did not remain a slave for long. Irene Emerson, the owner who had fought to keep her enslaved, had since re-married and moved to Massachusetts. Her new husband, Dr. Calvin Clifford Chaffee was a congressman and publicly against slavery. Although Emerson had transferred control of the Scotts to her brother, John Sanford, she remained the legal owner. Chaffee claimed to be unaware that his wife owned some of the most well-known slaves of the era until just before the final decision in the case was handed down. Exposed to censure as a hypocrite, Chaffee asked that ownership of the Scotts be transferred to Taylor Blow. Only a citizen of Missouri could transfer ownership, leaving the decision to his wife. She complied, but demanded, and received, the $750 in wages earned by the Scotts and held by the sheriff over the past years while the trial was ongoing. On May 26, 1857, the Scotts were officially freed. In the months following the trial, the Scott family had visits from some reporters, looking to learn more about the people behind the famous court case. Some reporters attempted to convince Dred Scott to tour the country, promising he could make $1000 or more. Robinson Scott was protective of her husband, asking that white men leave her husband alone, and insisting there would be no tour. In part, Robinson Scott was afraid of additional scrutiny and the possibility that she or her family could be kidnapped back into slavery. Robinson Scott did agree to having a daguerreotype made of the couple and her children, on the condition that she would get to keep a copy. Robinson Scott's husband lived only a short time after freedom, dying of tuberculosis in 1858. Robinson Scott continued supporting the family as a laundress, saying in the vernacular of the day that ‚Äúshe‚Äôd always been able to yarn her own livin, thank God.‚Äù Robinson Scott lived in St Louis for the remainder of her life. She was listed in the St Louis directory from 1859 to 1876. In the 1860 census she is listed as living in her own home, though by 1870 she was a live-in domestic servant. She died on June 17, 1876, having lived through the Civil War and the emancipation of the slaves.  Descendants and legacy  Portrait of Eliza and Lizzie Scott. Robinson Scott's two daughters, Eliza and Lizzie, went on to live as free black women. Older daughter Eliza married Wilson Madison. While she had up to seven children, only two sons survived to adulthood. Lizzie did not marry, and lived an obscure existence for much of her adult life. She disguised her identity by taking on an assumed name, Lizzie Marshall. She lived to be nearly 100 years old, dying in 1945. She worked as a cleaner for a boarding house and also helped take care of her nephews. Memorial to Dred and Harriet Scott outside the old St Louis courthouse. Robinson Scott has living descendants who remain in Missouri. Lynne Jackson, a great-great granddaughter of the Scotts founded the Dred Scott Heritage Foundation to promote the historical legacy of the Scotts and encourage racial reconciliation. Some contemporary accounts of Robinson Scott's husband described him favorably. A former governor of Missouri said at the time that \\"Scott was a very much respected Negro.\\" In 1857, a St Louis newspaper described Scott as \\"illiterate but not ignorant,\\" with a \\"strong common sense.\\" Following the case and in the ensuing decades, a negative portrait of the Scott family was advanced in some quarters. In a biography of John Emerson, written in 1938 by Charles Snyder, the author quotes a 1929 article by John Hodder stating \\"apparently Scott was one of the most shiftless and lazy members of his race. Mrs. Emerson had no use for him, so she allowed him to remain as a hanger-on at the army post and to shift for himself.\\" Snyder proposed that Irene Emerson resisted freeing the Scotts, not because she wished to keep them as slaves, but only because she felt she legally could not free them given the terms of her husband's will. However, in recent years, both Dred and Harriet Scott have received more attention and recognition for their role in the court case and fight for freedom. A re- evaluation of Dred Scott's personal qualities occurred. The role and agency of Robinson Scott in the case has received additional attention. Robinson Scott was buried in an unmarked grave in the Black-only Greenwood Cemetery in St Louis. Her grave remained forgotten until it was re-discovered in 2006 by Etta Daniels of the Greenwood Cemetery Preservation Association. The cemetery was neglected for a time, but by the early 2000's efforts were made to reclaim the lost graves. Volunteers raised funds to place a marker and memorialize Robinson Scott's final resting place. In recent years, descendants of Robinson Scott met with those of Judge Taney to receive a public apology, which was accepted. The combined group has worked together to determine what should happen to memorial statues of Taney.

Its heyday was during the early part of the Twentieth century. History In the early 1870s, the forest on the shores of Chaleur Bay were seen to be receding. A group of Bathurst townspeople involved in the lumber trade imagined that the area around Tracadie could serve to feed their industry if only a suitable form of transport could be arranged. Thus was born the Caraquet Railway Company on 18 April 1874. The first contracts were not let until a decade later. On 7 August 1884, the sod-turning for the Caraquet Railway occurred, with luminaries like Kennedy Francis Burns in attendance. On 30 June 1885 the first section from Bathurst to Stonehaven was completed. Two years later approximately 30 km of rail had been laid. It was completed by 1890, but not before controversy exploded into public view. In 1889 there was a major scandal when the shareholders accused Burns of fraudulent schemes and false representation in regard to the construction and the issuing of shares. He was exposed in Parliament by Edward Blake. Throughout his career as a businessman, Burns mainly used Acadian workers, paid with due-bills, which could be exchanged only at the company store. He was supported in this artifice by catholic Bishop James Rogers. Burns was the beneficiary of governmental largesse in the form of railroad subsidies and cutting licences for timber on New Brunswick crown lands. In 1908 were listed 23 stops, such as Stonehaven, Grande-Anse, Burnsville and Caraquet along the line from Bathurst to Shippagan. On 13 April 1911, the Caraquet Railway Company merged with the Gulf Shore Company, which had opened for business in July 1897 and connected Pokemouche Junction with Sheila. With the merger came a new name, and the Caraquet and Gulf Shore Railway was born. In May 1918, the Dominion government offered $200,000 to purchase the railway, but the owners were somewhat reluctant because the capital invested to date was on the order of ten times that sum. But the C&GS; had been built by government programmes, so the Minister of Public Works could be firm: The C&GS; was absorbed by the newly- minted Canada Northern Crown corporation on 1 June 1920 for the original offer. A brakeman who joined the company in 1919 remembered the C&GS; as a slow-moving mixed train of people, livestock and freight that stopped anywhere and everywhere. McCarthy (1997) relates a tale of how, during the great blizzard of 1935, men were employed at a rate of $2 a day to clear a path in the snow down to the rails. A map dated 1987 shows the CN rail line still in existence.

He founded the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, and in the late 1990s brokered a historic production cut between OPEC and its rivals in the wake of a slump in the price of oil. Early life and education Mabro was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in December 1934, the son of Greek Orthodox parents who had migrated from Tripoli, Lebanon in the 1860s. He graduated with a BSc in Engineering from Alexandria University in 1956, after which he worked as a civil engineer in Egypt for a number of years. In 1960 he joined a Jesuit seminary near Paris and spent the next four years studying philosophy; he then went to London to study economics as a post-graduate student at the School of Oriental & African Studies. He took his MSc in 1966, and then became a researcher in economics at SOAS, where he met Judy, whom he married in 1967. Career In 1971, Mabro was made a Fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford. Throughout the 1970s, Mabro's interest in oil- and energy-related matters grew, and he wrote his first monograph on the subject - \\"Oil Producers and Consumers: Conflict or Cooperation\\" - in 1974. He founded the Oxford Energy Policy Club in 1976; the club continues to meet biannually and gives oil industry executives and senior government officials from around the world the opportunity to hold informal, off-the- record talks. He set up the Oxford Energy Seminar, which has been held annually since 1979 and is widely recognised as an important international forum on energy. In 1982, Mabro founded the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, an educational charity devoted to researching the economics, politics and impact on international relations of oil, gas and other energies. He served as the institute's Director until 2003, and was made its Honorary President in 2006. In the 1995 New Year Honours Mabro was appointed a CBE. He was elected a Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford in 2006. He is widely held in libraries worldwide. He died on Crete, Greece, on 2 August 2016. 1997 oil production cut In the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, oil prices plunged sharply to below $10 a barrel, which had significant negative effects on the economies of crude oil producers around the world. However, a history of distrust and a desire to protect their own market share was preventing any cooperation to counter the price fall amongst the nations affected. In early 1998, following a meeting in Oxford with Adrian Lajous, the head of Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex, Mabro held a series of meetings and phone calls in which he acted as an intermediary between officials from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and their Mexican rivals. This initiative led to joint production cuts in late 1998 and early 1999, the effect of which was that by mid-2000 the price of crude oil had recovered to more than $30 a barrel. Lajous later recalled, \\"Robert Mabro played a key, if unaccredited, role in the secret negotiations that brought together these three countries.\\" Mabro himself later suggested that OPEC should change its logo to a tea-bag ‚Äúbecause it only works in hot water.‚Äù Publications * The Egyptian Economy, 1952-72 (1974) * The Industrialization of Egypt, 1939-73: Policy and Performance (co-author, 1976) * World Energy Issues and Politics (1980) * The Market for North Sea Crude Oil (co-author, 1986) * Oil Markets and Prices: The Brent Market and the Formation of World Oil Prices (co-author, 1993) * Energy Taxation and Economic Growth (co-author, 1994) * The Oil Price Crisis of 1998 (1998) * Gas to Europe: The Strategies of Four Major Suppliers (co-author, 1999) * Oil in the Twenty-First Century: Issues, Challenges, and Opportunities (2006) * Oil Markets and Prices: The Brent Market and the Formation of World Oil Prices (co-author) References 1934 births 2016 deaths Greek academics Alexandria University alumni Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Egyptian emigrants to Greece Alumni of SOAS University of London Fellows of St Antony's College, Oxford Fellows of St Catherine's College, Oxford ","title":"Robert Mabro"},{"id":"51417871","text":"Justice George may refer to: *James Z.

These VANTAs effectively preserve and often accentuate the unique anisotropic properties of individual carbon nanotubes and possess a morphology that may be precisely controlled. VANTAs are consequently widely useful in a range of current and potential device applications.  Synthesis  There are a handful of experimental technologies available to align a single or an array of CNTs along a pre-determined orientation. The techniques rely on different mechanisms and therefore are applicable to different situations. These techniques are categorized into two groups pertaining to when the alignment is achieved: (a) in-situ techniques where alignment is achieved during the CNT growth process and (b) ex-situ techniques where CNTs are originally grown in random orientations and alignment is achieved afterwards such as during the device integration process. = Thermal chemical vapor deposition =  Growth mechanism  Thermal chemical vapor deposition is a common technique to grow aligned arrays of CNTs. In the CVD process, a hot carbonaceous gas decomposes, *leaving carbon diffuses into or around the catalyst particles*, and then nucleates a graphitic nanotube sidewall at one crystallographic face of the catalyst. The catalyst diameter directly controls the diameter of the nanotubes that are grown. There are two primary growth models for the CVD growth of VANTAs: ‚Äútip-growth model‚Äù and the ‚Äúbase-growth model.‚Äù In the case of the tip-growth model, hydrocarbon decomposes on the top surface of the metal, carbon diffuses down through the metal, and CNT precipitates out across the metal bottom, pushing the whole metal particle off the substrate, and continues to grow until the metal is fully covered with excess carbon and its catalytic activity ceases. In the case of the base-growth model, the initial hydrocarbon decomposition and carbon diffusion take place similar to that in the tip-growth case, but the CNT precipitation emerges out from the metal particle‚Äôs apex and forms a hemispherical dome, which then extends up in the form of seamless graphitic cylinder. Subsequent hydrocarbon decomposition takes place on the lower peripheral surface of the metal, and as-dissolved carbon diffuses upward. Most thermal CVD processes grow nanotubes by the root or base growth method. The morphology of both the individual CNTs and the CNT array is dictated by various CVD growth parameters, which may be tuned to yield vertically aligned arrays of CNTs with various structures.  Catalyst  The catalyst enables the pyrolysis of carbon and subsequent growth of VANTA. Catalysts are typically metals that have high carbon solubility at high temperatures and that exhibit a high carbon diffusion rate, such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Other transition metals such as copper (Cu), gold (Au), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt), and palladium (Pd) are also reported to catalyze CNT growth from various hydrocarbons but have lower carbon solubility and consequently lower growth rates. Solid organometallocenes such as ferrocene, cobaltocene, nickelocene are also common catalysts. It is found that the temperature and time of the thermal and reduction catalyst pre-treatment steps are crucial variables for optimized nanoparticle distribution with different average diameters, depending on the initial film thickness. For CNT growth by CVD, a sputtered thin film of catalyst (e.g. 1 nm of Fe) is applied. During heating, the film de-wets, creating islands of iron that then nucleate nanotubes. As the iron is mobile, islands can merge if left too long at the growth temperature before initiating nanotube growth. Annealing at the growth temperature reduces the site density #/mm2 and increases the diameter of the nanotubes. As the nanotubes grow from the catalyst islands, the crowding effects and van der Waals forces between other CNTs leave them no choice to grow in any direction but vertically to the substrate. The height of vertically aligned CNTs varies with catalyst particle spacing as well. Reports have indicated that for vertically aligned arrays of CNT bundles, the CNTs grow longer when there are other CNTs growing near them, indicated by longer CNTs grown on larger catalyst particles or when catalyst particles are spaced close together. Choi et al. reported good morphology and dense distribution of VANTAs grown from Ni nano powders and magnetic fluids mixed in polyvinyl alcohol spin-coated on Si and alumina. Xiong et al. demonstrated that single crystal magnesium oxide (MgO) is a capable substrate for growing VANTAs as long as 2.2 mm when catalyzed with a Fe catalyst. It has also been demonstrated that applying a monolayer of Mo with a Co catalyst suppressed the broadening of the SWNT diameter distribution in the as-grown VANTA, while both the composition and amount of Co and Mo affected the catalytic activity.  Support  The substrate material, its surface morphology and textural properties greatly affect the resulting VANTA yield. Some examples of commonly used substrates in CVD are quartz, silicon, silicon carbide, silica, alumina, zeolite, CaCO3, and magnesium oxide. Most substrates are coated with an underlayer consisting of 10-20 nm of alumina before depositing the catalyst. This regularizes the dewetting of the catalyst into islands of predictable size, and is a diffusion barrier between the substrate and the metal catalyst. Li et al. have produced VANTA consisting of Y- shaped carbon nanotubes by the pyrolysis of methane over cobalt- covered magnesium oxide catalyst on branched nanochannel alumina templates. Qu et al. used a pitch-based carbon fiber as a support for the growth of VANTA using a FePc carbon source. The resulting array propagates radially on the surface of the carbon fiber. Zhong, et al. demonstrated the direct growth of VANTAs on metallic titanium (Ti) coatings with a Fe/Ti/Fe catalyst sputtered on SiO2/Si wafers. Alvarez et al. reports the ability to spin-coat an alumoxane solution as a catalyst support for VANTA growths via CVD. After a conventional Fe catalyst was evaporated onto the spin-coated support, the resulting VANTA growth yield was similar to conventional Al2O3 powder supports.  Carbon source  The carbon source for the CVD of VANTAs is most commonly a carbon gas such as methane, ethylene, acetylene, benzene, xylene, or carbon monoxide. Other examples of carbon precursors include cyclohexane, fullerene, methanol, and ethanol. The pyrolysis of these gases into carbon atoms varies based on the decomposition rate at growth temperatures, the carbon content of the gas molecules, and the growth catalyst. Linear hydrocarbons such as methane, ethylene, acetylene, thermally decompose into atomic carbons or linear dimers/trimers of carbon, and generally produce straight and hollow CNTs. On the other hand, cyclic hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylene, cyclohexane, fullerene, produce relatively curved/hunched CNTs with the tube walls often bridged inside. Aligned arrays of MWNTs have been synthesized through the catalytic decomposition of ferrocene-xylene precursor mixture onto quartz substrates at atmospheric pressure and relatively low temperature (~675 ¬∞C). Eres et al. found that the addition of ferrocene into the gas stream by thermal evaporation concurrently with acetylene enhanced carbon nanotube growth rates and extend the VANTA thickness to 3.25 mm. Ferrocene was introduced into the gas stream by thermal evaporation concurrently with the flow of acetylene. Qu et al. reported a low-pressure CVD process on a SiO2/Si wafer that produces a VANTA consisting of CNTs with curly entangled ends. During the pyrolytic growth of the VANTAs, the initially formed nanotube segments from the base growth process grew in random directions and formed a randomly entangled nanotube top layer to which the underlying straight nanotube arrays then emerged. Zhong et al. studied purely thermal CVD process for SWNT forests without an etchant gas, and demonstrated that acteylene is the main growth precursor, and the conversion of any feedstock to C2H2 is of key importance to SWNT VANTA growth. A reactive etchant, such as water, atomic hydrogen, or hydroxyl radicals, can widen the SWNT forest deposition window but is not required in cold-wall reactors at low pressures. Dasgupta et al. synthesized a free-standing macro-tubular VANTA with a spray pyrolysis of ferrocene-benzene solution in a nitrogen atmosphere, with the optimum condition for the formation of macro-tubular geometry was found to be 950 ¬∞C, 50 mg/ml ferrocene in benzene, 1.5 ml/min pumping rate of liquid precursor and 5 lpm of nitrogen gas flow rate.  Temperature  At a too low temperature, the catalyst atoms are not mobile enough to aggregate together into particles to nucleate and grow nanotubes and the catalytic decomposition of the carbon precursor may be too slow for the formation of nanotubes. If the temperature is too high, the catalyst becomes too mobile to form particles small enough to nucleate and grow CNTs. A typical range of growth temperatures amenable to the CVD growth of VANTA is 600-1200 ¬∞C. The individual CNT structure is impacted by the growth temperature; a low-temperature CVD (600‚Äì900 ¬∞C) yields MWCNTs, whereas high-temperature (900‚Äì1200 ¬∞C) reaction favors SWCNT since they have a higher energy of formation. A critical temperature exists for each CVD system where the growth rate plateaus at a maximum value. The temperature dependence of the carbon nanotube growth with ferrocene exhibits a steep drop at high substrate temperatures and a loss of vertical alignment at 900 ¬∞C. Zhang et al. conducted VANTA growths on a series of Fe/Mo/vermiculite catalysts and reported that with the increasing growth temperature, the alignment of CNTs intercalated among vermiculites became worse.  Flow assisted growth  A key to high growth yields is a proper introduction of oxidative agents under the gas ambient so that the catalyst particle surfaces remain active for the longest possible period, which is presumably achieved by balancing the competition between amorphous carbon growth and sp2 graphitic crystal formation on the catalyst particles. Oxidants can not only remove or prevent amorphous carbon growth, but may also etch into graphite layers when used at higher than favorable concentrations. Hata et al. reported millimeter-scale vertically aligned 2.5 mm long SWCNTs using the water assisted ethylene CVD process with Fe/Al or aluminum oxide multilayers on Si wafers. It was proposed that controlled supply of steam into the CVD reactor acted as a weak oxidizer and selectively removed amorphous carbon without damaging the growing CNTs.  Field-assisted growth  Since CNTs are all electrically conductive they have a tendency to align with the electric field lines. Various methods have been developed to apply a strong enough electric field during the CNT growth process to achieve uniform alignment of CNTs based on this principle. The orientation of the aligned CNTs is mainly dependent on the length of CNTs and the electric field besides the thermal randomization and van der Waals forces. This technique has been employed to grow VANTAs by positively biasing the substrate during CVD growth. Another modified approach to grow VANTAs is to control the orientation of ferromagnetic catalysts that have one crystallographic magnetic easy axis. The magnetic easy axis tends to be parallel to the magnetic field. As a result, an applied magnetic force can orient these magnetic catalytic nanoparticles, like catalytic iron nanoparticles and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Because only a certain nanocrystalline facet of catalytic nanoparticles is catalytically active and the diffusion rate of carbon atoms on the facet is the highest, the CNTs preferentially grow from the certain facet of the catalytic nanoparticles and the grown CNTs are oriented at a certain angle.  Individually addressable nanostructures  Carbon nanotubes can be grown on a modified substrate to allow separate electrical contacts to each nanostructure. This nanotube growth is accomplished by lithographically placing metal traces separated by insulator material, and connecting those traces to individual catalyst sites on the substrate surface. The nanotubes are then grown as normal with CVD and a series of reactions at the catalyst forms a single junction between a nanotube and a metal contact. The nanostructures can then be individually functionalized and their electrical responses measured individually without crosstalk and other bottlenecks that arise from array heterogeneity. This technique, which accomplishes precise placement and configuration of individual nanotubes, unlocks and enhances a wide range of applications for VANTA‚Äôs: diagnostic testing for many analytes simultaneously, high energy density supercapacitors, field effect transistors, etc. = Plasma enhanced CVD =  Growth mechanism  In plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) processes, DC electric fields, radio-frequency electric fields, or microwaves produce plasmas to primarily lower the synthesis temperature of CNTs. At the same time, an electric field (DC or AC) is also produced over the substrate surface to direct CNT growth propagation. The DC-PECVD process for vertically aligned CNT arrays includes four basic steps: evacuation, heating, plasma generation, and cooling. A typical procedure is conducted at a pressure of 8 Torr in NH3 and at a growth temperature in the range of 450‚Äì600 ‚ó¶. As soon as the temperature and pressure are stabilized, a DC bias voltage of 450‚Äì650 V is applied to the gap between two electrodes to ignite an electrical discharge (plasma) over the sample. The growth time may vary from a couple of minutes to hours depending on the growth rate and desired CNT length. When the end of growth time is reached, the bias voltage is removed immediately to terminate the plasma. Zhong et al. reported a novel point-arc microwave plasma CVD apparatus employed to SWNTs on Si substrates coated with a sandwich-like nano- layer structure of 0.7 nm Al2O3/0.5 nm Fe/ 5‚Äì70 nm Al2O3 by conventional high frequency sputtering. The growth of extremely dense and vertically aligned SWNTs with an almost constant growth rate of 270 mm/h within 40 min at a temperature as low as 600 ¬∞C was demonstrated for the first time and the volume density of the as-grown SWNT films is as higher as 66 kg/m3.  Catalyst  The formation of a dense and relatively uniform layer of catalyst nanoparticles is also essential for vertically aligned SWCNT growth vertically aligned SWCNTs using the PECVD method. Amaratunga et al. reported the growth of vertically aligned CNTs using a direct current PECVD technique with a Ni and Co catalyst system. Their results show that the alignment of vertically aligned CNTs depends on the electric field and that the growth rate can be changed depending on the CNT diameter, which reaches a maximum as a function of growth temperature. VANTAs consisting of SWNTs have been grown as long as 0.5 cm. Zhong et al. reported a novel point-arc microwave plasma CVD apparatus employed to SWNTs on Si substrates coated with a sandwich-like nano- layer structure of 0.7 nm Al2O3/0.5 nm Fe/ 5‚Äì70 nm AlO by conventional high frequency sputtering. The growth of extremely dense and vertically aligned SWNTs with an almost constant growth rate of 270 mm/h within 40 min at a temperature as low as 600 ¬∞C was demonstrated for the first time and the volume density of the as-grown SWNT films is as higher as 66 kg/m.  Support  For PECVD processes, the substrate must be chemically stable under the plasma which is rich of H-species. Some weakly bonded oxides such as indium oxide can be quickly reduced in this plasma and is therefore usually not applicable as the substrate or underlayer. The substrate must also be electrically conductive to sustain a continuous DC current flow through its surface where the CNTs grow from. Most metals and semiconductors are very good substrate materials, and insulating substrates can be first coated with a conductive layer to work properly to support PECVD VANTA growth.  Carbon source  C2H2 is typically introduced to trigger the CNT growth during PECVD of VANTAs. The flow rate ratio of NH3:C2H2 is usually around 4:1 to minimize the amorphous carbon formation. Behr et al. studied the effect of hydrogen on the catalyst nanoparticles during the PECVD of VANTAs, and demonstrated that at H2-to-CH4 ratios of about 1 iron catalyst nanoparticles are converted to Fe3C and well-graphitized nanotubes grow from elongated Fe3C crystals. H2-to-CH4 ratios greater than 5 in the feed gas result in high hydrogen concentrations in the plasma and strongly reducing conditions, which prevents the conversion of Fe to Fe3C and cause poorly-graphitized nanofibers to grow with thick walls.  Temperature  One of the major advantages of using PECVD growth techniques is the low growth temperature. The ionization of the neutral hydrocarbon molecules inside the plasma facilitates the breaking of the C‚ÄìH bonds and lowers the activation energy of the CNT growth to be about 0.3eV as opposed to the 1.2eV needed for thermal CVD processes. = Electrophoretic deposition = CNT solutions can form VANTAs through alignment along DC or AC electric field lines. The CNTs are polarized in the suspension by the electric field because of dielectric mismatch between CNTs and the liquid. The polarization moment rotates the CNTs toward the direction of electric field lines, therefore aligning them in a common direction. After being aligned, the CNTs are taken out with the substrates and dried to form functional VANTAs. = Mechanical strain = Randomly oriented CNTs on a substrate can be stretched to straighten and detangle the film by breaking the substrate and pulling the ends apart. The aligned CNTs are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the crack. The stretching method can macroscopically align the CNTs while not providing deterministic control over individual CNT alignment or position during assembly.  Current applications  = Field-emission devices = CNTs have high aspect ratios (length divided by diameter) and induce very high local electric field intensities around the tips. Field emission in solids occurs in intense electric fields and is strongly dependent on the work function of the emitting material. In a parallel-plate arrangement, the macroscopic field Emacro between the plates is given by Emacro = V/d, where d is the plate separation and V the applied voltage. If a sharp object is created on a plate, then the local field Elocal at its apex is greater than Emacro and can be related to: Elocal=Œ≥√óEmacro The parameter Œ≥ is called the field-enhancement factor and basically determined by the shape of the object. Typical field-enhancement factors ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 can be obtained from individual CNTs, therefore making VANTAs one of the best electron-emitting materials. = Blackbody absorber = VANTAs offer a unique light absorbing surface due to their extremely low index of refraction and the nanoscale surface roughness of the aligned CNTs. Yang et al. demonstrated that low-density VANTAs exhibit an ultralow diffuse reflectance of 1 √ó 10-7 with a corresponding integrated total reflectance of 0.045%. Although VANTA black coatings must be directly transferred or grown on substrates, unlike black coatings consisting of random networks of CNTs that may be processed into CNT paints, they are the considered the blackest man- made material on earth. VANTA blackbody absorbers are thus useful as stray light absorbers to improve the resolution of sensitive spectroscopes, telescopes, microscopes, and optical sensing devices. Several commercial optical black coating products such as Vantablack and adVANTA nanotube optical blacks have been produced from VANTA coatings. VANTA absorbers may also increase the absorption of heat in materials used in concentrated solar power technology, as well as military applications such as thermal camouflage. Visual displays of VANTA absorbers have generated interest by artists as well seeking to benefit from the quenching of shadows from rough surface. Recently, Vantablack was used by artist Asif Khan to create the Hyundai Pavilion in Pyeongchang for the 2018 Winter Olympics. = Carbon fiber ropes = VANTAs can be processed through volatile solutions or twisted to condense into spun CNT yarns or ropes. Jiang et al demonstrated a spinning and twisting method that forms a CNT yarn from a VANTA that gives rise to both a round cross- section and a tensile strength of around 1 GPa. The tensile strengths of CNT yarns spun from ultra-long CNT arrays of 1 mm height can range from 1.35 to 3.3 GPa. = Unidirectional Sheets = Lui et al describe ways to control the physical properties of sheets spun from CNT arrays, including catalyst film thickness, to control tube diameter distribution and growth time to control tube length. These properties can be used to control the electrical and optical properties of the sheet spun from the array. The sheets may be useful in scientific applications, such as the polarization of light through the sheet (the degree of polarization can also be controlled by the temperature of the sheet). = Adhesive films = Biomimicry studies directed towards replicating the adhesion of gecko feet on smooth surfaces have reported success utilizing VANTA as a dry adhesive film. Qu et al. was able to demonstrate VANTA films that exhibited macroscopic adhesive forces of ~100 newtons per square centimeter, which is almost 10 times that of a gecko foot. This was achieved by tuning the growth conditions of the VANTA to form curls at the end of the CNTs, which provide stronger interfacial interactions even with a smooth surface. Qu et al. also demonstrated that the adhesive properties were less temperature sensitive than superglue and scotch tape. = Gas sensor = VANTAs allow the development of novel sensors and/or sensor chips without the need for direct manipulation of individual nanotubes. The aligned nanotube structure further provides a large well-defined surface area and the capacity for modifying the carbon nanotube surface with various transduction materials to effectively enhance the sensitivity and to broaden the scope of analytes to be detected. Wei et al. reported a gas sensor fabricated by partially covering a VANTA with a polymer coating top-down along their tube length by depositing a droplet of polymer solution (e.g., poly(vinyl acetate), PVAc, polyisoprene, PI) onto the nanotube film, inverting the composite film as a free-standing film , and then sputter-coating two strip electrodes of gold across the nanotube arrays that were protruding from the polymer matrix. The flexible VANTA device was demonstrated to successfully sense chemical vapors through monitoring conductivity changes caused by the charge-transfer interaction with gas molecules and/or the inter-tube distance changes induced by polymer swelling via gas absorption. To date, CNTs have shown sensitivities toward gases such as NH3, NO2, H2, C2H4, CO, SO2, H2S, and O2. = Biological sensor = VANTAs act as forests of molecular wires to allow electrical communication between the underlying electrode and a biological entity. The main advantages of VANTAs are the nanosize of the CNT- sensing element and the corresponding small amount of material required for a detectable response. The well-aligned CNT arrays have been employed to work as ribonucleic acid (RNA) sensors, enzymes sensors, DNA sensors, and even protein sensors. Similar VANTAs of MWNTs, grown on platinum substrates, are useful for amperometric electrodes where the oxygenated or functionalized open-ends of nanotubes are used for the immobilization of biological species, while the platinum substrate provides the signal transduction. To increase the selectivity and sensitivity of amperometric biosensors, artificial mediators and permselective coatings are often used in the biosensor fabrication. Artificial mediators are used to shuttle electrons between the enzyme and the electrode to allow operation at low potentials. Gooding et al. demonstrated that shortened SWNTs can be aligned normal to an electrode by self-assembly and act as molecular wires to allow electrical communication between the underlying electrode and redox proteins covalently attached to the ends of the SWNTs. The high rate of electron transfer through the nanotubes to redox proteins is clearly demonstrated by the similarity in the rate constant for electron transfer to MP-11 regardless of whether SWNTs are present or not. = Thermal interface materials = VANTA interfaces are more thermally conductive than conventional thermal interface materials at the same temperatures because phonons propagate easily along the highly thermally conductive CNTs and thus heat is transported in one direction along the alignment of the CNTs. The distribution and alignment of the thermally conductive CNT fillers are important factors to affect the phonon transport. Huang et al. demonstrated a thermally conductive composite shows an enhancement of 0.65W/m/K with a 0.3wt% loading of VANTA, whereas the enhanced thermal conductivity of a composite with of 0.3 wt% loading of randomly dispersed CNT is below 0.05W/m/K. Tong et. al reported that CNT arrays can be used effectively as thermal interface materials (TIM) due to their high conductance, which they report as ~10^5 W/m^2/K. Thermal interface materials are materials that can enhance thermal conduction at surfaces by having high thermal conductivities; it is useful to have materials which can be designed to fit any geometry. Additionally, the geometry of VANTA systems allows for anisotropic heat transfer. Ivanov et. al found that anisotropic heat transfer could be achieved with VANTAs: they achieved thermal diffusivities up to 2.10.2 cm^2/s, anisotropy ratios up to 72, and found thermal conductivites greater than those of materials used in microelectronics today. Heat transfer properties rely heavily on the structure of the array, so the methods used to manufacture the product must be uniform and reproducible for widespread use. Defects in the structure can also drastically disrupt the heat transfer properties of the material. = Solar cells = Vertically aligned periodic arrays of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used to create topographically enhanced light-trapping photovoltaic cells. The CNTs form the back contact of the device and serve as a scaffold to support the photoactive heterojunction. Molecular beam epitaxy is used to deposit CdTe and CdS as the p/n-type materials and ion-assisted deposition is used to deposit a conformal coating of indium-tin oxide as the transparent top contact. Photocurrent produced ‚Äúper cm2 of footprint‚Äù for the CNT-based device is 63 times that of a commercially available planar single crystal silicon device. = Transistors = VANTAs of SWNTs with perfectly linear geometries are applicable as high-performance p- and n-channel transistors and unipolar and complementary logic gates. The excellent properties of the devices derive directly from a complete absence, to within experimental uncertainties, of any defects in the arrays, as defined by tubes or segments of tubes that are misaligned or have nonlinear shapes. The large number of SWNTs enables excellent device-level performance characteristics and good device-to-device uniformity, even with SWNTs that are electronically heterogeneous. Measurements on p- and n-channel transistors that involve as many as about 2,100 SWNTs reveal device-level mobilities and scaled transconductance approaching about 1,000 cm2 V-1 s-1 and $3,000 S m-1, respectively, and with current outputs of up to about 1 A in devices that use interdigitated electrodes. = Low-dielectric material = The low Œ∫ materials with low relative dielectric constants are employed as the insulating layers in integrated circuits to reduce the coupling capacitance. The relative dielectric constant of electrically insulating layers can be reduced further by introducing cavities into the low-Œ∫ materials. If elongated and oriented pores are used, it is possible to reduce significantly the effective Œ∫ value without increasing the proportion of the cavity volume in a dielectric. The CNTs in VANTAs have a high aspect ratio and can be used to introduce elongated, oriented pores into a low-Œ∫ dielectric to further reduce the effective Œ∫ value of the dielectric. = Catalyst support = Palladium supported on vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Pd/VA-CNTs) is used as catalyst for the C-C coupling reactions of p-iodonitrobenzene with styrene and ethyl acrylate under microwave irradiation. Pd/VA-CNTs catalyst exhibits higher activity compared to Pd supported on activated charcoal, under the same reaction conditions. Due to the microwave irradiation, the kinetics of the reaction are strongly accelerated compared to that obtained with a traditional heating mode. The macroscopic form of aligned CNTs support allows an easy recovery of the catalyst, avoiding costly post-reaction separation processes. In addition, the interaction between the active phase and the support leads to negligible leaching of palladium during recycling tests. The observed results indicate that Pd/CNTs is a recyclable and stable heterogeneous catalytic system. = Fuel cell = Fuel cells are made up of three sandwiched segments: an anode, an electrolyte, and a cathode, in a reaction cell where electricity is produced inside the fuel cells through the reactions between an external fuel and an oxidant in the presence of an electrolyte. The anode hosts a catalyst that oxidizes the fuel, turning the fuel into positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. This fuel is typically hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and alcohols. The electrolyte blocks the transportation of electrons while conducting ions. The ions traveling through the electrolyte are re-united on the cathode with the electrons passing through a load during a reaction with an oxidant to produce water or carbon dioxide. Ideal anode supports for the deposition of catalytic nanoparticles are porous conductive materials to maximize the electrocatalytic activity. VANTAs are therefore ideal materials due to their intrinsic high conductivity, high surface area, and stability in most fuel cell electrolytes. A typical catalyst deposited on VANTA anodes is platinum, which can be electrodeposited on the individual CNTs of the VANTA. The electrocatalytic activity at the anode is optimal when the Pt particles are uniformly dispersed within the VANTA. Gong et al. reported that VANTAs doped with nitrogen can act as a metal-free electrode with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than platinum for oxygen reduction in alkaline fuel cells. In air-saturated 0.1 molar potassium hydroxide, a steady-state output potential of ‚Äì80 millivolts and a current density of 4.1 milliamps per square centimeter at ‚Äì0.22 volts was observed, as compared to ‚Äì85 millivolts and 1.1 milliamps per square centimeter at ‚Äì0.20 volts for a platinum-carbon electrode. The incorporation of electron-accepting nitrogen atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane appears to impart a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms. This effect, coupled with aligning the nitrogen-doped CNTs, provides a four-electron pathway for the oxygen reduction reactions on VANTAs with a superb performance. = Supercapacitors = Like ordinary capacitors, VANTA supercapacitors and electromechanical actuators typically comprise two electrodes separated by an electronically insulating material, which is ionically conducting in electrochemical devices. The capacitance for an ordinary planar sheet capacitor inversely depends on the inter-electrode separation. In contrast, the capacitance for an electrochemical device depends on the separation between the charge on the electrode and the countercharge in the electrolyte. Because this separation is about a nanometer for CNTs in VANTA electrodes, as compared with the micrometer or larger separations in ordinary dielectric capacitors, very large capacitances result from the high CNT surface area accessible to the electrolyte. These capacitances (typically 15 - 200 F/g, depending on the surface area of the nanotube array) result in large amounts of charge injection when only a few volts are applied. Futaba et al. reported a technique to form super-capacitors from a VANTA flattened by settling the erect CNTs by wetting them with a liquid. The capacitance of the SWNT solid EDLC was estimated as 20 F g‚àí1 from the discharge curves of cells charged at 2.5V for a two-electrode cell, and corresponds to 80 F g‚àí1 for a three-electrode cell. The energy density (W = CV2/2) was estimated to be 69.4 W h kg‚àí1 (from 80 F g‚àí1) when normalized to the single electrode weight. In Pitk√§nen et al., on-chip energy storage is demonstrated using architectures of highly aligned vertical carbon nanotubes acting as supercapacitors, capable of providing large device capacitances. The efficiency of these structures is further increased by incorporating electrochemically active nanoparticles such as MnOx to form pseudocapacitive architectures thus enhancing areal specific capacitance to 37 mF/cm2. = Batteries = Unlike in ultracapacitors where the solvent of the electrolyte is not involved in the charge storage mechanism, the solvent of the electrolyte contributes to the solid‚Äìelectrolyte interphase in batteries. The Li-ion batteries usually consist of an active carbon anode, a lithium‚Äìcobalt oxide cathode, and an organic electrolyte. In order to obtain better electrode performance than networks of random CNTs and CNT composites, VANTAs are used as to provide better electron transport and higher surface area. Nanostructured materials are gaining increased attention because of their potential to mitigate current electrode limitations. However, it is possible to use of vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (VA- MWNTs) as the active electrode material in lithium-ion batteries. At low specific currents, these VA-MWNTs have shown high reversible specific capacities (up to 782 mAh g‚àí1 at 57 mA g‚àí1). This value is twice that of the theoretical maximum for graphite and ten times more than their non-aligned equivalent. Interestingly, at very high discharge rates, the VA-MWNT electrodes retain a moderate specific capacity due to their aligned nature (166 mAh g‚àí1 at 26 A g‚àí1). These results suggest that VA-MWNTs are good candidates for lithium-ion battery electrodes which require high rate capability and capacity.  Future potential  = Space Elevator = Owing to the high tensile strength and large aspect ratio of carbon nanotubes, VANTAs are a potential tether material for the Space Elevator concept. = Silicon replacement in next generation transistors = Carbon nanotubes have much higher carrier mobility then silicon and thus can be much faster and more energy efficient when used in electronics as a silicon replacement. = Challenges obstructing commercialization = There are three main issues preventing broader-scale carbon nanotube-based technology commercialization: Separating metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, high junction resistance due to very small contact area, and placing the nanotubes exactly (nanometer resolution) where they need to go in the circuit. There has been a great deal of work in reducing the contact resistance in carbon nanotube devices. Researchers at UC Berkeley found that adding an interfacial graphite layer during synthesis decreased junction resistance. Researchers at IBM Watson have also attached chemical scaffolds at the base contact point of the nanotube, to a similar effect.

Early life Sarah was born in 1756. She was the eldest daughter of wealthy landowner William Livingston (1723‚Äì1790) and Susannah French (1723‚Äì1789). Her father was an attorney who was a signer of the United States Constitution and later served as the first post-colonial Governor of New Jersey during the American Revolutionary War from 1776 until his death in 1790. Her paternal grandparents were Philip Livingston, the 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor, and Catherine Van Brugh, the only child of Albany mayor Pieter Van Brugh (1666‚Äì1740). Her paternal uncles included Robert Livingston (1708‚Äì1790), 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor, Peter Van Brugh Livingston (1710‚Äì1792), New York State Treasurer, and Philip Livingston (1716‚Äì1778), who served as a member of the New York State Senate. Through her mother, she was descended from Phillip French, the 27th Mayor of New York City, Frederick Philipse, the 1st Lord of the Philipsburg Manor, and Anthony Brockholst, an acting Governor of Colonial New York. Society and diplomatic role Gubernatorial portrait of John Jay Following her wedding to Jay in 1774, she spent the early years of their marriage at her father's house in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. Her husband would visit her there when he was not serving as a state official in New York. In 1779, he was appointed commissioner to Spain and Sarah joined him, moving abroad. Her role as a society lady was equally important once this post was secured. In Spain, Sarah Livingston Jay's role in diplomacy was sufficiently important that she would receive one diplomatic visitor in her bedroom when she was too ill from morning sickness to rise.To Kitty Livingston from Sarah Livingston Jay, Aranjuez, May 18th, 1781 In France, she would plan and host the Americans' celebration of the signing of the Treaty of Paris, albeit in absentia because she had only just given birth (in Benjamin Franklin's house) when the event took place. History leaves too few traces of women, but if one's role in society smoothed the way for the diplomatic process (as Benjamin Franklin believed it did) then Sarah Livingston Jay can be credited with aiding in the ratification of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Sarah Livingston Jay regularly attended salons and the Monday night dinners hosted by the Marquise and Marquis de Lafayette.Maurois, Adrienne (1960) The Life of the Marquise de La Fayette. Jonathan Cape. p. 113 Participating in Parisian society was part of Benjamin Franklin's strategy for tightening the bonds of French-American relations. Sarah Livingston Jay played her part in society so well that she was once mistaken for Marie Antoinette by the audience of a theatre in Paris, \\"on the entrance of the American beauty, [the audience] arose to do her homage.\\"\\"Washington in New York, 1789,\\" The Century Magazine, London: 1889. p. 857. Her social circle included Adrienne de La Fayette, Angelica Schuyler Church, Abigail Adams, Abigail Adams Smith, and Anne Willing Bingham, and the connections forged by these linkages were crucial to future diplomatic successes (Angelica Church, for example, would assist John Jay socially when he traveled to London to negotiate what would become the Jay Treaty).Furstenberg, Fran√ßois (2015) When the U.S. Spoke French. Penguin Books. p. 323. =Return to New York= Upon returning to New York (when Mr. Jay was appointed U.S. Foreign Secretary), Livingston Jay's experiences in Europe and French language skills were applied to hosting officials from the diplomatic corps and other guests in the U.S. capital city of New York. Livingston Jay would go on to serve in her hospitality role as the wife of the first Chief Justice of the United States and First Lady of New York. In New York, \\"Mrs. [Elizabeth] Hamilton, Mrs. [Sarah] Jay and Mrs. [Lucy] Knox were the leaders of official society.\\"Humphreys, Mary Gay (1897). Catherine Schuyler. C. Scribner's Sons. p. 221. \\"In the society which marked the early days of the Republic, in New York, then the seat of the Continental Congress, Mrs. John Jay...was the acknowledged leader,\\" and Sarah Livingston Jay's \\"Dinner and Supper list\\" for 1787-8 contained the names of notable men and women who were the midwives of a new nation, including: General and Mrs. Washington, Colonel and Mrs. Bayard, Alexander and Elizabeth Hamilton, Dr. and Mrs. Rodgers, Elias Boudinot, Daniel Huger, and the DeLancey family. An image of her handwritten list is, considered \\"the most famous American \\"society\\"-type document of the eighteenth century\\". In an era when dinner tables were the nodes of social networks, when a house was not the private realm it is perceived to be now, the social capital inherent to a dinner list was tendered as political capital. Like many of the Founding Mothers, credit for any and all of Sarah Livingston Jay's contributions as spouse to a prominent politician have been subsumed by her husband's reputation (i.e. a consequence of coverture). As coverture is no longer the law of the land, however, subsuming Livingston Jay's biography under her husband's is to perpetuate history's error: \\"we think women were sitting around tending to the tatting or pouring tea, and it's our view of first ladies too and it's all wrong. These were very, very politically passionate women. Their letters are full of politics and they were utterly devoted to the patriot cause.\\" This misunderstanding may well have been less true in Sarah Livingston Jay's lifetime than it is today: \\"While denied direct participation in the political system, elite women's roles as republican wives and mothers was understood by Americans at this time as a political necessity.\\" Personal life The Jay home, \\"Locusts\\", in Rye, New York On April 28, 1774, Sarah married John Jay (1745‚Äì1829), a member of a prominent merchant family in New York City. He was one of seven surviving children born to Peter Jay and Mary Van Cortlandt, the daughter of mayor Jacobus Van Cortlandt. Together, John and Sarah Jay had six children: * Peter Augustus Jay, who was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1776 * Susan Jay, who was born and died in Madrid in 1780 * Maria Jay, who was born in Madrid in 1782 * Ann Jay, who was born in Paris in 1783 * William Jay, who was born in New York City in 1789 * Sarah Jay, who was born in New York City in 1792.

Life Samuel Rowe was born on 11 November 1793, second son of Benjamin Rowe, freeholding farmer of Sherford Barton, Brixton, Devon, and Mary Avent of St Budeaux, Devon. The Rowe family had lived at Brixton for several generations. He attended the nearby Plympton Grammar School. Rowe had \\"ever an insuperable distaste for agricultural pursuits.\\" The family thought of sending him to Oxford to study for entry into the Church of England. Instead he was made apprentice to a Kingsbridge, Devon, bookseller in 1810. In 1813 his father bought him an old- established bookshop in Plymouth, where his younger brother, Joshua Brooking Rowe, soon joined him. He devoted his free time to study and writing. Rowe became a close friend of Thomas Byrth (1793‚Äì1849), an avid if untutored reader and scholar. In 1814 they launched the Plymouth Literary Magazine and undertook an antiquarian tour of Cornwall. They published six issues of the magazine, the last appearing on 19 November 1814. Also in 1814 they established a boarding school in Plympton, which was also short-lived. In 1817 Rowe joined the Plymouth Athenaeum, which was called \\"the centre of all literary, scientific and artistic life in South Devon.\\" In 1821 he became the secretary of the Athenaeum. Rowe was a churchwarden under the evangelical Rev. John Hatchard at St. Andrew's, Plymouth, in the early 1820s. He matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1822, graduated B.A. in 1826 and M.A. in 1833. In 1824 he was ordained as a curate at St. Andrews under Hatchard. He was presented to the incumbency of St. Budeaux, and in 1832 became the first minister of a new church of St. Paul at Stonehouse, Plymouth. He was then transferred to the vacant incumbency of St. George, the older church of Stonehouse: these preferments were all in the gift of Hatchard. In 1835 Rowe was elected vicar of Crediton, Devonshire, out of seventy candidates. Samuel Rowe died at Crediton on 15 September 1853, and was buried in the churchyard. By his 1829 marriage to Sydney, daughter of Adam Neale, he left a son and five daughters. Work Rowe published a tourist guide to Plymouth in 1821. He also published epitomes of William Paley's Philosophy and Evidences, and several religious books and tracts. In 1830 Rowe published an article on Antiquarian Investigations in the Forest of Dartmoor, Devon in the Transactions of the Plymouth Athenaeum. In it he incorrectly stated that Cosdon Hill was the highest summit in Dartmoor. He published an 8 volume book on Gothic architecture in 1844. Rowe published A Perambulation of Dartmoor in 1848 as a result of fieldwork carried out in 1827‚Äì28. The book is dedicated to Albert, Prince of Wales. It described and listed all the known ancient monuments on Dartmoor, with many picturesque illustrations. The book became recognised as the standard account of Dartmoor. It presents and compares the views of earlier antiquarians. For example, it discusses the Drewsteignton cromlech (Spinsters' Rock) in some detail and gives views on the possibility that it was a Druid monument expressed by writers including Borlase, Chapple and Polwhele. Rowe thought the cromlech (dolmen) was primarily a sepulchre, but thought it was possibly also an altar where the Druids made sacrifices. The Perambulation was reprinted in 1856. It was thoroughly revised by his nephew, J. Brooking Rowe, and published in 1895 with much new material added, and with many illustrations by the Devon artist Frederick John Widgery. The new edition has a portrait of Rowe. The changing views of antiquarians through the 19th century are well illustrated in the revised edition.

Tory Professor of Law. Before taking over from interim dean Jutta Brunn√©e on January 1, 2015 for a five-year term, he was a professor in the faculty, the faculty‚Äôs associate dean of research, and the Osler Chair in Business Law. His primary research areas are corporate law, competition law, and the intersection of economics and the law.  Early life and career  Edward Iacobucci is the son of Frank Iacobucci, a former puisne justice on the Supreme Court of Canada who was dean of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law from 1979 to 1983. Iacobucci earned a bachelor's degree (honours) in economics from Queen's University, a Master of Philosophy degree, also in economics, from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Toronto. From 1996 to 1997, he clerked for John Sopinka, a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.  Academic career  Iacobucci joined the University of Toronto Faculty of Law in 1998. In 2002, he was a John M. Olin visiting fellow at Columbia University Law School. He has also been a visiting professor at New York University Law School and the University of Chicago Law School. In 2003, Iacobucci, along with Paul Collins, Michael Trebilock, and Ralph Winter won the Canadian Economics Association's Doug Purvis Memorial Prize for their book The Law and Economics of Canadian Competition Policy. In 2011, Iacobucci was appointed as the C. D. Howe Institute's Competition Policy Scholar, and was reappointed to that position in 2015. Iacobucci, along with Lawson Hunter and Michael Trebilcock were co- authors in a 2014 C.D. Howe Institute study called \\"Let the Market Decide: The Case against Mandatory Pick-And-Pay\\" about the Canadian telecommunications and broadcasting industry. In 2016, during Iacobucci's tenure as dean, the University of Toronto Faculty of Law created the J.R. Kimber Chair for Investment Rights, which was the first research chair for investor rights in North America; the position was first held by future federal cabinet minister Anita Anand. Iacobucci is an independent member of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC)'s board of directors and the chair of its Corporate Governance Committee. Mid-September 2020 articles in the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail ‚Äîbased on interviews and corroborated by correspondence between the university and faculty staff‚Äîalleged that Iacobucci had rescinded an offer to legal scholar Valentina Azarova to become the director of the faculty's International Human Rights Program (IHRP), under pressure from Justice David Spiro, a member of the Tax Court of Canada, who is an alumni of and donor to the university. According to the Star , Azarova‚Äîwho was the faculty advisory board's \\"unanimous choice\\"‚Äîhad accepted the offer of the IHRP directorship in mid-August. In a mid-September letter to Iacobucci, two former IHRP directors, told the dean, that the Tax Court judge had expressed his concerns about Azarova's research on Israeli occupation‚Äîspecifically her criticism of Israel's settlements in Palestine‚Äîto the administration. Shortly after, Azarova's offer was rescinded. A University of Haifa Faculty of Law associate professor, said that Azarova's criticism of Israel and the settlements was not \\"exotic\\", but rather a \\"kind of majority position around the world\\"‚Äîa \\"long-standing criticism\\" of \\"human rights violations of international law\\". In protest, the entire advisory board resigned en masse. In an October 14 email, Dean Iacobucci told professors that he had ordered an impartial review of the hiring process which will result in a January 2021 report. The announcement came amid calls from \\"lawyers, academics, rights groups and public intellectuals from around the world\\" for an independent review. The Canadian Judicial Council is \\"considering multiple complaints\\" against Justice Spiro. According to the Globe and Mail, Justice Simon and his extended family, including the Tanenbaum's, have been generous donors over the years to the university. Dean Iacobucci denies any wrongdoing and says the reason for rescinding the offer to Azarova was related to an immigration technicality.

Early life and marriage Clara Mae Stover was born in Oxford, Iowa, in 1882. Clara Mae was raised on a farm, with her three sisters, who were required to do to manual labor since their parents had no sons. Through the strong influence of her grandma, Clara Stover was a very independent woman, who took the initiative to be self-reliant and knowing how to get things done. Clara and Russell Stover met, as students in Iowa City, Iowa, at the Iowa City Academy. Over the years, they kept in touch and got married in 1911. The Stovers decided to buy a 580-acre, wheat and flax farm in Saskatchewan, Canada. Unfortunately, heavy rains destroyed their crops. Introduction to candy industry Russell Stover was hired by a candy company, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Years later, the Stovers decided to move back to the United States, where Russell worked for confectioners, in Des Moines, Iowa and Chicago, Illinois, during the 1910s. Throughout the process, Russell Stover became very familiar with the candy-making process. Everything, from the production to the sale, of chocolates. This began Clara and Russell's dream of a chocolate empire, that still thrives today. Clara Stover would actually dip the chocolates, herself, in their apartment kitchen. Russell Stover, would in turn, sell them to neighborhood druggists, on the weekends. Creation of \\"Eskimo Pie\\" In 1921, Russell Stover, studying chemistry, at the University of Iowa and business partner, Iowa schoolteacher, Christian Nelson patented a process, by which ice cream could be coated, with chocolate, without melting. At a dinner party, Clara suggested calling it an \\"Eskimo Pie\\", which became a national sensation. Russell was soon offered licensing agreements, and buyout offers, some millions of dollars. He was also, in lawsuits, suing imitators, hiring many lawyers. Instead, of taking the buyout offers, Stover waited too long and sales plummeted, leaving sales at only several thousand dollars.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 12.

Through their successes and failures, they were now prepared to officially run a successful candy business. Russell and Clara Mae Stover began to build factories in Denver and Kansas City, Missouri. In 1931, the Russell Stover Company headquarters was moved to Kansas City, increasing its output, from 20,000 to 11 million pounds, of candy production. In 1943, Mrs. Stover's Bungalow Candies was renamed \\"Russell Stover Candies\\".Russell Stover Chocolates Timeline Mrs. Stover and Stover candy legacy In 1954, Russell Stover died, after leaving his significant contributions to the American candy industry.

She spent most of her career as a nurse during the Civil War on hospital ships that tended to Union and Confederate soldiers all along the Mississippi River. Adaline moved to St. Louis, Missouri around 1823 from England and eventually married John Edward Decker Couzins in 1834. Adaline and John had four children. Their daughter, Phoebe Couzins, was one of the first female lawyers in the United States. Adaline's first civil service was during the cholera epidemic of 1849 as she and her husband headed its relief corps. After Adaline heard of the Civil War she began working under Dr. Charles Pope, a surgeon in St. Louis. Adaline then joined the Ladies' Union Aid Society of St. Louis and was sent out to work in the field. While on the hospital ships she worked under Simon Pollack who was the chief surgeon for the Western Sanitary Commission. While rescuing and caring for soldiers, Adaline was injured twice. She was first severely frostbitten in 1862 and then struck by a minie-ball fragment in 1863 at the siege of Vicksburg. Despite her injuries, Adaline continued her nursing duties. After the Civil War, Adaline continued on her work as a civil servant. She founded the Female Guardian Home of St. Louis, headed the Ladies' Sanitary Corps of the Special Health Department of St Louis, and campaigned for women's suffrage. Before her death, she was granted government pension on May 27, 1888, for her unrelenting services during the Civil War.  Early and family life  Adaline Weston Couzins was born on August 12, 1815 in Brighton, England. In about 1823, at the age of eight, she relocated to St. Louis, Missouri with her parents. Several years after her move to St. Louis, Adaline married John Edward Decker Couzins in 1834. John Couzins started his career as a carpenter, but later served as St. Louis's chief of police during the American Civil War, and from 1884 to 1887 he served as the U.S. marshal of the eastern district of Missouri. Adaline and John had four children together and their daughter, Phoebe Couzins was not only the first female graduate from Washington University Law School in St. Louis, but was also one of the first female lawyers in the United States, an advocate for women's suffrage, and she was the first female U.S. Marshal.  Early career  In 1849 there was a cholera epidemic in St. Louis, Missouri. During this time in U.S. history there were few hospitals established and not near enough nurses to handle an epidemic like this. That left the responsibility of caring for the sick to family members and volunteers. Adaline and John were two of those volunteers, and headed the relief corps for this epidemic and worked tirelessly to nurse the sick back to health. This was just the first stepping stone of Adaline's long nursing career and civil service.  Civil War nursing career  In April 1861, shortly after the start of the American Civil War, Adaline volunteered to work with Dr. Charles Pope, a surgeon in St. Louis. Together, with other volunteers, they transported wounded soldiers from trains to the New House of Refuge Hospital, where Adaline helped by washing and bandaging the soldier's wounds. To continue her efforts in the war, Adaline joined the Ladies' Union Aid Society (LUAS) of St. Louis. Adaline worked closely with the society's president, Anna L. Clapp. She went on many missions to service and save soldiers while working with LUAS. Adaline was oftentimes sent out to battlefields to inspect their conditions and report the number of casualties, putting herself in great danger. Her volunteer efforts were not limited to her time on the battlefields though, as she began working on hospital ships under Dr. Simon Pollack, the chief surgeon for the Western Sanitary Commission, at the end of the American Civil War. These ships went all along the Mississippi River allowing her to tend to many soldiers in battle. Adaline was praised by the doctors she serviced during this time for her hard, selfless work. Although she was a reliable and consistent worker, she unfortunately, was not paid for her work. Adaline oftentimes even paid her own travel expenses so that she was able to provide her much needed services to the American soldiers. = Injuries during the War = In the winter of 1862, Adaline endured her first serious injury while working as a Civil War nurse. She suffered from serious frostbite after her and another LUAS member, Arethusa L. Forbes, went out to inspect the condition of a battlefield and report the number of casualties. Because of their efforts, hospital cars were sent to save those soldiers who were wounded but still alive. While Adaline recovered from the frostbite, Arethusa did not, and was unable to volunteer such services in the future. While working on a hospital ship in 1863, Adaline was once again injured. The ship she was on had stopped in Vicksburg, Mississippi to gather wounded soldiers to take back to St. Louis, and while she was there, Adaline was struck in the knee by minie-ball. Although her injury did not stop her from continuing her services as a nurse, it did cause her problems later in life.  Post Civil War contributions  Even after the American Civil War ended, Adaline could not stop her career as a civil servant. She founded the Female Guardian Home of St. Louis and headed the Ladies' Sanitary Corps of the Special Health Department of St. Louis where she was able to continue her services as a nurse. Adaline also took part in campaigning for women's suffrage and advocated for women's rights.  Later life  = Government pension = Many people appreciated Adaline's service during the American Civil War and recognized the need to compensate her for her work. Both her daughter Phoebe Couzins and Michigan Senator Thomas W. Paler petitioned for Adaline to receive pension for her service in the war. During the debate for her pension in the Congressional House of Representatives it was said by Mr. O'Neill that she deserved the pension because she had done more \\"for the suffering, sick, and wounded soldiers, Confederate and Federal alike, than any other women in the Mississippi Valley\\". After debating the amount of money she would receive, Congress recognized her contributions in 1888. The bill, Bill No. 2356, was passed on October 1, 1888 granting Adaline Weston Couzins a government pension of $30 per month.\\"Chapter 13, 50 Congress, Session 2, Joint Resolution: Appointing H.H.

The Aztecs and other Nahuatl speakers called tortillas tlaxcalli (). First made by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica before colonization, tortillas are a fundamental part of the cuisines of many countries of the American continent. The origin of the corn tortilla in Mesoamerica dates back to before 500 BC. A nopaltilla is a cactus-corn tortilla. Varieties A Mexican indigenous woman prepares maize while making tortillas. Tulum and Coba, Yucat√°n, Mexico. =Corn tortilla= Tortillas made with maize (corn) are the oldest variety of tortilla originated in Mexico and Guatemala, and remain popular in North, Central and South America. Evidence shows the peoples of the Oaxaca region in Mexico made tortillas at the end of the Villa Stage (1500 to 500 BC).Towards the end of the 19th century, the first mechanical utensils for making tortillas, called tortilla presses, tortilleras, or tortilladoras, were invented and manufactured in Mexico. =Wheat tortilla= Europeans introduced wheat and its cultivation to the American continent, and it remains the source for wheat flour tortillas. Wheat flour tortillas were originated in the northern region of Mexico. Wheat tortillas usually contain fats such as oil or lard, salt, often leavening agents such as baking powder, and other ingredients. Otherwise, the preparation and cooking of flour tortillas on a comal is identical to that of corn tortillas. Flour tortillas are commonly used in dishes like burritos, tacos, and fajitas. It is part of the daily food repertoire in throughout Mexico, whose gastronomy and culture has influenced those of many Central American countries and some states in the U.S. =Nopaltilla= A nopaltilla is a cactus-corn tortilla.

Etymology In Yoruba language, √åy√° mi literally means \\"my mother\\". In Yoruba cosmology, the mother's roles as the force of creation and the sustainer of life and existence elevates her to the realm of the divine. Consequently, √åy√° mi - with alterations in tones - becomes √åy√†√†mi or √åy√†mi, which can be translated as \\"the super-powerful ones\\" or \\"My Mysterious Mother.\\" √Äj·∫πÃÅ is a Yoruba word that signifies the biological and spiritual power of African women that has myriad potential, including but not limited to, powers of elemental, biological and artistic creation; healing; destruction; spiritual and physical development and fortification; and political organization and empowerment. In The Architects of Existence: √Äj·∫πÃÅ in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature, Teresa N. Washington defines √Äj·∫πÃÅ as \\"a force that is beyond definition, but English approximations for √Äj·∫πÃÅ would be Power, Creation, Cosmos, All.\\" Praise names Iyami Aje are known by many praise names which include, but are not limited to, Iyami Osoronga, Awon Iya Wa (Our Mothers), Eleye (Owner(s) of the Sacred Bird), Iyanla, Awon Agbalagba (The Wise and Formidable Elders), Elders of the Night, Old and Wise One(s), the \\"Gods of Society,\\" Ay√© (Earth), Yew√°j·ªçb√≠ (The Mother of All the √ír√¨·π£√† and All Living Things), and √Äj·∫πÃÅ, as the latter term signifies both the power and the individual wielding it. Description In Yoruba cosmology, the Orisha Od√π is the Creator of the Universe and all that thrives within it. She is the originator of existence and the womb of all origins: Yoruba spiritualist Samuel M. Opeola states that, \\"√Äj·∫πÃÅ actually is Od√π.\\" African women, the direct biological and spiritual progeny of Od√π, are said to all inherently bear various aspects of her signature force: √Äj·∫πÃÅ. √Äj·∫πÃÅ is primarily associated with women because of their essential roles in conceiving, carrying, birthing, and nurturing children; however, African men, including African gods, can also have and be √Äj·∫πÃÅ. Opeola states that \\"any √ír√¨·π£√† regarded [as essential] in creation, childbirth, protection of a town also possesses the power of √Äj√©\\" (including ·ªåb√†t√°l√°, ·ªåbal√∫ay√©, √íg√∫n, and Od√πduw√†, to name a few gods). However, with its origins cosmically in Od√π, the Womb of Existence, and biologically in the menstruating, conceiving, birthing wombs of existence, African women are the owners and controllers of Aje. Because of its scope and power, Aje is feared and revered by many. Some individuals have attempted to demonize Aje by translating the word as witch, but in a 1958 article Ulli Beier disputed this translation, saying that it was not an \\"accurate translation of Aje since Aje ‚Äúrepresents rather the mystic powers of womanhood in their more dangerous destructive aspect.\\" Henry and Margaret Drewal wrote that \\"Any elderly woman, her longevity implying secret knowledge and power, may be regarded as an aje, as are all who hold important titles in cults for the gods and ancestors. The feeling is that in order to fulfill her role properly she must possess such power.\\" Using the term \\"witch\\" is especially dangerous because in many African communities the accused can be ostracized or lynched because of false accusations. Ayo Adeduntan's article, \\"Calling √Äj·∫πÃÅ Witch In Order To Hang Her: Yoruba Patriarchal Definition and Redefinition of Female Power,\\" analyzes the impact of the misuse of the term witch in Yoruba societies and the necessary usage of culturally appropriate and accurate Yoruba terms. In some cases, to protect the bearers of power and avoid confusion, terms such as \\"Elders of the Night,\\" Ay√©, and Awon Iya Wa may be used euphemistically. History Gelede Mask Iya Nla Gelede The history of Aje begins with existence. The Gods who are synonymous with Aje are Od√π and Od√πduw√†, and in Olodumare: God in Yoruba Belief, E. Bolaji Idowu defines Od√πduw√† as the \\"self-existent . . .Chief who created being. In his article \\"The Spider, the Chameleon and the Creation of the Earth,\\" Oduyoye finds that Od√πduw√† means,\\"Oracular utterance created existence.\\" In The Architects of Existence: Aje in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature, Teresa N. Washington states that \\"as the galactic Mother of All, Od√π is logically the source of all √¨w√† (identity, character, existence) which finds its origin and apex in the undiluted power of pure cosmic Blackness (D√∫d√∫).\\" Washington defines the meaning of Od√πduw√†, as \\"The Immense Womb or Pot (Od√π) of Infinite Depths and Blackness (D√∫d√∫) that contains all Attributes, Characteristics, and Identities.\\" Aje is an ancient force that predates the concepts of \\"Yoruba\\" and \\"Ifa\\" by millennia; however, the Odu Ifa also include various texts about Aje.For a detailed analysis of Aje in the Odu Ifa, please see chapter three, \\"Awon Iya Wa in the Ese Ifa,\\" of Teresa N Washington's The Architects of Existence: Aje in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature. An ese Ifa in Ose Otura describes how male Gods tried to create the world without the female God, ·ªå·π£un, who is often heralded as the \\"leader\\" of Aje. The males failed and it was only when they included ·ªå·π£un that the world could be formed. In as ese Ifa of Osa Meji Odu or Oduduwa is the only female among three other male divinities and being given the power of motherhood and Aje by Olodumare, which carries inherent power that must be respected. Other origin texts suggest that Yemoja is the leader of Iyami as well as the founder and owner of Gelede, a society devoted to Iyami. While the town of Ota, Nigeria is the town most readily associated with Aje, Aje has always flourished in Africa and in the lands of the diaspora to which the Yoruba traveled either by their own volition or as victims of slavery. Aje are known to preside over the market, and the Iyalode serves as the head of commerce and business in most Yoruba towns and cities. Iyami Aje also continue to occupy essential positions of power in Yoruba sacred societies and political institutions. Iyami became demonized as more patriarchal regimes came into power under Abrahamic faiths, causing many to go into secrecy to avoid persecution and possible death. The influx of Abrahamic faiths and the European witch-hunts of Europe during the 1700s coincided with the influx of Islamic and Christian colonialism and the slave trade in West Africa. Traditional ceremonies once performed by women became the domain of men; in some cases, rulers prohibited women from attending festivals to ensure that they would not participate. The Gelede festivals helped to ensure the reverence and praise of Iyami Aje would not be vanquished or silenced. During these festivals, entire communities gather to thank and praise the Iyami Aje for their protection and support of the community. The Gelede festival reveres Iyami as gods and ancestral mothers, and one of the most heralded aspects of Iyami Aje in Gelede is Iyami Osoronga, who is also honored as Iya Nla (Great Mother), and is represented by a white mask during the Gelede festival. According to Babatunde Lawal in The Gelede Spectacle, Iya Nla is Yewajobi, Iyami Iya (The Mother of All and the Mother of Mothers). Principles, Functions, and Roles Samuel M. Opeola states that √Äj·∫πÃÅ is rooted in three primary principles: 1\\\\. Do not dabble in herbalism (do not use herbs without thorough knowledge of their nature, use and divine authorization). 2\\\\. Do not display wealth. 3\\\\. Share everything. Opeola asserts that √Äj·∫πÃÅ are \\"against class systems\\" and \\"exploitation.\\" From a position rooted in acknowledgement of equality, √Äj·∫πÃÅ work to ensure societal, political, and cultural balance and harmony. One of the many praise names for the √Äj·∫πÃÅ collective is ·∫∏gb·∫πÃÅ ·ªåÃÄgb√†, which means a collective of equals. That √Äj·∫πÃÅ is rooted in equality illustrates key differences between contemporary Yoruba ontology and that of the autochthonic inhabitants of Ile-Ife. The aboriginal inhabitants of Ile-Ife distinguished themselves from their Yoruba migrant-guests by calling themselves On√≠m·ªçl·∫πÃÄ, which means \\"owner of the land.\\" The On√≠m·ªçl·∫πÃÄ (also known as Im·ªçl·∫πÃÄ and M·ªçl·∫πÃÄ) way of life was grounded and structured by √Äj·∫πÃÅ, balance, and reciprocity rather than the hierarchical stratification and ritual obeisance for which many African cultures, including that of the contemporary Yoruba, are known. In The Architects of Existence, Teresa N. Washington discusses the significance of ·∫∏gb·∫πÃÅ ·ªåÃÄgb√† worldview on what is known today as the Yoruba culture: > ·∫∏gb·∫πÃÅ ·ªåÃÄgb√† also appears to signify the original M·ªçl·∫πÃÄ way of life and > worldview which are rooted in egalitarianism. The significance of social > equality is evident in the founding of √ígb√≥ni, in which all members of the > nation, without distinction, were collectively initiated; in the rules that > √Äj·∫πÃÅ must \\"share everything\\" and must not engage in displays of wealth; in > the edict that babal√°wo are in service to their communities and cannot use > their [spiritual] gifts to generate personal wealth; and in the monarchical > fa√ßade that shields the careful labors of an intricately interconnected > network of √Äj·∫πÃÅ-rich power wielders. The Mother-son dynamic of √Äj·∫πÃÅ also > signifies egalitarianism, because Mother has milk, love, and protection for > all of her offspring, and all of her progeny, ·ªçm·ªç On√≠l·∫πÃÄ, are working for > the fortification and glorification of On√≠l·∫πÃÄ, who fortifies and glorifies > humanity. Because of the millennia-long interweaving of the two cultures--Onimole and Yoruba--some laypersons have assumed that √Äj·∫πÃÅ is structured hierarchically in ways similar to Yoruba culture, but that is not the case.There are no priests or priestesses of √ÄjÃ£·∫πÃÅ, no \\"godmothers\\" and \\"godfathers\\" of √ÄjÃ£·∫πÃÅ, and there is no color-coded hierarchy within √Äj·∫πÃÅ. Yoruba cultural historians Bade Ajuwon and Samuel M. Opeola confirm that before the colonization of Africa, with its attendant racism and religious hypocrisy, there was no concept of hierarchically tiered \\"white,\\" (funfun) \\"red,\\" (pupa) or \\"black\\" (dudu) √Äj·∫πÃÅ. Washington finds that the concept of color-coded √Äj·∫πÃÅ was created and used by people and organizations to protect themselves from racist religious and political persecution. √Äj·∫πÃÅ is considered to be a genetic, biological, and spiritual endowment that manifests itself uniquely in each of its bearers not unlike an individual's or√≠ (destiny), √†·π£·∫π (personal spiritual authority), and √¨w√† (existence, character). Consequently, √Äj·∫πÃÅ work together, as a collective, to learn, teach, evolve, expand, and restructure on personal and communal levels. The work of √Äj·∫πÃÅ is that which fortifies the lives of community members and strengthens society as a whole. They are the gynecologists, obstetricians, general practitioners, counselors, psychologists, diviners, physicists, mathematicians, architects, scientists, navigators, and agriculturalists of their communities. However, the role they are most feared for is that of enforcer of justice. This is undertaken by a collective (·∫πgb·∫πÃÅ) that includes members of √ígb√≥ni, a Yoruba sacred society of elders intricately connected with √Äj·∫πÃÅ, and O·π£√≥, empowered males who may or may not have √Äj·∫πÃÅ. O·π£√≥ are described as the \\"husbands of √Äj√©.\\" √Äj·∫πÃÅ, √ígb√≥ni, and O·π£√≥ have been described as \\"partners of progress,\\" and their individual and collective works are all overseen by ·∫∏dan, the Orisa of justice, whose eyes never close and, thus, bear witness to everything, and On√≠l·∫πÃÄ, the Owner of the Earth/Mother of the Earth, who is also known as Ay√©. The fact that √Äj·∫πÃÅ are also known as Ay√©, Earth, highlights the seamless nature of the Mothers' cosmic and terrestrial interrelationships. Because of the seriousness of the ·∫∏gb·∫πÃÅ √Äj·∫πÃÅ 's work, the secrecy and silence that shields the ·∫∏gb·∫πÃÅ, and the formidable checks and balances that ensure the accurate dispensation of justice, Yoruba historian and artist Adebayo Faleti describes √Äj·∫πÃÅ as \\"the most disciplined cult in the world. √Äj·∫πÃÅ cannot be bought, sold or commodified. Similarly, the ·∫∏gb·∫πÃÅ √Äj·∫πÃÅ, a timeless consortium with unimaginably deep responsibilities, does not publicize, solicit, recruit, or advertise: it is necessarily both a secret and a sacred society. It is described as being at once invisible and ubiquitous. In √ågb√†gb·ªçÃÅ √†ti ·∫∏ÃÄs√¨n Yor√πb√°, C. L. Adeoye states that the ·∫∏gb·∫πÃÅ's members take their work so seriously that they all adhere to the following diktat: \\"That the eyes should see / That the ears should hear / That the mouth should be silent.\\" Additional Attributes Like Mother Gods in other cultures, they have a triune function as creators, sustainers, and destroyers of life. Historically the role of resurrecting the dead to determine cause of death when it was in question was assigned to them. Because of the relationship to Mother Earth, Iyami Aje are also known for their extensive use of natural resources such as herbs and animals for healing and empowerment. All birds especially owls, vultures, and parrots (particularly the African Grey) are associated with Iyami. Iyami Aje and Community Perceptions While Aje is largely associated with women and female gods, Opeola's revelation that \\"any √ír√¨·π£√† regarded [as essential] in creation, childbirth or the protection of a town also possesses the power of √Äj√©\\" makes it clear that it is vital for certain men - divine and terrestrial - to have Aje. Indeed, Washington and Opeola concur that \\"to undertake certain duties and fulfill certain roles, certain males must have √Äj·∫πÃÅ. The significance and ubiquity of Aje in the Yoruba world is such that a common Yoruba saying observes, \\"You have Aje; I have Aje; We all have Aje in our pockets.\\" This acknowledgement of a communal inheritance of a power that is diverse and as unique as each individual bearer is what prompts Olatubosun Oladapo, a renowned Yoruba poet and lyricist who is known as Od√≠d·∫πr·∫πÃÅ Ay√©k√≤√≥t·ªçÃÅ (or the sacred grey parrot of √Äj·∫πÃÅ), to ask of his audience in one of his verses, \\"Emi Lo √ì M√°a F√†j·∫πÃÅ·∫πÃÄ R·∫π ·π¢e? (What Will You Do With Your Own √Äj·∫πÃÅ?).\\" Recently, in the diaspora, interest in Yoruba culture and a rise in initiations into Ifa and Orisha have led outsiders to question whether or not one can acquire √Äj·∫πÃÅ from an external agent and whether or not one can be initiated into the ·∫∏gb·∫πÃÅ √Äj·∫πÃÅ. One can even find individuals touting what they claim are \\"Aje\\" products (such as soaps, oils, medicines, rocks, and pots) and \\"initiation\\" into √Äj·∫πÃÅ: it is important here to refer to the principles of √Äj·∫πÃÅ detailed above. The question of whether and how initiations into Iyami Aje can occur is contentious for many, with some asserting that one cannot be initiated, others claiming that initiation can be done, and some individuals asserting that no one can choose to initiate as Iyami and only Iyami can choose who they will initiate as Iyami. The emphasis may be placed on the ability to choose, rather than no initiation existing. The book, Iyanifa: Women of Wisdom notes that the contradiction of suggesting no one can initiate or claim to have been initiated while simultaneously saying only Iyami can initiate demonstrates the fallacy of the statement itself. In his book Invisible Powers of the Metaphysical World, Araba Yemi Elebuibon asserts that initiations do occur. Some initiatory processes are also explained in the Ifa Literary Corpus under the odu Osa Meji where the Iyalode initiates women of the town.

It was launched on 5 July 2017. It is the fourth satellite of the EpicNG service and covers the Americas, Europe and Sub-Sahara Africa from the 34.5¬∞ west longitude. It has a mixed C band and Ku band, with the C band featuring EpicNG spot beams. Satellite description Intelsat 35e was designed and manufactured by Boeing on the Boeing 702MP satellite bus. It had a launch mass of , the largest Intelsat's currently active satellite, and has a design life of more than 15 years. It is powered by two wings, with four panels each, of triple-junction GaAs solar cells. The 702MP platform was designed to generate between 6 and 12 kW. Its payload was the fourth high- throughput EpicNG deployment. The EpicNG is characterized by the implementation of frequency reuse due to a mix of frequency and polarization in small-spot beams. Not only applied to the classical HTS Ka band, but also applying the same technique in Ku band and C band. The EpicNG series also keep the use of wide beams to offer high throughput and broadcast capabilities in the same satellite. In the case of Intelsat 35e, the C-band side has EpicNG spot beams with a total downlink bandwidth of 4,356 MHz. The spot beams offer high bandwidth for Europe, Sub-Sahara Africa, and the Americas. The Ku band has 39 transponder equivalents for a total downlink bandwidth of 1,404 MHz. Of the Ku three wide beams, one is covering the Caribbean, another Europe and the Mediterranean, and the third beams cover Europe and Northern Africa. History Launch of Intelsat 35e in Cape Canaveral. In July 2009, Intelsat became the first customer of the Boeing 702MP platform, when it placed an order for four spacecraft to be built, Intelsat 21, Intelsat 22, Intelsat 27 and the first EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e. In May 2013, Intelsat contracted for an additional four EpicNG satellites, the first of which would be Intelsat 33e. On July 8, 2014, Boeing announced a ninth 702MP order, and sixth EpicNG, for the Intelsat 35e. During 2014, Intelsat announced to service contract where the clients would start using Intelsat 903 at the 34.5¬∞ west position and then seamlessly transfer their services to Intelsat 35e as soon as it was commissioned into service. = Launch history = Following two aborted launch attempts earlier in July, Intelsat 35e was launched on 5 July 2017 from the SpaceX-leased launch pad 39A in Florida. No attempt to recover the first-stage booster was made on this launch, as the first stage was flown in expendable mode in order to maximize the orbital energy imparted to this high-mass commsat.http://spacenews.com/spacex-crests-double-digit-marker-notches-tenth- launch-in-a-single-year-for-first-time/ For planning purposes, the launch had been planned for as early as 1Q2017. During an interview with Intelsat's CEO Stephen Spengler in February 2016, it was disclosed that Intelsat 35e was expected to launch in 2017. In August 2016, it emerged that the launch was assigned to a Falcon 9 Full Thrust mission scheduled for the first quarter of 2017. Performance improvements of the Falcon 9 vehicle family enable the launch of this 6-tonne satellite without upgrading to a Falcon Heavy variant. Intelsat 35e was initially prepared for launch on 2 July 2017 from launch pad 39A, with a 59-minute-duration launch window. The first launch attempt was aborted at T-9 seconds in the countdown for a GNC-criteria violation. With insufficient time to recycle, the launch was scrubbed and next attempt was scheduled with a 24-hour delay. This second launch attempt was made on 3 July, and it too was aborted by the onboard computers at the same T minus 9 seconds in the countdown. Having already been pushed to the end of the launch window with no time to recycle, this resulted in a scrub for the second consecutive day. Intelsat 35e could have been rescheduled for a 4 July 2017 launch. However, in the event, the 4 July launch was postponed‚Äîper SpaceX, \\"out of an abundance of caution\\"‚Äîprior to loading propellants. A complete check of the systems both on the rocket and on the pad was performed. Intelsat 35e was successfully launched and placed in orbit on 5 July 2017.

Drainage of the frontal sinus is done through the floor of frontal sinus above the inner canthus. History According to San Diego Museum of Man at San Diego in California, a set of 70 trephined skulls were found in Peru, which were scraped, drilled or cut for medical or spiritual purposes. This procedure was used during prehistoric times.  Technique  In case of refractory frontal sinus disease, the endoscopic access is not possible. A combination of external frontal sinus trephination and intranasal endoscopy is used to approach the frontal sinus. This will help to improve the access to frontal sinus. Frontal sinus trephination also enhances the visualization in anatomy. The incision is made in the medial aspect of eyebrow above, parallel to hair line. A 4‚Äì5 mm diameter hole is drilled into the anterior table of the sinus. The best location of the trephine is the floor of sinus or through brow ridge. If there is possibility of development of osteomyelitis, trephine should be made inferiorly. Precaution is taken not to injure the supraorbital nerve. The pus is cultured and irrigated, and the sinus is cleared with a saline or an antibiotic solution. Extra holes are cut in two pieces of french red Robinson rubber catheter or Silastic tubing. The two tubing pieces are inserted through trephine and sutured. An alternative method is the minitrephine system manufactured by Medtronic-Xomed, in which a metal cannula wedged firmly into an accurately shaped hole is used. Indications In case of acute sinusitis when not responding completely to medical management. During endoscopic sinus surgery, it can be used to identify the frontal sinus opening inside the nasal cavity. Endoscopically, it is detected by visualizing flushed flourescein dye into the nasal cavity. This process is a reliable method to detect the frontal sinus outflow tract. Also while in some cases after endoscopic sinus surgery, frontal sinus trephining is indicated in order to prevent stenosis of frontal sinus infundibulum by passing down a cather into frontal recess. Following endoscopic frontal sinus surgery, frontal sinus trephination can be used for instillation of medications like topical antibiotics and steroid irrigation. Complications The most common complication of frontal sinus trephination are cellulitis, brain injuries due penetration of posterior table of frontal sinus and middle shift orbital complications may also occur. Trephination of frontal sinus is a safe procedure though precautions should be taken. This procedure has its own place, even in endoscopic era. It provides quick relief to patients with acute frontal sinusitis. It is easy to perform. References Nose surgery ","title":"Frontal sinus trephination"},{"id":"51418643","text":"hijra sex worker. A transgender sex worker is a transgender person who works in the sex industry or performs sexual services in exchange for money or other forms of payment. The term transgender refers to an individual whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. A transgender woman is a woman who was assigned male at birth and a transgender man is a man who was assigned female at birth. In general, sex workers appear to be at great risk for serious health problems related to their profession, such as physical and sexual assault, robbery, murder, physical and mental health problems, and drug and alcohol addiction. Though all sex workers are at risk for the problems listed, some studies suggest that sex workers who engage in street-based work have a higher risk for experiencing these issues. Transgender sex workers experience high degrees of discrimination both in and outside of the sex industry and face higher rates of contracting HIV and experiencing violence as a result of their work. In addition, a clear distinction needs to be made between consensual sex work and Sex trafficking where there is a lack of control and personal autonomy.  Overview  Roughly 13 percent of the transgender community reports having participated in the sex industry, according to data from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey. Transgender women and other transfeminine individuals are twice as likely to participate in the sex trade than transmasculine people, but transgender men and transmasculine people constitute about a quarter of all transgender sex workers. These statistics reveal that more trans men participate in the sex industry more than previously expected, especially given that many of the resources and discussions about transgender sex workers focus primarily on transgender women. Other statistics such as lack of family support, job loss due to being transgender, and homelessness were higher among transgender people who had participated in the sex trade compared to those who had not. HIV and other STD rates among transgender sex workers are much higher than those found in transgender non-sex workers. 15.3 percent of those who had done work in the sex industry reported being HIV-positive, whereas only 1.2 percent of non-sex workers reported being HIV-positive. Various groups have been created for the purpose of reducing HIV and STD rates among transgender sex workers. These groups focus on providing resources that transgender people are often unable to access like education, shower facilities, and job placement programs.  Causes and effects  = Poverty = Poverty works both as a cause and an effect of sex work. Sex workers as a whole are a vulnerable population due to obstacles like poverty, poor health, and legal and social barriers. A study that collected information on sex work from transgender women of color in San Francisco reported that for some transgender women sex work is a necessary means of survival. For these women, sex work is a way to get food, shelter, or income in a society that precludes them from many other lines of work. Despite engaging in higher risk activity, transgender sex workers are more likely to receive lower pay than other sex workers. Transgender sex workers with history of homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, mental health issues, violence, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, or drug use are further at risk of being trapped in a cycle of poverty. Lack of economic opportunities outside of the sex work industry and discrimination may lead to transgender people entering sex work in order to generate income for rent, drugs, medicines, hormones, or gender-related surgeries. = Unemployment = In addition to the laws used against sex workers as a whole, laws prohibiting cross-dressing or impersonation of another sex are used to suppress the activity of transgender sex workers. Many of these kinds of laws and ordinances were enforced strictly in the 1970s and 1980s and a vast majority of them have been overturned, but prohibitory laws and ordinances still exist. In the United States, there are no explicit legal protections on a federal level for transgender workers based on gender identity or expression. This lack of legal protection places transgender workers in a position to have higher rates of unemployment and greater risk of poverty. Unemployment rates reported by transgender sex workers were twice those of transgender non-sex workers based on data from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey. A main cause of unemployment among the transgender sex worker population is the compounded stigma of being transgender and being involved in sex work, as both of these populations are unlikely to access health services or job opportunities due to social discrimination. Transgender sex workers of color experience higher rates of unemployment than white sex workers, in addition to being at higher risk for HIV and other STDs. Transgender sex workers often request, and also have difficulty accessing, job training and placement services. Rates of accessing health care, temporary shelter, and financial assistance are all higher than rates of accessing job placement or job trainings. These rates are also affected by race; for example, African American transgender sex workers were less likely to have access to job programs than Latina transgender sex workers.  Health issues  = Sexually transmitted infection risk = Sex workers as a population experience higher risk for various health conditions, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). People engaging in sex exchange services are likely to receive or transmit HIV or other STIs because of the likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behaviors (e.g., sex without a condom, sex with multiple partners) and substance use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that because data for transgender people are not uniformly collected there is a major lack of information about HIV-positive transgender people in the United States. The dearth of information regarding transgender people does not exist solely in the United States, however. There is an urgent need for HIV data for transgender sex workers all around the world, especially in Africa, eastern Europe, and central Asia. This worldwide gap in available information is a result of structural barriers created by the legal structures of different countries and continued criminalization of sex work. According to the CDC, data collected by local health departments and scientists studying transgender communities have shown high levels of HIV and disparities between racial groups. In a systematic review of HIV infection in the United States, African- American transgender women were most likely to test HIV-positive. 56% of African-American transgender women had positive HIV test results compared to 17% of white transgender women and 16% of Hispanic transgender women. Transgender sex workers, especially transgender women, have a higher risk of carrying or contracting HIV. From the data collected it has been estimated that as many as 1-in-4 transgender female sex workers are HIV-positive. HIV testing programs and HIV prevention programs for transgender individuals could potentially reduce the risk for infection while also helping HIV-positive transgender sex workers access health care. Transgender sex workers worldwide are at higher risk of contracting HIV and other STIs as well. In a study on sex workers in Jakarta, Indonesia, waria, or third gender people, were found to have HIV rates over 5 times the rates of cisgender male sex workers and syphilis rates almost 10 times the rates present in the cisgender male sex worker community. The results of this study have implications for the wider population in Jakarta as well, as many of the sex workers interviewed reported bisexual activity. Sex workers in China are often detained in \\"re-education through labor\\" (RTL) centers that focus on moral and vocational training. The number of detained sex workers has been on the rise due to the recent uptick in HIV rates among heterosexual men. However, incarceration in an RTL center makes accessing information about HIV and STIs difficult, mostly due to social stigma of imprisonment and sex work in general, which only further increases rates of HIV and STIs in sex workers. = Health care services = Experiences of discrimination in a health care setting can delay a sex worker's willingness to seek medical care in the future. Refusing to seek medical treatment for seemingly minor medical issues may lead to initially innocuous issues becoming more serious and more difficult to treat. Insensitivity from health care professionals has been cited as a reason that sex education and medical services are not accessed. Reports of insensitive behavior among health care providers (e.g., misgendering, using the wrong name, etc.) suggest that some services are lacking in terms of provision of culturally sensitive interactions and possible provisions of trans health care. In addition to the health care problems experienced by transgender men and women, traditional health care plans do not always cover the costs relative to transitioning, which may lead to men and women resorting to alternative methods to pay for transitioning or force them to seek out unsafe methods of making these changes such as using hormones bought off the street or sharing needles while injecting hormones. Various methods have been implemented to help transgender sex workers gain information about HIV and safe sex practices. The use of mobile outreach units in Lima, Peru was effective in reaching transgender women and identifying HIV-positive transgender women who did not previously know their status. The Sisters program in Thailand, which primarily serves kathoeys, emphasizes the use of peer support networks and outreach efforts and has increased condom usage in kathoey sex worker populations with clients. Despite this success, however, there was no increase in condom usage with casual or long-term partners. While there has been success with implementing HIV prevention programs in different countries around the world, a lack of information about HIV programs for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and especially transgender sex workers limits the extent to which effective, long-term solutions can be produced. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is an effective method of preventing HIV contraction when taken regularly and used in combination with condoms. However, barriers to accessing general health care prevent transgender sex workers from accessing PrEP and other HIV-preventing medications as well. Demand for PrEP exists within the transgender sex worker community but low awareness of the drug, cost of the medication, and confusion about where to get PrEP create an environment in which sex workers cannot effectively access it. A study on PrEP usage in the men who have sex with men and transgender women sex worker communities recommended increasing access to PrEP by spreading more accurate information about PrEP as well as providing ways to get PrEP for a cheaper price.  Discrimination  An animation showing the current status of legal protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Transgender and sex worker populations have difficulty accessing health care services due to social stigma. This difficulty is further compounded at the intersection of these two populations. A survey of sex workers, which included transgender responses, in four African countries, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Uganda, and South Africa, reported that denial of treatment for injuries associated with physical or sexual assault as well as general public services was common. Recent legal moves within the United States have been made to legalize this kind of discrimination within the health care sector with the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA). In the United States, transgender people do not always have job protections as anti-discrimination bills vary between states, which means that transgender people can lose their job on the basis of their gender identity. Due to these lack of protections, transgender people are at a higher risk of experiencing unemployment and finding employment in unofficial markets like the sex work industry. In Mexico, transgender sex workers are not included in official HIV prevention materials despite being part of a population that is at a very high risk of contracting HIV. Many factors contribute to this higher risk, such as socioeconomic status, the context in which sex work takes place, and the stigma that is associated with sex work and transgender identity as a whole. However, programs in Mexico that aim for lower rates of HIV and other STIs do not address these root causes directly, instead taking an approach that focuses on quick action by providing condoms and other prevention measures.  Physical and sexual violence  Transgender people are likely to experience high levels of violence and harassment from strangers, people in the home, or people they know. They are also at a higher risk of being victims of sexual or physical assault multiple times. There is also a high prevalence of sexual assault and rape starting at a young age. In the United States, the most common finding across self-surveys and needs assessments is that about 50% of transgender people report unwanted sexual activity. The majority of perpetrators of sexual violence are people who are known to the victim, including partners and family members. Participating in the sex industry comes with a higher risk of experiencing violence. Sex workers work in a variety of settings and are often open to exploitation, harassment, and physical and sexual abuse from clients, managers, and police.\\"Addressing the links between gender-based violence and HIV in the Great Lakes region\\" (PDF). UNESCO. United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. 2013. According to self-reported surveys from sex workers in the U.S. most unwanted sexual violence has come from clients. This violence may be motivated by perpetrators hatred or negative attitudes toward transgender people. Self reported surveys have become a major form of data collection on sex worker violence in part due to research by Departments of Health or social service organizations. Since these institutions have a large focus on data pertaining to sexual activity there are more reports relative to sexual violence in comparison to other forms of violence. These experiences are not always reported to the police which can affect crime reporting rates, which may be due to mistrust of the police or fear of discrimination. Transgender sex workers around the world experience high levels of police violence in particular. Sex workers in Nepal, Mexico, and other countries often report verbal and physical harassment at the hands of police officers as well as sexual violence in some extreme cases. International human rights guidelines do not provide explicit protections for sex workers but also do not explicitly exclude sex workers, meaning that sex workers facing police brutality are victims of human rights violations. In some cases, police brutality works against the push for limiting the spread of STIs as they confiscate the condoms that sex workers have on them or refuse to use a condom when having sex with them.

Saueressig was the Humane Society of Missouri's Chief of Staff for 55 years. She was born in Nuremberg, Germany and graduated from the University of Munich Veterinary College, class of 1953. She was the only female in her class. She came to St. Louis, MO and was hired as a veterinarian for the Humane Society of Missouri. She insisted on raising the standards at her clinic- ensuring surgical instruments were sanitized properly, increasing cleanliness standards for the animals, and insisting on modern x-ray equipment. She was named their Chief of Staff ten years later in 1965. She is accredited with playing a major role in the Humane Society of Missouri's success. It is one of the largest operating practices in the Midwest today. She campaigned for spaying and neutering animals and had a column in the local newspaper to help educate and improve the local community. In 1972, she claimed the award of \\"Woman Veterinarian of the Year\\" by the national organization American Veterinary Medical Association.  Life and education  = Early life = Suzanne Saueressig was born in Nuremberg, Germany. She was the first of four siblings. Her great-grandfather built their family home directly behind his construction building. It was a five story apartment building. Her early education was done at a Catholic school, despite her objections with the school dress code. Her love for animals started at a young age as she had cats and dogs as pets growing up. One day after her cat had gone missing, Saueressig suspected the maid as the cause. She placed mice in the maid's dresser and the cat reappeared the next day. At the age of 17, Saueressig enrolled in a typing class. The first session she attended the school was bombed. This moment led her to quit the typing program and instead pursue a career as a nurse. During her first semester in nursing school, she once again was involved in a bombing. This time she suffered a concussion. She and her classmates at the nursing school were drafted into the army. In 1945-1946 she was held as a prisoner of war by the United States in Nuremberg Germany for about a year. During this time in Nuremberg, the Nuremberg Trials were taking place- the most notable being the Trial of Major War Criminals. During Hitler's reign, Nuremberg was a popular site for Nazi propaganda and rallies. = Veterinary education = Acceptance into a veterinary school was no easy feat, especially as a female. At the time, the college favored war heroes and this may have attributed to her successful acceptance into the University of Munich.She graduated from the University of Munich Veterinary college in 1953. Out of 90 students in her graduating class, she was the only female. Despite this, her parents were not pleased at her choice to become a veterinarian. They believed working on animals was unbecoming for a young lady and that handling animals was dirty labor. After graduating, she did a year- long research study in an internship studying salmonella in mollusks. This earned her a master's degree magna cum laude after completing her doctoral dissertation in 1954 at the University of Munich. During her schooling, the opportunity to work on large animals like horses was very limited due to World War II. Most of the horses in Germany belonged to aristocracy and were considered precious at the time.  Career at the Humane Society  Originally, Saueressig traveled to America to spend a year learning American veterinary methods. Saueressig moved to St. Louis and first had to wait five years before allowed to practice in the United States. First, she had to undergo the process to become a United States Citizen and become licensed by the state. She was then hired at the Humane Society of Missouri's clinic in 1955. At the time, the clinic was very small and had only a few other staff members. One of the staff members was a third year veterinary student- Richard Riegel. While she was working her way to a higher position at the clinic, Riegel and Saueressig fell in love and married in 1956. Saueressig was soon placed in charge of the facility. From the start of working there, she insisted on raising the clinic's standards. She also insisted on sterile surgery equipment, using modern day technologies such as x-ray equipment, and clean cages. She would hide small newspaper comics on the bottom of animals' cages overnight and check to make sure they were removed the next morning as a way to ensure the staff was properly cleaning the cages. She is accredited with being the primary reason the Humane Society of Missouri's clinic is one of the largest in the Midwest today. The facility now annually receives around 80,000 patients and performs 17,00 surgeries. She became Chief of Staff in 1965 and used her power to continue to expand the facility and raise the standards.  Other achievements  Saueressig was very involved in improving her community. From the beginning, she was a huge advocate for spaying and neutering pets and had a campaign to raise public awareness for the spay/neuter project. She served on veterinary and community organizations and mentored many successful veterinarians. She had a column in the newspaper St. Louis Globe-Democrat which was entitled \\"Ask the Pet Doctor\\" and was ran weekly from 1979-1985. She answered many community member questions about their pet's care and helped spread awareness this way. = Awards = She received the national award \\"Woman Veterinarian of the Year\\" from the Women's Veterinary Medical Association in 1972. The organization transitioned into a foundation, Association for Women Veterinarians Foundation, and continues its awards and scholarships through the American Veterinary Medicine Association. Her community recognized her hard work in 1983 and titled her a Leader of Distinction and was added to the YWCA Metro St. Louis Academy of Leaders.  Legacy  Saueressig died on February 8, 2013. She did not leave any children behind. Her husband died two months later on April 30, 2013. She was a mentor to many veterinarians and an inspiration to her supporters. Kathy Warnick, the president of the Humane Society of Missouri at the time of Saueressig's death, accredited Dr. Saueressig with provided care to over a million pets in need.

It is dedicated to Saint John the New of Suceava. The church is located in the eastern part of the city, on TƒÉtƒÉra»ôi Hill. An earlier church existed on the site; it was built of wood by the pious daughter of a boyar in memory of the fact that in 1402, during the reign of Alexander the Good, Saint John's relics stopped in the area on the way into the city. History at the Nicori»õƒÉ parish site The present church was built between 1626 and 1629, Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Jude»õul Ia»ôi on the ruins of the old one. Its ktitor was hetman NicoarƒÉ, adviser and brother- in-law to Prince Miron Barnovschi-MovilƒÉ; the co-founder was his wife Todosia. Two legends surround the building of the church. One holds that Miron asked NicoarƒÉ to supervise construction of the Barnovschi Church. Finding out that the latter was sparing with materials, intending to use leftovers in order to build his own church, the prince ordered him sealed alive into the walls of his church. Another states that the prince was envious of NicoarƒÉ's church and thus refused his permission for it to be blessed. At the time, the eastern part of Ia»ôi was covered in thick forests, and woodcutters lived on the edges; the church was built for their benefit. It was also used by monks, to whom Prince Miron granted estates and villages throughout Moldavia. The establishment was a dependency of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Acquiring a certain fame, it was visited by Macarios III Zaim, the Patriarch of Antioch, during the 17th century. Following the 1863 Secularization of monastic estates in Romania, the monks left and it became a parish church. According to N. A. Bogdan, the church was used by two guilds: the makers of bows and arrows, and carpenters. The graveyard was shut down in 1876. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site The structure is trefoil in shape, built of stone and brick. The spire resembles those of early Moldavian churches. In 1814, the archimandrite of the day restored the church, adding a closed foyer with a door and four windows, on top of which a bell tower was built. There are four bells, one of which was cast at Bra»ôov in 1790. The exterior decoration is sparse, confined to niches and buttresses. The nave has an arched ceiling with an octagonal gap for the spire, while the altar space is a quarter-sphere. In 1926, part of the parish house was rebuilt and the interior painted; the church suffered damage during the 1940 Vrancea earthquake. During the subsequent repairs, the upper part of the walls was whitewashed; the painting was not of high quality, as can be discerned from what remains. By contrast, the 19th-century iconostasis is beautifully carved and features five rows of well-crafted icons. Other valuable objects in the church include two Gospel books, one decorated in silver, another in silvered velvet; the royal doors; the stand for the Virgin Mary's icon; icons of Ss. Barbara and Charalambos; old liturgical books finely typed. To the south of the church, there is a building that once served as the archimandrite's residence, dating to 1858; later a primary school, it is now a kindergarten. No old inscriptions survive, only one in Greek above the entrance recording the 1814 expansion. The church underwent repairs in 1968, when the structure was consolidated and the interior painting remaining after the 1950 whitewashing was covered up. Further repairs took place in 1977-1978, and sporadically since 1996. It is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

He was known for his ability to form pro-British relationships with the local people. He was in favour of a vigorous programme of expansion from the coast into the interior in response to French activity in the Sahel region, at times in opposition to Colonial Office policy. Early years Samuel Rowe was born on 23 March 1835 at Macclesfield, Cheshire. He was the youngest son of George Hambly Rowe, a Wesleyan minister, and Lydia Ramshall of London. He was educated at private schools, then studied medicine under Joseph Denton of Leicester and others. He qualified as a doctor in 1856. He was appointed to the army medical staff in 1862 and assigned to Lagos in West Africa. Rowe married Susannah, daughter of William Gatliff of Hawker Hall, Whitby, Yorkshire. They had one son, who died young. Colonial surgeon Rowe arrived in Lagos in July 1862 and was soon appointed a judicial assessor in the chief magistrate's court and a slave commissioner, a difficult position. He afterwards became colonial surgeon. Rowe got on well with the local people, who would later call him \\"Old Red Breeches\\", and was made a commandant of the eastern districts. He was appointed special commissioner to make a treaty with the town of Epe in the Ijebu Kingdom. He returned home on leave in July 1864, and continued his studies in Aberdeen, graduating in medicine and surgery in 1865. Rowe returned to West Africa in 1866 and stayed in Cape Coast Castle. He was again made colonial surgeon and superintendent of the Hausas in Lagos in 1867. In 1869 he also was a magistrate and clerk of the council of Lagos. He was promoted staff surgeon in the army on 4 July 1870. He returned for a stay in England, then was dispatched to the Gold Coast in January 1872. On 1 March 1973 he was appointed surgeon-major. He may have advised Nathaniel King and Sylvester Cole, members of the Sierra Leone elite, to study medicine at Aberdeen. King graduated in 1876 and returned to practice in Lagos, while Cole graduated in 1883 and entered government service in the Gold Coast. In 1873 Rowe was involved in action against the Ashantis and twice saw action near Elmina, for which he was decorated with a medal and clasp. He was appointed to the Ashanti expeditionary force under Captain John Hawley Glover. Through his experience in working with the local people he helped to enlist Yoruba volunteers. He was appointed C.M.G. in 1874 for his services in the Anglo-Ashanti wars. In 1875, he became colonial surgeon of the Gold Coast colony. Rowe retired from the army on 4 December 1876 with the honorary rank of brigade-surgeon. Colonial administrator =The Gambia= While still in the army, Rowe was in turn head of the governments of the Gambia and Sierra Leone. The Gambia was governed from Sierra Leone during this period. Surgeon Major Rowe was appointed administrator of the Gambia in June 1875. The former administrator, C. H. Kortright, had left the Gambia on 12 February 1875 and Captain Henry T. M. Cooper was acting as administrator. Samuel Rowe arrived on 2 July 1875, but transferred to Sierra Leone the next day, leaving Cooper to continue as acting administrator. Rowe left Bathurst to take office in Freetown, Sierra Leone, as acting governor. Cooper died on 9 January 1877 and on 30 March 1877 Surgeon Major Valesius S. Gouldsbury arrived to take office as administrator. =Sierra Leone= In Rowe's first tour of duty as governor of Sierra Leone in 1875‚Äì81 he was supported by the Colonial Office in pursuing a policy of aggressive colonial intervention in the interior. He led two successful expeditions against the Sherbro people. On 29 April 1887 Rowe returned to the Gambia as administrator, replacing the acting administrator Gilbert T. Carter. During his brief term of office various local rulers agreed to accept British protection. On 12 June 1887 Rowe was promoted to governor-in-chief of the West Africa settlements. On 27 November 1887 he left the Gambia and was replaced by T. Risely Griffith as acting administrator. While governor-in-chief of the British West African Settlements he continued to act as governor of Sierra Leone. As governor in chief he opposed cession of the Gambia, and strongly opposed the Colonial Office police of giving in to the demands from the French. He planned the expedition by administrator V. S. Gouldsbury to the upper Gambia River in 1881. On 20 April 1880 Rowe was made K.C.M.G. (Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George). He was replaced in Sierra Leone by A. E. Havelock in 1881. The acting governor got news of Havelock's appointment from a foreign consul some weeks before this was confirmed by the Colonial Office. =Gold Coast and Lagos= On 28 January 1881 Rowe became governor of the Gold Coast and Lagos. This was a better-paid position than Sierra Leone. He replaced W. Brandford Griffith. He managed to avoid another war with the Ashantis through his diplomacy. In March 1883 Rowe issued an ordinance establishing registry offices for instruments affecting land in the Gold Coast Colony. In 1884 he was replaced by W. A. G. Young. =West Africa Settlements= On 30 December 1884 Rowe was again appointed governor of the West Africa settlements in response to a special petition of the traders and others. Rowe took office in 1885, replacing A. E. Havelock. During his second term, following the Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì85, British activity in the interior increased and there was growing competition with the French, who had colonial ambitions in the same region. Rowe was given enlarged powers to annex land to the north and east of Sierra Leone. On 11 November 1885 he signed the Havelock Draft Convention, which fixed the northwest boundary of Liberia at the southeast bank of the Mano River, making Sierra Leone and Liberia coterminous. In 1886 Rowe was made an LL.D. by Aberdeen University. In August 1887 the Secretary of State for the Colonies said he had received a report from Rowe saying the chiefs of Jarra and Fogni, who had been suffering from raids by slave traders, had offered to place their territories under British protection. Rowe's health began to fail in 1887, in part due to worries about the advance of the French in the region. On his way home to recuperate he died at Madeira on 28 August 1888. He was replaced as governor by J. M. Maltby.

It had been previously dedicated to San Giusto. The church once had a venerated processional crucifix carried in town in 1399 by the flagellant Confraternity dei Bianchi.

In addition to the food and drink, the cafe offered dial-up internet services and email accounts through their fly.net web portal. Computer and internet usage was billed at $5 per half-hour. The business idea was inspired by Japanese video game cafes that McGinnis had frequented when he lived in Japan during the 1980s. During the internet's early days when the medium was still mostly unexplored, @Cafe tried to present ‚Äúthe internet at its best,‚Äù paying $9,000 a month for a dedicated T1 line and supplying powerful PC or Mac computers at every table. At the time of @Cafe's opening, the first Netscape browser had just been released; a technological advance that introduced the internet to a more general computer user. @Cafe soon became a center for patrons curious about the internet, such as famous hacker, Phiber Optik, and was also embraced by New York's burgeoning technology sector known as Silicon Alley. @Cafe also made connections with early internet pioneers The WELL, hosting their ten-year anniversary party a few weeks after they opened and was also an early meet up location of the Women's Technology advocacy group Webgrrls. @Cafe was one of the first businesses that was predicated on monetizing what had previously been the domain of academics and programmers. When it opened, @Cafe was the largest internet-based cafe in New York City and was the only internet cafe with a full kitchen and bar. It played host to a number of high-profile events, including a failed online meeting between the New York and Boston mayors Rudy Giuliani and Thomas Menino, the launch of the Rolling Stones Voodoo Lounge CD- ROM, The Wall Street Journal's Interactive Edition website premier, a Donna Karan men's fragrance and website debut, and a global and interactive New Year's Eve party on December 31, 1995 with the internet cafes CyberJava in Los Angeles, California and CyberSmith in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Corporate clients MTV, MasterCard, IBM and Budweiser also held technology events at the cafe. The cafe also played host to an early web/television hybrid program called \\"Encarta On the Record.\\" The monthly program was moderated by journalist Linda Ellerbee, produced by Microsoft and Ellerbee's production company Lucky Duck and combined a live roundtable discussion with web-based resources through the Encarta web portal. The web audience could ask questions to the panel in real time, the audio of the discussion could be streamed and video images of the proceedings were updated every 8 seconds. In contemporary interviews, Barnes and McGinnis spoke of opening a number of internet-based cafes around the world, where technology novices and professionals could experience the full potential of the internet. Despite media and public interest, @Cafe never broke even and closed in 1996 before additional locations or franchises could be opened.

He was instrumental in procuring the publication of the secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance between Argentina, the Empire of Brazil and Uruguay. Early life Lettsom was born into a Quaker family at Fulham in March 1805. His paternal grandfather John Coakley Lettsom was a famous physician, philanthropist and abolitionist who held that sea- bathing was good for public health. His maternal grandfather ‚àí with whom he lived in his youth ‚àí was Sir William Garrow the celebrated criminal defender, afterwards a judge, who introduced the phrase \\"presumed innocent until proven guilty\\" into the common law and whose life inspired the television drama series Garrow's Law. Lettsom was educated at Westminster School and Cambridge University. Literary acquaintance As an undergraduate at Cambridge University Lettsom befriended the author William Makepeace Thackeray and was the (or an) editor of The Snob in which some of Thackeray's earliest work appeared; Lettsom has been identified as the character TapewormPresumably because his grandfather Dr Lettsom produced a cure for tapeworm (by dosing the patients with paraffin). in Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair. Lettsom was well acquainted with the cartoonist George Cruikshank, illustrator of the early works of Charles Dickens. Lettsom was a contributor to various literary periodicals under the pseudonym Dr. Bulgardo. An extract from Lettsom's book on mineralogy. Scientist Lettsom was a competent scientist in an age where it was still possible for an amateur to be so. He was best known as the joint author of Greg and Lettsom's Manual of the Mineralogy of Great Britain and Ireland, which was the most complete and accurate work that had appeared on the mineralogy of the British Isles. But his scientific interests were wider, and he corresponded with the most eminent workers in spectroscopy. He was a member of the London Electrical Society and the author of several papers on geological, electrical and spectroscopic subjects. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1849. In that year he communicated an experiment in bioelectricity: by making a wound in a finger and inserting the electrode of a galvanometer, while placing the other electrode in contact with an unwounded finger, a current was observed to flow. Lettsom observed that the experiment was repeatable for he had tried it himself. In 1857 while on diplomatic service in Mexico he sent to the Royal Entomological Society of London some seeds which, when put in a warm place, became \\"very lively\\". The grub responsible had not been investigated scientifically before, wrote Lettsom, and he asked the Society to do so. These were the celebrated Mexican jumping beans. During his appointment as Consul-General and Charg√© d'Affaires to the Republic of Uruguay, he carried a 9 inches Henry Fitz telescope for astronomical observation at the southern hemisphere. Due to unknown problems, he sent the telescope back to New York to be checked and adjusted by the telescope maker. The telescope was received by Lewis Rutherford, pioneer astrophotographer and spectroscopist also associated of the Royal Astronomical Society, who helped Henry Fitz on this tasks. The telescope was left in Uruguay and is in use until today by the Amateur Astronomer Association. First page of the letter sent by Lewis Rutherford to Lettsom, April 10th 1863. Diplomat After being called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn he entered the diplomatic service. After postings in Berlin, Munich (1831), Washington (1840), Turin (1849) and Madrid (1850) he was appointed secretary to the Legation at Mexico (1854) and became the Charg√© d'affaires. In the unreformed British diplomatic service there were no examinations; candidates were appointed by the influence of political friends. This caused criticism. In the House of Commons on 22 May 1855 the motion was > That it is the opinion of this House that the complete Revision of our > Diplomatic Establishment recommended in the Report of the Select Committee > of 1850 on Official Salaries should be carried into effect. In this debate Lettsom was used as a case in point to illustrate the defects of the unreformed system. It has been noted that Lettsom, \\"who had invariably conducted himself to the satisfaction of those who employed him\\", received one of the slowest promotions in the diplomatic service. A diplomat was expected to be a gentleman and to have a private income whereby he could receive unpaid diplomatic appointments. Hence nine of the twenty-three years of Lettsom's service were unsalaried; promotion was slow. This glacial treatment did not apply, however, to those who had powerful political friends, for they were soon appointed to agreeable capitals at enormous salaries. The motion was carried by 112 votes to 57, Mr Otway MP remarking that \\"The person who had shown himself to be the fittest man, whether he was the son of a Peer or a tailor, should be chosen\\". While in Mexico the British government suspended relations with that country on Lettsom's representation, and he was the object of an attempted assassination. Between 1859 and 1869 Lettsom was appointed Consul-General and Charg√© d'Affaires to the Republic of Uruguay. =Treaty of the Triple Alliance= Parliamentary paper. Lettsom tells London he is getting a copy of the secret Treaty.. In 1864 and early 1865 Paraguayan forces under the orders of Francisco Solano L√≥pez seized Brazilian and Argentine shipping and invaded the provinces of the Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) and Corrientes (Argentina). On 1 May 1865 Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay signed the Treaty of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay. By Article XVIII of the Treaty its provisions were to be kept secret until its \\"principal object\\"The deposition of L√≥pez or (on another view) the demolition of the Fortress of Humait√°. should be obtained. One of its provisions concerned the acquisition by Argentina of large tracts of territory then in dispute between it and Paraguay. Lettsom was not satisfied about this and surreptitiously obtained a copy of the Treaty from the Uruguayan diplomat Dr Carlos de Castro. He forwarded it to London and the British government ordered it to be translated into English and published to Parliament. When the text became available in South America there was outrage in several quarters, some because of the Treaty's content, others because it had been published at all. Lettsom retired from the diplomatic service in 1869. He never married. He died of acute bronchitis on 14 December 1887.

After Himmler's arrival, when Brandt learns that the pastor has revealed Mieke's identity, he urges her to flee. She refuses, insisting that she has a mission. Himmler extends to Wilhelm an invitation from Adolf Hitler to return to his former throne in Berlin. He then meets with Brandt and Dietrich, informing them that the invitation is a bluff, intended to draw out and execute anti-Nazi monarchists. Hermine is overjoyed at the thought of finally becoming Empress of Germany but Wilhelm, troubled by Himmler's boasts about the euthanasia of disabled children, remains unsureeven when Colonel von Ilsemann speaks to him of how Wilhelm can become \\"a restraining influence.\\" When Brandt asks von Ilsemann whether an officer can serve something other than his country, the Colonel replies, \\"First you must decide what is your country and if it even still exists.\\" Brandt pauses, then tells von Ilsemann of Himmler's plans for the Kaiser's supporters. Mieke completes her mission by delivering to Wilhelm a message from Winston Churchill, offering the Kaiser political asylum in Great Britain and the throne of a defeated Germany after the war. Wilhelm refuses, having decided that he is finally at peace with the loss of his throne. As the Gestapo closes in on Mieke, Brandt devises an escape plan. Wilhelm, Mieke, and Brandt escape in a van as the Kaiser pretends to have a heart attack. In the process, Brandt kills Dietrich and another SS officer. Mieke asks Brandt to flee with her, fearing he will be executed for the murders. Brandt insists that he has a duty to Germany and has a good alibi. As Mieke departs, Brandt asks Mieke to marry him. She tells Brandt yes and to find her after the war, then she flees into the woods. Some time later, Brandt is working at a desk in Berlin. He is delivered a package, which contains a book of Friedrich Nietzsche's writings that Mieke had once shown him. Inside is written a London address. In London, Mieke is seated on a park bench when she is informed that Churchill is ready to see her. Rising, Mieke puts her hand on her belly, revealing that she is pregnant. In Utrecht, von Ilsemann informs Wilhelm that Brandt has called from Berlin with wonderful news. Realizing this means Mieke has escaped to Britain, Wilhelm is overjoyed.

Preparations  The theme of the ceremony was \\"Todo Mundo tem um Cora√ß√£o\\" (\\"Everybody Has a Heart\\"); writer and director Marcelo Rubens Paiva stated that the ceremony would focus upon \\"humanity, on the human condition, on feelings, difficulties, solidarity, love, heart\\" and \\"evoke emotion, laughs and tears\\". At least 2,500 people were involved in the ceremony, including 500 creative professionals and 2,000 volunteers. On 2 September 2016, director Fred Gelli revealed that the ceremony would feature U.S. Paralympic snowboarder and Dancing with the Stars contestant Amy Purdy performing a contemporary, Samba-inspired dance routine with a \\"surprise partner\\". Amidst larger financial concerns surrounding the Games, fellow director Fl√°vio Machado affirmed that the ceremony's budget was fiscally responsible and was \\"enough to do what we wanted to create\\", adding that \\"It wasn't a problem and it's not going to be an excuse\\". International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach was absent from the opening ceremony, as he had prior obligations to attend the state funeral of former West German president Walter Scheel. This marked the first time since 1984 that the current president of the IOC did not attend the opening ceremonies of a Paralympic Games. IOC delegate to disability sports Sam Ramsamy attended the ceremony in place of Bach.  Synopsis  = Pre-show entertainment = Prior to the ceremony, the Rio 2016 mascots Vinicius and Tom were seen participating in a parody of Gisele B√ºndchen's runway walk segment from the Olympics' opening ceremony, with Vinicius dressed similarly to B√ºndchen. = Prologue = Aaron Fotheringham enters the stadium on a ramp. The ceremony opened with a pre-recorded segment, featuring Philip Craven, president of the International Paralympic Committee. After his direct flight to Rio was cancelled, Craven instead flies to Bel√©m, travelling on his wheelchair through various Brazilian cities en route to Rio de Janeiro, and visiting the Christ the Redeemer statue before entering the stadium. A countdown from 10 was conducted using numbers unfolded from the upper deck of the stadium. For the conclusion of the countdown, wheelchair stunt performer Aaron \\"Wheelz\\" Fotheringham rode down a ramp, jumping through a large numeral \\"0\\" and landing a backflip into an air cushion, which is a reference to Canadian snowboarder Johnny Lyall sliding down a ramp and leaping through a set of Olympic rings in the Vancouver 2010 Olympics opening ceremony. The first segment of the cultural portion of the ceremony paid tribute to the invention of the wheel, featuring samba circles and performers riding the stage in wheelchairs. The next segment paid tribute to Rio's beaches, including performers \\"surfing\\" on skateboards on the projection floor. Appearing in the segment was Brazilian Paralympic swimmer Daniel Dias. It was followed by a segment honouring African influence on Brazilian culture. The Hino Nacional Brasileiro was performed on piano by Jo√£o Carlos Martins, while performers arranged themselves on the stadium floor to form the flag of Brazil. = Parade of Nations = The Belarusian delegation at the Parade of Nations carrying both the Belarusian and Russian flags. Delegations representing 161 National Paralympic Committees marched into the stadium, led by the Independent athletes. Each team was accompanied by a woman carrying a puzzle piece-shaped sign with the country's name written on in Brazilian Portuguese; the other side of each piece contained photos of the athletes participating in the Games. In protest of the banning of Russia from the Games over a doping scandal, Belarusian Ministry of Sport official Andrey Fomochkin was seen carrying the flag of Russia while entering the stadium; the flag was confiscated, and Fomochkin's credentials were revoked by the IPC for violating the policy forbidding political protests and gestures. As countries entered, the puzzle pieces were assembled on the stadium floor to create a mosaic of the human heart using the photos. = Opening = The entry of athletes was followed by opening remarks by Rio 2016 Organizing Committee head Carlos Arthur Nuzman, who invited athletes to \\"play fair, abide by the rules and, most of all, have fun doing what you do best\\". The crowd booed at Nuzman after he thanked local governments for their contributions to the Games. Nuzman's speech was followed by a speech by IPC president Philip Craven, in which he called upon spectators to \\"see the true meaning of sport and the true definition of ability\\", explaining that \\"in a country which has faced major challenges of late, Paralympians will switch your focus from perceived limitations, to a world full of possibility and endless opportunity. They will surprise you, inspire and excite you, but most of all they will change you.\\" The Games were officially opened by President of Brazil Michel Temer; in the wake of the formal impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, Temer was also booed at. = Cultural segments = Amy Purdy dances alongside a robotic arm. A segment representing vision called \\"Beyond Vision\\" created by the Brazilian light artist Muti Randolphhttps://vimeo.com/188209982 featured dancers dressed in black while carrying white light sticks, followed by a routine by a pair of partially-sighted dancers aided by a tactile floor. This was followed by segments paying tribute to the sports that would be featured during the Games. The Paralympic emblem was formed on the arena floor, followed by the entry and raising of the Paralympic flag; the flag was brought in by members of the Associa√ß√£o de Assist√™ncia √† Crian√ßa Deficiente (an organization for disabled youth), and a montage of Paralympic athletes was played while the flag was raised. Following the taking of oaths, dancer and Paralympic snowboarder Amy Purdy, dressed in a 3D Printed Dress designed by fashion designer Danit Peleg, performed a dance routine with a KUKA robotic arm, which symbolized the co-existence of humans and technology. = Lighting of the cauldron = Silva after lighting the Paralympic cauldron As rain fell over the Maracan√£, the Paralympic flame was brought into the stadium by the Brazilian pioneers in the Parasports. Firstly, sprinter Ant√¥nio Delfino who has won 2 gold medals in the 2004 Summer Paralympics, passed the torch to M√°rcia Malsar‚Äîthe first Brazilian gold medalist at the Paralympics in 1984 Summer Paralympics in New York City. Malsar slipped and fell on the rain- soaked ground, dropping the torch. After successfully recovering from the fall, Malsar passed the torch to Brazilian paralympic legend √Ådria Santos, who has won 13 paralympic medals. Santos then passed the flame to the final torchbearer, Brazilian paralympic legend Clodoaldo Silva. The cauldron was located at the top of a flight of stairs, which slid apart to reveal a series of ramps for Silva's wheelchair. Silva ascended the ramps and lit the Paralympic cauldron, which was the same as that of the 2016 Olympics, but adapted in a lower module. The lighting was followed by a musical performance by singer Seu Jorge.

It is dedicated to Saints John Chrysostom and Theodore of Amasea. The first church on the site was a small wooden one with stone foundations, erected between 1563 and 1564. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site This was built by Prince »òtefan IX Tom»ôa, who in the early 17th century was preoccupied by the development of that part of the city, then on its periphery. Short history at the Zlataust parish site Eventually, the old church deteriorated. The present church dates to 1683, Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Jude»õul Ia»ôi according to the inscription, and was built in thirty days by George Ducas, near the end of his third reign in Moldavia. In order to fulfill a promise, he put it under the control of church authorities from Argyrokastro in exchange for Hlincea Monastery, which he placed under CetƒÉ»õuia Monastery, recently founded by him. An alternate date is late 1682: on April 20 the following year, he was obliged to accompany the Ottomans to the Battle of Vienna, and was taken prisoner by the Poles in December, while returning from the campaign. Oddly, the inscription mentions George's son Constantine, who was only 6 or 7 years old in 1682, as well as his wife Maria. His marriage took place only when he ascended the throne in 1693, implying that the plaque was placed at that point, when the church was already a decade old. The north wall of the old foyer features a painting of George holding the church, his wife Anastasia, their three daughters and their son. Inside the church, there is a list of names to be mentioned during the liturgy, beginning with Prince Eustratie Dabija and his wife. The churchyard used to be Ia»ôi's main cemetery, and some of the gravestones remain in the yard and inside the church. In the foyer, added later, there is a stone for a vornic who died in 1858 and his family. Another family has a stone from 1877. The grave of musician Barbu LƒÉutaru was discovered during an excavation in 1968. The road on which the church is located is named after the latter. Writer Ionel Teodoreanu grew up in a house adjoining the church, and several of his writings deal with the vicinity. Notable architectural features include the church's stone walls and its tall bell tower, which has a hiding place for religious objects, to be used in cases of danger. The church, which was enlarged in 1855, is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, together with LƒÉutaru's grave.

Since 1902 she appeared in the directory All Petersburg (–í–µ—Å—å –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥), sometimes as Klokacheva and others as Klakacheva, with different addresses. Since 1906 she lived in Sergui√©vskaya street that changed its name to Tchaikovsky street in 1923. From 1917 on, her name disappears from the directory. Since 1922 she lived in Pavlovsk.

In 1942 and 1943, the Spanish Blue Division, participating in the Siege of Leningrad, had a field dressing station in Pavlovsk. Klokacheva made charcoal portraits of some of the Spanish military physicians on assignment there. Their families hold two of these portraits in Spain. The date and place of her death are unknown.  Artistic career  She studied painting at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg (–ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è X—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤); during 1891 and 1892 with Pavel Chistiakov and then with Pavel Kovalevsky (). In 1899 she went to Munich to study with the Slovene painter Anton A≈æbe and with Franz von Lenbach. Klokacheva took part in some of the exhibitions of the Peredvizhniki (The Wanderers or The Itinerants) group whose best known member was Ilya Repin. In 1901 she was entitled \\"artist‚Äù (Russian: —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∞) for her picture ‚ÄúBehind the scenes‚Äù (–ó–∞ –∫—É–ª–∏—Å–∞–º–∏). The Academy had accepted full membership of women just in 1873. In 1907, the Academy acquired her work At the circus; her picture Hard days and a portrait of her friend, the art historian Olga Bazankur (–û–ª—å–≥–∞ –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –ë–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∫—É—Ä-–®—Ç–µ–π–Ω—Ñ–µ–ª—å–¥) were exhibited in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. In 1909 she took part in the spring exhibition at the Imperial Academy of Arts with her work ‚ÄúSatyr and nymph‚Äù. Klokacheva participated in the artistic circles of her time in Saint Petersburg; she was friend with the writers Nadezhda Aleksandrovna Lukhmanova (–ù–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –õ—É—Ö–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞) and Evdokiia Nagr√≥dskaia.

It stands on a rock above the eponymous town of Pottenstein in the Upper Franconian county of Bayreuth. The castle is home to a museum and both may be visited for a fee.  Location  The spur castle is located within the Franconian Switzerland-Veldenstein Forest Nature Park at a height of roughly 410 metres on a west-facing hill spur between the valleys of the P√ºttlach and the Weihersbach, immediately southeast and above the town of Pottenstein, about 22 kilometres southwest of Bayreuth. In the vicinity are other castles: to the west are G√∂√üweinstein Castle, Kohlstein Castle and the ruins of the Upper and Lower Castles in T√ºchersfeld, to the east are the ruins of Hollenberg Castle and sites of Wartberg and B√∂heimstein castles.  History of the castle  = Foundation = Around 1050, the village of Pottenstein belonged to Margrave Otto of Schweinfurt and, after his death in 1057, went to his third daughter, Judith. Judith's first marriage was to Duke Cuno of Bavaria. Cuno died in 1055 and in 1057 Judith married Boto, the younger brother of Count Palatine Aribo II of the edelfrei family of the Aribonids. In 1070 h referred to himself as comes de Potensteine , i.e. the Count of Pottenstein. The castle that bore his name (Stein i.e. \\"rock\\" of Boto) must therefore have been built between 1057 and 1070 by Boto. It was probably originally established to guard the area between the Upper Main and Pegnitz to the southeast. There is no clear documentary evidence for an alternative theory that the castle was built around 918 by King Conrad I. = Administrative castle of the Bishopric = Pottenstein Castle seen from the northwest. C. 1840 lithograph by Theodor Rothbarth based on a drawing by Carl K√§ppel Pottenstein Castle from the north Pottenstein Castle from the south Pottenstein Castle from the east (nature reserve) Boto died in 1104 with heirs and was buried in Theres Abbey. Judith had died in 1066. From the fact that the castle is not among the acquisitions of Otto I the Holy, who from 1102 to 1139 held the title of bishop, it can be concluded that Boto had sold the castle during his lifetime before or in 1102 to the Bamberg diocese. Around 1118 and in 1121, Bishop Otto I resided at the castle. During the following centuries, Pottenstein Castle was entrusted by the bishops of Bamberg to a ministerialis family who renamed themselves after the castle. The oldest known members of the family was a Wezelo of Pottenstein around 1121; in 1169 there was a Rapoto of Pottenstein. He was followed by Erchenbert or Erchenbrecht of Pottenstein from 1185 to 1221, but from about 1207 he was also a truchsess or steward to the bishop. His brother Henry called himself von Pottenstein. Other members of the family followed, including a Conrad of Pottenstein in 1240-1248, who was a cathedral canon from 1242. From 1227 to 1228 Pottenstein Castle served as a temporary residence for Saint Elizabeth, Landgravine of Thuringia. Between 1323/1327 and 1348 the castle became the seat of an amt or administrative base for the Bishopric of Bamberg. In 1348 a Gebhard Storo was the amtmann in Pottenstein. Pottenstein was the centre of an extensive judicial district. The administrative area of Pottenstein was enlarged by the incorporation of smaller episcopal offices: in 1492 the Amt of T√ºchersfeld, in 1594 Amt Leienfels and in 1628-1636 Amt G√∂√üweinstein. From the beginning of the 14th century, the castle was managed by a vogt or advocate, who had his seat in the Vogteihaus in the lower ward. This Vogteihaus was referred to in 1728 and 1743 as the Old Vogtei, the vogt had meanwhile moved, probably in 1728, to a building in the town, at the latest in 1748 he moved into the Vogthaus, which was purchased in 1745 and rebuilt in 1748/1749. The reason for the move was the arduous climb up to the hill castle. The only known noble vogt was Walter of Streitberg in 1332, the later vogts, who held office in the late 16th century, were members of the bourgeois estate. From 1500, the officers called themselves pflegers. They were based in the so-called cabinet in the upper ward. In 1750 the pfleger of the castle also moved into the Vogthaus in the town. The castle was abandoned as an administrative residence and served as a corn granary. = Warlike events = Pottenstein Castle from the northwest, steel engraving (1840) by Henry Winkles During bitter fighting in 1125 between King Lothair III and the Hohenstaufen anti-king, Conrad III, the town of Pottenstein was destroyed by fire but the castle survived. During the Peasants' War, however, it was occupied and plundered by peasants in 1525 but for fear that plummeting and burning debris could also damage houses in the town below, it was not razed. In addition, without the castle, the peasants would have been without protection against the forces of the count Palatine, the margrave and the city of Nuremberg. The Second Margrave War, in which Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Bayreuth launched numerous raids and looting, resulted in heavy damage and led to the destruction of many villages and castles in the Empire, especially in Franconia. On 18 May 1553, Pottenstein Castle was bombarded and occupied by margravial troops. Even the castle chapel in the upper ward was destroyed and was no longer mentioned after 1553. The cost of the damage, 20,000 guilders, indicates that it was not only the outer ward that was captured. In 1634 during the Thirty Years' War a raid by the Swede, Colonel Cratz, failed to take the castle. A trumpeter who pretended to have been sent by the imperial troops, appeared before the castle. He was escorted over the drawbridge, but when the defenders noticed the enemy waiting outside, they quickly drew the drawbridge up. The captured trumpeter was executed after converting to Catholicism. In 1703/1704, during the Spanish Succession War, a garrison was installed in the castle, and it was occupied by soldiers again in 1708 in 1712. In 1703, an oven was installed in the already dilapidated bergfried for the garrison troops. After this time no further warlike events at the castle are recorded. = Private ownership = Town and castle from the north, based on an 1802 painting by Sebastian F√∂rtsch After the transfer of the diocese in 1803 to the Bavarian state during the secularisation period the castle fell into ruins. In 1878, the castle came into the possession of Nuremberg pharmacist, Dr. Heinrich Kleemann, to whom the preservation of the ruins, which were then threatened by demolition, is owed. He died in 1890 and his widow sold the castle in 1900. In 1918, Pottenstein Castle was purchased by the father castellan Winzelo, Baron of Wintzingerode, who died in 2006 and whose noble family was seated at Bodenstein Castle in Thuringia. His life's work was the construction of the museum and the ongoing renovation of the castle complex. The castle is still owned by the family. The castle is now a privately run museum and residence where prehistoric and early historical objects are displayed along with a collection of weapons, books, autographs and three show rooms grouped as an ensemble. The Elizabeth Room in the former tower house, the western part of the palas, commemorates the stay of Saint Elizabeth in 1227-1228. The accessible areas are the upper floor of the main building (great hall, Red Salon, Elizabeth Room), the remnants of the former bergfried, the well house (porcelain, glass, ceramics and ethnographic objects) and the tithe barn (with tithe exhibits, an exhibition on the recent history of castle and changing special exhibitions). In addition to the impression of a well-preserved castle of the 16th century with a medieval substance, visitors may also tour the castle gardens with their outstanding views over the town and countryside. = Murder at the castle = On 2 April 1866, Max S√∂hnlein, who had just been released from Bayreuth Gaol, killed the wife of the castle guard with a pick in the presence of her infant. Max S√∂hnlein was the son of a former castle guard and committed the murder to conceal a crime. He wanted to steal clothes and money, when he realized that his parents no longer lived at the castle. He was arrested shortly thereafter in Pegnitz and sentenced on 7 May 1866 to life imprisonment at a trial by jury in Bayreuth. Due to his youth - he was only 20 years old - the usual death penalty could not be imposed.  Literature  * Kai Kellermann: Herrschaftliche G√§rten in der Fr√§nkischen Schweiz ‚Äì Eine Spurensuche.

Early life He was the son of Lt- Col Sir Henry Tate, 4th Bt and Lilian Nairne Gregson-Ellis, and was born on the dining room table of his grandfather the 3rd Baronet's house in Park Lane, London, taking his Christian name from his maternal grandfather, Saxon Gregson-Ellis. Saxon Tate went to Eton College, did national service in the Life Guards, and studied history at Christ Church, Oxford before abandoning his studies to start work at Tate & Lyle. He joined the company in 1952, served his apprenticeship in Liverpool at the company's Love Lane refinery (one of the last of the Tate family to do so), and joined the board in 1956. Tate and Lyle career From the mid-1960s Tate reorganised a Canadian subsidiary, Redpath Industries, before returning to the UK in 1973 enthused about American management methods, but also aware of rising competition from artificial sweeteners. He chaired a triumvirate executive committee when British membership of the European Economic Community threatened Tate & Lyle's core business, with quotas imposed from Brussels favouring domestic sugar beet producers over imported cane refiners such as Tate & Lyle. As a result, the company began to diversify into related fields of commodity trading, transport and engineering, and in 1976, it acquired competing cane sugar refiner Manbr√© & Garton. By this stage, Saxon Tate was managing director of Tate & Lyle, but his attempts to diversify the business and introduce modern management methods were only partly successful and he was eventually succeeded in 1980 by one of his own recruits, Canadian Neil Shaw. Tate served as vice-chairman until 1982 and as a director until April 1999. Later career Tate served for three years as chief executive of the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, successor to the Northern Ireland Development Agency. He then chaired the London Commodity Exchange. This had traditionally traded in sugar, coffee and cocoa but, at Tate's instigation, expanded and rebranded to become the London Futures and Options Exchange. In the 1991 New Year Honours, Tate was appointed a CBE.United Kingdom list:, see p.9. However, the introduction of real-estate futures contracts in 1991 led to a scandal when it was discovered that trading volumes had been artificially boosted, and in October Tate resigned alongside the executive responsible, Mark Blundell. Today, the Exchange is known as the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Tate also chaired the Economic League in the late 1970s, and after its demise in 1993 became a non-executive director of one of its successors, CAPRiM. Family life Saxon Tate succeeded to the baronetcy in 1994. He married twice. His first marriage, in 1953, to Sheila Robertson, produced four sons, but was dissolved in 1975. That same year, Tate married Virginia Sturm. He lived for some years in Sychdyn in Flintshire, north Wales, and had a London residence in Cleaver Square in Kennington, before spending his retirement years mainly in the Algarve, Portugal, where he died on 11 July 2012. His eldest son, Edward, born in 1966, inherited the title.

The regions were organized between 1941 and 1944 and were commanded by an officer known as the F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote for his particular region. Regions could contain as few as two flotillas with as many as ten. History Before the outbreak of World War II, individual U-boat flotillas were under the direct command of a single F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote (F.d.U.) in the person of Karl D√∂nitz. who had also acted as commander of the 1st U-boat Flotilla. In 1939, D√∂nitz's title was renamed as the Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote (B.d.U.) to which all the flotillas directly reported. The first U-boat region was created in Italy in November 1941 to provide local command authority for the U-boat flotillas operating in the Mediterranean Sea. The largest region, \\"Region West\\" headquartered in Paris, was established in 1942 to oversee U-boat activity during the Battle of the Atlantic.Gr√∂ner, Erich, Die Schiffe der deutschen Kriegsmarine und ihr Verbleib 1939-1945, J.F. Lehmanns Verlag, M√ºnchen (1976) Later war U-boat regions were created between 1943 and 1944 due to the various operational needs of the U-boat flotillas. The standard rank for a U-boat region commander was either Fregattenkapit√§n or Kapit√§n zur See. Towards the end of the war, a new office known as Kommandierender Admiral der Unterseeboote, was established by the Kriegsmarine to direct overall submarine operations. An office known as the Operationsabteilung (b.d.U.op) coordinated specific u-boat tactics. In the last weeks of the war, when U-boat operations were mostly restricted to the North Sea around Norway, the Oberkommando der Marine (OKM) became the direct commander for the U-boat regions. Some flotillas overlapped between regions due to shifting base assignments and operational tasking. Atlantic U-boat regions U-boat Region West - F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote West (F.d.U.West) The F.d.U. West region was the largest U-boat command established during the Second World War.Hildebrand H., R√∂hr A., & Steinmetz H., Die Deutschen Kriegsschiffe, Koehlers Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Hamburg (1980) The region began in July 1942 as a legal affairs office known as the Gericht des F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote West. In 1943, the U-boat region was expanded under the command of Kapit√§n zur See Hans-Rudolf R√∂sing and moved its command to Angers. At its height, the U-boat Region West held authority over ten U-boat flotilla. Day-to-day operations were overseen by two staff offices (1. und 2. Admiralstabsoffizier). The command also maintained an engineering office, administrative office, medical department, as well as the original legal office. Specific assigned flotillas were: * 1st U-boat Flotilla * 2nd U-boat Flotilla * 3rd U-boat Flotilla * 6th U-boat Flotilla * 7th U-boat Flotilla * 9th U-boat Flotilla * 10th U-boat Flotilla * 11th U-boat Flotilla * 12th U-boat Flotilla * 13th U-boat Flotilla In August 1944, as the Germans withdrew from France, the staff of region west evacuated to Norway. The command technically existed until the end of the war, although its authority now overlapped with the North Sea U-boat regions. U-boat Region Central - F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote Mitte (F.d.U.Mitte) This U-boat region was formed in May 1944 solely for combating the anticipated Allied invasion of France. No flotillas were ever assigned and the region disbanded after the Invasion of Normandy. Mediterranean U-boat regions U-boat Region Italy - F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote Italien (F.d.U.Italien) Existed from 1941 to 1943 before being renamed as the U-boat Region Mediterranean. * 23rd U-boat Flotilla * 29th U-boat Flotilla U-boat Region Mediterranean - F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote Mittelmeer (F.d.U.Mittelmeer) Received the 23rd and 29th flotillas from the Italian region due to restructuring in 1943. Eventually dwindled to only three U-boats assigned to the entire region. By the end of the war, the region was a paper command placed under the authority of the \\"Admiral √Ñg√§is Division\\", part of Marinegruppenkommando S√ºd. North Sea U-boat regions U-boat Region East - F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote Ost (B.d.U.Ost) * 4th U-boat Flotilla * 8th U-boat Flotilla * 31st U-boat Flotilla * 32nd U-boat Flotilla U-boat Region Norway - F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote Norwegen (F.d.U.Norwegen) The last U-boat region to be in operation as of May 1945 when Germany surrendered. * 11th U-boat Flotilla * 13th U-boat Flotilla * 14th U-boat Flotilla * 29th U-boat Flotilla U-boat Region North Sea - F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote Nordmeer (F.d.U.Nordmeer) Made up of retreating U-boat flotillas during the German withdrawal from Occupied France.

Flotilla 28 was ordered in 1944 and likewise never formed. The 30th U-boat Flotilla operated independently in the Black Sea and was never assigned to a U-boat region.

Photography was one of her main interests during the 1890s. Dryden drove herself around in a dogcart photographing old buildings, villages and other scenes in Northamptonshire and beyond. Some of these were later published in her books in the county history Memorials series published by Bemrose. She and Margaret Jourdain worked together on a book about areas that would be affected by the construction of the Great Central Railway. Their friendship led to an important collaboration on the history of lace. Dryden and Jourdain added chapters and photographs to Fanny Bury Palliser‚Äôs 1865 book, History of Lace. The updated and expanded version was well reviewed in the Times Literary Supplement which commented on the \\"good use\\" made of \\"modern photographic methods\\".Thomas Humphry Ward , 'Mrs Palliser's History of Lace', Times Literary Supplement, 25 June 1902 This new History of Lace, \\"entirely revised, re-written, and enlarged under the editorship of M.

It was fought between the Roman client-king Tiberius Julius Cotys I and his allies King Eunones of Aorsi and the Roman commander Gaius Julius Aquila against the former king Tiberius Julius Mithridates and his ally King Zorsines of Siraces.  Sources and dating  Coin of Tiberius Julius Mithridates Sources that mention the conflict include Tacitus's Annals (Book 12, chapter 7), Cassius Dio's Roman History (Book 59, chapter 12), and Peter the Patrician's History. Coins found from the period are important in helping to date the events. The commonly provided dates for the war are 45 to 49, because the oldest coin found featuring the monogram of Cotys has the date 342 Bosporan era (AB), which corresponds to 45 Common Era (CE), and Tacitus relates that Mithridates arrived in Rome in 49 CE after having been driven from the Bosporus. Prelude Tetranummia coined by Tiberius Julius Cotys I Mithridates III and Cotys I were sons of Aspurgus and Gepaepyris who were rulers of the Bosporan Kingdom. After the death of his father in 38, Mithridates III became joint- ruler with his mother Gepaepyris, and sometime between 38 and 45, Roman Emperor Claudius made him ruler of all of the Bosporan Kingdom. In 45, for reasons unknown, Claudius deposed Mithridates and made his younger brother, Cotys I, ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom. At the same time, Claudius withdrew the Roman garrison under Aulus Didius Gallus leaving only a few cohorts under Gaius Julius Aquila. In response, Mithridates III allied himself with the neighbouring tribes, most notably with the Siraces under Zorsines and he was able to raise an army and push out the king of the Dandaridae and establish himself in that king's dominions. He then declared war against his brother and the Roman cohorts under Aquila. When Cotys heard of this, he turned to Gaius Julius Aquila and his Roman cohorts to help him fight off his elder brother. Cotys and Aquila feared that Mithridates's army was larger, and enlisted the help of Eunones, who was at the time ruler of the Aorsi. Eunones quickly sided with the Pro-Roman faction, as Aquila pointed out the strength of Rome to that of Mithridates. Conflict and defeat The Romans began to lay siege to towns under the dominion of Mithridates such as Artezian, a fortress in Crimea while the Aorsi under Eunones laid siege to the fortified settlement of Uspe under Zorsines. After crossing the river Panda, Eunones lay siege to Uspe, which was a weakly-protected fortified city of the Siraces. The settlement had weak defences and was not able to withstand an attack. The Aorsi constructed towers to \\"annoy\\" the people of Uspe with darts and arrows. Throughout the siege, the town offered them 10,000 slaves, an offer which the Romans travelling with the Aorsi declined, as they were too rebellious to keep in check. Within a day Zorsines made peace with his enemies to end the siege of Uspe. Meanwhile, Aquila and his cohorts were attacking the towns of Mithridates. Upon hearing that Zorsines had made peace with his enemies, Mithridates realised that he was losing and considered to whom he should seek mercy. He turned to Eunones, the only one of his enemies that was not in the conflict for personal benefit. Mithridates went to Eunones's palace and threw himself at the ruler's feet and said \\"Mithridates, whom the Romans have sought so many years by land and sea, stands before you by his own choice. Deal as you please with the descendant of the great Achaemenes, the only glory of which enemies have not robbed me.\\" This act of greatly affected Eunones, and he raised the former ruler and was pleased that Mithridates had chosen the Aorsi to help him sue for mercy with Rome. Aftermath After sending envoys to Claudius, Mithridates pleaded mercy in front of the Roman Emperor himself. Claudius deemed Mithridates's actions deserving of extreme penalties. However, Mithridates said that \\"I have not been sent, but have come back to you; if you do not believe me, let me go and pursue me\\" Claudius was impressed by the good-will of Mithridates, and let him live.

Biography Sven Berge began his career during the summer of 1936 with an internship at Johansson & C:o Mekaniska Verkstad in Ljusdal, doing engine repairs and other mechanical-related tasks. From the autumn 1936 to the summer of 1937, he was an intern at Nydqvist & Holm AB in Trollh√§ttan, assembling engines. The summer of 1939 he did his last internship at the sales department of AB Atlas-Diesel in Stockholm, responsible for delivery control and statistics. The same year, he began his compulsory military service. Berge graduated in mechanical engineering from Maskintekniska linjen at √ñrebro gymnasium in 1940. On his birthday 1943, Berge was commissioned as f√§nrik of the Reserve after completing \\"reservofficersaspirantskola f√∂r infanteriets pansarf√∂rband\\" (Reserve officer aspirant-school for the infantry's armoured units) at I 9 in 1941 and \\"pansartruppernas reservofficersskola\\" ( Swedish Armoured Troops reserve officershool at I 10 in 1942. State of readiness- service lasted nine months and was carried out at I 9 as squad- and 2nd platoon leader somewhere between summer of 1941 and the end of 1944. On 1 December 1942, Berge was employed by Kontrollbyr√•n at Tygavdelningen p√• Kungliga Arm√©f√∂rvaltningen (KAF T) (Inspection bureau in the Material&Supply; department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration) in a so called unified service, which meant he parallel was a civil servant at KAF and officer in the armed forces. This allowed him to continue as instructor and teacher for various armoured units when the work as inspector of tank production left some time to spare. In the task as inspector was included to solve various technical problems related to armoured vehicles, something he did by his own initiative: early 1943 he wrote about using overpressure as protection against chemical weapons, the year after a suggestion regarding improved wading capabilities for stridsvagn m/40 was written. By 1945, Berge had advanced from assistant inspector to executive for grupp Pansarfordon (group Armoured vehicles) at the delivery section in Stockholm. In the beginning of the 1950s, Berge was involved both in the evaluation of AMX-13 preceding a planned purchase of some 300-400 tanks (aborted in 1953 when the English changed their position and offered direct delivery of the Centurion), and the meticulous pre-studies for a new domestic tank. Especially the effects in actual combat was scrutinised: where did the hits strike, what damage did they cause, and how did it effect vehicles and crews. Although the Centurion was an excellent tank, a lighter, more numerous tank was also needed to support the infantry with direct fire.http://tanks.mod16.org/2014/02/09/light- tank-development-program-1949-1950/nggallery/image/1950-20-ton-tank- project-16/ Since the purchase from France was cancelled, another solution was required. Sven Berge suggested that the anti-air guns (7,5 cm luftv√§rnskanon m/36 and m/37)) that no longer were adequate for their role was to be used to modernise the outdated stridsvagn m/42. In 1954, he was appointed project manager for the modernisation, given two m/42 to validate his suggestions. The problem with the long barrels causing the guns to be heavy on the nose was solved in a typical manner: gigantic Swiss clock-springs formed the basis of a balancing mechanism. Thus some 225 stridsvagn 74 was ordered, and delivered between 1957 and 1960. Sven Berge had by then already moved on to the construction that would make him famous and result in stridsvagn 103. In August 1956, his section manager H√∂glund and the Chief of Fordonsbyr√•n (the Vehicle bureau of KAFT) Eric Gillner was presented the basic concept. 22 October 1956, \\"Notification of a Swedish invention\\" was filed, where the technical solution for gun laying using the tank's tracks was detailed.http://ointres.se/anmalan_om_svensk_uppfinning.htm During the 1970s, Sven Berge was the chairman in a study group within the project Underlag Direkt Eld (UDES) (Base data Direct Fire), that studied concepts and innovations concerning tanks and other combat vehicles. Besides Swedish and English, Berge was also fluent in French, German and Russian, which certainly facilitated his constant reading and translation of specialist literature concerning combat vehicles and related technology. After his retirement as senior chief engineer and head of the Study- and development section at Stridsfordonsbyr√•n (Combat vehicle bureau), F√∂rsvarets Materielverk, in 1984, Sven Berge opened his own consultant firm in Malm√∂, named \\"Swedish Armour\\". He also participated in the \\"Technical Advisory Group‚Äù, at General Dynamics Land Systems i Detroit together with his personal friends Philip W Lett and general Israel Tal.

It is dedicated to Saint Charalambos. According to a legend, repeated by Mihail Sadoveanu in Hanu Ancu»õei, there were two brothers from Epirus, Gheorghe and Haralambie Leondarie, who served as head messengers (ceau»ôi) for Prince Constantine Ypsilantis at the end of the 18th century. After Haralambie became a hajduk, Ypsilantis ordered Gheorghe to capture the outlaw dead or alive, on pain of execution. The latter went on pursuit with fifty troops. While attempting to capture his brother near VƒÉratec Monastery, Gheorghe accidentally killed him. He gave Haralambie's head to the prince, quit the service and, in order to obtain forgiveness, built the church on a plot of land granted by Ypsilantis. Begun in 1799, it was consecrated in 1804. The structure had three spires; the interior painting was done around 1900. The bell tower preserves one bell donated by the ktitor in 1804 and others from the parishioners. In the early 19th century, the church belonged to the guild of mercenaries in the prince's guard and to firearms makers. For a time, the church served Old Believers driven out of Russia. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site There was a graveyard outside the church; part of the remains were disinterred after Eternitatea cemetery was established in 1871, an exception being Gheorghe Leondari, who was buried there after his death in 1835. A hundred years later, his remains were placed in the church, on the right side of the nave. Also in 1935, the church was blessed a second time by Metropolitan Nicodim Munteanu. An athenaeum associated with the church was built in the yard in 1934. This hosted cultural figures, among the most popular speakers being philosopher Ion Petrovici. It was destroyed during World War II. After the 1977 Vrancea earthquake, the damaged spires were rebuilt in 1997-1998 and the interior repainted in 1987-1989. During the same period, the MiclƒÉu»ôeni Monastery donated part of Saint Charalambos' relics to the parish. Following the Romanian Revolution, a bakery and food pantry were established at the church. Short history at the Saint Charalambos parish site The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

At first, all three claimants to the throne, Satyros, Prytanis, and Eumelos sought Aripharnes to back them to the throne.

Biography  Thackeray was born in Windsor, Berkshire, a younger son of physician Dr Frederick Thackeray, and a grandson of Thomas Thackeray, headmaster of Harrow School. His first cousin once removed was the writer William Makepeace Thackeray.\\"THACKERAY, WILLIAM MAKEPEACE (1811‚Äì1863)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, , accessed 4 May 2019 He entered the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich and became a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in 1793 but transferred to the Royal Engineers the following year. He served from 1793 at Gibraltar, where he was promoted first lieutenant in 1796, and then transferred to the West Indies in 1797. He took part, on 20 August 1799, in the capture of Surinam under Sir Thomas Trigge. In 1801 he was aide-de-camp to Trigge at the capture of the Swedish West India island of St. Bartholomew, the Dutch island of St. Martin and the Danish islands of St. Thomas and St. John. In 1807, now a captain, he was sent to Sicily, from where he proceeded to Egypt with the expedition under Major-general McKenzie Fraser, returning to Sicily in September. In 1809 Thackeray was commanding Royal Engineer with a force under Lieutenant-Colonel Haviland Smith, and was detached by Sir John Stuart to make an attack on the castle of Scylla, which Thackeray directed with such skill that, although his siege was raised by a superior force of French, the castle had by then become untenable and had to be blown up. In 1810 Thackeray was sent from Messina to join Colonel (afterwards General Sir) John Oswald in the Ionian Islands with orders to take part in the siege of the fortress of Santa Maura on the island of Lefkada. The position of the fortress on a long narrow isthmus of sand rendered it difficult to approach, and it was not only well supplied, but contained casemated barracks for a garrison of eight hundred men under General Camus. General Oswald effected a landing on 23 March and the enemy were driven out of their forward entrenchments at bayonet point by the 35th Regiment of Foot. Large working parties were at once sent in and the entrenchment converted into a secure lodgment from which the British infantry and sharpshooters were so able to distress the artillery of the fort that it surrendered. Thackeray was mentioned in general orders and in despatches and received on 19 May 1810 a brevet majority in special recognition of his services on this occasion. Major Thackeray sailed in July 1812 with the Anglo- Sicilian army under Lieutenant-General Frederick Maitland and landed at Alicante in August. He took part in the operations of this army, which, after Maitland's resignation in October, was successively commanded by Generals Mackenzie, William Clinton, Campbell, and Sir John Murray, who arrived in February 1813. In 1813 Thackeray marched with them from Alicante to attack General Suchet, and was at the capture of Alcoy. He also took part in the Battle of Castalla when Suchet was defeated. In May 1813 he embarked with the army, fourteen thousand strong, with a powerful siege train and ample engineer stores, for Tarragona, where they disembarked in June. Thackeray directed the siege operations, and by 8 June a practicable breach was made in Fort Royal, an outwork over four hundred yards in advance of the place. Thackeray was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers in July 1813. He had moved, at the end of June, with Lord William Bentinck's army to Alicante, and was at the occupation of Valencia on 9 July, and at the Siege of Tarragona on 30 July. He took part in the other operations of the army under Bentinck and his successor, Sir William Clinton. During October and November Thackeray was employed in rendering Tarragona once more defensible. In April 1814, by Wellington's orders, Clinton's army was broken up, and Thackeray returned to England in ill-health. At the beginning of 1815 he was appointed commanding Royal Engineer at Plymouth, transferred to Gravesend in 1817, and thence to Edinburgh in 1824 as commanding Royal Engineer of North Britain. He was promoted to be colonel in the Royal Engineers on 2 June 1825 and made a CB on 26 September 1831. In 1833 he was appointed commanding Royal Engineer in Ireland and promoted to be Major-general on 10 January 1837 when he retired. He was made a Colonel-commandant of the corps of Royal Engineers on 29 April 1846, was promoted Lieutenant-General later that year, and made full General on 20 June 1854. He died at his home in Windlesham, Bagshot, Surrey, on 19 September 1860, and was buried at York Town, Farnborough. He had married Lady Elizabeth Margaret Carnegie, third daughter of William, 7th Earl of Northesk. Lady Elizabeth, three sons, and five daughters survived him.

It was founded in 2010 by Niv Carmi, Omri Lavie, and Shalev Hulio. It employed almost 500 people as of 2017, and is based in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv. Annual revenues were around US$40 million in 2013 and $150 million in 2015. In June 2017, the company was put up for sale for $1 billion by Francisco Partners Management. Founders Lavie and Hulio, partnering with European private equity fund Novalpina Capital, purchased a majority stake in NSO in February 2019. NSO claims that it provides \\"authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime\\". According to several reports, software created by NSO Group was used in targeted attacks against human rights activists and journalists in various countries, was used in state espionage against Pakistan, and played a role in the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Kashoggi. In October 2019, instant messaging company WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook sued NSO under the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). The Pegasus spyware is classified as a weapon by Israel and any export of the technology must be approved by the government. History NSO's founders are ex-members of Unit 8200, the Israeli Intelligence Corps unit responsible for collecting signals intelligence. The company's start-up funding came from a group of investors headed by Eddy Shalev, a partner in venture capital fund Genesis Partners. The group invested a total of $1.8 million for a 30% stake. In 2012, the government of Mexico announced the signing of a $20 million contract with NSO. In 2015, the company sold surveillance technology to the government of Panama. The contract became the subject of a Panamanian anti- corruption investigation following its disclosure in a leak of confidential information from Italian firm Hacking Team. In 2014, the American private equity firm Francisco Partners bought the company for $130 million. In 2015 Francisco was seeking to sell the company for up to $1 billion. The company was officially put up for sale for more than $1 billion in June 2017, roughly ten times what Francisco originally paid in 2014. At that time, NSO had almost 500 employees, up from around 50 in 2014. On August 1, 2018, the Human Rights Group Amnesty International accused NSO Group of helping Saudi Arabia spy on a member of the organization‚Äôs staff. Citizen Lab researchers reported in October 2018 that they were being targeted by undercover operatives connected to NSO. An AP report on the incident could not find direct evidence connecting the operative surveillance of Citizen Lab's researchers to NSO, and NSO has denied any involvement. Updated January 26 According to Raphael Satter's January 25 article, Citizen Lab \\"has drawn attention for its repeated expos√©s of NSO Group\\", whose \\"wares have been used by governments to target journalists in Mexico, opposition figures in Panama and human rights activists in the Middle East\\". In early February 2019, one of the operatives targeting Citizen Lab researchers was identified as Aharon Almog-Assouline, a \\"former Israeli security official living in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon.\\" On February 14, 2019, Francisco Partners sold a 60% majority stake of NSO back to co-founders Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie, who were supported in the purchase by Novalpina Capital. Hulio and Lavie invested $100 million, with Novalpina acquiring the remaining portion of the majority stake, thus valuing the company at approximately $1 billion. The day after the acquisition, Novalpina attempted to address the concerns raised by Citizen Lab with a letter, stating their belief that NSO operates with sufficient integrity and caution. In April 2019, NSO froze its deals with Saudi Arabia over a scandal alleging NSO software's role in tracking murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the months before his death. In May 2019, messaging service WhatsApp alleged that a spyware injection exploit targeting its calling feature was developed by NSO. Victims were exposed to the spyware payload even if they did not answer the call. WhatsApp told the Financial Times that \\"the attack has all the hallmarks of a private company known to work with governments to deliver spyware that reportedly takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems.\\" NSO denied involvement in selecting or targeting victims, but did not explicitly deny creating the exploit. In response to the alleged cyberattack, WhatsApp sued NSO under the CFAA and other US laws in a San Francisco court on October 29. WhatsApp stated that the exploit targeted 1,400 users in 20 countries, including \\"at least 100 human-rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society\\". NSO employees had complained to WhatsApp about improved security, according to the court filings by WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook: \\"On or about May 13, 2019, Facebook publicly announced that it had investigated and identified a vulnerability involving the WhatsApp Service (). WhatsApp and Facebook closed the vulnerability, contacted law enforcement, and advised users to update the WhatsApp app. Defendants subsequently complained that WhatsApp had closed the vulnerability. Specifically, NSO Employee 1 stated, 'You just closed our biggest remote for cellular . . . It‚Äôs on the news all over the world.'\\" WhatsApp also alerted the 1,400 targeted users. At least in one case, the surveillance was authorized by a judge. In April 2020, NSO group blamed hacking of 1400 WhatsApp users including journalists and human rights activists on its government clients. However, the firm did not disclose the names of its clients which, as Citizen Lab stated, include authorities in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Morocco, and Mexico. In court filings WhatsApp alleged that its investigation into how NSO's Pegasus was used against 1,400 users in 2019 showed that the hacks originated from NSO Group servers rather than its clients'. WhatsApp said \\"NSO used a network of computers to monitor and update Pegasus after it was implanted on users' devices. These NSO-controlled computers served as the nerve centre through which NSO controlled its customers' operation and use of Pegasus.\\" WhatsApp said that NSO gained \\"unauthorised access\\" to WhatsApp servers by reverse- engineering the WhatsApp app to be able to evade security features. NSO responded \\"NSO Group does not operate the Pegasus software for its clients\\". Pegasus spyware Early versions of Pegasus were used to surveil the phone of Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n, known as El Chapo. In 2011, Mexican president Felipe Calder√≥n reportedly called NSO to thank the company for its role in Guzm√°n's capture. The Israeli Ministry of Defense licenses the export of Pegasus to foreign governments, but not to private entities. On August 25, 2016, Citizen Lab and Lookout revealed that Pegasus was being used to target human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor in the United Arab Emirates. Mansoor informed Citizen Lab researchers Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton that his iPhone 6 had been targeted on August 10, 2016, by means of a clickable link in an SMS text message. Analysis by Citizen Lab and Lookout discovered that the link downloaded software to exploit three previously unknown and unpatched zero-day vulnerabilities in iOS. According to their analysis, the software can jailbreak an iPhone when a malicious URL is opened, a form of attack known as spear phishing. The software installs itself and collects all communications and locations of targeted iPhones, including communications sent through iMessage, Gmail, Viber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and Skype. The software can also collect Wi-Fi passwords. The researchers noticed that the software's code referenced an NSO Group product called \\"Pegasus\\" in leaked marketing materials. Pegasus had previously come to light in a leak of records from Hacking Team, which indicated the software had been supplied to the government of Panama in 2015. The researchers discovered that Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera had also been targeted, and that the software could have been used in Israel, Turkey, Thailand, Qatar, Kenya, Uzbekistan, Mozambique, Morocco, Yemen, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Bahrain. Citizen Lab and Lookout notified Apple's security team, which patched the flaws within ten days and released an update for iOS. A patch for macOS was released six days later. In 2017, Citizen Lab researchers revealed that NSO exploit links may have been sent to Mexican scientists and public health campaigners. The targets supported measures to reduce childhood obesity, including Mexico's \\"Soda Tax.\\" In April 2017, after a Lookout report, Google researchers discovered Android malware \\"believed to be created by NSO Group Technologies\\" and naming it Chrysaor (Pegasus' brother in Greek mythology). According to Google, \\"Chrysaor is believed to be related to the Pegasus spyware\\". In July 2017, the international team assembled to investigate the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping publicly complained they thought they were being surveilled by the Mexican government. They stated that the Mexican government used Pegasus to send them messages about funeral homes containing links which, when clicked, allowed the government to surreptitiously listen to the investigators. The Mexican government has repeatedly denied any unauthorized hacking. In June 2018, an Israeli court indicted a former employee of NSO Group for allegedly stealing a copy of Pegasus and attempting to sell it online for $50 million worth of cryptocurrency. In October 2018 Citizen Lab reported on the use of NSO software to spy on the inner circle of Jamal Khashoggi just before his murder. Citizen Lab's October report stated, with high confidence, that NSO's Pegasus had been placed on the iPhone of Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, one of Khashoggi's confidantes, months before. Abdulaziz stated that the software revealed Khashoggi's \\"private criticisms of the Saudi royal family,\\" which according to Abdulaziz \\"played a major role\\" in Khashoggi's death. In December 2018, a New York Times investigation concluded that Pegasus software played a role in the Khashoggi's murder, with a friend of Khashoggi stating in a filing that Saudi authorities had used the Israeli-made software to spy on the dissident. NSO CEO Shalev Hulio stated that the company had not been involved in the \\"terrible murder\\", but declined to comment on reports that he had personally traveled to the Saudi capital Riyadh for a $55 million Pegasus sale. In June 2020, an investigation by Amnesty International alleged that Moroccan journalist Omar Radi was targeted using the Israeli spyware Pegasus. The rights group claimed that the journalist was targeted three times and spied after his device was infected with an NSO tool. Meanwhile, Amnesty also claimed that the attack came after the NSO group updated their policy in September 2019. According to an investigation by The Guardian and El Pa√≠s, Pegasus software was used to compromise the phones of several politicians active in the Catalan independence movement, including President of the Parliament of Catalonia Roger Torrent, and former member of the Parliament of Catalonia Anna Gabriel i Sabat√©.

Early years George Joseph Ball was originally trained as a barrister. MI5 As Major Joseph Ball, he was recruited into MI5 in 1915, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. He served in key operational roles with MI5 until 1927, and was believed to have played a significant role in the creation of the forged Zinoviev Letter in 1924, an episode which quickly led to the defeat of the British Labour Party government headed by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. Conservative Party administrator Ball was a 'fervent political supporter' of the Conservative Party. From his work with MI5, Ball came to the attention of British Conservative Party leadership, and was hired out of MI5 in 1927 to run the Propaganda Department at Conservative Party Central Office. In 1930, he moved to head the Conservative Research Department, staying in that role until 1939, when World War II began. Among the young people associated with him during the 1930s were numbered Guy Burgess and Graham Russell Mitchell. Ball's group infiltrated the British Labour Party. Political operator During the 1930s, and into the early years of World War II, he developed and coordinated many links among Britons who supported Nazi Germany, and arranged back channels to key leadership figures in the Third Reich, as well as with Fascist Italy. He also was involved with illegal and secret funding operations, including those of Honours trafficker Maundy Gregory; money from this operation helped fund Chamberlain's appeasement policy; among wealthy figures apparently involved were Canadian / Bahamian gold mining magnate Sir Harry Oakes. World War II With the outbreak of World War II, he was then hired into the Ministry of Information, being placed in charge of films, but was quickly ousted from that position through film industry pressure. For several years a strong backer and close associate of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who came to power in 1937 following the resignation of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, Ball had worked from the mid-1930s to secretly undermine anti-Nazi Conservatives, including Winston Churchill, as well as figures in the Liberal and Labour Parties who opposed far-right totalitarian regimes in Europe. Ball was placed by Chamberlain as Deputy of the Security Executive, a very powerful position which put him above MI5 and MI6, just as Chamberlain resigned as prime minister in May, 1940, being replaced as prime minister by Churchill. Ball suffered badly from Chamberlain's fall and death later in 1940; he wound up serving in that Security Executive position for two years, until 1942. From the mid-1930s into the early 1940s, Ball played a key role in secret direction and control of the weekly newspaper Truth, a pro-fascist publication. This paper attacked Leslie Hore Belisha, the only Jewish cabinet minister, forcing his resignation in 1940. Later years, legacy Ball later joined the South African and Rhodesian gold mining group Lonrho, which had been founded in 1909. He assumed a leadership role, and brought in Tiny Rowland in 1961, shortly before his own death, to run that company. Some of the firm's executives eventually became part of present-day Rio Tinto Group, now one of the world's largest mining companies. Ball was a skilled and noted fly fisherman, who engaged in debate over optimal fishing techniques. Although Ball made strong efforts to destroy the papers at Conservative Central Office outlining his own role there, as well as his personal papers, some papers have survived, and have been housed at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University since August 2000. Since 1990, historians and writers have steadily increased the amount of published material available on Ball's life and career. The character \\"Joseph Balcombe\\", from the 2009 film Glorious 39, by Stephen Poliakoff, is based closely upon Ball; the role was played by actor Jeremy Northam.

Geography La Perouse is located in the Southern Alps of the South Island, four kilometres to the southwest Aoraki / Mount Cook. Unlike Aoraki / Mount Cook, La Perouse sits on the South Island's Main Divide, on the border between Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park and Westland Tai Poutini National Park. On the northern side, the La Perouse Glacier feeds the Cook River that flows into the Tasman Sea. Eponymy It was originally named Mount Stokes after John Lort Stokes, who was assistant surveyor during the second voyage of HMS Beagle (1831‚Äì1836) and captain of the survey ship HMS Acheron (1848‚Äì1851). Because of the prior naming of Mount Stokes in Nelson, the mountain was renamed La Perouse in honour of the French explorer Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de Lap√©rouse (also spelt comte de La P√©rouse) whose expedition foundered on Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz Islands of the Solomon Islands in 1788. 1948 rescue La Perouse was the scene of the most arduous rescue in New Zealand's climbing history in 1948, where Ruth Adams was injured and had to be carried on a stretcher over the summit and through deep gorges to the West Coast road. She was a member in a climbing party including Harry Ayres, Edmund Hillary and Mick Sullivan. The rescue was the first time that Hillary and fellow climber Norman Hardie met; they started a lifelong friendship, with Hardie having been on the board of Edmund Hillary's Himalayan Trust for 22 years.

The club was founded in October 1889, as the local sportsmen's latest attempt to form a permanent football or rugby club in the town. By 1896, Brentford had joined the London League, progressing to the Southern League in 1898 and entering the Football League in 1920. Brentford's rise from the Third Division South to the First Division had come full circle by 1954, with the club back in the bottom-tier for the first time since 1933. After consistently challenging for promotion to the Second Division in the mid-late 1950s, a further decline set in, which led to relegation to the new Fourth Division in 1962 and the club almost went out of existence in 1967. Brentford yo-yoed between the Third and Fourth Divisions through much of the 1960s and 1970s, before finally re-establishing itself in the Third Division after promotion in 1978.  Treading water and promotion challenges  = Back in the Third Division South (1954‚Äì1957) = Relegation to the Third Division South at the end of the 1953‚Äì54 season meant that 1954‚Äì55 would be Brentford's first in the bottom-tier for 21 years. The ¬£10,000 sale of Jimmy Bloomfield was used to pay off debts and though manager Bill Dodgin Sr. had no budget with which to work, the youth team's increasing productivity under Alf Bew presented the club with a conveyor belt of homegrown talent. During the season, the graduation of forwards Jim Towers, George Francis, Dennis Heath and goalkeeper Gerry Cakebread, allied with the experience of former youths Wally Bragg and George Bristow, would become crucial to future promotion- pushes. After a mid-table finish in 1954‚Äì55, Jim Towers' 22 goals in the 1955‚Äì56 season fired Brentford to 6th-place and George Francis established himself as Towers' strike partner in 1956‚Äì57, scoring 24 goals to secure another top-half finish. It was announced in March 1957 that manager Dodgin would leave the club at the end of the 1956‚Äì57 season. = \\"The Terrible Twins\\" (1957‚Äì1961) = Prior to the beginning of the 1957‚Äì58 Third Division South season, former Brentford full back Malky MacDonald was appointed as manager. \\"The Terrible Twins\\" strike partnership of Jim Towers and George Francis was in imperious form during the first four seasons of MacDonald's reign, accounting for nearly 200 goals. Towers' 37 during 1958‚Äì59 made him the Third Division's top-scorer (a total just two goals away from Jack Holliday's club record), plus the 'Twins' accounted for 51 of the Bees' 78 league goals scored during the season. Manager MacDonald was able to field a settled side in the late 1950s and early 1960s, at differing times being able to draw on goalkeeper Gerry Cakebread, full backs Ken Horne, Tom Wilson, half backs George Bristow, Ian Dargie, Ken Coote, Billy Goundry and supporting forwards Johnny Rainford, Dennis Heath, Len Newcombe, George McLeod and Eric Parsons. After three consecutive top-six finishes, the rot set in during the 1960‚Äì61 season, with the poor form on the field mirrored by the news from the boardroom of debts of ¬£50,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). In a bizarre move, Brentford's first-choice kit had also been changed to amber shirts with a blue 'V' around the neck, which was ultimately a single-season experiment. Strike partners Towers and Francis requested to be placed on the transfer list in February 1961 and John Docherty, who had only played 19 matches for the club, departed for a ¬£17,000 fee in March. Brentford finished the 1960‚Äì61 season in 17th-place and stalwarts Bristow, Goundry, Heath, Horne and Parsons were released.  Cost-cutting and bounceback  = Relegation to the Fourth Division (1961‚Äì1963) = In an effort to lessen Brentford's debts, Jim Towers and George Francis were sold to rivals Queens Park Rangers for ¬£8,000 and the club slimmed the playing staff down to 16, with 6 players playing on a part- time status. The board's decision proved to be a disaster and despite the signings of former England international Johnny Brooks, outside right Micky Block and the return of George Francis, the Bees finished second-from-bottom of the 1961‚Äì62 Third Division and were relegated. Manager Malky MacDonald was given a sizeable war chest by chairman Jack Dunnett for Brentford's first season in the Fourth Division, bringing in wing half Matt Crowe (¬£5,000) and inside forward Billy McAdams (¬£10,000). Three defeats in the first five matches of the season saw the chequebook open again, with ¬£17,000 John Dick arriving at Griffin Park to make up a trio of former internationals in the forward line with Billy McAdams and Johnny Brooks. As the Bees' form picked up, ¬£12,000 centre half Mel Scott and ¬£7,000 outside right John Fielding were also added to the ranks. The club climbed into the promotion places in late October 1962, moved into top two in February 1963 and sat at the summit for the first time since the opening day of the season on 29 March 1963. Despite winning just seven of the final 14 matches of the season, Brentford finished 1962‚Äì63 as Fourth Division champions. Dick, McAdams and Brooks scored the majority of the team's goals, netting 69 times between them. = Failure to buy promotion from the Third Division (1963‚Äì1967) = It was a case of \\"same old, same old\\" back in the Third Division, the 1963‚Äì64 season only notable for it being Ken Coote's last in a Brentford shirt, the full back retiring after a club record 559 appearances. Brentford's chances of promotion back to the Second Division looked good throughout the first half of the 1964‚Äì65 season, with the Bees holding top spot through October 1964, but in January 1965, manager Malky MacDonald dropped the bombshell that he would stand down as manager at the end of the campaign. He was immediately placed on gardening leave and trainer Tommy Cavanagh took over the manager's position. Poor away form would ultimately account for Brentford's 5th-place finish. With it felt around Griffin Park that Brentford's squad could again challenge for promotion from the Third Division, little transfer activity occurred during the 1965‚Äì66 pre-season. By November, the Bees were flirting with the relegation places. Jimmy Bloomfield was sold for ¬£6,500, John Docherty returned to the club and Bobby Ross and John Regan were signed in a ¬£10,000 double-deal from Shrewsbury Town. By the final six weeks of the season, mired in relegation, manager Tommy Cavanagh was sacked and replaced by Billy Gray. He failed to produce the miracle required and Brentford were again relegated to the Fourth Division.  Financial crises  = 19 January 1967 = By January 1967, Brentford had spent ¬£114,000 on transfer fees over the previous five seasons (with only ¬£30,000 recouped from fees received), attendances had dropped by 50% since the beginning of the 1965‚Äì66 season and the club was losing ¬£400 a week. It was revealed by chairman Dunnett at Brentford's AGM in December 1966 that the club had lost ¬£20,000 during the previous financial year and that he would be selling his stake in the club. Earlier that month, there had been an approach from neighbours Queens Park Rangers, suggesting that the two clubs share Griffin Park. On 19 January 1967, the news broke that Dunnett and his Queens Park Rangers counterpart Jim Gregory had reached an agreement that Brentford's hated rivals would move into Griffin Park, Rangers' ground Loftus Road would be redeveloped as housing and Brentford, as a club, would cease to exist. It immediately became apparent that the remainder of the Brentford board had not been informed of the situation. After a tense month of fan protests (led by Supporters' Club chairman Peter Pond-Jones), negotiations and donations amounting to ¬£8,500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), a six-man syndicate headed by former Plymouth Argyle chairman Ron Blindell took over Dunnett's shares on 23 February 1967 and guaranteed a 12-month bridging loan of ¬£104,000. The following day, Blindell, as chairman, took control of the club. Manager Billy Gray followed Dunnett out of Griffin Park and trainer Jimmy Sirrel took over as manager. Brentford's form picked up in the wake of the takeover, finishing the 1966‚Äì67 season in 9th position, just two points away from the final promotion place. The Bees also won the London Challenge Cup for the second time in three seasons. = \\"Brentford Borough\\" (1967‚Äì1968) = The Brentford staff began the 1967‚Äì68 season knowing that they were not out of the woods yet, due to the club's ¬£100,000 debt (equivalent to ¬£ in ) needing to be paid by 30 June 1968. Beginning his first full season as manager, Jimmy Sirrel had just 16 players to pick from and had to supplement the squad with loans, performing a remarkable job, hovering around 6th in the table by November 1967. It was reported at the 1967 AGM that the club was almost trading at break even, but by then Brentford had sunk down the table. ¬£12,000 was spent on forwards Ron Fenton and Allan Mansley in January 1968, but they failed to help arrest the slump. On 11 March 1968, chairman Ron Blindell announced that plans were afoot to leave Griffin Park and move to Hillingdon's Leas Stadium. It transpired that Queen Park Rangers chairman Jim Gregory had resurrected his interest in Griffin Park and offered ¬£250,000 for the use of the ground, a fee that would wipe out Brentford's ¬£135,000 debt instantly, if the club moved to Hillingdon. The name \\"Brentford Borough FC\\" had already been chosen for the new Hillingdon-based club, but once again Brentford was saved at the eleventh hour, with former director Walter Wheatley granting the club a ¬£69,000 interest-free loan, repayable in 12 months. Despite atrocious form in the second half of the 1967‚Äì68 season, Brentford had dropped only as far as 14th place.  Back from the abyss  = Recovery and promotion (1969‚Äì1972) = With Pat Terry replacing the departed Ian Lawther up front, Brentford topped the table on the opening day of the 1968‚Äì69 season, before falling back into mid-table. After two seasons of being forced to carry small squads, manager Jimmy Sirrel was able to expand with a number of players signed on free transfers, but the ¬£10,000 sale of John Richardson to help balance the books left Sirrel with just 13 fit players at his disposal by mid-October 1969. Despite having worked wonders to keep Brentford in the Fourth Division promotion hunt, Sirrel departed Brentford for Notts County in November 1969. Player Ron Fenton took caretaker charge, before Frank Blunstone was installed as manager in mid-December. New Zealand international Brian Turner and forward Roger Cross proved to be two of Blunstone's important early signings, but in the end, Brentford missed out on promotion by three points, having lost three of the final seven matches. Despite the 1970‚Äì71 season being chiefly remembered for a run to the fifth round of the FA Cup, it allowed for the establishment of a settled Brentford XI, with Ross, Nelmes, Cross, Gelson, Turner, Renwick and new signing Jackie Graham all making over 40 appearances. The FA Cup run boosted the club's profit on the season to ¬£20,000, which helped pay the final instalment of Ron Blindell's ¬£104,000 loan to the club from February 1967. Aided by the goalscoring of John O'Mara, Brentford raced out of the traps early in the 1971‚Äì72 season and sat atop the Fourth Division table for much of the period between August 1971 and January 1972. The early- season form was achieved with just 12 players, despite forward Roger Cross having been sold to neighbours Fulham for ¬£30,000. Some of the money was reinvested in outside right Michael Allen, but manager Blunstone elected to prop up his squad with loans. Aside from a blip while top-scorer O'Mara was suspended, Brentford secured promotion back to the Third Division with two matches of the season remaining. = Relegation, consolidation and promotion (1972‚Äì1977) = Despite Brentford now showing a ¬£20,000 profit in 1971, compared to a ¬£13,000 loss in 1967, manager Fred Blunstone was again forced to operate on a shoestring budget for the 1972‚Äì73 season, Brentford's first in the Third Division since 1965‚Äì66. After five matches, Brentford were sitting proud in 2nd position, but in mid-September 1972, the previous season's top- scorer John O'Mara was sold to fellow Third Division club Blackburn Rovers for a club record ¬£50,000 fee. Shortly afterwards, influential captain and the previous season's second-leading scorer Bobby Ross also departed. Instead of investing the money in players which could remount the promotion challenge, the board only permitted manager Blunstone to spend ¬£10,000 on forward Stan Webb and ¬£15,000 on the returning Roger Cross. Brentford slipped into the lower reaches of mid-table in December 1972 and then into the relegation zone in March 1973. The Bees were relegated on the final day of the season and Frank Blunstone resigned from the manager's position in July 1973. Under new manager Mike Everitt and his successor John Docherty, Brentford lived in mid- table obscurity in the Fourth Division during the mid-1970s. A poor start to the 1976‚Äì77 season led Docherty to resign and he was replaced by Bill Dodgin Jr. After a period of consolidation, Dodgin's signings Pat Kruse, Paul Shrubb, Barry Lloyd, Len Bond, Willie Graham, Barry Tucker and Doug Allder strengthened a developing team which was spearheaded by forwards Steve Phillips, Andrew McCulloch and Gordon Sweetzer. Though Sweetzer was sold for ¬£30,000 late in the 1977‚Äì78 season, Brentford kept their heads and secured promotion back to the Third Division with a 4th-place finish. Phillips' 32 goals made him the top scorer in the Football League and his total of 36 for the season was just three away from Jack Holliday's club record. = Stability (1978‚Äì1986) = Bill Dodgin Jr, Fred Callaghan and Frank McLintock all managed Brentford in the Third Division between 1978 and 1986, with three successive top-9 finishes between 1981 and 1983 under Callaghan being the club's best placings. Some notable players played for the club during much of the period, including Bob Booker, Jim McNichol, Gary Roberts, Francis Joseph and captains Terry Hurlock and Chris Kamara, but none would see success. Brentford reached its first major competitive cup final in the 1984‚Äì85 season, facing off against Wigan Athletic in the 1985 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium. In front of a 34,932 crowd, Brentford lost 3‚Äì1, with Robbie Cooke scoring what proved to be a consolation goal.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they are stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from the rest of the Federation. In the holonovel, Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), finds a temporary escape from her responsibilities as Voyagers captain by playing a governess in a Gothic novel set in Victorian England. The holonovel was a recurring subplot in the show's first two seasons. It features Michael Cumpsty as Lord Burleigh, and Thomas Dekker and Lindsey Haun as Burleigh's children. Carolyn Seymour guest stars as the housekeeper Mrs. Templeton, and previously played two separate Romulan commanders in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Voyagers writing team developed the holonovel as an expansion of the holodeck, which was introduced earlier in the Star Trek franchise, and a futuristic response to the audiobook. Voyager creator Jeri Taylor initially imagined Janeway Lambda one as a simulation of Western fiction in which Janeway assumed the role of a pioneer woman struggling to contend with the elements and care for her family. The holonovel's genre was changed when Mulgrew refused to work with horses and the crew realized shooting outdoors would exceed the show's budget. The set for the Burleigh manor was constructed on Paramount Stage 16, and was nicknamed \\"the Jane Eyre set\\" by the film crew. Commentators also compared Janeway Lambda one to Henry James' novella The Turn of the Screw and Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca. Parts of the holonovel were included in the teasers for the season one episodes \\"Cathexis\\" and \\"Learning Curve\\", and it was featured in the second-season episode \\"Persistence of Vision\\". In the holonovel's final appearance, Janeway experiences hallucinations of its characters and objects appearing outside of the holodeck due to a bio-electric energy field from a Bothan ship. Janeway Lambda one was intended as a vehicle to further develop Janeway, but critics disagreed on whether the storyline was appropriate for the character. The holonovel was never fully resolved due to lack of interest from Voyager fans. Taylor had written a conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Critics had a negative response to Janeway Lambda one, and questioned how it fit Janeway's role as a female captain. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.  Production  = Concept and development = In the Star Trek franchise, the holodeck is a computer program capable of creating virtual reality simulations chosen by the user.Murray (1997): p. 15 It was first introduced in Star Trek: The Next Generation, but a precursor to the technology appeared in an episode of Star Trek: The Animated Series, entitled \\"The Practical Joker\\", as a technological advanced version of a recreation room.Solow & Justman (1996): p. 404 In The Next Generation, the holodeck was shown as being able to project \\"novellike stories\\", but Star Trek: Voyager expanded on this idea to introduce the \\"fully interactive holonovel\\". Holonovels were distinguished from past examples of holodeck technology through their \\"complex narratives\\" and the user's active participation as one of the characters.Murray (1997): p. 287 Developing the holonovel as a futuristic update of the audiobook, Voyagers writers defined them as computer programs enabling the user to \\"experience total, physical immersion in the story, with a full spectrum of sensations in every way\\".Poe (1998): p. 10 In his book A Vision of the Future, author Stephan Edward Poe wrote the holonovel was intended to provide: \\"new ways for crew members to learn ... to be their own heroes in self-directed sages, or even use their stories as a safe and acceptable means of released pent-up emotions.\\"Poe (1998): p. 11 Voyager creator Jeri Taylor designed Janeway Lambda one as Captain Kathryn Janeway's (Kate Mulgrew)'s favorite holonovel and a \\"story within a story\\" that would slowly unravel with each of its appearances. It was the first holonovel to be featured in the series. Taylor originally imagined the program as a simulation of Western fiction, in which Janeway assumed the role of a pioneer emigrating to the American West on a covered wagon. Janeway's character was described as a wife and mother struggling with daily tasks, and was presented as the polar opposite of Janeway's position as a Starfleet Captain. Taylor described the Western concept as a \\"metaphor for the captain's predicament in the Delta Quadrant\\" and a \\"method of developing and enhancing Janeway's character\\". The plan was subsequently abandoned after Mulgrew disliked working with horses and estimates for developing and filming each scene ranged up to an additional $100,000 per day. Taylor said it was \\"not a prudent decision\\" to keep the Western concept considering the show's budget and the difficulty in shooting outdoor locations. As a result, the concept of Janeway Lambda one was changed to be a work of Gothic fiction set in 1840s England in which Janeway plays Mrs Lucille Davenport.Poe (1998): p. 19Poe (1998): p. 12 Janeway Lambda one features a recurring set of guest stars, who played various members of the Burleigh family and household. Michael Cumpsty was cast as Lord Burleigh, Davenport's love interest. Burleigh's two children, Henry and Beatrice, were played by Thomas Dekker and Lindsey Haun, respectively. Carolyn Seymour portrayed the housekeeper Mrs. Templeton. Seymour had previously guest-starred as the Romulan Subcommander Taris and the Romulan Commander Toreth in The Next Generation episodes \\"Contagion\\" and \\"Face of the Enemy\\".Okuda & Okuda & Mirek (1994) Bridget, a servant who worked for Lord Burleigh, was played by an uncredited actress. While Lord Burleigh's late wife plays a large role in the holonovel, she is only shown in a portrait, and does not appear in any of the episodes. = Direction and filming = Janeway Lambda one was scheduled to debut in the teaser of the first-season episode \\"Eye of the Needle\\", but it was moved to a different episode (\\"Cathexis\\"). Television producer Rick Berman wanted a \\"more exciting shipboard teaser\\" for \\"Eye of the Needle\\". The episode's director Winrich Kolbe collaborated with visual effects producer Dan Curry to create the Gothic novel setting through the use of second unit blue screen sequences. In the episode's pre-production meeting, Kolbe and Taylor met with special effects coordinator Dick Brownfield and unit production manager Brad Yacobian to finalize the set design and to clarify the special effects. Their discussion covered minor actions and effects, such as how much rainwater would be coming through an open window, and whether or not the raindrops on Janeway's clothing would disappear when the simulation ended.Poe (1998): p. 20 Kolbe meticulously planned actors' performances in the teaser sequence, such as researching the proper way of pouring and serving tea according to 1840s customs. According to Poe, attention to such small details in the script was common in the production of Star Trek episodes. According to the script for \\"Eye of the Needle\\", the holodeck program occurred in \\"a drawing room in an English Lord's nineteenth-century manor\\", the script for \\"Cathexis\\" mentions that Janeway's outfit included a crinoline and a corset. The space used for all of the holonovel scenes was dubbed \\"the Jane Eyre set\\" by the film crew. The story was compared to Henry James' novella The Turn of the Screw,Ruditis (2003): p. 25 and Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca. It contained elements of mystery, such as \\"music from a seemingly empty room, a locked fourth-floor door that Davenport/Janeway is forbidden to enter\\". The implication that the holonovel would end with Davenport's marriage to Lord Burleigh shifted the narrative so that it was \\"more romantic than gothic\\".Van Riper (2014): p. 196 Construction of the set began on December 5, 1994, on Paramount Stage 16. The set's construction pushed the episode's cost over its budget. This was considered normal for a new series and the next four episodes also exceeded their budgets.Poe (1998): p. 25 Despite the high cost of the manor set, the crew designed it for repeated use over the course of the series. This was more appealing than shooting several sequences of a covered wagon on location in the countryside. Curry took special care to merge the blue-screen effects with Kolbe's footage seamlessly to achieve the effect of the manor transforming back into the holodeck. Curry and Kolbe had worked together on previous projects that required similar special effects. = Cast response and abandonment = Studio executives and the show's crew were skeptical about Taylor's plans for Janeway Lambda one. Ron Wilkerson, who wrote \\"Learning Curve\\" with Jean Louise Matthias, included the holonovel in the script, but was uncertain of the storyline's direction in future episodes. Despite his confusion, Wilkerson said that he trusted Taylor for her \\"great instincts\\".Gross & Altman (1996): p. 145 \\"Persistence of Vision\\", the episode in which the holonovel was the most heavily featured, was initially met with resistance from Paramount Pictures executives. Taylor attempted to include the episode in the show's first season, but the idea was rejected on the basis of its \\"story and script form.\\" Studio executives felt the episode was a \\"very soft story\\" that lacked action or a clear antagonist, and believed it would not hold an audience's attention.Gross & Altman (1996): p. 159 While discussing Janeway's fight with Templeton, Seymour said the writers were uncertain of how to further develop her character, and viewed the scene as an example of how \\"[t]hey got carried away.\\" Seymour said that Janeway killed Templeton in the original draft of the fight scene, but this was removed as \\"she couldn't do that, because she's never killed anyone.\\" Poe cited Janeway Lambda one as an example of an idea that \\"sounded good in theory, ... [that] didn't work out in practice\\". The storyline was abandoned since everyone disliked it. Taylor reported that fans' lack of interest, and the criticism of Janeway portrayed in the role of a servant or subordinate, resulted in the holonovel being discontinued. Seymour attributed the storyline's removal to the decision to avoid excessive use of the holodeck. Taylor wrote a conclusion for the novel, which was never developed into an episode, and she was disappointed that the narrative was left incomplete. Despite her attachment to the project, she said that she was \\"never afraid to cut our losses if something wasn't working\\". The holonovel was replaced by Janeway seeking counsel from a holographic version of Leonardo da Vinci. In her book Star Trek, media studies scholar Ina Rae Hark argued that this decision was taken to make the series more appealing to a male audience.Hark (2008): p. 122  Appearances in Star Trek: Voyager  Janeway Lambda one is introduced in the teaser sequences of two first-season episodes \\"Cathexis\\" and \\"Learning Curve\\". In \\"Cathexis\\", using her captain's log, Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) notes that she has started a new holonovel set in \\"ancient England\\" (the show's term to indicate Victorian era Britain) as a way \\"to get away from being a captain for a while\\". In the novel, Janeway assumes the role of Lucille Davenport, working for a Lord Burleigh (Michael Cumpsty) as governess of his children Henry (Thomas Dekker) and Beatrice (Lindsey Haun). In the \\"Cathexis\\" teaser, the landlady, Mrs. Templeton (Carolyn Seymour), views Davenport as a threat to the order of the house. Janeway meets Lord Burleigh, and learns about his wife's death and that the children are struggling to accept it. After Burleigh forbids Janeway from entering the manor's fourth floor, Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) interrupts the holonovel to inform the captain that Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran) and Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ) are not responding to their messages while returning from a mission. Janeway leaves the holonovel for the rest of the episode to attend to matters on the ship. In the teaser sequence for \\"Learning Curve\\", Janeway introduces herself to Henry and Beatrice. She plans to teach mathematics and science to Henry, and attempts to discern Beatrice's interests. Beatrice claims that her mother is not dead, and that she saw her the previous night and gave her a sampler. The holonovel is interrupted after a disruption of power to an energy grid, causing Janeway to spend the rest of the episode investigating its cause. Janeway Lambda one plays a larger role in the second-season episode \\"Persistence of Vision\\". Janeway is shown to be stressed and agitated, and the Doctor (Robert Picardo) suggests that she return to the holodeck program to relax. When Janeway resumes her role as Davenport, Lord Burleigh confesses his love for her and kisses her. Janeway confronts him about the mysterious occurrences in the house, her ban from the fourth floor, and Beatrice's assertion that her mother is still alive. Chakotay interrupts Janeway to inform her that a representative of the Bothans has approached the ship. Over the course of the episode, Janeway sees elements of the holonovel appear outside the holodeck, and she begins to question her sanity. She is taunted by multiple appearances of Beatrice and is later attacked by Templeton. At the end of the episode, her visions are explained to be the result of hallucinations caused by a bio-electric energy field from the Bothan ship. Following her experiences with the Bothans, Janeway decides to take a break from fantasy and the holodeck.  Thematic analysis  alt=A woman with shoulder length brown hair and a dark dress stands in front of a clapping man while looking forward. Taylor developed Janeway Lambda one as a space for Janeway to experience a life separate from the responsibilities of being a captain. She said Janeway focused more on using the holodeck to care for a family rather than satisfy \\"an intellectual curiosity about a period of history\\". Commentators have contrasted the holonovel with other characters' use of the holodeck.Murray (1997): p. 16 Academic Janet Horowitz Murray cited Janeway's appreciation of the gothic novel with Captain Jean-Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart)'s interest in film noir, Lieutenant Commander Data's (Brent Spiner) identification with Sherlock Holmes, and Dr. Julian Bashir's (Alexander Siddig) preference for James Bond. Murray wrote that unlike the men who find enjoyment in \\"violent conflict[s] that [are] resolved within a single Star Trek episode\\", Janeway immerses herself in domestic chores without pursuing a narrative with constant action. A. Bowdoin Van Riper, a historian specializing in modern science and technology, wrote that Janeway Lambda one was the only time a holonovel used by a woman was shown on screen, and identified Janeway as \\"the only Starfleet officer whose fantasies are of home, hearth, and children\\". Taylor attributed the holonovel, specifically in \\"Persistence of Vision\\", as allowing Janeway to move forward from her engagement to her fianc√©e Mark Johnson (Stan Iver). In regards to Janeway's personal life, Taylor said: \\"We cannot put her into romantic situations until she decides he has given her up for dead and moved on, and the only wise thing for her to do is the same\\".Dillard & Sackett (1996): p. 218 Van Riper cited Janeway as part of a trend in which fictional female captions \\"recreate home and hearth on the high seas by forming (and maintaining committed romantic relationships. Murray interpreted her romance with the fictional Lord Burleigh as a serious \\"exercise posing psychological and moral questions\\" for the audience and characters to explore during the episodes. She likened Janeway with the character Jane Eyre based on their \\"strong resistance to being bullied, a willingness to stand on principle, and the courage to face fear and isolation head-on\\". Referring to Janeway as a \\"person of Victorian integrity\\",Murray (1997): p. 25 Murray described the holonovel as opening a channel of exploration that brings her the \\"benefit of self-knowledge\\" in order to return her to \\"the real world all the stronger\\".Murray (1997): p. 26  Critical reception  Janeway Lambda one was panned by television critics. The A.V. Clubs Brandon Nowalk viewed Janeway's holonovel as unsuccessful, and called Lord Burleigh a \\"holographic Irish bodice-ripper stereotype\\". In his book A Critical History of Doctor Who on Television, John Kenneth Muir compared the show's allusions to Jane Eyre to those shown on the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Muir criticized the holonovel as \\"essentially a time-waster\\" that \\"serves no dramatic or character purpose except to enlighten the viewer that Janeway likes Victorian novels\\". While Muir praised Doctor Who for immersing its characters in the Victorian time period, he felt that the Davenport narrative was kept separate from the rest of the narrative and characters.Muir (2007): p. 315 Io9's James Whitbrook ranked Janeway Lambda one as number nine on its list of recurring Star Trek holodeck programs, and described it as \\"dull as dishwater\\". Critics were divided on how the holonovel fit into Janeway's role as a female captain. Whitbrook considered the subplot to be an excuse to portray Mulgrew out of her Starfleet uniform. TrekToday's Michelle Erica Green dismissed the holonovel as a failed assertion that Janeway was \\"not just a captain, she's a WOMAN!\\", writing that it invoked \\"all sorts of ugly cliches about how women secretly want to be swept off their feet by men who consider themselves their superiors\\". She criticized Janeway's investment in the holonovel over leading her crew, and questioned her portrayal in the show's early seasons as \\"isolating herself on the holodeck and holding junior officers at arm's length\\". In response to a fan's criticism that Janeway was too busy \\"prancing around in frilly dresses on the holodeck\\" to be an effective captain, Tor.coms Sara Eileen Haines responded: \\"Wait, Janeway wears frilly dresses? Wait, you mean Janeway was a girl under that uniform?\\" American studies professor Katja Kanzler interpreted the holonovel as the show's way of adding \\"ultra- traditional images of femininity\\" to its \\"ultra-authoritative female Captain\\". Kanzler recommended that Janeway should be seen a \\"work-in-progress\\" and a \\"project in which authors test and playfully combine different narratives of gender, power and social interaction\\".Kanzler (2004): p. 180 The show's expansion of the holodeck technology received negative feedback. National Reviews Jonah Goldberg wrote that the frequent use of the holodeck was \\"an outrage, seemingly conceived for actors and costume designers to indulge themselves at the audience's expense\\". Nowalk described the various appearances of the holodeck in Voyager as representing how the writers were \\"fascinated with, concerned by, and curious about virtual reality in the early days of the Internet\\". Murray expanded on theoretical physicist Lawrence M. Krauss's determination that creating tactile simulations through the holodeck is an example of unrealistic technology to write that Janeway would have been unable to drink tea and hug Lord Burleigh in reality. Green was critical of how the holodeck technology was written as a means for \\"personal gratification\\" rather than as a space to further develop a skill or hobby.

It is dedicated to Saint Sabbas the Sanctified. Origins and rebuilding The first church on the site was built soon after 1583, when Greek monks from Mar Saba asked Prince Peter the Lame for a plot of land where they could raise a church. Once their request was granted, the monks built a church dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God, along with cells, thus forming a monastery. Placed under the protection of Mar Saba, it acquired the Jerusalem monastery's name. It is believed that Peter contributed to building the church, given his appearance in a votive portrait and in prayers of commemoration. The clearest reference to the church comes in a letter written by Michael the Brave in June 1600. Due to the monastery's wealth, the administration of Moldavian properties belonging to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was located there until the 1863 secularization of monastic estates in Romania. Narcis Constantin Axinte, History at the Saint Sava parish site Problems with the land on which it was built caused the first church to deteriorate rapidly, a process accelerated by the Tatar invasion of 1624. Another theory holds that the church burned in early April 1616, along with all but 600 of the city's 20,000 houses, in a fire caused by »òtefan IX Tom»ôa. Whatever the case, an entirely new church was built in 1625. Its ktitor was postelnic Enache Caragea, of Greek origin and related to the regnant prince, Radu Mihnea. He donated nearly twenty villages or parts of villages to the monastery, making it among Moldavia's wealthiest. Caragea died in 1632 and was given a lavish headstone inside the church, which does not survive. The bell tower was added at a later, undetermined date. There are three dedication plaques, one in Old Church Slavonic and two in Greek. The first surviving description is from Paul of Aleppo later in the 17th century. 17th and 18th centuries In 1676-1678, Prince Antonie Ruset, a distant relative of Caragea's, rebuilt the surrounding wall, of which the eastern part still survives. Archaeological excavations carried out in 1976-1979 found that the original church was quite similar to the second one, that the newer one was built further to the north and that both were used as burial grounds including over 300 graves. Research also determined that the area was used for ceramic production from the 15th century until shortly after 1500, when a powerful fire destroyed the workshop. Caragea died without descendants, and by the mid-17th century, the monastery was in the hands of the noble Palade family, with several of its members being buried on the site through the 19th century. Three of their graves are in the vestibule; a fourth has an illegible inscription, but may belong to the architect Ianachi. It was the Palades who removed Caragea's grave, just as he had removed the graves of the 1583 founders. When the Peloponnesian archimandrite Grigore repaired the church in 1820, he left a plaque portraying himself as the sole ktitor. Such historical amnesia had the approval of the church, which benefited from substantial contributions in exchange for allowing donors to claim the status of founders. Due to its importance, the monastery hosted various foreign visitors. These included Jerusalem Patriarchs Theophanes III (1617 and 1618), Nectarius (1664) and Dositheos II (1670 and 1673), as well as Antioch Patriarch Macarios III Zaim (1653). In 1619, Neofit of Rhodes translated the Life of Saint Sabbas into vernacular Greek; his book was donated to the monastery. In 1714, during the reign of Nicholas Mavrocordatos and upon the advice of Chrysanthus of Jerusalem, the Princely Academy of Ia»ôi opened on the site. A Slavonic and Romanian printing press as well as a library were also opened; in 1744, Sylvester of Antioch arranged for printing in Greek and Arabic as well. After secularization, the library, which included over 800 volumes, was given to the recently established university library. Tradition holds that galleries existed beneath the church and were used in cases of need to hide locals' property and the monastery's valuables, and could even be used to hold liturgies. Large feasts were held for Saint Sabbas' day (December 5), both in people's houses and outside. Moreover, the Greek monks distributed gifts of objects and money every month to the poor and the sick. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site Later history and collections After 1863, the monastery scaled back its cultural activities, although a school opened in the archimandrite's residence the following year. By 1877, this had become a girls' school, housed in a new building. The monastery was converted into a parish church after clergy reform in 1893. The parish closed in 1951 but reopened in 1958. The church features a two-room museum that includes 80 books from the 18th and 19th centuries and valuable religious objects such as a Polish-inscribed bell from 1570, an a√´r from 1842 with Greek writing, an 18th-century wool curtain sewn in Byzantine style, 19th-century vestments, icons and liturgical items. There is a large Slavonic Gospel book printed at Moscow in 1637 and coated in silver and gold at Ia»ôi in 1642. Coins, ceramics and jewelry unearthed in the 1970s are also kept there. A large icon of Saint John Chrysostom in the nave is from 1711. The Renaissance interior painting done in fresco-secco in 1832, largely destroyed over time, was reworked in neo-Byzantine style from 2010 to 2013. The 19th- century iconostasis, featuring rich Baroque carvings, was restored in the same period. After Dancu Monastery was demolished in 1903, the relics of Saint Tryphon and Saint Marina were transferred to the church. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, as are the nearby ruins and the protective wall.

History  * 2015 - BCIT is founded * 1986 - The Peter Thomson Centre for Venture Development is created * 1997 ‚Äì The Downtown Vancouver campus opens * 2001 - Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) donates $1.5 million to create the BCE New Media Centre of Excellence * 2014 - Centre of Excellence in Analytics is created Programs The BCIT School of Business + Media offers over 130 credentials that can be completed full-time, part- time, or online. Certificates ladder into diplomas, which ladder into degrees. =Diplomas= The School of Business + Media has over 20 diploma programs that cover a wide range of business and media specializations. Some of the specializations include marketing communications, operations management, human resource management, accounting, and web development. Diplomas are completed in two years full-time or course-by-course on a part-time basis. =Bachelor Degrees= BCIT offers Bachelor of Business Administration and Bachelor in Accounting degrees. Students must complete a BCIT diploma program to enroll into a degree program. Students can complete a bachelor degree within three years by completing a two year diploma program and one additional year of business studies. Degree students can complete an international student exchange for a term or year. =Graduate Certificates= BCIT offers two graduate certificate programs. The Graduate Certificate in Business Administration is a one year full-time program that transfers into a number of international MBA degree programs. The Graduate Certificate in Analytics is completed in the evenings over a one year period.  Campuses  = Burnaby Campus = The Burnaby campus offers the majority of academic programing. Bachelor degrees, two year full-time diplomas, and part-time certificates are taught at the campus. The main campus is located at 3700 Willingdon Avenue, Burnaby. = Downtown Vancouver Campus = The Downtown Vancouver campus offers part-time business courses. The BCIT Downtown Vancouver Campus is located at 555 Seymour Street, Vancouver.  BCIT Learning Model  The BCIT School of Business + Media applied business education model prepares graduates for a business career. Students learn in a set of 25‚Äì30 other students during the year. Unlike universities, students are automatically enrolled in all of the courses required for that program once accepted into their program. Students maintain a heavy course load consisting of six to eight courses each semester. BCIT semesters are slightly longer than other local universities with the academic year ending in May and graduating in late June. = Business Consulting Projects = Business Consulting Projects are 10‚Äì16 weeks in duration and provide students the opportunity to work in a consulting role for a real business. A Business Consulting Project is different from traditional co-op or internship programs, as students fill an outside consulting role for an organization. = Internships and Practicums = During the final semester in the diploma programs, students participate in an internship or practicum. An internship program can help students apply their classroom knowledge in a work environment. = Advanced Placement and Prior Learning = BCIT provides course credit and advanced placement into diploma and degree programs. In 2014, the BCIT School of Business + Media provided course credit to McDonald's managers who completed courses through McDonald's own corporate training program. In 2015, the Royal Canadian Legion, donated $830,000 to the School of Business to fund the BCIT Legion Military Skills Conversion Program. This program helps Canadian veterans and reservists convert their military skills and knowledge into a business credential.

In August 2016, it was announced by the Northern Irish government that Air Ambulance NI was partner with the health service in Northern Ireland to provide the helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS). The charity works in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to provide the aviation side of the service and fund the non-medical costs of HEMS, with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service being commissioned to provide the clinical staff, equipment, clinical governance arrangements and operational tasking. The service is primarily based at Maze Long Kesh near Lisburn, with a spare aircraft at the secondary base at St Angelo Airport in County Fermanagh. The helicopter has the call sign Helimed 23 in keeping with the Helimed callsigns of all UK air ambulance helicopters, and will typically transfer patients with serious injuries to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, Northern Ireland's major trauma centre. History Historically, Northern Ireland has been the only part of the United Kingdom and Ireland, without air ambulance provision and several previous attempts to introduce a HEMS failed. A comprehensive report published in February 2004 argued against the provision of an air ambulance service from Scotland in favour of either a separate Northern Ireland service, or one provided as part of an all Ireland coordinated system. The trustees of the AANI came together in December 2013 to commence the process of forming a charity-led company to run an air ambulance. Independently, in late 2013, Dr John Hinds and other members of the Northern Ireland Regional Faculty of Prehospital care began discussing ways of encouraging the development of a fully-fledged HEMS at a time when the only air support for casualty evacuation was from either Coastguard or PSNI helicopters. After a near fatal accident at the North West 200 motorcycle race in May 2015, Dr Hinds' views received widespread support and he began a public campaign for Northern Ireland to have its own air ambulance. In March 2016, the key findings of a HEMS consultation were announced. In August 2016, it was announced by the Northern Irish government that Air Ambulance NI would partner with the health service in Northern Ireland to provide the helicopter emergency medical service. The clinical model has from the outset been based on a doctor and paramedic working in partnership, with the doctors seconded from consultant tier emergency medicine and anaesthetic/critical care physicians across Northern Ireland. The doctors undertake the HEMS role on a part-time basis alongside their primary posts in order to maintain clinical and organisational skills on both fronts. The paramedics were drawn from within the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and alongside the doctors have undertaken a comprehensive training programme encompassing clinical skills, crew resource management and flight operations training. The service was scheduled to go live in August 2017, but actually undertook their first live mission on 22 July 2017 during of one of their final training flights, when they were deployed to a child seriously injured in a farming accident near Castlewellan. The child was transferred by helicopter to the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. Funding In March 2016, Air Ambulance NI were successful in applying to the Chancellor of the Exchequer‚Äôs banking fines fund, and were awarded ¬£3.5million to establish and support the HEMS service in Northern Ireland. A further ¬£1M in matched funding thereafter was also pledged. The charity need to raise circa ¬£2M each year to sustain the service.

Biography In 1898, Pfahler graduated from the Medico-Chirurgical College. By the next year, he was an assistant chief resident at Philadelphia General Hospital. The hospital's board of managers procured an X-ray machine, then known as a roentgen ray machine, and they appointed Pfahler to operate it. The young doctor had set out to become an internal medicine physician, and at first he doubted whether X-rays would have much value in the clinical care of patients. The rest of Pfahler's career was defined by his focus on direct patient care applications of X-rays. After residency, Pfahler spent the early years of his medical career as a clinical professor at the Medico-Chirurgical College and as the director of the radiology departments at Philadelphia General Hospital and the Medico-Chirurgical Hospital. The Medico-Chirurgical College merged with the University of Pennsylvania in 1916, and Pfahler became a professor and vice dean of radiology at that institution. He worked at the medical school through 1946, and afterwards he was an emeritus professor. He made advances both in diagnostic radiology and in radiotherapy, taking special interest in radiation treatment for oral and breast cancers. Pfahler was the 1910-11 president of the American Roentgen Ray Society, and he was the president of the American Radium Society in 1922. The next year, he became the first president of the American College of Radiology (ACR). He won the ACR Gold Medal, the organization's highest award, in 1952.

He served on the faculty at New York University School of Medicine in the early 1950s, became the Chief of Dermatology at the Washington University School of Medicine in 1955, and was a founding member of the MIT Center for Cancer Research (now called the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research). Eisen retired and assumed professor emeritus status in 1989, but continued to be active as a researcher; he was working on a manuscript the day he died in 2014.  Early life and education  Eisen was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1918, one of four children of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His undergraduate studies at New York University began in 1934 but were interrupted by a case of tuberculosis, which required him to withdraw from school for a year; he later recalled this as a key event in his life inspiring him to focus on intellectual activities. After graduation in 1939, he began as a medical student at NYU and received his M.D. in 1943. He worked briefly as an assistant in pathology at Columbia University, where he was first exposed to immunology research by Michael Heidelberger. He then returned to NYU again for his residency. Eisen was one of the first recipients of a new form of National Institutes of Health fellowship for physician-scientists, which supported further work at NYU with Fred Karush studying antibodies. Eisen next moved to Sloan-Kettering to work with David Pressman and left after a year to return to NYU as a faculty member.  Academic career  Eisen's first faculty position was at NYU in the then-new Department of Industrial Medicine, where he was funded to work part-time as a researcher and invest the remainder of his time in clinical practice. He found this combination unsustainable and therefore was receptive when approached by Barry Wood to recruit him to Washington University School of Medicine as the Chief of Dermatology there. Eisen moved to Washington University in 1955 and spent five years in the position before moving to the department of microbiology and serving as its chair. Following the National Cancer Act of 1971, Salvador Luria recruited Eisen to become one of the founding members of MIT's new Center for Cancer Research, where Eisen would spend the rest of his career. Eisen officially retired in 1989, assuming professor emeritus status, but remained active in research and in mentoring younger scientists in the MIT community. During this time he worked with a number of MIT colleagues on their ongoing projects, including Jianzhu Chen and Arup Chakraborty. Eisen was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1969, and a member of the Institute of Medicine in 1974. He served as the president of the American Association of Immunologists in 1968‚Äì69 and received the organization's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.  Research  Eisen's research is regarded as foundational in the field of immunology. After his death, he was remembered as \\"the last of the great immunochemists\\". He is particularly well known for his studies of affinity maturation of antibodies beginning in the late 1950s while he was at Washington University. Much of this work was conducted with postdoctoral fellow Lisa Steiner, who went on to become the first woman in the MIT Department of Biology. In the 1980s Eisen changed research interests from a focus on antibodies to a focus on T cells and cell- mediated immunity.  Personal life  Eisen's wife Natalie was also a physician and practiced as a pediatrician in New York, served as assistant director of Bellevue Hospital in St. Louis, and then practiced at the Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center in Boston. The couple had five children. Eisen remained an active research scientist for many years following his official retirement and was working on a manuscript related to antibody affinity the day he died in 2014.

It is approximately long and flows through Wilmot Township in Bradford County, Colley Township in Sullivan County, and North Branch Township and Forkston Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek has eight named direct tributaries, including hollows. In the 1940s and 1950s, the average discharge for September was found to be just , but was found to be over for July and August. North Branch Mehoopany Creek has a deep, narrow valley, with \\"rough and hilly\\" topography. The upper reaches of the creek's watershed contain swamps and small lakes. Although forested land is the most prevalent land use in the creek's watershed, agricultural land is also present. A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek. Its watershed is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The creek has wild trout naturally reproducing within it. Course North Branch Mehoopany Creek begins in Wilmot Township, Bradford County. It flows south for several tenths of a mile, flowing through an unnamed lake, before turning southwest and then south-southeast, entering Colley Township, Sullivan County and crossing Pennsylvania Route 87. After several tenths of a mile, the creek turns east-southeast for several tenths of a mile before receiving the tributary Wolf Run from the left. It then meanders south for a few tenths of a mile to receive the tributary Smith Cabin Run from the right. The creek then flows east, continuing to follow Pennsylvania Route 87. After more than a mile, it turns southeast and then east again for several tenths of a mile. It then turns northeast for several tenths of a mile, receiving the tributary Barnes Brook from the right and the tributary Scotia Brook from the left and turning east. North Branch Mehoopany Creek then enters North Branch Township, Wyoming County and flows east-northeast for a few miles, still following Pennsylvania Route 87. It receives the tributary Miller Brook from the left and then turns east-southeast for more than a mile, receiving the tributaries Burgess Brook from the left and Douglas Hollow from the right. The creek then turns east-northeast and enters Forkston Township, where it turns east- northeast. After several tenths of a mile, it turns east for several tenths of a mile, receiving the tributary Farr Hollow from the left and turning south. A short distance further downstream, the creek reaches its confluence with Mehoopany Creek. North Branch Mehoopany Creek is approximately long. The creek joins Mehoopany Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology and climate Between 1942 and 1958, the average annual discharge of North Branch Mehoopany Creek near Lovelton ranged from in 1954 to in 1948. Between December 1940 and September 1958, the months of the year with the highest average discharge were April and March, with discharges of , respectively. The months of the year with the lowest average discharge were September and July, with discharges of . The highest average discharge for an individual month was , which occurred in April 1958. The lowest was , which occurred in September 1941. In the early 1900s, the average annual rate of precipitation in the watershed of North Branch Mehoopany Creek is . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of North Branch Mehoopany Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the creek's source is above sea level. The topography of the watershed of North Branch Mehoopany Creek has been described as \\"rough and hilly\\". The creek has a deep and narrow valley flanked by steep hills. In the early 1900s, the creek's valley was noted to be very fertile. Near the headwaters, there are swamps and small lakes. The creek has a channel that is sinuous and flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. The bedrock in the watershed of North Branch Mehoopany Creek consists entirely of sandstone. The Arnot-Oquaga-Dystrochrepts soil association occurs between North Branch Mehoopany Creek and Mehoopany Creek. In the 2000s, accelerated erosion of streambanks and lateral shifting were identified at five locations on North Branch Mehoopany Creek. This was caused by man-made alterations after Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972 and other flooding events, as well as dredging in the creek. Remedying this would reduce the sediment load of Mehoopany Creek. Watershed The watershed of North Branch Mehoopany Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Forkston. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Meshoppen. The creek's mouth is located within of Forkston. There are of streams within the creek's watershed. The watershed of the creek occupies parts of Wyoming County, Sullivan County, and Bradford County. There is a pond known as Saxe Pond in the upper reaches of the watershed of North Branch Mehoopany Creek. The pond has a dam in Wilmot Township, Bradford County. Pennsylvania Route 87 runs alongside the creek for much of its length. There is a stream gage on the creek near Lovelton, at an elevation of above sea level. The creek drains an area of at this point. The main land use in the watershed of North Branch Mehoopany Creek is forested land, but there are significant areas of agricultural land as well. The watershed of the creek contains 10 drilled wells and another 14 permitted wells. North Branch Mehoopany Creek is the largest tributary of Mehoopany Creek, forming approximately a third of the creek's watershed. History North Branch Mehoopany Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1193036. The creek is also known as North Fork Mehoopany Creek and North Fork Mehoppany Creek. The latter variant name appears in a 1983 county highway map created by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. However, in 1969, civil engineer Ronald W. Hurs was unable to find any evidence that locals referred to the creek as \\"North Fork Mehoopany Creek\\". Deeds dating back to about 100 years before that all called the creek \\"North Branch Mehoopany Creek\\". North Branch Township probably takes its name from the creek. The first road in North Branch Township, Wyoming County was built from Forkston up the valley of North Branch Mehoopany Creek. In the early 1900s, the main industry in the watershed of North Branch Mehoopany Creek was agriculture. Major communities in the creek's watershed at the time included Lovelton, with 136 people, and Colley, with 75 people. The creek was used as water power for a gristmill at Lovelton in the early 1900s. A two-span prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying State Route 3001 over North Branch Mehoopany Creek was built in Forkston Township, Wyoming County in 1987 and is long. A steel stinger/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T-410 over the creek was built in Colley Township, Sullivan County in 1925 and is long. In 1973, a 21-year-old man drowned in North Branch Mehoopany Creek. When the Mehoopany and Little Mehoopany Creek Watershed Assessment was completed by Borton-Lawson in 2003, North Branch Mehoopany Creek was identified as \\"problem area\\" in need of restoration. However, by 2013, projects were being done to stabilize the banks of the creek. The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research was planning on installing a real-time continuous monitor on the creek, but flooding has made these plans uncertain. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in North Branch Mehoopany Creek from its upper reaches downstream to its mouth. The drainage basin of the creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A total of of streams in the creek's watershed are designated a Natural Trout Reproduction, while are Trout Stocked. In the 1980s, the creek was noted to be best for trout fishing in the early part of the season. North Branch Mehoopany Creek is stocked with trout. In the 1980s, it was stocked with brook trout, brown trout, and rainbow trout. Stocking occurs in both Wyoming County and Sullivan County. In the 2000s, a total of 31 species of fish were observed in the creek, including darters, daces, suckers, and bluegills. North Branch Mehoopany Creek is too small to support viable hellbender populations, even at its mouth.

The border rivals have faced off on the gridiron since 1893, making it one of the oldest series in major college football. It was close in the early years, with Kentucky holding a series lead after the first 22 match-ups, but since the early 1930s, Tennessee has dominated the cross-border rivalry. Tennessee fans and Kentucky fans in the stands for the 2010 game. Both schools were charter members of the Southeastern Conference when it was established in 1932. Since that season, Tennessee has a 53‚Äì14‚Äì3 record against Kentucky, including a streak of 26 straight victories from 1985 to 2010, which is one of the longest such streaks in NCAA history. The Wildcats did not win any games against the Volunteers during the 1940s, 1990s, or 2000s. The only decade of the SEC era in which UK posted a winning record against Tennessee was the 1950s, when they went 6‚Äì3‚Äì1. The series was not without disappointment even during that period for Kentucky fans, however, as the Vols dealt Bear Bryant's 1950 Wildcat squad its only defeat during its school-best 11‚Äì1 season. The Barrel =History of the trophy= The Kentucky‚ÄìTennessee game once involved a trophy: a wooden beer barrel painted half blue and half orange which was awarded to the winner of the game every year from 1925 to 1997. The Barrel was introduced in 1925 by a group of former Kentucky students who wanted to create a material sign of their school's supremacy in the rivalry. It was rolled onto the field that year with the words \\"Ice Water\\" painted on it to avoid any outcries over an alcohol drum symbolizing a college rivalry during the Prohibition era. While the trophy was ceremonially awarded to the game's winner each year, it took some unauthorized trips over the years. Tennessee lost to Kentucky in 1953, but several orange-clad students \\"keg-napped\\" the barrel and kept it hidden in Knoxville until UK students retaliated by \\"dog-napping\\" Smokey. The barrel theft set in motion a series of additional pranks over the next few years between students of the two schools, but the barrel was not involved. Vanderbilt University students stole the keg from Kentucky in 1960 to rally support from cross-state UT students in an upcoming basketball game against Kentucky. The Commodores lost the game and returned the trophy months later. =End of the Barrel era= A fatal alcohol-related car crash involving two UK football players a week before the 1998 contest prompted the end of the barrel exchange. Kentucky athletic director C. M. Newton expressed the idea that the ongoing use of an alcohol container as a trophy would be inappropriate under the circumstances. The ceremony was cancelled for the 1998 game, and the two schools mutually agreed to permanently discontinue the tradition before the 1999 game. The actual barrel was in UT's possession when the schools ended the exchange, but its current whereabouts have not been made public. It has not been displayed since 1997, and it was not transferred to Kentucky when the Wildcats broke the Volunteers' long series winning streak in 2011. On November 12, 2019, Tennessee's tight ends coach Brian Niedermeyer posted a photo of the barrel on Twitter. Game results Notable games *1950: The Vols handed #3 Kentucky, coached by Bear Bryant, its only loss 7‚Äì0. Tennessee went on and defeated #2 Texas in the Cotton Bowl Classic 20‚Äì14 en route to an 11‚Äì1 record, and Kentucky defeated Oklahoma 13‚Äì7 in Sugar Bowl, while also finishing 11-1. The 2007 game between the 2 teams. *2007: Tennessee came to Lexington looking to clinch the SEC East and a trip to Atlanta after a strong victory over Georgia and after Florida stumbled midway through the season. Kentucky came in with one of its strongest teams in years behind star QB Andre Woodson and a huge upset over then-ranked #1 LSU now looking to end the 22-game losing streak to the Volunteers. The game was a fierce, nail-biting, overtime thriller as Woodson fought to end Kentucky's misery against Tennessee. In the second overtime Tennessee failed to score, giving Kentucky a chance to finally end the streak, but the Cats' field goal attempt was blocked. With the score at 44‚Äì44 an unsportsmanlike penalty on UT RB Arian Foster forced Tennessee to start the fourth overtime from the UK 40-yard line, but it was rendered moot as QB Erik Ainge hit WR Quintin Hancock with a touchdown strike on the first play. Tennessee would then make the two-point conversion. On Kentucky's possession RB Derrick Locke scored from three yards out to bring Kentucky within a two-point conversion to keep the game alive. Woodson kept the ball himself on the try, but was stopped from behind short of the goal line for the Volunteer victory. As a result, Tennessee and Georgia finished their seasons with identical 6‚Äì2 records to lead the SEC East, but the Vols would move on to the SEC title game by virtue of the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Bulldogs. Tennessee would then lose the following week to the eventual two-loss national champion LSU. *2008: This was Phillip Fulmer's final game as Tennessee's head coach. Fulmer finished his career off with his final victory over the Wildcats, 28‚Äì10, leaving Kentucky winless against him. *2009: Tennessee and Kentucky went to overtime once again after another nail-biting game ends tied at 24‚Äì24 in regulation. Kentucky relied on star receiver Randall Cobb for most of the game, however Cobb was ineffective on the Wildcats' first possession in overtime only taking one wildcat formation snap. After a three-and-out the ensuing field goal missed wide left. On the Vols' ensuing possession, RB Montario Hardesty broke off a 20-yard run for the game-winning touchdown in Lane Kiffin's lone victory against the Wildcats. *2011: After losing 26 straight games to Tennessee the Wildcats finally notched a 10‚Äì7 victory against the Volunteers behind the play of wide receiver Matt Roark who was forced to play under center as both quarterbacks, Maxwell Smith and Morgan Newton, were out with injuries. The loss is often regarded as one the most embarrassing to Vol fans and one of the many black marks in the Derek Dooley era. Dooley himself took the blame for the loss in an interview with Clay Travis in 2016, saying the team just wasn't ready to perform. *2020: Kentucky ended a 17-game road losing streak in Neyland Stadium with a dominant 34‚Äì7 win over the Volunteers. Kentucky's defense had 2 interceptions returned for touchdowns in the game. This was the Wildcats first win in Knoxville since 1984, Kentucky's largest victory over Tennessee in the series since 1935, and the Wildcats' largest victory over the Volunteers in Knoxville since 1924. Mark Stoops became the first Kentucky coach to beat Tennessee in both Lexington and Knoxville since Fran Curci.

It is a history of the American inventors and aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright. The book was on The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers list for seven weeks in 2015. Production McCullough first became interested in writing a book on the Wright brothers while researching for his book The Greater Journey, which explored the history of various notable Americans who lived in Paris during the 19th century. In an interview with The Seattle Times, McCullough recalled, \\"I didn't know when (chronologically) I was going to end that book, and who do I run into in France but the Wright brothers.\\" He continued, \\"I was delighted to find that Wilbur, at every chance, went to the Louvre to look at paintings, and the degree that he was moved by the great Gothic works of France was far beyond that of an ordinary tourist. [...] Much of what has been written about the Wright brothers (in French) has been ignored. That's what pulled me into doing the book.\\" McCullough has had a lifelong interest in aviation. In an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent, he remarked, \\"I loved to make model airplanes when I was a young boy and I took flying lessons later on; I would have continued if they weren‚Äôt so expensive. But I have to say in all candor that I knew very little about [the Wright brothers]. I knew they were from Ohio, I knew they were bicycles mechanics, and I knew they invented the airplane. But I really didn‚Äôt know anything beyond that of any substance...\\" He added, \\"Once I got into their lives and into all that they went through and the truly admirable human qualities that they personified, I would have wanted to write the book even if they hadn't succeeded in inventing the flying machine.\\" Reception The Wright Brothers has been praised by literary critics and historians. Janet Maslin of The New York Times described it as a \\"concise, exciting and fact-packed book [that] sees the easy segue between bicycling and aerial locomotion, which at that point was mostly a topic for bird fanciers and dreamers.\\" She added, \\"Mr. McCullough presents all this with dignified panache, and with detail so granular you may wonder how it was all collected.\\" In The New York Review of Books, the novelist James Salter wrote, \\"Having twice won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for his best-selling histories and biographies, McCullough is a much-loved dean of Americana, and his new book, a dual biography, has a warm appeal.\\" Writing in The Washington Post, Reeve Lindbergh, daughter of the famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, called The Wright Brothers a \\"superb new book\\" and wrote, \\"McCullough's magical account of their early adventures ‚Äî enhanced by volumes of family correspondence, written records, and his own deep understanding of the country and the era ‚Äî shows as never before how two Ohio boys from a remarkable family taught the world to fly.\\" Bruce Watson of the San Francisco Chronicle observed, \\"The Wright Brothers will do more than help Americans tell Orville from Wilbur. Fighting the persistent myth of invention's 'aha' moment, McCullough shows the importance of experiment, error and inspiration in nature. Although they studied early gliders, Orville and Wilbur also watched birds. 'Learning the secret of flight from a bird,' Orville said, 'is a good deal like learning the secret of magic from a magician.' Likewise, to learn history from a master storyteller is to relive the past.\\" Bob Hoover of the Star Tribune was slightly more critical of the work, remarking, \\"Although this new biography, The Wright Brothers, refreshes their often-told story in McCullough's upbeat, minutely researched manner, something's lacking ‚Äî interesting characters. While the brothers accomplished their goal of powered flight, they missed out on the stuff that makes life interesting ‚Äî relationships, children, hobbies, fun and, most of all, self-reflection.\\" He concluded, \\"Despite their old-fashioned manners and plain style, the Wright brothers were reticent and difficult people, traits that McCullough seemed unwilling to explore in his search for the virtues and strengths he values so much in American life.\\" Buzzy Jackson of The Boston Globe similarly described it as \\"a tidy and relatively short history\\" of the Wright brothers and praised the author's attention to detail, despite noting, \\"While there is much to like here, McCullough's gee-whiz attitude toward America's favorite flying Boy Scouts does feel a bit retro.\\" References External links *C-SPAN Q&A; interview with McCullough on The Wright Brothers, May 31, 2015 Books by David McCullough 2015 non-fiction books Wright brothers American history books History of aviation Simon & Schuster books ","title":"The Wright Brothers (book)"},{"id":"51421256","title":"Hande Er√ßel"},{"id":"51421272","text":"The Indiana‚ÄìKentucky football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Indiana Hoosiers and Kentucky Wildcats.

Description and history The Southview Housing district is located on the southern side of the town center of Springfield, between South Street and the Black River. Extending south from Stanley Street's junction with South Street are eighteen wood frame multi-unit residential buildings. Fifteen are two stories in height, with hip roofs and vinyl siding, while the other three are single- story buildings with novelty siding and gabled roofs. Most of the buildings on the west side of Stanley Street are arrayed perpendicular to the street, while those on the east side are arrayed parallel to it. Each building houses either three or four residences, most of which are two-story duplex style units. with The development was erected in 1942, after the federal government took the land (a farm at the time) by eminent domain. They were built to house workers at several of Springfield's precision machinery manufacturers, who were producing equipment critical to the production of military hardware. It was one of two such developments built by the government in Springfield; the other, called Westview, survives only in significantly altered form.

Biography Yegor Irodov was born on June 30, 1966, in Kiev, to physiologist parents Mikhail Irodov and Ninelle Irodova, both of whom were contributors to the development of Ukrainian sport‚Äîathletes trained by them provided Ukraine with a large quantity of Olympic medals. At the age of 6, Yegor began playing the piano. In 1980, he was awarded a gold medal when graduating from a musical school, and that same year enrolled into the K. Stetsenko Musical School of Jazz, attending with Konstantin Vilensky. In 1981, Yegor began performing on stage in the Union of Ukrainian Composers and other concert halls across the country as one half of a jazz duet with Alexey Kolesnichenko, and various other jazz outfits. In 1984, he graduated from the K. Stetsenko Musical School of Jazz with a Gold medal. During his service in the army, Yegor participated in the military's orchestral division, where he learned musical orchestration and arrangement. From 1987, he began working with the Krasnodar State Philarmony as the musical director of the group Tandem, and of the parodist Vladimir Chistyakov. During that time, he also worked with Igor Matvienko, Sergei Mazayev, Nikolai Rastorguyev (as part of the collective Zdrastvuyi Pesnya, the Kuban Cossack Choir, and Grigoriy Ponomarenko. In 1989, Yegor left Tandem to join a group named Zodchiye as their keyboardist and musical director, relocating to Moscow ‚Äì Zodchiye went on to tour the USSR and abroad. Irodov was responsible for all of the arrangements during his tenure with the band, in addition to their musical style. At that time, the groups political lyrics landed them on the Black List of the USSR's komsomol and the party's \\"recommendations\\". Zodchiye claimed then to be taking part in an attempt to \\"nail in the final nails on the coffin of European communism.\\" The group's success was propelled via Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika policy, which allowed the TV show Vzglyad to fund the band's music videos, gaining the support of the new political vanguard. This step had gotten the group booked in virtually every concert hall in the former Soviet Union, with the likes of Aleksey Glyzin, Yevgeny Margulis, the group Lyube, Rondo, participating in the Alla Pugachyeva Theater of Song, etc. Overtime, as Zodchiye's lyrics became less politically charged, popular interest in the band waned. Parallel to his work in Zodchiye, Yegor worked as an arranger with artists and bands such as Tamara Gverdtsiteli, Alyona Sviridova, Olga Kormukhina, Oleg Gazmanov, Igor Gataullin, Alexander Barykin, Alexander Shevchenko, Andrey Marioli, the groups Super R, Vesyolye Rebyata, Eskadron, etc. In 1991, collaborating with the composer Viktor Reznikov, the singer Mikhail Muromov, and the leader of Zodchiye Yury Davidov, Yegor took part in founding the \\"Starko\\" Russian Pop Star Football Club as its chief administrator. The charitable aims of this project had inspired many of its members to donate to sick children all over the country. Yegor left the organisation in 1996, citing dissatisfaction with its impediment on his creativity, and relocated back to Kiev, where he began working as a songwriter and arranger with local acts and artists as Nikolai Mosgovoi, Aurika Rotaru, Irina Skazina, Oksana Khozhai, the guitarist Sergo Chanturia, Tina Karol, Anyuta Slavska, Natalie Volkova, the groups Man Sound, KARE, 12th Floor, the Roma theatre Romance, and many others. In addition, he began working with television projects and commercials, with over 700 compositions recorded. In 2002, Yegor began to study film audio production under Lyubov Tselmer, going on to become the first dual sound producer-film composer in Ukraine. As a result, his first film, European Convoy (directed by Andrey Benkendorf), received critical acclaim. In 2004, Yegor took part in ABBA's 30th Anniversary, in Vilnius, Lithuania, working as the musical director and sound producer of the event, thereby halting his music-making career and dedicating his time to audio post-production for film and television. From 2006, he has been working as the head of the audio department in the largest film corporation in the CIS, ¬´STAR MEDIA GROUP¬ª. As of now, Yegor has been the sound producer behind over 50 films and television series which have been shown and broadcast over many countries throughout Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, the United States, Israel, and others. Many of his productions went on to win awards as well as first place in various international contests. Currently, he is enrolled in the Berklee College of Music.

She has also been the face for the Tunisian travel agency Traveltodo since 2013. 2015 controversy However, in 2015 her future involvement with the company and other tourism campaigns, was called into question over comments she made on a radio station where she admitted that she had previously prevented her friends from visiting Tunisia due to the current political instability of the country and security threats. Stating the following; \\"They have nothing to do in Tunisia. We couldn't invite people into such unsafe conditions ... We couldn't put the lives of others in jeopardy\\"' General management of Traveltodo responded by stating that her remarks were inappropriate, because they undermined the tourist reputation of Tunisia and its image on an international scale.

It is dedicated to Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki. The church was built in 1690 by medelnicer Iona»ôcu Bal»ô (1663-1738). Belonging to the Moldavian style, it was devastated by fire in 1723; the blaze began in a nearby brick workshop or, according to other sources, in the church itself. Bal»ô and his son Lupu rebuilt the church, adding stone walls and a new roof. Initially, the building was entered through an open terrace on the south side; its remnants can still be seen in the stonemasonry. There was a niche with an icon of Saint Demetrius, now partly hidden by a window. In 1781, a foyer was added on the western side, with a bell tower above. At that point, the entrance was moved to the west, through the closed foyer under the tower, while the other door was shut up behind a wall. For a long time, members of the Bal»ô family financed the church, which had a separate administration, even though it was a filial of the Saint George-Lozonschi Church. Various princes of Moldavia, particularly members of the Mavrocordatos family, offered gifts to the parish. Short history at the Saint Demetrius-Bal»ô parish site In 1857, a grave was built for the Bal»ô family in the vestibule, gathering remains from the cemetery in the churchyard. In 1900, eight headstones of the family were brought in from the cemetery and placed in the foyer walls. Five are in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet, two in Greek and one is almost completely effaced. The plate for the crypt, made of Carrara marble, was vandalized by an individual who removed the Greek letters of gilt metal. A professor attempted to decipher the inscription in 1902, but could only make out a few words. At that point, another plaque was set up; the refurbishment was carried out by Gheorghe Bal»ô. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site Damaged by fire and earthquakes over time, the church was restored in 1897 by administrator Mihail Bal»ô, following the plans of architect Iancu Catargiu. This is mentioned in a dedication above the entrance, and at the same time, a white marble plate with the names of several deceased was also installed. Serious repairs were undertaken in 1948-1952 in order to fix damage caused during World War II. New renovations took place in 1994-1998; the iconostasis was repaired and the interior was repainted in neo-Byzantine fresco. The church has two bells from 1690 and 1692, while the iconostasis was carved in classic Baroque around 1800. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs. Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Jude»õul Ia»ôi File:Biserica Sf.

Biography Thomas Henry Thornton was born in 1832, the son of a Times journalist, and educated at Merchant Taylors' School and read Classics and Modern history at St John's College, Oxford, at which he was afterwards a fellow. In 1855, Thornton entered the Indian Civil Service in the last few years of the East India Company as one of the first officers selected by competition. He was posted to the Punjab and played a small but distinguished role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, noted in Roberts Forty-one Years in India. Thornton had been returning from a visit to Philour fort, north of Ludhiana, as part of his work for George Ricketts, the Deputy Commissioner, when he came upon Indian soldiers of that fort and Jalandhar (Jullunder) marching in revolt on Ludhiana. Rather than return to the fort for protection, he rode on, cut the cables of a bridge of boats over the Sutlej River, and continued to Ludhiana to raise the alarm. In 1864, at the comparatively young age of 32, he was appointed Secretary to the Punjab Government, a post he held for 12 years. He filled Charles Umpherston Aitchison's foreign secretary post during the former's furloughs back to the UK. Thornton assumed responsibility for the organisation of the 1877 Delhi Durbar, the success of which, together with his service to date, led to the conferring on him of the award of Companion of the Order of the Star of India. However Thornton and Aitchison were both identified as proteges of John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence, the Viceroy of India from 1864 to 1869, whose policies were opposed by Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton, Viceroy from 1876 to 1880. Aitchison transferred to Burma, and Thornton was passed over for promotion into Aitchison's vacant role. He now became a judge in the Punjab Chief Court and a member of the Legislative Council, retiring in 1881 after the completion of 25-years of colonial service, at the very early age of 49. In his long retirement, he wrote two well-regarded biographies of key British India figures, Robert Groves Sandeman and Richard John Meade. He was a member and sometime chairman of the Wandsworth magistrates bench, and vice-president of The Asiatic Society at the time of his death.

Lehman is known in his field for his enhancements of three firing techniques: long-wood- fire, side-fire and saggar-fire. These have yielded dramatic-looking pottery pieces, some of which reside in ceramics galleries and museums in the United States and elsewhere.Everson Museum Collection; Arizona State University Permanent Collection; Ceramics Monthly Magazine Permanent Collection; Northern Arizona University Permanent Collection; University of Northern Iowa Permanent Collection; Bermuda National Gallery; 35 personal collections in Japan. This list came from Lehman's curriculum vitae, found at http://dicklehman.com/html/story/resume.html on August 31, 2016. In September 2016, the cover of Ceramics Monthly featured a close-up of a multi-colored, highly textured piece by Lehman that the magazine noted was thrice wood-fired. This was the third time his work was featured on the cover of Ceramics Monthly.The other Ceramics Monthly covers featuring Lehman's works were March 2005 and April 1996. Long-Wood-Firing Lehman has written extensively about his visits to Japan, where he began in 1992 to learn from master potters knowledgeable in ancient firing techniques; in turn, Lehman was invited to exhibit his work there.Lehman, Dick, \\"Shiho Kanzaki: Extending the Tradition,\\" Ceramics Monthly, June‚ÄìJuly‚ÄìAugust (summer), 1997, was one of the first of about a half-dozen articles by Lehman on Japanese pottery, including two installments in Ceramics Monthly, November and December 2007, titled \\"Japanese Friendship and its Influence on an American Potter.\\" These writings found at http://dicklehman.com/html/writing/index.html. Japan's Shiho Kanzaki, in particular, has been a major influence.Yellin, Robert, The Japan Times, October 28, 2000. http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/kanzaki-shiho-jt.html At Kanzaki's invitation, Lehman's work was featured in two-person exhibitions in Japanese cities known for their clay and traditional porcelain, Shigaraki, Shiga, and Tamba in 1999.Lehman, Dick, \\"Two Tuna Fish and an Auction ‚Äì The Gift of Hospitality Across Cultures,\\" Ceramics Monthly, March 2009, retrieved from http://dicklehman.com/html/writing/Twotunafishandanauction.php. Kanzaki fires his anagama kiln for 10 days; his pots are placed into the kiln unglazed and come out with a natural ceramic glaze from the flying ashes. \\"The prolonged firing allows for a slow build-up of ash and melted surfaces into undesigned patterns known as keshiki (landscapes).\\"Yellin, Robert, The Japan Times, October 28, 2000. http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/kanzaki-shiho-jt.html. To achieve Kanzaki-type effects without stoking a kiln at frequent intervals for 10 days, Lehman experimented for nearly three years with combining a then- new \\"step-down\\" grate design from New Zealand with a firebox which is almost as large as the kiln itself. The result was a new kiln that could be stoked less frequently for six days, followed by intensive stoking for 36 hours. Lehman thus produced pottery featuring ash glaze and design unique to the United States, yet evocative of tradition-rooted Japanese pottery and porcelain.Lehman, Dick, \\"An Approach To Long-Woodfire\\", Ceramics: Technical (Australia), November 1999. Retrieved from www.dicklehman.com/html/writing/longwood.html. > The result of Lehman‚Äôs brand of lateral thinking was a kiln that required > stoking only five times a day over a period of six days before a final push > to temperature over a 36-hour period.

With Troy, Lehman writes, \\"I had the first of several experiences wood-firing anagama-style kilns. The exuberance of the four-day firings; the altered shapes propelled by the pyroplasticity of the clay; the expressions of kinetic energy exuded by the ash runs, drips and pools ‚Äì all these new experiences convinced me that pursuit of my dream would inescapably lead to my own anagama-style kiln.Lehman, Dick, \\"Side-Firing ‚Äì Where the Life Is,\\" Ceramics Monthly magazine, 1996, retrieved from http://dicklehman.com/html/writing/sidefire.html This kiln is described under Long-Wood-Firing, but an additional development was the technique of side- fired glazed ware. > At a time when he was without access to a large wood-burning kiln, Lehman > had become more and more transfixed on the idea of making pots that > displayed the ‚Äòkinetic‚Äô qualities of molten ash that he had seen in Japan. > In particular he had seen wares from Shigaraki with their emerald-green ash > runs and pyroclastic bulges, effects that he was later to achieve in ‚Äòlong‚Äô > firings....

Saggar-Firing Traditionally, closed-container saggars have been used to shield ceramics from the direct contact of flames and from damage by kiln debris. Lehman, however, pioneered using a saggar for the opposite purpose: to encapsulate ceramic pieces within a particular atmosphere: \\"My approach to saggar-firing is to wrap pots in fresh vegetation and place them in the saggar on their sides, atop a bed of sawdust. I then cover the pot entirely with sawdust and place the lid on the saggar. During the firing, due to the presence of heat and pressure ‚Äì and due to the relative absence of oxygen ‚Äì the vegetation turns to 'activated charcoal', and in the process, releases a film of carbon. When everything works just right, the film of carbon penetrates the porous porcelain pot. The images you see on the pots are the result of that 'carbon transfer', similar to the fossil-formation process called 'carbonization.'\\"Lehman, Dick, \\"Fast Fossils: Carbon-Film Transfer on Saggar-Fired Porcelain,\\" Ceramics Monthly, March 2000. Retrieved from http://www.dicklehman.com/html/firing.techniqes/saggarfire.html In Ceramics and Print, Paul Scott explains Lehman's contribution to saggar-firing:Scott, Paul, Ceramics and Print, second edition, A&C; Black (London) and University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002, p. 73-74. > The Swedish ceramist Herman Fogelin has referred to the kiln as a sort of > washing machine. [Gerry] Caplan and others use it as a printing press, > imparting color and other unique qualities. The kiln, in generating heat, > can facilitate either the transfer of color from one body to another, or > causes a print by reducing clay and carbonizing matter.... Dick Lehman‚Äôs > carbon film transfers on sagger-fired porcelain using the same basic > chemical principles as Caplan's, but in this case the materials, process and > intention are different‚Ä¶The sagger is...closed with a lid. In the firing a > receding (or anaerobic - no oxygen) atmosphere is created inside the sagger, > and the vegetation turns into activated charcoal, in the process releasing a > film of carbon which the biscuit porcelain absorbs, capturing the image > released by the vegetation. In Electric Kiln Ceramics, Richard Zakin elaborates on how the effects of rake and \\"smoke-reduction firings\\" can be achieved through using a simple electric kiln, rather than more elaborate wood-fired kilns. He specifically names Dick Lehman and Gerry Caplan with pioneering this approach:Zakin, Richard, Electric Kiln Ceramics: A Guide to Clays and Glazes, second edition, Chilton Book Co., Radnor, PA, USA; and A&C; Black, London, 1981, pp. 143-144. \\"Smoke-reduction firings require the use of a saggar, which is a sealed container placed inside the firing chamber. A bed of flammable material such as sawdust is placed in the base of the saggar and the ware is placed on top. More flammable material is packed around the piece. The saggar is then put into the kiln and fired. As it burns, the sawdust carbonizes the surface of the piece, creating a rich, highly varied surface.\\" Zakin notes that this offers modern ceramic artists the \\"convenience and flexibility of the electric kiln\\" while also allowing them to \\"exploit the right and complex effects of smoke reduction.\\" Lehman's success rate with saggar-firing is less than 20%, according to Paul Scott. Nevertheless, the interesting results of the technique \\"propel him to continue exploring the process.‚ÄùScott, Paul, Ceramics and Print, second edition. A&C; Black (London) and University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002, p. 73-74. Other Contributions Lehman's career began with what he has called \\"production pottery\\" ‚Äì that is, reliably reproducible hand-thrown pieces that would be attractive to paying customers: \\"To run a studio business with living wages for up to five people for 30 years is a great accomplishment. I am proud of that.\\"Hartenberger, Craig, \\"Work, Play, and People\\": A Conversation with Dick Lehman, Studio Potter Magazine, Vol 41 Number 2, 2013, pp 85-94.

She has served on national committees such as the USDA National Advisory Committee on Biotechnology in the 21st Century (AC21) and was awarded the 2014 Borlaug CAST Communication Award. Van Eenennaam writes the Biobeef Blog.  Education Van Eenennaam began her university career at the University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1987, receiving a BS (Honors) degree in Agricultural Science. She received a Master of Science degree in Animal Science in 1990, and a Ph.D in Genetics in 1997, both from University of California, Davis. Career Van Eenennaam began her work in animal science as an intern at Genetic Resources Inc.'s Bovine Reproduction Facility in San Marcos, Texas in 1984. From 1991 to 1993 she worked as a livestock and dairy farm advisor for the UC Cooperative Extension in the San Joaquin and Sacramento Counties of California. From 1998 to 2002, following the completion of her Ph.D degree, Van Eenennaam worked for Calgene (purchased by Monsanto Corporation in 1997) in Davis, California, first as a research scientist, and then as a project leader. Since 2002, Van Eenennaam has been a Cooperative Extension Specialist in the field of Animal Genomics and Biotechnology in the Department of Animal Science at University of California, Davis. She has served on several national committees including the USDA National Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture, (2005‚Äì2009), and was a temporary voting member of the 2010 FDA Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee meeting on the AquAdvantage salmon, the first genetically engineered animal to be evaluated for entry into the food supply. Research The mission of Van Eenennaam's animal biotechnology lab is to \\"provide research and education on the use of animal genomics and biotechnology in livestock production systems\\", with a focus on beef cattle production. Van Eenennaam's biotechnology lab at UC Davis is working on a collaborative project focused on the production of hornless dairy cattle through gene editing on a USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture grant. This project involves using a gene sequence from Angus cattle in the genome of dairy cattle to prevent horns from growing. Van Eenennaam stated that the use of genetics rather than chemicals to solve problems can address some of the animal welfare concerns and environmental impacts of animal production. In October, 2016, this project was featured on Science Friday. Funding sources for this research and extension program are found on Van Eenennaam's public website. Van Eenennaam was appointed to the Food and Drug Administration Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee evaluating the AquAdvantage salmon, a genetically engineered fish. A paper, authored in 2006 by Van Eenennaam with Paul Olin of University of California Cooperative Extension Sea Grant, discussed transgenic fish. The paper cites a number of benefits of genetically engineered fish, including a larger number of eggs laid per female, a low probability of carrying human pathogens, strong markets for aquaculture, and increased feed-conversion efficiency. This paper also describes the risk factor that these fish could escape breeding locations and mix with wild fish populations. In 2014 Van Eenennaam co-authored a review article on the use of genetically modified feed for cattle. The data represented more than 100 billion animals in 29 studies and found \\"GMO feed is safe and nutritionally equivalent to non-GMO feed\\". Science outreach Van Eenennaam won two awards from American Society of Animal Science. One was for the 2013 video Gene Shop, a five-minute parody of Macklemore‚Äôs ‚ÄúThrift Shop‚Äù in which Dr. Van Eenennaam and UC Davis students engagingly emphasize the importance of funding for agricultural research. The second award was for the 2012 video Were Those the Days My friend?, a take on a ballad from the 1960s that highlights the importance of genetic advances for improved production efficiency and food security. This competition was designed to further the \\"goal of sharing the importance of animal science with the public\\".

Abdi died in an incident with the Ottawa Police Service. Background Abdi had come to Canada from Somalia in 2009. He worked at a local car wash, though he was unemployed in the months leading up to his death. At the time of his death, he was 37 years old. Following his death, Abdi's family described him as someone with mental health issues. Arrest and death At approximately 9:30 a.m. on July 24, 2016, police were called to the Hintonburg Bridgehead coffee shop on the corner of Fairmont Avenue and Wellington Street West over allegations that Abdi was groping women there. (updated July 30) J.M. Duval, a witness who was present at the coffee shop since 9:15 a.m., said he saw a commotion and that the front doors were locked as a group outside restrained Abdi. Duval said it looked like Abdi was trying to either flee or get back into the shop. Duval asked the allegedly assaulted woman (who had been taken to the back of the shop) in French what had happened and she repeatedly said (translated) \\"He groped me.\\" Tracey Clark, the owner of Bridgehead who was not present during the incident, gave a statement on August 5 after speaking with staff and customers, describing Abdi as having harassed and assaulted multiple people in the shop. Clark mentioned this was not the first incident with him and that he would sometimes stare at customers and get too close to them. Clark said that they had previously intervened by asking Abdi if he was aware of what he was doing and if he could stop. After the Bridgehead confrontation, police pursued Abdi 250 metres (three blocks) and arrested him outside his apartment building at 55 Hilda Street. During that encounter, Abdi began to suffer \\"medical distress\\". Dispatchers sent an ambulance at 9:52 a.m., and a paramedic reported \\"vital signs absent\\" at 9:59 a.m. Abdi was later taken to the Ottawa Civic Hospital where a doctor informed the family he had died 45 minutes prior to arrival. His death was announced to the public at 3:17 p.m. on Monday, July 25. SIU investigation As required under the Police Services Act, the provincial Special Investigations Unit (SIU) conducted an investigation into the incident. The SIU is required to investigate all reports of deaths, serious injuries, or sexual assaults in relation to provincial or municipal police officers. Two Ottawa Police Service officers who were involved in the arrest ‚Äì Constable David Weir and Constable Daniel Montsion ‚Äì were designated as subject officers during the course of the investigation. Constable Weir was later re-classified as a witness officer, while Constable Montsion would be charged with manslaughter. On March 6, 2017, the SIU laid charges against Constable Daniel Montsion for manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon in relation to the death of Abdi. On October 20, 2020, Montsion was found not guilty on all charges. Aftermath The Abdi family retained lawyer Lawrence Greenspon two days after his death on Wednesday July 27. Abdi's funeral was held on Friday, July 29 at the Ottawa (Main) Mosque, with 800 inside and more outside. Naeem Malik, President of the Ottawa Muslim Association, estimated total attendance at over 2,000 people. The funeral was led by Imam Mohamed Hachimi and a family statement was read by Imam Sikander Hashmi of the Kanata Muslim Association. Mayor Jim Watson spoke at the funeral. The Canadian Somali Mothers' Association called for two officers to be removed and the Canadian Council of Muslim Women requested a critical look at the case. In late August, Black Lives Matter's Toronto chapter protested the SIU in Mississauga in response to Abdi's death.

In that capacity, he presided over the Manitoba Court of Appeal from 1990 to 2013. Among his most notable decisions are those in the cases Rebenchuk v Rebenchuk (2007), Manitoba M√©tis Federation Inc v Canada (Attorney General) et al. (2010), O‚ÄôBrien v Tyrone Enterprises Ltd (2012), and, while he was on the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba, R v Lavallee.  Early life and career  Scott was raised in St. Vital, Manitoba, in what has since become a neighbourhood of Winnipeg. He had wanted to become a test pilot, but as his eyesight was not good enough, he turned to law. He attended the University of Manitoba, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959 and a Bachelor of Laws degree and a Governor General's Academic Gold Medal in 1963. He married his wife Mary with whom he went on to have three daughters. Scott had started working for Thompson, Dilts, Jones, Hall, Dewar & Ritchie in 1961 and became an associate following his call to the bar in May 1963. He later became a partner in the firm (which adopted their current name, Thompson Dorfman Sweatman, in 1973) and was appointed as Queen's Counsel in 1976. He was the chairperson of the civil litigation subsections of the Canadian Bar Association and the Manitoba Bar Association from 1975 to 1978, he sat on the board Legal Aid Manitoba from 1976 to 1982, and he was a bencher of the Law Society of Manitoba from 1980 to 1984, serving as its president from 1983 to 1984.  Court of Queen's Bench  Scott stayed with Thompson Dorfman Sweatman until 1985 when he was appointed to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba. He appointed to the bench on June 28, 1985, and was promoted to be the Associate Chief Justice of the court three months later on October 4. In 1990, he served as the trial judge in R v Lavallee, a case which was ultimately heard by the Supreme Court of Canada and which granted legal recognition to battered woman syndrome as a defence. The decision has been described by legal scholar Richard F. Devlin as \\"monumental\\".  Chief Justiceship  On July 31, 1990, Scott was appointed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal as the tenth Chief Justice of Manitoba, succeeding Alfred Monnin. = O'Brien v Tyrone Industries = Among Scott's most notable decisions while sitting on the Court of Appeal was in O'Brien v Tyrone Industries (2012). In the personal injury case, the plaintiff's lawyers were representing her for a contingency fee and were \\"not prepared to front the costs of the medical and actuarial witnesses who would be required when the issues of damages were addressed unless the defendant was found to be liable.\\" As the plaintiff's only income was the $7,000‚Äì7,400 per year which she received from her disability pension through the Canada Pension Plan, the plaintiff could not cover these costs herself and therefore applied for severance of the civil trial on liability and damages. Such applications are rarely granted in Manitoba, in accordance with Justice Guy Joseph Kroft's decision in Investors Syndicate v Pro-Fund Distributors Ltd which held that it is the \\"normal preference of the court ‚Ä¶ to hear and determine all issues at one time and to discourage the piecemeal trial of actions.\\" However, Kroft acknowledged that severance may be granted in \\"appropriate circumstances\\" and provided a series of considerations that should be weighed by judges. Taking this into consideration, the motions judge, Justice Albert L. Clearwater, overturned the decision of the master and allowed the application, holding that: Scott dismissed an appeal of the severance, citing the \\"modernization\\" of the Court of Queen's Bench Rules that took place since Investors Syndicate (including the amendment of Rule 1.04(1), under the heading \\"General principles\\", to read \\"These rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits\\") and the \\"trend, or evolution, in [the jurisprudence of other] provinces towards a more liberal approach to severance\\" with which he agreed. He wrote:  Post-judicial career  Scott retired from the Court of Appeal on March 1, 2013, less than three weeks before he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 years. Following his retirement from the bench, he joined Hill Sokalski Walsh Olson as counsel on February 2, 2015, where he conducts an arbitration and mediation practice. In July 2017, he was appointed to the Supreme Court Advisory Board by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The board's mandate is to provide an independent, merit-based recommendation to fill the vacancy created by the upcoming retirement of Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin.

Linscheer held the national 50m freestyle record for 12-years until it was beaten by Renzo Tjon-A-Joe in 2013. His younger brother Enrico Linscheer also represented Suriname in swimming at the same two Olympics. Both Linscheer and his brother were educated in the United States, at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, then the University of Florida. Career At the 1991 Pan American Games he was a finalist in the 100 metres for the butterfly and freestyle, the two events he competed in at Olympic level. His first appearance at the Olympics came at Barcelona in 1992, at the age of 19. In the 100 metres freestyle he was fifth in his heat with a time of 51.82, which placed him 37th overall. He was also 37th overall in the 100 metres butterfly, sixth in his heat with 56.20. Countryman Anthony Nesty won the bronze medal in that event. He earned All-American honours while swimming for the Florida Gators in 1993-94, with a top eight finish in the 400-yard relay at the NCAA Championships. In 1994 he graduated from the University of Florida with an engineering degree. In Atlanta in 1996 he competed in his second Olympic Games. He registered exactly the same time in the freestyle as he had at the previous Olympics and was second in his heat, 41st overall. In the butterfly he also finished second in his heat with a time of 56.09, which placed him in 40th position. Later life Linscheer, who worked as a civil engineer, continued to live in Florida after his swimming career finished. In 2000 he died when his car was involved in a head-on collision on Interstate 95 in Boca Raton. Linscheer was driving a sport-utility vehicle that was heading the wrong way down the motorway with no headlights on and struck a Chevrolet van. The driver of the van was also killed.

Last week's episode spotlighted Hank and showed him getting back in the game while working on a case. But this week's plot didn't involve the Airstream until the final 10 minutes, instead featuring a didactic missive against military contractors given immunity from prosecution in American war zones. However, rarely has an episode of Grimm culminated in such an outright cool fight sequence that didn't involve the main characters. So as far as episodes like this go, 'The Good Soldier' is probably my favorite.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.7 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Manticores, looking like something I would fight against in a Final Fantasy game, came to Portland seeking vengeance in Grimm Season 3 Episode 11.

Negotiations began in September 2012, and mainly took place in Havana, Cuba. Negotiators announced a final agreement to end the conflict and build a lasting peace on August 24, 2016. However, a referendum to ratify the deal on October 2, 2016 was unsuccessful after 50.2% of voters voted against the agreement with 49.8% voting in favor. Afterward, the Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised peace deal on November 24 and sent it to Congress for ratification instead of conducting a second referendum. Both houses of Congress ratified the revised peace agreement on November 29‚Äì30, 2016, thus marking an end to the conflict. Background The Colombian armed conflict is the oldest ongoing armed conflict in the Americas, beginning - by some measures - in 1964 with the creation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), the largest of left-wing guerrillas groups which have operated in the country. In 1990 and 1991, peace negotiations with several smaller guerrilla movements resulted in their demobilization and transformation into civilian political actors. The first guerrilla group to demobilize following a peace agreement with the Colombian government was the 19th of April Movement (M-19), which demobilized and surrendered its weapons in exchange for blanket amnesty for all actions committed as part of the conflict. Other guerrilla groups which demobilized along similar conditions included most fronts of the Popular Liberation Army (EPL) and the Movimiento Armado Quintin Lame (MAQL). However, repeated attempts at finding a negotiated settlement through formal peace talks between the government and the FARC have all been unsuccessful. Prior to the current peace process, the most recent attempt at peace talks with the FARC was the 1999-2002 peace process under the government of President Andr√©s Pastrana, who had conceded a demilitarized zone to the FARC to facilitate peace talks within Colombian territory. Although the peace process continued for three years, no kind of agreement was reached between the two sides. Pastrana formally broke off all talks and ordered the military to retake control of the demilitarized zone on February 20, 2002, a few months before the 2002 presidential elections. The FARC had used the demilitarized zone as a safe zone to keep hostages, negotiate prisoner exchanges, train troops and plan offensive actions.The paralyzed peace process coincided with an escalation of the conflict, owing to a variety of factors including the rapid numerical and geographic expansion of paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) who opposed the government's negotiations with the FARC. The 1998‚Äì2002 period was one of the most violent periods in recent Colombian history, with the national homicide rate increasing from 58.92 (1998) to 69.69 per 100,000 inhabitants (2002).Observatorio del Programa Presidencial de Derechos Humanos y Derecho Internacional Humanitario de la Vicepresidencia de la Rep√∫blica. Tasa de homicidios por departamento y municipio a nivel nacional 1990-2013 In addition, there were 390 attacks on civilian settlements - the majority of them by the FARC; over 3,000 kidnappings each year between 1998 and 2002 and 898 massacres - mostly committed by paramilitary groups - killing over 5,400 people. Widespread popular frustration and disillusion with the peace process led to the election of √Ålvaro Uribe in May 2002, on a hawkish platform opposing any future dialogue without a prior cessation of hostilities and terrorist activities. As president, Uribe formalized these views in his policy of democratic security (seguridad democr√°tica), which redefined the conflict against the left-wing guerrillas as a war against terrorism and drug trafficking and vowed to \\"implacably punish\\" acts of terror, dismantle terrorist organizations and reassert the State's presence throughout the territory. As companion policies, Uribe adopted several individual and collective demobilization programs, promising pardons for political crimes and humanitarian assistance to fighters who submitted to its conditions. These decrees and laws, alongside the contentious Justice and Peace Law (2005), formed the legal basis for the demobilization of paramilitary groups between 2003 and 2006. As the FARC rejected Uribe's new policies, the government unleashed a large-scale military, political and judicial offensive against the guerrillas, resulting in a drastic reduction of their military capacity, albeit at the cost of grave human rights violations by the armed forces (\\"false positives\\"). The State's offensive forced the FARC to retreat to their hinterland, and achieved significant results such as securing the country's main roadways, a reduction in the number of kidnappings, a substantial drop in the homicide rate and the recovery of government authority in several regions of the country. Taken on the whole, these well-publicized results made Uribe extremely popular and granted him sufficient political capital to successfully seek congressional approval of a constitutional amendment allowing him to run for a second consecutive term in 2006. However, while the army and the police's operations recovered control of regions where the guerrillas had expanded their influence during the 1980s and 1990s, the FARC displayed a capacity to re-accommodate and reactivate themselves militarily in new strategic hinterland and border regions. The FARC showed their military resilience through terrorist attacks in urban environments (El Nogal Club bombing in 2003) and a counteroffensive in 2005. √Ålvaro Uribe was reelected in a landslide in 2006, and made the 'consolidation' of democratic security one of his major priorities for the second term. Between 2006 and 2010, the military struck significant blows to the FARC, and for the first time successfully targeted high-ranking members of the FARC's Secretariat. In March 2008, Ra√∫l Reyes was killed in a cross-border operation in Ecuador (which sparked a major diplomatic crisis), followed in May 2008 by the natural death of the FARC's historic leader Manuel Marulanda. In the midst of military blows, the FARC sought to maintain the political initiative by promoting a humanitarian exchange, and President Uribe bowed to public pressure in August 2007 by agreeing to discussions mediated by Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez. In November 2007, however, Uribe ended Ch√°vez's mediation. Henceforth, the liberation of hostages came through unilateral decisions by the FARC (Operation Emmanuel) with Venezuelan mediation or military rescue operations (Operation Jaque). Although no formal peace talks with the FARC were initiated under Uribe's presidency, informal contacts were clandestinely made. In 2012, as the current peace process began, El Tiempo related how Uribe had sought \\"secret approaches with the FARC in search of a peace process\\" until the final moments of his second term. In 2013, former Swiss mediator Jean Pierre Gontard stated that, in 2006, Uribe had ordered three small secret unilateral ceasefires to facilitate talks between both parties. In July 2008, following the rescue of 15 hostages by the Colombian military in Operation Jaque, the government made contact with the FARC, notably the organization's new leader Alfonso Cano, to offer them a \\"dignified\\" exit. Near the end of Uribe's term in January 2010, the then-High Commissioner for Peace, Frank Pearl, told U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield that he had opened channels of communication with the FARC to build confidence and prepare roadmaps for the next administration. In February 2010, according to a US diplomatic cable, intermediaries were preparing a meeting between government and FARC officials in Sweden. Nevertheless, as per another US diplomatic cable from February 2009 published by Wikileaks, President Uribe expressed skepticism towards the idea of reaching a negotiated settlement with the FARC in a meeting with then-United States Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg. Uribe judged that the FARC \\"would never negotiate as long as it enjoyed a safe haven in Venezuela coupled with a steady income from drug trafficking.\\" Indeed, Pearl's rapprochements with the FARC were abruptly interrupted by the FARC by the return of the human remains of colonel Juli√°n Guevara, held hostage for 12 years, in April 2010. Without militarily defeating them, Uribe had significantly weakened the FARC's ability to wage war and decimated its ranks. The FARC had over 20,700 armed men in 2002, a number which fell to just over 8,000 in 2010. Over the same period, attacks against civilian settlements, terrorist attacks, kidnappings and homicides all declined substantially. According to the Colombian government's 2010‚Äì2014 national development plan, the weakened FARC had \\"returned to guerrilla warfare in its most basic expression to hit, in an uncoordinated and sporadic way, the security forces, and intimidate the population.\\" In 2010, former defence minister Juan Manuel Santos was elected president with Uribe's support and on the general promise to continue consolidating Uribe's democratic security policies. In September 2010, Santos celebrated the death of FARC Secretariat member and military leader Mono Jojoy in a military operation, calling it the most important hit to the guerrilla group in its history. Nonetheless, Santos began distancing himself from his predecessor. In his inaugural address, Santos had declared that the \\"door of dialogue\\" was not \\"closed with lock and key\\", and made clear that his government would be open to dialogue with illegal armed groups who sought negotiations - albeit under certain conditions. In 2011, Santos' administration expended significant efforts in securing congressional approval of a landmark Victims and Land Restitution Law (Law 1448 of 2011), which granted official recognition to victims of the armed conflict and entitled victims to reparation measures including the right to land restitution. President Santos also worked to improve relations with Venezuela and Ecuador, which had been strained under Uribe's second term. As a result of mended diplomatic ties, Hugo Ch√°vez redefined his attitude towards the FARC and began advocating for a negotiated settlement, joining Cuba. Foreign support for the FARC's armed struggle was therefore at an historic low point, diplomatically isolating the guerrilla in the international arena. Peace process =Exploratory meetings= A number of secret exploratory meetings between representatives of the Colombian government and the FARC began taking place in the spring of 2011. The FARC report that the first of such meetings took place in March 2011 near the Colombian-Venezuelan border, with the guerrilla represented by Rodrigo Granda (the FARC's main international representative) and Andr√©s Par√≠s (a veteran political theorist and negotiator) and the government by presidential advisers Alejandro Eder and Jaime Avenda√±o. Two further meetings took place by July, where both parties agreed to continue exploratory meetings in Havana, Cuba. These first contacts were meant to settle the details of where, how and when the next stage of the process - secret encounters to set an agenda for talks - would be held. In July 2011, the government appointed senior officials to participate in the process: Frank Pearl, serving as environment minister; Sergio Jaramillo Caro, national security adviser to the president; and President Santos' brother Enrique Santos, former director of El Tiempo. For the magazine Semana, Enrique Santos' inclusion was a 'gesture of confidence' by President Santos to the guerrilla, because of the familial ties between the two men and Enrique Santos' past involvement in dialogues with the guerrilla. The FARC negotiating team was joined by Mauricio Jaramillo and Marcos Calarc√°. Secret negotiations continued despite the death of Alfonso Cano, the FARC leader, in a military operation in November 2011. Semana reported that both negotiating parties had agreed to the principle that nothing coming from the outside could influence the discussions, while the FARC states that its Central High Command had decided to continue the exploratory meetings, \\"for it was the will of Alfonso Cano.\\" Once the negotiators had been agreed upon, the two sides moved to designate foreign guarantor countries. Cuba, host to previous encounters, was a logical choice, while Norway was chosen as the second guarantor country for its active role in international conflict mediation. Additionally, two facilitator or 'accompanying countries' were also designated. The FARC chose Venezuela, while the Colombian government chose Chile. Exploratory meetings continued in Havana in February 2012, with limited social exchanges between the two negotiating teams to preserve the confidentiality of the talks. By August 2012, nearly ten preparatory rounds had taken place, with each round lasting between four and eight days for a total of approximately 65 encounters between both sides. The five main speakers for both sides remained in Cuba for the duration of the process. In February 2012, as a first public 'gesture of peace', the FARC announced by communiqu√© that it would henceforth proscribe the practice of extortive kidnappings, which it had 'legalized' by its ley 002 in 2000. In August 2012, former President √Ålvaro Uribe, who had become the leading critic of Santos' administration, affirmed that the government was negotiating with the FARC in the Cuba; claims which were denied by defence minister Juan Carlos Pinz√≥n and foreign minister Mar√≠a √Ångela Holgu√≠n. However, on August 27, TeleSUR broke the news that the government and the FARC were on the verge of announcing the signature of an agreement to begin formal peace negotiations, and President Santos later confirmed the information. In a televised address on September 4, Santos announced the signature of a 'general agreement' setting the rules and agenda for peace negotiations. He stressed that \\"past mistakes will not be repeated\\" by not demilitarizing any territory, not suspending military operations and by holding the peace negotiations outside of Colombia with international support. =September‚ÄîDecember 2012: General Agreement, delegations and installation of dialogues= A General Agreement for the Termination of the Conflict and the Construction of a Stable and Lasting Peace (Acuerdo General para la terminaci√≥n del conflicto y la construcci√≥n de una paz estable y duradera) was signed by representatives of the Colombian government and the FARC on August 26, 2012 in Havana, Cuba. The agreement set a road map for the initiation of a formal peace process, set the rules by which the negotiations would operate and established a five-point thematic agenda. The six thematic issues to be discussed are integral rural development, political participation, end of the conflict (including bilateral and definite ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, and surrender of weapons), solution to the problem of illicit drugs and victims; and ratification, implementation and verification. As per the agreement, each delegation is composed of up to 30 people, with up to 10 participating in sessions and five being plenipotentiaries. The discussions at the negotiation table are private, but periodic reports are issued and a mechanism to receive proposals from individuals and organizations was set up. One of the major principles of the negotiations has been that 'nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon'. Compared to past peace processes, the current peace process began with a defined agenda with a limited number of issues to be discussed. In addition, it was the first peace process with the FARC where the 'end of the conflict' and the surrender of weapons by the guerrilla was explicitly listed, and identified as the end goal. The delegation of the Colombian government is led by former vice president Humberto de la Calle as chief negotiator, flanked by the High Commissioner for Peace Sergio Jaramillo as well as Frank Pearl, business leader Luis Carlos Villegas, Enrique Santos Calder√≥n, Alejandro √âder, retired general of the National Police √ìscar Naranjo and retired Army general Jorge Enrique Mora. The FARC delegation is led by Iv√°n M√°rquez as chief negotiator, alongside Jes√∫s Santrich, Rodrigo Granda, Andr√©s Par√≠s, Marcos Calarc√°, Mauricio Jaramillo, Pablo Catatumbo, Tanja Nijmeijer and Sim√≥n Trinidad (currently in jail in the United States). The peace talks were formally installed in Oslo, Norway, on October 18, 2012, and moved to their permanent location in Havana in November. FARC chief negotiator Iv√°n M√°rquez's speech at the installation of dialogues in Oslo in October was interpreted by the Colombian media as unexpectedly radical for its defiant tone against the government, mentioning items excluded from the agenda (economic model, foreign investment, military doctrine, mining, land ownership) and defending the armed struggle. On November 20, 2012, the FARC announced a unilateral temporary ceasefire until January 20, 2013. The guerrilla announced it as \\"a solid contribution to strengthening the climate of understanding necessary for the parties to start dialogue and to achieve the purpose all Colombians ask for.\\" The peace process received the support of prominent left-wing governments in Latin America. President Hugo Ch√°vez, in one of his last statements in October 2012, aspired to see the FARC joining a peaceful political process. Rafael Correa, the President of Ecuador, endorsed the peace process as an opportune moment for the FARC to lay down their weapons. Bolivian President Evo Morales, in December 2012, said that the FARC needed to \\"exchange bullets for votes.\\" =2013= While discussions advanced on the first item on the agenda (integral rural development), the peace process faced its first major crisis at the end of January 2013 following the kidnapping of two police officers by the FARC in the Valle del Cauca on January 25. The incident was followed by a FARC ambush which killed four soldiers in the Nari√±o Department on January 31, and the assassination of another three police officers in La Guajira Department on February 1. The FARC claimed that these actions were in retaliation of a military bombing which left 20 guerrillas dead, during the FARC's unilateral ceasefire (which came to an end on January 20). Government negotiators in Havana argued that such actions undermined the peace process. In bringing the war to the negotiating table, both sides broke their previous understanding not to let events of the conflict affect the process, and the dispute escalated into a war of words between the two parties. The government, pressed by former President Uribe's fiery opposition to the peace process, sternly warned the FARC that it would respond in kind and would not be pressured into discussing a bilateral ceasefire (as demanded by the FARC). Despite these difficulties, negotiations on the first item continued. In March, a delegation of six members of Congress travelled to Havana to meet with the FARC negotiators and the encounter was described as productive and respectful. Senator Roy Barreras (Partido de la U) declared that the peace process was moving forward, to stages never reached in prior peace processes. On May 26, both sides announced a partial agreement on the first point, comprehensive rural reform. The agreement focused on the issues of land access and use, unproductive land, property titles, rural development, infrastructure, social development in rural regions, agricultural and livestock production, technical assistance, subsidies and credits, food and nutritional policies. Notwithstanding these advances, a new major point of difference between the government and the FARC emerged: the latter's insistence on a Constituent assembly to implement the results of a final agreement. For the guerrilla, a constituent assembly was the only way to change the political regime and reform political institutions, but the government maintained its steadfast opposition to the idea for the risks entailed by changing the Constitution. Several members of the government, led by chief negotiator Humberto de la Calle, made clear the government's opposition to a constituent assembly. To ratify a final agreement, the government proposed instead an existing form of citizen participation - a popular consultation, referendum or plebiscite. In August 2013, the government presented a bill organizing constitutional referendums necessary for implementation of the final agreement, hoping to hold it alongside the 2014 congressional elections (in March) or the presidential election (in May), which would require the signature of a final agreement by the end of 2013. The FARC, pushing for a constituent assembly, opposed the government's short time frame to close negotiations and announced a 'pause' in talks. Although talks eventually continued, frustration with the slow pace of the process and the approaching 2014 electoral campaigns led to media speculation about the possibility of talks being suspended or even broken off. The peace process was given a boost with the announcement on November 6 of a partial agreement on the second point of the agenda, political participation (with the issue of the constituent assembly unresolved). The FARC announced a second unilateral temporary ceasefire on December 15, 2013, valid through January 14, 2014. In 2013, the Colombian peace process received widespread support from the international community and world leaders, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonz√°lez, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Portuguese President An√≠bal Cavaco Silva and German President Joachim Gauck. =2014= In February 2014, the negotiations were rocked by revelations, made by Semana, that a military intelligence unit had illegally monitored the private communications of government negotiators in Havana. President Juan Manuel Santos declared the illegal interceptions 'unacceptable' and ordered a public investigation to determine if 'dark forces' were trying to sabotage the peace process. Within days, two generals including the head of military intelligence were dismissed and the attorney general's office began investigations. A partial agreement on another point of the agenda, illicit drugs, was reached on May 16, 2014. The developments in Havana were, however, overshadowed by the campaigns for the congressional elections (March 9) and the two-round presidential election (May 25 and June 15). Former President √Ålvaro Uribe, the leading opponent to the peace process, had founded his own party, the Democratic Centre (Centro Democr√°tico, CD) and led his party's list for Senate in March. The party's Uribe-led list won over 2 million votes and 20 seats, forming a solid opposition bloc in the new legislature, although parties supportive of the peace process retained majorities in both houses of Congress. The peace process became one of the main issues in the presidential race, with the promise of peace forming the basis of President Santos' reelection campaign while Uribe's Democratic Centre candidate √ìscar Iv√°n Zuluaga opposed the peace process. Zuluaga had said that he would suspend the peace negotiations until the FARC agreed to a permanent, verifiable unilateral ceasefire within 8 days, conditions judged to be realistically impossible. Additionally, Zuluaga claimed that there was no armed conflict but rather a 'terrorist threat' and asserted that issues such as agrarian reform and illicit drugs could not be decided with the FARC, \\"the main drug cartel in the world\\". Promising instead 'peace without impunity', Zuluaga said he was disposed to reduced jail sentences for those who had committed crimes against humanity but with political eligibility limited only to guerrilla fighters, not commanders. In the first round, Zuluaga did well with a first-place finish (29.28%) ahead of President Santos (25.72%). In his second round campaign, the incumbent president doubled down on the issue of peace, presenting the election as a choice between peace or endless war, and successfully put together a broad coalition for peace with endorsements from the left and centre-left, including that of Clara L√≥pez, the first round candidate of the left-wing Alternative Democratic Pole (15.21%), but also his 2010 rival Antanas Mockus and the left-wing Mayor of Bogot√° Gustavo Petro. Zuluaga was endorsed by Martha Luc√≠a Ram√≠rez, the first round candidate of the Conservative Party (15.52%). As a result of his alliance with Ram√≠rez, Zuluaga moderated his position on the peace process, agreeing to continue negotiations under certain conditions - an evaluation of what had been agreed upon and \\"tangible signs of peace\\" from the guerrilla. Santos was reelected in June with 51% against 45% for Zuluaga. The FARC declared two unilateral temporary ceasefires during the first and second rounds of the presidential election, between May 20 and 28 and again between June 9 and 30. In August, the first meeting between 12 victims of the conflict and the negotiators took place in Havana, an event hailed as a highly symbolic solemn exchange between the victims face-to-face with their victimizers. In a joint communiqu√© for the occasion, both sides reiterated that victims were at the core of the agreement. The second victims' delegation was received in September. Notwithstanding these encounters, victims of the FARC feeling that they had not been sufficiently taken into account organized a forum to have their voices taken into account. The forum brought together both opponents and supporters of the peace process. Beginning in July, a series of attacks by the FARC hit civilian populations particularly badly - bombings destroying electric pylons left Buenaventura without electricity, bombings on roads and water conduits cut off municipalities in the Meta and Guaviare from running water or communication for several days, a grenade attack by the FARC against a police officer killed his 3-year-old daughter while in the Putumayo the guerrilla forced tanker trucks to spill the crude oil they carried. President Santos warned the FARC that they were playing with fire, and that negotiations could not continue forever under such actions. On their side, the FARC threatened to leave the negotiation table if the government continued killing its commanders. The FARC also escalated their rhetoric, with Pablo Catatumbo blaming the state for the bulk of the victims of the conflict and justifying kidnappings, while the FARC's leader Timochenko complained in a statement that the media was making excessive demands on the guerrilla to face their victims and seek forgiveness. Despite these incidents, in Havana negotiations continued moving forward, with the creation of an historical commission on the conflict and its victims, an agreement to being parallel discussions on the 'end of the conflict' item and the installation of a sub-commission on gender issues. In late September, President Santos announced at the United Nations General Assembly that the government had decided to make public the agreements reached up till that point in Havana - including the joint drafts of the partial agreements on comprehensive rural reform, illicit drugs and political participation. The government said it was a transparency measure to end speculation and rumours about the contents of the agreements with the guerrilla. On November 16, the FARC kidnapped General Rub√©n Dar√≠o Alzate, commander of the Joint Task Force Tit√°n; Alzate was the first general to be captured by the guerrilla in the history of the armed conflict. President Santos ordered government negotiators not to travel to Havana until the hostages were released, while the FARC mostly highlighted the political implications of the kidnapping and used it to insist on the need for a bilateral ceasefire. Through mediation, facilitated by the guarantor countries and the International Red Cross, General Alzate was released by his FARC captors on November 30 and handed over to representatives of the Red Cross. As a result of General Alzate's kidnapping, both parties in Havana began talks on de-escalation of the conflict on December 12. On December 17, the FARC announced in a statement that they would be declaring an indefinite unilateral ceasefire beginning on December 20, which would end if guerrilla fronts were attacked by the authorities. This was the FARC's fifth unilateral ceasefire since 2012, and the first indefinite one. =January‚ÄîAugust 2015: Crisis and de-escalation= Between January and April 2015, peace negotiations in Havana showed signs of continued progress and growing international support. On February 20, United States Secretary of State John Kerry announced the appointment of a special envoy to the Colombian peace process, Bernard Aronson. The appointment was welcomed, including by the FARC, and interpreted as a clear endorsement of Colombia's peace process by the United States, long a key foreign player in the Colombian conflict. On February 27, former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan visited the negotiating table in Havana. On March 7, the negotiating parties in Cuba announced through joint communiqu√© the creation of a mine clearance pilot project, to clean and decontaminate land from the presence of anti-personnel mines, improvised explosive devices and unexploded ordnances with the leadership and coordination of the Norwegian People's Aid. The announcement was significant, as the FARC undertook to reveal the location of mines and suspending the planting of new ones in that territory, and it was the first aspect of the peace negotiations which would have an immediate impact on the ground. The pilot project was launched in the municipality of Brice√±o, Antioquia. On March 10, in a televised statement, President Santos recognized that the FARC had kept their word on the unilateral ceasefire and, as a gesture to de-escalate the conflict, ordered the Ministry of Defence and military commanders to cease the bombing of FARC camps for a month. 11 soldiers were killed in a FARC ambush in the Cauca on April 15, a crisis which threatened the future of the peace process and left many bewildered as to the reasons why the FARC had seemingly sabotaged the de- escalation process. The FARC negotiators in Havana justified the attack saying that the army had been advancing with reinforcements against a guerrilla camp, and denounced 'premeditated attacks' by the military but deplored the loss of life and reiterated their demands for a bilateral ceasefire. President Santos responded immediately by ordering bombings to resume. Within the government, the idea of imposing a deadline for an agreement grew in popularity, supported by Vice President Germ√°n Vargas Lleras and even by strong supporters of the peace process like senator Horacio Serpa and interior minister Juan Fernando Cristo. President Santos also mentioned the idea in a speech on April 17. The death of the 11 soldiers turned public opinion against the peace process and boosted the popularity of its main opponent, √Ålvaro Uribe. In an Ipsos poll, Santos' approval fell from 40% to 29% compared to November 2014, pessimism in the peace process increased 16 points to 69% during the same period and former President Uribe's favourable image increased from 41% to 57%. Nevertheless, only 27% of respondents in the poll wanted to break off dialogues and launch a military offensive. For a skeptical public, the FARC's attack was a sign that their ceasefire had been deceitful and only heightened frustration with a peace process which had recorded no formal agreement since May 2014. However, according to the Conflict analysis resource centre (Cerac), the attack on the soldiers was the only severe violation of the ceasefire, given that the FARC had generally complied with their ceasefire up to that point, resulting in the lowest levels of violence in the conflict since 1984. As a retaliation for the attack in the Cauca, a military operation in Guapi, Cauca killed 26 guerrillas of the FARC's 29th front on May 22. Days later, guerrilla commander and general staff member Rom√°n Ruiz was killed in the Choc√≥. The FARC called off their unilateral ceasefire declared in December 2014. Although it had been agreed upon that negotiations would take place in the midst of continued conflict, the end of the FARC's unilateral ceasefire was seen as putting the peace process in a critical moment which would lead to its end if not handled cautiously. Combined with President Santos' historically low popularity, the negotiations' loss of credibility and the strength of Uribe's opposition to the peace progress, the Havana talks appeared to be in dire straits. The crisis worried Cuba and Norway, the two guarantor countries, who called on the two sides to continue efforts at a negotiated settlement including an agreement on a definite bilateral ceasefire. The government shuffled its negotiating team in Havana. Luis Carlos Villegas was appointed Minister of Defence and left the negotiating team, replacing Juan Carlos Pinz√≥n who was sent as ambassador to the United States. Foreign minister Mar√≠a √Ångela Holgu√≠n was integrated into the negotiating team, as was Gonzalo Restrepo, former president of the Grupo √âxito. Following the end of the ceasefire, both sides made small gestures of peace, with Santos ordering that the bodies of guerrillas killed in combat be identified and returned to their families while the FARC reiterated their will to remain in the negotiations. A technical sub- commission for the end of the conflict began discussions about confidence- building measures, while the mine clearance pilot project began in Brice√±o (Antioquia), with Humberto de la Calle highlighting the historic nature of the military and the FARC working alongside one another. The FARC's negotiators in Havana and their leader, Timochenko, adopted a conciliatory tone. Analysts opined that the talks had reached a point of maturity where both sides appreciated their common objective and jointly protect what has been accomplished. On June 4, the negotiating sides created a commission for the clarification of truth, coexistence and non-repetition - the basis for an extrajudicial truth commission on the victims of the conflict. In Colombia, however, a wave of attacks by the FARC in June seemed to undo the progress made in Havana. Sabotage to energy infrastructure left Buenaventura and Tumaco without electricity, 13,000 barrels of oil were spilled in Putumayo, a power pylon in Caquet√° was bombed and a police colonel was assassinated in Ipiales. These attacks left over one million people without electricity, and the attacks against oil infrastructure created an environmental catastrophe. With these actions, the FARC had sought to regain the military initiative after the hits they suffered from the military in May and put political pressure on the government, but analysts judged that the guerrilla had miscalculated as it had further reduced their credibility in the eyes of the public. Cuba and Norway, the guarantor countries, placed pressure on both sides to begin de-escalating the conflict. The FARC responded, on July 8, by announcing a one-month unilateral ceasefire from July 20 (it has since been declared indefinite), and adding that they fully remained behind the peace process. Consideration of a bilateral ceasefire remained a more difficult question. On July 12, the government and the FARC negotiators in a joint communiqu√© entitled \\"Expedite in Havana and de-escalate in Colombia\\" announced a major agreement to de- escalate the conflict. Each delegation agreed to move towards a final agreement without delay by changing the format (to \\"a technical, ongoing and simultaneous work on the core items of the Agenda, while concurrently building agreements at the Table\\"), in particular on the terms of the final bilateral ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and surrender of weapons. Without agreeing to an immediate bilateral ceasefire, the government set in motion a de- escalation process of military actions consistent with the FARC's suspension of all offensive actions. In August, despite the unpopularity of the move, Santos ordered the suspension of bombings against the FARC. =September‚ÄîDecember 2015: Agreement on a Special Jurisdiction for Peace= On September 23, the government and the FARC reached an historic agreement on transitional justice (Special Jurisdiction of Peace or Jurisdicci√≥n Especial para la Paz). Adding to the historic nature of the agreement, President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC commander Timole√≥n Jim√©nez \\"Timochenko\\" travelled to Havana for the announcement, the first public encounter between a sitting President of Colombia and the commander of the FARC. The presidential delegation included the President of the Congress and Senate Luis Fernando Velasco, the President of the Chamber of Representatives Alfredo Deluque, senator and Liberal leader Horacio Serpa, senator Antonio Navarro Wolff (himself a demobilized guerrilla from the M-19) and senator Iv√°n Cepeda as well as Juan Carlos Henao and Manuel Jos√© Cepeda, former judges of the Constitutional Court who had played a major role in working out the agreement. The meeting ended with an unscripted handshake between President Santos and Timochenko, overlooked by Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro. Simultaneously with the agreement, the government also announced that a final agreement would be signed within six months, or by March 23, 2016. The agreement on transitional justice was the result of lengthy discussions between government and guerrilla lawyers in Havana and Bogot√°, which had begun in July working under Santos' ultimatum to reach such an agreement by November at the latest. Facing an impasse in Havana, the negotiators delegated the file to a group of six respected jurists - Spanish lawyer Enrique Santiago, Conservative politician √Ålvaro Leyva, human rights advocate Diego Mart√≠nez, former judge Manuel Jos√© Cepeda, University of Notre Dame professor Douglass Cassel and rector of the Universidad Externado de Colombia Juan Carlos Henao; the first three selected by the FARC, the latter three by the government. By September, the team of six had a text ready to be announced in Havana. The September 23 agreement on transitional justice was considered the most important moment in the peace process to date, because it resolved one of the most complicated issues through a formula satisfactory to both the guerrilla and the government, combining restorative justice with alternative sentences for guerrillas and agents of the State who have committed crimes against humanity with amnesty for those responsible of political crimes. With the agreement, the peace process was considered to be 'irreversible'. The announcement received acclaim internationally. Secretary of State John Kerry effusively praised the agreement, with his words even being relayed by FARC chief negotiator Iv√°n Marquez's Twitter account. Fatou Bensouda, prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, \\"noted with optimism that the agreement excludes the granting of amnesties for war crimes and crimes against humanity and is designed, among other things, to end immunity for the most serious crimes.\\" However, Human Rights Watch criticized the agreement, saying that it would exempt those responsible for the worst abuses from spending even a single day in jail, a view shared in Colombia by √Ålvaro Uribe. In Colombia, the announcement was greeted with cautious optimism. An Ipsos poll in October showed optimism in the peace process increasing from 29% to 46% since July, although majorities of respondents continued to doubt the FARC's commitment to peace and oppose their political participation. In mid-October, the negotiators announced immediate humanitarian measures for the search, location, identification and delivery of the remains of missing persons and the creation of a search unit for disappeared persons. The six-month window given to reach an agreement already appeared difficult to meet in November, due to delays in closing the transitional justice issue which became paralyzed despite the September 23 announcements because of different interpretations on thorny details between the two sides. On December 15, the final agreement on the fifth item of the agenda (victims), which includes transitional justice, was finally announced by the negotiating parties in Cuba. It built on the truth commission, the September 23 agreement on the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, as well as the October announcements on the search unit for disappeared persons. Disagreements between the government and the FARC continued on the mechanism for ratification of a final agreement. In November, the government gave its support to a bill submitted by senator Roy Barreras (Partido de la U) organizing a plebiscite on a final agreement. In Havana, the FARC responded negatively to the idea of the plebiscite, insisting on a constituent assembly. With the support of the government's congressional majority, the bill regulating the plebiscite was adopted by Congress in December 2015. As per the statutory law regulating the plebiscite, approval requires support equivalent to 13% of the registered electorate for the winning option, a one-time exception to the existing law regulating plebiscites (Law 1757 of 2015) which has a turnout quorum of 50%. The reduction of the quorum, and the change from a turnout threshold to a decision threshold, was controversial. Additionally, in the plebiscite voters would vote on the final agreement as a whole rather than article-by-article, something which also created some criticisms, primarily from Uribe's Democratic Centre. Following its adoption by Congress, the law passed to the Constitutional Court for a mandatory revision. =2016: Final Agreement= Another significant step towards achieving a final agreement was made on January 19, with the announcement of a trilateral mechanism for the verification and monitoring of a final ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and surrender of weapons composed of the government, the FARC and a political mission of the United Nations composed by observers from member states of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). The international component would preside and coordinate the mechanism. In other words, the negotiators asked the United Nations Security Council to create such a political mission with unarmed observers for a renewable 12-month period. The decision was highlighted by negotiators from both sides as an historic step towards the end of the conflict and confirmation of both parties' commitment to peace. Peace commissioner Sergio Jaramillo said that, with the UN Security Council involved, the government and the FARC would have to fulfill their obligations. FARC Secretariat member Carlos Antonio Losada, in an interview with Semana, noted that the bilateral ceasefire had been installed on the ground by the force of events and that no one would accept that this situation be reversed, specially with the UN involved. President Santos had previously contacted the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to secure their support, and the FARC had been convinced following consultations with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. In early February, the government and the FARC once again found themselves at odds, on the issue of the plebiscite. The FARC, by communiqu√©, argued that the plebiscite contravened the general agreement (from August 2012). In response, President Santos tweeted that the final agreement in Havana would be submitted to plebiscite, whether the FARC liked it or not. In late February, the FARC's 'armed proselytism' during a 'political pedagogy' event (attended by Iv√°n Marquez and other negotiators) in La Guajira stirred significant controversy. Since 2015, the FARC's negotiators had been authorized by the government to travel to Colombia to organize 'political pedagogy' events with their troops only, and till then all such activities had occurred without major problems. However, the presence of armed men mingling with the civilian population during this particular event in La Guajira rekindled fears about the use of weapons by the guerrilla during political events. President Santos notified the guerrilla that 'political pedagogy' events were suspended until further notice and issued an ultimatum that either a final agreement is signed on March 23 or it would be understood that the FARC are not ready for peace. Semana considered the incident as a major blow to confidence and trust in the peace process, which came at a critical moment. Due to continued disagreements, the March 23 deadline for a final agreement announced six months prior passed without any such agreement being announced. It had been hoped that a final agreement could coincide with President Barack Obama's historic visit to Cuba on March 20. Nevertheless, Secretary of State John Kerry met with both peace delegations while in Cuba, reiterating the Obama administration's support for the peace process and the post-conflict. On May 12, an agreement to provide legal security to the final agreement was reached. Once signed, the final agreement would be considered as a special agreement under the terms of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and form part of the Constitution of Colombia's constitutionality bloc (as international humanitarian law). The government would present before Congress an ordinary law to approve the final agreement as a special agreement, Congress would approve or reject it as a whole within 8 days and the Constitutional Court would review it. Afterwards, the government would present a constitutional amendment (legislative act) to incorporate the text of the final agreement to the Constitution as a transitory article. Finally, after signature of the final agreement, the President would make a unilateral declaration in the name of the Colombian State before the Secretary General of the UN, relating the final agreement to Resolution 2261 of January 25, 2016. The announcement ensured legal security to the agreement, increasing the FARC's confidence that the agreements would be followed - constitutional entrenchment of a final agreement would protect it from future changes in political conditions, and commit the Colombian government before the international community. By agreeing to this procedure, the FARC signalled their acceptance of the political institutions which it had rejected and fought against for decades. At the same time, without yet endorsing the plebiscite itself, the FARC indicated that the final agreement would be submitted for popular ratification, and thereby implicitly dropped their insistence on a constituent assembly as an implementation mechanism. The details of the agreement on legal security sparked legal controversy in Colombia. √Ålvaro Uribe called it a coup d'√©tat, while Inspector General Alejandro Ord√≥√±ez, another major critic of the peace process, wrote a letter to Santos in which he accused him of wishing to replacing the Constitution in tandem with the FARC and threatened him with disciplinary action. However, lawyers not necessarily opposed to the peace process also raised questions about the legality of the measures detailed in the May 12 agreement, such as the incorporation of the final agreement into constitutional jurisprudence. Three days later, the negotiating parties announced an agreement on the release of minors under 15 years of age from FARC camps as well as a road map for the release of all other minors and a special program for their care. On June 10, the creation of an illicit crop substitution pilot project in Brice√±o (where the mine clearance pilot project was organized) was announced from Cuba. On June 23, the government and the FARC signed historic agreements on the 'end of the conflict' including the bilateral ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and surrender of weapons during a ceremony in Havana, Cuba. The signature of the agreements was overseen by the guarantor countries (Cuba and Norway) and attended by President Juan Manuel Santos; FARC commander 'Timochenko'; UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon; Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro, the host; Michelle Bachelet, President of Chile (accompanying country); Nicol√°s Maduro, President of Venezuela (accompanying country); Norwegian foreign minister B√∏rge Brende; Danilo Medina, President of the Dominican Republic (president pro tempore of CELAC); Salvador S√°nchez Cer√©n, President of El Salvador; Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, President of Mexico; and representatives of the European Union and the United States. The June 23 agreement laid down the modalities for the bilateral and definite ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, which would begin following the signature of the final agreement. Five days following the signature of the final agreement and following the redeployment of troops, the FARC would begin moving to 23 transitory rural settlement normalization zones (Zonas Veredales Transitorias de Normalizaci√≥n) and 8 encampments for the purposes of delivering their weapons to the UN mission and prepare for their reincorporation into civilian life. While the normal functioning of unarmed elected civilian authorities within these zones would not be impeded, no civilian population would be allowed to reside in the zones and access would be restricted. A 1 kilometre wide security zone, off limits to both soldiers and guerrilla, would surround each zone. The FARC would designate a group of 60 members to travel throughout the national territory in performance of tasks related to the peace agreement; likewise, within each zone, a group of 10 members of the guerrilla would travel within the municipality and department for the same reasons. The UN would collect and store all weapons received from the FARC, which would later be used to build three monuments. The guerrilla would surrender their weapons gradually in three phases over 180 days from the signature of the final agreement, and the UN mission would certify the process. The announcement offered further details about the tripartite monitoring and verification mechanism, with the international component (the UN political mission) presiding the mechanism, resolving controversies and presenting recommendations and reports about the ceasefire and surrender of weapons. In addition to the above, the negotiating parties also announced an agreement on security guarantees, aimed at ensuring the safety of social movements, communities, human rights groups, political parties and movements (especially the political movement to be created by the FARC in their reintegration to civilian life). Symbolically, this agreement includes a 'national political pact' with political parties, unions and civil society to guarantee that never again will weapons be used in pursuit of politics goals, or violent organizations promoted. Unexpectedly, on June 23, it was also announced that the FARC had agreed to support the decision to be rendered by the Constitutional Court on the plebiscite - in short, the FARC explicitly agreed to the plebiscite as the ratification mechanism for the final agreement. Prior to the June 23 announcements, Constitutional Court judge Luis Ernesto Vargas had already submitted a positive report (ponencia) on the plebiscite. On July 19, the Constitutional Court ruled the plebiscite ratifying the final agreement to be constitutional. A final agreement between the FARC and the government was announced from Havana on August 24, with the full text of the final agreement - at 297 pages - being published later that evening. =Ratification= The final agreement was submitted to popular ratification in a plebiscite on October 2, 2016. It failed with 50.2% voting against it and 49.8% voting in favor, on a 37.4% turnout. Notably, Colombians living in regions that were hardest hit by the conflict, including displaced Colombians abroad, voted in favor while inland and urban areas that were more insulated voted in larger numbers against it. Following the failure of the referendum, the Colombian government and the FARC, on November 24, signed a revised agreement. Colombia's congress approved the revised peace accord. It was then submitted to Congress for approval. On 29 November, the Senate approved the deal 75-0 and the House of Representatives approved it the next day by a vote of 130-0 despite former President Alvaro Uribe's supporters boycotting the session. Santos welcomed the resolution, while Sergio Jaramillo, the government's peace commissioner, said: \\"This last part of renegotiation was exhausting. It took us to the limit. But now we pass to something more difficult, which is to change the conditions on the ground and benefit our campesinos. And to assure there is safe transit for the FARC and to worry about the security of communities. [We seek] no more political deaths in Colombia.\\" Uribe's supporters accused the government of giving away too many rights, including FARC's ability to form a political party. The deal now means FARC members were go to designated transitional zones within five days and hand over its weapons to the United Nations representatives within the next six months. They would also be able to form a political party. The country's highest court ruled in favor of the government's ‚Äúfast-track‚Äù plan to quickly implement the agreement. The government can move laws needed to carry out the country's peace deal with the Marxist FARC rebels through Congress more quickly than usual. = Women's involvement = The Colombian peace negotiations in Havana have had higher than average women's participation - at times, one-third of delegates in Havana have been women, above global averages. The General Agreement that guided the process recognized that the negotiations \\"require the participation of all, without distinction.\\" When, one year into talks, women and their concerns remained largely absent from the table, women's organizations began to push for greater inclusion. In October 2013, nearly 450 women from across Colombia gathered in Bogota at the National Summit of Women and Peace to demand inclusion in the peace process. Two weeks after the National Summit, an agreement was reached in Havana on political participation, wherein both parties formally recognized the important role that women play in conflict-prevention, conflict-resolution, and peacebuilding. Subsequently, President Santos appointed two women with greater decision-making power on behalf of the Colombian Government at the talks. In August 2014, delegations of survivors of the conflict addressed negotiating parties, 60% of whom were women. This may be the first time that women negotiating on both sides of the table met with women affected by conflict. Representatives of women's organizations and the LGBTI community also addressed negotiators as gender experts. The equal participation in the construction, implementation, verification and countersignature of the agreements reached in the Dialogues of Havana are subject of concern of women's organizations that historically have worked for peace and human rights in the country. The Red de Mujeres (1995), the Ruta Pac√≠fica (1996), and the Iniciativa de Mujeres por la Paz (2002) are some platforms that have targeted, among other issues, to the bilateral cease of fire, demilitarization of civil life, equitable land distribution, respect for human body, justice and differential approaches. By the time when the peace process began with the FARC, Colombia's women already had a consolidated work in various peace agendas. Therefore, organizations around the country wrote open letters to the government demanding equal participation, supported by UN Women. Before finishing 2012, when began the negotiating of the principle of the end of armed confrontation with the oldest Latin American guerrillas, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams, sent a letter to Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, claiming a space for women in Havana. With the intention that there were not more agreements without the gender perspective, at the end of October 2013 took place in Bogot√° the National Summit of Women for Peace, where was a national agenda consolidated, where around 500 women from 30 of the 32 departments representations. With the motto ‚Äúlas mujeres no queremos ser pactadas, sino ser pactantes‚Äù (Women do not want to be agreed, but be Covenanters),\\" the 800 proposals that were built were given to the government delegation. In November, the summit published its declaration ‚ÄúPeace and democracy with women suit‚Äù where the experience of the Summit was collected. Proposals insisted on equal participation, demilitarization, bilateral cease, dismantling of paramilitary structures, truth, justice and reparation for all victims and \\"continue to build peace from the regions and from the everyday, strengthening the experiences of women as peacebuilders\\". In September 2014, a dedicated gender Subcommittee was established at the talks, mandated to ensure that a gender perspective and women's rights are included in all agreements. The gender Subcommittee of the peace talking is unique in the world. In mid-2014, when the discussion of the agreement for Victims was initiated, negotiators announced the creation of the Sub commission of gender with the mission of ensuring a gender approach in partial agreements that had been reached at the moment and in the future settlements.Additional parallel developments have been the empowerment of indigenous women, who have created the first National Commission of Indigenous Women. Women have also been able to create the first permanent dialogue space between civil society and the security sector. = The role of the international community = Secretary- General Ban Ki-Moon Addresses the Crowd at the Colombian peace ceremony in Cartagena where Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Timole√≥n Jim√©nez signed a peace accord on September 26, 2016 The Colombian peace process distinguishes itself from other conflicts because of the level of support and involvement of the international community. The role of international community in the peace process was that of a facilitator and guarantor for the peace talks. On January 25, 2016, the Security Council of the United Nations supported the ongoing peace talks in Havana by unanimously adopting resolution A/RES/2261 including the decision to accompany the end of the conflict in Colombia ‚Äì one of only 14 decisions the Security Council adopted unanimously in its history. After implicit invitation of the conflict parties in section 6.3 of the final agreement, the United Nations currently monitor the conflict parties' compliance with the final agreement in accordance with resolution A/RES/2435. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) served as independent intermediary during the peace talks and provided logistical support. Apart from transporting FARC negotiators to the peace talks in Havana, the ICRC was also involved in several hostage rescues and conducted rescue operations of FARC fighters and Colombian military personnel. The peace process and the Havana peace talks were supported by the governments of Norway and Cuba that are both guarantors of the final agreement. The involvement of Norway and Cuba contributed to the mutual trust of the conflict parties and to the credibility of the peace process. While the involvement of third parties in the drafting of peace agreements does not alter the legal status of the peace agreement, it contributed to the successful conclusion of the negotiation: The lacking involvement of the international community in the peace negotiations during the presidency of Andr√©s Pastrana is said to have contributed to the failure of the negotiations. Norway also contributed to the peace process by sending an investigation team to determine and establish the zones contaminated by anti- personnel mines and other explosives of the civil war. Norway and Cuba both made the peace negotiations possible by providing a meeting venue: The peace talks were formally inaugurated in Oslo, Norway, on October 18, 2012, and then moved to their permanent location in Havana, Cuba. The governments of Chile and Venezuela served as observer state during the peace talks. The peace process also received the support of a number of other governments in Latin- America such as Venezuela's President Hugo Ch√°vez, Rafael Correa the President of Ecuador, and Bolivian President Evo Morales. The Security Council of the United Nations underlined the important role that third countries played during the Colombian peace process in resolution A/RES/2261. According to Juan Manuel Santos, the peace process would not have been successful without the support of the international community. Contents of the agreements =Comprehensive rural development (May 26, 2013)= Extremely unequal land ownership is both a cause and a consequence of the Colombian armed conflict. In 1960, 0.4% of landowners held 30% of all farmland. By 1997, the concentration of land ownership was further accentuated, with 0.35% of landowners holding 45% of all farmland with 86% owning just 13%. In 2012, 1% of landowners (those owning large properties over 200 hectares) held 43% of the land, and an additional 13% of landowners (those owning medium-sized properties over 20 hectares) held 39% of the land. 79% of landowners had properties of less than 10 hectares (considered microfundio and minifundio), which accounted for just 11% of private rural land. The 2014 Agricultural Census reported that 0.4% of agricultural production units (over 500 hectares) occupy 77.6% of the country's rural area, while 71% of agricultural production units (less than 5 hectares) occupy just 2% of rural land area. On the largest landholdings (over 1,000 hectares), an average of only 28% of the land is used for agricultural purposes with the remainder of the land covered by natural vegetation, confirming common accusations that the land is underutilized. The 2014 census also showed that, since 1960, the fragmentation of smallholdings had increased - production units of less than 5 hectares increased from 63% of 71% of the total number of such units - while the weight of large landholdings (over 500 hectares) in the total rural land area had increased significantly from 40% to 77.6%. The inequitable land distribution has increased since 2000, as measured by the Gini coefficient for land ownership - 0.885 in 2009, compared to 0.877 in 2000. Colombia is one of the countries with the highest inequality in rural property in Latin America and the world. Poverty in rural Colombia is significantly higher than in the cities. In 2014, Colombia's multidimensional poverty rate was about 21%, but in rural areas poverty was 45%. The expansion and escalation of the armed conflict since the 1980s has greatly contributed to the consolidation of inequality in land distribution, through the illegal dispossession of land, forced displacement and re- concentration of ownership. The scale of land dispossession is disputed, but is estimated that as high as 6.6 million hectares were illegally seized (by drug traffickers, paramilitaries, agribusiness, the government or the guerrilla) over the last two decades. Agrarian reform has been one of the FARC's main causes since the guerrilla's foundation in 1964. However, since then, the FARC's demands on agrarian reform have evolved significantly. In 1964, the nascent guerrilla called for the confiscation of Latifundia to deliver them for free to farmers. In 1982, at their seventh conference, the FARC issued a 'law' for agrarian reform abolishing land owned by foreign, oil, mining, banana or timber companies and latifundio properties over 1,500 hectares, to be turned over to the FARC for distribution to farmers. During the Cagu√°n peace process, the FARC demanded the recovery of unproductive land for agrarian reform. The FARC arrived in Havana with moderated views on the subject - their proposals included stimulation of agricultural use of land for food production to achieve food sovereignty, empowering rural communities and formalization of property titles. Comprehensive or integral rural reform and development was the first item on the general agreement between the government and the FARC, and a partial agreement was signed in May 2013. The agreement has four cornerstones: access to land and land use, the establishment of special development programs, poverty reduction and eradication of extreme poverty, and food security. The main measures laid out include: * A Land Fund would be created, to provide 'comprehensive access' to land for landless or land-poor peasants. The lands would be acquired through judicial expiration of ownership, recovery of illegally acquired land, expropriation for the social interest or public utility or unexploited lands. The land would be accompanied by a comprehensive subsidy, credits, technical assistance, housing, marketing and access to means of production provided by the government. Redistributed land would be inalienable and non-transferable for a period of seven years. * A 'massive' formalization of property titles for small and medium rural properties. It is estimated that a fifth of all rural properties, and nearly half of small ones, have title problems, a problem which prevents the existence of a real market for land and investments and which has facilitated land dispossession during the conflict. * The creation of an agricultural jurisdiction to ensure effective legal protection for rural inhabitants' property rights. * Update and modernization of the rural cadastre and rural property tax. Creation of a new high-level body formulating general guidelines for land use and implementing reconversion programs. The agreement would strengthen citizen participation in land use planning, with mechanisms for consultation with all levels of government and ethnic minorities. * The government would delimit the agricultural frontier and protect areas of special environmental interest. * The establishment of special development programs with a territorial approach (PDET) to achieve structural transformation of rural Colombia, in priority those regions which have been most affected by the conflict and poverty. The action plans would be developed in a participatory manner aimed at fostering regional transformation. * Implementation of national plans for comprehensive rural reform, aimed at reducing poverty by 50% and eradicating extreme poverty within a transitional phase of 10 years. These plans would include infrastructure (roads, irrigation, electricity, internet connectivity), social development (health, education, housing, drinking water), incentives for the productivity of family agriculture (technical assistance, cooperative economy, special lines of credit, subsidized crop insurance, marketing) and rural labour formalization. * A Food security system which would include food and nutritional councils at all territorial levels, programs against hunger and malnutrition, measures to strengthen local and regional markets and promotion of proper food handling practices for families. =Political participation (November 6, 2013)= The transformation from a guerrilla movement to a political party has been one of the FARC's main public aims since the beginning of negotiations. At the same time, their potential political participation is one of the most unpopular points of the peace process. The FARC considers Colombia to have a non- democratic political system marked by state terrorism, and has demanded a 'democratic opening' which includes not only institutional reforms but broader popular participation for social movements and greater direct democracy. The government considers the 1991 Constitution to have created a more democratic political system, with different possibilities for popular participation in politics. A partial agreement on political participation, the second point of the agenda, was announced on November 6, 2013. This agreement seeks to strengthen the participation of all Colombians in politics and public affairs and the expansion of democracy as a way to resolve conflicts peacefully and finally break the link between politics and armed confrontation. The three main points of this agreement are greater citizen participation, a democratic opening and breaking the link between politics and weapons. The main measures are: * Creation of a statute of the opposition following the signature of the final agreement, following discussions in a commission made of legally recognized political parties and movements. No legislation defining guarantees for opposition parties has ever been adopted, despite being required by article 112 of the 1991 Constitution. * Security guarantees for political activities, through the creation of a Comprehensive Security System. These security guarantees would be aimed at protecting those who participate in politics by respecting their human rights and dignity, preventing violence and instilling a culture of tolerance and coexistence to prevent stigmatization and persecution of political leaders. The security guarantees, including the structure of the Comprehensive Security System, were fleshed out on June 23, 2016. The Comprehensive Security System, led by a high-level body and a technical committee, would implement a protection program to protect members of the new party or movement founded by the FARC. For such purposes, a dedicated sub-unit of the National Protection Unit (which would include demobilized members of the FARC) and a security and protection body (with members of the FARC's political movement in liaison with the National Police), would be created. A National Commission of Security Guarantees, chaired by the President, would design and monitor public and criminal policies aimed at the dismantlement of any organization contravening the agreement. The security guarantees would also extend to social movements, human rights defenders, Security and protection guarantees are particularly important for the FARC, whose greatest fear is a repeat of the extermination of the Patriotic Union (UP) in the 1980s, when over one thousand members of the left-wing political party (founded in 1985 with the FARC's participation following the La Uribe ceasefire agreement in 1984) were assassinated by paramilitaries and agents of the state. * Creation of 16 Special Temporary Peace Constituencies for the election of representatives to the Chamber of Representatives for two terms (2018-2022, 2022-2026). These districts would be created in the regions most affected by the conflict, which are also the regions where the FARC are strongest. The inhabitants of these regions would be able to elect, during the transitional phase and on a temporary basis, additional members to the lower house with special rules. Candidates must be regular residents of the districts or displaced from them in the process of returning, and may be registered by social movements or community organizations. This is separate from the provision granting FARC 10 seats (5 in each house). In the revised agreement, FARC is prohibited from running in these zones. A member of the National Electoral Council is expected to table a constitutional amendment to create these constituencies. According to this bill, there would be thirteen single-member constituencies (in addition to regular seats) for three terms, or twelve years, with candidates elected representing social organizations and not political parties with congressional representation. The Peace and Reconciliation Foundation also proposed the creation of nine Ex officio seats for the FARC in the Senate. The proposal has generated significant public debate. * Facilitate the creation of new political parties and detach the attainment and conservation of parties' legal status from the requirement to surpass the threshold in congressional elections. During a transitional period of eight years, the state would give special support to the creation of new parties through funding and outreach programs. Adopt measures to promote equality of conditions during electoral campaigns. * Promotion of electoral participation through national registration, education, information and outreach campaigns. * Increase the transparency of the electoral process and transparency in the allocation of government advertising, by creating a national court for electoral guarantees, strengthening the investigation of electoral crimes and ensuring greater transparency in campaign financing. * Electoral reform, including reform of the electoral bodies, to be discussed by a special electoral mission. * Promotion of a democratic and participatory political culture based on respect for democratic values and principles, transparent management of public management (banning patronage and corruption) and integration of marginalized communities (women, LGBT, Afro-Colombians and indigenous peoples). * Creation of new media spaces for political parties and movements, with a new institutional television channel for parties to publicize their platforms, and to publicize the work of organizations and social movements. * A guarantees law for social organizations and movements which will, among other things, guarantee their access to information, right to reply and correction and participation in decision making. * Guarantees for social protests, including both protesters and other citizens. * Increased civic participation in institutional, regional and local media in order to inform about the activities of different civil society organizations. * Measures to promote a culture of tolerance, non-stigmatization and reconciliation, to be overseen by a National Council for Reconciliation and Coexistence. * Citizen oversight and control to ensure the transparency of public management and proper use of resources. * Promote the participation and influence of citizens in territorial planning and budgeting, with the creation of Territorial Planning Councils which would draw from various organizations and movements. In July 2016, the negotiating parties announced through a joint communiqu√© the composition of the commissions which would study the opposition statute, electoral reform and the guarantees law for social organizations and movements. The final agreement announced on August 24 establishes guarantees for the new political party or movement to be created by the demobilized FARC following the end of the decommissioning process. The representatives of the FARC would formally register their new political movement before the National Electoral Council, providing their act of creation, party statutes, code of ethics, ideological platform and appointment of its leadership. As a result of this formal registration, the new party would be recognized as a legally constituted and recognized party under Colombian law, and it would have to comply with all the legal requirements to remain a legally registered party except for membership requirements and, until 2026, the electoral threshold (3% of votes nationally) required for other parties to maintain their legal status. To facilitate the FARC's transformation into a political party, it would receive, until 2026, public financial assistance equivalent to 10% of the annual budget for political parties and, until 2022, an additional 5% of said budget. The presidential and senatorial candidates of the new party would receive public funding for the 2018 and 2022 elections. In addition, following the conclusion of the decommissioning process, the government would amend the constitution and laws as necessary to allow for the temporary, ex officio participation of the FARC's new party in the Congress for two terms beginning in July 2018. Although the party's lists, either alone or in coalition, would compete equally for seats in both houses, the new party would be guaranteed five seats in each house, including those won according to regular electoral rules. Until 2018, the FARC would be represented in each house of Congress by three speakers who would only be allowed to participate in the debates for the constitutional and legal reforms which would follow the adoption of the final agreement. The FARC's new party would also be entitled to transitory representation in the National Electoral Council. =Illicit drugs (May 16, 2014)= Drug cultivation, production and trafficking has been inextricably linked to the Colombian armed conflict for decades, having served as the main source of financing for most illegal armed groups (including the FARC) while playing a central role in the Colombian and foreign governments' responses to the internal conflict. Colombia continues to be the world's single largest producer of cocaine and coca leaves. The land area under coca cultivation has decreased from over 140,000 hectares in 2001 due to aerial coca eradication and manual eradication, but there has been an increase in coca cultivation since 2013, with 96,000 hectares under coca cultivation in 2015 according to the latest United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report, representing a 39% increase on the previous year. The majority (81%) of coca cultivation is concentrated in three southern departments (Nari√±o, Cauca, Putumayo, Caquet√°) and in Norte de Santander Department, which are also regions with a substantial FARC presence. The UNODC suggests that different negotiations on the issue, in Havana and other settings, are generating incentives for increased coca cultivation because of the perception that the benefits of development projects would mainly be directed at coca cultivators. The FARC are involved in all stages of production, from coca cultivation to wholesale drug trade. In the 1990s, the FARC successfully co-opted some cocalero (coca cultivators) movements, and was originally primarily involved in the production stage while paramilitary groups dominated the more lucrative drug trafficking. However, by the second half of the 1990s, the dismantling of the Medell√≠n and Cali cartels and the dissolution of the Soviet Union triggered the entrance of the FARC into the drug trafficking business. A recent investigation by the Colombian attorney general's office concluded that FARC units are involved both directly and indirectly in the cultivation, processing and distribution - directly as owners of crops, laboratories, crystallization workshops as well as the distribution corridors contacting clients including national and international drug cartels; indirectly by providing security to crops or labs, organizing peasants in anti-eradication marches, setting product prices, charging taxes on the product or by providing security to third-party drug traffickers in return for a fee. The study also estimated at over US$22,900,000 (66,277,978,247 pesos) the guerrilla's revenues from narcotics and related taxes between 1995 and 2014. The FARC adamantly reject that they are drug traffickers, but have admitted to financing their activities through taxes levied at different stages of the drug production process (on producers, buyers, laboratory production and landing strips). The Colombian and American governments have considered the FARC to be one of the world's leading drug trafficking organizations. Although \\"Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States\\" according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary, \\"the FARC-EP are increasingly working with Mexican TCOs to smuggle ton quantities of cocaine into the United States.\\" The report indicates ties between the FARC and Mexican drug cartels including Los Zetas, Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel. In Havana, the FARC claimed that \\"the traditional drug policy of the Colombian state has been focused on the persecution of the weakest elements of the drug-trafficking chain: cultivators and consumers.\\" In 1999, in response to the large increase in domestic cocaine production activities and the deterioration of security conditions, the Colombian and US governments announced Plan Colombia, a joint anti-drug strategy. The main aims of the Plan were a 50% reduction in the production and trafficking of illegal drugs within six years and an improvement of security conditions in Colombia. US funding for the military component of Plan Colombia was on average US$540 million per year between 2000 and 2008, while the Colombian government invested approximately US$812 million per year. Following the September 11 attacks, Plan Colombia resources began to be used for anti- guerrilla operations. Over 80% of US aid to Colombia between 2000 and 2007 was military assistance, which came to reinforce the modernization of the Colombian armed forces under the Pastrana and Uribe administrations. Since the start of Plan Colombia, the main strategy for reducing cocaine production has been the aerial spraying of coca plantations with herbicides such as glyphosate. Since 2000 more than 1,600,000 hectares of coca crops have been sprayed and more than 413,000 have been manually eradicated. Aerial spraying of illicit crops is both very expensive and ineffective - for each hectare sprayed with glyphosate, coca crops are reduced by about 0.02 to 0.065 hectares, so 32 hectares of coca need to be sprayed to eradicate just one hectare (an effectiveness rate of just 4.2%). The marginal cost of removing one kilogram of cocaine from the market through spraying is roughly $240,000. Aerial spraying has a negative impact on the environment (deforestation, water pollution, harm to ecosystems), health (skin problems, respiratory illnesses, miscarriages) and causes internal displacement. After 2006, Colombian anti- drug policies shifted towards interdiction strategies (cocaine seizures, lab destruction, dismantling cartels) which have been far more effective than eradication strategies. These policies caused a major supply shock (increasing the street price of cocaine in the US), greatly reduced the net cocaine supply and led to major changes in the drug trafficking operations (shifting towards Central America and Mexico). Juan Manuel Santos, who had been responsible for the post-2006 drug strategy as defence minister, continued these policies as president. The Colombian government now addresses drug consumption from a public health angle and advocates for alternative development strategies in vulnerable regions affected by coca cultivation, while adopting a \\"rational and efficient\\" strategy against criminal activities tied to drug trafficking. As part of this new policy, in October 2015 the government ordered the suspension of aerial aspersion with glyphosate. The partial agreement between the FARC and the government on illicit drugs, announced in May 2014, reflects this paradigmatic shift away from the traditional militaristic approach and towards the voluntary substitution of illicit crops and social transformations in affected territories. The main measures announced are: * Substitution of illicit crops, through a joint process of participatory planning with the affected communities to ensure their active and effective participation in the decision-making process and in the joint construction of solutions. The program would be a component of comprehensive rural development, within a framework of territorial integration and social inclusion with a differential approach taking into account the realities of different regions. The objectives would be promotion of the voluntary substitution of crops, poverty reduction, productive opportunities for the cultivators, sustainable development, strengthened communities and strengthening the presence of the State. In cases where no agreement with the community is reached, the State would proceed with the eradication of illicit crops, prioritizing manual eradication wherever possible. * Participatory planning processes to find solutions to illicit crops and poverty, in order to establish a new alliance between the communities and the three levels of government to solve communities' problems. * Immediate assistance plans for illicit crops growers would be put in place. These would include immediate food assistance, projects of quick income generation, options of seasonal employment for migrant collectors, education, early childhood assistance, generation of employment options, infrastructure projects, * An evidence-based public health and human rights policy approach to the problem of drug use, based on the view that drug use is a phenomenon of a multi-causal nature. State institutions, in coordination with communities and families, would establish a national attention system including rehabilitation and social insertion measures. * Comprehensive strategy to dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking organizations. * Strengthen the fight against money laundering in all economic sectors. * Establish strict controls on the production and trafficking of chemical inputs for drug production. * Promotion of an international conference within the framework of the United Nations to objectively evaluate the war on drugs and seek to build a new consensus around the adjustments deemed necessary, taking into account the discussions and new international developments on the matter. In announcing the partial agreement on illicit drugs, the FARC committed to \\"contribute in an effective manner, with utmost determination and in different forms and through practical actions towards the final solution to the problem of illicit drugs, and to end any relationship that, based on their rebellion, may have taken place with this phenomenon.\\" Furthermore, the joint communiqu√© stated the construction of lasting peace requires everybody's \\"willingness to contribute to the elucidation of the relationship between conflict and the growing, production and marketing of illicit drugs and money laundering that result from this phenomenon.\\" =Victims (December 15, 2015)= The fifth point on the general agreement for negotiations was victims, a vast and complex item which included important issues such as transitional justice, reparations, truth and victims' rights. The item was one of the most complicated for the two parties to find an agreement on. The FARC, which claimed that its insurgency was justified and that it was not militarily defeated, initially refused to submit to the laws and institutions of a political system which it opposed. On the other hand, the government had the obligation to design a transitional justice system which would be satisfactory to the FARC (who sought restorative justice) but also in keeping with Colombia's international treaty obligations, notably the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Complicating issues further, both the FARC and the government have historically refused to admit responsibility for crimes they have committed, with the guerrilla considering itself a victim of State oppression and the Colombian government considering itself to be the leader and defender of a democratic society. In June 2014, the two delegations in Havana announced a set of ten principles which would guide their discussions on the victims issue. These principles were: recognition of victims, recognition of responsibility, satisfaction of victims' rights, victims' participation, elucidation of the truth, reparations for victims, guarantees of protection and security, guarantees of non- repetition, reconciliation and a rights-based approach. The various components of the full agreement on victims were gradually announced to the general public throughout 2015, with the cornerstone agreement on the \\"special jurisdiction for peace\\" being announced on September 23, 2015. On December 15, 2015, a full partial agreement on victims was announced. Taken as a whole, the agreement creates a Comprehensive System of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition (Sistema Integral de Verdad, Justicia, Reparaci√≥n y no Repetici√≥n). The system would seek to satisfy the rights of all victims of the armed conflict, including victims of the guerrillas, the State and paramilitarism. Access to judicial benefits under the Comprehensive System would be conditioned to contributing to the elucidation of the truth and reparations. The Comprehensive System is made up of five components: Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non-repetition; Special unit for the search of missing persons in the context of and due to the armed conflict; Special Jurisdiction for Peace; Comprehensive reparation measures for peace-building and guarantees of non-repetition. Truth commission A truth commission entitled the \\"Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non-repetition\\" (Comisi√≥n para el esclarecimiento de la verdad, la convivencia y la no repetici√≥n) would be created following the signature of the final agreement. Its aim is to contribute to the construction and preservation of historical memory, reach an understanding of the conflict's multiple dimensions, satisfy victims' rights and promote coexistence. The Commission would be centered on victims (their dignification and satisfaction of their right to the truth) and its work impartial, independent, transitory and extrajudicial. It would require broad participation, working at a national level but with a territorial approach (with the aim of achieving a better understanding of the regional dynamics of the conflict) and differential and gender-based approach (it would consider the different experiences, impact and conditions of persons because of their sex, gender, age, ethnicity or disabilities). As an extrajudicial mechanism, the truth commission's activities would be non-judicial in nature and would not imply criminal responsibility for those testifying before it, nor can these testimonies be transferred to judicial authorities although the commission may request information from judges and investigative bodies as required for its work. The Commission would have as a mandate to clarify practices which constitute serious human rights, collective responsibilities for these practices, the social and human impact of the conflict on society and different groups, the impact of the conflict on politics and democracy, the historical context of the conflict with its multiple causes and the factors and conditions which contributed to the persistence of the conflict. To do so, the Commission would investigate all the aforementioned elements, hold public hearings, present a final report, diffuse its work, ensure the gender mainstreaming throughout its work and be periodically accountable. The government and the FARC have committed to contribute to the clarification of the truth and to recognize their respective responsibilities before the Commission. The Commission would be composed of 11 members, chosen by the selection mechanism for the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (see below). The Commission would work for three years, following a six months preparation period. Search unit for missing persons The Special Unit for the Search of Missing Persons in the context and due to the armed conflict (Unidad especial para la b√∫squeda de personas dadas por desaparecidas en el contexto y en raz√≥n del conflicto armado) would be a special high-level unit created following the signature of the final agreement. It would direct and coordinate efforts to search for and locate missing persons, or find their remains so that they may be returned to their families. To carry out its work, the search unit would collect the necessary information about missing persons, analyze the information collected, strengthen and streamline processes for identifying mortal remains in coordination with the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, guarantee families' participation and present an official report to families informing them of the fate of missing relatives. The search unit would be administrative and financially independent and autonomous, complementing the other components of the Comprehensive System. Special Jurisdiction for Peace The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicci√≥n Especial para la Paz, JEP) would be the transitional justice component of the Comprehensive System, complying with Colombia's duty to investigate, clarify, prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law which occurred during the armed conflict. Its objectives would be to satisfy victims' right to justice, offer truth to the public, contribute to the reparation of victims, contribute to the fight against impunity, adopt decisions which give full legal security to direct and indirect participants in the conflict and contribute to the achievement of a stable and lasting peace. The JEP's guiding principles would be the centrality of victims; legal security (the JEP's decisions would be res judicata and immutable); conditionality; the right to peace; comprehensiveness as a component of the broader Comprehensive System; indivisibility (the JEP would apply to all who participated directly or indirectly in the conflict); prevalence over other criminal, disciplinary or administrative proceedings for acts committed in the armed conflict; guarantees of due process; differential focus taking into account the different consequences of crimes against women and against the most vulnerable groups; gender equality and concentration on the most serious and representative cases. Following the end of the armed conflict, the government would \\"grant the broadest possible amnesty\\" (as per section 5, article 6 of Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions) for rebels who have subscribed a final peace agreement with the State (crime of rebellion) and for those accused or condemned for political and related offences, as permitted by the Colombian Constitution. Amnesty or pardon does not absolve one from the obligation to contribute, individually or collectively, to the clarification of the truth. An amnesty law adopted by Congress would clearly determine those crimes eligible for amnesty or pardon and those which are not, as well as the definition of related offences. Political offences include rebellion, sedition, military uprising, illegal possession of weapons, death in combat compatible with international law, agreement to commit an offence for the purpose of rebellion and other related offences. Related offences would be defined by an inclusive and restrictive criteria; the first including offences specifically related to the development of the rebellion during the conflict, offences in which the passive subject is the State and any actions aimed at facilitating, supporting, financing or hiding the development of rebellion. In all circumstances, crimes against humanity, genocide, serious war crimes, hostage taking or other severe deprivations of physical liberty, torture, extrajudicial executions, forced disappearance, violent sexual intercourse and other kinds of sexual violence, child abduction, forced displacement and the recruitment of minors would not be eligible for amnesty or pardon. The Colombian Supreme Court has ruled that drug trafficking is a related offence to rebellion, as long as this activity was conducted to finance the insurgency. The inclusion of drug trafficking has generated significant controversy in Colombia. The government, pro-government legislators, the Ombudsman and the then-attorney general supported the inclusion of drug trafficking as a related offence, arguing that it was used to finance the rebellion. Senator √Ålvaro Uribe and inspector general Alejandro Ord√≥√±ez have strongly opposed its inclusion as a related offence, with Uribe stating that drug trafficking was tied to terrorism rather than political ends. The final agreement, in its annexes, includes the text of the amnesty law which would be presented to Congress. There would be three types of offences: ones directly eligible for amnesty (those most closely related to membership in the guerrilla), ones which would never be eligible for amnesty and others which would be defined the amnesty chamber of the JEP (including drug trafficking and kidnapping). Crimes which are not eligible for amnesty or pardon would be submitted to the JEP, which would have jurisdiction over all who participated directly or indirectly in the armed conflict: combatants of illegal armed groups who have subscribed a final peace agreement with the State, agents of the State who committed crimes in the conflict and third parties who directly or indirectly participated in the conflict without being members of an armed groups. The JEP would have jurisdiction over non-coercive financing of or collaboration with paramilitary groups for persons who had a 'determinant participation in the most serious and representative crimes'. However, members of paramilitary groups who demobilized and appeared before an ordinary court or the justice and peace tribunals would not be the competence of the JEP, although the government would commit to adopt measures to strengthen the clarification of the paramilitary phenomenon. Colombian Presidents, who benefit from a special constitutional status (article 174), would not be subject to the JEP. In the JEP, there would be \\"a special, simultaneous, balanced and equitable treatment\\" for agents of the State, founded on international humanitarian law and the military's operational rules. It was agreed in the final agreement that the legal sentences of all FARC combatants convicted of offences within the JEP's jurisdiction would be suspended until the JEP has been formed and has handled the individual's respective case. Two procedures would be applied, the first procedure in the case of acknowledgment of truth and acknowledgment of responsibility and the second procedure in the absence of acknowledgment of truth and responsibility. Responsibility would be publicly acknowledged collectively or individually in the year following the creation of the JEP; in the case of a collective acknowledgement of responsibility, individuals named may express their disagreement, in which case they would be subject to the second procedure. The Special Jurisdiction for Peace would be composed of the following five bodies and an executive secretariat: # Chamber of Acknowledgment of Truth, Responsibility and establishment of facts and conducts (Sala de Reconocimiento de Verdad y Responsabilidad y de Determinaci√≥n de los Hechos y Conductas): The chamber would be the organizer of all the cases received by the jurisdiction, filtering cases to concentrate on the most serious and representative crimes not eligible for amnesty. It would receive reports from the Attorney General, Inspector General, Comptroller General, the military criminal justice system, victims' organizations, human rights organizations as well as any relevant legal investigations and judgments. Having determined whether the cases received fall under the JEP's jurisdiction, it would group the reports by alleged/convicted perpetrator and similar conducts and present reports on practices or events, identifying all responsible and their shares of responsibility. On the basis of these reports, those individuals identified would acknowledge or deny their responsibility, individually or collectively. The Chamber would present a resolution of conclusions to the Peace Tribunal, with emphasis on the most serious and representative crimes, individualization of responsibilities, acknowledgements of responsibility and the identification of the appropriate sanctions. In cases without acknowledgement of responsibility, the Chamber would transmit the cases to the Investigation and Prosecution Unit for it to begin proceedings as appropriate. The Chamber would have considerable autonomy to manage its own affairs, set its rules, form working commissions, establish priorities, adopt criteria for selection and decongestion or define the sequence in which cases would be addressed. # Amnesty and Pardon Chamber (Sala de Amnist√≠a e Indulto): On the basis of the amnesty law the chamber would grant amnesty to persons sentenced or investigated for offences eligible for amnesty or pardon, and decide on the admissibility of amnesties recommended by the Chamber of Acknowledgment. In the event that the request or recommendation for pardon or amnesty is ineligible, the amnesty chamber would remit the case to the Chamber of Acknowledgment. # Chamber for the Definition of legal situations (Sala de Definici√≥n de Situaciones Jur√≠dicas): The definition chamber would be responsible for defining the legal situation of those who are ineligible for amnesty but not included in the Chamber of Acknowledgment's resolution of conclusions. In defining these persons' legal situations, it would have the power to decide whether to continue legal proceedings. It would also have the responsibility of determining possible procedural mechanisms to select and prioritize the cases of those who have not acknowledged responsibility. # Investigation and Prosecution Unit (Unidad de Investigaci√≥n y Acusaci√≥n): The investigation and indictment unit would handle the cases in which responsibility has not been acknowledged. It would investigate and, when necessary, lay charges before the Peace Tribunal or refer the cases to the defining chamber or amnesty chamber. In the course of its investigations, it may decide on protective measures for victims and witnesses. The unit would include a forensics research team and a special investigation unit for cases of sexual violence. # Peace Tribunal (Tribunal para la Paz), itself further subdivided into five sections: first instance in cases of acknowledgment of responsibility, first instance in cases of absence of acknowledgment of responsibility, appeals section, revision section and stability and effectiveness section. ## First instance in cases of acknowledgment of responsibility: In cases where responsibility is acknowledged, this section of the tribunal would evaluate the correspondence between the acknowledged acts (and those responsible for them) with the sanctions proposed by the Chamber of Acknowledgment's resolution of conclusions. It would then impose the appropriate sanctions, establish the conditions and modalities for implementing them and supervise compliance with the sentence in cooperation with the monitoring and verification bodies and mechanisms. ## First instance in cases of absence of acknowledgment of responsibility: The section would take cognizance of the charges laid by the Investigation and Prosecution Unit, proceed with an adversarial trial for those cases where responsibility has not been acknowledged and, when appropriate, render judgment and imposing alternative or ordinary sanctions when necessary. ## Revision section: The revision section would revise the cases of those already convicted by the ordinary courts and decide on the appropriate sanctions. It would also revise, at the request of the convicted person, the judgments of the ordinary courts dealing with conducts which occurred during the armed conflict when absence of fact or manifest error in the legal judgment is alleged. In addition, the revision section would resolve jurisdictional conflicts between the organs of the JEP and decide on requests for a person's attendance before the JEP. ## Appeals section: The appeals section would hear appeals against the judgments of the chambers and sections of the JEP, and victims' appeals against the sections' judgments for infringement of fundamental rights. The rulings rendered by the JEP would be res judicata and immutable. ## Stability and effectiveness section: After the Peace Tribunal has fulfilled its duties, this section would be established to ensure the stability and effectiveness of the resolutions and sanctions adopted by the JEP and resolve the cases which emerge following the end of the Tribunal's duties for acts committed before the signature of the final agreement and falling under the JEP's jurisdiction. The Peace Tribunal would be made up of a total of 20 Colombian and four foreign magistrates, who would be highly qualified experts in various areas of law particularly international humanitarian law, human rights law and conflict resolution. Colombian members of the tribunal would need to meet the same requirements as members of the country's three highest courts; namely to be native-born citizens, lawyers, never convicted of any crime besides political offences and a professional or academic career of fifteen years in the field of law. The three chambers would have a total of 18 Colombian and 6 foreign magistrates. The investigation and prosecution unit would be made up of at least 16 highly qualified legal professionals, 12 of which would be Colombian nationals. The selection mechanism was announced on August 12, 2016. It is to be made up of representatives appointed by Pope Francis, the Secretary General of the United Nations, the criminal chamber of Colombia's Supreme Court of Justice, the delegation of the International Center for Transitional Justice in Colombia and the Permanent Commission of the State University System. Members of the selection committee would elect magistrates with a four-fifths majority using a voting system promoting consensus. In addition to the magistrates of the chambers and tribunal, it would also select a list of 12 Colombian and 4 foreign alternates for the tribunal and chambers, the president of the JEP and the president of the Investigation and Prosecution Unit. =Sanctions and punishments= The agreement guarantees that extradition would not be granted for offences and crimes subject to the jurisdiction of the JEP and committed during the armed conflict prior to the signature of the final agreement. In addition, the imposition of any punishment by the JEP would not limit any right to political participation. The goal of the punishments imposed would be the satisfaction of victims' rights and the consolidation of peace, and would always be related to the level of acknowledgment of truth and responsibility in collective or individual declarations to the JEP, the gravity of the punished act, the level of participation and responsibility and the accused's commitment to truth and reparation of the victims. The punishment in cases where there has been acknowledgment of responsibility before the Chamber of Acknowledgment would be lesser than in cases of late or no acknowledgment. There would be three types of sanctions or punishments: ordinary sanctions of the JEP, alternative sanctions and ordinary sanctions, depending the level and time of acknowledgment of truth and responsibility. Ordinary sanctions of the JEP would be imposed to those who acknowledge responsibility in serious offences before the Chamber of Acknowledgment and would have a minimum duration of five years and maximum duration of eight years. The sanctions would have a restorative and reparative aim and involve 'effective restrictions of freedom and rights', including restrictions to the freedom of residence and movement which would be monitored and supervised to ensure compliance with the tribunal's orders. These sanctions would in no case involve imprisonment. For those who have did not have a 'decisive participation' in the commission of the serious acts, the punishment would be between two and five years. The restorative sanctions would be involve participation in projects, carried out in rural and urban areas, including: construction of infrastructure, environmental conservation, effective reparation for displaced peasants, substitution of illicit crops, rural and urban development, rural electrification, mine clearance and so forth. Alternative sanctions would be imposed to those who acknowledge responsibility later, before the first instance of the tribunal. They would serve an essentially retributive function and involve a deprivation of freedom - including prison - of five to eight years (two to five years for those who did not have a 'decisive participation'). Ordinary sentences would be imposed to those found guilty by the tribunal when there has been no acknowledgment of responsibility, and would be served according to provisions of regular criminal law for prison terms no lesser than 15 years and no greater than 20 years. The places where the sentences would be served would be subject to monitoring of a national and international verification body of the Comprehensive System, as well as security and protection measures Reparations Seven measures for comprehensive reparations are laid out in the agreement on victims, with the aim of contributing to the construction of peace and the recognition of victims and the damages of war. Victims are to be at the heart of all reparation measures. # Timely measures for the acknowledgment of collective responsibilities: All responsible parties undertake to participate in formal, public and solemn acts at the national and territorial levels recognizing their collective responsibility for damages caused, to ask for forgiveness and manifest their commitment to contribute to concrete measures of reparation. # Concrete measures to contribute to reparation: All those who have caused harm in the context of the conflict would be able to participate in concrete restorative actions, which would be taken into account to receive special legal benefits under the JEP. For the FARC, these measures would include reconstruction of infrastructure, mine clearance and decontamination, participation in illicit crop substitution programs, participation in the search for missing persons and environmental conservation projects (e.g., reforestation). The government would promote the participation in such projects of agents of the State and others who participated (directly or indirectly) in the conflict. # Collective reparations at the end of the conflict: Collective reparation processes would include the special development programs with a territorial approach (PDET) in regions most affected by the conflict, territorial collective reparation plans in regions where a PDET would not be implemented, and national collective reparation plans for groups and organizations (women's groups, economic associations, political parties and movements). # Psycho-social rehabilitation: Measures for individual emotional recovery and psycho-social rehabilitation plans for coexistence and non-repetition (community rehabilitation strategies for the reconstruction of the social fabric). # Collective right to return processes for displaced persons and reparations for victims abroad: For the right of return to displaced persons, the processes would be new collective programs to return and relocate victims of internal displacement, in coordination with other measures. For victims living outside of the national territory (refugees and exiles), the government would implement programs to assist and accompany their return to Colombia. # Land restitution measures: Existing land restitution processes would be strengthened to guarantee their coordination with collective reparation processes, territorial development programs and others plans and programs resulting from the final agreement. # Implementation and participative strengthening of victims' reparations policies: Existing forums for victims' participation would be expanded and strengthened to include victims and their organizations not currently part of these forums and ensure their participation therein. The final agreement does not resolve questions about material reparations by the FARC. Non-repetition The guarantees of non-repetition would be the result of the implementation of the different mechanisms and measures of the Comprehensive System, measures agreed upon under the 'end of the conflict' item and all other points of the final agreement (rural reform, political participation, illicit drugs). These guarantees are part of a broader, overarching shared commitment to respect human rights, promote the rights of all Colombians, coexistence, tolerance and free political participation. As part of guarantees of non-repetition, the government would implement measures to strengthen human rights promotion mechanisms and the protection mechanisms for human rights organizations and advocates. Specifically, this would include the promotion of a culture of human rights for peace and reconciliation, the strengthening of national information and monitoring systems for human rights, the implementation of human rights education, the strengthening of human rights organizations, the elaboration of a comprehensive protection protocol for human rights organizations, strengthened collaboration with the attorney general's office to follow up on complaints and investigations, the implementation of a national plan for human rights, the adoption of measures and legal modifications to protect social protests and mobilizations, and the creation of an advisory commission on human rights for the government and public institutions. =End of the conflict (June 23, 2016 and August 24, 2016)= The government and the FARC reached an agreement on three of the main points - bilateral and definite ceasefire, decommissioning of weapons and security guarantees - of the third item on the agenda, 'end of the conflict', on June 23, 2016. Bilateral and definite ceasefire The bilateral and definite ceasefire is the definite end of hostilities and offensive actions between the government and the FARC. Following the announcement of the final agreement on August 24, President Juan Manuel Santos declared that the bilateral and definite ceasefire would begin at midnight on Monday, August 29, 2016. Monitoring and Verification Mechanism A tripartite Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (MM&V;) would monitor and verify implementation of the agreement and compliance with the rules governing the ceasefire and decommissioning of weapons. The MM&V; would be integrated by representatives of the Colombian government, the FARC and an International Component made up of unarmed United Nations (UN) observers from Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) member states. The mechanism would have three instances or levels: one national, eight regional verifying structures and 'some' local monitoring structures. The International Component would preside over all levels of the mechanism, resolve disagreements (such as incidents and violations of the ceasefire or disarmament), present recommendations and present written reports. Transitory rural settlement normalization zones and encampments 23 Transitory rural settlement normalization zones (Zonas Veredales Transitorias de Normalizaci√≥n, ZVTN) and 8 encampents/transitory normalization points (Puntos Transitorios de Normalizaci√≥n, PTN) would be established throughout the country to manage the disarmament of the FARC and assist in their reincorporation in civilian life. The day following the formal signature of the final agreement, the armed forces would make the necessary logistical adjustments to facilitate the FARC's units displacement to these zones. The FARC would begin moving to these zones following mutually agreed routes of deployment. The MM&V; would monitor and verify the safe movement of the FARC's units to the zones. The ZVTN would be located in mutually agreed veredas, or rural settlements, within municipalities and be accessible by land or water. They would be of 'reasonable size' to allow monitoring and verification by the MM&V; and compliance with the stated objectives of the ZVTN. Once all of its men have moved to their ZVTN, the FARC would provide the government with a list of its members present in each ZVTN and the government would suspend arrest warrants for all FARC members located in the zones. While in these zones, the FARC, in coordination with the government, would be allowed to perform any type of training or education for its members. FARC combatants and militiamen would be allowed to leave the zones only in civilian clothing and without weapons. The normal functioning of unarmed elected civilian authorities within these zones would not be impeded in any way, and representatives of these civilian local authorities would have the right to permanently enter these zones except for encampments where the FARC would be concentrated. There would be civilian population within the FARC's encampments in the zones, and civilians' legal right to bear arms would be suspended for the entire duration of the zones. For the duration of the agreement on the ceasefire and disarmament, the FARC would designate a group of 60 disarmed members to travel throughout the national territory in performance of tasks related to the peace agreement; likewise, within each zone, a group of 10 members of the guerrilla would travel within the municipality and department for the same reasons. The MM&V; would be charged with monitoring and verifying compliance with the mutually agreed rules governing the ZVTN. In the case that events or circumstances within the zone require the presence of the National Police or any other public authority, its entry would be coordinated by the MM&V.; A one kilometer wide demilitarized security zone would be created around each ZVTN, in which no military or FARC unit would be permitted entry with the exception of MM&V; teams accompanied by the police if necessary. The government and the FARC have jointly defined security protocols to guarantee the security and protection of persons (MM&V; observers, public servants, FARC and civilian population), the deployment routes, deployments in the zones and the manipulation, storage, transportation and control of weapons, ammunition and explosives. The 23 ZVTN and 8 PTN would be located in 30 municipalities in 15 departments, as follows: Fonseca (Guajira), La Paz (Cesar), Tib√∫ (Norte de Santander), Remedios (Antioquia), Ituango (Antioquia), Dabeiba (Antioquia), Vig√≠a del Fuerte (Antioquia), Riosucio (Choc√≥), Tierralta (C√≥rdoba), Planadas (Tolima), Villarrica (Tolima), Buenos Aires (Cauca), Caldono (Cauca), Corinto (Cauca), Policarpa (Nari√±o), Tumaco (Nari√±o), Puerto As√≠s (Putumayo), Cartagena del Chair√° (Caquet√°), La Monta√±ita (Caquet√°), San Vicente del Cagu√°n (Caqueta), Arauquita (Arauca), Tame (Arauca), Mesetas (Meta), Vista Hermosa (Meta), La Macarena (Meta), Mapirip√°n (Meta), Cumaribo (Vichada), San Jos√© del Guaviare (Guaviare), Calamar and El Retorno (Guaviare). Decommissioning The decommissioning of weapons is a \\"technical, traceable and verifiable procedure through which the UN receives all the weapons of the FARC to destine them to the construction of 3 monuments\\" The FARC's decommissioning would involve the following technical procedures: registration, identification, monitoring and verification of possession, collection, storage, disablement, removal and final disposition. In short, after the UN registers, identifies and verifies possession of weapons, it would collect all of the FARC's weapons, store them in specific containers, remove them from the zone and disposes of them by building three monuments. Five days after the formal signature of the final agreement, the FARC would provide the UN with the necessary information for the decommissioning. The FARC would contribute by different means, including the provision of information and the cleaning and decontamination of areas affected by landmines, improvised explosive devices, unexploded ordnances and explosive remnants of war. The decommissioning would take place gradually over 6 months (180 days) from the formal signature of the final agreement ('D-day'). From the fifth to thirtieth day following D-day, the FARC would move to the ZVTN transporting all their individual and secondary weapons, militia armament, grenades and ammunition. The formal decommissioning of weapons would begin once all members of the FARC have reached the zones. The collection and storage of weapons would take place in three phases: 30% of weapons by D+90, an additional 30% of weapons by D+120 and the remaining 40% by D+150. By D+180 at the latest, or six months from the signature of the final agreement, the UN would have completed the process of extraction of weapons and would certify compliance of this process and duly inform public opinion. The bilateral ceasefire and the functioning the zones would end on D+180. All stages of the decommissioning process would be verified by the MM&V.; Reincorporation of the FARC In addition to the measures to be adopted for the political reincorporation of the FARC (their transformation into a political party), the final agreement provides additional measures for the socioeconomic reincorporation. To promote a collective socioeconomic reincorporation, the FARC would create an organization called Econom√≠as Sociales del Com√∫n (ECOM√öN), in which membership would be voluntary. The government would assist ECOM√öN by funding its legal and technical advice and expediting its creation. In addition, the group of citizens who would promote the creation of the FARC's future political party or movement would create a non-profit centre of political thought and education which would advance social studies and research and create political education programs. The government would also assist its creation by setting aside an annual sum of public money until 2022. A National Reincorporation Council (Consejo Nacional de la Reincorporaci√≥n, CNR) would be created, made up of 2 members of the government and 2 members of the FARC, and with the objective of defining the activities, timeline and follow-up of the reincorporation process. For the purposes of managing the reincorporation process, the FARC would, following its settlement in the aforementioned zones, provide the government with a complete list of all its members which would be revised and certified by the government in good faith. Once the FARC have surrendered their weapon and expressed their commitment to comply with the agreement to reincorporate to civilian life, they would be accredited by the government. The government would identify the necessities of the socioeconomic reincorporation process through a socioeconomic census, identify possible productive programs and projects for demobilized members of the FARC and would create a one-time fund for the execution of such programs through ECOM√öN. In addition, for such purposes, each member of the FARC would have the right to a one-time economic support payment of 8 million pesos to undertake an individual or collective project. All members of the FARC, for 24 months following the end of the decommissioning process in the zones, would receive a monthly payment equivalent to 90% of the legal monthly minimum wage, as long as they lack another source of revenue. Afterwards, a monthly payment to be defined by law would be given to reincorporated members who have chosen to continue their studies. In addition to the above, at the end of the functioning of the zones, all members of the FARC would receive a one-time payment of 2 million pesos. The government would pay the social security contributions for those members lacking a source of revenue. Various social programs - including formal education, vocational training, recognition of knowledge, housing, culture, sports, recreation, environmental protection, psycho-social attention, family reunification - would be identified and developed as necessary to help the reincorporation of the FARC. Security guarantees On June 23, the government and the FARC also announced a set of security guarantees to protect the security of all inhabitants, and specific measures for the protection of communities, social movements, political movements and the FARC's future political movement. In addition, the agreement includes the implementation of measures to intensify the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of the fight against criminal organizations which threaten the peace. Some of the main objectives of these security guarantees are respect, protection and promotion of human rights; ensure the State's legitimate monopoly one the use of force throughout the territory and strengthening the administration of justice. The main security guarantees and measures are: * A national political pact from the regions and with all political parties and movements, unions, civil society and all other major participants in the civic life of Colombia rejecting the use of arms in politics or the promotion of violent organizations like paramilitarism. * A National Commission of Security Guarantees presided by the President would have the goal of designing and monitoring public and criminal policy on the dismantlement of all criminal organizations and persecution of other criminal conducts threatening the peace agreement. * A Special Investigation Unit within the Attorney General's office for the dismantlement of all criminal organizations and paramilitary successor organizations. It would investigation, prosecution and indictment of criminal organizations responsible for homicides, massacres, gender violence or attacks on social and political movements. * Furthering the item on political participation, a Comprehensive Security System for political participation led by a high-level body and a technical committee, would implement a protection program to protect members of the new party or movement founded by the FARC but also other parties, social movement, community organizations and human rights advocates. For such purposes, a dedicated sub-unit of the National Protection Unit (which would include demobilized members of the FARC) and a security and protection body (with members of the FARC's political movement in liaison with the National Police), would be created. * A Comprehensive Security and Protection Program for communities and organizations in the territories would adopt and define protection measures for organizations, groups and communities in the regions. * An elite corps of the National Police to dismantle criminal organizations. * Prevention and monitoring instrument of criminal organizations, a system of anticipation and prevention for rapid reaction. * Anti-corruption measures, including policies to curb the penetration of the criminal organizations and behaviours. * Security guarantees for judges, prosecutors and other public servants. * A national mechanism to supervise and inspect regional private security companies and services. Implementation and verification For the purposes of the implementation and verification of the final agreement (item 6 of the agenda), an Implementation, Monitoring, Verification and Dispute Resolution Commission of the Final Peace Agreement (Comisi√≥n de Implementaci√≥n, Seguimiento y Verificaci√≥n del Acuerdo Final de Paz y de Resoluci√≥n de Diferencias, CSVR) would be created following the formal signature of the final agreement. It would be made up of three representatives of the government and three representatives of the FARC or its successor political party and would last until January 2019, at which time its members would decide on its continuation until 2026. During the 180-day ceasefire and decommissioning process, the CSVR would be accompanied by one delegate from each of the two guarantor countries (Cuba and Norway) and one delegate from each of the two accompanying countries (Venezuela and Chile). The commission's objectives would be the resolution of differences, monitoring of the implementation of the final agreement, verification of compliance, monitoring of the legislative implementation of the agreement and reporting on the implementation. Mechanisms would allow for citizen participation in the process. The CSVR's various responsibilities would include: * Adoption, within four months of its creation, of a framework plan for the implementation of the agreements. The plan would include all the objectives, goals, priorities, indicators, policy recommendations and timeline for the implementation of the agreement. The plan would be valid for ten years, with a first implementation phase lasting until 2019, and it would be revised annually. * Resolution of all disputes or unforeseen situations, in the absence of other dispute resolution mechanisms elsewhere in the agreement. * Use as a space to manage any situations or differences arising after the signature of the final agreement, which does not involve the UN. * Monitor all components of the final agreement and verify its implementation, notwithstanding the role of the MM&V.; * Propose drafts of bills or resolutions necessary for the implementation of the agreement. * Organize thematic and territorial commissions. * Produce periodic reports on the implementation of the agreement * Receive information and reports from other bodies charged with the implementation of the agreement such as civic organizations, universities, research centres etc. Additional measures to implement the agreements include: * Legal revisions to ensure that departmental and municipal development plans include measures to guarantee implementation of the agreement. * Use of central government funds and royalties to finance the implementation of the agreement. * Promotion of the private sector's participation in the implementation of the agreement to ensure growth, stability and the viability of the programs in the agreement. * Stimulating the reception of international cooperation and aid funds. * Promotion of social organization's participation in the execution of the programs in the agreement. * Creation of an integrated information system, to guarantee transparency in the implementation of the agreement. This system would include interactive online maps, regular accountability mechanisms, citizen oversight, transparency observatories, IT tools for the general public, mechanisms for citizens' complaints and internal control mechanisms. As agreed on May 11, 2016, the final agreement would be considered as a special agreement under the terms of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and registered, following its signature, before the Swiss Federal Council in Bern. Afterwards, the President would make a unilateral declaration in the name of the Colombian State before the Secretary General of the UN, relating the final agreement to Resolution 2261 of January 25, 2016. The immediate priorities for the implementation of the agreement are: * An amnesty law and constitutional amendment for the JEP. * Law approving the final agreement. * Constitutional amendment incorporating the text of the final agreement to the Constitution. * Constitutional and legal norms for the search unit for missing persons. * Law for the special unit for the dismantlement of all criminal organizations. * Law for special legal treatment for offences related to cultivation of illicit crops when the cultivators are not members of an armed group. * Suspension of arrest warrants and extradition procedures against members of the FARC and accused collaborators. * Constitutional and legislative amendments for guarantees and political participation of the FARC's new party. Legislative Act 1 of 2016 amends the Constitution to create a special legislative procedure for the implementation of the agreement, for a six-month period renewable once. According to the special process: * Bills and proposed constitutional amendments for the implementation of the agreement may only be initiated by the government. * Bills and proposed constitutional amendments under the special legislative procedure would have priority over all other bills. * The first debate on these bills would be held in a joint session of the permanent constitutional commissions of both houses. The second debate would be plenary debates on the floor of both houses. * Bills would be approved with the majorities required by law or the Constitution. * The legislative process would consist of only four debates, within eight days in both houses. * Bills may only be modified with the government's approval to conform to the final agreement. * Votes in commissions and plenaries would be on the entirety of the bills. * Bills and proposed constitutional amendments would be subject to automatic judicial review, following their promulgation. Judicial review of constitutional amendments may only be for procedural defects. In addition, the amendment gives the President special powers to issue legally binding decrees for the implementation of the agreement during a six-month period. These decrees are also subject to automatic judicial review. However, Legislative Act 1 of 2016 would only become valid following popular ratification of the final agreement in the plebiscite on October 2, 2016. The CSVR would include a verification mechanism, with an international component. The verification mechanism would include two respected figures of international renown to be selected by the government and the FARC, and the international component would include a representative from each one of the guarantor and accompanying countries. It would also include a technical component, with the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at Notre Dame University designing the methodology to identify advances in the implementation. The verification mechanism would objectively verify the state of the implementation of the agreement, identify delays or deficiencies, provide continuous support and contribute to strengthening the agreement's implementation. The government and the FARC would request from the United Nations the creation of a new political mission, following the end of the UN's mission as part of the MM&V.; The second political mission would verify the FARC's reincorporation to civic life and the implementation of the security and protection measures. The UN's mission could last up to three years. The international support for the implementation of the agreement would be meant to strengthen guarantees for the implementation of the agreement and would bring experiences, resources, monitoring and best practices to contribute to the implementation of the agreement. Some of the international organizations sought include the European Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization, Via Campesina, Unasur, Switzerland, the Dutch Institute for Multi-party democracy, UNESCO, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United States of America, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Red Cross, the International Center for Transitional Justice, Sweden and UN Women. At least 500 social leaders have been killed between the signing of the agreement and April 2019. The former leader of the FARC, Rodrigo Londo√±o, claimed in an open letter to Colombian President Iv√°n Duque in June 2019 that about 160 ex-fighters and their family members have been killed since the peace deal was signed.

A series of nine numbered items are edited together to sound more or less like one piece; these different selections offer varying sides of the contrapuntal equation. ...each piece is scored in order to provide the maximum opportunity within the melodic structure of a tune for ideas to flow freely as the trio members engage one another. A fine effort.\\". The Guardian's review by John Fordham said \\"Damaged In Transit is a no-frills, flat-out, brilliantly executed piece of stylistically-sweeping jazz jamming, with nothing else to listen to but some very long sax solos on very direct and outwardly simple tunes, underpinned by Swallow's elegant bass-playing and Adam Nussbaum's rumbly, Elvin Jones-like drumming\\".

The blaze was made in 1844 by Ludwig Leichhardt. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Leichhardt Tree in Taroom, in the upper Dawson River district, is named for its association with the explorer Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichhardt, who is thought to have blazed this tree during his expedition north from the Darling Downs to Port Essington (Darwin) in the Northern Territory in 1844-1846. Leichhardt, born in Prussia in 1813, was a student of philosophy, languages and natural sciences. He journeyed to Sydney in 1841-1842 with the expressed intention of exploring the interior of Australia, and studied the geology and botany of the Sydney district before undertaking exploratory journeys between Newcastle and the Moreton Bay district in 1843-44. By mid-1844 Leichhardt was hoping to join a planned official New South Wales Government expedition from Sydney to Port Essington, but impatient with government delay and uncertain as to whether such an expensive expedition would be given official approved, Leichhardt mounted his own expedition, funded by squatter subscriptions. Leichhardt and 5 volunteers sailed from Sydney for Moreton Bay, where they were joined by 2 more men, and by another 2 on the Darling Downs. The party left Jimbour Station, on the edge of the settled district of the northern Darling Downs, on 1 October 1844. By early November they had reached Juandah (now Wandoan), where Leichhardt decided to reduce the party by two, these men returning to Jimbour. Continuing north, Leichhardt reached the Dawson River (named by Leichhardt in honour of a Hunter Valley settler), crossing it where the town of Taroom now stands. Of the Dawson Valley, John Gilbert, a naturalist in Leichhardt's party, wrote: > \\"One of the most beautifully picturesque and extensive scenes met our > anxious gaze. The immediate vicinity of the hills was like park scenery - > clear undulating hills, with here and there small clumps of brigalo [sic], > while the sides of many of the hills were dotted with single scrubs, as if > picked out by hand. Beyond this to the westward, and round as far as we > could see to the E.S.E was a carpet of evergreens for six or seven miles and > then the high ranges rose up and formed a beautiful background to the most > pleasing natural picture we have seen.\\" It is thought that Leichhardt camped on the southern side of the upper Dawson, where Pemberton Hodgson, tracing Leichhardt's track in mid-1845, found 3 large gum trees blazed with the letter \\"L\\". The coolibah surviving in Yaldwyn Street, Taroom - with the blaze LL.1844 once visible - may have been one of these trees. In 1916 one L and part of the year 1844 was still discernible, but bark had grown over part of the date and the second L. In the mid-1970s the blaze was just discernible although unreadable, but it is no longer visible. Leichhardt crossed the Dawson River and stayed at Palm Tree Creek for several days before continuing westwards to Robinson's Creek, then crossed the Ruined Castle Creek area and the Expedition Range to the northwest. In late June 1845, John Gilbert was killed in an attack on the camp by Aborigines, but the remainder of the party survived and reached Port Essington, near Darwin, on 17 December 1845, completing an overland journey of nearly . They returned to Sydney by ship in March 1846. Leichhardt's journey, and the explorations of Pemberton Hodgson in 1845, did much to open the way to further non-indigenous settlement in southeastern Queensland. Even before Leichhardt's journal of the expedition was published in 1847, word had spread of the rich pastures of the Dawson River district, encouraging squatters such the Archer brothers (1850) to explore the area more closely. By November 1845, Taroom Station had been taken up, and by the time the Leichhardt pastoral district of was proclaimed in 1854, most of the country had been taken up for pastoral purposes. The township of Taroom developed at the Dawson River crossing at the junction of several squatter tracks - one leading over the Great Dividing Range to Juandah, one through the Auburn Range to Gayndah, and one south to Roma, and developed slowly as a staging post between Roma and Rockhampton. A post office was established at Taroom in 1853, a courtroom gazetted there in 1857, and the town was officially surveyed in 1860. At least two other blazes have been marked on the Leichhardt Tree. In 1893 the Dawson River flooded, reaching to the base of the Leichhardt Tree in Taroom. This level was marked on the tree, but is no longer visible; also a surveyor's blaze had been marked on the tree by August 1916. In 1925 the Irrigation and Water Supply Department surveyed the area for a proposed dam site, at which point another blaze supposedly was inscribed on the tree - again no longer visible. By the mid-1970s, the tree had been heavily lopped and was suffering severe insect damage. In 1979 several cavities caused by previous lopping and breakage were plugged and sealed to prevent further rotting, and the tree has successfully regenerated. On 23 October 1988, a monument was erected by the local historical society and tourism association to celebrate the Bicentenary of Australia and Leichhardt's 175th birthday.  Description  Leichhardt Tree, circa 1914 The town of Taroom is located where the Leichhardt Highway crosses the Dawson River, and the Leichhardt Tree is located about up a steadily inclining slope from the bed of the Dawson River, on the west side of Yaldwyn Street reserve in Taroom, between Dawson and Kelman Streets. Yaldwyn Street forms part of the Leichhardt Highway, connecting Roma and Rockhampton, and is the main road in and out of Taroom. Although the tree's root system is largely covered by bitumen road, footpath paving and nearby commercial buildings, the tree appears to be in good condition. The tree is a mature coolibah (Eucalyptus microtheca), indigenous to the Dawson River district. It has a height of about , and a canopy spread of about . Its age is estimated to be at least 300 years. A sign placed in the branches of the tree reads LEICHHARDT TREE, but all blazes have been overgrown by the bark. A plaque attached to the tree is inscribed: > Leichhardt, the explorer, passed over this track and marked this Tree in > 1844. At the foot of the tree, facing east to the street, is a small concrete block with a metal plaque attached, on which is inscribed: THE LEICHHARDT TREE THE EXPLORER LUDWIG LEICHHART MARKED THIS TREE IN 1844 \\"LL.1844\\" DURING HIS OVERLAND JOURNEY FROM JIMBOUR QUEENSLAND TO PORT ESSINGTON NORTHERN TERRITORY THIS SETTING PROVIDED BY TAROOM LIONS CLUB  Heritage listing  Leichhardt Tree was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Leichhardt's exploration of the Dawson River area paved the way for rapid pastoral expansion in the Leichhardt district from the mid-1840s to the early 1850s. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Estimated to be around 300 years old, the Leichhardt Tree is a familiar landmark in the town of Taroom, making a significant contribution to the streetscape of the town, well-known to all residents and often photographed by travellers. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Estimated to be around 300 years old, the Leichhardt Tree is a familiar landmark in the town of Taroom, making a significant contribution to the streetscape of the town, well-known to all residents and often photographed by travellers. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Leichhardt Tree at Taroom is important for its association with Prussian explorer FW Ludwig Leichhardt, who played an important role in early non-indigenous exploration of the Australian interior, particularly with his epic journey from the Darling Downs to Port Essington, which contributed significantly to European knowledge of the Queensland landscape.

Biography  Born in Fukuoka Prefecture, Azuma moved to Tokyo in 1997 to pursue his dream of becoming a rock musician. Around this time he took a job as a trader in the Ota Market, one of Japan's largest flower and produce markets. He cites his job at the Ota Market as the inspiration for pursuing a career in flowers. With his interest in ornamental flowers piqued, he then took a job managing a flower shop in Azabu-J≈´ban in 1999. Azuma began his career as a flower artist in 2002 with the opening of the flower shop JARDINS des FLEURS. He partnered with photographer Shiinoki Shunsuketo to open the flower shop. Around 2005 Azuma began to explore a new form of floral design that he called botanical sculpture, the work for which he is now known.

The building is planned to be approximately 60 stories and tall. It will have 698 units. Although originally intended to be a mixed use building when planned in 2012 and approved in 2013, the building was reenvisioned as an apartment building in 2016. Construction began in 2017. Background Map depicting Wolf Point (area owned by the Kennedy family in black, with approximate area of the historical Wolf Point settlement in red)On January 26, 2012, the Chicago Sun-Times broke the story that the Kennedy family was planning a three-tower development at Wolf Point. On May 8, 2012, Chicago Alderman Brendan Reilly announced that a three-tower proposal for Wolf Point had been made including buildings of approximately , and and that plans would be made public on May 29. In a formalization of the proposal later that year the East Tower continued to be planned at . By October 2016 the height of the east tower had been revised down to , and the south tower revised to . The October 2016 revision was estimated to have 62 stories by on source and 66 by another. As of March 2017, some sources still felt the building might be 66 stories and encompass 707 apartment units, but when the building permit for construction was issued on June 22, 2017, it seemed that the plans were for a 60-story, 698-unit, building. By June 28, the $380 million construction project was backed by a $200 million loan led by Bank of America and construction had begun. Occupancy was expected in 2019. Location The site of Wolf Point South Tower in March 2014 The property upon which the development was planned is historic and drew scrutiny by critics. Plans for the tower development were presented as scheduled by the Kennedy family on land that they own in the River North neighborhood at the confluence of South, North, and Main Branches of the Chicago River southwest of the Merchandise Mart complex. As plans for the Kennedy proposal were developing on the north bank of Wolf Point, a plan for a 45- to 50-story office building on the west bank called River Point were progressing according to Robert Sharoff of The New York Times. Chicago Tribune Pulitzer Prize- winning architecture critic Blair Kamin felt that the initial plans presented by Christopher G. Kennedy needed some work. History West Tower under construction On October 30, 2012, a revised plan was presented that included more open space. In November the responses to the revisions were negative, and Reilly withdrew the proposal on November 27. The Chicago Plan Commission approved the plans for the entire three-tower development that included 1,410 residential units, 450 hotel rooms and 1,285 parking stalls on January 24, 2013. In May 2013, opponents of the planned development filed suit in United States Federal Court. On November 19, 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve ruled that the valuable and iconic views of downtown are not something that can be constitutionally protected saying \\"Illinois courts do not recognize property values, air, or light as constitutionally protected property interests.\\" The Wolf Point Towers broke ground in March 2014. Neighboring Wolf Point West Tower had its groundbreaking ceremony on July 18, 2014. The building opened for residence on January 13, 2016. After the 48-story, Wolf Point West Tower was successfully marketed as an apartment building, the East Tower was revamped as an apartment building in 2016. 2016 design changes resulted in a greatly reduced footprint and use of only of the entitlement. The building was designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli & Pappageorge Haymes Partners, developed by Hines Interests and the Kennedy family with backing from the real estate investment arm of the AFL-CIO's pension.

It is in the Hooker Valley, in the Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park in New Zealand's South Island, just south of Aoraki / Mount Cook. Etymology The geographic Hooker items were named by the Canterbury provincial geologist, Julius von Haast, after British botanist William Jackson Hooker. Description Hooker Lake's length has doubled between 1990 and 2013 from 1.2 kilometres to 2.3 kilometres, the glacier retreating by over per year. It is expected to grow by another as Hooker Glacier retreats further up the valley until the glacier's retreat will have reached the point where the glacier bed is higher than the lake's water level. The lake is one of the most accessible glacier lakes and can be reached year- round from the White Horse Hill camp ground near Mount Cook Village via the well-formed Hooker Valley Track. The track ends at a lookout point at the lake's shore, with a short path providing easy access to the shore. In the warmer months icebergs can typically be seen floating in the water. The icebergs slowly drift from the terminus of the glacier at the northern end of the lake until close to the shore. The lake's water temperature is typically lower than . Shore of the frozen lake in winter, with people walking onto the ice In winter, the lake freezes over, and at the coldest time of the year it can be safe to walk onto the ice. Hooker Lake drains into Hooker River, its glacial waters blueish light grey due to the suspended glacial rock flour. No boats tour the lake, but they do the large, nearby Tasman Lake.

The dynasty reached its zenith under its last ruler Harsha-Vardhana, whose empire covered much of north and north-western India, and extended till Kamarupa in the east and Narmada River in the south. The dynasty initially ruled from Sthanvishvara (modern Thanesar, Haryana), but Harsha eventually made Kanyakubja (modern Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh) his capital, from where he ruled until 647 CE.  Etymology and name  According to Harsha-charita, composed by the court poet Bana, the family was known as Pushyabhuti dynasty (IAST: Pu·π£yabh≈´ti-va·πÉ≈õa), or Pushpabhuti dynasty (IAST: Pu·π£pabh≈´ti-va·πÉ≈õa). The manuscripts of Harsha- charita use the variant \\"Pushpabhuti\\", but Georg B√ºhler proposed that this was a scribal error, and that the correct name was Pushyabhuti. Several modern scholars now use the form \\"Pushpabhuti\\", while others prefer the variant \\"Pushyabhuti\\". Pushya refers to the constellation of stars and Vibhuti means the sacred ash or blessing, thus Pushyabhuti literally means \\"the blessings of auspicious star constellation\\" enoting the \\"divine/heavenly blessings\\" or \\"the fulfillment of prophecy\\". Some modern books describe the dynasty as \\"Vardhana\\", because the names of its kings end with the suffix \\"-vardhana\\". However, this may be misleading as the names of kings of other dynasties also end with this suffix.  Origins  No concrete information is available about the origins of the dynasty. Harshacharita by the 7th century poet Bana gives a legendary account of their origin, naming Pushyabhuti as the dynasty's founder. According to this legend, Pushyabhuti lived in the Srikantha janapada (modern Kurukshetra district), whose capital was Sthanvishvara (modern Thanesar). A devotee of Shiva, Pushyabhuti became involved in a tantric ritual at a cremation ground, under the influence of Bhairavacharya, a teacher from \\"the South\\". At the end of this ritual, a goddess (identified with Lakshmi) anointed him the king and blessed him as the founder of a great dynasty. The Pushyabhuti mentioned in Bana's account appears to be a fictional character, as he is not mentioned in the dynasty's inscriptions or any other source.  History  The Pushyabhuti dynasty originally ruled a small area around their capital Sthaneshvara (Thanesar). According to Hans T. Bakker, their ruler Aditya-Vardhana (or Aditya-Sena) was probably a feudatory to Sharva-Varman, the Maukhari king of Kannauj. His successor Prabhakara-Vardhana may have also been a feudatory to the Maukhari king Avanti-Varman in his early days. Prabhakara's daughter Rajyashri married Avanti-Varman's son Graha-Varman. As a result of this marriage, Prabhakara's political status increased significantly, and he assumed the imperial title Parama-bhattaraka Maharajadhiraja. (\\"the one to whom the other kings bow because of his valour and affection\\"). According to the Harshacharita, after Prabhakara's death, the king of Malava attacked Kannauj, supported by the ruler of Gauda. The Malava king killed Graha-Varman, and captured Rajyashri. Bana does not mention this king, but historians speculate him to be a ruler of the Later Gupta dynasty. Prabhakara's elder son Rajya-Vardhana defeated the Malava ruler, but was killed by the Gauda king. The Harshacharita further states that Prabhakara's younger son Harsha-Vardhana then vowed to destroy the Gauda king and their allies. Again, Bana does not mention the name of the Gauda king, but historians identify him with Shashanka-Deva, a Maukhari vassal (mahasamanta). Harsha formed an alliance with Bhaskar Varman, the king of Kamarupa, and forced Shashanka to retreat. Subsequently, in 606 CE, Harsha was formally crowned as an emperor. He captured a large part of northern India (see the Empire of Harsha). There are different assessments of the exact extent of Harsha's empire, but he controlled major parts of northern India; his overlordship was accepted by the king of Vallabhi in the west and the Kamarupa king Bhaskaravarman in the east; in the south, his empire extended up to the Narmada River. Harsha eventually made Kanyakubja (modern Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh) his capital, and ruled till c. 647 CE. He died without an heir, leading to the end of the Pushyabhuti dynasty.

It was designed by Florence Mary Rigby and built . It is also known as Broadwater. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 March 2007.  History  The Glebe Homestead, overlooking the Dawson River to the northeast of Taroom, was completed . It is the second house on the property, erected after the first was destroyed by fire in 1915. It was built by and for the Rigby family, owners of The Glebe from 1900. European occupation of the Dawson River district followed explorer Ludwig Leichhardt's journey through the area in 1844, during his exploratory journey from Jimbour Homestead to Port Essington. Squatters soon followed, with a licence for Taroom Station issued in 1845. The town of Taroom, named after the station, was surveyed in 1860. Closer settlement commenced in the 1880s, with land resumptions and subdivision under the Crown Lands Act of 1884. Tenders to lease a pastoral holding known as Broadwater run (later The Glebe) were called in March 1851. It was not until November 1858 that the tender of George Bowman of Richmond was accepted for the 25 square mile run. The lease changed hands several times in the 1860s and 1870s. By the mid-1880s Broadwater was one of six runs comprising the consolidated run of Cockatoo Creek. No improvements had been made to the property and in 1888 Broadwater, along with three other Cockatoo Creek runs, was resumed for grazing selection. In August 1900 portions 14 and 15 (Grazing Farms 124 & 125) - a combined area of 29 square miles, formerly Broadwater run and with frontages to the Dawson River and Cockatoo Creek - were selected by George Beaumont Rigby, and named The Glebe. The property had very thick coolibah on the black soil river and creek flats, and dense brigalow, sandalwood and mulga scrub elsewhere. Rigby arrived in Taroom from England probably in the late 1870s. He found employment on Carrabah (formerly Taroom) run, where he formed a partnership with the manager, GC Langhorne, to acquire the 90,000 acre run from the Queensland National Bank in 1881. Whilst living at Carrabah, Rigby married Marian Frances Crawford in 1884 and five sons and one daughter were born to them. The partnership between Langhorne and Rigby dissolved in 1900 and in August of that year Rigby and his wife took up The Glebe. Rigby later acquired several adjoining blocks: an occupation license for Mountain Block (10 square miles) in 1907; a lease on Springvale (16 square miles) in 1921; and a lease on Price Creek, a 14 square mile block east of Springvale, by 1925. By September 1901 the Rigby family were living in a tent on The Glebe. By 1908 the selection had been improved with a residence, woolshed (the Rigbys ran sheep in conjunction with cattle until the late 1940s) and cultivated paddocks; by October 1915 improvements included an iron- roofed residence, a kitchen garden, woolshed, machinery, fencing and cultivation. Soon after this survey, in December 1915, the Rigby residence was destroyed by fire and it took some years for the family for construct another home, which they built themselves from materials available on the property and using traditional construction techniques. Work on cutting and milling timber for the new house commenced almost immediately, but construction was slow. This was the time of the Great War in Europe. Two of the Rigby sons were serving overseas in the armed forces; there was a war-generated shortage of building materials; the property had to be run; and much time and energy was being invested in eradicating the prickly pear that infested The Glebe and other properties in the Taroom district prior to the introduction of cactoblastis larvae in the 1920s. During this period (1916-1919) the family resided in what is now known as the machinery shed, with its slab walls and bark roof overlaid with sheets of corrugated iron. By early June 1921, when an appraisal of rent was made by the Lands Department, The Glebe homestead comprised a new house of 7 rooms, services laid on from 5,000 gallon tank supplied from river, outbuildings etc. Descendants understand that the new house was designed by Florence Mary Rigby - George and Marion's only daughter - with the main bedroom and living room separated from the rest of the house by a wide breezeway, which, though housed under the same roof, was open at both ends. A 1923 photograph was taken at The Glebe to commemorate a visit by the then Governor of Queensland, Sir Matthew Nathan. This and other photographs of the period 1920s to 1940s show the house largely unchanged, with the exception of a small bedroom later enclosed at the southwest corner of the verandah. By at least the 1930s, a Chinese market gardener had established a vegetable garden on land between the house and the river, but this is not known to have survived the 1940s. By the late 1930s an air-strip had been cleared just south of the house. George Beaumont Rigby died in 1931 and Marion Rigby in 1937. George had been very active in district affairs. He was an auditor of the Taroom District Hospital (established 1896), a position he held until his death, and was instrumental in establishing the Taroom Agricultural and Pastoral Society in the late 1890s. He was also a long- serving member of the Taroom Divisional Board (later Taroom Shire Council). The property remained in the Rigby family for over a century, until resumed for the proposed Nathan Dam early in the 21st century. The woolshed was destroyed by fire in 1997.  Description  Machinery shed, 2009 The Glebe Homestead is located approximately northeast of Taroom, on a low sandy ridge overlooking the Dawson River to the northwest. The homestead complex comprises a single-storeyed timber residence with early garden, tennis court and orchard; a two-storeyed shearers' quarters; a machinery shed; a s cottage clad with fibrous cement (not considered to be of heritage significance); and cattle yards to the south of the timber residence. = Timber residence and garden = The residence is constructed of horizontal drop slabs of sawn Moreton Bay Ash (Eucalyptus tessellaris) housed in recessed sections of vertical timber members. The whole is elevated on low timber stumps, and the charred remains of earlier stumps are extant beneath the house. The original layout of the residence is evident: four rooms (two on each side of a narrow passageway which opens off the southwest side of the building) separated by a wide breezeway from two larger rooms to the northeast, with wide verandahs to the southeast and northeast. A bungalow-style hipped roof clad with corrugated iron sheets comes down low over the verandahs, where it is supported on regularly spaced squared timber posts with later cast iron brackets. Several pairs of French doors open onto the verandahs from the interior. On the northwest side of the house is a small corrugated- iron gable roof over the northwest timber entrance steps to the breezeway. This breezeway is now enclosed with panels of doors and windows at either end. A later bathroom has been added to the northwest corner of the house, and a bedroom to the southwest corner, enclosing an existing verandah space. Internally much of the timber partitioning is lined with hessian and papered, and other timber walls are oiled with a mixture of linseed oil and turpentine. The timber ceilings have been covered in some places with fibrous cement sheeting. A large fireplace in the living/dining room has a timber surround. The house retains an extensive garden area, with early plantings including a plumbago hedge on the northeastern fence, a jasmine hedge along the northwestern fence, a climbing rose (Senica alba) near the northwest entrance to the house, and several early varieties of bougainvillea and crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia sp.). Just outside the fenced garden are three jacaranda trees (Jacaranda mimosifolia), two of which define what was once the main gate into the garden. To the southwest of the garden is an unsealed tennis court, which has a high fence of wire mesh supported by timber saplings. Remnants of an early orchard adjoin the northeastern garden fence. To the west of the garden is a row of early pepper trees (Macropiper excelsum). = Outbuildings = To the southwest, separated from the main residence by an area of cement-set stone paving, is a small timber framed and timber-clad laundry. Attached to this is a timber-framed, fibrous-cement sheeted shed. Further to the southwest, beyond the house yard, is a machinery shed that pre-dates the house. This is partially of slab construction and retains an early galvanised-iron gabled roof insulated with bark lining. It has skillion-roofed extensions along each side. Nearby is the former two-storeyed shearers' quarters, a gable-roofed, timber- framed building clad with sections of timber board and sheets of corrugated iron.  Heritage listing  The Glebe Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 March 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Glebe Homestead, completed by , is important in illustrating the pattern of settlement in the Taroom district, being associated with the pattern of land resumption in the district in late 19th and early 20th centuries. The manner in which the homestead was constructed, over a number of years and from materials recycled or obtained from the property, reflects the impact of the Great War of 1914-1918, during which many rural communities in Queensland suffered materials and labour shortages, and the additional impact of the widespread prickly pear infestation on properties in the northwest Darling Downs, which created financial strain for many landholders. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. A machinery shed on the site, which pre-dates the main residence, retains early bark lining beneath a corrugated iron roof, which is a rare surviving example of this form of construction. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The homestead has the potential to provide the opportunity for further archaeological research, as many of the buildings have survived intact with early machinery and fittings. The remains of an early building, which may be the previous house, are apparent beneath the present main residence. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The homestead, which comprises a main residence, garden with mature trees and other early plantings, tennis court and outbuildings, is an intact and working example of an early 20th century pastoral head station, constructed during a period of financial, material and manpower shortages, and is important in illustrating its type. The main residence is important as a late example of sawn timber slab construction and of traditional interior finishes, illustrating how traditional bush construction techniques were sustained in rural Queensland for many decades after initial settlement. The idiosyncratic design illustrates an appreciation of local climate conditions, and the whole reflects the need for self-sufficiency and the shortage of materials and labour during the first world war. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The main residence, set within a garden of mature trees and other early plantings, and outbuildings have aesthetic significance engendered by the rustic materials and picturesque setting in an open rural landscape.

The game was released on January 23, 2018 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, and August 2, 2018 for the Nintendo Switch and it was also was released on January 23, 2020 for Xbox One.  Gameplay  Iconoclasts is a 2D platformer with metroidvania elements. Gameplay involves a mixture of exploring, fighting enemies, and solving environmental puzzles using Robin's tools. The game has a plot that plays out as the player completes levels. The game places a lot of emphasis on boss battles, and there are well over twenty different bosses in the game. Robin gains several tools over the course of the game, each with both combat and puzzle-solving functions. The wrench is a melee weapon that is also used to turn bolts, grapple, and, later, electrify Robin or other tools and objects. The stun-gun can fire single shots and charge shots, and can destroy some obstacles. The roller bomb shot fires projectile timed explosives or charged missile shots, can destroy some obstacles, and can be electrified. The usurper shot fires piercing beams and a charge shot that causes Robin to exchange places with certain objects and enemies it hits. The characters Mina, Royal, and Elro join Robin's party at certain times throughout the game; they may assist in boss fights or become controllable by the player. By finding materials in treasure chests, Robin can craft Tweaks, which provide small gameplay bonuses such as increased melee damage, faster running speed, or unique abilities. Tweaks can only be equipped at save points; one Tweak becomes broken whenever Robin takes damage, and each Tweak must be repaired by refilling a gauge before becoming active again.  Plot  =Setting= The main character is Robin, a naive and helpful mechanic. She lives in a world where the sinister religious authority the One Concern, ruled by a being known as \\"Mother\\", has taken over the government, and allows only licensed mechanics to handle the power source called \\"Ivory\\" that drives its machines. Due to her attempts to help people in need despite being a self-taught mechanic, the soldiers of the One Concern track down Robin and label her a criminal and a heretic, which forces her to escape along with her allies and fight back against the One Concern. Ivory, a white liquid said to exist in all matter on the planet, is venerated by the One Concern as a holy substance. In addition to powering machines, it can grant supernatural abilities to select few humans through fusion with their blood. Those who survive but become mutilated in the process become Agents, legal enforcers possessing extraordinary strength, long lifespans, and a range of superpowers; those who flawlessly survive the process, such as Mother and her successor Royal, are extolled as Mediums, destined leaders of the human race, possessing telekinetic power over all matter containing Ivory. A conflicting religion is practiced by the Isi, a people who live underwater thanks to excavated technology, powered by harvesting Ivory from the ocean floor through different means than those of the surface dwellers. The One Concern engages in armed conflict against the Isi, labeling them \\"pirates.\\" During the course of the game, it is revealed that Ivory supplies are dwindling due to exploitation by both the One Concern and the Isi; not only has research into replacement power sources failed or been regarded as a regression, but the planet's structure has also destabilized due to deprivation of Ivory, causing intermittent earthquakes believed to indicate the impending death of the planet. =Synopsis= Robin is a unregistered mechanic in her community, following in her father's footsteps despite the threat of the One Concern; her brother Elro is a Concern chemist secretly carrying out subversive research while raising his family. One day, Concern agents Black and White surprise Robin while she is repairing Elro's house. As punishment, the house is destroyed, killing his family, and Robin is thrown in prison where she befriends and escapes with Mina, a member of an outcast religious group called the Isi. On the run, Robin encounters Royal, the heir to Mother, leader of the concern. Royal helps Robin evade General Chrome, chief of the Concern military, and Mina takes them both to the hidden settlement Isilugar. They fend off a Concern attack, killing agent White in the process, and Black retreats after taking Mina's partner Samba captive. The search for Samba brings Robin, Elro, and Mina to a secret Concern structure where children are being brainwashed to form the foundation of a new, cult-like society. Although they rescue Samba, Agent Black rips Elro's arm off over an old wrong and prepares to kill him, but General Chrome intervenes and has him sent to a Concern hospital, much to Black's dismay. In the chaos, Robin is thrown into an underground facility, where she is reunited with Royal. They accidentally activate and defeat a massive alien machine, but it transmits a signal up into the sky as it is destroyed. Royal offers to help Robin infiltrate the One Concern's headquarters to rescue Elro, but to his dismay finds himself condemned for the signal transmission- he has accidentally summoned the Starworm, a spacefaring entity the Concern worships as a god, to destroy the planet. The Concern activates an emergency plan to evacuate its leadership to one of the moons on a rocket. General Chrome, learning of this, decides the Concern has lost its way and starts an insurrection. After rescuing Elro, Royal seeks an audience with Mother, who rejects and attacks him, forcing Robin to kill her. As the One Concern collapses into civil war, Chrome corners the group and prepares to execute them to clear the field for his new regime, but is himself killed by Elro. Royal convinces everyone to help him hijack the escape rocket and confront the Starworm himself on the moon. Agent Black resolves to stop them, but is killed after transforming into a monstrous creature. Upon arriving at the moon base, Royal gets the Starworm's attention, but it ignores his entreaties until he goes too far and damages it with his powers, provoking it into breaching the base's hull. Royal sinks into despair and Robin is forced to leave him behind and return home in an escape capsule. The Starworm burrows into the planet and everyone tries to make their peace with the seemingly imminent end of the world. Robin, optionally accompanied by Mina depending on dialog choices, goes to its landing site and exploits the damage Royal did to incapacitate it. The Starworm is revealed to be a vehicle piloted by a large birdlike alien, who had expected to drain the planet of its ivory to refuel. After the alien is defeated, the Starworm ruptures and discharges a vast amount of ivory, rejuvenating the ecosystem. Robin returns home and takes a well-deserved nap.

This was due to the heavy influx of Arab refugees coming from the Iberian Peninsula to the Maghreb and the Levant following the fall of Al-Andalus to the Catholic Monarchs.  Introduction  Omar Beik Daouk during his leadership throughout the Ottoman Era.280x280px Prime Minister Ahmad Daouk during his second mandate. 300x300px Downtown Beirut The Daouk Family is known as one of the 'Seven Families of Beirut' along the other six families; the Mneimneh Family, the Sinno Family, the Kreidiyyeh Family, the Itani Family, the Doughan Family and the Houry Family. The Daouk Family members mostly reside in Ras Beirut and other districts within the Lebanese Capital. Other smaller communities of the family may also reside in California, Ontario, Quebec, Marrakesh and Syrian cities such as Damascus and Hama. The majority of the family adhere to either the Sunni faith of Islam or Christianity.  Current  As of today, the family is mostly known for the Izzat Daouk franchise and Mohammad Amin Daouk who is the President of Nejmeh SC, one of the oldest and most successful Lebanese football clubs. Other influential members include Walid Daouk who was the Information Minister of Lebanon in 2011 and Amine Mohammad Daouk, the president of the Makassed Organization. The social status of the family has been prominent throughout the past two centuries especially in Lebanese governance and politics. The most two notable members are Omar Beik Daouk and Ahmad Daouk. Omar served as the first Head of State of Beirut throughout the Ottoman Era. Ahmad Daouk was the Prime Minister of Lebanon in 1941 and 1960; he was also Minister of National Defense in his own cabinet. During his period as Prime Minister, Lebanon enjoyed very close relationships and alliances with the United States and France. Omar Daouk had 2 sons, Mohamed and Hasan. Hasan Omar Daouk's wife, Hassana Fathallah-Daouk, was a prominent philanthropist member of several cultural organizations, such as the Lebanese Red Cross. She was also president of the Child and Mother Welfare Society, which runs a hospital, senior housing, and a development and career training center promoting the health and social success of modest income families in Beirut. She has a street named after her near the headquarters of that organization. Hassana was awarded the Lebanese Golden Medal of Achievement, the highest civilian honor awarded by the Republic of Lebanon. The family's members currently run an annual event by where all members of the extensive family meet each and get to know each other. Such events are regularly hosted in Beirut's Movenpick Hotel. The Lebanese sweet 'Daoukieh' was named after the family due to its creator who was Daouk. May Daouk currently owns one of Beirut's mostly beautiful and rare villas. Its uniqueness comes from the fact that the villa is a blend of traditional Beiruti-Lebanese architecture with a hint of a modern touch of May's choice. The villa has been featured on many websites and social media networks such as Pinterest and Architectural Digest.  Legacy  The legacy of the Daouk Family is one that is noteworthy, to the extent that two streets in the Beirut Central District are named after them. Omar Daouk Street is situated at the heart of the Lebanese Capital minutes away from Downtown Beirut (Coordinates: 33¬∞53'55\\"N 35¬∞29'53\\"E.) The street consists of two parallel roads, with residential and commercial buildings in between the roads that merge at the Omar Daouk Square. \\"The Omar Daouk Square was designed by Mohammad Halawi around a bust by Maguerditch Mazmanian of Omar Daouk himself. With the aim of upgrading the square from a green island into a space connected to the surroundings, the new design of the Omar Daouk Square enlarges its size, introduces three terraces to soften the site incline, and creates an attractive open area where one can sit and rest.\\" Ahmad Daouk Street (Coordinates: 33¬∞54'3.61\\"N35¬∞30'0.00\\" E) is perpendicular to Bab Idriss, which is connected to Omar Daouk Street. The street is two blocks from the Lebanese parliament and consists of a double-way two lane road connecting Beirut's Corniche Road to the Beirut Central District. The Daouk Family historically resided in The Rose House in Ras Beirut. Alongside the Adrati Family, the Daouk Family preserved the Beirut landmark that was built in 1882 having settled in the villa for nearly three decades. Today it is currently owned outside the family by Hisham Jaroudi.

The Denny Clay Company and its successors both mined clay and produced clay products in Taylor, which were then transported via rail. Coal was also mined in Taylor, which in turn could be used in the furnaces used to dry the clay. Besides the mine, factory and housing, the town was also home to a hotel, saloon and a post office called Taylor was established in 1904 which remained in operation until 1944. While one of the major clay items produced at Taylor was sewer pipes, it did not have a sophisticated sewage treatment system itself and the city of Seattle was concerned the waste water from town would pollute the city's water supply. This led to the city eventually condemning the town in 1947. Present day Remnants of factory in the ghost town of Taylor, Washington in September 2018.

On 20 July 1917 he was awarded the Croix de guerre. Following a successful operation at Merkem in April 1918, Michiels was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour by Ferdinand Foch. In March 1919 Michiels became a professor at the Instruction Center of Staff (later the War College, part of the Royal Military Academy), where he would work for nearly 12 years. As a major, he would privately instruct Prince (later King) Leopold III on war studies. In 1927 Michiels was due to be transferred out of the school and given command of a battalion, but his commanding officer objected. He left his position at the college as a lieutenant colonel in June 1931 and became chief of staff of the First Army Corps. In March of the following year he was made colonel. Two years later he was made commander of the First Grenadiers Regiment. In June 1937 Michiels was promoted to major general and made head of the personnel department of the Defence Ministry. Following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Michiels took command of the reserve Seventh Infantry Division to oversee its mobilization. This division was soon assigned the task of improving the defences along the Dyle. After several weeks, it was moved to protect the Albert Canal. Michiels was appointed King Leopold III's chief of staff on 2 February 1940. He subsequently served in this capacity during the Battle of Belgium. During the Belgian Army's last stand at the Battle of the Lys on 27 May, Michiels suggested that the king send a representative to the Germans to negotiate a ceasefire. King Leopold III followed this advice, and eventually agreed to surrender to the Germans the following morning. British Admiral Roger Keyes commended Michiels for his display of high morale during the campaign. On 30 May, Michiels gave a speech to all the senior Belgian officers, thanking them for their service. He asked the army staff to remain with him to assist in managing the confused state of affairs following the capitulation. The Germans inquired him on Belgium's observance of neutrality before the invasion and on the Mechelen incident, but he refused to offer them any answers. Michiels was then taken prisoner by the Germans. He was deported with the army staff to prisoner of war camps in central Europe. The Germans offered to return him to Belgium in 1943 and hand him control of the National Office of Veterans Affairs, but he refused on the account that he would be leaving his subordinates behind. He was liberated from a camp near Prenzlau by the Red Army on 7 May 1945. Repatriated, Michiels retired from the army in late 1945 and began writing a book on the Battle of Belgium. Michiels died on 14 June 1946 and was buried with full military honors. His book, 18 jours de guerre en Belgique, was published posthumously the following year.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008.  History  Hornet Bank station in the upper Dawson River district was taken up in 1853 by Andrew Scott and the homestead, on a reduced acreage, remains the property of his direct descendants. In 1857 the station was the site of the killing by local Aborigines of eleven settlers, eight of whom were members of the Fraser family, who were managing Hornet Bank for Scott. The Hornet Bank massacre resonated deeply in colonial circles, escalating the frontier war in the Dawson River district and prejudicing subsequent European-Indigenous relationships throughout Queensland for decades. Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichhardt led the first European exploration of the upper Dawson River district in 1845. Within two years of this expedition European settlement in the area had commenced, with squatters attracted by Leichhardt's glowing reports of its rich pastoral land. One of the earliest settlers in the region was Andrew Scott, who took up the first of the Hornet Bank blocks in 1853. Andrew Scott, circa 1880 Born in Scotland in 1810, Scott arrived in Australia in the late 1830s. He gained pastoral experience at the property of his future father-in-law, Robert Brodie, in the Hunter Valley district of New South Wales. Taking advantage of the newly opening pastoral districts in the north, in September 1853 he applied for a pastoral lease along the Dawson River. The Aboriginal name for the lease area was Gaganybilany, but Scott reputedly named it Hornet Bank after he was attacked by a hornet swarm there. In March 1854 John Fraser, a Scotsman who had worked as a bookkeeper at Jimbour Station on the Darling Downs before moving to Drayton, took on the management of Hornet Bank for Scott and moved there with his wife Martha and their children. In May 1856, while overlanding Hornet Bank sheep to Ipswich, John Fraser became ill and subsequently died in town. Mrs Fraser stayed on at Hornet Bank and her eldest son William, who had established himself as a carrier based at Ipswich, returned to the property to look after the family. William, however, was often away for months at a time in connection with his business. Around this time tension was increasing between local Aborigines, the Jiman (or Yeeman) people, and the settlers along the Dawson River. A series of incidents in 1856 and 1857 culminated in the killings at Hornet Bank Homestead. As the most western station along the Dawson River, Hornet Bank was an easy target for Aboriginal attack and in late October 1857 it was relatively unguarded with William Fraser absent from the station. The events that unfolded at Hornet Bank in the early morning of 27 October 1857, described in the contemporary press as a \\"dreadful calamity\\", resulted in the death of eleven inhabitants of the station, including eight members of the Fraser family, all of whom were women and children, attacked at the homestead. The sole survivor was Sylvester Fraser, the second youngest son of the family, who was aged 15 at the time. The victims were buried on the property. In October 1957, to commemorate the centenary of the killings, a concrete memorial was erected on the grave site by Andrew Scott's descendants. The Hornet Bank killings revived squatter agitation for greater frontier protection and in the following six months a 'squatter's crusade', supported by sections of the colonial press, was waged throughout the Dawson and Burnett districts by small bands of squatters and Native Police. It has been estimated that several hundred Aborigines were killed during this period. Sporadic warfare continued in the Dawson River area to 1870. Despite the 1857 tragedy, Andrew Scott retained ownership of Hornet Bank Station. In 1860 he married Robert Brodie's daughter Christina, but the couple did not reside permanently at Hornet Bank until the frontier violence had been quelled. During the mid-1860s Hornet Bank was managed by Andrew Gordon, with whom Scott was in partnership. This was a period of physical expansion for the Hornet Bank head station, with a number of new structures erected, all of timber slab construction. Scott's father-in-law, Robert Brodie, was a stonemason by trade and is believed to have built most of the 1860s slab buildings at Hornet Bank prior to his death there in 1867. Reportedly, after a new slab homestead was completed , the house formerly used by the Fraser family was used as a store. Gordon Reid, author of A Nest of Hornets (1982), described the original house as \\"like the usual bush hut of those days; it had a verandah and a bark roof, and was divided into three main rooms - a sitting room, a store and a sleeping room, the last being in the middle.\\" Andrew Scott had acquired numerous properties in the Leichhardt district by the mid-1880s, when Hornet Bank was one of 19 runs he consolidated as the 640 square mile Goongarry Station. In November 1887 the oldest improvements on Hornet Bank were the woolshed and associated yards and pens, which were 30 years old (i.e. erected ). The main house, constructed of shingles, slabs and sawn timber and the store, of shingle and slab with excavated cellars, were recorded as 22 years old (i.e., erected ). A cottage of sawn timber with an iron roof had just been erected (). At this time the head station also contained a buggy and dray shed, a meat house, a school house of slabs with an iron roof, and a stables. No mention was made in the 1887 report of a slab house or store dating to the 1850s. Of the structures on Hornet Bank extant in 1887, only the slab building survives. That the residence associated with the 1857 killings had been removed was confirmed in 1916-1917, when the station was visited by the Royal Commission into Public Works enquiring into a proposed railway from Juandah (now Wandoan) to Taroom: \\"When the Commissioners visited Hornet Bank during one of their inspection tours they found that the old homestead where the massacre occurred was removed and in its stead a more up-to-date residence erected.\\"Queensland Parliamentary Papers 1916-17 Vol.3 p1057 \\"Royal Commission into Public Works\\" Appendix F: \\"Notes made by the Secretary of the Commission (Mr JTH Bird) on the history of Taroom and surrounding district.\\" p87 On Andrew Scott's death in 1892, Hornet Bank passed to his sons.  Description  Closeup of the memorial, 2008 The Fraser family grave is located approximately northwest of the Hornet Bank home yard, beyond a waterhole. The site is marked by a fence of hollow metal rails between low timber posts. There is no evidence of individual graves or headstones within this enclosure. A stepped three-tiered concrete plinth stands to the middle of the fenced area and accommodates a plaque, with the inscription: > In memory of the Fraser family who were massacred at the station homestead > by the aborigines on October 27th 1857. > Erected by the descendants of the late Andrew Scott, founder of Hornet Bank > September 8, 1853. Unveiled 27th October 1957. A small metal plaque at the base of the front face of the memorial records: > Hugh T Scott & J Hamilton, Builders  Heritage listing  The Fraser family grave site and memorial at Hornet Bank was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Fraser family grave site and memorial is significant for its association with early non-Indigenous settlement on the upper Dawson River region, during a period of violent interaction between European pastoralists and Indigenous people. Hornet Bank station, established in 1853, was one of the earliest pastoral runs taken up in the Leichhardt district. In 1857 the head station was the site of an attack by Aborigines in which eleven inhabitants of the station were killed, including eight members of the Fraser family, all of whom were buried on the property. The Hornet Bank killings escalated a sporadic frontier war in the Dawson River area until Indigenous resistance was quelled by 1870, and prejudiced subsequent European-Indigenous relationships throughout Queensland for decades. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Through archaeological investigation of the grave site combined with extensive documentary material relating to the 1857 killings at Hornet Bank, the place has the potential to yield information that will contribute to further understanding of frontier relations between Aborigines and non-Indigenous settlers.

In Bavaria there was also the title of pflegskommiss√§r, given to someone who represented a pfleger as required (in the sense of a \\"commissarial\\" or \\"acting\\" pfleger). In the Late Middle Ages the pfleger developed into an official with administrative and juridical tasks. In the Old Empire, i.e. the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation until its dissolution in 1806, a church parish (Kirchspiel) or a captaincy (Hauptmannschaft; Hauptmann = captain) was usually the lowest level of administration. In the Rhineland, however, larger parishes were sometimes subdivided into Honnschaften. Several parishes were combined into a Pflegamt, or in the Rhineland a Pflege. In charge of these offices was usually a pfleger or his representative who, as the administrative officer and proctor, looked after public law and order and recorded agreements and treaties. For this purpose, pfleger were often recruited from the ranks of the lower nobility (vassals) in the countryside (Landadel). Sometimes there were pfleger who were promoted from the peasantry to hold office. Formerly the sovereign exercised the functions of the legislature; on his behalf the pfleger carried out the other two functions in a given area which was e.g. the size of a present-day county or Kreis. The pfleger thus carried out the functions of today's district administrator and magistrate in personal union (in Austria-Hungary until 1918). Pfleger was also the title given to the head of an Amt in the administrative hierarchy of the Teutonic Order. The Teutonic Order was divided into commandries, which in turn consisted of Amts. The pfleger was basically a Teutonic knight and chief administrative officer of the Amt. At a central location in the Amt there was always a Teutonic castle or Ordensburg where the pfleger had his seat. The function of the Roman governor, Quirinius, in the province of Syria was translated by Martin Luther as Landpfleger (\\"[I]t happened that at the time of the Emperor Augustus, .... when Cyrenius was Landpfleger of Syria .... \\").Lutheran Bible Clearly Luther assumed that at that time people would be familiar with the functions of a pfleger.

As a result of frontier changes, he grew up, after 1919, in Czechoslovakia, and from 1938 found himself a citizen of an enlarged Germany. It was primarily because of his political activism that he was detained at the Buchenwald concentration camp between September 1939 and April 1944. Having survived this internment, his scientific skills opened up a range of career options internationally: between 1945 he lived and worked successively in Scotland, England, the United States, Brazil and Israel. Kurt Sitte was arrested on espionage charges on 15 June 1960 and, as Israel's first convicted spy, spent the next three and a half years in prison. Early release, in March 1963, resulted from his \\"good behaviour\\", at which point he was quoted as saying that he would be \\"glad\\" to continue to work in Israel, but shortly after this he took West German citizenship and relocated to Freiburg where he pursued his academic career at the university. Life =Provenance and early years= Kurt Sitte was born in Reichenberg, a mid-sized city in North Bohemia that had industrialised and grown rapidly during the previous century. Even after the termination of Austro-Hungary and the transfer of Reichenberg to the new state of Czechoslovakia in 1919, Reichenberg remained ethnically, linguistically and culturally a German city right up till 1944/45. Kurt Sitte's father, also called Kurt Sitte, was a head teacher and a painter. After completing his Abitur (school leaving exams), Kurt Sitte moved on to the Charles-Ferdinand (German) University in Prague where he studied Maths and Physics, and where he obtained his doctorate in 1932. His habilitation, which was in Physics, followed just three years later, in 1935, after which he took a teaching position.Wer ist wer? 32nd edition, Verlag Schmidt-R√∂mhild, L√ºbeck 1993, , p. 1292 He also presided over a leftist discussion group known as \\"Die Tat\\" (\\"the deed\\") back in Reichenberg and participated in the Sudeten German Anti-Nazi Resistance movement. At the time of the Sudeten Crisis (and shortly before the Munich Agreement), Kurt Sitte was a co-founder, on 18 September 1938, of the \\"National Council of all Peace motivated Sudeten Germans\\" (\\"Nationalrats aller friedenswilligen Sudetendeutschen\\").Detlef Brandes: Die Sudetendeutschen im Krisenjahr 1938. R. Oldenbourg, M√ºnchen 2008, , p. 285 At some point around 1938 Kurt Sitte married Kheda Kraus, a nurse working in Prague. The marriage would end in divorce. His wife remarried in 1958. =Buchenwald= In March 1939, soon after Czechoslovakia had been annexed to Germany, Sitte was expelled from the university and arrested. He was imprisoned briefly in Prague and then moved to the Dachau concentration camp before he and his wife, as \\"political detainees\\", were transferred to Buchenwald in September 1939. Sitte was not Jewish, but his wife was, in part. Early in 1942 Sitte began working in the SS-Pathology department at the concentration camp where he was employed as a deputy to the \\"Kapo\\" . Wegerer was a chemical engineer, and according to Eugen Kogon, who was also held at Buchenwald and survived, Wegerer and Sitte provided training courses on medical and biological topics to interested fellow inmates.Ronald Hirte/Harry Stein: Die Beziehungen der Universit√§t Jena zum Konzentrationslager Buchenwald. In: Uwe Ho√üfeld, J√ºrgen John, Oliver Lehmuth und R√ºdiger Stutz (Hrsg.): ‚ÄûK√§mpferische Wissenschaft‚Äú. Studien zur Universit√§t Jena im Nationalsozialismus. K√∂ln 2003, , p. 386 Another beneficiary of their erudition was the concentration camp doctor, Waldemar Hoven who during this time obtained a doctorate with a dissertation entitled \\"Investigations into the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis through the inhalation of colloidal carbon\\" (\\"Versuche zur Behandlung der Lungentuberkulose durch Inhalation von Kohlekolloid\\"). It subsequently transpired that the dissertation had been compiled by Wegerer and Sitte. As the end of the war approached, on 11 April 1945 Kurt Sitte was one of those freed from the Buchenwald concentration camp by members of the United States Army. His wife had also survived Buchenwald. =After the war= Kurt Sitte identifies human skin taken from dead prisoners at the trial of former camp personnel and prisoners from Buchenwald, 1947, 16 April Between 1946 and 1948 Sitte and his wife lived in Britain where he was employed as a university research fellow at Edinburgh and Manchester. Their son Martin was born in 1946. Starting in April 1947 Sitte appeared as a witness at the Buchenwald Trial. He identified examples of \\"processed\\" human skin from the camp. He testified that the principal processes had taken place at Buchenwald, based on intended uses decided elsewhere. His evidence affected the so-called \\"Buchenwald Commander\\", Ilse Koch, whose death sentence was subsequently reduced to a four-year jail term because no incriminating evidence was produced that she had selected prisoners for murder according to the tattoos on their skin, nor that she was in possession of any objects made from human skin.Arthur Lee Smith Jr.: Der Fall Ilse Koch ‚Äì Die Hexe von Buchenwald, B√∂hlau Verlag, K√∂ln/Weimar/Wien, 3. Auflage 1995, , p. 128 The US military tribunal which reduced her sentence in 1948 based its decision on various considerations, taking the view that her earlier conviction and sentencing had been excessively dependent on hearsay evidence. In this connection Sitte later found himself being questioned about his experiences at Buchenwald by an enquiry commission of the US senate. The senators had got hold of a shrunken head from Buchenwald, and Sitte was able to confirm that it was indeed a human head and that it was one of two shrunken heads formerly in the collection of the SS-Pathology department at the concentration camp. The heads were those of two camp internees who in 1939 or 1940 had attempted to escape from Buchenwald but been caught. They had been physically punished before an assembly of their fellow inmates and later hanged.Lawrence Douglas: The Shrunken Head of Buchenwald: Icons of Atrocity at Nuremberg. In: Barbie Zelizer: Visual Culture and the Holocaust, Rutgers, The State University, 2001, , p. 298 Even in the context of those times, the power to shock of the testimony Sitte was able to provide stands out. In 1948 he relocated to the United States, taking a position as a Professor of Physics at Syracuse University, roughly equidistant between Buffalo and Albany in Upstate New York. Here he embarked on research in nuclear physics and cosmic radiation. In 1953 he became a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. In the age of McCarthyism, Sitte was the object of official suspicion during his years in the United States, both because of his left-wing politics in the 1930s and because of the contacts he maintained with Czechoslovak communists whom he knew from his time in Buchenwald, and whom he continued to visit even after the Communist take-over in 1948. It was at the instigation of the FBI that in 1953 Sitte's residence permit was not renewed, and he accordingly relocated again, this time to Brazil. He took a teaching post as a visiting professor at the University of S√£o Paulo. Shortly afterwards his inclusion on a list of security risks was confirmed when he booked a flight to Rome that included a transfer in New York City. When Sitte asked if he might stay at a hotel overnight the New York authorities refused his request, placed him under a heavy police guard, and bundled him onto the first available flight out of the country, which took him not to Italy, but back to Brazil. =Israeli espionage conviction= By 1954 Kurt Sitte had become widely respected as an expert in nuclear physics, and in October he accepted a post at the Israel Institute of Technology (\\"Technion\\") in Haifa, where he set up the Nuclear Physics department and became its head. Further official recognition followed in 1955 with his appointment as the president of the Israeli Physics Society. Because of his various offices and duties he also acquired knowledge of research projects in nuclear physics at the Weizmann Institute just outside Tel Aviv and at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Sitte was also entrusted with overseas research contracts, including space projects of the US Air Force. In 1959 he became deputy chief of the supervisory council of the research institute which was dominated by US, British and Canadians, and in this way he became familiar with the practical evaluation of the space research that was undertaken there. Because of his exposed position Sitte was subject to surveillance by the Israeli Intelligence Services. He drew suspicion through his visits to communist Czechoslovakia and because of two stays in the Soviet Union. More brazen still, from the start of the 1960s, was a series of conspiratorial meetings with a blacklisted (by Israeli intelligence) Czechoslovak diplomat in various caf√©s. Early in June 1960 Sitte asked his staff to produce written reports on their research projects. In the end Sitte was arrested at his villa in Haifa on 15 June 1960 and the property was searched. His arrest was based on the allegation that he had betrayed state secrets to an (unnamed) foreign power. In the interrogation that followed Sitte admitted to his contacts with Czechoslovak diplomats. His sister and aging mother were still living in Czechoslovakia, and he testified that he had been keen to protect their positions, and that conversations involving scientific matters had simply involved the free exchange of information among scientists. The Israeli intelligence services reported that Sitte had been afraid that his research on cosmic rays as a potential energy source could lead to a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was in order to prevent such an outcome that he had divulged information to the Soviets. The actual trial was launched in the Haifa district court on 5 November 1960. The public were excluded, but it is known that the secret trial involved crimes against the Israeli National Security Act of 1957. On 7 February Kurt Sitte was sentenced to a five-year jail term for passing on secret information to a foreign power. The sentence was appealed, but without success. However, because of \\"good behaviour\\" he was released early, on 26 March 1963. =Professor in Freiburg= In 1963 Kurt Sitte married, as his second wife, Judith Sitte-Amon (born Judith/Yehudit Krymokowski) and the couple relocated to West Germany. The couple had a son. Between 1963 and 1971 Sitte was a professor (initially a visiting professor) at the Albert-Ludwig University of Freiburg in the southwest of the country. He combined this, between 1964 and 1967, with work at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg. Between 1970 and 1983 he belonged to the scientific committee of the Cosmo-Geophysical Laboratory of the Italian National Research Council, based in Turin, where he had been employed as a teaching professor between 1966 and 1970.K√ºrschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender, Vol 3, Walter de Gruyter, 1992, p. 3526 He was also the author of numerous scientific papers.
