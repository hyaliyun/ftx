He rose through the ranks to become the owner of the Liverpool Courier newspaper and sat in the House of Commons from 1892 to 1905.  Early life  Willox was born in Edinburgh, the son of the journalist John Willox who also wrote several books related to shipping. His family moved to Liverpool, where he was educated at Liverpool College.  Career  Leaving school in his mid-teens, Willox was apprenticed to the journalists Lee and Nightingale. They seconded him to the Liverpool Courier, which was then published twice each week. He became a sub-editor, then a partner in Tinling & Co which owned the paper. By 1863, aged only 21, he was the editor. Under Willox's editorship, the paper promptly became a daily, with a Saturday Weekly Courier. The Evening Courier was established in 1870 and became the Evening Express. He was a member of the Institute of Journalists and chairman of the Press Association in 1875 and 1900. = Tobacco and marriage = In 1884, he was an executor of the will of Thomas Cope, the founder of Cope Brothers tobacco merchants. He became a director of the company in 1885. When Thomas's brother George died in 1888 he became managing director, and married Thomas's widow, Sara (died 1904). who had ten children from her first marriage. She was a philanthropist, and 1897 she donated the ¬£15,000 cost of constructing the Sanitorium for Consumptives at Delamere Forest in Cheshire. = Electricity = Willox took an interest in the commercial development of electricity, and became a director of several companies in that field. He became chairman of the Blackheath and Greenwich District Electric Light Company, and also of the New St Helens and District Tramway Company and the South Lancashire Electric Traction and Power Company. = Politics = Abercromby Square in Liverpool, where Willox died After his marriage, Willox had become more involved in public affairs. When Edward Whitley, the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Everton died in January 1892, Willox was selected as the Conservative candidate for the resulting by-election. Everton was a Conservative safe seat, which the party had held since its creation in 1885, and Willox was regarded as a strong candidate. The local Liberal Party therefore decided not to contest the election, and Willox was returned unopposed. In honour of his election, over 100 journalists from Liverpool presented him with an illuminated address. Willox was re-elected with a large majority at the general election in July 1892, and was returned unopposed in 1895 and 1900. He was knighted in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Honours in 1897.  Death  Sir John became seriously ill in late 1904. When his wife Sara died, he attended her funeral at Anfield Cemetery on 17 December, but was really too ill to go out, and had to be supported by two stepsons. He resigned from Parliament in February 1905 by taking the Chiltern Hundreds, triggering another by-election. He died on his 63rd birthday, 16 June 1905, at his home on Abercromby Square, Liverpool.

The shoelace knot is a doubly slipped reef knot formed by joining the ends of whatever is being tied with a half hitch, folding each of the exposed ends into a loop (bight) and joining the loops with a second half hitch. The size of the loops and the length of the exposed ends are adjusted when the knot is tied. It has the stability of the reef knot but is significantly easier to untie, simply by pulling the ends away from the center of the knot. The loops are sometimes referred to as \\"bunny ears\\", especially when the knot is taught to children.  Techniques  There are several ways to tie a shoelace knot; each starts with the tying of a half hitch, and requires attention or some habitual mechanism for arriving at a knot that is an elaboration of the reef (or square) knot rather than of the granny (or lubber's) knot. If the bow is horizontal across the opening the bow is correctly and securely tied, but if vertical is likely to slip. One approach is to start by taking, in each hand, the end of the lace that emerges from the uppermost eyelet on that hand's side of the shoe; then passing the dominant hand's end under the other end, from front toward back, and dropping each lace on the opposite side from where it started; and in the finishing step again grasping the lace on each side with the hand on that side (perhaps taking time to note that because each end crossed over the shoe before, the laces have switched hands‚Äîor vice versa, the hands have switched laces) and again passing the dominant hand's end under the other end, from front toward back. * The simplest approach to describe is to also form a loop by bending each lace end back toward the closest part of the same lace, then join the two loops in another half hitch, in the second passing-back-under described before these bullet points. * Another common procedure (especially for bow ties) is to form a loop at one of the ends of the initial half-hitch, and circle it with the other end, which is simultaneously folded into a second loop that is then pushed through the knot. * The quickest approach is said to be one involving making one loop between the thumb and forefinger of each hand, and pulling each loop through the other; speed probably requires acquisition of muscle memory via repetition that is guided by a sequence of images. = More secure shoe-tying knots = A variation of the procedure involves looping the top part of the knot twice instead of once, resulting in a finished bow of almost identical appearance but with the laces wrapped twice around the middle. This Double Slip Knot holds the shoelaces more securely tied while still allowing them to be untied with a (slightly firmer) pull on the loose end(s). (Knot #1219) One variation, the subject of a U.S. patent, begins with a surgeon knot and has an upper double slip knot on top of that. Lace locking can be added for addition security. = A less secure shoe-tying knot = Tying two consecutive right-over-left half knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half knots) produces, instead of a square-knot-like bow-knot, a much less secure version corresponding to the granny knot. This version will also produce asymmetrical slips; one pointing down, the other up. = The corset bow = Just as it is possible to stack a number of half hitches to create a longer knot - remembering the reverse direction each time - which is equivalent to tying one reef knot on top of another, so bows which need to reduce ling lengths, such as corset tapes, can be tied on top of each other, slipping every other layer.

The son of Richard Clarke and his wife Mary n√©e Millard, he was educated in Liverpool. He left school early, entering employment with a relative. In 1873 he married Rebecca Potter and in 1875 became a partner in Potter & Clarke Limited, wholesale druggists, of Artillery Lane, London. He lived in the Peckham area of South London, and was a member of the Coopers Company of the City of London. A Baptist, he was a member of the Metropolitan Tabernacle. At the 1895 general election he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Dulwich for the Liberal Party. In 1898 he was elected to the London County Council as a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party majority group, representing Peckham.

With the creation of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell in 1900, Clarke was made an alderman on the borough council, and was mayor of Camberwell in 1902‚Äì1903. The 1906 general election was Clarke's third attempt to enter the Commons, and he was chosen to contest the constituency of Peckham. There was a large swing to the Liberals, and he won the seat, defeating the sitting Conservative member of parliament Sir Frederick Banbury. Although not formally a member of the Liberal-Labour group, he was described by The Times as \\"an addition to the Labour group of members\\".

Longworth Dames was born in Bath in 1850, the eldest son of George Longworth Dames and Caroline Amelia Brunswick. Longworth Dames passed the Indian Civil Service examination in 1868, and on his arrival in India in 1870 was posted to the Punjab. He served continuously till his retirement in 1897, apart from in 1879 when he was on special duty with the troops during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Much of his service was passed in the trans-Indus district of Dera Ghazi Khan, where he had opportunities for studying the Baluch people (Baloch) and became an authority on the various dialects of the Baluch and Pushtu languages. In 1891 he published a Baluchi grammar and textbook, which was used for many years by students. He contributed in 1904 to the monograph series of the Royal Asiatic Society an account of the Baluch, and in the following year the Royal Asiatic and the Folk-Lore Societies jointly published in two volumes his Popular Poetry of the Baluchis. In 1903 he contributed to the Folk-Lore Journal an article on \\"Folk-Lore of the Azores.\\" He was an ardent student of Buddhist art on the north-west frontier of India, and brought with him from there a fine collection of sculpture of the Gandhara period. He also did valuable service in rearranging the Buddhist rooms of the British Museum. For more than twenty years he served the Royal Asiatic Society, for part of the time as a Vice-President and Joint-Treasurer, and in 1921 he acted as Honorary Secretary. After his retirement he prepared several important articles for the Encyclopaedia of Islam on subjects relating to that part of northern India which he had studied so closely. Besides Oriental languages he was an excellent Portuguese scholar, and his wide knowledge of Portuguese literature, and of the philology and geography of India, was illustrated in his translation and annotations of The Book of Duarte Barbosa, edited for the Hakluyt Society in 1918‚Äì21. He compiled a memoir on the Portuguese and German colonies in Africa for the use of the 1919 Peace Congress at Versailles. He was also a member of the Numismatic Society and possessed a fine collection of oriental coins. Longworth Dames became a member of the Folk-Lore Society in 1892 and served for many years on the Council. In 1877 he married Mary Jane Ivens. They had one daughter.

It is associated with the transmission of beech bark disease because the puncture holes it makes in the bark allow entry of pathogenic fungi which have been identified as Nectria coccinea var. faginata and sometimes Nectria galligena.U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service History and distribution Cryptococcus fagisuga aka Beech bark disease has been recorded as affecting common beech trees, Fagus sylvatica, in Europe since before 1849. Until 1914 it was thought that the beech scale insect itself was responsible for the disease. Subsequently it was discovered that a fungus, then identified as Nectria ditissima, was in fact killing the trees infested by the scale. Around 1890 the scale insect was accidentally introduced into Nova Scotia. By 1932, the scale and its associated Nectria fungus had spread to many areas of the Maritime Provinces and parts of eastern and south central Maine. It continues to spread in North America and is now found in Quebec, Ontario, New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Attempts are being made to discover the geographic origin of beech scale in order to try to identify any natural enemies that might hold promise for its biological control. From these studies and associated ribosomal DNA analysis, it seems likely that the pest originated in the region of northeast Greece, northern Iran, the Caucasus and the Black Sea drainage basin on the host beech subspecies F. sylvatica orientalis. Description Adult scales are elliptical and about one millimetre long and are covered by a cream coloured, cottony wax secretion. They have reddish-brown eyes, no wings, rudimentary antennae and legs, and numerous minute wax-secreting glands. The stylet through which they suck sap can be up to two millimetres long. Life cycle Beech scale nymph There are no male beech scale insects and the females reproduce by parthenogenesis. From midsummer onwards, they deposit four to eight pale yellow eggs, attached to each other in strings end to end, on the bark of the trees where they have been feeding. The wingless larvae that hatch out about twenty days later are known as crawlers or nymphs. They have well-developed legs and short antennae. Some remain concealed under the female, which dies after the eggs are laid, and others disperse to cracks and crevices on the tree. A few get washed down or fall to the ground and most of these perish. Occasionally one may find its way to another beech tree, perhaps wafted there by the wind or on the foot of a bird, and founds a new colony. Having found a location on a suitable tree, the crawler forces its tubular stylet into the bark and starts to feed. At this stage, it moults and becomes a second-stage, legless nymph, and will remain sedentary for the rest of its life. It secretes wax from glands and is soon covered in a protective coating of wool-like material. After overwintering it completes a second moult in the spring to become a mature female. Biology The beech scale is monophagous, being found only on beech trees, and sucks sap from the parenchyme tissue of the bark. The small wounds produced when it feeds allow the Nectria fungi to invade infested trees. The insect colonises beech trees that are aged at least thirty years. Studies have shown that younger trees produce defensive chemicals which deter infestation. A ladybird beetle Chilocorus stigma feeds on this scale and is common throughout most of the Eastern United States, but this predator does not reduce scale populations sufficiently to control infestations. Persistent severely cold weather may kill beech scale and air temperatures of -37 ¬∞C have been shown to be lethal to insects not protected by snow. Although trees are weakened when supporting scale colonies, this does not usually cause mortality, which only occurs after the trees have been invaded by the Nectria fungi. It usually takes three to six years of infestation by the scale insect before the fungus reaches critical levels. Where beech bark disease becomes established, most of the larger trees will die. Some trees seem to be partially resistant to the disease and a small number seem to be completely resistant. This may be partly due to the fact that trees with smooth bark provide fewer cracks and crevices in which the scale insect can flourish.Forest Encyclopedia Network  References  Category:Insect vectors of plant pathogens Category:Hemiptera of North America Category:Insects described in 1936 Category:Eriococcidae ","title":"Cryptococcus fagisuga"},{"id":"30597985","text":"The Lyc√©e Pierre-Corneille (also known as the Lyc√©e Corneille) is a state secondary school located in the city of Rouen, France. Originally founded by the Jesuits in 1593, the school was secularized following the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, and is today non-religious and ruled by the French Ministry of Education. The school adopted the name of the playwright Pierre Corneille in 1873, and was classified as a national heritage site in December 1985.Ministry of Culture - list of Historic Monuments Origins Nave of the former chapel, today an auditorium.Auditorium de la Chapelle Corneille The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century led the Archbishop of Rouen, Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, to protect the influence of the Catholic Church by creating a school to educate the children of the aristocracy and bourgeoisie in accordance with the purest doctrinal principles of Roman Catholicism. The school started teaching in 1593 run by the Jesuits and known initially as the Coll√®ge de Bourbon.Lyc√©e Pierre Corneille de Rouen ‚Äì History From 1595 to 1604 teaching ceased because of Jesuit expulsions. Between 1614 and 1631 the gatehouse and chapel were built. By 1662, the lyc√©e had taught two thousand pupils. The chapel was opened in 1631 although foundation stone had been laid in 1614 by Marie de M√©dicis, the widow of King Henri IV of France. The chapel blends both late gothic and classical architectural styles in its fifty-two metre nave. It became a listed building in 1908. In 1762 the school became known as the Coll√®ge Royal after the Jesuits had been expelled from France. After the French Revolution it became associated with the 'Ecole Centrale' following the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, and reducing study of humanities in favour of a broader-based curriculum. A class at the Lyc√©e Pierre-Corneille, 1902. Artists Robert Antoine Pinchon (second row, right) and Marcel Duchamp (third row, left, out of focus). On Pinchon's right is very likely Pierre Dumont After 1803 it became known as the 'Lyc√©e Imp√©rial' and taught humanities and mathematics following the principles and discipline of the Napoleonic code. Successful students were awarded the Baccalaur√©at and subjects increased to include languages and Natural Sciences. The school then developed a two-year 'post baccalaureate' curriculum that enabled entry to the Grandes √©coles. In 1873, the Lyc√©e was renamed 'Lyc√©e Pierre-Corneille' in honour of the alumnus, the 17th century writer and academic, Pierre Corneille. At this time the petit lyc√©e was added for younger pupils. In 1890 the sports club Les Francs Joueurs was founded. Since 1918 the school has run a Norwegian 'college' that houses typically twenty-four boys for three years each. During World War I it served as a military hospital. In World War II it was commandeered by the German army, and was then bombed in September 1942 and on April 19, 1944.

This release features nods to Neil Young, Helen Reddy, Kim Fowley, Smokey Robinson, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Peter Frampton, Jonathan Richman, Lou Reed, Sweet, Chic, James Taylor and Sham 69. Despite a poor response both at home and in America it was voted Spin's 'Number 1 Album of 1991 You Didn't Hear'. Reception \\"Tough and tight like early punk, hooky like sugar pop\\" is how Joe Levy of Spin has described The Great White Wonder. He also writes that their \\"obsession with recapturing innocent thrills...keeps them on the right side of parody\\". He closes by saying the album is \\"brilliant, clever, and sarcastic, but more importantly, incredible fun.\\" Also from Spin, Regina Joseph in describing the influence of the 1970s on the album writes that the band \\"shamelessly wallow[s] in the goofiest dreck of that misbegotten era\\" and closes by writing that the album's \\"triumph lies in creating cool parody while keeping it as innocent as child's play.\\" Jason Ankeny of Allmusic writes that the band \\"rape, plunder and pillage the history of pop music with manic glee\\" in reference to their use of old source material, and concludes that they are \\"in love with pop music\\" and the album is \\"their valentine to rock & roll.\\" In his New York Times review of the album, Milo Miles calls the band \\"a potent, ingenious rock-and-roll band\\" and comments on the album's \\"bright vocal harmonies and guitar-pumped melodies of mid-60's pop\\".

It grows to a carapace width of on Ascension Island, where it is the largest native land animal. It exists in two distinct colour morphs, one yellow and one purple, with few intermediates. The yellow morph dominates on Ascension Island, while the purple morph is more frequent on Rocas Atoll. The species differs from other Johngarthia species by the form of the third maxilliped. Johngarthia lagostoma lives in burrows among vegetation, at altitudes of up to , emerging at night to feed on plant matter and occasionally on animals. From January to March there is an annual migration to the sea to release the planktonic larvae. The species was first described (as Gecarcinus lagostoma) by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837 from material sent to him by the naturalists Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, collected by the French ship Astrolabe. Distribution and biogeography Johngarthia lagostoma is found on Ascension Island, Trindade Island, Fernando de Noronha and the Rocas Atoll. On Ascension Island, J. lagostoma is restricted outside the breeding season to the slopes of Green Mountain, where there is sufficient moisture and vegetation, the rest of the island being too arid for the crab to survive. All the land above is suitable habitat for the crabs, as is much of the land above . They are occasionally found at lower altitudes, including the well-watered gardens of Georgetown, and the sooty tern breeding colony in the south-west of the island (known as the Wideawake Fairs). On Trindade Island, J. lagostoma is abundant wherever plants grow, included the highest parts of the island. The geographic distribution of J. lagostoma across a small number of islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean is very unusual, and difficult to explain by planktonic dispersal. Its nearest relatives are the other species of Johngarthia, two of which (J. malpilensis and J. planata) inhabit islands in the Pacific Ocean off Central America, and one (J. weileri) is found on islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Some authors have suggested the existence of former islands, now submerged, which could have acted as \\"stepping stones\\" for the colonisation of Ascension Island; the isolation of Ascension Island from any other land mass makes transportation of either larvae or adults difficult. Description Purple morph of J. lagostoma on Green Mountain, Ascension Island Mature specimens of J. lagostoma are typically wide across the carapace on Ascension Island; individuals from the Rocas Atoll are somewhat smaller. In the family Gecarcinidae, species are normally separated by the form of the first pleopod (gonopod), which is used by males during mating, but there is no difference in the gonopod between J. lagostoma and J. planata. Instead, J. lagostoma differs from other species in the genus by the form of the third maxilliped; it has a fissure which is a narrow slit, but which gapes open in other species. The third maxilliped is also larger, covering the epistome and the antennules in J. lagostoma but not in other species. Within the species, two distinct colour morphs can be seen. The \\"yellow\\" morph has a bright yellow or orange exoskeleton, with white patches on the underside of the walking legs and claws. The \\"purple\\" morph has a dark purple exoskeleton, but with the same white patches as on the yellow morph. A few intermediate individuals occur, which are predominantly yellow, but with purple patches on the carapace. On Ascension Island, the yellow morph is the more frequent one, while on the Rocas Atoll, the distribution is more equal. Darker individuals are thought to be better concealed from predators, but more prone to heat stress during long migrations; The Rocas Atoll is much smaller than Ascension Island, and the migration routes are therefore shorter, which may explain the difference in frequency of the two morphs. Ecology and conservation Before Ascension Island was colonised by Europeans in the 19th century, Johngarthia lagostoma was the only large land animal on the island. Since then, many species of mammal have been introduced to Ascension Island, and now compete with J. lagostoma; they include mice, rats and rabbits. J. lagostoma is active at night and after rain, when it emerges from its burrows, which can be up to deep. In 1915, H. A. Baylis reported that it feeds on \\"decaying vegetation and perhaps a certain amount of excreta from sea-birds\\"; Cited in Manning & Chace (1990). most of its diet is thought to be made up of plant matter, but can also include animals. In the Wideawake Fairs, J. lagostoma feeds on chicks and eggs of the sooty tern, and they have been proposed as a limiting factor in the breeding of petrels on Ascension Island. In May, green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) hatch, and J. lagostoma is one of several predators to target the emerging hatchlings, alongside the Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila) and feral cats. The crabs find water on and under rocks, especially after condensation has begun to form on their cool surfaces at night. In the late nineteenth century, a bounty was levied on J. lagostoma in order to reduce its numbers. Hunters were paid 6 pence (alternatively paid in rum) for every hundred claws collected. In 1879, the total bag for the island comprised 66 cats, 4,013 mice, 7,683 rats and 80,414 land crabs; in the eight years to 1887, bounties were collected on more than 330,000 crabs. Cited in Manning & Chace (1990). The current population is much smaller, and the low level of recruitment and lack of juveniles suggests that the species may become endangered. Life cycle Although juvenile and adult J. lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to migrate to the sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In most members of the family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J. lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May. The crabs travel approximately per day, and mating can take place anywhere along the route. The proportion of males on the migration therefore decreases as the migration continues. The eggs are larger than in other gecarcinid species and consequently fewer in number; females with a carapace width of had a mean fecundity of 72,000. Spawning occurs in the last quarter of the lunar cycle, during neap tides, on rocky shores. Taxonomy and history Johngarthia lagostoma was first described by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837, under the name Gecarcinus lagostoma. The specific epithet ' means \\"hare-lip\\", from the Greek (', \\"hare\\") and (', \\"mouth\\"); Milne-Edwards also named the species in French ' (\\"hare-lipped land crab\\"). Milne-Edwards erroneously gave the type locality as \\"\\" (Australasia); he had been given the material he used for the description by Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, who were working on the molluscs collected on the Astrolabe excursion, which had visited Australasia and stopped at Ascension Island in 1829. G. lagostoma was placed in the subgenus Johngarthia by Michael T√ºrkay in 1970, who raised the subgenus to the rank of genus in 1987. Many subsequent voyages halted at Ascension Island, and many visitors commented on the land crabs they found there, including William Dampier, Charles Darwin and Charles Wyville Thomson. Bernard Stonehouse reported on an expedition by the British Ornithologists' Union to Ascension Island, stating: Cited in Manning & Chace (1990). > We met land crabs, too, and were sadly disappointed. They were small, no > larger than an ordinary edible crab, with bloated shells and moderately long > pincers. Some were of beetroot purple, others yellow or orange, apparently > two colour-phases of the same species. They were shy, freezing with pincers > erect when alarmed, usually to be found within a short distance of their > burrows and ready to scuttle down at the drop of a hat. In rainy weather > they promenaded more freely, sometimes appearing at the side of road with > arms waving like diminutive but aggressive hitch-hikers. Fringed mandibles > [third maxillipeds] suggest a permanently turned-down mouth, giving them a > disgruntled, unhappy expression; they were disagreeable rather than sinister > and fell far short of their reputation. The first land crab I met was > sitting in a prickly pear bush, sadly munching one of the brilliant red > fruits and dribbling juice. I could never take them seriously after that. The closely related crabs from the islands of the Gulf of Guinea were formerly included in Gecarcinus lagostoma, but are now treated as a separate species, Johngarthia weileri.

This is in contrast to synonymy lists, in which a taxonomist may express remarks on the work of others. Commonly such remarks take the form of abbreviated taxonomic expressions in biological classification. Usage of open nomenclature There are no strict conventions in open nomenclature concerning which expressions to use or where to place them in the Latin name of a species or other taxon, and this may lead to difficulties of interpretation. However, the most significant unsettled issues concern the way that their meanings are to be interpreted. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) makes no reference to open nomenclature, leaving its use and meaning open for interpretation by taxonomists. The following are examples of commonly used shorthand in open nomenclature: *Sp. (pl. spp.; short for \\"species\\") indicates potentially new species without remarking on its possible affinity. This suggests either that identification has not yet been completed or that currently available evidence and material are insufficient to allocate the specimens to relevant known taxa, or alternatively, that as yet the specimen cannot be assigned to a new taxon of its own with sufficient confidence. *Sp. aff. or aff. (short for ) indicates a potentially new and undescribed species has an affinity to, but is not identical to, the named species. *V. (short for the , meaning \\"we have seen\\") means that the author inspected the original type specimens and are basing their statements on first-hand experience. Sometimes the opposite is expressed as \\"non v.\\" ('), meaning that the original has never been observed, as is the case with many kinds of fungal spore, for instance. *Cf. (short for the , \\"compare with\\") or a question mark (?) signify varying degrees or types of uncertainty and may be used differently depending on the author. In more recent usage, \\"cf.\\" indicates greater uncertainty than a question mark.

Background and Career Trent was born in the village of Zvipani in Karoi District, Mashonaland West Province. She was not allowed to go to her local school, Matau Primary School, as a child due to poverty as well as being female, although her brother Tinashe, an indifferent student, was given the opportunity to attend. She later recalled the men in the village including her father \\"pointing to the boys in the village and saying 'These are the breadwinners of tomorrow. We need to educate them. We need to send them to school. The girls will get married.'\\" She taught herself to read and write from her brother's books, and eventually started doing her brother's homework. When her teacher discovered this (because the homework was done so much better than the work her brother did at school) he begged Trent's father to allow her to attend school. She then attended school for a short period, but her father accepted a brideprice of a cow and married her off young. She had three children by age 18 and without a high school diploma. Her husband beat her for wanting an education. In 1991, Jo Luck from Heifer International visited her village and asked every woman about her greatest dream. Trent said she wanted to go to America and get a bachelor's degree, a master's, and eventually a PhD. Encouraged by her mother, Trent wrote down these dreams, put the paper in a scrap of tin, and buried it. In 1998, she moved to Oklahoma with her husband and their five children. Three years later, she earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural education. In 2003 Trent earned her master's degree, and her husband was deported for abuse. She has since remarried, to Mark Trent, a plant pathologist whom she met at Oklahoma State University. After she earned each degree, she returned to Zimbabwe, unearthed her tin and checked off each goal she accomplished, one by one. In December 2009, she earned her doctorate from Western Michigan University; her thesis looked at HIV/AIDS prevention programs for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa. Her life story was featured in the 2009 book Half the Sky by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, and in an excerpt of that book published by The New York Times Magazine. Subsequently, Oprah Winfrey ran a segment on Tererai in the Oprah episode concerning the book Half the Sky. Oprah sent a crew with Trent back to Zimbabwe to dig up the piece of tin in which she had buried the paper with her goals. Since earning her PhD in 2009, Trent obtained a two-year commitment to work with Heifer International (which paid for her PhD). Also in 2009, she founded the Tinogona Foundation, later renamed Tererai Trent International, which has built several schools in Zimbabwe. In 2013, she received Masters in Public Health (Epidemiology) from University of California, Berkeley from University of California, Berkeley. In May 2011, Oprah Winfrey revealed that Trent was her all-time favorite guest, and donated $1.5 million so Trent could build her own school in her old village in Zimbabwe. The school was completed in 2014. In 2015, Trent published a children's book about her own life called The Girl who Buried her Dreams in a Can, illustrated by Jan Spivey Gilchrist. Her 2017 self-help book, The Awakened Woman: Remembering & Igniting Our Sacred Dreams, with a foreword by Oprah Winfrey, was named the Outstanding Literary Work, Instructional at the 49th NAACP Image Awards. She has been an adjunct professor in Monitoring & Evaluation in Global Health at Drexel University since 2013.

The business was founded in 1923 by V.E. Freestone and A.J. Webb as a specialist coachbuilding service in workshops (Unity Works) in Brentfield Road, Stonebridge Park, Willesden, North London, where it remained for its entire life. Freestone had learnt his trade working at Crossley Motors, Webb had returned to England having trained in France. While working on bespoke Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars they developed the style known as Top hat, and popularised the Razor Edge style. Delivering up to 15 cars per annum they showed their cars at the London Motor Show and won the Gold Medal in the private coachbuilders competition nine years in a row. Converted to aircraft components like many coachbuilders during the Second World War they made highly detailed and intricate wing tips for the Supermarine Spitfire. After the Second World War Rolls-Royce offered a complete steel-bodied car, the Bentley Mark VI from 1946 and later the Rolls- Royce Silver Wraith.

Freestone & Webb continued to refurbish and build bodies until 1958 when it became a pure showroom brand.

They recorded one album with this line-up, before becoming a two-piece and subsequently recorded two more albums, before splitting in 2001. Origins Formed in 1993 with a fifth member, Phil Doyle on guitar, the band began performing regularly around Dublin, and recorded their first demo The Eternal Procession at Heartbeat Studios in Dublin, on audio cassette. Doyle subsequently left, but the cassette attracted the attention of record company Grave News, who asked them for a track for the compilation album Dreams in the Witch House. The track, \\"Communion with Sophia\\", led to an album deal with the label. The subsequent album, To Bestial Gods..., was recorded during 1995 at Sonic Studios, Dublin, with guest vocalist Tanya Doyle. Move to London In the summer of 1996 the band relocated to London, but two of the original line- up, Cowley and Fallon, decided to remain in Dublin due to personal commitments. The remaining two members continued to write songs, some of which turned up on various compilation albums. Working on the new album, working title Exiles, the band enlisted the vocals of Julianne Regan, of All About Eve, on some of the tracks. The album, recorded in 1998 at Substate Belgravia Studios, London, came out in 1999 with the title Descent. In 2000, the band released their final album Resolution, recorded at The Hermitage and Shelter Studios, London. The album contained new songs as well as remixes and alternative versions of previous tracks. In 2001 the band split up, with Egan returning to Dublin and Carey remaining in London.

By his own account it produced over 420 million liters in 2010 whereby more than 80% of the total volume was exported in over 80 countries around the world. Headquartered in Lauterach in Vorarlberg the main markets supplied are Germany, Italy, Austria, Romania and the Czech Republic. According to company- related reports, Pfanner is the leader in the German ice tea market with a share of 19.8 percent.  History  In 1856 Max Hermann Pfanner bought the restaurant \\"Gasthof Hirschen\\" in Lauterach and founded a small in-house brewery. In 1919 his grandson Hermann Pfanner took over operations and expanded the business in the following years by selling various agricultural products as well as wines and spirits. By 1933 fruit juice was produced for the first time. After Hermann Pfanner died, his wife Ferdinanda and their children continued the business. Due to thoughtful business practices and technical innovations they were able to pass on the company to the next generation (Hedwig, Hans, Erwin and Egon Pfanner). This generation was able to expand the fruit juice business internationally successfully. By 1984 these efforts were rewarded by the Austrian government with the coat of arms of Austria. In 1988 the Hermann Pfanner Getr√§nke GmbH was founded and handed over to the succeeding Generation. In 2001 fruit Juice production in Hamburg was started to improve the supply for the growing German market. Currently Pfanner is still a family-run Business, managed by the families Pfanner, Schneider and Dietrich.  Products  Pfanner produces about 210 different products, whereby fruit juices make up the most known articles. In addition ice teas, lemonades and further soft drinks are produced. Apart from filling juices for the Pfanner brand, the company also offers contract bottling services.  Pfanner and Fairtrade  Pfanner started a cooperation with Fairtrade in 2001. Today Pfanner is the biggest Fairtrade-partner in the sector of fruit juices worldwide and offers the widest range of fair-traded products according to company-related reports.  Production sites  Pfanner operates factories in Austria, Germany, Italy and the Ukraine. The headquarter is located in Lauterach, the biggest production site in Enns (Upper Austria). Further sites are in Hamburg (Germany), Policoro (Italy) and in Bar (Ukraine).

These tests followed the Operation Wigwam series and preceded the Operation Redwing series.  Introduction  These experiments were safety tests, the purpose of which were to determine whether a weapon or warhead damaged in an accident would detonate with a nuclear yield, even if some or all of the high explosive components burned or detonated.National Nuclear Security Administration / Nevada Site Office, Plutonium Dispersal Tests at the Nevada Test Site, April 2010, DOE/NV-1046 The procedure for these tests was to fault the test bomb by removing a detonator wire, or perhaps all but one, for example, possibly enhancing the weapon with extra initiators or an especially enriched core, and then to fire the weapon normally (see Warhead design safety). If there is any nuclear yield in the firing, then the test is deemed a failure from a safety standpoint. A successful test will measure only the chemical explosive in the test bomb exploding, which still, of course, blasts the bomb core and causes the core material to be spread over a wide area if the test is in open air, as all the Project 56 tests were.  Aftermath  Over of Area 11 at the NTS were contaminated with plutonium dust and fragments. The area has become known as Plutonium Valley, and continues to be used on an intermittent basis for realistic drills in radiological monitoring and sampling operations. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + United States' Project 56 series tests and detonations - !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Name The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions - Soviet peaceful explosions were named).

These tests followed the Operation Plumbbob series and preceded the Operation Hardtack I series. All the tests in Project 58 were one-point safety tests. They were intended to freeze device designs prior to full-scale tests at Operation Hardtack I. No significant yield was expected from either, but the second, Coulomb-C, a surface test conducted on December 9, produced an unanticipated yield of 500 tons. Shortly after detonation, fallout readings of fifty roentgens per hour were recorded on the Mercury Highway, and, as the cloud moved toward the southwest, personnel at Jackass Flats involved in construction for future nuclear rocket testing were forced to take cover. Eventually, the cloud reached the Los Angeles area where readings caused public concern.U.S. Department of Energy, Battlefield of the Cold War, The Nevada Test Site, Volume 1, Atmospheric Nuclear Weapons Testing, 1951-1963, DOE/MA-0003 { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + United States' Project 58+58A series tests and detonations - !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Name The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions - Soviet peaceful explosions were named).

Founded in 1960, the school is based on the values and spirit of Mary MacKillop. It was established under the auspices of the Sisters of St Joseph. The current principal is Narelle Archer and the assistant principal being Melinda Melham. Mount Saint Joseph's brother school is De La Salle Revesby Heights.  History  In 1959 Father Landers (Panania) and Father Carr (Revesby) accompanied Mother Leone Ryan, the Superior of the Sisters of St Joseph, in search of a suitable site for a new girls‚Äô high school in western Sydney. At this time the population of the area was increasing rapidly and the parishes were unable to meet the costs of building such a school. The search ended with the purchase of the land on which the school now stands. The land was classified as Green Belt, so permission had to be sought and duly granted from the councils concerned. A school was built and in 1960, girls from the surrounding parish schools began their secondary education at Milperra. After that, the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph provided the necessary support for the ongoing development of the school. On 20 April 1989, the Mount St Joseph School Board was instituted following the incorporation of the school as Mount Saint Joseph Milperra Ltd. In 2013, the congregation handed over administration of the school to Sydney Catholic Schools. Mount St Joseph retains its links to the Josephite community through annual feast days and celebrations, connections to other Josephite schools in Warmun (Western Australia) and Tarma (Peru), and participation in social justice and leadership initiatives alongside the Sisters of St Joseph.  Academics  MSJ offers a range of curriculum choices ranging from ATAR level HSC courses, through to VET courses supported by the National Training Framework. The students perform well in the HSC, especially when compared with students in the region and across the state. In 2016 the school was ranked 126th in the state in the Sydney Morning Herald's HSC Rankings.

Extent and language  The Tyrolean Unterland should not be confused with the Tyrolean Lower Inn Valley (Tiroler Unterinntal) which is in the same region but only describes the Inn valley, nor with the South Tyrolean Unterland (S√ºdtiroler Unterland). Besides the Unterland there is also the Tyrolean Oberland, which lies west of Innsbruck. Innsbruck itself is usually considered to be part of the Lower Inn valley, but is usually mentioned separately. The middle Inn valley around Innsbruck is therefore often referred to as the Tyrolean Mittelland (Tiroler Mittelland). A further distinction can be made based on linguistic criteria. The linguistic shade using the \\"sch\\" sound - e.g. Tirol isch lei oans - is exhibited especially in dialects west of the Zillertal. On that basis, the Tyrolese living actually in the Lower Inn valley are not strictly in the Tyrolean Unterland, because the differ from them through this South Austro-Bavarian \\"sch\\" from the Bavarian dialects that are found east of the Zillertal. In the districts of Kufstein and Kitzb√ºhel a Central Austro-Bavarian dialect tends to prevail over the South Austro- Bavarian version. For example a person from Schwaz naturally feels himself to be a Tyrolese, more precisely an Unterinntaler from the Lower Inn valley ‚Äì but in no circumstances considers himself to be an Unterlandler. If a native from Schwaz drives to Kufstein, he is from his point of view \\"in the Unterland\\", whilst he himself lives between Innsbruck and the Unterland, but not actually in the Unterland, although according to the geographical definition that is self-evidently the case.

The railway is in total length, and runs entirely in desert regions. The line was built with investments of ¬•4.27 billion. It opened to freight operations in December 2009 and passenger service in November 2010, but has been plagued by sandstorms and shifting dunes, which have buried tracks and disrupted service. Route In the east, the Linhe‚ÄìCeke railway branches off the Baotou‚ÄìLanzhou railway at Linhe, on the Yellow River, and it runs due west through Hanggin Rear Banner, Tukemumiao, Suhongtu and Ejin to Ceke, where the line meets the Jiayuguan‚ÄìCeke railway. The Lince railway crosses the Ulanbuhe, Yamaleike, and the Badain Jaran Deserts, and over of track is laid in desert or Gobi terrain. Over 90% of the line lies in areas with no highway access. Of the line's 18 stations, 13 have no running water. The line has 180 bridges and 1,000 tunnels and underpasses, including passage ways for Mongolian gazelle in the of wilderness from Wuliji to Ejin. The Ceke railway is designed to serve as part of a longer rail corridor between North China and Xinjiang, and to carry coal produced from the Nariin Sukhait mining complex (Ovoot Tolgoi) in southern Mongolia near Ceke. In the first year of operation, the line carried 390,000 tons of coal, and also delivered 3,000 tons of water, 15,000 barrels of drinking water and 20,000 kg of food to stations and remote communities along route. Operational history and problems Since the railway opened in December 2009, service has been adversely affected by sand storms and shifting dunes, which affects of track. Sand storms occur in the region on as many as 230 days per year, with sustained gusts reaching Level 11 on the Beaufort Scale. In the first year of operations, over 10,000 workers were mobilized and ¬•71 million was spent to clear track, spread sand-control netting, build sand-restraint devices, and plant trees. Nine sand control centers were established along route. Service was suspended for two months in the spring of 2010, and when freight service was restored in July, traffic was reduced from eight pairs of trains per day to two pairs. In the first 36 days after passenger service was introduced in November 2010, sand storms buried track on 27 days and caused 51 service disruptions. Sand storms have reduced effective speed on eight sections of track between Suhongtu to Swan Lake to . When passenger service began in November 2010, a journey from Hohhot to Ejin took 14 hours and 55 minutes. As of October 2012, schedule systems showed one daily train between these points, with similar travel times. The schedule shows no stops between the Linhe Station and Ejin, presumably because no one lives there. In 2011 and 2012, the line carried, respectively, 1.39 and 1.1 million metric tons of coal.

He is best known as one of the chief founding team members, together with Frederick Rentschler, of Pratt & Whitney Aircraft. Mead and Rentschler left Wright Aeronautical with the plan to start their own aviation-related business; they founded Pratt & Whitney Aircraft in July 1925.. Their first project was to build a new, large, air-cooled, radial aircraft engine of Mead's design, which soon came to be named the Wasp. The first Wasp model was the R-1340, and a large series of Wasp models and Hornet models followed. Mead, as Vice President of Engineering, was the head of engineering for Pratt & Whitney from 1925 to 1935. He later left Pratt & Whitney and its parent United Aircraft. He served as the president of the U.S. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA),. and he served as head of the aeronautical section of the National Defense Advisory Commission during World War II, as a manager in the U.S. government's war materiel production effort.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, p. 81, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. . Early life Mead was born in Everett, Massachusetts on December 27, 1891, to Dr. George Nathaniel Plumer Mead and Jennie Henrietta Mathilda LeMann Mead.. He graduated from the Choate School in Wallingford, CT in 1911 and attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but left in 1915 without graduating, owing to health problems.. Career Mead worked for well over a year at Sterling Engine Company of Buffalo, NY. His next job was with the Crane-Simplex company of New Brunswick, NJ, builders of the Simplex automobile. Crane-Simplex later merged with the Wright-Martin Aeronautical Corporation where Mead was in charge of the experimental division of the engineering department.. In 1919 he became chief engineer of what was now the Wright Aeronautical Corporation upon the resignation of Henry Crane. In late 1924, internal disagreements at Wright resulted in the resignation of President Frederick Rentschler. In 1925, Rentschler obtained financing to start Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Corporation in the existing factory of the Pratt & Whitney Tool Company in Hartford, Connecticut, and Mead left Wright Aeronautical to join Rentschler as the Vice President of Engineering.http://www.enginehistory.org/pratt_&_whitney.htm At Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, Mead led the development program for their first engine, completed on Christmas Eve, 1925. The 425 hp (317 kW) R-1340 Wasp easily passed its official qualification test in March 1926, and the Navy ordered 200 engines. The speed, climb, performance, and reliability that the engine offered revolutionized American aviation. Subsequently, he led the development programs of the more powerful R-1690 Hornet and several other series of air- cooled radial aircraft engines. In 1929, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was merged with a number of other aviation-related corporations, including Boeing, Sikorsky, and Vought, as part of the new United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UATC). Pratt & Whitney became a subsidiary. In 1930, Rentschler made a difficult decision about which engines to use for the Boeing 247. Mead insisted on the larger, more powerful Hornets; the pilots of United Airlines insisted on the less powerful Wasps. Fernandez says,. \\"When Rentschler stood by the pilots, Mead took the decision personally. [‚Ä¶] He agreed to try to develop a Wasp [capable] of powering the smaller version of his transport plane, but he never forgot the insult. He knew he was right, and within a year so did the rest of the United States.\\" In 1934, the Air Mail scandal led to the breakup of UATC. Pratt & Whitney, along with UATC's other manufacturing interests east of the Mississippi River, became United Aircraft, with Rentschler as president. Rentschler decided to turn over the presidency of Pratt & Whitney to a subordinate as he concentrated on leading the parent corporation. Mead and Donald Brown were his two choices for his successor, but Mead did not want the job, and he refused to cooperate with Brown, who became the new president.. Brown appointed Leonard S. Hobbs as engineering manager for Pratt & Whitney, and Mead stayed on as an engineer reporting to Hobbs. It was not so much a demotion as a growing of distance and independence from United Aircraft. Mead was still a person of high authority at United Aircraft, but something like an officer who resigns his commission. He began to act something like a consultant or engineer emeritus, setting up a design office in his home and not coming to the headquarters as often. By 1939, Mead's policy disagreements with Rentschler had become so great that he declined reelection to United Aircraft's board of directors. In October 1939, he became president of the U.S. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). In May 1940, he was named head of the aeronautical section of the National Defense Advisory Commission by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A military buildup was underway. The Lend-Lease program was still 18 months from being created, and the U.S. did not yet have any certainty of being a combatant in the new war that had erupted, but the program to build up materiel to send to Britain and France, and to augment the U.S.'s own armed forces, had begun. Roosevelt, acting on William S. Knudsen's recommendation, had appointed Mead to help coordinate aircraft production.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 81, 94, 104, 159, 219, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. . Mead sold his United Aircraft stock to avoid conflict of interest in his new government procurement position. He was now completely severed from his long tenure at United Aircraft and its predecessors. Fernandez describes the war years that followed as Knudsen and Mead, now materiel production czars for the U.S. government, interacted with Rentschler and Eugene Wilson of United.. United, which lacked plant capacity to satiate the demand, licensed manufacturing of many of its designs to the automakers in Detroit. Awards In January 1940, Mead received the Reed award for outstanding achievement in aviation. In 1946, Mead was presented the Medal for Merit for his efforts in the development and production of aircraft engines used in World War II.

Shortly after the end of World War I, Farman introduced a low powered single seat monoplane for sport and tourism. It flew for the first time in May 1919 and was named the Moustique (in English, Mosquito). A little later, aircraft of this kind became known in the United Kingdom as motor gliders, the subjects of the first Lympne Trials of 1923. In 1922 one Aviette, without its engine, had already won prizes at a national glider competition. Three months before the Lympne Trials several Aviettes competed in an equivalent French meeting for moto- aviettes at Buc. The design was revived, over 17 years after its first appearance, as the F 450 Moustique and was one of the aircraft purchased by the French government as part of l'Aviation Populaire programme. Design and development The original Moustique, later known as the Moustique I, was a shoulder wing monoplane. The wing was rectangular in plan, fabric covered and was wired braced from above and below. The upper wires were attached to a king post protruding from the raised, curved decking ahead of the cockpit and lower wires went to the undercarriage structure. The wings carried full span ailerons. Behind the cockpit the fuselage, which reached up only to the pilot's waist, was slender. It was square sectioned and covered with thin plywood. The parallel chord horizontal tail had separate elevators with the deep rudder moving between them. These surfaces were fabric covered and the rudder was round topped; there was no fixed fin. The undercarriage consisted of two parallel spruce panels mounted on the fuselage, bearing two mainwheels on a single axle. This first aircraft was powered by a flat twin ABC Scorpion engine. The first Moustique flew in May 1919, but by the following year its span had been reduced from 7.65 m to 5.0 m (from 25 ft 1 in to 16 ft 5 in), saving a little weight, and was known as the HF 206 or the HF206 Moustique I. No other Moustique had so short a span. In 1922 a glider version called the Aviette had flown. This had an extended span of and an unladen weight of only 43 kg. It also had a deeper fuselage, allowing the pilot to sit with his head just clear of the upper surface, and a new upper wing bracing system with the bracing wires attached to the top of a tall, three post pylon, just in front of the pilot. It also had a reshaped rudder with a linear, rising top. It was the only Moustique type glider, but the fuselage, wing bracing and rudder modifications were carried forward into all later variants. In 1923 three powered Aviettes were entered for the competition at Buc, Yvelines. All had an engines but one aircraft had a 3-cylinder radial Salmson 3 Ad and the other two, 4-cylinder inline Sergant As. The Moustique II or F 21 of 1924 was powered by a 3-cylinder Anzani 3 A2 radial and had a wing with a span of , fitted with short span ailerons. Two took part in the 1924 Tour de France. In the mid-1930s there was a government-driven revival of interest in low cost flying with the introduction of the Aviation Populaire programme. In response, Farman relaunched the Moustique with a slightly shorter span of and a longer fuselage. It first flew in December 1935. The first five prototypes were designated F 450 Moustique. The first was initially powered by a Poinsard 2 Ca flat twin engine; later it, like the others had Mengin engines of the same type and power. A visual difference between this and earlier Moustiques was the presence of a normal fin, carrying a round-topped rudder. The production version, the F 451 Moustique, had a AVA 4A-00 flat-four two-stroke. This variant was produced in much greater numbers (46) than any other Moustique. The last Moustique development was the two seat F 455 Super Moustique, initially called the Moustique III, which first flew in 1936. Its span was increased by and it had a more powerful Mengin 2 A-01 engine. Only one was built; its performance in the climb was poor, but in any case the light aircraft section of the Farman works was shut down when the company was nationalised in March 1937. Operational history During the early 1920s Farman entered Moustiques into several competitions. In August 1922 the first national French glider meeting, the Congrƒós exp√©rimental d'aviation sans moteur, organised by the Association of French Flyers (AFF) and partly government-funded, was held in Combegrasse, Puy-de-D√¥me. Farman entered two aircraft, the Aviette glider and a biplane (a de-motorised Farman FF 65); overall there were 17 contestants. The Aviette, piloted by Lois Bossoutrot, won several prizes in the competition between catapult-launched gliders, achieving the lowest sinking speed, the greatest altitude (80 m or 262 ft) and longest over-launch site duration of 3 min 30 s. The Aviette was placed second in the distance-covered contest, flying . Over the fortnight-long event, the Aviette was in the air for 48 min 25 s. In July 1923, three powered Aviettes competed at Buc, Yvelines for the Grand Prix de Motoaviette against eighteen other entrants. The competition was open to all aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight of less than 250 kg (551 pounds). There was a 125,000 FF prize for the fastest flight of 30 laps around a 10-kilometer (6.21-mile) course. The winner was Lucien Coupet in the Salmson-powered Aviette, covering 310 kilometers (192.5 miles) in 4 hours 37 minutes 19 seconds. No other aircraft could overcome the wind and rain. A year later, Farman entered two MF 21 Moustique IIs into the Tour de France, an eight-stage contest organised by the AFF. Initial elimination trials in bad weather reduced the 15 entrants to a starting group of three for the Tour proper. The MF 21 flown by Maurice Drouhin was the only survivor by the end of the second stage, and he was declared the winner, having covered in 20 hr 40 min 27 s. Drouhin also won the Prix Solex, worth 50,000 FF in April 1925, flying the Salmson-powered Aviette. This required a flight from Paris to Rouen (about ) using less than of petrol and oil. In 1938 the first F 450 was used to test-fly a device called a gouvernes autopt√®res, invented by Marcel Granoli. Its purpose was to provide automatic lateral and longitudinal stability in the event of a momentary sideslip. The test showed only limited success. Thirty-six of the 46 production F 451 Moustiques were bought by the state under their Aviation Populaire programme, intended to bring people from all walks of life into aviation and make pilots of them. Other F 451s were bought by individuals, partly attracted by the low costs: the aircraft sold at just under 20,000 FF. To make the Moustique attractive to the hunting fraternity, Farman advertised an optional rear locker \\"for the transport of a dog.\\" Variants ;Moustique :Later Moustique I, one only. span. ;HF 206 :The original Moustique with wings cropped to a span. ;Aviette :4 built with Salmson or Sergant engines. span.

In the 1970s he was a member of the London Film-Makers' Co-op (now LUX film distributors), and co-founder of the Digital Media Studio (now Slade Centre for Electronic Media in Fine Art) at the Slade School of Fine Arts, UCL, London. He is considered one of the pioneers of expanded cinema and moving image installation and was one of the first artists to exhibit film installations at the Tate and Hayward galleries London. His expanded cinema works and installations have since continued to break new conceptual ground and attract critical attention. A. L. Reece, in British Film Institute's A History of Experimental Film and Video, wrote: \\"Twenty-five years ago, when he made his first projections for large spaces, film and art rarely met in the gallery; now it is common and installation art is a distinct practice.\\"A. L. Reece, A History of Experimental Film and Video, British Film Institute, 1999. Life Welsby was born in Exeter, UK. He is a graduate of the Chelsea College of Art and Design (BA (Fine Art)), where he trained as a painter from 1969 until 1973, and of the Slade School of Fine Art, University of London, where he encountered the ideas of Gregory Bateson and British cyberneticists, including Stafford Beer, Ross Ashby and Gordon Pask. Andrew Pickering's summary of the nature of this technical field indicates why it also of interest artists: \\"Second-order cybernetics ... seeks to recognize that the scientific observer is part of the system to be studied, and this in turn leads to a recognition that the observer is situated and sees the world from a certain perspective, rather than achieving a detached and omniscient 'view from nowhere'\\".Andrew Pickering, The Cybernetic Brain: Sketches of Another Future Welsby completed post-graduate studies at the Slade School in 1975 and joined the faculty in 1976, where he taught in all areas of art practice and was particularly responsible for Film and Video production and, together with Chris Brisco, Juian O'Sullivan, Tim Head, Stuart Brisley, Liz Rhodes and Susan Hiller, was a co-founder of the Slade's Electronic Media Studio. In 1972 he made his first films, Wind Vane and River Yar, and became a member of the London Film Maker's Co-op, where he encountered UK based Structural Materialist film theory of Peter Gidal and the expanded cinema performances of the Cinema Action Group. (Malcolm Le Grice, Jill Etherly, William Raban, Maralyn Halford and Annabel Nicholson* Since then, he has made twenty four films which have been screened at festivals, cinematheques and art galleries worldwide, and in more than 25 gallery installations and site- specific works. In 1989, Welsby moved to Canada to take the position of Professor of Film and Digital Media at the School for the Contemporary Arts at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. Welsby is also a member of ICICS (Institute for Computing, Information, and Cognitive Systems) at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver Canada. He retired from his full- time Academic duties in 2012 and now holds the position of [Professor Emeritus] at Simon Fraser University‚Äôs Faculty of Arts Science and Communication. Welsby continues to travel widely, giving lecture presentations and exhibiting his films, videos and gallery installations. He lives on a small island on the Pacific Coast of Western Canada.  Work  Working across a range of media, film, video and digital media and gallery Installations, Welsby‚Äôs work has been mainly concerned with the problematic relationship between humans, human technology and the natural world. In Millennium Film Journal (1987), Peter Wollen wrote: \\"Welsby's work makes it possible to envisage a different kind of relationship between science and art, in which observation is separated from surveillance, and technology from domination.\\"\\"Landscape, Meteorology, and Chris Welsby\\" by Peter Wollen. Millennium Film Workshop (20th Anniversary Issue, Fall/Winter 1986‚Äì1987, Nos. 16/17/18); pp. 208‚Äì211. New York. He spent twenty years exploring ways to make films and gallery installations in which natural forces such as wind, tide, cloud cover and the rotation of the planet share creative control. In many of his films, the camera angles or framing are determined by the movement of the sun, wind or tides. In Seven Days (1974), for example, the motion of the camera, which is mounted on a motorized camera stand, followed the rotation of the earth while the in-camera editing responded to cloud cover governed by North Atlantic weather systems. In Chicago Film Reader (2001), Fred Camper observed: \\"In the 20-minute Seven Days (1974) Welsby finds his mature voice, offering a tour de force unlike anything cinema had yet seen.\\" In 1993, after he had moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Welsby abandoned film and began making digital video installations such as At Sea, Waterfall and Lost Lake. Ian Christie (Professor of Film and Media History, Birkbeck, University of London), in Sight and Sound Magazine (2007) wrote: \\"Two recent installations by veteran English landscape filmmaker, Welsby (now based in Canada), showed how digital images can realise the ambitions once vested in 16mm to near- sublime perfection. Lost Lake #2 (2005) shows a shimmering virtual lake and the four-screen At Sea plays with our sense of the 'unchanging sea' by subtly shifting markers as the waves roll in.\\"Ian Christie, Sight and Sound Magazine London, Best Films of the year 2007 # 5. Systems of Nature (Chris Welsby, Letherby Gallery, London UK) Between 2004 and 2014 he worked with Vancouver- based artist and software programmer, Brady Marks, to create a number of projects which used custom software to power real-time, weather-driven, gallery installations that used weather data to edit and mix image and sound in real time. For example, In Tree Studies (exhibited at Gwangju Biennale, South Korea 2006), multiple viewpoints of a tree and a multi-channel sound track were edited together by weather data relayed, via the internet, from weather stations around the world. In 2007, Welsby, working again with Brady Marks, began to develop imaging software that generates a hybrid‚Äîneither a movie nor a still photograph, but a hybrid photographic image constructed over long periods of time. This began the ongoing Doomsday Clock project, which includes the three-year digital photograph Taking Time currently running at MIRE in the City of Nantes, France, as precursor to a project that includes the creation of a digital photograph that will take one hundred years to complete. Welsby returned to making single channel video projects in 2015. Two works were completed during that year: Momentum (35min). and Entrance Island (17min), shot on a consumer-grade Canon SX 600 camera and edited using Final Cut Pro software. The pared down film making strategy is reminiscent of the low budget ethos of early London Film Makers Cooperative work, and enhanced by the flexibility and immediacy of widely available digital media, which allows artists to work directly in the landscape without the need for heavy equipment and a crew. Shot on a beach in Mexico, the films take consumer-grade digital camera technology to its limits and aim to blur the distinction between nature and technology in showing the dissolution of a derelict hotel that appears to be crumbling back into the earth.

Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. Design and development A prototype Onex The Onex was designed to be economical, have aerobatic capabilities and folding wings, allowing storage in a standard high by wide residential garage. The aircraft has been designed to standard light aircraft FAR-23 static load requirements with the wings supporting more than 10,000 pounds in sandbags during the tests. Intended for the US experimental home-built and light-sport aircraft categories, the company estimates the total price to purchase and build the aircraft to be around US$25,299, making it the least expensive of their kits. The FAA's National Kit Evaluation Team has approved construction checklists demonstrating compliance with the homebuilt requirement that the \\"major portion\\", or 51% of the aircraft, is completed by the builder, not the manufacturer. This also allows the owner to seek commercial help with construction. The first prototype was flown with conventional landing gear with the first flight of the tricycle gear version taking place on October 5, 2011. The prototype was equipped with an AeroVee Volkswagen air-cooled engine. In a February 2, 2011 webinar, Monett discussed many of technical aspects of the Onex, as well as providing a description of the early flight tests. The Onex is constructed from 6061 aluminum and features a single 15-gallon molded plastic fuel tank mounted in the fuselage, situated so the pilot can see the level of the fuel remaining. Monett claims that this type of tank is the safest and placing it in the fuselage, as opposed to in the wing, will reduce the chances of a fire in case of an accident. A further advantage of this configuration is that the fuel system will be gravity-fed and therefore not require a fuel pump, as it would if the tank were in the wings. Monett discussed the aim of simplicity and that a major goal is to reduce the parts count and thereby cost and weight. He also indicated that on the first test flight the aircraft climbed at 1200 ft per minute and was very responsive to the controls. Monett stated also that he had done some cursory testing of the flaps and found the 45¬∞ flap position to be very effective. In a progress update on January 26, 2012, Sonex stated that more than 50 kits had been shipped before the new year, and some were nearing completion.

The house is often cited for its ornate Victorian detail and architectural elements. The first house on the site was built for William H. Hughes and completed in 1855. From 1883 to 1885 the house was significantly redesigned and overbuilt on the previous foundation for Ike J. Young, Civil War Colonel and four-term mayor of Henderson. The design of the current house is attributed to the famed architect Samuel Sloan but that fact has not been officially documented. History In 1853 Demetrius Ellis Young sold two acres of land to William H. Hughes, which was claimed to be the highest point between Weldon, North Carolina and Raleigh, North Carolina. This land had previously been set aside for an all-male educational academy that had been operating for the last decade. It would instead be used as the site of the Hughes house, a Greek Revival style dwelling which was completed in 1855. In the years following the Civil War Hughes experienced a number of financial problems and became unable to continue repayment of his debt for the land. An extended court battle ensued between the Hughes and Young families and ultimately the land was returned to the Youngs in 1883. The heir to the land, Colonel Ike J. Young, began working on plans for a significant redesign and rebuilding of the Hughes house. It is widely speculated that well-known Philadelphia-based architect Samuel Sloan was commissioned to dramatically redesign the Hughes house. Sloan was working in North Carolina on another prominent structures in 1883, including the North Carolina Executive Mansion in Raleigh. Distinct similarities between the completed Mistletoe Villa and the Executive mansion, down to the final color scheme, are often cited by historians as evidence of Sloan's involvement in the design. Unfortunately Sloan died in Raleigh in 1884 before either project was completed. As construction was nearing completion in 1885 Colonel Young made a trip to New York City in search of furnishings for the new home where suffered a stroke and died, never having the opportunity to claim the house as a home. The newly over-built house extends beyond the original stone foundation of the Hughes house, which is still visible. A number of indoor elements, including floor boards, doors, lock hardware, mantels and others items were preserved and repurposed in the house. The completed house is an example of Queen Anne Style Victorian architecture and features multi-faceted detail woodwork. The house was originally lighted by carbide light fixtures which were fueled by gas generated on the property in a small brick building and piped into the house. Although unusual for the era, the house was equipped with indoor plumbing which was supplied and pressurized by a large reservoir in the attic which functioned similarly to a simple water tower. The house also contained other innovative elements for the time including a \\"speak tube\\" which would allow people in the dining room to communicate with servants in the kitchen on the floor below. A button was also integrated into the floor of the dining room which, when pressed, would alert servants downstairs that assistance was desired upstairs. During World War II a 30-foot square iron widow's walk on the roof was donated to the U.S. Government, which was looking for scrap metal from civilians to aide in the war effort. During that same period trains transporting U.S. troops would pass the house and deliver German prisoners of war to a factory next door to work. Children growing up in the house described having conversations with German prisoners with the assistance of a translator as well as playing games of catch with them. It is unknown exactly when the house was given its distinctive name but it has been attributed to \\"all the mistletoe that just drooled from the trees.\\" Restoration efforts Mistletoe Villa was abandoned in 1964 and would remain unoccupied for more than a decade. Near the end of the 1970s the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places and was sold to the NC Historic Preservation Fund to search for a new owners. In 1979 a couple from Washington, D.C. bought the house after seeing it featured in an advertisement in a history-related publication. The couple would complete a 500-mile round trip every other-weekend to make repairs and would own the house until 1991. In addition to using the house as a weekend retreat and project they opened the house to the public and allowed for catered events and parties, a trend that would continue through some future owners as well.

The structure of the Guard consisted of: * The Guard Command * 1 company (21 Officers; 37 Sub-Officer; 412 Guards) * 1 Platoon of Cavalry * Guards Band and Bugles =Socialist Republican Guard (1945‚Äì1991)= After the World War II, the Guard would be named Special Battalion of the General Staff, being a structure within the People's Defense Division (DMP). In February 1947, the department was renamed Republican Guard Department. By the end of the 1940s, the Guard began to recruit new servicemen with the conscription service because until then it consisted of ex-Partisans of the Albanian National Liberation Army (UN√áSH). In 1951, the Guard became part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which charged the battalion with the function of preserving and securing the high-ranking state officials and important members of the communist party, including their residential areas in Ish-Blloku. During these years until November 1968, the Guard was strengthened and modernized, the guard battalion numbered around 600 personnel of all ranks. After the Soviet-Albanian split that then culminated with the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Guard underwent a structural and quantitative change. That was increased from 1 to 3 battalions, in addition, consisted of 4 battalions with reservists, which Command and permanent staff with officers. Also, the Artillery Command was created. In 1976, with the adoption of the new Constitution, the name of the Guard changed; becoming the Republican Guard Regiment of the Socialist Republic of Albania Its organizational chart included: * Command Center * Political department * General Staff of the Guard Regiment * Artillery Command * 3 active infantry battalions (1st to 3rd Battalions, Republican Guard) * 4 reserve battalions (4th to 7th Battalions (Volunteers), Republican Guard) * Instruction Center in Mullet * Autonomous bases (Durr√´s, Vlor√´, Pogradec, Lezh√´ and Kor√ß√´) * 1 anti- aircraft battery equipped with ZPU * 1 artillery battery equipped with ZiS-3 * 1 company each of Flamethrower; Tanks; Engineers Corps; Chemical Corps; Support Corps and Transport Support * 1 armored transport Platoon * Regimental Band On 4 February 1984 the Presidium of the People's Assembly awarded the \\"Order of the National Flag\\" to the Republican Guard Regiment. =1991‚ÄìPresent= Members of the Republican Guard in traditional uniforms in September 2005. On 9 September 1992, the Albanian Parliament adopted the law \\"On the Republican Guard\\", which stipulated that the guard, which at the time was named the Specialized Military Unit, would be the official military guard of honour for the state. In 1993, based on the June 1928 decree of the Guard's creation, the Republican Guard was recreated in its original form. In appreciation for the unit's participation in the Albanian Civil War of 1997, the Republican Guard was decorated with the Golden Medal of the Eagle (‚ÄúMedalja e Art√´ e Shqiponj√´s‚Äù) on its diamond jubilee in 1998. In January 2011, 6 members of the guard were arrested over the deaths of 4 civilian protesters in an opposition demonstration outside Prime Minister Sali Berisha's office. Three of the accused Guards were later released by the general prosecutor. Mission A member of the battalion saluting during the 100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania in 2012.

The exact date of his birth is not known, but he was baptised on 7 October 1737 (Parochial Registers, county of Perth, Clunie). Elder held the office of chief magistrate of Edinburgh (where he carried on business as a wine merchant and grocer) for three different periods, viz. 1788-90, 1792‚Äì1794, and 1796-8. During his second term of office he took an active part in suppressing the meetings of the Friends of the People, and without any military aid he broke up the meeting of the British Convention held at Edinburgh on 5 December 1793, and took ten or twelve of the principal members prisoners. In Edinburgh his shop was on the Royal Mile opposite the Tron Kirk at his house was at 5 Princes Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1790 His house was demolished around 1900.

In 1795 Elder was appointed Postmaster General for Scotland. Through his exertions the scheme for rebuilding the college was successfully matured. The foundation-stone of the new buildings was laid during his first mayoralty on 16 Nov. 1789, but they were not completed until after his death.

He died while flying an early Vickers fighter plane, as a test pilot. Life He was born in Lewisham in southeast London on 3 April 1879, the son of Richard Barnwell, a director of the Clyde shipbuilder, Fairfield. Barnwell was brought up at Elcho House in Balfron, Stirlingshire, and educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh. He had a younger brother, Frank. Frank and Harold Barnwell built their first glider in 1905 in Balfron and later built three powered aircraft. They then opened the Grampian Engineering and Motor Company in 1906 at Causewayhead in Stirling. From their garage, they produced three aircraft between 1908 and 1910. The first was underpowered and failed to fly, but the second aircraft, a canard biplane was successfully flown from a field in Causewayhead under the Wallace Monument on 28 July 1909.Pilcher to the Planets, Cameron, Galbraith and Thomson Piloted by Harold, it only flew 80 yards (75 m) at an altitude of about four metres before it crashed, but it is still recognised as Scotland's first powered flight. Next, the brothers built a monoplane with which Harold won a prize of ¬£50 offered by the Scottish Aeronautical Society for the first flight of more than a mile to be made in Scotland in January 1911.The Scottish War Memorials Project In 1911 both brothers moved to England, and in 1912 Harold, after gaining his pilot's licence (No.278) at the Bristol school at Brooklands in SeptemberAviators CertificatesFlight 7 September 1912 joined the staff of the new Vickers School of Flying, also at Brooklands. Here he was the instructor who helped Noel Pemberton-Billing win his ¬£50 bet with Frederick Handley Page by learning to fly and gaining a pilot's licence in a single day. In late 1914, Harold Barnwell, now chief test pilot with Vickers Limited, designed a single seat \\"scout\\" or fast reconnaissance aircraft, and had it built without the knowledge or approval of his employers, \\"borrowing\\" a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine from Vickers' stores to power the aircraft. Barnwell attempted the first flight of his design, named the \\"Barnwell Bullet\\" in early 1915, but the aircraft crashed and was wrecked, possibly due to a miscalculated centre of gravity.War Planes of the First World War: Volume Three, Fighters, Bruce, J.M.Vickers Aircraft since 1908, Andrews, C.F. and Morgan, E.B. Death, memorial and legacy Harold Barnwell died on 25 August 1917 while test flying the prototype Vickers Vampire night fighter at Joyce Green, Kent. Webster states that he may have been taken ill while at the controls. Harold was buried near Brooklands in St Mary's Churchyard, Byfleet, Surrey. The grave is marked by an unusual obelisk type of memorial with a simple inscription recording the date and location of his death and that the monument was funded by his brothers and sisters. A silver granite sculpture with a wingspan, set atop a cairn at Causewayhead in Stirling, yards from the site of the Grampian Motor and Engineering Company, commemorates the brothers' pioneering flights. A plaque to commemorate the centenary of the first flight was erected in Balfron. Some artifacts from the Barnwells' days were discovered before the Grampian Engineering and Motor Company closed.

The school came about because of the refusal by South Carolina leaders to integrate the University of South Carolina School of Law, which for many years was the state's only institution for legal education. In 1946, John Howard Wrighten III, a black World War II veteran, applied for admission to USC Law School. Wrighten, however, was denied because of his race. He filed suit in 1946 and was represented by four attorneys, including Thurgood Marshall, who later became an associate justice of the US Supreme Court, according to a story in the Orangeburg Times and Democrat. In July 1946, District judge J. Waites Waring held that \\"a Negro resident of South Carolina was entitled to the same opportunity and facilities afforded to white residents for obtaining a legal education by and in the state.\\" Waring gave the state of South Carolina three options: that the University of South Carolina admit Wrighten, that the state open a black law school or that the white law school at USC be closed.Seeking Restoration, Orangeburg Times and Democrat, April 3, 2006 Rather than integrate the University of South Carolina or close it down, the South Carolina General Assembly authorized the establishment of a law school at South Carolina State, then officially known as the Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina. The school opened in 1947 with eight students. Eventually, 50 men and one woman would go to graduate from the law school during its two decades of operation. Its graduates included Matthew J. Perry, who would go on to become the first black lawyer from the Deep South to be appointed to the federal judiciary, and Ernest A. Finney Jr., former chief justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court. The end came when the University of South Carolina School of Law finally began admitting black students in 1964. Enrollment quickly dwindled at South Carolina State's law school and it closed in June 1966. The South Carolina State School of Law left a lasting legacy despite its short existence: It trained a group of black attorneys who would go on to challenge segregation, discrimination and inequality in public education during the 1960s, according to R. Scott Baker in Paradoxes of Education: African American Struggles for Educational Equity in Charleston South Carolina, 1926-1972. In 2005, S.C. Senator Robert Ford introduced a bill to create a study committee to consider the feasibility of establishing a law school at South Carolina State. At the time, the cost of a law school at S.C. State was estimated at $8 million to build the facility, $500,000 a year for faculty salaries and $125,000 a year for administrative salaries.

Shaw gained a place at the Quaker college at Woodbrooke, Birmingham, for a pre-university course in 1941 and later read German and Philosophy at Manchester University, from which he graduated in 1946. While at Manchester University he was an editor of the short-lived journal, Humanitas, along with Herbert McCabe, who later became a Dominican priest. In 1946, Shaw married Gwenyth Baron. They had seven children, including the sociologist Martin Shaw and journalist Phil Shaw. Career Also in 1946, Shaw was appointed a tutor for the Workers' Educational Association in the East Riding of Yorkshire, based at Driffield.

In 1975 he was appointed Secretary-General of the Arts Council of Great Britain, where he remained until retirement in 1983. While at the Council he particularly promoted Arts Education, in line with his lifelong commitment to expanding access to the Arts. Shaw rejected a common assumption about arts funding: > \\"The arts do reach only a minority of the population, particularly the > serious arts which we fund, but I believe you can extend the reach beyond > the middle class... by education. What distinguishes the bourgeoisie is not > a special gift from God but the fact that they've had an education and the > opportunity to enjoy the arts.\\"Shaw in 1981, cited by Francis Beckett.

The village was abandoned prior to 1751 to the ever-growing numbers of animal trappers and traders.  Life among the indigenous villagers  The area was covered by Native American lodges. Many other indigenous villages remained inhabited. Caiuctucuc had been a typical village with a mixture of conical tipis and oblong lodges with a surrounding stockade for protection. Forest land was held in common by the tribe, while the cleared land around Caiuctucuc belonged to the villagers, with each family allotted a portion. Corn, beans, tobacco, melons and gourds were cultivated. Each local village was ruled by a chief or king with absolute power who inherited his position through his mother. The tribal council was commonly formed of the chief, his second-in-command (a warrior general) and a medicine man. The medicine man was a mixture of pastor and doctor, a very important position in a society without scientific medical knowledge. Smoking was more or less seen in a religious sense, with each person sharing a few puffs before passing the pipe. They drank nothing but water, occasionally sweetened with maple sap, until alcohol was introduced by Europeans. Marriage was commonly between older teenage boys and younger teenage girls. Babies were highly protected and nurtured, swaddled on a board, and carried on the back. About 1750, pioneers moved in and renamed the village Will's Creek after a nearby Native American chief. Chief Will lived on top of Will's Knob, a mountain to the north. He claimed all the land in the area, but gladly sold large portions to the immigrants at little cost.

Through its subsidiary Home Trust Company, it provides Canadians a range of credit products including mortgages, credit cards and deposit services. It is regulated under federal legislation. Home Trust operates mainly in regions considered low risk where above average returns may be achieved; it also tends to focus on areas largely ignored by other mortgage lenders. During the 2008 economic crisis, it faced less competition (the number of competitors was halved over the last couple years) and its customer base is unique (overrepresented by people who have had credit problems). Mortgaged properties are residential and non-residential and include apartment and office buildings, hotels, construction and industrial complexes (retail mortgage lending which is also one of the main sources of organic growth, is at the core of the company's business). In 2009, its stock outperformed that of eight major competitors in the uninsured mortgage market. In 2010, it improved the technology used in data/information transfers, which increased the speed and overall efficiency of transactions. When the government of Canada added restrictions to mortgage lending, concerns were raised about new disruptions to Canada's housing market.

Consumer lending provides businesses and individuals services for credit cards (including those paid in full) and other loans. Because it targets the uninsured and those with financing problems (rejected by the large retail banks), people without much credit or past credit problems make up a large part of the client base. Home Capital operates only in Canada where it holds the largest market share in the uninsured mortgage market. The company grew rapidly during the decade leading up to 2011. Asset, annual earnings and revenue growth was consistent (did not decrease over any fiscal period). Although traditionally serving the uninsured mortgage market, insured mortgages represent the fastest growing business segment. Assets under administration represent 36.9% of total assets when combined with aum: total assets increased 36.6% in 2009 and 8.4% between December 2009 and September 2010. During the first three quarters of 2010 residential mortgages totalled $4.74 billion with traditional single family mortgages making up 64.5% of total interest income ($170.156 of $263.775 million). Net interest income ($150.15 million) represents 38.6% of total revenue ($389.1 million, 9M10). Arrears total $71.3 million (2Q09). In terms of assets, securities represent 10.49% of them about twice as much as personal and credit card loans. Residential mortgages make up 49.4% of all loans ($4.7 billion in September 2010). OSC Accusations On April 19, 2017, the Ontario Securities Commission accused Home Capital of making \\"materially misleading statements\\" to investors. None of the allegations have been proven.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/home-capital-shares- plunge-after-osc-allegations/article34768077/ Divisions and subsidiaries For the first nine months of 2010 new insured mortgages amounted to $2.08 billion (twice that of the corresponding 2009 period) while those uninsured grew from $728.6 mill to $2.17 billion.

Ballad sheet written by William Elderton. Huntington Library. William Elderton (died 1592?) was an actor, lawyer, and prolific English ballad-writer, well known in London literary circles. Life Elderon first appears as an actor playing the fourth son of the Lord of Misrule, played by George Ferrers, at the court of Edward VI during the 1552-1553 Christmas season.Hyder E. Rollins. \\"William Elderton: Elizabethan Actor and Ballad-Writer\\", in Studies in Philology 17: 2 (April 1920, University of North Carolina Press), pp. 199-245; p. 200. His son, also named William, was christened on 16 January 1548 as recorded in the parish register of St. Peter's upon Cornhill, London. His wife, Grace Clearton, was buried on 9 November 1553, in the same church, and his servant, Steven Riche, on 8 December 8 of the same year.Rollins 200. Works An early dated ballad of Elderton is The Panges of Loue and louers fttes (sic), 1559. Michael Drayton, in his epistle to Henry Reynolds, writes ‚Äî I scornd your ballet then, though it were done And had for Finis William Elderton. A lost book, entitled Eldertons Jestes with his mery Toyes, was licensed for publication in 1561-2 (Arber, Transcript, i. 179). It provoked 'An Admonition to Elderton to leave the toyes by him begone,' which was followed by 'Eldertons answere for his mery toyes.' Both the 'Admonition' and the 'Answer' are also lost. Among Elderton's extant ballads are *'The true fourme and shape of a monstrous chyld which was borne at Stony Stratforde... 1565'; *'An Epytaphe upon the Death of the Right Reverent and learned Father in God, I. Iuell,' 1571; *'A ballat intituled Northomberland Newes,' &c.;, n. d. (licensed 1569); *'A new Yorkshyre song,' &c.;, 1584, describing a match at archery, in twenty-two six- line stanzas. Some verses of Elderton are printed before Claudius Hollyband's Arnalt and Lucenda, 1575. John Stow in his 'Survey,' (chapter on 'Cheape Warde'), quotes some verses on the images over the Guildhall Gate, composed 'about thirty yeares since by William Elderton, at that time an Atturney in the Sheriifes Courtes there.' From 'A true reporte of the death and martyrdome of M. Campion,' 1581, it appears that he published some 'scurile balates' on Edmund Campion's execution. Elderton died in or before 1592. In that year Gabriel Harvey published his 'Foure Letters,' in which he describes Elderton and Robert Greene as 'two notorious mates and the very ringleaders of the riming and scribbling crew'. He speaks in the same tract of 'Elderton's ale- crammed nose.' Thomas Nashe, in 'Foure Letters Confuted,' 1593, upbraids Harvey for 'plucking Elderton out of the ashes of his ale,' and says that there had been a 'monstrous emulation' between Elderton and Harvey. There are two jocular epitaphs on Elderton in William Camden's 'Remaines,' 1605, p. 56\\\\. Some of his ballads were re-printed by John Payne Collier for the Percy Society ('Old Ballads from Early Printed Copies') in 1840; others are included in 'Ancient Ballads and Broadsides' (Philobiblon Society), 1867. The opening lines of a ballad by Elderton are quoted in Much Ado about Nothing, v. 2. John Ward, in Journal of the American Musicological Society, 1957, X, p. 164 gives more detail of this song \\"The God of Love\\", as sung by Benedick in Much Ado about Nothing.

His Journal of his Voyage to Tripoli and Bassora is reproduced in Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigations of 1599. Early life Eldred was born in 1552 at New Buckenham in Norfolk, where his father had moved from Knettishall in Suffolk. It seems probable that he went to London while still young, devoted himself to business and prospered. He was already a well-to-do merchant when 'upon Shrove Monday 1583' he 'departed out of London in the ship called the Tiger, in the company of Mr. John Newbery, Mr. Ralph Fitch, and six or seven other honest merchants.' Voyage On 1 May they arrived at Tripoli in Syria, and after staying there for a fortnight went on to Aleppo, and thence to Bir on the Euphrates. At Bir they took a boat down the river as far as Feludjah, where after a week's delay they hired a hundred asses to convey their merchandise to Baghdad. There they stayed for some days, and, reshipping their wares in boats on the Tigris, came at length to Bassorah. At Bassorah Eldred remained for six months engaged in the business of the journey, to such good purpose that when he and his companions departed on their return, it took seventy barks, or rather barges, to carry them and their merchandise, consisting mainly of spices; bales of cinnamon and nutmeg being more especially mentioned. These barks were tracked up the stream by fourteen men to each, and so in forty-four days arrived at Bagdad, where the adventurers provisioned for the land journey, and departed in company with many other merchants, and an enormous caravan of four thousand camels, laden with spices and other rich merchandise. After forty days' journey they arrived at Aleppo on 11 June 1584. For the next three years Eldred made Aleppo his headquarters; 'in which time,' to quote his own words, 'I made two voyages more unto Babylon (Bagdad), and returned by the way aforesaid, over the deserts of Arabia. And afterwards, as one desirous to see other parts of the country, I went from Aleppo to Antioch, which is thence sixty English miles, and from thence went down to Tripoli, where, going aboard a small vessel, I arrived at Joppa, and travelled to Rama, Lycia, Gaza, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, to the river of Jordan, and the sea or lake of Sodom, and returned to Joppa, and from thence by sea to Tripoli, of which places, because many others have published large discourses, I surcease to write.' Return to England and subsequent career On 22 December 1587 he embarked at Tripoli for England, and 'arrived in safety here in the river of Thames with divers English merchants, 26 March 1588, in the Hercules of London, which was the richest ship of English merchants' goods that ever was known to come into this realm.' A large part of these riches appears to have belonged to Eldred. He was now a wealthy man, and, having capital at his disposal, accumulated a large fortune. In 1597 he bought the manor of Great Saxham in Suffolk, and built a large house which came to be popularly known as 'Nutmeg Hall.' He continued, however, to reside chiefly in London, engaged in business. When the East India Company was started, he was a large subscriber, was a member of the first court of directors, and for many years took a prominent part in its affairs. He was also, during the reign of James I, a contractor and commissioner for the sale of lands, a customs farmer, and the holder of a patent for the pre-emption of tin. Death He died at Great Saxham in 1632, and was buried there in the church on 8 December. Issue His eldest son was born in June 1590, so that he presumably married shortly after his return from the Levant. His wife was Mary, daughter of Thomas Revett of Rishangles in Suffolk, by whom he had a large family. The firstborn son died in infancy; but the second, Revett, grew up, was made a baronet in 1641 (see Eldred baronets), and died without issue in 1653, when the estate of Great Saxham passed to the family of John Eldred, Revett's next brother. This became extinct in 1745, when the property was sold. 'Nutmeg Hall' was burnt down in 1779; the present Great Saxham Hall was built by the new proprietors in the closing years of the same century. In the church of Great Saxham there is a monument to the memory of John Eldred erected by his son Revett; also a bust with a mural tablet bearing the inscription : ‚Äî \\"The Holy Land so called I have seene, And in the Land of Babilon have beene, But in that Land where glorious Saints doe live My soul doth crave of Christ a roome to give.\\" References Category:1552 births Category:1632 deaths Category:16th-century English businesspeople Category:17th-century English businesspeople Category:English merchants ","title":"John Eldred"},{"id":"30599235","text":"In Greek mythology, the name Coeranus or Koiranos (Ancient Greek: ŒöŒøŒØœÅŒ±ŒΩŒøœÇ \\"ruler, commander\\") may refer to: *Coeranus, an Argive son of Abas, grandson of Melampus, and father of the seer Polyeidos.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.3.1Hyginus, Fabulae 128 & 136 Alternately was called son of Cleitus.Pherecydes in Scholia on Homer's Iliad 13.663 *Coeranus, son of Polyeidos (thus grandson of the precedent), brother of Manto and Astycrateia.

Charlie Brooker, whose earlier TV-related programmes include How to Watch Television, Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe and You Have Been Watching, examines how the medium has bent reality to fit its own ends. Produced by Zeppotron, the series aired its first episode in January 2011. Format The format of the series is similar to that of some of Brooker's other works, such as the abovementioned Screenwipe and Charlie Brooker's Weekly Wipe, with Brooker effectively narrating from a living room set while watching TV. In this series, however, each episode focuses on a particular theme, which Brooker considers to have significantly impacted or have been significantly impacted by TV. Each episode is loosely chronological, starting with earlier TV programmes and adverts, with Brooker commenting on the changes in these over time. A number of clips relevant to the subject and time period at hand are shown, which Brooker usually criticises for being hyperbolic or overly fanciful. Each episode contains a few sketches or fake news broadcasts satirising a particular aspect of the topic discussed. For example, in the first episode, Fear, there is a sketch parodying hyperbolic disaster docudramas, wherein mundane items ‚Äì first pens, then keyboards, then people's 'voices' ‚Äì begin to get \\"hot\\", scalding their users and plunging the Earth into a new dark age before causing it to explode. He ends each episode with a concluding overview of what he sees as the current attitude TV and the public has towards the subject. Reception The series was reviewed mildly positively, with some criticism of the series' topic (criticism of television), some positive remarks about specific segments, and some abuse in jest from Brooker's colleagues at The Guardian: \\"Ha! I mean, boo! I hate him.\\" In the Scotsman, it was noted that \\"though so far Brooker hasn't been pulling any punches\\", some of Brooker's topics were deemed too broad, some of his targets were called \\"too familiar\\", like his mockery of 1970s public service safety announcements, and Brooker himself \\"may be heading towards one of those programmes he has so savagely parodied.\\" The Metro enjoyed Brooker's making \\"merrily sardonic hay\\", and found his skewering of some TV fearmongering \\"spot on\\", but found his targets pretty easy, \\"nicking TV news (‚Äòlike looking directly in the face of terror‚Äô) with flesh-wounds when once upon a time he would have gone for the heart\\", and described the show as \\"cobbled together.\\" Episode list See also * Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe * Newswipe with Charlie Brooker References External links  Category:2011 British television series debuts Category:2011 British television series endings Category:Television series created by Charlie Brooker Category:BBC television comedy Category:Television series about television Category:Television series by Endemol Category:Television series by Zeppotron ","title":"How TV Ruined Your Life"},{"id":"30599301","text":"Thomas Banyacya (June 2, 1909 ‚Äì 1999) was a Hopi Native American traditional leader.

Life Ekins was the son of Dr. Jeffery Ekins, dean of Carlisle, and nephew of Dr. John Ekins, dean of Salisbury (1768‚Äì1809), and was born presumably at Quainton, Buckinghamshire, where his father was then rector. He entered the Royal Navy in March 1781, on board the 74-gun , under the command of the Hon. Keith Stewart. In Berwick he was present at the Battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781, and afterwards went with Captain Stewart to , which was one of the fleet under Lord Howe that relieved Gibraltar in 1782. After continuous service on the Mediterranean and home stations for the next eight years, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 20 October 1790. During the next five years he was mainly employed in the West Indies. Early in 1795 he came home in the 98-gun , bearing the flag of Sir John Jervis, and was in her when she was burnt at Spithead on 1 May. On 18 June he was promoted to the command of the sloop in the North Sea, from which he was appointed to , supposed to be at the Cape of Good Hope, but found, on his arrival, to have been condemned and broken up. He returned to England in command of Havik, one of the Dutch prizes taken at the capitulation of Saldanha Bay. After his return to Britain, he was advanced to post rank 22 December 1796. In August 1797 he was appointed to the 28-gun HMS Amphitrite, and in her was actively employed in the West Indies until March 1801, when, after a severe attack of yellow fever, he was sent home with despatches. From 1804 to 1806 he commanded the 40-gun ; and from 1806 to 1811 the 74-gun , in which he took part in the expedition against Copenhagen in 1807, in the operations on the coast of Portugal in 1808, and in the Baltic cruise of 1809. In September 1815 he commissioned the 74-gun , and commanded her in the bombardment of Algiers, on 27 August 1816, when he was wounded. He later, together with the other captains engaged, was nominated a Companion of the Bath, and by the King of the Netherlands a knight of the Order of William of the Netherlands (C.W.N.). Superb was paid off in October 1818, and Ekins had no further service afloat; though he became in course of seniority rear- admiral on 12 August 1819, vice-admiral on 22 July 1830, and admiral on 23 November 1841; and was made a Knight Commander of the Bath on 8 June 1831, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath on 7 April 1852. He died at 69 Cadogan Place, London on 2 July 1855. He married, in 1800, Priscilla, daughter of Thomas Parlby (1727‚Äì1802) of Stone Hall, Plymouth, Devon. Works Ekins was the author of Naval Battles of Great Britain from the Accession of the illustrious House of Hanover to the Battle of Navarin reviewed (1824; 2nd edit. 1828). He wrote also a pamphlet on the round stem controversy in the form of a letter to Sir Robert Seppings (1824), and developed a system of maritime signalling (London: Thomas Curson Hansard, 1838).

After serving for several years on the Hamburg America Line's route to the Caribbean, she was sold to the Soviet Union in 1940. Following the outbreak of war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in June 1941, she was captured by the Germans and pressed into Kriegsmarine service. She was sunk on 21 October 1942 by a Royal New Zealand Air Force torpedo bomber, while carrying a load of prisoners of war intended for slave labour in German-occupied Norway. In total, 986 people have later been reported killed in the incident; 915 prisoners, in addition to German soldiers and crew members. Construction Palatia was built by Schiffswerft H. Koch A.G. in L√ºbeck in 1928, with yard number 273. Launched on 26 May 1928, and completed in October of the same year, she had a length of 114 metres, beam of 16.4 metres, draught of 6.9 metres and a tonnage of 3,979 tons.Steffenak 2008: 50‚Äì54 She was a single deck, steel-hulled ship with diesel engines, electric lights, wireless radio and a cruiser stern. The 6-cylinder diesel engine produced 3,500 horsepower, and gave Palatia a top speed of 12 knots. Hamburg America Line For the first years of her service life, Palatia sailed for the Hamburg America Line. She sailed between Hamburg and the Caribbean until the outbreak of the Second World War. Second World War In 1940, during a period of improved relations between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Palatia was sold to the Soviet Union and renamed Khasan. After the German invasion of Russia, she was confiscated by the Kriegsmarine on 22 June 1941 while in the German port city of Stettin. She had her original name Palatia restored. On her last mission she was used as a prisoner of war transport from Stettin to √Ölesund, via Kristiansand, in order to bring slave labourers to work for the Nazi occupants. She carried 999 prisoners and a crew of 34, as well as a Norwegian pilot. =Sinking= On 21 October 1942 Palatia was sailing off Lindesnes, Norway, escorted by the submarine chaser UJ 1704 and a Junkers Ju 88. She had originally been part of a convoy of three vessels with three submarine chaser escorts from the port of Kristiansand, but the tanker Ostermoor had suffered engine failure and the fellow prisoner ship Ostland (with 1,000 prisoners on board) had run aground. One of the escorts had also suffered engine failure.Hafsten 2005: 214Thompson 1953: 330 Palatia's renewed departure from Kristiansand only occurred at 09:00. This left her in an exposed position in poor weather when, at 15:05, she was discovered by one of four Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers from No. 489 Squadron RNZAF of the RAF Coastal Command that were patrolling the Norwegian coastline that day. At the time the weather was rainy, with winds from strong breeze to near gale and waves. Hampden XA-B, piloted by Flying Officer J.J. Richardson, attacked at an altitude of , launching a torpedo at a range of . The torpedo bomber escaped unscathed in cloud cover, despite heavy anti-aircraft fire and an attempted intercept by the escorting Ju 88. The torpedo hit Palatia in the starboard side, near her engine room. Palatia sank within half an hour of the torpedo attack, at . Following the torpedo hit panic broke loose on board Palatia, with prisoners attempting to break out of the cargo holds. During the rescue work the crew of UJ 1704 prioritized saving Germans, to the extent that small arms were used against prisoners if they proved to be a hindrance for the rescue of Germans. Only prisoners on rafts or floating debris in the company of German survivors were retrieved. The rescue work was concluded at 18:45. In all only 78 prisoners and 108 Germans survived the sinking. After the incident the crew of Palatia was criticized in German reports for not having conducted the evacuation of the ship in an orderly manner, the sinking thus costing more German lives than might have been the case had the crew acted according to regulations. The number of perished has been listed as 986 people, including 915 prisoners from the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. The incident was not reported in the censored press at the time. For weeks after the sinking of Palatia large numbers of corpses floated ashore on the beaches of the Lista area. The bodies were collected and removed by the Germans. The sinking of Palatia is the second greatest ship disaster in Norwegian history. Post-war wreck discovery and memorial The memorial monument of MS Palatia, Pax by the Lindesnes Lighthouse, created by sculptor Arne Vinje Gunnerud During the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe, the municipality of Lindesnes held a memorial service on 6 May 1995 in remembrance of the Palatia disaster.

It is located northeast of Boron, California. It was closed by the Air Force in 1975 and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The radar site is still operated by the FAA as part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS). History Boron Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 750th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to Atolia, California on 28 January 1952. It assumed coverage responsibilities formerly held by the temporary \\"Lashup\\" site at Edwards AFB site (L-40), and was operating two AN/FPS-10 radars at this new site, and initially the station functioned as a Ground- Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Atolia AFS was renamed \\"Boron Air Force Station\\" on 1 December 1953. The AN/FPS-10 search radar at Boron remained until 1959. In 1958 an AN/FPS-6 replaced the AN/FPS-10 height-finder radar. A second height-finder radar (AN/FPS-6A) was installed in 1959. During 1961 Boron AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-17 at Norton AFB, California. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 750th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 May 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In addition to the main site, a Ground Air Transmit Receive (GATR) site was located 3.5 miles north of the main site, at a heading of 335 degrees, in order to gain some distance from the high-powered RF energy from the search radar systems. The GATR sites were used to communicate audibly to intercept aircraft in order to vector them to airborne targets. AN/GRT-3 http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/military_radio_transmitting_set_an.html systems were the transmitters used, along with AN/GRR-7 http://radionerds.com/images/b/bf/TO-31R2-2GRR7-2.pdf receivers. Backup Transceivers, AN/GRC-27 http://radionerds.com/index.php/AN~GRC-27 systems were used to cover frequencies that were lost due to outages of the main transmitters and receivers. In addition to these, an AN/GKA-5 Time-division Data-link (TDDL) system http://www.radomes.org/museum/equip/radarequip.php?link=gka-5.htmlhttp://www.f-106deltadart.com/sage_system.htm was used to digitally provide the vectoring data to the F-106 Delta Dart intercept aircraft. In addition to the defense mission, Boron AFS became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for use in tracking aircraft in the Los Angeles sector. By this time the AN/FPS-10 had been replaced by an AN/FPS-20 search radar. However, this radar was soon replaced by an AN/FPS-35 FD radar. By 1963 this radar operated with AN/FPS-26A and AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars. Boron AFS was re-designated as NORAD ID Z-59 on 31 July 1963. In 1968 the AN/FPS-90 was inactivated. In 1969 the AN/FPS-35 was removed, and was replaced by an AN/FPS-67 on the same tower (and with a radome); it became operational in 1970. In addition to the main facility, Boron operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Shafter, CA (P-59A) * Joshua Tree, CA (P-76F), (P-59C) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 750th Radar Squadron was inactivated on 30 June 1975. The FAA retained the AN/FPS-67, and continue to operate it today and is now data-tied into the Joint Surveillance System (JSS). Boron AFS was later converted into a Federal Prison in 1979, for minimum security male inmates, which was closed in 2000. The prison site and housing area have been completely demolished. The U.S. Department of Justice is currently investigating trespass activity at FPC Boron.

Heinsius founded his firm, also named Heinsius, in Leipzig in 1725. After Zedler, publisher of the Grosses vollst√§ndiges Universal-Lexicon, had lost control of his firm to Johann Heinrich Wolf around 1735, he became interested in new projects and began to collaborate with Heinsius. In 1740, a number of Zedler's products appeared under the Heinsius name, starting with a relaunch of Zedler's Cabinet magazine, under a slightly altered title. It is not known how successful the new magazine was, or why Heinsius included it in his publishing program since from 1739 he already had a similar monthly magazine under the title of Genealogical and historical messages of the principal events of the European courts. In 1741, there followed the first volume of the General Treasure Chamber, a four-volume commercial lexicon translated by Carl G√ºnther Ludovici from the Dictionnaire Universel de Commerce (General Commercial Dictionary) by Jacques Savary des Br√ªlons. The partners' next publishing project was the Corpus Juris Cambialis (Stock Exchange Laws) of Johann Gottlieb Siegel. Heinsius advertised the two-volume publication in the newspapers in April 1742, seeking Praenumeration subscribers. Both volumes were ready in time for the Leipzig Michaelmas Fair that year. After the Treasury Board and the Corpus Juris Cambialis, Zedler and Heinsius again began a major publishing project. The basis for Heinsius's Historical and Political-Geographic Atlas of the whole world was a translation of the Grand Dictionnaire G√©ographique Et Critique of Antoine-Augustin Bruzen de La Martini√®re. The German version ran to 13 volumes, published by Heinsius between 1744 and 1749. The Heinsius catalog issued in 1748 listed 14,000 titles. The subjects included science, philosophy, biography and literature. Most of the books were 18th-century works in German or Latin, but there were many translations of English, French and Latin works.

Frederick Douglass and the White Negro is a documentary telling the story of ex-slave, abolitionist, writer and politician Frederick Douglass and his escape to Ireland from America in the 1840s. Synopsis The film follows Douglass' life from slavery as a young man through to his time in Ireland where he befriended Daniel O'Connell, toured the country spreading the message of abolition and was treated as a human being for the first time by white people. His arrival in Ireland coincided with the Great Famine and he witnessed white people in what he considered to be a worse state than his fellow African Americans back in the US. The film follows Douglass back to America where he buys his freedom with funds raised in Ireland and Britain. Fellow passengers on his return journey include the Irish escaping the famine who arrive in their millions and would go on to play a major role in the New York Draft Riot of 1863 which Douglass could only despair over. The film examines (with contributions from the author of How The Irish Became White Noel Ignatiev amongst others) the turbulent relationship between African Americans and Irish Americans during the American Civil War, what drew them together and what drove them apart and how this would shape the America of the twentieth century and beyond.

In 2015, he was awarded the AAAI Feigenbaum Prize, a biennial award for sustained and high-impact contributions to the field of artificial intelligence through the development of computational models of perception, reflection and action, and their application in time-critical decision making, and intelligent information, traffic, and healthcare systems. In 2015, he was also awarded the ACM - AAAI Allen Newell Award, for \\"contributions to artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction spanning the computing and decision sciences through developing principles and models of sensing, reflection, and rational action.\\" He serves on the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the US National Academies, and on the Board of Regents of the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). He was nominated in 2019 to serve on the U.S. National Security Commission on AI. He has served as president of the Association for the Advancement of AI (AAAI), on the NSF Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Advisory Board, on the council of the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), and chair of the Section on Information, Computing, and Communications of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).  Work  Horvitz's research interests span theoretical and practical challenges with developing systems that perceive, learn, and reason. His contributions include advances in principles and applications of machine learning and inference, information retrieval, human-computer interaction, bioinformatics, and e-commerce. Horvitz played a significant role in the use of probability and decision theory in artificial intelligence. His work raised the credibility of artificial intelligence in other areas of computer science and computer engineering, influencing fields ranging from human-computer interaction to operating systems. His research helped establish the link between artificial intelligence and decision science. As an example, he coined the concept of bounded optimality, a decision-theoretic approach to bounded rationality. The influences of bounded optimality extend beyond computer science into cognitive science and psychology. He studied the use of probability and utility to guide automated reasoning for decision making. The methods include consideration of the solving of streams of problems in environments over time. In related work, he applied probability and machine learning to identify hard problems and to guide theorem proving. He introduced the anytime algorithm paradigm in AI, where partial results, probabilities, or utilities of outcomes are refined with computation under different availabilities or costs of time, guided by the expected value of computation. He has issued long-term challenge problems for AI‚Äîand has espoused a vision of open-world AI, where machine intelligences have the ability to understand and perform well in the larger world where they encounter situations they have not seen before. He has explored synergies between human and machine intelligence. In this area, he studied the value of displayed information, methods for guiding machine versus human initiative, learning models of human attention, and using machine learning and planning to identify and merge the complementary abilities of people and AI systems. He also investigated the use of Bayesian methods to provide assistance to users. he made contributions to multimodal interaction. In 2015, he received the ACM ICMI Sustained Accomplishment Award for contributions to multimodal interaction. His work on multimodal interaction includes studies of situated interaction, where systems consider physical details of open-world settings and can perform dialog with multiple people. He co-authored probability-based methods to enhance privacy, including a model of altruistic sharing of data called community sensing and stochastic privacy. Horvitz speaks on the topic of artificial intelligence, including on NPR and the Charlie Rose show. Online talks include both technical lectures and presentations for general audiences (TEDx Austin: Making Friends with Artificial Intelligence). His research has been featured in the New York Times and the Technology Review. He has testified before the US Senate on progress, opportunities, and challenges with AI.  AI and Society  He has addressed technical and societal challenges and opportunities with the fielding of AI technologies in the open world, including beneficial uses of AI, AI safety and robustness, and where AI systems and capabilities can have inadvertent effects, pose dangers, or be misused. He has presented on caveats with applications of AI in military settings. = Asilomar AI Study = He served as President of the AAAI from 2007‚Äì2009. As AAAI President, he called together and co-chaired the Asilomar AI study which culminated in a meeting of AI scientists at Asilomar in February 2009. The study considered the nature and timing of AI successes and reviewed concerns about directions with AI developments, including the potential loss of control over computer-based intelligences, and also efforts that could reduce concerns and enhance long-term societal outcomes. The study was the first meeting of AI scientists to address concerns about superintelligence and loss of control of AI and attracted interest by the public. In coverage of the Asilomar study, he said that scientists must study and respond to notions of superintelligent machines and concerns about artificial intelligence systems escaping from human control. In a later NPR interview, he said that investments in scientific studies of superintelligences would be valuable to guide proactive efforts even if people believed that the probability of losing of control of AI was low because of the cost of such outcomes. = One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence = In 2014, Horvitz defined and funded with his wife the One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University. According to Horvitz, the gift, which may increase in the future, is sufficient to fund the study for a century. A Stanford press release stated that sets of committees over a century will \\"study and anticipate how the effects of artificial intelligence will ripple through every aspect of how people work, live and play.\\" A framing memo for the study calls out 18 topics for consideration, including law, ethics, the economy, war, and crime. Topics include abuses of AI that could pose threats to democracy and freedom and addressing possibilities of superintelligences and loss of control of AI. The One Hundred Year Study is overseen by a Standing Committee. The Standing Committee formulates questions and themes and organizes a Study Panel every five years. The Study Panel issues a report that assesses the status and rate of progress of AI technologies, challenges, and opportunities with regard to AI's influences on people and society. The 2015 study panel of the One Hundred Year Study, chaired by Peter Stone, released a report in September 2016, titled \\"Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030.\\" The panel advocated for increased public and private spending on the industry, recommended increased AI expertise at all levels of government, and recommended against blanket government regulation.Peter Stone et al. \\"Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030.\\" One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence: Report of the 2015-2016 Study Panel, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, September 2016. Doc: http://ai100.stanford.edu/2016-report. Accessed: October 1, 2016. Panel chair Peter Stone argues that AI won't automatically replace human workers, but rather, will supplement the workforce and create new jobs in tech maintenance. While mainly focusing on the next 15 years, the report touched on concerns and expectations that had risen in prominence over the last decade about the risks of superintelligent robots, stating \\"Unlike in the movies, there's no race of superhuman robots on the horizon or probably even possible. Stone stated that \\"it was a conscious decision not to give credence to this in the report.\\" = Founding of Partnership on AI = He co-founded and has served as board chair of the Partnership on AI, a non-profit organization bringing together Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, DeepMind, IBM, and Microsoft with representatives from civil society, academia, and non-profit R&D.; The organization's website points at initiatives, including studies of risk scores in criminal justice, facial recognition systems, AI and economy, AI safety, AI and media integrity, and documentation of AI systems. = Microsoft Aether Committee = He founded and chairs the Aether Committee at Microsoft, Microsoft's internal committee on the responsible development and fielding of AI technologies. He reported that the Aether Committee had made recommendations on and guided decisions that have influenced Microsoft's commercial AI efforts. In April 2020, Microsoft published content on principles, guidelines, and tools developed by the Aether Committee and its working groups, including teams focused on AI reliability and safety, bias and fairness, intelligibility and explanation, and human-AI collaboration.

The Bruins led the overall series with Houston 3‚Äì2, which started on September 17, 1977, in the Astrodome. In 2010, the Bruins had defeated the Cougars 31‚Äì13 in the Rose Bowl. The game's first quarter consisted of a 10‚Äì0 lead of Houston over UCLA. Senior running back Michael Hayes was credited with the first touchdown of the game. Redshirt junior Matt Hogan was responsible for the PAT as well as a 35-yard field goal later in the quarter. Although the Bruins' Johnathan Franklin and Joseph Fauria with quarterback Richard Brehaut managed to score two touchdowns, Houston still outscored UCLA in the second quarter. Michael Hayes scored another touchdown for Houston, and fellow senior running back Bryce Beall. Senior wide receiver Tyron Carrier scored the third Cougar touchdown when he received a 23-yard pass from senior quarterback Case Keenum before the half. Houston went to the locker room with a 31‚Äì14 lead. In the second half, UCLA struck back to make the game close, as UCLA scored an unanswered 14 points in the third quarter with two touchdowns by Derrick Coleman and Brehaut respectively. However, the both teams' offenses struggled in the fourth quarter. Houston's senior offensive lineman Chris Thompson recovered a fumble from teammate Bryce Beall in the UCLA end zone to receive credit for a touchdown. Following the score, UCLA's Brehaut completed an 11-yard pass to Anthony Barr in another UCLA touchdown. Freshman kicker Kip Smith's kick was blocked by Houston, thus halting the PAT. Houston won the game with a 38‚Äì34 score. =North Texas= Houston traveled to Denton, Texas, to face North Texas of the Sun Belt Conference for the thirteenth time in program history. A former conference- mate of Houston in the Lone Star Conference, Gulf Coast Conference, and Missouri Valley Conference, the Mean Green led the all-time series against the Cougars 7‚Äì5. However, Houston had won their last three games against North Texas. The game marked the opening of a new home for the Mean Green at Apogee Stadium. Its attendance was 28,075, and was the third-largest in North Texas' history. =Louisiana Tech= In Houston's second away game of the season, the team traveled to Joe Aillet Stadium in Ruston, Louisiana, to compete against Louisiana Tech of the Western Athletic Conference for the sixth time in history. The two programs had first met in 1948, and Houston led the all-time series 3‚Äì2. Louisiana Tech's record was 1‚Äì1, and was coached by second-year Sonny Dykes. With a lopsided 14‚Äì34 score heading into the fourth quarter, Houston managed to achieve their biggest comeback in school history by shutting out the Bulldog offense, and scoring 21 points to win the game. Louisiana Tech took a 7‚Äì0 lead after Lennon Creer scored a 1-yard rushing touchdown with 11:12 left in the first quarter. Tech extended their lead over Houston to 10‚Äì0 after Matt Nelson kicked a 30-yard field goal with 10:10 left in the second quarter. Houston scored its first points of the night with 7:21 left in the second quarter when Case Keenum connected with Michael Hayes for a 54-yard touchdown to cut Louisiana Tech's lead to 10‚Äì7. Louisiana Tech answered with a 2-yard touchdown run by Ray Holley and a 47-yard field goal by Nelson to take the 20‚Äì7 lead at halftime. Both teams traded punts to open the third quarter. With 6:47 left in the third quarter, Louisiana Tech QB Nick Isham completed a 16-yard touchdown pass to Quinton Patton to increase Tech's lead to 27‚Äì7. After Quinn Giles intercepted a pass by Case Keenum, Ray Holley scored his second rushing touchdown in the game on a 7-yard TD run to bring the Louisiana Tech lead to 34‚Äì7 with 5:11 left in the third quarter. Houston began their comeback when Keenum completed a 50-yard touchdown pass with 4:27 left in the third quarter to make the score Louisiana Tech 34, Houston 14. Bryce Beall ran for a 2-yard touchdown to cut the Tech lead to 34‚Äì21 with 12:53 left in the fourth quarter.

Houston took its first lead of the night after Keenum threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to make the score Houston 35‚Äì34 with 1:36 remaining in the game. Houston went on to win the game after Tech turned the ball over on downs in the last minute of the game. Louisiana Tech generated 444 yards on offense on 98 plays. Lennon Creer and Ray Holley combined for 47 carries, 161 yards, and three touchdowns on the ground, as Louisiana Tech ran 66 rushing plays in the game which is tied for the 2nd-most carries by a Bulldog team in the history of the program.2011 Louisiana Tech Football Media Guide, p. 156 Quinton Patton caught five passes for 82 yards and one touchdown for the evening and was later named to the Fred Biletnikoff Award Watch List after the game as a result of his play through the first three games of the 2011 college football season. The crowd of 24,628 at Joe Aillet Stadium for the Louisiana Tech vs. Houston marked the sixth-largest crowd for a Louisiana Tech football game at Joe Aillet Stadium. =Georgia State= Georgia State at Houston Houston returned home for their game against Georgia State. An NCAA Division I FCS independent, Georgia State was coached by Bill Curry, and had a 1‚Äì2 record at this point in the season. This was the first meeting between the two teams, and it marked the end of Houston's out-of-conference schedule. With a score of 56‚Äì0, this was Houston's first shutout victory since the 1999 season, when they defeated Louisiana‚ÄìLafayette 45‚Äì0. Senior quarterback Case Keenum threw for 415 yards, and two touchdowns before being replaced by Cotton Turner in the third quarter of the game. A sell-out game with 32,005 in attendance, the matchup was regionally televised on Comcast Sports Southwest. =UTEP= =East Carolina= =Marshall= Case Keenum became the Football Bowl Subdivision's career leader in total offense, throwing for 376 yards and tying his career high with six touchdown passes as Houston beat Marshall 63‚Äì28. The senior quarterback needed 130 yards to eclipse the record (16,910 yards) set by Hawaii's Timmy Chang from 2000‚Äì04. He moved past Chang on a 30-yard pass to Justin Johnson with 3:56 left in the first quarter. A.J. Graham threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score for Marshall, which lost handily despite gaining 506 yards and winning possession time by 24 minutes.

They last met in the previous season on October 23, 2010, where Houston defeated SMU with a final score of 45‚Äì20. Following Houston's 37‚Äì7 victory, Houston now leads the series 17‚Äì9‚Äì1. The game was previewed on ESPN's College GameDay, where it was broadcast live from the University of Houston campus outside of the Cullen Performance Hall. It was the first time that Houston had hosted an episode of the show, and the first time that it had visited a Conference USA school. Cougar alumnus Carl Lewis appeared as a guest on the show. The game itself was nationally broadcast on Fox Sports Net. =Tulsa= The University of Tulsa Golden Hurricane had an opportunity to accomplish one of the goals set long before the season started: Win the C-USA Western Division Title and play the C-USA Championship game. The task was not easy. Undefeated #8 Houston Cougars (11‚Äì0, 7‚Äì0 in C-USA) were coming to Tulsa to face off against Tulsa Golden Hurricane (8‚Äì3, 7‚Äì0 in C-USA). The winner was guaranteed to host the C-USA Championship game against the C-USA Eastern Division Title. The Golden Hurricane kept the game close for the first half, but 457 yards and 5 Touchdowns by Case Keenum proved to be too much for the Golden Hurricane to keep up with. =Southern Miss= =TicketCity Bowl= and 2012 TicketCity Bowl *Source: Roster Poll rankings References External links *Houston Cougars football Houston Category:Houston Cougars football seasons Category:First Responder Bowl champion seasons Houston Cougars f ","title":"2011 Houston Cougars football team"},{"id":"30599635","text":"The Revolutionary Workers' Party‚ÄìStruggle (Spanish: Partido Obrero Revolucionario-Combate, POR-C) was a small Trotskyist political party in Bolivia.

Nearly 1,700 of documents from the office of the main PLO negotiator, Sa'eb Erekat, and his team have been published, dating from 1999 to 2010.Guardian, 24 January 2011, \\"The story behind the Palestine papers\\" Both Al Jazeera and The Guardian stated that they have authenticated the documents, and a media adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also affirmed their authenticity. Leaders of the Palestinian Authority have complained about the way the documents were presented by Al Jazeera.  Background  The Palestine Papers include documents about the negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the government of Israel that took place intermittently between 1999 and 2010. The negotiations in 1993 that led to the Oslo Accords were the first direct negotiations between the parties. The following \\"peace process\\" focused on the formation of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the territory it would govern. The PA, however, represents only the local people in the Palestinian Territories, not the Palestinians in the diaspora. In 2011, when the Papers were published, the negotiations were in a deadlock after the refusal in September 2010 of the Benjamin Netanyahu government to extend the freeze of settlements building over ten months. Ziyad Clot, as of 2011 the only identified source, felt frustrated about the fact that the great majority of the Palestinian people, the refugees, being one of the \\"remaining issues\\" in the \\"peace process\\", were not properly represented.  Sources of the Papers  The documents were obtained by Al Jazeera and shared in advance of publication with The Guardian in an effort to ensure the wider availability of their content. The Guardian has authenticated the bulk of the Papers independently, but has not sought or been given access to the sources of the documents. Al Jazeera, which published the Papers on their website, has redacted minimal parts of the papers to protect their sources' identities. = NSU = Most of the documents are from the Palestinian negotiation support unit (NSU). The NSU was the PLO's main technical and legal advice organ in the peace negotiations, set up in 1999 and headed by Saeb Erekat. Gershon Baskin, codirector of Israel/Palestinian Center for Research, said, \\"I'm 100 percent sure that it's a former disgruntled employed\\" member of the Negotiations Support Unit headed by Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat. Israel's Channel 10 news show also named the source of the leak as a former member of the NSU. = Clayton Swisher = On 27 January 2011, following Al Jazeera's broadcast of the Palestine Papers, Saeb Erekat appeared on Al Jazeera Arabic, condemning the publication. He accused Al Jazeera journalist Clayton Swisher, who delivered the disclosure of the Palestine Papers, of being a CIA agent and of working for the NSU. He also said that former British intelligence officer Alastair Crooke was involved.Erekat condemns Palestine Papers. Al Jazeera, 27 January 2011 (video) In Ma'an News Agency, Erekat later admitted Clayton Swisher neither worked for the Palestinians nor the US intelligence agency.Palestinian negotiator backtracks on CIA charge. George Hale, Ma'an News Agency, 4 February 2011 A few weeks after the publication of the Palestine Papers, on 11 February 2011, Erekat resigned as Chief PLO Negotiator, citing the release of the papers and due to an internal Palestinian investigation that suggested the Palestine Papers leak had come from a source inside Erekat's office.Erekat quits over Palestine Papers. Al Jazeera, 13 February 2011Palestinian election plan runs into Hamas obstacle. Nasser Abu Bakr, AFP, 12 February 2011 As of February 2017, however, he was still holding the function of Chief Palestinian Negotiator. In his book The Palestine Papers: The End of the Road?, Swisher confirmed account, as he wrote, \\"In the fall of 2010, I traveled the world meeting with US, Israeli, and Palestinian Authority officials who had no idea that I held in my possession the secret records of their negotiations\\". A complaint filed by Erekat and the PLO against Al Jazeera and Clayton Swisher on grounds of unfairness was wholly dismissed in a 19-page ruling released in October 2011. = Ziyad Clot = In a 14 May 2011 op-ed article in the Guardian, Ziyad Clot, a French lawyer of Palestinian descent and a former adviser for the NSU involved in 2008 Annapolis negotiations exposed himself as one of the sources of the leaks. In the Guardian article, Clot said that the so-called peace process was \\"an inequitable and destructive political process which had been based on the assumption that the Palestinians could in effect negotiate their rights and achieve self-determination while enduring the hardship of the Israeli occupation\\". He also said that \\"the \\"peace negotiations\\" were a deceptive farce whereby biased terms were unilaterally imposed by Israel and systematically endorsed by the US and EU\\". Clot emphasized that \\"these negotiations excluded for the most part the great majority of the Palestinian people: the seven million Palestinian refugees\\". He felt \\"that the PLO, given its structure, was not in a position to represent all Palestinian rights and interests\\". Clot resigned from the NSU after he witnessed the killing of more than 1,400 Palestinians in Gaza during the Gaza War. After he resigned, he believed he had a duty to inform the public. In the Guardian article, he also stated: \\"In full conscience, and acting independently, I later agreed to share some information with al-Jazeera specifically with regard to the fate of Palestinian refugee rights in the 2008 talks. Other sources did the same, although I am unaware of their identity.\\"Why I blew the whistle about Palestine, The Guardian, 14 May 2011French lawyer reveals himself as 'Palestine papers' source.

Akiva Eldar, writing in Haaretz, said that the documents are more important than those released by Wikileaks because they deal with current issues regarding permanent borders in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.Akiva Eldar, The Palestine papers: Al-Jazeera trumps WikiLeaks, Haaretz, 24 January 2011. = Settlements = At a meeting in November 2007, Tzipi Livni told Ahmed Qurei that \\"I understand the sentiments of the Palestinians when they see the settlements being built. The meaning from the Palestinian perspective is that Israel takes more land, that the Palestinian state will be impossible, the Israel policy is to take more and more land day after day and that at the end of the day we'll say that it is impossible, we already have the land and cannot create the state\\". According to the documents, in a meeting with Livni in Jerusalem, Qurei proposed that Israel annex all settlements along the border except for the large cities and towns of Giv'at Ze'ev, Ma'ale Adumim, Ariel, and Efrat.Patrick Martin, The Globe and Mail, 23 August 2012, Israel rejected historic concessions, 'Palestine Papers' reveal Livni rejected Qurei's demands that Israel cede these settlements. Qurei suggested to Livni that these settlements be placed under Palestinian sovereignty, but Livni told him \\"you know this is not realistic\\". Condoleezza Rice similarly told Qurei that \\"I don't think that any Israeli leader is going to cede Ma'ale Adumim\\", to which Qurei replied \\"or any Palestinian\\". Rice then told him \\"Then you won't have a state!\\"Al Jazeera ‚àí Palestine Papers, 23 January 2011, \\"The biggest Yerushalayim\\" = Napkin map = \\"Napkin map\\" is a colloquial name for a Palestinian sketch made by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on a napkin, of a map with land swap proposals shown to him by then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert during peace negotiations in mid-2008. According to Al Jazeera, Abbas was not allowed to keep the unofficial map, so he sketched it by hand. During the first of several meetings, the Palestinian Authority proposed a land swap, offering Israel the opportunity to annex all of the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem in return for land concessions by Israel. Olmert, however, offered no concessions in return but an even more aggressive land swap.Al Jazeera ‚Äì Palestine Papers, The \\"napkin map\\" revealed The maps: In Prime Minister Olmert's own proposal, Israel would annex 6.3% of the West Bank. The land in Olmert's map included the four settlements of Gush Etzion (with Efrat), Ma'ale Adumim, Giv'at Ze'ev, and Ariel, in addition to all settlements in East Jerusalem (Har Homa). In exchange for those concessions by the Palestinian Authority, Olmert offered 5.8% of Israeli land as part of the swap. The land offered consisted of lightly populated farmland, which would be divided between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. When Mahmoud Abbas asked to keep a copy of the map for further consideration, Ehud Olmert refused to comply. Mahmoud Abbas was forced to sketch Ehud Olmert's map by hand on a napkin to have a copy for further consideration.Al Jazeera ‚Äì Palestine Papers, Summary of Ehud Olmert‚Äôs ‚ÄúPackage‚Äù Offer to Mahmoud Abbas ‚Äì August 31, 2008 This map was then later referred to as the Napkin map. The third and final meeting occurred on 16 September 2008. It was during this time that Ehud Olmert was nearing the end of his political career. At the time, Olmert was under police investigation for alleged corruption that had occurred while he was Mayor of Jerusalem, and as a result of the accusations was not planning on running again. During the final meeting, Mahmoud Abbas was prepared by the Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) to clarify many questions regarding Ehud Olmert's peace plan in which Abbas was quoted as asking questions such as \\"How do you see it addressing our interests, especially as Ariel, Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Har Homa and Efrat clearly prejudice contiguity, water aquifers, and the viability of Palestine?\\" as well as others about the value of the land that they would receive in such a swap in terms of value and size. The Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) also insisted that Prime Minister Olmert provide them with a copy of the map, which was again denied. In the end, however, Mahmoud Abbas asked for a few days to consider the offer. A day after this meeting, Olmert resigned and Tzipi Livni stepped in as Acting Prime Minister, with Benjamin Netanyahu being elected shortly afterward. Palestinian negotiators said Abbas had forgotten another appointment and postponed the next meeting. Netanyahu thought Olmert had made too many concessions and refused to continue from where the last round of negotiations had left off, preferring to restart the negotiations from the beginning. = Jerusalem = According to one of the documents, the Palestinian Authority was prepared to concede most Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, as well as the Armenian Quarter, with the exception of Har Homa. The Temple Mount would be temporarily administrated by a joint body consisting of the Palestinian Authority, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States until a permanent solution was reached. At the meeting in Jerusalem in November 2007, Tzipi Livni became visibly angry when asked about the demographic composition of the future Israeli state. She was quoted as saying, \\"Israel the state of the Jewish people‚Äîand I would like to emphasize the meaning of 'its people' is the Jewish people‚Äîwith Jerusalem the united and undivided capital of Israel and of the Jewish people for 3,007 years\\". The Palestinians team then protested her position on Jerusalem. She responded by saying \\"Now I have to say, before we continue, in order to continue we have to put out Jerusalem from your statement and from our place. We have enough differences, without putting another one out there\\". = Security = The minutes of the trilateral meeting on 26 August 2008 reveal that Israel not only demands a \\"demilitarized\\" Palestinian state, but also wants to keep control over borders, Jordan Valley and airspace, after withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the West Bank, for reasons of security. Tzipi Livni: \\"In the Jordan Valley ‚Äì what will be between Palestine and Jordan. EWS. [Early Warning Stations] ... the I is that we will have something on the crossings, borders, etc ... The idea is to withdraw, but to keep a presence, not close to the situation today, on the EWS, on passages ...\\"Al Jazeera ‚Äì Palestine Papers, Meeting Summary, 26 August 2008, second part, pp. 18‚Äì19; on = Refugees = Yankie Galenty, a media adviser for Ehud Olmert, affirmed the complete authenticity of the documents in an interview. In regards to refugees, he stated that \\"Olmert, from day one, did not deceive Abu Mazen and told him that Israel will not allow the return of refugees and not one refugee will return to the land of Israel.\\"Olmert adviser says Al- Jazeera leaks 100% correct, Al-Ahram, 24 January 2011 Other officials in the Israeli government asked for a limited right of return numbering between five and ten thousand, out of a total of five million refugees, who would be carefully picked by Israel and allowed to stay under \\"humanitarian conditions\\". US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice proposed settling Palestinians refugees in Argentina and Chile as an alternative to letting them return to former homes in Israel and the occupied territories during a meeting. In her memoirs, Condoleezza Rice wrote that Olmert initially proposed that Israel accept 5,000 Palestinians refugees. Abbas rejected the offer, saying, \\"I can't tell four million Palestinians that only 5,000 of them can go home\\". According to the second night of the Al-Jazeera broadcast, Israelis and Palestinians eventually agreed that Israel would accept 10,000 refugees.  Reactions  = Palestinian Authority = Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the leaked documents deliberately confuse Israeli and Palestinian positions, and that he had kept the Arab League updated on all details of the negotiations with Israel. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the leaks were \\"a pack of lies\\", containing mistakes and inaccuracies and that his words were taken out of context and he had been misquoted. Erekat said that the \\"Palestinian Authority would never give up any of our rights. If we did indeed offer Israel the Jewish and Armenian Quarters of Jerusalem, and the biggest Yerushalayim as they claim, then why did Israel not sign a final status agreement? Is it not strange that we would offer all these concessions which Israel demands, yet there is still no peace deal?\\" Yasser Abed Rabbo, giving the PA's first official response, accused Al Jazeera and the Government of Qatar of attacking the Palestinian Authority, having a hostile attitude towards the PA since the days of former president Yasser Arafat.PA hits back at Qatar‚Äôs Amir, Al-Ahram, 24 January 2011 Abed Rabbo was quoted saying that the Al-Jazeera leaks are \\"a distortion of the truth\\". Abed Rabbo accused the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, of giving Al Jazeera the \\"green light\\" to start the campaign, and called on the Emir to \\"extend the climate of transparency in his own state and reveal his true relations with Israel and Iran\\". Mahmoud al-Zahar, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, stated that the Palestinian Authority officials should be ashamed of themselves. Ahmed Qurei, former Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority and chief Palestinian negotiator in the 2008 talks, said that \\"many parts of the documents were fabricated, as part of the incitement against the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian leadership\\". Nasser Gawi, a lead organizer for demonstrations in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where he had been recently evicted by Israeli settlers from his home, was quoted as saying \\"Erekat must have become more Zionist than Zionist. He has no mandate to give up Sheikh Jarrah or an inch of Palestine.\\" = Israel = Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that \\"even the most left-wing government of Olmert and Livni did not manage to reach a peace agreement, despite the many concessions.\\" He also promoted his plan for peace, which would allocate 45% to 50% of the West Bank for the creation of a Palestinian state.Lieberman: Leaked Palestinian papers prove interim deal is only option, Haaretz, 24 January 2011 Livni said that \\"the [peace] process did not fail and was not exhausted. It did not end, but was not allowed to ripen until an agreement was reached because of elections in Israel and this government's choice not to continue the negotiations.\\"  See also  * United States diplomatic cables leak, also known as Cablegate * Iraq War documents leak, also known as the Iraqi War Logs * Afghan War documents leak  References   External links  * Search the Palestine Papers on Al Jazeera's English Transparency Unit * The Palestine Papers by Al Jazeera English * The Palestine Papers by The Guardian * The Palestine Papers by The Real News * The Palestine Papers by the Jewish Virtual Library * Rashid Khalidi: Leaked \\"Palestine Papers\\" Underscore Weakness of Palestinian Authority ‚Äì video report by Democracy Now! * Palestinian negotiators say leaked papers real by Abbas Al Lawati of Gulf News Category:2011 in the Palestinian territories Category:2011 in Israel Category:Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process Category:Classified documents Category:The Guardian Category:Al Jazeera Category:Diplomatic correspondence Category:News leaks ","title":"Palestine Papers"},{"id":"30599657","text":"USS Joanna (SP-1963), was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1920.

It is located south-southeast of Cambria, California. It was closed in 1980. History Cambria Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 775th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was initially assigned to a temporary \\"Lashup\\" site (LP-2) that was established in November 1951 at Cambria equipped with an AN/TPS-1C radar. On 1 December 1953 the permanent station was activated with AN/FPS-3 search and AN/CPS-4 height-finder radars, replacing the earlier site, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1955 the height-finder radar was replaced by an AN/FPS-6. An AN/FPS-8 search radar also operated for a short time from 1955 to 1956. In 1959 the site featured two AN/FPS-3, and AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-6A radars. In 1961 the site received an AN/FPS-7 radar featuring ECCM capability. In 1961 the site also replaced the AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar with an AN/FPS-6B model. In April 1961 Cambria AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-17 at Norton AFB, California. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 775th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 May 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1963 an AN/FPS-26A replaced the AN/FPS-6B height-finder radar, and continued routine radar surveillance throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Cambria AFS was re-designated as NORAD ID Z-2 on 31 July 1963. In addition to the main facility, Cambria operated the AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Lockwood, CA (P-2A) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1979 Cambria came under Tactical Air Command (TAC) jurisdiction with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the creation of ADTAC. Operations ceased on 30 September 1980 as a result of budget restrictions, and the general phase down of air defense radar stations. It was operated by the Coast Guard as a NAVTEX (Navigational Telex, broadcasting safety notices & weather info to ships) station. Today, what was Cambria Air Force Station is in private hands. The station sold to Big Cats LLC, Bernd Schaefers on January 13, 2005 for $2,000,000. Most buildings are in reasonable condition with most of the towers still remaining. After completion of code upgrades and de-militarization, the Uniphi Foundation, a subsidiary of Our Kids Future Foundation (a not-for-profit California corporation), is planning to use it as a Uniphi Foundation Learning Center.

The laboratory specialises in researching and developing antibody type treatments for adults and children with currently incurable types of leukaemia. The laboratory was opened officially on 21 February 1993 by Gary Lineker and his former wife Michelle and in 2008 underwent a complete refurbishment. Originally part of the University of Southampton Medical School, The Simon Flavell Laboratory became independent in 2005 though still affiliated to the School of Medicine but now funded by the children‚Äôs leukaemia research charity Leukaemia Busters and other charitable sources. The Simon Flavell laboratory focuses on translational research designed to bring benefits to patients directly. In the early years the laboratory was involved in the development and manufacture of two different immunotoxins for treating patients with lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and multiple myeloma in phase I clinical trials. This continues and now the laboratory is involved in developing the next generation of genetically engineered immunotoxins that should prove safer to use and cheaper to manufacture. A main theme of the laboratory‚Äôs current research work is to devise ways of improving the therapeutic window for immunotoxins to make them safer and more effective to use clinically. The laboratory is currently headed by Simon‚Äôs parents David Flavell and Sopsamorn (Bee) Flavell . The purpose of this Laboratory is to ensure that patients do not have to experience as much chemotherapy. The reason why this laboratory even opened was to support Simon Flavell and other people who have high potential for Leukemia, to make sure they would not have to experience as much pain.

It uses two restored vintage streetcars which carry tourists along Nelson's waterfront and was the first operating heritage streetcar line in British Columbia. The service is seasonal, starting on the Easter weekend and ending on the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend each year. It is operated by the non-profit Nelson Electric Tramway Society (NETS). The line was opened on June 15, 1992, by the city's mayor; a second opening ceremony was held on July 1, 1992.Light Rail and Modern Tramway, October 1992, p. 271. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association. Nelson's original streetcar system operated from 1899 to 1949. It was run by the privately owned Nelson Electric Tramway Ltd. from 1899 until 1908 and then, following a suspension of service when a fire destroyed a substation, was restored to operation in 1910 by a newly formed Nelson Street Railway Company and, in turn, became municipally owned in 1914. The heritage streetcar line adopted the name of the town's first streetcar company. Car 23 Car 23 was built in 1906 by the John Stephenson Company (then owned by the J. G. Brill Company).

In 1951 the car's body was sold and turned into a dog kennel and eventually a chicken coop. NETS purchased car 23 in 1982 and together with the Chamber of Commerce and Selkirk College restored the car body cosmetically. Later, replica trucks were fabricated, so that the car could be returned to operating condition. Car 400 Birney-type car 400 was originally ordered in 1921 by the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) from the Preston Car Company. The car was manufactured in Preston, Ontario, and shipped in parts to the BCER for final assembly at their yards in Vancouver before entering service in Victoria, British Columbia in March 1922. The car was retired from service in 1948, then sold to the Mayo Lumber Company in Cowichan Lake to be used as a bunkhouse. Purchased in 1970 by the provincial museum, the car was restored in 1973 for static display. Purchased by the society in 1990, the car was restored to operating condition. By 1999, this work was nearly completed, and the car was expected to be placed into service in 2000, but various issues subsequently delayed the car's entry into passenger service until 2005 or later. Currently, car 400 is not in regular service, and all scheduled trips use car 23.

Life Born at Knipe, Westmoreland, on 28 August 1726, he was the son of a maltster from a family of Rutter, Appleby. His mother was the only daughter of Edward Stevenson of Knipe, a relative of Edmund Gibson. Robertson was educated at the free school at Appleby, and on 17 March 1746 matriculated from The Queen's College, Oxford. He graduated B.A. on 19 Oct. 1749, and took holy orders about 1752, being appointed curate to Dr. Sykes at Rayleigh, Essex. In 1758 he was presented to the living of Herriard in Hampshire, and married. He became rector of Sutton, Essex, in 1770, and in 1779 vicar of St. Mary's Church, Horncastle, by the gift of his relative Edmund Law. Robertson died of apoplexy on 19 January 1802, in his seventy-sixth year. His wife, a daughter of Timothy Raikes, chemist, of London, survived him, but his children all died in infancy. Works Robertson was a prolific writer with a reputation as a critic. In 1772 he revised for the press Gregory Sharpe's posthumous sermons, and in the same year edited Algernon Sidney's Discourses on Government, at the request of Thomas Hollis. In The Critical Review he contributed over 2,600 articles between 1764 and 1785. He also wrote in the Gentleman's Magazine, and produced a learned work on the authenticity of the Parian Chronicle (London, 1788), which was answered by John Hewlett.

In 1964, the station's Westinghouse AN/FPS-27 Radar was installed (removed 1969) and the AN/FPS-6B was modified to an AN/FPS-90. In April 1976 the squadron was redesignated Detachment 1 of Luke AFB's 26th Air Defense Squadron (the AN/FPS-26A was removed in this time frame). The radar station with 18 military & 5 civilians was planned for transfer after the 1978 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. After the station transferred to the FAA when Aerospace Defense Command was inactivated, the Air Force continued to operate the AN/FPS-90 height-finder by then modified to an AN/FPS-116 (removed c. 1988). In the late 1990s, the Air Force terminated the data-tie at San Pedro Hill and established a data-tie with the new Navy-installed ARSR-4 radar at San Clemente Island's Mount Thirst.

Life Anthony Peter Arida was born Selim Ben Abdel Ahad Arida in Bkerkasha, Lebanon on February 2, 1863. He learned Arabic and Syriac as a schoolboy. From 1884 to 1890 he studied theology at the school of Saint- Sulpice, Paris. He was ordained a priest on September 28, 1890, and served as secretary and canon lawyer for the Maronite Patriarch John Peter El Hajj.

Selim had two brothers Joseph Arida and Richard Arida. They immigrated to Argentina and then to Australia where they settled in Charters Towers and became successful businessmen. When World War I broke out Joseph Arida and his wife Adma Rahme were at Mount Lebanon, and were interned by the Turks. Joseph bribed his way out of prison and escaped to the mountains; there he together with his brother, the Maronite bishop of Tripoli, Lebanon at the time, became known for their charity during the famine that followed the Turkish blockade. Patriarch Arida openly condemned the treatment of Jews in Germany in 1933. He addressed an encyclical calling on Maronites throughout the world to dedicate their Sunday prayers and homilies to the Jews of the world. He explained that Hitler's Germany had distorted Christian teachings: \\"We ought never forget that the Jews are our brothers in humanity, and that Almighty God has chosen them, and no one else, as keepers of His Divine Oneness and His Eternal Truth.\\" The message was in line with a series of memoranda that the patriarch had begun dispatching to various Lebanese, French, and Jewish organisations, beginning in May 1933.Franck Salameh, \\"Lebanese Jews between rootedness and exile: Braving World War II, the Holocaust, and their aftermath\\", The Journal of the Middle East and Africa, 7(3), pp 301-320, 10 November 2016, DOI: 10.1080/21520844.2016.1233518 Near the end of his life the Holy See appointed an apostolic committee to assist in the management and administration of the Patriarchate.

Owen is a luxury motor dealer in Britain, and one of the world's largest retailers in Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti brands. The company is headquartered in London, and operates 14 sales franchises and 17 aftersales franchises. H.R. Owen runs the only Bugatti-approved showroom in the United Kingdom, and the world's oldest Bentley showroom: Jack Barclay in Mayfair. It also operates the only flagship Ferrari commissioning suite of its kind, the Ferrari Atelier in Knightsbridge. In 2015, Ferrari named H.R. Owen as the best Ferrari dealership in the world, after the business scored the maximum number of points in all of the judging categories. Then, in 2018, H.R. Owen's Rolls- Royce Motor Cars London showroom was awarded Global Dealer of the Year by Rolls-Royce. Founding Harold Rolfe Owen was born in Yorkshire on 6 November 1899, and served in the Royal Flying Corps in World War I. Serving in Northern France in 1917 the 18-year-old Captain Owen was badly injured in a crash, spending a week in a coma. It was almost a year before he could walk again, but after the war was over he returned to uniform, joining the Indian Army. Owen subsequently served for some years abroad, principally at Bombay, Karachi and Aden, before returning to Britain and beginning work at the National Benzole Company. A keen sportsman, Owen's skill as a polo-player made him welcome at society house parties. This gave him many useful sales contacts when he joined Rolls-Royce and Bentley retailer Jack Barclay in 1927, becoming general manager a short while later. Harold Owen and Jack Barclay parted company amicably five years later when the former decided to start out on his own in motor retailing ‚Äì though the two names would be linked once again 68 years later, when the two companies bearing their names were reunited. The new H.R. Owen Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealership opened in Mayfair's Berkeley Street in February 1932 and continued trading until the outbreak of war, when luxury car retailing came to an enforced halt. Harold Owen fully intended to resume the motor retail business post-war, but he fell ill when on tank manoeuvres with his regiment, the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, and died 17 February 1940, following an emergency operation to remove a brain tumour. Post war 1946‚Äì70 Following Harold Owen's death, the H.R. Owen business was bought by Percy Fritz Swain, who reopened the business in 1946 on the old location in Berkeley Street. An astute trader, Swain began to build a larger motor empire, buying up retailers as well as coachbuilders and suppliers. On the death of A.J. Webb in 1955, Swain bought coach builder Freestone and Webb. The post-war years were not kind to independent coachbuilders as prestige manufacturers such as Bentley and Rolls-Royce were obliged by advances such as monocoque construction (finally adopted in 1965 for their Silver Shadow and T-series cars) to shift from supplying only the chassis and drivetrain of a vehicle to building the complete car, bodywork and all. With Freestone and Webb's main chassis supplier relationship coming to an end, the coachbuilding business continued to refurbish and build bodies until 1958, when it became only a name for a showroom.

The Times, Thursday, 4 Aug 1960; pg. 14; Issue 54841 Swain sold the Rolls-Royce and Bentley distributorships and the allied service function to The Provincial Traction Company having previously sold H.R.

Owen's foundation, Malaya Group changed its name to H.R. Owen plc. In 2000 the group bought Jack Barclay, thus becoming the world's largest dealer for Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars. Although the two brands were split at manufacturer level in 1998 between Rolls-Royce Motor Cars (bought by BMW Group), and Bentley (Volkswagen Group), H.R. Owen continues as a Rolls- Royce retailer, while Jack Barclay of Berkeley Square remains the world's largest Bentley dealer. In 2004 the H.R. Owen group sold its Volkswagen and the majority of its BMW brand dealerships to their respective manufacturers. A year later the firm was appointed official UK dealer for Bugatti and by 2008 became the world's largest Bugatti dealer. The company was quoted on the London Stock Exchange under the securities code HRO.L. In early 2011, as part of a new alliance with Ferrari, the company opened a flagship Ferrari 'Atelier' in London's Knightsbridge, where potential customers can customise their new car. In August of that year HR Owen announced the acquisition of Broughtons of Cheltenham, a smaller luxury motor dealer, for an enterprise value of ¬£2.8 million. Broughtons owned three Bentley franchises in Cheltenham, Pangbourne and Byfleet (strengthening HR Owen's relationship with Bentley) and an Aston Martin franchise in Cheltenham, forging a relationship between HR Owen and Aston Martin for the first time. Under the leadership of CEO Ken Choo, H.R. Owen continues its focus on customer service in the field of luxury and supercar retail, whilst extending the customer offering on new business areas including H.R. Owen Specialist Cars and H.R. Owen Insurance Services. In 2014, H.R. Owen generated ¬£400 million in revenue. ;Berjaya Group In September 2013, H.R. Owen was the subject of a successful takeover by Malaysia investment group Berjaya Group, who paid ¬£43.2 million for the company, becoming its majority shareholders. Then in 2016, the Berjaya Group, led by its founder Vincent Tan, fully acquired H.R. Owen for an additional ¬£149.8m.

Opened in 1973, the mall formerly included Dillard's, JCPenney, Macy's, and Sears as its anchor stores. The mall had become increasingly vacant since the beginning of the 2000s. It closed in July 2014 and has been slated for redevelopment as an open-air center. History Construction began on the mall in 1972. Its anchor stores at the time were Sears and Stix Baer & Fuller, a local chain based in nearby St. Louis. The Stix store was converted to Dillard's in 1984 after Dillard's acquired the chain. Famous-Barr (now Macy's) was added as a third anchor in 1994, and two years later, JCPenney relocated to the mall from an existing store in Florissant. A movie theater was also added in the 1990s. Jacobs Group sold the mall to Carlyle Development Group in 2003. At the time, the complex was approximately 30 percent vacant. In April 2006, Dillard's Inc. announced the closure of the Jamestown Mall store, and Sears closed two years later. Carlyle announced redevelopment plans in 2008. Under these plans, the former Dillard's would be converted to offices, and its wing would be closed to retail. A year later, St. Louis County hired researchers from the Urban Land Institute to analyze the mall's viability as a retail center. The study found that the center was no longer viable as a shopping mall because it overlapped with existing retailers in the area. These plans were canceled in 2009 when the mall developers lost financial support from the county following an attempt to auction the former Dillard's store. Further plans in 2010 called for the demolition of everything except the JCPenney and Macy's stores, with the rest of the complex to be re-developed as a mixed-use center. In June 2011, a furniture store called Central States Liquidation opened in the former Dillard's. The JCPenney Outlet store, which was renamed JC's 5 Star Outlet, closed in late 2013. In late 2012, gas service to the mall was shut off but later restored. The mall was closed in November 2013 due to the heat being shut off.

Scott‚Äôs 1910 portrait of William Goodell (1829‚Äì1894) hangs in the M√ºtter Museum in Philadelphia.Transactions & Studies of College of Physicians of Philadelphia, 4 Ser., V. 18, No. 2 Scott spent a number of years living in Darjeeling, India. With oil on canvas, Scott painted a wide range of subjects throughout his travels. Some of these subjects included portraits, the Himalayas, the Taj Mahal, the Sanchi Tope, etc. The Fine Art Society, London, exhibited Alexander Scott's painting and sketches of India and Kashmir in 1889, and also posthumously in 1932. Scott was married to a woman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, which is where he made his home for many years. Scott was also an avid collector of ancient artifacts, which he obtained from locations all over the world. In 1914 Scott began corresponding with the director of the University Museum in Philadelphia, USA, George Byron Gordon. This initial correspondence was with regard to his personal collection of artifacts that he thought the museum would be interested in purchasing. Originally, he considered selling his objects to the Fairmount Park Authorities in Philadelphia, but wanted to keep the collection together and believed the University of Pennsylvania's Museum would be the ideal final resting place for his objects. Photographs and descriptions of some of his collection were published in the Museum Journal in June 1914. Scott continued to make annual trips back to India. After some initial correspondence and meetings with Gordon in 1914, Scott requested to be given an official title to help him in acquiring objects during his next trip to India. He was given the title of Honorary Representative of Oriental Archaeologist at the University Museum of Philadelphia. For the Alexander Scott Expedition to India (1915‚Äì1918), Scott was no longer selling his personal collection to the University Museum in Philadelphia, but specifically purchasing objects for the museum. He discussed potential finds with Dr Gordon throughout his travels, and often sent photographs and descriptions before making purchases. Occasionally, Scott took personal financial risks and purchased objects that he believed could not be passed up. This happened on occasions where Dr Gordon did not reply to Scott in a timely manner about whether or not to make the purchase in his letters. While in India, Scott befriended the Director-General of Archaeology in India, Sir John Marshall. Scott painted for Marshall while staying at his camp in Taxila, where he also witnessed tribal fighting. Scott spent time in Gandhara country, Sanchi, Bhopal and visited the ancient city of Mattra, among other various locations. He visited excavation sites, painted, and searched for valuable objects to purchase for the museum. Many of his purchases came from private hands. On a later trip to Tibet, Scott obtained a number of other objects that the museum subsequently purchased. Around 1917, Scott‚Äôs first wife died. In 1920, at 64 years old, he remarried a Mabel Winifred Bowbeer. Alexander Scott died five years later in 1925, which is when Mrs Scott began corresponding with the museum and continued to do so until 1948. Footnotes References * Severson, Don R.

A sequel, Strike Commando II (Trappola diabolica), was released in 1988 and stars Brent Huff as Sgt. Michael Ransom. Plot Sgt. Michael Ransom (Brown) and his team of \\"Strike Commandos\\" are sneaking into a Vietnamese base, who are planning to lay explosives. Colonel Radek and Ransom's majors watch from a nearby vantage point. All prove to be successful, until one of the commandos is caught and killed by a sentry, rising the alarm. The commandos have no choice but to retreat, but Colonel Radek who is in charge of the mission demands the explosives be set off as the commandos are still retreating. One of the explosives kill one of Ransom's soldiers as he retreats, and Ransom is blown into a river. Ransom drifts unconscious in the river until he is found by a village boy, who treat and nurse him back to health. He speaks with Le Due (Pigozzi) a retired French soldier who says the village used to be a church until the Viet Cong kept attacking. Ransom also learns that there is a Russian presence in Vietnam. Ransom agrees to take the Vietnamese village people to safety in an unknown location. As they come across a decomposed dead soldier who has a radio, Ransom calls his home base and tells his commander that he's alive and where he could be picked up. However, he also says that the Strike team demands justice and that he will strike vengeance. Radek sends a helicopter to retrieve Ransom at a specific spot. Ransom and the village people make camp, as Ransom talks to the village boy who saved him about the wonders of America and Disneyland. The next day, the group run into resistance while trying to cross a river, and are shot down by a nearby patrol boat. Ransom decides to go into the river and take down the boat. However, the group is flanked by a group of VC's who are taken down by Le Due with a grenade. Ransom dumps a huge amount of grenades into the boat and kills everyone in the patrol boat. Later, the village people still make their retreat out of the jungle. While Le Due stops to catch his breath he is caught and choked to death by a Russian soldier. Ransom finds the corpse of Le Due and finds a Russian patch symbol torn from the soldiers uniform. The Russian soldiers are in search of the village people as Ransom kills them off one by one. Ransom soon discovers, however, that there are too many and that he must retreat. Radek commands the helicopter to retreat to base, but Ransom's major is able to talk the soldier into picking him up anyway. Ransom's major is able to calm Ransom so much so that Ransom volunteers to go back to take pictures of the base so that there will be proof of Russian presence in Vietnam. Ransom goes back to Vietnam but finds the village people have been slaughtered. Ransom finds the village boy that helped him in the beginning as he is dying. Ransom tells him more things about the amazing Disneyland, just as he dies. Ransom finds the name of the Russian soldier, Jakoda, and seeks revenge. Ransom mugs a VC and he tells him where to find Jakoda. Ransom, enraged, fires at the village with his stolen M60 machine gun. Jakoda finds Ransom reloading the weapon, but he is able to talk Ransom into surrendering by holding a civilian hostage. Ransom's superiors find out that there are Russians in there and that now he is going to be tortured. They brutally torture Ransom by having him do exhausting yard work for hours, beating him, electrifying him, and burning his back with a blow torch. After spending months in a cell with a corpse, Ransom breaks and agrees to make a demoralizing radio broadcast. However, he is able to get the best of the Russian soldiers and kills them. Ransom takes Jakoda's girlfriend Olga (Kamteeg) hostage, he is able to kill some of the soldiers using Olga as bait. He then radios Radek to bring another chopper to pick him up, and he kills more of the soldiers. When Ransom and Olga reach the pick up point, Olga says that they will not pick up Ransom but attempt to kill him. The helicopter flies by but kills Olga and almost kills Ransom. Ransom is able to gun down one of the gunmen and the helicopter retreats. Ransom then comes across an army boat and dives in to go kill some more soldiers. A VC sneaks up on him and strangles him, but Ransom is able to stab him and dives out when the ship explodes. Ransom comes back to the shore and kills a Russian soldier, but Jakoda boots him in the head and challenges Ransom in a fight. Ransom and Jakoda brutally beat each other until Ransom gets the best of Jakoda and propels him into a waterfall, possibly killing him. Ransom yells in triumph. Ransom is able to find his way back to base and is enraged and looking for Radek. He fires at Radek's office. But Ransom's major says that Radek has gone AWOL. However, one of the generals finds out where Radek is hiding. Ransom finds out that Radek has actually become an importer/exporter in Manila. Ransom arrives at the building where Radek is, and goes to the front desk lady. He then lays a 2-minute grenade on the ash tray on the desk. The lady then alerts all the people. Ransom roams the halls of the building using his M60 and mows down all the men. He then loads a grenade on his gun and fires at Radek, blowing him up. Ransom then leaves the building, but he finds that Jakoda is back and that he has got a pair of metal teeth from their last fight. Jakoda tackles Ransom, but Ransom puts a grenade in Jakoda's mouth; Ransom runs and Jakoda explodes, leaving only his metal teeth behind and the echo of Jadoka screaming, Amerikanski!.

He was a Polish engineer of Jewish origin, who studied in Poland and France. From 1935 until his death he worked in Moscow. He was the first person to describe the bi-elliptic transfer technique of changing orbits, in 1934. In 1934, Sternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch (later known as the Prix d'Astronautique) of the French Astronomical Society for his book Initiation √† la Cosmonautique.l'Astronomie, 1934, p. 325‚Äì326. He is thus credited with introducing the word cosmonautics in the language of science and engineering.  Early life  Ary Abramovich Sternfeld was born 14 May 1905 in the city of Sieradz in Poland, then in Kalisz Governorate of Russian Empire, near Lodzi, in a merchant family. He had three sisters. From a young age he displayed wonderful memory, a godlike imagination and a sharp mind. He was still a child when he considered a trip to the moon, when he saw the moon return to a crescent at the start of the month and prayed with his father that the moon would remain unobtainable to enemies, but wondered why it was unobtainable. He considered flying through space. The implementation of his dream -the day would come when flying through space would go from a fantasy to reality-gave him life. When World War One broke out, the family moved to Lodzi. Here, Ary attended a Jewish Gymnasium. In school his first ideas about implementing spaceflight appeared. It was advisable to use a rocket with fuel onboard. He later had another idea to send a rocket from the sun, using the heat. At 17, he read in German Einstein's monograph about relativity. He did not understand a lot of it. He decided to write to Einstein with his questions. Afterwards, he developed his theories on cosmonautics.  Student years  After graduating from the gymnasium, Ari entered the school of philosophy at Jagiellonian University in Krakow. He finished the curriculum in spring 1924. He left for France, in order to have the means to study not just natural science, but also engineering. He enrolled in √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'√©lectricit√© et de m√©canique L‚ÄôENSEM in Nancy. He struggled during the first year. He needed to earn a living and support his impoverished parents. For several months until the school year started, he worked all day, starting in the famous Parisian market The Belly of Paris, later in the day in the factory Reno, and he did not have the means to learn French so he worked among immigrants. Thus when school started he did not understand French, the language of the lectures. He lived in poverty. When the money from summer work was not enough, he worked early in the morning controlling gas counters. Despite the daily struggle, he was cheerful, sociable, curious and successfully entered his second year. In the summer he worked for the car company Omer Samyn in Paris and when classes resumed, he resumed his old job. During this time, he continued to consider flying in space. This was not an abstract dream, but concrete calculations that he implemented. He later wrote, \\"My colleagues, the dreams and schemes that I plotted between lectures seemed to me incurable fantasies...in those days, to fly across the Atlantic Ocean became a sensation, and here to possess the power to control the universe...\\" After three years of selfless labour and tireless study, he became an engineer.  Paris and the Sorbonne  As an engineer, Sternfeld returned to Paris. He worked as a technologist, designer and consultant for various technological enterprises. He obtained a few patents. In the apartment where he lived, they jokingly nicknamed him \\"Banker\\". Students and new engineers take a long time and Sternfeld, already needing testing, needed to return. He began to settle down so that he could focus on his favourite work: the comprehensive study of spaceflight. In 1928 Sternfeld studied for a doctorate in Sorbonne in order to work on a dissertation about spaceflight. He went to the Central Research Institute in Paris in order to collect research for his dissertation, only to find that the studies he was looking for existed \\"nowhere\\", according to the people there of whom he asked for help. Many times he conducted research in the National Library of France. There he collected materials on the history and technology of rocketry, questions about flight mechanics, and calculated the trajectories of machines in space. In 1931, when all was said and done for Sternfeld's dissertation, his advisor stated that he would not be responsible for a research topic so far removed from reality. The advisor requested that he change the topic for an elevated stipend, but no Earthly good could stop Sternfeld from perusing his childhood dream. He decided to continue the thesis at his own risk. During this time, he met his future wife Gustava Erlich. Like Ary, Gustava came from Lodzi in 1924. She was an active and captivated person. She had been chosen to work as a secretary for the Polish department of a French company, and was an Esperantist. In Sorbonne, she was working on two degrees in child development and teaching French to foreigners. She ultimately edited his scientific work in French, Russian, Polish, German and Yiddish.  Tsiolkovsky's penpal  While working on his dissertation, Sternfeld found out about Tsiolkovsky's work in 1929 in the German rocketry journal \\"Die Raket\\". In this time, Sternfeld did not know Russian and Tsiolkovsky only worked in Russian, so he studied Russian. The first book that he read in Russian was Tsiolkovsky's Plan of Space Exploration (–ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤ —Ä–µ–∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–±–æ—Ä–∞–º–∏). It was impossible to get Tsiolkovsky's work in Paris, since no library in France had it. 11 June 1930 Sternfeld wrote a letter to Tsiolkovsky with a request to send his work. They wrote letters to each other in friendship until Tsiolkovsky died. 19 August 1930 the French magazine L‚ÄôHumanit√© published Sternfeld's article \\"From Yesterday's Utopia to Today's Realiy\\". In this article, he wrote about Tsiolkovsky's priorities and put in a picture that Tsiolkovsky had given him for the article. In the next few years, Sternfeld mentioned Tsiolkovsky in his publications. The book that Tsiolkovsky sent him ended up in Paris' National Library.  Introduction to cosmonautics In order to continue his research, Sternfeld returned to his parents in Lodzi in 1932. He worked in a dim room. It was necessary to do a lot of calculations. He did not have electronics like he did in Paris. Still, he wrote many scientific papers. He wrote in French the monograph \\"Introduction to Cosmonautics\\" (Initiation √† la Cosmonautique). The word \\"cosmonautics\\" had previously not existed in neither French nor Russian. He introduced this as a combination of the terms \\"astronautics\\" and \\"star navigation\\". Here he stated the combined problems of communication and conquest of space. He worked on many problems. \\"This was the first systematic summary of the population of the problems in communication with the upcoming conquest of space, from the building of the solar system to the relativistic effects on spaceflight.\\" He reported the investigation back to Warsaw University 6 December 1933. However, spaceflight continued to seem like fantasy.  French Academy of Science  Once again, Sternfeld returned to Paris. There he continued research. On 22 January 1934 Sternfeld was accepted into the French Academy of Science. During this time, he received articles from Herman Oberth and Walter Hohmann. He worked with the French cosmonauticist Robert Esnault-Pelterie.  USSR  In 1932 Sternfeld moved to Moscow to work on an android. Here, he made copies of his \\"Introduction to Cosmonautics\\". Starting in 1935, he worked for RNII (Institute of Reactive Scientific Research [–†–µ–∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ-–∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç–∞]). Here, he worked with Korolyov, along with other young, talented engineers: Glushko, Tikhonravov, Pobedonostsev. The chief engineer was Langemak, a rocketry pioneer who went on to design Katyusha. He translated \\"Introduction to Cosmonautics\\" into Russian. By the end of the 1930s, the government had repressed many of the workers at RNII. Sternfeld was not repressed, but he was dismissed from the inStitute in 1937. Over the next few years, Sternfeld worked in cosmonautics for the USSR Academy of Sciences. In the beginning years of World War Two, the Sternfeld's two daughters were born. In June 1941 Sternfeld wrote a letter of request to join the Red Army, but they denied his request. Instead, the family went to the city of Serov in the Urals. Here, Ary taught physics, material science, design and machinery, while Gustava taught German. After the war, Ary continued to write about cosmonautics, into the space era. He died in Moscow, Russia.

The All-Albanian Congress or Albanian National Congress or Albanian Independence Congress was a held in Vlor√´ (then Ottoman Empire, today Republic of Albania) on November 28, 1912. Congress participants constituted the Assembly of Vlor√´ which established Albanian Provisional Government and elected Ismail Qemali as its president.  Background  The success of the Albanian Revolt of 1912 sent a strong signal to the neighboring countries that the Ottoman Empire was weak. The Kingdom of Serbia opposed the plan for an Albanian Vilayet, preferring a partition of the European territory of the Ottoman Empire among the four Balkan allies. Balkan allies planned the partition of the European territory of the Ottoman Empire among them and in the meantime the conquered territory was agreed to have status of the Condominium. The combined armies of the Balkan allies overcame the numerically inferior and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies, and achieved rapid success. As a result of their success, almost all remaining European territories of the Ottoman Empire were captured by Balkan allies, which destroyed the plans for Albanian autonomy and independence. About two weeks before the congress was held, Albanian leaders appealed to Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria-Hungary, explaining the difficult situation in their country divided into four vilayets occupied by Balkan allies. Austria-Hungary and Italy strongly opposed the arrival of Serbian army on the Adriatic Sea because they perceived it as treat to their domination of the Adriatic and feared that Serbian Adriatic port could become a Russian base.  The sitting of the congress  Ismail Qemali and his cabinet during the celebration of the first anniversary of independence in Vlor√´ on 28 November 1913. When Ismail Qemali came to Albania in third week of November 1912, he discussed the future of the Albanian people with present participants of the congress. Although there was consensus for complete independence, they were also for friendly relation with the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, they sent telegrams to the Ottoman Western army, Vardar army and to Ioannina fortress pledging continued support for the war against the Christian states. On November 28, 1912, the congress' first sitting was held in the house of Xhemil bey in Vlor√´. Qemali invited Albanians from all four vilayets (Kosovo, Scutari, Monastir and Janina) within projected Albanian Vilayet to attend the congress. At the beginning of the session, Ismail Qemali took the floor and, referring to the threats to the rights Albanians had gained through successful revolts since 1908, proclaimed to the delegates that they should do anything necessary to save Albania. = Present participants of the congress = After Qemali's speech they began by reviewing delegates' credentials. The delegates were as follows: *Berati:Ilias Bey Vrioni, Hajredin bey Cakrani, Xhelal bey Skrapari, Jorgji Karbunara, Taq Tutulani, Sami Bey Vrioni (still awaited); *Dibra: Myfti Vehbi Dibra, Sherif Lengu; *Durr√´si: Abaz Efendi √áelkupa, Mustafa Ag√´ Hanxhiu, Jahja Ballhysa, Dom Nikoll√´ Ka√ßorri; *Elbasani: Lef Nosi, Shefqet bej Daiu, Qemal bej Karaosmani, Dervish bej Bi√ßaku; *Gjirokastra (by telegram): Elmaz Bo√ße, Veli Harxhi, Azis Efendi *Peja (ƒêakovica, Plav and Gusinje): Rexhep Mitrovica, Bedri bej Ipeku and Salih Gjuka *Kruja:Abdi bej Toptani, Mustafa Asim Efendi *Lushnja: Qemal bej Mullai, Ferit bej Vokopola, Nebi Efendi Sefa; *Ohrid and Struga: Zyhdi bej Ohri, Dr. H.

Albanians from several provinces had not yet reached Vlora when it was decided to start the first session of the congress. Ismail Qemali refused to wait for Isa Boletini and other Albanians from Kosovo Vilayet and hastily made the Albanian declaration of independence. The southern elite wanted to prevent Boletini's plans to assert himself as a key political figure and used him to suit their military needs.

Qemali's proposal was unanimously accepted and it was decided to constitute the Assembly of Vlor√´ () and to sign the declaration of independence of Albania. By signing the declaration of Albanian independence the present deputies of the Assembly of Vlor√´ rejected the autonomy granted by the Ottoman Empire to the Albanian Vilayet, projected a couple of months earlier. The consensus was made for the complete independence. The sitting was then suspended and members of newly constituted National Assembly went to the house of Ismail Qemali and raised the flag of Skanderbeg on the balcony of his house, in front of the gathered people.  Aftermath  The members of the newly constituted National Assembly returned from the balcony of Qemali's house and started the sitting of Assembly. They established the Provisional Government of Albania with Ismail Qemali as President who has the mandate to establish the Cabinet on the session of the Assembly of Vlor√´ held on December 4, 1912.

History In World War II, Los Angeles Harbor Defenses included posts on some islands of Southern California, e.g. in March 1942, \\"a 200-man Army detachment set up two radar stations\\" on San Clemente Island, and in March 1944, Navy \\"Seabees built two permanent radar installations on the island.\\" (transcribed at =USAF radar station= San Clemente Island Air Force Station was Permanent System radar station LP-39 which began operations in November 1951 with an AN/TPS-1C general surveillance radar. Designated as one of two offshore radar stations at the Southern California coast, the 670th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at the station on 1 February 1952 by the 27th Air Division. As an AC&W; radar station, the facility provided radar tracks for a Manual Air Defense Control Center to direct Ground control interception (GCI) of unidentified aircraft. The Air Force Station was upgraded to designation P-39 with a single AN/FPS-3 radar in May 1952 and an AN/FPS-4 height-finding radar the following year. In 1955 an AN/FPS-8 was added and subsequently converted to an AN/GPS-3 and in 1956, an AN/FPS-6 height-finder replaced the AN/FPS-4. As with other Air Defense Command stations replaced by facilities of the joint-use site system (JUSS), San Clemente Island AFS was replaced in 1960, and 670th operations moved to the JUSS RP-39 station at San Pedro Hill AFS with barracks at Fort MacArthur near the Project Nike direction center (part of the Los Angeles Air Defense Area). In 1960, San Clemente Island transferred to the Navy and the USAF operations building was subsequently used as a Navy photo lab (the AFS site is vacant, deteriorating and difficult to reach.) =USGS radar station= In 1966 (July 30-August 9), field activity D-4-66-SC of the United States Geological Survey in the Coastal and Marine Geology Program used San Clemente Island with a Western Electric M-33 radar for a study of the Bathymetry and Structure of San Clemente Island (e.g., the \\"CURV vehicle of Naval Undersea Research and Development Center, was...used for seafloor sampling.\\") (abstract retrieved 2013-03-22) =Mount Thirst radar station= In 1972 south of the former AFS, the Navy installed an AN/FPS-20 general surveillance radar at Mount Thirst (). The FPS-20 was later modified to an AN/FPS-93A in an Arctic Tower for range safety and bombing exercises. Joint Surveillance System In the late 1990s, an Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR-4) radar at Mount Thirst replaced the AN/FPS-93A, and is now shared with the Air Force for the JSS program (the FAA maintains the radar for the Navy, but reportedly does not use the data). =Station Tombstone= The late 1980s Station Tombstone Radar, an AN/SPS-73 surface search radar, is located north of Mt.

Its stocks and bonds were unattractive to investors, and several of its member shipyards were overvalued, conditions which brought down the company less than a year after it was formed in 1902. The company was replaced by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1904. At the turn of the 20th century, John Willard Young, a son of Mormon pioneer Brigham Young,\\" Young‚Äôs Suit Reopens Shipbuilding Tangle,\\" New York Times, 1905-03-04.Henry Wysham Lanier, \\"One Trust and What Became of It,\\" The World's Work, Vol. VII, p. 4445 (Feb. 1904). promoted the idea that many leading American shipbuilding companies should form one gigantic combination.L. Walter Sammis, \\"The Relation of Trust Companies to Industrial Combinations, as Illustrated by the United States Shipbuilding Company,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science Vol. 24, p. 241 (1904). The United States Shipbuilding Company was the manifestation of that idea.Robert Hessen, \\"Steel Titan: The Life of Charles M. Schwab,\\" 145-62 (1990) (\\"The U.S. Shipbuilding Company Scandal\\"), . Following this course, the enterprise's central designing office would apportion the shipbuilding work to the yard best suited to handle the project, therefore increasing competition with European shipyards.\\"Ship-Yard Trust Launched To- Day,\\" New York World, 1902-06-11, at 3. Although American shipbuilding was not considered a highly profitable venture,Arthur Stone Dewing, \\"Promotions and Reorganizations,\\" Vol 10 ch. XVII at p. 464 (Harvard Univ. 1914). the political environment seemed right for improvement. President William McKinley and his new Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, had endorsed federal subsidies for American shipbuilding industries, to compensate for the subsidies provided by European governments, but Congress had not yet approved such a measure.Marguerite Miller McKee, \\"The Ship Subsidy Question in American Politics,\\" pp. 50-51 (1922). A renowned naval architect and public servant, Lewis Nixon, was chosen to lead the venture, and helped attract several major shipyards to participate. Unfortunately, however, \\"the one thing [the consolidated firms] lacked, individually and collectively, was a realistic prospect of earning sustained profits.\\" Financially the corporation failed almost immediately. As one scholar would later write of this plan, \\"the theory was impossible; the condition was untenable; the trust, as it was manufactured, was impracticable; and the United States Shipbuilding Company was insolvent.\\" Groundwork Lewis Nixon Young first obtained an option to purchase the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (of Newport News, Virginia), then approached Nixon, who was then the lessor of the Crescent Shipyard in Elizabethport, New Jersey. Nixon agreed to work with Young in forming the proposed combination, and granted him an option on his own plant. They then obtained options to purchase other shipbuilding companies. Working with a cotton industry bank known as the Trust Company of the Republic, they sought out underwriters, and planned to issue stock and sell bonds, in order to provide the funds to buy the plants and then operate them at a profit. An initial prospectus was prepared for issue on May 7, 1901, but the actual issuance was withheld at the last moment because of what became known as the Northern Pacific \\"short squeeze\\" of 1901, a panic that occurred on that date. A news dispatch of that date described the proposed combination.May 7, 1901 dispatch, reprinted in \\"Ship Trust Sure: Capital of New Corporation $65,000,000 and Hydes on Board of Directors\\" Bath (ME) Independent, 1901-05-11 at 2. It described a combination that would include Union Iron Works (of San Francisco), Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine, Hyde Windlass Co. (also of Bath), Crescent Shipyard, Samuel J. Moore & Sons Co. of Elizabethport, New Jersey, Canda Manufacturing Co. of Carteret, New Jersey, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. All but Canda Manufacturing were shipyards, and Canda (which manufactured car wheels) reportedly owned a prime location near Staten Island for construction of a new shipyard. Three months later, it was again announced (again prematurely) that the new corporation would be launched in a few days. This time, British arms manufacturer Vickers Sons & Maxim, which had acquired the William Cramp & Sons shipyard in Philadelphia,\\"Cramps to Consolidate with English Firm,\\" New York Times, 1901-02-15. and the Bethlehem Ship & Armor Plate works were included on the published list of interests included in the corporation.\\"Great Shipyard Combine,\\" Adrian (MI) Daily Telegram, 1901-08-10 at p. 7. Ultimately, Vickers stayed out of the venture. In September 1901, while the USSC was still just a concept, Roosevelt replaced the assassinated President McKinley. Roosevelt had crusaded against trusts, and his elevation created a hostile environment toward formation of combinations like USSC, marked by the Department of Justice's suit in February 1902 to prevent the formation of the Northern Securities Company railroad trust. Meanwhile, federal shipyard subsidy legislation stalled in Congress.\\"Mr. Vest Denounces the Shipping Bill,\\" New York Times, 1902-03-11. The 1902 rollout Charles M. Schwab By the time that a prospectus for USSC was formally issued in June 1902, Newport News and Vickers Sons & Maxim were no longer listed as participating interests, but Harlan & Hollingsworth Co. of Wilmington, Delaware, and Eastern Shipbuilding Company of New London, Connecticut were now included.\\"The Shipyard Combine,\\" New York Times, 1902-06-11 at p. 1. The June 1902 prospectus stated, among other things, that the USSC had been organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey and described as its directors Nixon, Henry T. Scott (president of Union Iron Works), Charles J. Canda (president of Canda Manufacturing Co.), John S. Hyde (president of Hyde Windlass Co.), E. W. Hyde (president of Bath Iron Works), and Irving M. Scott (Vice President and General Manager of Union Iron Works). In fact, incorporation had not yet occurred, and the board had not yet been constituted. Once the company was organized several months later, only four of those mentioned in the prospectus as directors ever served as directors. The prospectus also stated that the plants were earning $2.25 million for a year and had abundant facilities for additional work and increased earnings. Even with positive representations in the prospectus, however, the public purchased less than $500,000 of the $9 million in bonds offered for sale, and foreign underwriters offered no cash, only promises (that were ultimately never honored). Eager to make the USSC more attractive to investors but facing a huge shortfall in funds, the promoters turned to Charles M. Schwab, then president of United States Steel, to discuss USSC acquiring Bethlehem Steel Company (which at the time was more sound than the shipyards already in the combination). With little cash to offer for Bethlehem (then held by a J.P. Morgan syndicate), the promoters instead proposed to pay for the acquisition with $7.2 million in cash and $2.5 million in USSC stock issued against the plants themselves. The cash came from Schwab, who furnished it on conditions that were highly favorable to him. By bringing Bethlehem into the combination, however, USSC could send a message to potential investors that Morgan was now behind the overall venture, and claim to be the world's only company capable of building a battleship complete with armament, armor and all equipment.\\"Shipyard Trust Buys Bethlehem Steel,\\" New York Times, 1902-06-15. In August 1902 USSC purchased the Union, Bath, Hyde Windlass, Crescent, Moore, Eastern, Harlan & Hollingsworth shipyards, the Canda Manufacturing company, and the capital stock of Bethlehem Steel. The par value of these transactions totaled $69.5 million ‚Äì yet (with the exception of Bethlehem Steel) the total value of the companies was appraised at less than $12.5 million. It soon became clear that the Bath, Crescent, Moore, Eastern, and Harlan & Hollingsworth shipyards were deeply indebted, and that the new trust lacked the ability to meet charges arising from the bond issuance. The goal of organizing a huge trust had been accomplished, but the result was doomed to fail, because from the start it was \\"already a water-logged wreck.\\" The promoters were immediately forced to personally borrow $1.5 million from New York banks, to make up for cash that never arrived from foreign subscribers. USSC's problems brought down the Trust Company of the Republic, which had placed its own future on the line when arranging USSC's financing, by purchasing the largest share of bonds. In September 1902, when Young was in France in a futile attempt to convince subscribers to invest, Ann Pulitzer, a former prostitute, was murdered in his New York apartment. His son William Hooper Young, who had been living there, eventually pleaded guilty to second- degree murder.\\"\\"Young Admits His Guilt,\\" New York Times, 1903-02-10, p. 5. Prosecutors accepted the plea and dropped first-degree murder charges because of evidence that Hooper Young was mentally ill. The collapse Schwab took control of USSC within a year of its incorporation,\\"Plan to Reorganize Shipyard Combine,\\"New York Times, 1903-05-28. but USSC's mortgageholders soon forced it into receivership. A federal court appointed former U.S. Senator James Smith Jr. as the receiver.\\"Ex-Senator Smith Shipyard Receiver,\\" New York Times, 1903-07-02. The company was replaced by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, in 1904.Robert T. Swaine, \\"The Cravath firm and its predecessors, 1819-1947,\\" Volume 1 p. 703 (1948).

By then, Nixon had re-entered the shipbuilding business by leasing a yard in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.\\"Lewis Nixon Leases Ship Plant,\\" New York Times, 1904-07-30 at p. 1. In 1905 John S. Hyde, son of the founder of the Bath Iron Works, purchased the Iron Works and Hyde Windlass Co. from the surviving company, which had bought the companies out of the receivership.General Dynamics ‚Äì Bath Iron Works ‚Äì Company Overview ‚Äì History, accessed 2011-01-22. It flourished as a supplier of major ships to the U.S. Navy. Bethlehem Shipbuilding and Steel repurchased and kept for itself the Union Iron Works in San Francisco and the Harlan & Hollingsworth Co. shipyard in Delaware (and began purchasing other shipyards). The name of the Delaware operation changed from Harlan & Hollingsworth to the Harlan Plant of Bethlehem Steel. That shipyard closed in 1926, although it was reopened for a time during the Second World War and part of the shipyard was used by the Dravo Corporation until 1964. Litigation arising from USSC's collapse continued for many years, as various victims sought relief against alleged wrongdoers.\\"Settle With Mrs. Wood in Shipbuilder‚Äôs Suit,\\" New York Times, 1905-03-01.

Gould, 223 N.Y. 103, 119 N.E. 237 (N.Y. 1918). On remand, the court ruled against Gould, and entered a $723,583 judgment against him in September 1919.\\"G.J.

Curatola is the founder of Rejuvenation Dentistry, a wellness-focused global network of dental practices, and the co-inventor and co-developer of REVITIN Oral Therapy. Early life and education Gerald Peter Curatola was born on November 10, 1957 in New York City to Italian American parents, Vincent James Curatola and Mildred Theresa Muccitelli. His father, Vincent, was the son of Italian immigrants, Dominic and Antoinette Curatola from Calabria, Italy. His mother, Mildred, was the daughter of Italian immigrants, Gerardo and Marion Muccitelli, from Rome and Bari, Italy. Curatola is second of three children of Vincent and Mildred, having an older brother and younger sister. He grew up in North Woodmere, New York, on Long Island after the family moved from Ozone Park, New York, in 1962. Curatola attended Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York, a private boy's Catholic preparatory school where he graduated as the President of his class in 1975. He went on to Colgate University in Hamilton, New York, graduating in 1979, majoring in Neuroscience, a topical concentration in Biology and Psychology.http://www.colgate.edu/docs/default- source/default-document-library/1979_071113.pdf Curatola began dental school in the fall of 1979 at New York University College of Dentistry and served as President of his dental school class until becoming the NYUCD Student Body President in his last year until his graduation in 1983. Curatola has been a member of the teaching faculty at NYU since 1984 serving as a Clinical Instructor in Dental Materials and presently, Clinical Associate Professor in the Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care. Early career In 1982, while in dental school, Curatola organized a dental mission to the island of Jamaica in conjunction with the Ministry of Health in the Jamaican Government and the U.S. Peace Corps, whose facilities were used on the island to provide dental care in critically under served areas for three months. His work there earned him recognition and a citation from the Jamaican Government.https://dental.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyudental/documents/Nexus_S2008.pdf After graduating from NYU with his D.D.S. degree in 1983, Curatola continued to perform pro bono dentistry to the Bowery Mission in New York City while building his own dental practice with a special interest in the emerging field of Cosmetic Dentistry. By 1985, his cosmetic dentistry work was published in the New York State Dental Journal and garnered the attention of the DenMat Corporation in Santa Maria, CA who hired him as a national lecturing clinician. In addition to serving as an Assistant Attending in Dentistry at Cabrini Medical Center, Curatola returned to NYU to join the teaching faculty at the College of Dentistry. Around this time, Curatola's interest in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) led him to pursue a Masters program in Nutrition and Wellness with former NYU classmate and future business partner, Dr. David Shuch, being given at the Pratt Institute in New York City. One of the earliest programs of its time, the program was designed by Integrative Nutrition pioneer, Dr. Alan Pressman, and assembled some of the leading minds in nutrition and wellness such as radio personality, Gary Null, Ph.D.. Curatola continued to lecture on cosmetic dentistry while privately researching alternative formulations to better promote oral health. In 1991, he founded the Curatola Dental Group, a general and cosmetic dentistry practice in midtown Manhattan, New York. In 1995, Curatola continued his education in natural medicine, attending Harvard University's Symposiums in Complementary and Alternative Medicine under the direction of Dr. David Eisenberg, the founder of Harvard Medical School's Center for Alternative Medicine Research and Education (now the Division for Research and Education in Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies of Harvard's Osher Research Center). =Rejuvenation Dentistry= Curatola founded Rejuvenation Dentistry in 2005.

For the later regulations that came into force on 6th April 2012, see Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 came into force in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2006 and brought together a number of other asbestos related pieces of legislation.HSE  The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 The pieces of legislation the regulations revoked and replaced were the 'Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002', the 'Asbestos (Licensing) Regulations 1983' and the 'Asbestos (Prohibitions) Regulations 1992'.Legislation.gov.uk  The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 Key elements of the regulations include a greater emphasis on training requiring anyone who may come into contact with Asbestos in the course of their work to be given suitable training. Greater restrictions were also placed on the amount of exposure workers could be exposed to in the form of 'control limits'. The recently published 'Asbestos: The survey guide' (HSG264) is complementary to these regulations. When work with asbestos is being carried out the Regulations place a requirement on employers and self-employed workers to prevent exposure to asbestos fibres. Duties arising from the regulations The Control of Asbestos 2006 regulations brought together three separate pieces of legislation which covered the prohibition of Asbestos, the control of asbestos at work and asbestos licensing. They prohibit the import, supply and use of all types of asbestos and also continue to ban the second hand use of asbestos products such as asbestos boards and tiles. The regulations require mandatory training to be given to anyone who may be exposed to asbestos whilst at work. This regulation will enable contracted workers on site to assess correctly the nature of a material before work is carried out, thus eliminating the risk of uncontrolled damage to Asbestos Containing Materials. Maintenance workers who may be coming onto a premises to carry out a job must also be given training.HSE  Asbestos regulations Should work need to be carried out that may result in the disturbing of asbestos then all measures should be taken to limit the exposure to asbestos fibres. Any exposure to those fibres should be below the 'airborne exposure limit' of 0.1 fibres per cm¬≥. The control limit is the maximum concentration of asbestos fibres in the air if measured over any continuous 4 hour period. Any short term exposure to asbestos, as measured by continuous exposure over 10 minutes, should not exceed 0.6 fibres per cm¬≥. These exposures must be strictly controlled with respiratory protective equipment if exposure can be reduced in no other way. In terms of asbestos removal, any work should be carried out by a licensed contractor although any decision as to whether work is 'licensable' is based on the risk. Anyone working on asbestos under the regulations must have a license issued by the Health and Safety Executive.HSE Web Site - Control of Asbestos Regulations There are a number of exceptions to whether work is licensable. These usually apply if it is clear from the risk assessment that any exposure will not exceed the control limit and the work is short and non-continuous; the work is to do with the sealing of asbestos containing materials and the material is in a good condition; air monitoring and control as in the collection of samples to determine whether a particular product contains asbestos. Prosecutions arising from the regulations On 9 June 2009 a company in Swansea, Val Inco Europe Ltd, pleaded guilty to four charges under the Control of Asbestos Regulations and were fined ¬£12,000 and ordered to pay ¬£28,000 costs. The charges were in relation to work carried out by a contractor, A-Weld, on a furnace at the companies premises. Although asbestos surveys had been carried out on their site, the interior of the plant and equipment had not been surveyed. As a result, asbestos insulation material was disturbed and broken potentially giving rise to powders and fibres. Workers on the site also discovered a 'white material' which they believed to be asbestos and although the sample was sent away for tests, the site was not isolated and the work was allowed to continue. HSE principal inspector Andrew Knowles said that an \\"important aspect was the failure to provide asbestos awareness training for employees, which is a specific requirement where asbestos may be present in a workplace\\". He added \\"The failures in this case were entirely preventable and the defendant fell far short of the high standards required. This should serve as a warning to others about the dangers of asbestos and the legal requirement to manage it properly.\\" Asbestos and associated health risks Asbestos is a naturally occurring group of silicate minerals that can readily be separated into thin strong fibres that are flexible, heat resistant and chemically inert. Within the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world, asbestos was used extensively as a building material from the 1950s to the 1980s. It was used as a means of fireproofing as well as insulation and any building built before 2000 could contain asbestos. Although Asbestos can be safe if the material is kept in good condition and undisturbed, if damaged asbestos fibres could become airborne and cause serious risks to health if inhaled. Serious diseases including mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis could result if someone were to breathe in high levels of asbestos fibres. A particular risk if someone were to be working either on, or with, asbestos materials which had been damaged.HSE  why is asbestos dangerous? There are six forms of Asbestos although only three are commonly used, these are Chrysotile (white asbestos), the most common; Amosite (brown asbestos) which can often be found in ceiling tiles and as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products; Crocidolite (blue asbestos), commonly used in high temperature applications.Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources  Asbestos - History and Uses Notes References Category:Health and safety in the United Kingdom Category:Safety codes Category:Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom Category:2006 in British law Category:Asbestos ","title":"Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006"},{"id":"30600548","text":"The Russell case, also called the Ampthill baby case, was a series of proceedings related to the conception of Geoffrey Russell. It covered two divorce cases and the claim to the British peerage title Baron Ampthill, and the possibility of a virgin birth. John Russell, the heir apparent to Oliver Russell, 2nd Baron Ampthill, married Christabel Hart in 1918. In 1921 Christabel discovered she was about five months pregnant. The couple had not fully consummated their marriage, though they had slept in the same bed in Oakley House for a night the preceding December. John sued for divorce on grounds of adultery, naming two co-respondents and one unknown. Christabel claimed she was a virgin and produced medical expert evidence that prior to the birth of Geoffrey in October 1921 she had an only partly perforated hymen. She also claimed that her husband had undertaken \\"Hunnish (that is to say Barbaric) scenes\\" and had attempted to rape her on the night in question, and that she had used a sponge he had previously used.Was mother a virgin?, TIME magazine 8 March 1976 In the initial divorce case Russell v. Russell in 1922, the two named co-respondents were acquitted while the case for the unnamed partner was inconclusive. In the second divorce case in 1923, Christabel was convicted of adultery and lost on appeal, but had the verdict overturned on further appeal to the House of Lords which ruled in 1924 that no child born after a marriage could be declared illegitimate merely on the testimony of his mother or father.Russell v. Russell [1924] AC 687 (HL) The scandal led to the enactment of the Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act 1926UK Statute Law Database to prevent detailed evidence in divorce cases appearing in newspapers. The couple remained separated, and were finally divorced after John had become 3rd Baron Ampthill in 1935. Lord Ampthill married secondly Sibell Faithfull Lumley, who died in 1947 without issue. Lord Ampthill then married, as his third wife, Adeline Hone in 1948, and they had two children: John in 1950 and Georgiana in 1952. John died in 1973 and the younger John challenged Geoffrey's right to inherit the Ampthill barony. In 1976, the House of Lords Committee For Privileges reported that the younger John had not made out his claim, so confirming Geoffrey as the 4th Baron Ampthill; Geoffrey's mother died while the case was under consideration.Barony of Ampthill HL Deb 27 April 1976 vol 370 cc6-23Inside story: Oakley House, Daily Telegraph 02 September 2000 References Category:Russell family Category:Scandals in England Category:Ampthill Category:Divorce law in the United Kingdom Category:1922 in British law Category:1976 in British law ","title":"Russell case"},{"id":"30600559","text":"The station and the tracks toward Pontoise Pierrelaye is a railway station in the town of Pierrelaye, a northwestern suburb of Paris, France.

Mount Laguna Air Force Station (ADC ID: P-76, NORAD ID: Z-76) is a closed United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station. It is located north-northeast of Tecate, California. It was closed in 1981 by the Air Force, and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-30. History Mount Laguna Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the United States Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 751st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was initially assigned to Mount Laguna by September 1951.Cornett & Johnson, p. 163 Within months the radar assumed coverage formerly provided by the Minter Field Lashup site (L-34). At that time the 751st AC&W; Squadron operated AN/CPS-4 and AN/FPS-3 radars, and initially the station functioned as a ground control intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. An AN/FPS-8 replaced the AN/CPS-4 in 1955. This radar then was converted to an AN/GPS-3 in 1956, and removed in 1960. 1956 also saw the arrival of an AN/FPS-6 at the site. During 1961 Mount Laguna AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-17 at Norton AFB, California. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 751st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 May 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. By 1962 the 751st operated an AN/FPS-7C search radar and AN/FPS-6 and 6B height-finder radars. In 1963 the -6B was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90 set. Mount Laguna AFS's site number changed to NORAD ID Z-76 on 31 July 1963. In 1964 the AN/FPS-6 was replaced by an AN/FPS-26A FD height-finder radar; this radar was converted to an AN/FSS-7 SLBM D&W; radar in 1966. Mt. Laguna became a joint-use ADC/FAA facility around 1965. In addition to the main facility, Mount Laguna Air Force Station operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Tecate, CA (P-76A) * San Ysidro, CA (P-76B) * Tierra del Sol, CA (P-76C) * Coyote Wells, CA (P-76D) * Moreno, CA (P-76E) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 751st Radar Sq was inactivated and replaced by the 751st Air Defense Group in March 1970.Cornett, & Johnson,p.86 The upgrade to group status was done because of Mount Laguna AFS' status as a Backup Interceptor Control (BUIC) site. BUIC sites were alternate control sites in the event that SAGE Direction Centers became disabled and unable to control interceptor aircraft. The group was inactivated and replaced by the 751st Radar Squadron. as defenses against manned bombers were reduced. The group was disbanded in 1984.Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 575q, 27 Sep 1984, Subject: Disbandment of Units In 1979 Mount Laguna came under Tactical Air Command (TAC) jurisdiction with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the creation of ADTAC. In the early 1980s the FAA assumed greater control, with the inactivation of the 751st Radar Squadron on 30 September 1981. The FAA replaced the AN/FPS-7E with an ARSR-3 search radar, leaving the Air Force only responsible for the height-finder tower (by then an AN/FPS-116), which was removed c. 1988. In the late 1990s, the ARSR-3 was replaced by the ARSR-4. Today Mount Laguna is an FAA site, tied into the Joint Surveillance System (JSS). The former Air Force Station has been abandoned since 1981, the facilities in disrepair. The buildings that once housed up to 400 Air Force personnel at Mount Laguna are now gutted shells covered with graffiti and filled with construction debris. For years, U.S. Forest Service officials have wanted to demolish the buildings at the abandoned base, but no money was available. In 2009, funds became available for site restoration and the barracks, administration building, mess hall and other buildings that made up the Laguna Mountain Air Force Base have been torn down using money from $18.2 million in stimulus funds for Forest Service facilities in disrepair in 14 California counties.

Written by Brent Forrester and directed by Michael Spiller, the episode aired February 3, 2011 on NBC. In the episode, Michael gets left behind at a gas station (when Jim leaves him to attend to CeCe) and starts wandering around Scranton, leaving Dwight, Erin, and Holly to look for him. Meanwhile, Pam starts a caption contest in the office, with Gabe instituting rules that no one wants to follow. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) continues to ask Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to get back together with him, but she continually refuses. Since she dated Michael when she worked in Scranton before and A. J. when she moved to Nashua, she feels like she does not want to fall into a pattern of dating co-workers. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is particularly concerned for Michael, not believing Holly is actually as great as Michael thinks she is. Michael and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) then go out on a sales call. After landing the sale, an irritable Michael needs to stop to use the bathroom. While at a gas station, Jim gets a call from Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) mother Helene (Linda Purl), who was taking a feverish Cece to see the doctor when she accidentally locked the child in the car. Panicked, Jim attempts in vain to tell Michael through the door of the bathroom, then tells another gas station customer to tell Michael what happened and drives off, but the customer leaves after only waiting for a few seconds. Michael is left with no way of contacting the office, as his cell phone and wallet are with Jim and he does not remember the office's number, so he wanders around Scranton, making stops at a pet store to talk to the animals, and a hot dog stand, where he attempts to pawn his watch in exchange for food. Jim, now with Cece, calls Pam and tells her Michael is at the gas station, so Holly, Erin, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) head there. Finding Michael has left the gas station, Dwight and Erin are rude to Holly, but when Dwight suggests that Michael walked back towards the office, Holly correctly guesses that he went in the direction of the bakery next door \\"just for the smell of it\\". After stopping at a grocery store to get some things for Pam, Dwight and Erin notice Holly changing cell phone services at a kiosk outside the store. They and the kiosk attendant are annoyed to discover that Holly used a joke name (Fanny Smellmore) to complete the forms in order to get a rubber stress ball, but when the attendant mentions that someone else had done the exact thing earlier, Dwight and Erin recognize a fake name that is used by Michael (Orville Tootenbacher). Believing that Holly can subconsciously determine where Michael has been, they follow her to a Chinese restaurant, where they find his picture on the wall along with others who have dined there without paying (Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) also being among them). Dwight demands Holly tell him where Michael is, but when she suggests that they find a high vantage point at which they can try to spot him, Dwight rejects this idea. While Dwight looks in a bowling alley, Holly heads up to the roof of a tall building to see if she can spot Michael from above. On the roof, she finds Michael who was similarly trying to spot the office from above. They both admit that they have missed each other and kiss. Erin, who opted to follow Holly instead of Dwight, walks in and is happy for Michael. Pam notices that several coworkers have written funny captions below her Sabre printer doodle on the refrigerator and gets the office to participate in a caption contest involving a cartoon of two dogs on a tropical island. Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) is upset that the captions insult Sabre, and implements a set of rules, stating that they cannot insult Sabre or even use pop culture references. The office instead uses instant messenger to share quips in secret. Gabe catches them and prints out the list of quips, which insult Sabre and even attack Gabe personally, and reads them to the office thinking this will shame the authors. Instead, they all laugh at each other's quips. The most popular ones involve Gabe being peed on and one of the dogs having had sex with Gabe's mother. Production This episode was written by consulting producer Brent Forrester, his first writing credit of the season and his ninth writing credit of the series. It was directed by Michael Spiller, his first directing credit for The Office. This was the third consecutive episode in which John Krasinski has a limited role in the episode as Jim, due to the filming of Big Miracle in Alaska.

Reptiles arose about 310‚Äì320 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. Reptiles, in the traditional sense of the term, are defined as animals that have scales or scutes, lay land-based hard-shelled eggs, and possess ectothermic metabolisms. So defined, the group is paraphyletic, excluding endothermic animals like birds and mammals that are descended from early reptiles. A definition in accordance with phylogenetic nomenclature, which rejects paraphyletic groups, includes birds while excluding mammals and their synapsid ancestors. So defined, Reptilia is identical to Sauropsida. Though few reptiles today are apex predators, many examples of apex reptiles have existed in the past. Reptiles have an extremely diverse evolutionary history that has led to biological successes, such as dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, and ichthyosaurs. First reptiles =Rise from water= paraphyletic group comprising all non-avian and non-mammalian amniotes. Reptiles first arose from amphibians in the swamps of the late Carboniferous(Early Pennsylvanian - Bashkirian ). Increasing evolutionary pressure and the vast untouched niches of the land powered the evolutionary changes in amphibians to gradually become more and more land-based. Environmental selection propelled the development of certain traits, such as a stronger skeletal structure, muscles, and more protective coating (scales) became more favorable; the basic foundation of reptiles were founded. The evolution of lungs and legs are the main transitional steps towards reptiles, but the development of hard-shelled external eggs replacing the amphibious water bound eggs is the defining feature of the class Reptilia and is what allowed these amphibians to fully leave water. Another major difference from amphibians is the increased brain size, more specifically, the enlarged cerebrum and cerebellum. Although their brain size is small when compared to birds and mammals, these enhancements prove vital in hunting strategies of reptiles. The increased size of these two regions of the brain allowed for improved motor skills and an increase in sensory development. =Early reptiles= An early reptile Hylonomus Mesozoic scene showing typical reptilian megafauna: the dinosaurs Europasaurus holgeri and Iguanodon, and the early bird Archaeopteryx perched on the foreground tree stump. The origin of the reptiles lies about 320‚Äì310 million years ago, in the swamps of the late Carboniferous period, when the first reptiles evolved from advanced reptiliomorph labyrinthodonts. (abstract) The oldest known animal that may have been an amniote, a reptile rather than an amphibian, is CasineriaMonastersky, R. (1999) Out of the Swamps, How early vertebrates established a foothold‚Äîwith all 10 toes‚Äîon land. Science News, Vol. 155, No. 21, p. 328. article (though it has also been argued to be a temnospondyl amphibian).Chapter 6: \\"Walking with early tetrapods: evolution of the postcranial skeleton and the phylogenetic affinities of the Temnospondyli (Vertebrata: Tetrapoda).\\" In: Kat Pawley (2006). \\"The postcranial skeleton of temnospondyls (Tetrapoda: temnospondyli).\\" PhD Thesis. La Trobe University, Melbourne. A series of footprints from the fossil strata of Nova Scotia, dated to 315 million years, show typical reptilian toes and imprints of scales. The tracks are attributed to Hylonomus, the oldest unquestionable reptile known. It was a small, lizard-like animal, about 20 to 30 cm (8‚Äì12 in) long, with numerous sharp teeth indicating an insectivorous diet. Other examples include Westlothiana (sometimes considered a reptiliomorph amphibian rather than a true amniote) and Paleothyris, both of similar build and presumably similar habit. One of the best known early reptiles is Mesosaurus, a genus from the Early Permian that had returned to water, feeding on fish. The earliest reptiles were largely overshadowed by bigger labyrinthodont amphibians, such as Cochleosaurus, and remained a small, inconspicuous part of the fauna until after the small ice age at the end of the Carboniferous. =Anapsids, synapsids, diapsids and sauropsids= A = Anapsid, B = Synapsid, C = Diapsid It was traditionally assumed that first reptiles were anapsids, having a solid skull with holes only for the nose, eyes, spinal cord, etc.;Romer, A.S. & T.S. Parsons. 1977. The Vertebrate Body. 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985) the discoveries of synapsid-like openings in the skull roof of the skulls of several members of Parareptilia, including lanthanosuchoids, millerettids, bolosaurids, some nycteroleterids, some procolophonoids and at least some mesosaurs made it more ambiguous and it is currently uncertain whether the ancestral reptile had an anapsid-like or synapsid-like skull. Very soon after the first reptiles appeared, they split into two branches. One branch, Synapsida (including modern mammals), had one opening in the skull roof behind each eye. The other branch, Sauropsida, is itself divided into two main groups. One of them, the aforementioned Parareptilia, contained taxa with anapsid-like skull, as well as taxa with one opening behind each eye (see above). Members of the other group, Diapsida, possessed a hole in their skulls behind each eye, along with a second hole located higher on the skull. The function of the holes in both synapsids and diapsids was to lighten the skull and give room for the jaw muscles to move, allowing for a more powerful bite. Turtles have been traditionally believed to be surviving anapsids, on the basis of their skull structure., 3rd ed. 2004 The rationale for this classification was disputed, with some arguing that turtles are diapsids that reverted to this primitive state in order to improve their armor (see Parareptilia). Later morphological phylogenetic studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly within Diapsida. All molecular studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within diapsids, most commonly as a sister group to extant archosaurs. =Mammalian evolution= A basic cladogram of the origin of mammals. Important developments in the transition from reptile to mammal were the evolution of warm-bloodedness, of molar occlusion, of the three-ossicle middle ear, of hair, and of mammary glands. By the end of the Triassic, there were many species that looked like modern mammals and, by the Middle Jurassic, the lineages leading to the three extant mammal groups -- the monotremes, the marsupials, and the placentals -- had diverged. Rise of dinosaurs =Permian reptiles= Near the end of the Carboniferous, while the terrestrial reptiliomorph labyrinthodonts were still present, the synapsids evolved the first fully terrestrial large vertebrates, the pelycosaurs such as Edaphosaurus. In the mid-Permian period, the climate turned drier, resulting in a change of fauna: The primitive pelycosaurs were replaced by the more advanced therapsids.Colbert, E.H. & Morales, M. (2001): Colbert's Evolution of the Vertebrates: A History of the Backboned Animals Through Time. 4th edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York ‚Äî . The anapsid reptiles, whose massive skull roofs had no postorbital holes, continued and flourished throughout the Permian. The pareiasaurs reached giant proportions in the late Permian, eventually disappearing at the close of the period. Late in the period, the diapsid reptiles split into two main lineages, the archosaurs (ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern tuataras, lizards, and snakes). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian. =The Mesozoic era, the \\"Age of Reptiles\\"= The close of the Permian saw the greatest mass extinction known (see the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event). Most of the earlier anapsid/synapsid megafauna disappeared, being replaced by the archosauromorph diapsids. The archosaurs were characterized by elongated hind legs and an erect pose, the early forms looking somewhat like long-legged crocodiles. The archosaurs became the dominant group during the Triassic period, developing into the well-known dinosaurs and pterosaurs, as well as the pseudosuchians. The Mesozoic is often called the \\"Age of Reptiles\\", a phrase coined by the early 19th-century paleontologist Gideon Mantell who recognized the dinosaurs and the ancestors of the crocodilians as the dominant land vertebrates. Some of the dinosaurs were the largest land animals ever to have lived while some of the smaller theropods gave rise to the first birds. The sister group to Archosauromorpha is Lepidosauromorpha, containing squamates and rhynchocephalians, as well as their fossil relatives. Lepidosauromorpha contained at least one major group of the Mesozoic sea reptiles: the mosasaurs, which emerged during the Cretaceous period. The phylogenetic placement of other main groups of fossil sea reptiles ‚Äì the sauropterygians and the ichthyosaurs, which evolved in the early Triassic and in the Middle Triassic respectively ‚Äì is more controversial. Different authors linked these groups either to lepidosauromorphsGauthier J. A. (1994): The diversification of the amniotes. In: D. R. Prothero and R. M. Schoch (ed.) Major Features of Vertebrate Evolution: 129-159. Knoxville, Tennessee: The Paleontological Society. or to archosauromorphs,http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G331/lectures/331vertsII.html and ichthyosaurs were also argued to be diapsids that did not belong to the least inclusive clade containing lepidosauromorphs and archosauromorphs. The therapsids came under increasing pressure from the dinosaurs in the Jurassic; the mammals and the tritylodontids were the only survivors of the line by the end of the period. =Bird evolution= An Archaeopteryx specimen in Berlin. The main points to the transition from reptile to bird are the evolution from scales to feathers, the evolution of the beak (although independently evolved in other organisms), the hallofication of bones, development of flight, and warm-bloodedness. The evolution of birds is thought to have begun in the Jurassic Period, with the earliest birds derived from theropod dinosaurs. Birds are categorized as a biological class, Aves. The earliest known species in Aves is Archaeopteryx lithographica, from the Late Jurassic period. Modern phylogenetics place birds in the dinosaur clade Theropoda. According to the current consensus, Aves and Crocodilia are the sole living members of an unranked clade, the Archosauria. Simplified cladogram from Senter (2007). =Demise of the dinosaurs= The close of the Cretaceous period saw the demise of the Mesozoic era reptilian megafauna. Along with massive amount of volcanic activity at the time, the meteor impact that created the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary is accepted as the main cause for this mass extinction event. Of the large marine reptiles, only sea turtles are left, and, of the dinosaurs, only the small feathered theropods survived in the form of birds. The end of the ‚ÄúAge of Reptiles‚Äù led to the ‚ÄúAge of Mammals‚Äù. Despite the change in phrasing, reptile diversification continued throughout the Cenozoic. Today, squamates make up the majority of extant reptiles today (over 90%). There are approximately 9,766 extant species of reptiles, compared with 5,400 species of mammals, so the number of reptilian species (without birds) is nearly twice the number of mammals. =Role reversal= After the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event wiped out all of the non-avian dinosaurs (birds are generally regarded as the surviving dinosaurs) and several mammalian groups, placental and marsupial mammals diversified into many new forms and ecological niches throughout the Paleogene and Neogene eras. Some reached enormous sizes and almost as wide a variation as the dinosaurs once did. Nevertheless, mammalian megafauna never quite reached the skyscraper heights of some sauropods. Nonetheless, large reptiles still composed important megafaunal components, such as giant tortoises, large crocodilians and, more locally, large varanids. The four orders of Reptilia =Testudines= Testudines, or turtles, may have evolved from anaspids, but their exact origin is unknown and heavily debated. Fossils date back to around 220 million years ago and share remarkably similar characteristics. These first turtles retain the same body plan as do all modern testudines and are mostly herbivorous, with some feeding exclusively on small marine organisms. The trade-mark shell is believed to have evolved from extensions from their backbone and widened ribs that fused together. This is supported by the fossil of Odontochelys semitestacea, which has an incomplete shell originating from the ribs and back bone. This species also had teeth with its beak, giving more support to it being a transitional fossil, although this claim is still controversial. This shell evolved to protect against predators, but also slows down the land-based species by a great amount. This has caused many species to go extinct in recent times. Because of alien species out-competing them for food and the inability to escape from humans, there are many endangered species in this order. =Sphenodontia= Sphenodontians arose in the mid Triassic and now consists of a single genus, tuatara, which comprises two endangered species that live on New Zealand and some of its minor surrounding islands. Their evolutionary history is filled with many species.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/10/1008_031008_sphenodontian.html Recent paleogenetic discoveries show that tuataras are prone to quick speciation. =Squamata= The most recent order of reptiles, squamates, are recognized by having a movable quadrate bone (giving them upper-jaw movement), possessing horny scales and hemipenes. They originate from the early Jurassic and are made up of the three suborders Lacertilia (paraphyletic), Serpentes, and Amphisbaenia. Although they are the most recent order, squamates contain more species than any of the other reptilian orders. Squamates are a monophyletic group included, with the Sphenodontia (e.g. tuataras), in the Lepidosauria. The latter superorder, together with some extinct animals like the plesiosaurs, constitute the Lepidosauromorpha, the sister infraclass to the group, the Archosauromorpha, that contains crocodiles, turtles, and birds. Although squamate fossils first appear in the early Jurassic, mitochondrial phylogenetics suggests that they evolved in the late Permian. Most evolutionary relationships within the squamates are not yet completely worked out, with the relationship of snakes to other groups being most problematic. From morphological data, Iguanid lizards have been thought to have diverged from other squamates very early, but recent molecular phylogenies, both from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, do not support this early divergence. Because snakes have a faster molecular clock than other squamates, and there are few early snake and snake ancestor fossils, it is difficult to resolve the relationship between snakes and other squamate groups. =Crocodilia= The first organisms that showed similar characteristics of Crocodilianshttp://crocodilian.com/ were the Crurotarsi, who appeared during the early Triassic 250 million years ago. This quickly gave rise to the Eusuchia clade 220 million years ago, which would eventually lead to the order of Crocodilians, the first of which arose about 85 million years ago during the late Cretaceous. The earliest fossil evidence of eusuchians is of the genus Isisfordia. Early species mainly fed on fish and vegetation. They were land-based, most having long legs (when compared to modern crocodiles) and many were bipedal. As diversification increased, many apex predators arose, all of which are now extinct. Modern Crocodilia arose through specific evolutionary traits. The complete loss of bipedalism was traded for a generally low quadrupedal stance for an easy and less noticeable entrance to bodies of water. The shape of the skull/jaw changed to allow more grasp along with upward-pointing nostrils and eyes. Mimicry is evident, as the backs of all crocodilia resemble some type of floating log and their general color scheme of brown and green mimics moss or wood. Their tail also took on a paddle shape to increase swimming speed. The only remaining groupshttps://www.diffen.com/difference/Alligator_vs_Crocodile of this order are the alligators and caimans; crocodiles; and gharials.

It is notable for being won by Elizabeth McCombs of the New Zealand Labour Party, who became the first woman to be elected to the New Zealand Parliament. This by-election was therefore seen as a milestone in Women's suffrage in New Zealand. Cause of by-election This by-election came about because of the death of James McCombs who was Elizabeth McCombs's husband. He had held the electorate of Lyttelton since he won it in the Lyttelton by-election of 1913. He was therefore one of the earliest members of the Labour party to hold an electorate. He died of a heart attack on 2 August 1933. Candidates and selection process =Labour Party= Despite the electorate of Lyttelton being held by Labour or its predecessor the Social Democrats since 1913, the electorate was seen as marginal as it had been won by just 32 votes at the 1931 general election. However, the Labour Party were confident of retaining the electorate as they pledged reforms that would help those affected by the Great Depression. The Labour party chose to select Elizabeth McCombs who had previously been elected to the Christchurch City Council in 1921 and had stood for Labour in Kaiapoi and then Christchurch North in the 1928 and the 1931 respectively. McCombs was unanimously selected as the Labour party candidate. Nine other women had stood for parliament in New Zealand since they had been allowed to in 1919, while women gained the right to vote in 1893. It was not uncommon for family members to take over parliamentary electorates upon the death of a family member. For example, Vincent Ward had taken over from his father Joseph in the Invercargill electorate in 1930. =Coalition Government= The United and Reform parties were at this stage in a coalition. The Christchurch executives unanimously suggested that Frederick W. Freeman be accepted as their candidate. He had already been the Reform party candidate in the 1931 general election, losing by just 32 votes against James McCombs. Minister of Finance and Acting Prime Minister Gordon Coates as leader of Reform, and the Minister of Lands, Alfred Ransom, on behalf of United, accepted the recommendation on behalf of the coalition and endorsed Freeman's selection. Freeman was born in Christchurch in 1881 and educated locally. After a term of legal work, he trained as a surveyor and later became a civil engineer. He was a commissioner of the Waimakariri River Trust and an elected member of the Heathcote County Council. He had held leading positions with the Canterbury Automobile Association, the South Island Motor Union, and had been a director for an insurance company. At the time of the by-election, he was an executive member of the Canterbury Progress League, a councillor for the Canterbury Chamber of Commerce, and a member of the Arthur's Pass National Park Board. =Independent= Edward L. Hills was described as the unknown factor prior to the by-election. A young man of considerable vitality, he was described as the best speaker of the three candidates. He was involved in trade unions in Christchurch and had been a member of the Labour Party, but he resigned on 1 August 1933 (the day before James McCombs' death) as the Woolston branch of Labour did not support his nomination for the selection ballot for the next general election. He thus contested the by-election as an Independent. Election campaign McCombs's campaign was dominated by the fact that she was a woman. She chose to address this issue head on by using \\"Vote the first woman to the New Zealand Parliament\\" as her campaign slogan. Although it appears that the major newspapers had few worries about electing a woman, many people did. The leader of the Labour Party, Harry Holland, attended some of the campaign meetings in support of McCombs. McCombs was received favourably at various meetings; many attendees were, unsurprisingly, women. Freeman received considerable support with his campaign from the coalition government. William Bodkin and Walter Broadfoot, United Party Members of Parliament representing the Otago Central and Waitomo electorates, respectively, were both present and campaigning on Hills' behalf. They were not received very favourably, though. One of Broadfoot's meetings in Lyttelton for women was attended by only five electors. A later meeting in the Labour stronghold of Woolston was much better frequented, with 200 attendees busy interjecting him during his speech. That meeting was concluded with a formal thanks to the speaker, and three cheers for McCombs. Bodkin had a more orderly meeting in Cashmere. Freeman himself was well received. At a meeting in St Martins, he addressed an audience of 50. A motion was passed to record \\"thanks and confidence\\", and an amendment to delete the word 'confidence' from the motion was defeated. Hills was reported as saying: \\"I believe the same as Hitler believes, that woman's place is in the home\\", and further that \\"I believe the difficulties of the country are too great for women to grapple with.\\" Many letter writers to the press were also unimpressed at the prospect of having a woman in parliament. Hills was criticised at election meetings that he would split the Labour vote. He was also asked whether he received money from somebody for standing in the election, insinuating that the conservative candidate might possibly have an interest in the vote of the working class being split. The election campaign was also seen as important because of the Great Depression that New Zealand was experiencing and was viewed to be a referendum on the government's response. Results A cartoon showing Forbes & Coates reacting in surprise at McCombs' victory. The results of the Lyttelton electorate at the 1931 general election were: Results of the by-election held on 13 September 1933 were: Elizabeth McCombs won 16 of the 23 polling places. Legacy \\"I am proud to be the first woman to be elected to our Parliament\\" McCombs said upon her victory. \\"It will be my endeavour to live up to the tradition the women of New Zealand have established for taking their full share of the burden of government.\\" Despite heavy rain, this speech was delivered in front of 2000 supporters in Cathedral Square. It is unclear how much bearing her being a woman had on her being elected given that the swing to her was similar to the swing to labour in the 1935 general election. Her time in parliament would however only last two years as she died on 7 June 1935 of ill health. Her electorate was taken over by her son Terry McCombs in the Lyttelton by-election of 1935. Elizabeth McCombs is still remembered today. New Zealand's first woman prime minister to gain her position at an election, Helen Clark, said: > \\"Elizabeth McCombs made history when she was elected as New Zealand's first > woman member of Parliament, New Zealand women had waited a long time for > that day. Her election came 40 years after women gained the right to vote. > As a Labour Prime Minister and leader of the New Zealand Labour Party, I am > very proud of Elizabeth McCombs' historic first. I see it as one of many > steps in the political progress of women in our country which made it > possible for me to become leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister.\\" While Ruth Dyson, who is the member of parliament for Port Hills, which includes the town of Lyttelton, said: > \\"She cracked one of the many glass ceilings and laid the groundwork for > women such as me to enter Parliament and represent our communities in a > compassionate and intelligent manner. Let us all remember Elizabeth McCombs, > for it is in her footsteps that many of us now tread.\\" Notes References * Lyttelton 1933 Category:1933 elections in New Zealand Category:Politics of Canterbury, New Zealand ","title":"1933 Lyttelton by-election"},{"id":"30601060","text":"Peter Hamerl√≠k (born 2 January 1982) is a Slovak ice hockey goaltender who is currently playing for Bratislava Capitals of the bet-at-home ICE Hockey League.

V. Davies (1982). \\"The Origin of the Blue Crown\\", The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 68, pp. 69-76 On the stela Dedumose claims to have been raised for kingship, which may indicate he is a son of Dedumose I, although the statement may also merely be a form of propaganda. The martial tone of the stela probably reflects the constant state of war of the final years of the 16th Dynasty, when the Hyksos invaded its territory:Ludwig Morenz and Lutz Popko: A companion to Ancient Egypt, vol 1, Alan B. Lloyd editor, Wiley-Blackwell, p. 106 Ludwig Morenz believes that the above excerpt of the stele, in particular \\"who is acclaimed to the kingship\\", may confirm the controversial idea of Eduard Meyer that certain pharaohs were elected to office. As Josephus' Timaios Dedumose is usually linked to Timaios, p. 185, p. 52 mentioned by the historian Josephus ‚Äì who was quoting Manetho ‚Äì as a king during whose reign an army of Asiatic foreigners subdued the country without a fight., I:75-77 The introductory phrase in Josephus' quotation of Manetho œÑŒøœÖ Œ§ŒπŒºŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ± appears somewhat ungrammatical and following A. von Gutschmid, the Greek words œÑŒøœÖ Œ§ŒπŒºŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ ([genitive definite article] Timaios [nominative]) is often combined into the proposed name Œ§ŒøœÖœÑŒπŒºŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ (Tutimaios) based on the tenuous argument of von Gutschmid that this sounded like Tutmes i.e. Thutmose. This has influenced the transliteration of the name Dedumose as Dudimose in order to reinforce the resemblance but this transliteration is not justified by the hieroglyphic spelling of the name. Nevertheless Dedumose did rule either as a Pharaoh of the 13th dynasty which preceded the Hyksos or as part of the 16th dynasty contemporaneous with the early Hyksos and the actual form Timaios in the manuscript of Josephus still plausibly represents his name. Whiston's translation of Josephus understands the phrase to mean ‚Äú[There was a king] of ours (œÑŒøœÖ), whose name was Timaus (Œ§ŒπŒºŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ±).\\" A. B√ºlow-Jacobsen has suggested however that the phrase in Josephus may have been derived via a series of (unattested) scribal errors from œÑŒøœÖ œÄœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ (\\"of the matter\\") and that ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ± (\\"this is a name\\", typically left out of translations) is a later gloss whence the original text of Josephus did not contain the name of a Pharaoh at all.Wolfgang Helck, Eberhard Otto, Wolfhart Westendorf (1986), \\"Stele - Zypresse\\": Volume 6 of Lexikon der √Ñgyptologie, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag.Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors) (2006), Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: p. 196, n.134 Nevertheless the following sentence of Josephus' quotation states \\"In his [reign]\\" implying that a Pharaoh has indeed been mentioned. The account in Josephus has also long been linked to a tale about Egypt preserved in an Indian text in which the Pharaoh's name appears as Tamovatsa.Francis Wilford, On Egypt and the Nile from the ancient books of the Hindus, Asiatic Researches vol. III p. 437 Fringe theories There have been revisionistic attempts by the historian Immanuel Velikovsky and Egyptologist David Rohl to identify Dedumose II as the Pharaoh of the Exodus, much earlier than the mainstream candidates.Pharaohs and Kings by David M. Rohl (New York, 1995). Rohl, in particular, attempted to change views on Egyptian history by shortening the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt by almost 300 years. As a by-result the synchronisms with the biblical narrative have changed, making Dedumose the pharaoh of the Exodus. Rohl's theory, however, has failed to find support among most scholars in his field.Chris Bennett (1996). \\"Temporal Fugues \\", Journal of Ancient and Medieval Studies XIII.

EIC was founded by Hugh Whalan and Scott Tudman in 2009 (website launch 2010). It has the very ambitious goal of delivering renewable energy to 15 million people in the next five years, while fighting poverty by empowering developing world entrepreneurs through microloans.M. Popova. Energy In Common: New Microfinance Venture Fights Poverty with Clean Energy. The Huffington Post. April 19, 2010. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maria-popova/energy-in-common-new- micr_b_542278.html EIC represents one of the most promising contenders in the growing green microfinance sector. As of 2012, it has ceased operations due to a lack of funds after their overseas partners defaulted on their loan obligations. EIC operates very similarly to Kiva. In the case of Kiva, lenders provide funds with zero return expected to developing world entrepreneurs to invest in their businesses (typical loans are for things like seeds for farming). EIC does this as well, but specifically focuses on purchasing renewable energy systems like solar photovoltaic panels. What makes EIC particularly unique in the microfinance non-profit sector is that they have created a model to measure the greenhouse gas emission reductions that are created by their loans. The EIC model helps provide funding to developing world entrepreneurs for energy solutions and also helps to channel additional funding into mitigating climate change.  Method of operation  # EIC enables individuals to lend money to poor entrepreneurs in the developing world via website using a Kiva-like model that connects individual lenders and borrowers. Upon choosing a borrower the lender can decide how much to lend - either a fraction or the entire loan requested by the borrower. The minimum loan is set at $25 for the standard microloans and $5 for their innovative nanoloans (discussed below). The total of a given range is usually found between $40 and a thousand dollars. When enough individual lenders have provided the fractional loans to a borrower and the total amount required has been reached, the loan is dispersed by the EIC. All of the EIC loans are meant to directly alleviate poverty and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. # EIC has partnered with several microfinance institutions (MFI)s. The MFIs provide EIC with lists of potential borrowers, which are screened by the EIC before any individual borrower is profiled. MFIs are responsible for disbursing the loan directly to the borrower and all maintenance and support services to the borrower after the energy product is purchased. To cover the expenses related to this responsibility, the MFIs receives all of the interest charged to the customer for the loan. For their part, the EIC helps their MFIs partners with sourcing reliable energy technologies. Currently, EIC works with four MFIs all based in Sub-Saharan Africa, but has plans to expand into other regions. # When a loan is repaid, funds are deposited back into the lender's account and EIC calculates the individual project's GHG emission reductions. These GHG emission reductions can be used by a lender to offset their carbon emissions through a tax deductible donation to EIC. Presumably the carbon credits may also be sold to third parties. The total carbon emission offsets are determined for a project by subtracting the carbon emissions before and after the energy loan was provided. Appropriate technologies funded by EIC The following list of primarily renewable energy technologies:Energy Technologies. EIC. Available: http://www.energyincommon.org/about/energytechnologies.cfm visited Jan 4, 2010. =Biodigesters= Biodigesters convert organic wastes such as food waste, human waste and animal waste into nutrient rich liquid fertilizer and biogas (thus a renewable fuel made up primarily of methane). A biodigester is made up of a bag or tank that holds the organic 'wastes' over a period in which bacteria breaks down the organic matter and produces biogas. Biogas is used as a replacement for kerosene, firewood, or any other combustible fuel source used in the developing world such as cow dung. Biodegesters thus produce renewable energy, cut down on odors and pathogens in organic materials, reduce surface and groundwater contamination, improve indoor air quality and provide a source of high quality organic fertilizer as a byproduct‚Äîthat has been shown to improve crop yields and decrease fertilizer costs. =Clean burning stoves= Clean burning stoves improve the fuel utilization over common stoves. There are several types but the ones funded often burn propane instead of less efficient fuels such as wood, charcoal, or dung. This is somewhat controversial as currently this allows for economic savings although clearly there is a potential to have negative effects of becoming dependent on a non-renewable energy source, which in many cases needs to be imported. Less controversial, is a clean burning stove that uses wood, charcoal, or dung, but burns more efficiently. These stoves funded by EIC are designed to increase the airflow to the fuel source, creating a better flame and reducing the amount of fuel required to provide a given amount of heat to the target (e.g. it takes less fuel wood to cook dinner). Both types of clean burning stoves reduce the costs associated with fuel use and improve the indoor air quality within the homes of the users. = Solar powered LED lighting = The LED lamps combine a small solar photovoltaic panel with a rechargeable battery and an array of LED lights into an effective lighting system, which is used to replace dangerous (indoor air quality, GHG emitting, and fire hazard) kerosene lamps. LED lights are known to be very efficient, which prolongs illumination time on the charging made available by the PV. = Solar photovoltaic home systems = A typical solar photovoltaic home system funded by EIC consists of a small solar panel (both pole or roof mounted) connected to a charge controller and a small battery. The stored solar electricity can be used both in the day and after dark to power lights and an electrical socket for other electrical equipment (e.g. cell phone charger, OLPC, radio, TV, or computer). Carbon offsets  EIC creates carbon offsets from emission reductions that have occurred over the loan term and only once the loan term has finished. In this way, lenders and those that make donations to retire carbon credits can be sure that all emission reductions have already happened. They do this by providing a detailed questionnaires before, during and after the loan, and in-depth field surveys conducted by both by EIC and independent auditing firms in order to sell the carbon offsets. The particularly clever part is that loaners may then buy the carbon credits and get a tax credit from EIC. Nanoloans In order to overcome the initial investment barrier that many people have when considering microfinance EIC developed the \\"Nanoloan\\" concept. For most microfinance institutions (e.g. Kiva) the minimum loan is $25 and the average time until repayment is about 18 months. This can put a lot of well-intentioned people off of the concept. EIC Nanoloans are a limited run of $5 loans, specifically designed to be repaid in just 60 days. The object of offering nanoloans is to introduce new lenders to the entire microlending process fast.

Since 1966 it has served as a static display in Allen Park, Michigan, alongside Interstate 94, between the Southfield Freeway interchange and Outer Drive overpass. Dimensions Along Interstate 94 in Allen Park, Michigan, early 2000s Conflicting reports credit the structure as being , , and tall.

It is not made of rubber, but of a Uniroyal-developed polyester resin reinforced with glass fiber, which makes it flame resistant. It is the largest non- production tire scale model ever built, and one of the world's largest roadside attractions. History The Big Tire was first created as a Ferris wheel for the 1964 New York World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, NY. Located on Grand Central Parkway next to the Transportation and Travel PavilionTransportation and Travel Pavilion and now part of the Queens Zoo, it was originally emblazoned \\"U S ROYAL TIRES\\". Designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, the same architectural firm that designed the Empire State Building, the wheel carried over 2 million people, including prominent passengers such as Jacqueline Kennedy, Telly Savalas, and the Shah of Iran. It had 24 barrel- shaped gondolas, each carrying up to 4 people, and could carry up to 96 passengers. It was driven by a 100 hp engine. When the fair ended in 1965, the tire was disassembled and shipped to Detroit via 22 trucks, where it was reassembled without its passenger gondolas in 1966 as a static display outside a Uniroyal sales office. Later, the sales office moved but the tire remained, becoming an icon of Detroit's industrial power. Today it still stands tall as a symbol of Uniroyal's heritage and a Detroit landmark. On May 20, 2015, Uniroyal staged an event to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the tire for members of the Automotive Press Association and other guests, who toured its interior. Renovations Michelin completed its purchase of the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company in 1990, and in 1994 announced plans to renovate the landmark, including a new hubcap and the addition of neon lights for the UNIROYAL lettering. The tire's fiberglass cover was cleaned, painted, and modernized with a new sleek look. In 1998, a giant nail weighing . was placed in its tread as a promotion for Uniroyal's new NailGard puncture resistant tire. The nail was removed in 2003 and was donated to the city of Allen Park, to be auctioned on eBay to raise funds for the Allen Park Historical Society programs and facilities. In 2003, the Giant Tire was renovated as part of Detroit's I-94 corridor revitalization project. The work included the replacement of 30 interior steel beams, asphalt and storm drain installation, and the replacement of the neon lettering with reflective lettering.

They were a community that historically were involved with weaving and some were involved slash and burn agriculture, and occupied the hilly terrain of south Mirzapur district. The Bhuiyar are further divided into sub-divisions, which are referred to as kori. Their main koris are the Baria, Birkunia, Chandnihys, Chetrihya, Chiriha, Dioriya, Khutta, Parha, Patparaha and Sudha. They are strictly endogamous, and practice clan exogamy. The Bhuiyar are found in the districts of Sonbhadra and Mirzapur. They speak Hindi, having long forgotten their Munda language.  Present circumstances  The Bhuiyar are now a community of settled agriculturists. Their earlier slash and burn practices have disappeared. Most Bhuiyar are a small and medium-sized farmers, with a minority being employed as agricultural labourers. Many are now also employed in the mines that have appeared in Mirzapur district. They live in multi-caste villages, occupying their own distinct quarters. They have much in common with neighbouring tribal communities such as the Kol, Agariya and Chero. Each of their settlement contains an informal caste council, known as a biradari panchayat. The panchayat acts as instrument of social control, dealing with issues such as divorce and adultery. The 2011 Census of India for Uttar Pradesh showed the Bhuiyar population as 28,360.

Early life and education Adams was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and graduated from Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona in 1991. Adams served a mission on behalf of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Tonga. Political career =Arizona legislature= Adams was first elected to the Arizona legislature in 2006. During his tenure in the State House, Adams endorsed legislation which resulted in the largest permanent tax cut in Arizona history. As Speaker, Adams took on public-employee unions, authoring legislation to reform Arizona's pension system for public employees by raising the retirement age, eliminating cost of living adjustments, preventing employees from receiving a pension while working, reducing benefits for elected officials and requiring police officers, firefighters, elected officials and corrections employees pay more for their pensions. Adams opted out of the elected officials retirement plan, earning him recognition from the National Taxpayers Union. As Speaker, Adams supported Arizona's immigration reform bill and solicited outside funding to defend the measure in court. =2012 Congressional campaign= In the Spring of 2011, Adams resigned from office to announce that he would run in 2012 for Congress in Arizona's 5th congressional district, after redistricting, the seat left open by Jeff Flake. He was then defeated by former Congressman Matt Salmon in the primary. =Post 2012 Congressional campaign= A few weeks after losing his primary race against Matt Salmon for a congressional seat, Adams became president of Americans for Responsible Leadership a political lobbying non-profit 501(c)(4). Adams has claimed as one of his responsibilities the allocation of funds and directed $750,000 spent opposing Arizona Proposition 204, and $450,000 against Proposition_121.

Production As a tribute to many of the African-American stars' rise to fame in the 1960 and 1970s, Vy Higginsen based her musical on the life of her sister Doris Troy. Troy's 1963 hit \\"Just One Look\\" launched her to international fame and a successful career in London, although her roots were in her church choir. This is not unlike the rise of other R&B; and jazz singers such as Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle and Donna Summer. Vy Higginsen and Ken Wydro, her husband, conceived the play in January 1979 and subsequently wrote the book and lyrics. The musical, however, was rejected by every major producer in New York. The lack of interest was largely due to the doubtfulness that a large enough audience would be attracted to a gospel-based production. The couple persisted without a producer, and invested their life-savings to hire out the 632-seat Heckscher Theatre in East Harlem, which had previously been closed for 15 years. Vy envisioned her audience as being \\"senior citizens, church groups, school children, and hard-working black mothers and fathers who had spiritual values and loved soul-stirring music.\\" Mama, I Want to Sing! opened on March 23, 1983, on a very tight budget; however, word of mouth throughout the black community spread the news about the work. Audiences flocked to see the musical, which \\"presented the passion, spontaneity and emotional uplift of the black church experience along with a universal message for anyone with a dream.\\" Currently, Mama, I Want to Sing! has played 2,500 performances in New York and another 1,000 performances throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan. It has been performed in front of thousands of people, and is the longest running black off-Broadway musical in American history. On January 7, 1985, Time magazine named Mama, I Want to Sing! one of the ten \\"Best of '84\\" theater performances. On January 20, 1986, the show hit its 1000th performance milestone. On February 1‚Äì6, 1994, Mama, I Want to Sing! played to 40,000 at the Paramount Theater at Madison Square Garden. In 2003‚Äì04, Mama, I Want to Sing! celebrated its 20th anniversary at the Williams Institute C.M.E. Baptist Church in Harlem, formerly the Lafayette Theater. 2011 saw the release of the long-awaited premiere of the film adaptation of the musical by 20th Century Fox. The Encyclopedia of Popular Music noted that, within four years of its 1983 debut, the musical drew an audience of more than 3million spectators and had grossed ¬£38million (), equivalent to more than adjusted for inflation.

The musical was given an overall positive review from Stephen Holden of The New York Times, saying: \\"The sequel's romance lends the sequel a warmth and sexiness that the original show lacked.\\" Although the review continued to say, \\"The dialogue and line readings sometimes go completely flat.\\" Holden added: \\"But in an odd way, the show's weaknesses seem inseparable from its strengths.\\" He concluded by saying, \\"To attend either production of Mama with a typical audience made up largely of church groups, some of which have traveled hundreds of miles by chartered bus to be there, is to be indelibly reminded of the enduring power of that tradition.\\" =Born to Sing= Born to Sing, the finale to the trilogy reveals the behind‚Äìthe-scenes activities of Doris Winter's international tour along with her 15-year-old daughter. =Mama, I Want to Sing, The Whole Story= In the autumn of 1992, Mama, I Want to Sing, The Whole Story, a combination show featuring the storylines and music from both the shows, premiered in a 10-week tour in Japan. =Mama, I Want to Sing: The Movie= The 2011 adaptation of Mama, I Want to Sing! is inspired by the stage play and features brand new music. The story revolves around Amara Winter who enters the pop music scene, causing conflict with her mother.

When it rocks, it heads for the arenas; when it slinks, it seeks the cover of low, gray clouds. That problem has two-fold consequences. First, it makes many the songs maudlin and melodramatic, occasionally unbearable. What's more, it makes each Dears approach-- heavy rock insurgencies, sweeping synthesizer ambles, big breezy janglers-- seem that much more polar. The album feels scattered and uneven, like a band without direction or restraint.\\" (Rating: 2.4) Pitchfork - Reviews - Albums - Degeneration Street by the Dears * Paste Magazine - \\"If Degeneration Street, The Dears‚Äô fifth full-length, is any indication, they don't seem to give too much of a shit.

It will no doubt go down well at their famously torrid live shows, and will probably be popular with drivers. Just don‚Äôt expect much in the way of subtlety, humour or lyrics that stand up to much analysis in a home listen context.

'Yesteryear‚Äô juts out with ‚Äô60s pop charm, the band‚Äôs full-blooded power only blitzkrieging through in its chorus, while opener ‚ÄòOmega Dog‚Äô and ‚ÄòStick With Me Kid‚Äô marry undercurrents of nocturnal electronics and coy strings to the more recognizable guitar and vocal traits. Ultimately, though, its success still falls on Lightburn's shoulders, a vocalist who's always straddled the line between impassioned and overwrought.

The former influences have become diluted and the band stands as its own protagonists, inventive for sure but flirting with commercialism en route.

Hagopian is an American violinist, entrepreneur, record producer and founder of Traditional Crossroads world music record label in 1993.  Biography  Hagopian is the son of Armenian-American oud virtuoso Richard Hagopian. His paternal grandparents fled the Armenian Genocide and settled in California. He was raised on the family‚Äôs grape farm in Fresno where he discovered his love for music at a very young age. He was playing the drum along with his father at the age of 4 and continued his interest in music until he found his passion in violin playing at just 5 years old. Hagopian graduated from The Juilliard School in 1988 with a B.M. in classical violin.  Career  =Musician= During his undergraduate studies, Hagopian performed with the Juilliard orchestra. He also went to Russia where he practiced violin with local musicians in a Haydn quartet. In 1994, he performed with the Tulare County Symphony in California. The late Alan Hovhaness had written a violin concerto specifically for Hagopian, which he was able to premiere during a performance. Hagopian also plays the kanun and clarinet, and has served as the director of the Cornell Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Music Ensemble (CMEME) at Cornell University. Hagopian has frequently accompanied his father, Richard Hagopian, in performances in the past. He has performed in a number of ensembles with prominent Balkan artists such as Yuri Yunakov, and performed with Fazil's Night Club orchestra which also included Omar Faruk Tekbilek. Hagopian is also a consultant to the Silk Road Project founded by Yo-Yo Ma. = Business ventures = Hagopian is responsible for bringing the Heifetz violin mute back to prominence. He co- founded a company which manufactures and sells the mutes, which had been discontinued in the 1960s. = Producer = After he completed his undergraduate study at Juilliard, Hagopian took a job at P.P.I. Recording in New York City in order to learn more about the recording industry. This job served as a launchpad for Harold to further his career. He often used the studio to make recordings during his personal time. Hagopian also made records with his father for the British Arc label and Smithsonian/Folkways. Hagopian cites Jascha Heifetz as one of his major influences in his career and his reason for procuring a job at RCA. He was offered a position as a reissue producer at RCA Victor/BMG Classics in 1990 after demonstrating his vast knowledge of the Heifetz recordings, style and repertoire in an interview with RCA producer Jack Pfeiffer. He was ultimately responsible for remastering and re-releasing over 1,000 classical music records in about just 10 years of his career at RCA. = Traditional Crossroads = Hagopian used the same principles and techniques he had used in remastering and re-releasing classical music and applied them to world music.

The flagship program of the network is The Adam Carolla Show, which is released daily. The network also produces several other shows that are released on a weekly basis. History Carolla Digital (then the ACE Broadcasting Network) was launched on February 23, 2009 with the first broadcast of The Adam Carolla Podcast. When Carolla's terrestrial radio show was cancelled, Carolla saw an opportunity to launch the podcast that would become the flagship show of ACE Broadcasting. Carolla and Misraje worked out of Carolla's Glendale warehouse, which is now the network's recording studio, to record the show. In 2012 ACE Broadcasting was rebranded as Carolla Digital. With the success of The Adam Carolla Podcast, which was later renamed The Adam Carolla Show, the network grew. In late 2009, Carcast debuted. In early 2010, Spider and the Henchman, The Parent Experiment, Daves of Thunder, and The Film Vault had their first shows. Shows debuting in late 2010 were Life Lessons with Jim Carolla, This Week with Larry Miller, The Big 3 Podcast, and The Punch with Craig Carlisle. Ace on the House debuted in early 2011, and For Crying Out Loud debuted in late 2011. Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend and Penn's Sunday School debuted in early 2012. In September 2012, Dr. Drew announced on Adam's show that he will soon have a program on this network. Financial backing Initially, production and distribution costs of the podcast were funded entirely by Carolla himself. Carolla stated that bandwidth costs were over $9,000 per month as of May 2009. In September 2009 Carolla began generating revenue for the show with spoken advertisements for his first sponsors. Shows on the network currently include both prerecorded and live read advertisements for sponsors. In many cases, the network receives profits directly from the sales generated through their referrals (tracked by offer codes). In the past, ACE Broadcasting content has been distributed through channels other than the ACE Broadcasting website and iTunes. ACE Broadcasting previously had distribution deals with CBS Radio and Stitcher Radio. The network was in talks with Sirius XM radio to distribute content through the Howard 101 channel, but an agreement between the two parties was not reached. Also contributing to the funding of the network, Carolla performs live in the greater Los Angeles area and around the country. The live shows have included elements of the podcast as well as improvisation. Recordings of live performances have in turn been re-broadcast as podcasts themselves. As these live performances became more popular, friends of the show occasionally joined Carolla. Indirect additional revenue comes from the network increasing the popularity of Carolla's unrecorded standup performances, as well as his other publications and productions, each often promoted on various podcasts. Programming =Current programming= Carolla Digital offers the following shows: The Adam Carolla Show The Adam Carolla Show is a daily podcast featuring Adam Carolla. Carolla is joined most days by co-hosts Gina Grad (who presents news stories) and Bryan Bishop (who provides audio drops). Each show begins with commentary from the hosts on both mainstream and obscure news stories. The trio are then joined by a celebrity guest or friend of the show for an interview segment. The interview then transitions back into the news with the guest contributing their thoughts on the events of the day. The show also sometimes features Adam's one-on-one interviews with guests. The Adam & Dr. Drew Show \\"The Adam & Dr. Drew Show\\" features Adam Carolla & Dr. Drew Pinsky. The format is similar to that of Loveline, in that the show begins with thoughts from Adam and Drew, followed by listener calls on subjects like drug addictions, sexual dysfunctions, and depression. Unlike Loveline, sound bites and sound drops are uncommon. The show typically features just Adam and Drew, but occasionally they are joined by a guest; frequent guests include comedians Brad Williams, and Jo Koy. As of May 2016, the show now produces five episodes per week which are released on the same days as The Adam Carolla Show podcast. Carcast Carcast features Adam Carolla and co-host Matt Deandrea. The duo discuss cars and interview celebrities and car enthusiasts. The show debuted at number 1 in the Automotive section of iTunes. The former co-host Sandy Ganz left the show during the dispute between Carolla and Donny Misraje, Ganz's cousin.The Adam Carolla Show January 3, 2012 Penn's Sunday School A follow-up to Penn Radio, each Sunday, instead of attending church, atheists Penn Jillette, Michael Goudeau, and Matt Donnelly discuss news of the previous week, religion, and other suggested topics. Ace on the House Ace on the House is a home improvement show, derived from a periodic segment on The Adam Carolla Show. Carolla answers listener questions and dispenses advice regarding home improvement topics. Carolla was a carpenter prior to his radio and acting jobs. He is frequently joined by guest hosts with home improvement backgrounds. In late 2011, Ray Oldhafer was introduced as co-host. In 2017, a second weekly show was introduced with Oldhafer joined by Eric Stromer. In 2018, Oldhafer was let go and the podcast returned to one show per week hosted by Carolla and co-hosted by Stromer. The Dr. Drew Podcast A program hosted by Dr. Drew Pinsky. Dr. Drew will typically take listener calls and discuss topics relating to sexual and emotional health, as well as addiction medicine with experts in particular fields. Shows will often carry a theme based on which guest expert is participating. For Crying Out Loud Hosted by Lynette Carolla and Stefanie Wilder-Taylor, For Crying Out Loud expands The Parent Experiment to include discussion of popular culture and life beyond parenting, as well as statements made by Lynette's husband on his program. The Great Love Debate Based on the nationally touring series of live shows, it is hosted by Great Love Debate creator Brian Howie who is joined each week in-studio by Celebrity Guests and the rest of The Debate Team ‚Äì actress/writer Jill Bartlett, Dating and Social Media Expert Kate Edwards, and the world's most dynamic voices on love, dating, and relationships! Listen in as we raise some questions, find some answers, and have a whole lot of fun as we attempt to answer the question \\"Why is Everyone Still Single?\\" Hammer & Nails Hammer and Nails is a twice-weekly collaboration with husband & wife team, Skip and Alison Bedell, who also co-host Spike TV's Catch A Contractor with Adam Carolla. The couple routinely discusses several topics including a behind-the-scenes look at CAC episodes, things that make them shout \\"What the F*ck?!\\", current events, answering viewer/listener questions, hysterical banter about what's happenin' in their lives, \\"Skip's Tips\\" and Alison's latest obsession. Shows will either be produced and in-studio with engineer Joe Cumia, or ‚ÄúOn The Road (OTR)‚Äù: a raw, mostly unedited podcast with the Bedells while they are away from home, that'll make you feel like you're hanging out sitting right there with them. Reasonable Doubt Comedian Adam Carolla is joined by criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos for a conversation about current events, pop-culture and their own personal lives. Along with occasional guests the guys will also take listener phone calls and answer your questions. =Previous programming= The following shows were previously provided by ACE Broadcasting: This Week with Larry Miller Each week, Larry Miller tells stories from his own life, in the tradition of great American radio raconteurs like Jean Shepherd and Garrison Keillor. Miller's tales are smart without being stuffy or hostile, and uplifting without being naive. Common topics include Miller's love for fusing together scraps of soap bars, drinking and the enjoyment of the simple pleasures of life. This show resumed 9 January 2013, being on hiatus since Miller suffered a head injury in April 2012. This podcast is still available as an independent entity with the new name The Larry Miller Show. Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend Hosted by former ACS newsgirl Alison Rosen, this podcast swaps between formats depending on the day of the week. Mondays feature Alison interviewing a variety of guests, including comedians, authors, and fellow podcasters. Thursday episodes are typically a round-table discussion between Alison, Jenna Kim Jones, and others (the previous set of Thursday regulars included multiple members of the Carolla Digital crew). This podcast is still available as an independent entity. Life Lessons with Jim Carolla Life Lessons was a series of recorded therapy sessions between Jim Carolla, Adam's Father, and Ray Oldhafer, Adam's lifelong friend. The show was meant as a way to remove the veil from therapy sessions. Jim Carolla's love of jazz was also a common topic of the show. In July 2012, Adam cancelled this program because it was losing him money and his father refused to ask for PayPal donations on the air. Adam has frequently mentioned the demise of this programme on his own Podcasts. The Parent Experiment The Parent Experiment was a weekly discussion of issues facing parents. The show featured discussion between the hosts, both of whom are mothers, regarding their daily lives as well as interviews and features on special topics. The Big 3 Podcast Don Barris, Tony Barbieri, and Perry Caramello, known for their appearances in the Comedy Central film Windy City Heat, host this comedy podcast. Included are appearances from Terrifying Tim and other guest comedians. In September 2011, the show moved to Simply Don the Podcast Network. The Film Vault The Film Vault was a movie-based podcast hosted by Bryan Bishop and Anderson Cowan. The hosts, both former Loveline employees (where Bishop was a phone screener, and Cowan still is the Audio Engineer,) take a look back into the annals of film to comprise their top 5 films of a different genre each week. The hosts chose to end the show, prompted by the departure of producer Logan Moy from the network. The show has since resumed independent of ACE Broadcasting. The Punch with Craig Carlisle Hosted by Craig Carlisle and recorded live at the Elephant Theater, The Punch was a variety show styled podcast featuring readings and performances by various artists. Spider and the Henchman This \\"SportsCast\\" was hosted by Kevin Hench, Carolla's writing partner on The Hammer and frequent Fox Sports contributor, and John \\"Spider\\" Salley, a 4-time NBA champion. The hosts of Spider and the Henchman discussed the events taking place in the world of sports, sometimes with a guest, in a loose format. Daves of Thunder Daves of Thunder was a comedy podcast featuring Dave Dameshek and David Feeney. The co-hosts were joined by a family of characters including Jacuzzi Pete, Blaster Girl, Pizza Jack, Doubleton the Butler, and many others in the Daves of Thunder Players. The line between scripted comedy and reality was often blurred in this show and it was difficult for listeners to determine what was \\"real.\\" The show also featured many inside jokes including Dameshek's propensity to list items in order of desirability, particularly mustards, Feeney's love of a perfectly scripted comedic bit, Jacuzzi Pete's mixed feelings on 9/11, Dameshek's webbed feet, and Blaster Girl's affinity for marijuana. The show had a run of 63 episodes over a span of almost a full year. The first episode aired on 14 March 2010 and the last show was released on 28 February 2011. The abrupt cancellation of this popular podcast created something of an uproar among fans seeking some form of explanation.

History =Spanish colonization= Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia founding the city of Santiago In 1536, Spanish explorer Diego de Almagro arrived to present day Chile hoping to find another territory as rich as Peru, however, discovering no mineral resources in the territory, he soon returned to Peru.Encyclopedia Britannica: Chile In 1540, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia entered Chile and founded the city of Santiago. In 1553, during the Battle of Tucapel, Pedro de Valdivia was killed by Mapuche warriors. In 1542, Chile became part of the Spanish Empire and was governed by the Viceroyalty of Peru based in Lima. In 1776 the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata based in Buenos Aires was created and Chile was immediately administered by the new Viceroyalty. Due to the lack of mineral wealth in the territory, very few Spanish migrants settled in Chile and those who did, mostly worked the land as farmers. =Independence= In the early 19th century, a wave of independence sentiment was rolling through the Spanish Empire in Latin America. On 18 September 1810, leaders of the Captaincy General of Chile declared Chile as an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy. For the next decade, Chilean forces would battle Spanish troops for independence. In October 1814, Chilean troops lost during the Battle of Rancagua which led to the Reconquista of Chile by Spain from 1814 to 1817. In February 1817, troops led by General Bernardo O'Higgins, along with General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and the Army of the Andes entered Chile from Argentina through the Andes and fought Spain in the Battle of Chacabuco which resulted in a Chilean/Argentine victory. In April 1818, O'Higgins and San Mart√≠n's forces fought Spanish troops led by General Mariano Osorio at the Battle of Maip√∫ which secured Chile's and Argentina's independence. =Post- independence= Chilean President Michelle Bachelet on a state visit to Spain meeting with Spanish King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia in Madrid, 2014.

Generally, priming effects take place whenever a response to a target stimulus is influenced by a prime stimulus presented at an earlier time. The distinctive feature of response priming is that prime and target are presented in quick succession (typically, less than 100 milliseconds apart) and are coupled to identical or alternative motor responses. When a speeded motor response is performed to classify the target stimulus, a prime immediately preceding the target can thus induce response conflicts when assigned to a different response as the target. These response conflicts have observable effects on motor behavior, leading to priming effects, e.g., in response times and error rates. A special property of response priming is its independence from visual awareness of the prime. Response priming as a visuomotor effect In 1962, Fehrer and RaabFehrer, E., & Raab, D. Reaction time to stimuli masked by metacontrast. In: Journal of Experimental Psychology, Nr. 63, 1962, p. 143-147. reported experiments where participants were required to press a single key as quickly as possible upon presentation of a visual target stimulus. The visibility of the target was strongly reduced by so-called metacontrast masking (see below). The authors found that the response times were independent of the subjective visibility of the target, i.e., responses to well-visible targets were just as fast as those to nearly invisible targets (Fehrer-Raab effect). The term response priming was first employed by Rosenbaum and KornblumRosenbaum, D. A., & Kornblum, S. (1982). A priming method for investigating the selection of motor responses. Acta Psychologica, 51, p. 223-243. with respect to an experimental paradigm where different aspects of motor responses were primed by visual stimuli. The modern procedure of response priming was developed in the 1980s and 1990s by Peter Wolff, Werner Klotz, Ulrich Ansorge, and Odmar Neumann at the University of Bielefeld, Germany.Klotz, W., & Wolff, P. : The effect of a masked stimulus on the response to the masking stimulus.

I., K√§lberer, H., & Kruse, H. : Sensorimotor supremacy: Investigating conscious and unconscious vision by masked priming. In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology, Nr. 3, 2007, p. 257-274. The paradigm was developed further in the 1990s by a research team led by Dirk Vorberg at the University of Braunschweig, Germany.Vorberg, D., Mattler, U., Heinecke, A., Schmidt, T., & Schwarzbach, J.: Different time courses for visual perception and action priming. In: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Nr. 100, 2003, p. 6275-6280. Fig. 1 a Typical time course of a trial in a response priming paradigm. Here, the participant responds as quickly as possible to the shape of the target stimulus (diamond or square) by pressing the assigned response key. Shortly before, a prime is presented (also a diamond or square) that influences the response to the target. The time interval between prime onset and target onset is called the \\"stimulus-onset asynchrony\\" (SOA). In many response priming experiments, the target also serves to visually mask the prime. Therefore, a second task is often employed where participants are asked to identify the masked prime. b) Prime and target are consistent when assigned to the same response, and inconsistent when assigned to different responses. c) The visibility of the prime can be strongly influenced by masking effects from the target. Fig. 2: Typical time course of response priming effects (fictitious data). Consistent primes (blue) speed responses to the target, inconsistent primes (purple) slow them. In addition, consistent primes only rarely lead to response errors, whereas error rates can be very high for inconsistent primes. In response times as well as error rates, priming effects typically increase with SOA. In all response priming paradigms, participants have to respond to a specific target stimulus. In a simple experiment, this could be one of two geometric stimuli, each of which is assigned to one of two response keys (e.g., diamond - left key; square - right key). The experiment consists of a large number of trials where the participant presses the left key upon appearance of a diamond, and the right key upon appearance of a square, as quickly and correctly as possible. In each trial, the target is preceded by a prime that is also a diamond or square, and therefore able to elicit the same motor responses as the target (Fig. 1a). If prime and target are linked to the same response (diamond preceded by diamond, square preceded by square), they are called \\"consistent\\" (also \\"congruent\\", \\"compatible\\"); if they are linked to different motor responses (diamond preceded by square, square preceded by diamond), they are called \\"inconsistent\\" (also \\"incongruent\\", \\"incompatible\\"; Fig. 1b). The time interval between onset of the prime and onset of the target is called \\"stimulus onset asynchrony\\" (SOA). Typically, SOAs up to 100 milliseconds (ms) are employed. Priming effects occur when the prime influences the motor response to the target: consistent primes speed responses to the target, whereas inconsistent primes slow responses (Fig. 2). Priming effects in response times are calculated by taking the difference between response times in inconsistent and consistent trials. Apart from their effects on response speed, primes can greatly affect the rate of response errors (i.e., erroneous responses to the target): consistent primes rarely lead to errors, whereas error rates can become very high for inconsistent primes. In response times as well as error rates, priming effects typically increase with SOA, leading to the typical response priming patterns in Fig. 2. This implies that the more time is elapsing between prime and target, the larger the prime's influences on the response. For average response times of 350-450 ms, the response priming effect can become as large as 100 ms, making it one of the numerically largest effects in response time research. Results from many experiments show that the increase of priming with SOA occurs because the prime has an increasing amount of time to influence the response process before the actual target stimulus can come into play and control the motor response on its own. This is evident from the time-course of motor activity in the EEG,Leuthold, H., & Kopp, B. : Mechanisms of priming by masked stimuli: Inferences from event-related brain potentials.

Therefore, the ultimate size of the priming effect depends both on properties of the stimuli and on properties of the task. Primes with high stimulus energy (e.g., higher contrast, longer duration) and tasks with easy stimulus discriminations lead to large priming effects, whereas primes with low stimulus energy and tasks with difficult discriminations lead to smaller effects. Priming effects can be amplified by visual attention directed to the prime's position or to its relevant features just in time for the prime's appearance.Sumner, P., Tsai, P.-C., Yu, K., & Nachev, P.: Attentional modulation of sensorimotor processes in the absence of perceptual awareness.

For longer SOAs, the priming effect can increase further. Under some circumstances, however, a reversal of the effect can be observed where inconsistent primes lead to faster responses to the target than do consistent primes. This effect is known as the \\"negative compatibility effect\\".Jaskowski, P.: The negative compatibility effect with nonmasking flankers: A case for mask-triggered inhibition hypothesis.

In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology, Nr. 3, 2007, p. 317-326. Masked priming Response priming can be employed to investigate phenomena of perception without awareness. Here, the visibility of the prime can be systematically reduced or even abolished by means of a masking stimulus. This can be accomplished by presenting the masking stimulus shortly before or after the prime.Breitmeyer, B. G., & √ñƒümen, H.: Visual masking. In: Scholarpedia, 2007, 2(7): 3330. The prime's visibility can be assessed by different measures, such as forced-choice discrimination tasks, stimulus detection judgments, brightness judgments, and others.Ansorge, U., Breitmeyer, B. G., & Becker, S. I.: Comparing sensitivity across different processing measures under metacontrast masking conditions. In: Vision Research, Nr. 47, 2007, p. 3335-3349.Ansorge, U., Becker, S. I., & Breitmeyer, B.: Revisiting the metacontrast dissociation: Comparing sensitivity across different measures and tasks. In: Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, Nr. 62, 2009, p. 286-309. A phenomenon named metacontrast masking can be produced when the prime is followed by a mask enclosing the prime's shape such that both stimuli share adjacent contours. For instance, a prime can be masked by a larger annulus whose inner contours exactly fit the prime's shape. In many response priming experiments, the target serves the additional purpose of masking the prime (Fig. 1). Metacontrast is a form of visual backward masking where the visibility of the prime is reduced by a stimulus following the prime.Breitmeyer, B. G., & √ñƒümen, H.: Visual masking. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006DiLollo, V., Enns, J. T., & Rensink, R. A.: Competition for consciousness among visual events: The psychophysics of re- entrant visual processes. In: Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Nr. 129, 2000, p. 481-507. In Fig. 3, some typical time-courses of visual masking effects are shown as a function of the prime-target SOA, in a response-priming experiment where the target itself serves as a masking stimulus (Fig. 1a, c). Here, the measure of prime visibility could be the discrimination performance of a participant trying to guess the shape of the prime (diamond or square) in each trial. Without masking, performance would be nearly perfect; the participant would have little difficulty classifying the prime correctly as a square or a diamond in every trial. In contrast, if masking was complete, discrimination performance would be at chance level (Fig. 3, left panel). In many experiments, however, the time-course of masking is less extreme (Fig. 3, right panel). Most stimulus conditions lead to so-called \\"type-A masking\\", where the degree of masking is highest at short SOAs and then diminishes, so that the prime becomes easier to discriminate for increasing SOAs. Under some circumstances, however, \\"type-B masking\\" can be obtained, where the degree of masking is highest at intermediate SOAs but where the prime becomes easier to discriminate at shorter or longer SOAs. Type-B masking can occur with metacontrast masking but critically depends on stimulus properties of primes and targets. In addition, the time-course of masking can vary greatly from person to person.Albrecht, T., Klap√∂tke, S., & Mattler, U.: Individual differences in metacontrast masking are enhanced by perceptual learning. In: Consciousness and Cognition, Nr. 19, 2010, p. 656‚Äì666. Independence of response priming from visual awareness Fig. 3: Typical patterns of backward masking (fictitious data). When a participant tries to identify the prime, response accuracy depends on the degree of masking. Without masking, the prime is identified with nearly perfect accuracy (purple), while accuracy drops to chance level (50 %) when masking is complete (left panel). Depending on the type of mask, other time-courses of masking are possible (right panel). In type-A masking, the degree of masking is highest when prime and target follow each other at short SOAs, and decreases with SOA (purple). In type-B masking, the degree of masking is stronger at intermediate SOAs than at shorter or longer SOAs (red). Type-B time-courses can be obtained in metacontrast masking under specific stimulus conditions. Experiments show that the time-course of the response priming effect (increasing effects with increasing SOA) is independent of the degree and time-course of masking. Klotz and Neumann (1999) demonstrated response priming effects under complete masking of the prime. Extending these findings to other time-courses of visual masking, Vorberg et al. varied the time-course of masking by controlling the relative duration of primes and targets. In their experiments, targets were arrows pointing left or right, while primes were smaller arrows metacontrast-masked by the targets. When participants tried to identify the pointing direction of the primes, any of the time-courses depicted in Fig. 3 could be produced depending on stimulus conditions: complete visibility, complete masking, type-A masking, and type-B masking. However, when participants had to respond as quickly as possible to the direction of the target, priming effects in all those conditions were virtually identical. Moreover, the time-course of priming was always the same (increasing priming effect with increasing SOA), no matter whether the primes were visible or invisible and no matter whether visibility increased or decreased with SOA. Of special interest is the case where priming effects are increasing even though prime visibility is decreasing. Such opposite time- coursse of priming and visual awareness of the prime clearly show that both processes rely on different mechanisms.Schmidt, T., & Vorberg, D.: Criteria for unconscious cognition: Three types of dissociation. In: Perception & Psychophysics, Nr. 68, 2006, p. 489-504. This finding could be confirmed in many further experiments revealing numerous dissociations between masking and priming.Breitmeyer, B.

The independence of priming and visual awareness clearly contradicts the traditional notion that effects of unconscious perception merely reflect some residual processing ability under very unfavorable viewing conditions, something that remains after a prime stimulus has been degraded so severely that conscious awareness of it has decreased below some \\"threshold\\". This conception has often led to sharp criticism of research on unconscious or \\"subliminal\\" perception,Eriksen, C.

In: Seeing and Perceiving, Nr. 23, 2010, p. 89-151. but it is probably wrong on a basic level. Instead, motor activation by masked primes is obviously independent of processes of backward masking, provided that visibility is controlled only by the masking stimulus while the prime stimulus remains unchanged. In other words: for a short time and under suitable experimental conditions, visually masked (invisible) stimuli can influence motor responses just as effectively as visible ones. Variants Given that the researcher is aware of the most influential experimental variables,Schmidt, F., Haberkamp, A., & Schmidt, T.: Dos and don'ts in response priming research. In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology, Nr. 7, 2011, p. 120‚Äì131. the response priming method can be employed in a number of experimental variants and can contribute to the exploration of a multitude of research questions in the field of cognitive psychology.Schmidt, T., Haberkamp, A., Veltkamp, G. M., Weber, A., Seydell- Greenwald, A., & Schmidt, F.: Visual processing in rapid-chase systems: Image processing, attention, and awareness. In: Frontiers in Psychology, Nr. 2, 2011, S. 1‚Äì16. The most prevalent form of response priming employs a prime and target at the same monitor position, so that the target also serves to visually mask the prime (often by means of metacontrast). In many experiments, there are two different targets preceded by two different primes at the same monitor positions. Participants then have to discriminate the two targets and respond to the position of the task-relevant target. Sometimes, three stimulus types are employed (prime, mask, target), especially when the prime-target SOA has to be very long. Sometimes, no mask is employed at all. Primes and targets do not have to appear at the same screen position: One stimulus can flank the other, like in the Eriksen paradigmEriksen, B. A., & Eriksen, C. W.: Effects of noise letters upon the identification of a target letter in a nonsearch task. In: Perception & Psychophysics, Nr. 16, 1974, p. 143-149.Schwarz, W., & Mecklinger, A.: Relationship between flanker identifiability and compatibility effect. In: Perception & Psychophysics, Nr. 57, 1995, p. 1045-1052. (indeed, the Eriksen effect may be a special case of response priming). Response- priming effects have been demonstrated for a large number of stimuli and discrimination tasks, including geometric stimuli, color stimuli, various types of arrows,Jaskowski, P., & Slosarek, M.: How important is the prime's gestalt for subliminal priming? In: Consciousness and Cognition, Nr. 16, 2007, p. 485.497. natural images (animals vs. objects), vowels and consonants,Kunde, W., Kiesel, A., Hoffmann, J.: Conscious control over the content of unconscious cognition. In: Cognition, Nr. 88, 2003, p. 223-242. letters, and digits. In one study, chess configurations were presented as primes and targets, and participants had to decide whether the king was in check. Mattler (2003) could show that response priming can not only influence motor responses, but also works for cognitive operations like a spatial shift of visual attention or a shift between two different response time tasks. Different types of masking have been employed as well. Instead of measuring keypress responses (commonly with two response alternatives), some studies use more than two response alternatives or record speech responses, speeded finger pointing movements, eye movements,Schwarzbach, J., & Vorberg, D.: Response priming with and without awareness. In: H. √ñƒümen & B. G. Breitmeyer (Eds.), The first half second: The microgenesis and temporal dynamics of unconscious and conscious visual processes. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. or so-called readiness potentials which reflect the degree of motor activation in the brain's motor cortex and can be measured by electro-encephalographic methods.Jaskowski, P., Bialunska, A., Tomanek, M., & Verleger, R.: Mask- and distractor-triggered inhibitory processes in the priming of motor responses: An EEG study., In: Psychophysiology, Nr. 45, 2008, p. 70-85. Brain imaging methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been employed as well. Theories In the part that follows, three theories that explain the regular, positive response priming effects will be described. A review of theories of the negative compatibility effect can be found in Sumner (2007). =Direct parameter specification= Fig. 4: Central tenets of direct parameter specification theory and the action trigger account. When the response to a target stimulus is sufficiently practiced, the response can be prepared to a degree where only a single critical stimulus feature is needed to specify and elicit the response. Response elicitation by the prime occurs quickly and directly without the need for a conscious representation of the stimulus. In parallel to these visuomotor processes, a conscious representation of primes and targets emerges which can be subject to visual masking but plays no role in the actual motor processing in the current trial. More recent variants of the theory stress the role of so-called trigger conditions which determine how stimuli and responses are linked in a given task. The theory of direct parameter specification (Fig. 4) was proposed by Odmar Neumann at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, to explain the Fehrer- Raab effect as well as the results of early response priming studies.Neumann, O.: Direct parameter specification and the concept of perception. In: Psychological Research, Nr. 52, 1990, p. 207-215. The theory assumes that at the outset of a response priming experiment, participants acquire rules of stimulus-response assignment, which quickly become automatized. Following this practice phase, the motor response can be prepared so far that only a single critical stimulus feature (e.g., diamond vs. square) is still needed to specify the response. This incoming stimulus feature then defines the last missing action parameter (e.g., left vs. right keypress). Responses are elicited quickly and directly, without the need for a conscious representation of the eliciting stimulus. Response priming is explained by assuming that the prime's features elicit exactly the same parameter specification processes that are supposed to be elicited by the target stimulus. In parallel to the response elicitation process, a conscious representation of primes and targets emerges, which can be subject to visual masking processes. However, the conscious representation of the stimuli doesn't play any role for the motor processes in the current experimental trial. =Action trigger account= The action trigger account was developed by Wilfried Kunde, Andrea Kiesel, and Joachim Hoffmann at the University of W√ºrzburg, Germany.Kiesel, A., Kunde, W., & Hoffmann, J.: Mechanisms of subliminal response priming. In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology, Nr. 1-2, 2007, p. 307-315. This account assumes that responses to unconscious primes are neither elicited by semantic analysis of the primes nor by pre-established stimulus-response mappings. Instead, it is assumed that the prime fits a pre-existing action release condition, eliciting the assigned response like a key opening a lock. This happens in two consecutive steps. In the first step, action triggers are held active in working memory that fit the respective task and are able to elicit a specific motor response. Action triggers are established in the instruction and practice phase of the experiment. In the second step, called online stimulus processing, an upcoming stimulus is compared to the action release conditions. If the stimulus fits the trigger conditions, the action triggers automatically execute the response. As an example, the participant's task might be to indicate whether a visually presented number is smaller or larger than five, such that the left-hand key is pressed for numbers \\"1\\" to \\"4\\" and the right- hand key is pressed for numbers \\"6\\" to \\"9\\". Based on the instruction, action triggers are set up that automatically elicit the response assigned to the prime or target number. One important prediction of this theory is that responses can be elicited by primes that meet the trigger conditions but never actually occur as targets. Again, the conscious representation of the stimulus plays no role for motor activation; however, it can lead to a strategic adjustment of response criteria in later trials (e.g., by choosing to respond more slowly to avoid errors). In sum, this theory can be viewed as expanding on the concept of direct parameter specification by focusing on the exact conditions that lead to response priming. =Rapid-chase theory= Fig. 4: A schematic depiction of rapid-chase theory. Primes and targets are engaged in a chase through the visuomotor system (from visual to motor areas). Because the prime signal has a head-start over the target signal, it is able to start a motor response assigned to it and to control this response for as long as the prime-target SOA allows. When the actual target signal then arrives in the motor system, it can follow through with the response already activated by the prime (in consistent trials) or has to reverse the response (in inconsistent trials). Rapid-chase theory assumes that primes and targets elicit feedforward cascades of neuronal activation traversing the visuomotor system in strict sequence, without mixture or overlap of prime and target signals. Therefore, the initial motor response to the prime must be independent of all stimulus aspects of the actual target. The rapid-chase theory of response priming was proposed in 2006 by Thomas Schmidt, Silja Niehaus, and Annabel Nagel. It ties the direct parameter specification model to findings that newly occurring visual stimuli elicit a wave of neuronal activation in the visuomotor system, which spreads rapidly from visual to motor areas of the cortex.Bullier, J.: Integrated model of visual processing. In: Brain Research Reviews, Nr. 36, 2001, p. 96-107.Lamme, V. A. F., & Roelfsema, P. R.: The distinct modes of vision offered by feedforward and recurrent processing. In: Trends in Neurosciences, Nr. 23, 2000, p. 571-579.Thorpe, S. J., Fize, D., & Marlot, C.: Speed of processing in the human visual system. In: Nature, Nr. 381, 1996, p. 520-522.VanRullen, R. & Thorpe, S. J.: Surfing a spike wave down the ventral stream. In: Vision Research, Nr. 42, p. 2593-2615. Because the wavefront of activity spreads very fast, Victor Lamme and Pieter Roelfsema from the University of Amsterdam have proposed that this wave starts as a pure feedforward process (feedforward sweep): A cell first reached by the wavefront has to pass on its activity before being able to integrate feedback from other cells. Lamme and Roelfsema assume that this kind of feedforward processing is not sufficient to generate visual awareness of the stimulus: For this, neuronal feedback and recurrent processing loops are required that link widespread neuronal networks. According to rapid-chase theory, both primes and targets elicit feedforward sweeps that traverse the visuomotor system in rapid succession until they reach motor areas of the brain. There, motor processes are elicited automatically and without the need for a conscious representation. Because the prime signal has a head-start over the target signal, primes and targets are engaged in a \\"rapid chase\\" through the visuomotor system. Because the prime signal reaches the motor cortex first, it is able to activate the motor response assigned to it. The shorter the prime- target SOA, the quicker the target can start the pursuit. When the target signal finally arrives at the motor cortex, it can continue the response process elicited by the prime (if prime and target are consistent) or redirect the response process (if prime and target are inconsistent). This explains why response priming effects increase with prime-target SOA: the longer the SOA, the more time for the prime signal to control the response on its own, and the further the response activation process can proceed in the direction of the prime. Under some circumstances, the prime can also provoke a response error (leading to the characteristic priming effects in error rates). Such a time- course of sequential motor control by primes and targets was described in 2003 by Dirk Vorberg and coworkers in a mathematical model and fits the time-course of primed motor potentials in the EEG. Klotz, W., Heumann, M., Ansorge, U., & Neumann, O. : Electrophysiological activation by masked primes: Independence of prime-related and target-related activities. In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology. Nr. 3, 2007, p. 449‚Äì465. According to rapid-chase theory, response priming effects are independent of visual awareness because they are carried by rapid feedforward processes whereas the emergence of a conscious representation of the stimuli is dependent on slower, recurrent processes. The most important prediction of rapid-chase theory is that the feedforward sweeps of prime and target signals should occur in strict sequence. This strict succession should be observable in the time-course of the motor response, and there should be an early phase where the response is controlled exclusively by the prime and is independent of all properties of the actual target stimulus. One way to check these predictions is to examine the time-course of primed pointing responses. It has been shown that these pointing responses start at a fixed time after presentation of the prime (not the actual target) and start to proceed in the direction specified by the prime. If prime and target are inconsistent, the target is often able to reverse the pointing direction \\"on the fly\\", directing the response into the correct direction. However, the longer the SOA, the longer the time where the finger is moving in the direction of the misleading prime. Schmidt, Niehaus, and Nagel (2006) could show that the earliest phase of primed pointing movements exclusively depends on properties of the prime (e.g., the color contrast of red vs. green primes), but is independent of all properties of the target (its time of occurrence, its color contrast, and its ability to mask the prime). These findings could be confirmed with different methods and different types of stimuli. Because rapid-chase theory views response priming as a feedforward process, it maintains that priming effects occur before recurrent and feedback activity take part in stimulus processing. The theory therefore leads to the controversial thesis that response priming effects are a measure of preconscious processing of visual stimuli, which may be qualitatively different from the way those stimuli are finally represented in visual awareness.

He played for several Minor League Baseball (MiLB) teams between 1970 and 1976, arriving in Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1972 for four games with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was officially listed as standing and weighing , during his playing days. He is the brother of pitcher Kelly Downs. Early life Downs was born in Logan, Utah on June 21, 1952. He attended Viewmont High School in Bountiful, Utah, one of six baseball players drafted from that institution. He was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies with the sixth pick of the sixth round (128th overall) of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft. Baseball career =1970-1971: Walla Walla and Spartanburg= At 18 years old, Downs was assigned to the low-A level Walla Walla Phillies of the Northwest League, where he posted a 5-7 win‚Äìloss record in 14 games played (all starts); his seven losses were the highest total on that year's team. In 80 innings pitched, Downs collected a 5.62 earned run average (ERA), walking 26 batters and allowing 103 hits. He was promoted to the Spartanburg Phillies in 1971, a member of the A-level Western Carolinas League. Downs amassed a 5-4 record in 12 starts with Spartanburg, walking 28 batters in 65 innings. He notched a 4.43 ERA and allowed only two home runs in his tenure. =1972: Reading and Philadelphia= Downs moved up to the AA- level Reading Phillies of the Eastern League for the 1972 season. As a hitter, he batted .167 with one double and one home run, scoring seven runs. On the mound, he started 26 games, comping a 15-7 record with 15 complete games. He struck out 96 batters and walked 40 in 183 innings, earning a promotion to the major league club in Philadelphia. Downs made his major league debut on September 2 at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in the second game of a doubleheader against the Atlanta Braves. He allowed his first hit to the opposing pitcher, Mike McQueen, in the third inning of the game. Downs allowed eight hits in the contest, walking one batter and striking out two; he pitched a complete-game shutout to earn his first major league victory. He started again for the Phillies on September 8, pitching seven innings and allowing the first runs of his career on a two-run home run by Billy Williams of the Chicago Cubs. He did not earn a decision in the game, as the Phillies lost, 4-3. Downs took his first loss against the New York Mets on September 13, allowing three runs in three innings pitched; the game's winner was future Phillie Tug McGraw. He pitched in one more game for the Phillies, a four- inning start against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 19, before he injured his shoulder and was deactivated for the season. =Return to the minors= After spending the 1973 season on the disabled list, Downs was sent back to the minor leagues. In the spring of 1974, he underwent an \\"exploratory surgery\\" to enlarge the groove in his shoulder by removing a piece of the tendons. He started six games for the Rocky Mount Phillies in 1974, winning two games and losing one while amassing a 5.10 ERA. Downs did not pitch in 1975, but returned in 1976 with Spartanburg. He collected a team-worst 9.39 ERA with a 1-6 record in 46 innings before shutting down for the year. Downs was invited to Phillies spring training for the 1977 season, but opted to retire instead of reporting. Pitching style Downs threw four pitches: a standard four-seam fastball, a changeup, a curveball, and a slider, whose development he credited to his Spartanburg manager--Hall of Famer, Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame member, and perfect game pitcher Jim Bunning. He added the slider on promotion to Reading in 1972 and claimed that Bunning gave him \\"the confidence that I can get it over any time I need to\\".

History A building was built in the 13th century by the Bissetts, it came into the hands of the Chisholms in the 15th century, by the marriage of Alexander de Chisholme to Margaret, Lady of Erchless, and became their ancestral home.

It reflects Iggy and Bowie's growing fascination with the German music scene, and bears marked similarities to \\"Lila Engel\\" by Neu!. It has since been covered by multiple artists including Blondie, Boy George, Bebe Buell, R.E.M. and The Cars.  Composition  Iggy had the idea for the song after hearing the Sex Pistols cover the song \\"No Fun\\" by his band The Stooges, lyrically the song's ironic take on fun is similar to the song in question. David Bowie wrote the music as well as plays guitar, synthesizers, piano and sings the main chorus on the track. Most notably one of the riffs he plays is a parody of the main riff of The Rolling Stones' \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\"  Use in media  The song was used in the movie The Hunger along with the song \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" by goth rock band Bauhaus, whose frontman Peter Murphy later covered \\"Funtime\\". The Hunger also stars the co-writer of \\"Funtime\\", David Bowie.  Details  Following its studio appearance on The Idiot, a live version of \\"Funtime\\" was included on Pop's TV Eye Live 1977. Pop also performed the song on the television show Dinah! in 1977 with Bowie accompanying on keyboards and backing vocal. During the sessions for 1981's Shake It Up, members of The Cars recorded a version of \\"Funtime\\" featuring bassist Benjamin Orr on vocals. According to Brett Milano's liner notes for Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology, Pop was present at the recording session and complimented Orr's vocal impersonation of him, telling the bassist \\"You sound more like me than me.\\" The song was later stripped of Orr's vocals and re-sung by fashion model Bebe Buell, whom Cars singer Ric Ocasek had befriended. The version with Buell's vocals was included on her 1981 EP Covers Girl; the Cars version was released on 1995's Just What I Needed anthology. Former Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy included a cover of \\"Funtime\\" on his 1988 album Love Hysteria. In 1989, R.E.M. released their own version as the B-side to the Green track \\"Get Up\\". A live version of \\"Funtime\\" was also recorded by R.E.M. on November 19, 1992, and included on 1995's Strange Currencies EP. A fifteen-minute live medley of T.

AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the medley as a highlight of the disc. English pop singer Boy George released a cover of \\"Funtime\\" as the lead track on his 1995 album Cheapness and Beauty; AllMusic reviewer William Ruhlmann described George's cover as \\"a screaming guitar rock version.\\" A music video was created for the song and it was released as a single, reaching number 45 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1995 and number 60 in Australia in June 1995.

Eddie is the father of Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) and Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas). Along with his children, Eddie was introduced to bring a \\"new generation\\" of the Moon family to the programme. Essex began filming in April 2011 and first appeared on screen on 3 June 2011. His initial contract ended in August, and Essex hoped he would be able to return to the role. The character has been described as cheeky, likeable and charismatic, and has a dark past. Through the series' narrative, it is revealed that there is a rift between Michael and Eddie, because Michael blames his father for the death of his mother, who killed herself when Michael was left alone with her. Eddie is also a love interest for Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and Vanessa Gold (Z√∂e Lucker). Critics have responded mostly positively to the character. Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror praised his \\"grand entrance\\" to the series, and a reporter from the Evening Chronicle said Eddie would bring a \\"breath of fresh air\\" to the soap. However, Jim Shelley from the Daily Mirror branded the character a \\"cliche\\". The character was written out in September 2011 and departed on 6 October 2011. Storylines Eddie is first seen reading a newspaper mentioning his second cousin Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) and decides to visit as he has not seen him for 15 years and wants to see Alfie's son, Tommy, but is hit by Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) car outside The Queen Victoria public house. When he comes to, he argues with Carol and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) asks who he is. At that point, Alfie enters and recognises Eddie. Kat does not want Eddie to stay as she does not want him to know that Michael is Tommy's birth father. Michael sees Eddie in the pub but leaves immediately as he does not want to speak to him. Alfie later tells Eddie that Tommy is his grandson. The next day, Eddie and Carol talk but he defends his son when she says she thinks Michael has a mean streak. He gives Kat some money for Tommy before leaving but does not go far and bonds with Carol's grandson, Liam Butcher (James Forde). Kat finds Eddie and invites him to stay. They visit Michael's boxing club where he tells Michael that he should have told him Tommy is his grandson. Michael, however, gives Eddie money and tells him to take his family far away. Eddie asks what it will take for him to get over what happened, and later tells Michael's girlfriend Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) that he does not remember why they fell out. Roxy and Eddie bond and Michael is annoyed. Michael repeatedly tells Eddie to stay away from him, Tommy and Roxy but Kat tells him he can stay for as long as he wants. Michael tells Roxy that Eddie murdered his mother, Maggie. Eddie confirms this but says he was not there when she died but left Michael with her (he was then 6 years old), knowing he shouldn't. She died of an overdose and Michael blames him. He later helps Carol fix a blocked sink at the caf√© and she invites him for tea after he bonds further with Liam. Liam skips school and Eddie helps him with a hobby. Carol is annoyed that Liam did not go to school but thanks Eddie for spending time with Liam by kissing him. Eddie's son, Tyler (Tony Discipline), arrives in Walford and makes Eddie miss meeting Michael to try to make amends. Michael refuses to accept Eddie's apology. Eddie sends Kat and Alfie on holiday to Spain and runs the pub in their absence. He teaches Liam about antiques but considers returning to Upton Park as he hasn't seen anywhere to move his business to. When Carol discovers that Eddie has allowed Liam to skip school, they argue and Carol tells him to stay away from her and Liam. Eddie discovers that someone is squatting in a local lock-up and decides to take over the premises. Eddie asks Liam to watch his stock, which he leaves in the gardens. Eddie's son, Anthony (Matt Lapinskas), poses as a member of the council to force the squatter out. Eddie returns to find his stock on fire and cannot extinguish the flames. He confronts Michael, thinking he started the fire, but Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) told Liam that she was responsible in revenge for comments Anthony and Tyler made about her grandfather Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick). Eddie finds out it was Lola and confronts her. Eddie and Michael seemingly make amends but Eddie is unaware that Michael has a plan. He later gets a letter that intrigues Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and she becomes fascinated by Eddie. When she tells him she knows his secret, that he wears silk underwear, Eddie assumes she read the letter and shouts at her. Eddie moves into a house on Albert Square and tells Michael that he likes Carol. They are set up by Eddie's sons to spend time alone and are caught under a blanket by Tyler and Anthony. When Vanessa Gold (Z√∂e Lucker) is humiliated after Max's affair with his ex-wife, Eddie is kind to her and Michael takes the opportunity to pay Vanessa to break Eddie's heart and she accepts. Eventually, Eddie and Vanessa sleep together but she starts to like him for real. She finds out Tyler is entering an unlicensed boxing match, and tells Eddie. Despite his anger, he supports Tyler after Michael convinces him there will be a proper doctor and referee present. Carol sees Eddie and Vanessa together, and after Tyler wins the fight, he collapses and suffers a seizure. Eddie then finds out that Anthony bet ¬£8000 from the business on Tyler to lose. Eddie tells Anthony he wishes Anthony was the one in hospital instead of Tyler. When Eddie speaks to Michael, Michael blames Eddie for the events because Tyler worships is father. Michael then tells Eddie he knows about Eddie's other child after finding a photograph of Eddie, a woman and a baby with a date of birth on the back, and says that Eddie cheated on his mother, causing her to kill herself. Eddie then speaks to Carol and she rejects him, calling him a monster for cheating with Vanessa. Eddie then promises Michael he will tell him the truth about everything. It transpires that Maggie had hoped Michael would find her and save her life. Michael and Eddie then make amends until Vanessa, with whom Eddie now has a relationship, reveals that Michael paid her to break his heart and arranged Tyler's fight so Tyler would end up hurt. Eddie later reveals this to Tyler and Anthony, who turn against Michael, and Michael is left distraught. Eddie convinces Vanessa to steal cash from Michael, planning to move to Spain with his family. However, Tyler and Anthony refuse to leave and Eddie dumps Vanessa, telling her the police are looking for her. Eddie then collects Craig and they go to Spain to meet Frankie, Eddie's daughter. Several months later, it is mentioned that Eddie has no money. He also refuses to attend Michael's wedding to Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) in June 2012 or Michael's funeral in November 2013. Creation On 24 January 2011, it was announced that Essex had been cast in the role of Eddie, the father of Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd). It was stated that Eddie's other children would arrive after him, and his \\"fractured\\" relationship with Michael would be explored. Of his role, Essex said, \\"Being an East-Ender myself, I'm really excited to be joining the Square. Eddie Moon is a great character and I can't wait to get to grips with the role and work with such a fantastic cast. I'm really pleased that I've been able to make filming work around my tour dates this time.\\" Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said that Essex would \\"bring warmth and charisma to the role of Eddie Moon\\" and added that Eddie and the return of Michael will bring \\"a new generation of the Moon family to Walford.\\" Essex had been cast as Jack Edwards six years previously, but withdrew from the role due to a clash with his touring schedule. He revealed \\"[T]he character [...] wasn't as interesting as this one. I think we would've made something out of it, but there's much more texture and weight to this.\\" On 27 February 2011, Essex told Elaine Paige on Sunday that he would start filming as Eddie in April and that the character and his storylines were being brainstormed. He revealed that his initial contract would end in August 2011 and although he could stay on longer, he said there are other acting and touring projects \\"pulling me out of EastEnders, but emotionally, I'm here.\\" He later revealed that Eddie would remain on screen until October. He hoped that he could return and become a regular returning character, joking that he would be an \\"occasional Mooner\\", but later he ruled out a return to the show. He said that joining the cast was \\"daunting\\" and a \\"great adventure\\" that was \\"taking over [his] life\\", and because he was writing a film score at the same time as filming for EastEnders, it was \\"tricky\\" and he found it difficult to adjust. Eddie's sons, Tyler (Tony Discipline) and Anthony (Matt Lapinskas), were announced on 10 May 2011, and Kirwood said that the Moon family were \\"on their way to becoming an established family in the Square.\\" Kirkwood later said, \\"[Essex] is a legend in his own right. I can't wait for the audience reaction when he hits the screens in a few weeks. I'm hoping viewers come to love him.\\" Essex said that he was determined to show off his acting skills and explained: \\"It's important to me that Eddie is a character and not David Essex. Because of my track record it might be difficult for some people to differentiate the two, and that's going to be a challenge. But my fans are thrilled I've joined EastEnders‚Äîit means that they get to see me on the telly rather than waiting for my next tour!\\" However, Essex admitted, \\"Eddie Moon is not a million miles from David Essex\\", saying that he had tweaked the character's accent and had brought some of himself into the role. Essex made his first on-screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 3 June 2011. Alt URL Characterisation Eddie is described as a \\"loveable rogue\\" who is cheeky, likeable and charismatic. The EastEnders website says he has a dark past that he is trying to escape, and calls him a polite gentleman who makes friends for life, and is popular with the ladies. Essex said that when Eddie was younger, he would have been a \\"mirror image\\" of Michael, but has since become more philosophical, and is less hot headed than Michael. Essex told Digital Spy that Eddie is \\"a strong character\\", who is an ex-boxer. Essex said Eddie's chequered past would unfold and opined that \\"He's not a bad guy\\". He also explained that Eddie is separated from his wife, and that Tyler and Anthony are Michael's half brothers. Eddie works as an antiques dealer and also has a daughter, Francesca, referred to as Frankie in the series. Storyline development Essex has said that there is a \\"massive rift\\" between Eddie and his estranged son, Michael. He explained: \\"When [Eddie] arrives, he has no idea that Michael is around! Eddie and Michael haven't really spoken for years, but as a father does, Eddie reaches out and reaches out, trying to mend that.\\" Essex opined that Eddie and Michael may be quite similar, but Eddie would not be as manipulative as \\"the ages are different‚Äîwith age comes a certain attitude for Eddie that's a bit more philosophical and not so hot- headed.\\" It was revealed by Inside Soap that the rift between Michael and Eddie is because Michael's mother committed suicide and Michael found her body but he is convinced that Eddie killed her. Essex confirmed that Michael blames Eddie for the death. Eddie and Carol meet in Eddie's second episode when he arrives in Walford and she hits him with her car. Essex explained: \\"Afterwards, Eddie and Carol have a bit of a discussion about that‚Äîshe reckons that she just nudged him, but he reckons that she hit him! We see Eddie get thrown up into the air in that scene. I've done my own stunts for films in the past, but I didn't do that one!\\" A source told The Sun that Eddie and Carol are attracted to each other but they are both too busy to start a relationship, though Carol is flattered when Eddie makes a move on her and their relationship could develop at a later time. Essex told Soaplife: \\"There's a spark between [Eddie] and Carol. He starts off pushing her away but they get closer when he helps out with Liam. Carol thanks Eddie and he kisses her.\\" Reception Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, \\"Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [suit] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks like he could have been a guest at a Big, Fat Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex[.]\\" Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, \\"on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative Who Has Never Been Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week ticking off the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver- tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)\\" A reporter from the Metro called the character \\"mischievous\\", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him \\"a pleasant, charming character\\", adding \\"It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while. [...] [A]s far as I can tell, [he] will be a breath of fresh air in a soap that sometimes forgets to have a laugh.\\" Inside Soap held a poll to see which of the new Moon family members, Eddie, Tyler or Anthony, its readers were most looking forward to seeing. Eddie came first in the poll with 74% of the votes. Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap praised Eddie, saying, \\"If there's one thing EastEnders has been missing recently, it's a strong patriarch to go up against Walford's gobby ladies. Enter David Essex as charming Eddie Moon‚Äîwhose presence has caused something of a stir among [viewers].\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (2011) References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2011 Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Eddie Moon"},{"id":"30602190","text":"Uremic fetor is a urine-like odor on the breath of people with uremia.

The essay mentions how Stevens' breakthrough in the music industry came with the release of \\"Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving Fast- Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills\\" and then his next hit \\"Ahab the Arab\\" helped establish him as a singer and songwriter of the music genres of comedy and novelty.

It is located southwest of the Santa Rosa Island dock, California. It was closed in 1963. History Santa Rosa Island AFS was one of 28 stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary‚Äôs approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. Santa Rosa Island AFS was one of two offshore radar stations built off the Southern California coast, the other being on San Clemente Island. The 669th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was initially assigned by the 27th Air Division to Santa Rosa AFS on 11 February 1952. The squadron initially used an AN/CPS-6B radar which allowed for the shutdown of the temporary Lashup sites at Camp Cooke (L-41) and Port Hueneme (L-42), and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Later in 1952 the squadron received two AN/FPS-10 radars at this island location. In 1955 the Air Force added an AN/FPS-3 search radar to the facility. During the following year, an AN/GPS-3 search radar was also added. 1958 saw the addition of an AN/MPS-14 long-range height-finder radar. In 1958, plans were made to relocate the 669th AC&W; Sq from Santa Rosa Island to the mainland. Operations ceased on 31 March 1963 due to budget reductions, and the squadron moved to Lompoc AFS (RP-15), where support could be provided to the site by Vandenberg AFB. Today the site of the former Santa Rosa Island Air Force Station has been obliterated, the land returned to its natural state by the National Park Service.

Much of its criticism was directed towards the game's intentional lack of much initial content due to its DLC-oriented structure. In particular, Computer and Video Games felt that the business model was interesting, but made the resulting game \\"overly minimal to point of it feeling like a rip off despite the slightly lower price tag.\\" GameZone gave the game a 7.5/10, considering it to be \\"an enjoyable, competent off-road racer that succeeds due to its impressive style but struggles from some glaring limitations.\\" While its overall gameplay was considered to be enjoyable and comparable to an arcade-style game, graphical glitches were seen once in a while, and the lack of courses resulting from their slow unlock time led to a repetitive experience.

During the war, in 1943, Moltke twice tried without success to contact Kirk, whom he trusted as an intermediary between the German opposition and the Allies.Motlke, 317n, 372n In August 1939, the journalist Louis P. Lochner showed Kirk the text of the Obersalzberg speech, asking him to transmit back to Washington, but Kirk was not interested, leading Louchner to turn next to the British diplomat George Ogilvie-Forbes who did indeed transmit it back to London.von Klemperer, Klemens The German Resistance Against Hitler: The Search for Allies Abroad, 1938-1945, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993 p.133. During the Danzig crisis, Kirk found playing himself a bit role. On 24 August 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent telegrams to both Adolf Hitler and President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki appealing to them to find a compromise to end the crisis.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p 560. Hitler chose not to reply, but Mo≈õcicki wrote back that his nation was not the one \\"formulating demands and demanding concessions\\", but stated he willing to open negotiations with the Reich on the status of the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk, Poland).Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p 560.

As Hitler refused to see him, he instead met on the evening of 26 August with the State Secretary of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, Baron Ernst von Weizs√§cker.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p 561 Kirk argued to Weizs√§cker that since for the first time, the Poles were willing to open talks on changing the status of Danzig, which might allow Danzig to \\"go home to the Reich\\", that this represented a potential breakthrough on finding a peaceful solution to the crisis.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p 561 Weizs√§cker replied he would pass on Kirk's note for \\"the consideration of the Foreign Minister\\", and was otherwise evasive about what his government was planning to do in response.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p 561 Kirk served briefly as Embassy Counselor in Rome before becoming Minister to Egypt in 1941,New York Times: \\"Nelson and Landis Reach Cairo by Air,\\" October 6, 1943, accessed January 23, 2011; Foreign Service List, 1942, 10 when Time magazine described him as \\"smooth, spare.\\"TIME: Foreign Relations: Winant to London,\\" February 17, 1941, accessed January 23, 2011 From March 29, 1941, to March 29, 1944, Kirk served as Ambassador to Egypt, first as head of the U.S. Legation and then of the Embassy. King Farouk of Egypt had a strong dislike of homosexuals, and Kirk's relations with the king were distant.Stadiem, William Too Rich, p.216 By contrast, Kirk was close to Farouk's archenemy, the British ambassador, Sir Miles Lampson, which made for further difficulties as Kirk tended to back Lampson in his dealings with the king.Stadiem, William Too Rich, p.216 Kirk took the view that it was crucial that the British 8th Army stop the advance of the German Afrika Korps, and given Farouk's pro-Axis sympathies, Lampson's high-handed treatment of the king was necessary. He advised the State Department in 1941 that a Jewish state \\"is incapable of realization in the future unless imposed by force on an unwilling native population.\\" Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles did not share his assessment and did not forward Kirk's views to the White House.Lawrence Davidson, \\"Review: Sympathy for Jewish Statehood,\\" in Journal of Palestine Studies, vol. 15, no. 1, Autumn 1985, 134 Drawing on his experience with Nazi propaganda and antisemitism in Germany, Kirk expanded the embassy's coverage of Radio Berlin's Arabic-language broadcasts, providing complete translations of what came to be known as the \\"Axis Broadcasts in Arabic\\" along with his weekly analysis from 1941 to 1944, which Hull circulated widely. He dissected the Nazis' manipulation of anti-colonial, anti-Jewish, and anti-Bolshevik sentiment and their charges that Roosevelt and Churchill were being manipulated by their Jewish supporters.Jeffrey Herf, Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), 10‚Äì1, 72‚Äì3, 86, 97‚Äì9, 101‚Äì2, 106, 217 At the beginning of his Cairo tenure, Kirk focused on the strategic necessity of Allied victory in the Middle East because it would be impossible to counter the Nazi's exploitation of an Axis victory in its propaganda. Once the Allies won control of the region, he stressed political analysis and repeatedly underscored the critical role of the Egyptian capital in Arab nationalism.Herf, Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World, 70‚Äì1, 127, 140‚Äì1 As Kirk looked to the end of the war, he anticipated a post-colonial world in which nations operated freely in a free enterprise environment, unlike Secretary of State Cordell Hull who expected the persistence of traditional spheres of influence, notably that of Great Britain in Egypt.Nancy E. Gallagher, \\"Anglo-American Rivalry and the Establishment of a Medical Research Institute in Egypt, 1942‚Äì1948,\\" in International History Review, vol. 9, no. 2, May 1987, 292; Barry Rubin, \\"Anglo-American Relations in Saudi Arabia, 1941‚Äì45,\\" in Journal of Contemporary History, vol. 14, no. 2, April 1979, 255 While posted to Cairo, Kirk kept one house in the city for lunch, another near the pyramids for dinner and sleeping, and a houseboat on the Nile. As ambassador, Kirk was noted for his eccentricities such as wearing lavender silk tuxedos; maintaining a houseboat on the Nile flamboyantly decorated with white ostrich feathers and a framed picture of his mother with candles burning around it; and his insistence on only drinking milk from an Egyptian water buffalo he adopted and named after his mother.Stadiem, William Too Rich, p.216 Even through Kirk was as openly gay as it was possible to be in the 1940s, he was popular with the diplomatic corps in Cairo, who liked him for his charm, and his frequent parties on his houseboat were always well attended.Stadiem, William Too Rich, p.216 He hosted FDR, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek at the second house for the November 1943 Cairo Conference. He has been described as \\"an archeological dilettante\\" who liked to lecture his guests as they gazed at the pyramids. Clare Boothe Luce claimed to have flummoxed him by pre-empting his performance by asking: \\"Mr. Ambassador, what are those strange-looking objects?\\"Stephen Shadegg, Claire Boothe Luce (NY: Simon & Schuster, 1970), 149 Along with several military men Kirk devised the successful plan to attack Rommel's communications instead of his ground forces.

When the American Office of War Information produced an Italian-language publication, Kirk insisted it be labeled propaganda to maintain a clear distinction between what Italians were accomplishing for themselves or not. In August 1945, he received petitions from Soviet prisoners of war, taken by the Germans and liberated by Allied forces. They wrote to him in his role as Political Advisor to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and claimed the status of \\"political refugees\\" and asked \\"in the name of humanity\\" not to be repatriated to the Soviet Union. Kirk wrote to Secretary of State Byrnes seeking guidance, a diplomatic way of expressing his reservations about the repatriation policy. He was instructed to make certain none of the prisoners was actually from Poland or the Baltic States and to proceed with the repatriations.Cathal J. Nolan, \\"Americans in the Gulag: Detention of US Citizens by Russia and the Onset of the Cold War, 1944‚Äì49,\\" in Journal of Contemporary History, vol. 25, no. 4, October 1990, 532‚Äì3 Kirk was long famous for entertaining and continued even when forced to operate in Rome \\"under a wartime minimum.\\" Six or eight guests joined him for lunch or dinner, often many more. One Friday lunch he hosted about 20 enlisted men. Though some involved in recruiting the guests worried that a Negro corporal might not be well received, Kirk gave him the place of honor on his right. Life described him near the end of his career: \\"To call Kirk an ornament of the State Department is almost a libelous understatement....Kirk's true value resides in the fact that he is an American who, far from being an innocent abroad, knows Europe infinitely better than most Europeans. This makes him almost unique in the current roster of U.S. foreign representatives in the diplomatic, charitable, or didactic spheres. Kirk's career should be studied in detail, like The Education of Henry Adams.\\" Fortune in July 1946 called him \\"foppish, intelligent, and very rich.\\"John Lamberton Harper, America and the Reconstruction of Italy, 1945‚Äì1948 (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 17, 171n33, available online, accessed August 29, 2014 Kirk predicted in 1945 that future diplomats should be technical experts \\"chosen for the ability not only to diagnose economic, industrial and political trends, but also to adjust their dislocations before they can start wars.\\" He lamented the willingness of governments to spend on wars far more than on the diplomacy that might prevent them. A few years after Kirk's retirement, as Senator Joseph McCarthy launched a campaign against suspected homosexuals in government, one investigator's 1948 report charged that State Department employees Carmel Offie and Charles W. Thayer \\"were very close personal friends of former Ambassador Alexander Kirk who is not now in the service but who had a very bad reputation of being a homosexual and certainly protected a lot of homosexual people.\\"Robert D.

Busch, \\"Alexander Kirk,\\" August 13, 1945, accessed January 23, 2011 When Life profiled him in 1945, it reported that he had always established fine residences wherever he was posted: \\"The Ambassador is fond of houses, and especially big ones. Equipped with ample private funds and the courage of his complexes, Kirk sees no reason why he should not capitalize the chance his profession gives him to indulge this fondness, all the more since such indulgence usually works out to the benefit of the State Department in one way or another.\\" His nickname around this time was \\"Buffy.\\"Robert P. Newman, The Cold War Romance of Lillian Hellman and John Melby (University of North Carolina Press, 1989), 77 In 1945 he attributed \\"his excellent health to the fact that he has never worn himself down by any form of exercise more violent than scratching, which he only does when suffering from insomnia at 6 a.m.\\" He planned to retire to Arizona and bought a piece of land in the White Mountains at the end of World War II. He joked that he would live there not in a house but in a cave. Another diplomat reported that he retired to the mountains of Colorado and \\"amused himself operating a ranch and raising cattle\\" for a few years before relocating to Texas. His sister Gertrude Kirk Metzeroff died in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1948 at the age of 84.

Kennan sketched an affectionate portrait of Kirk, as he knew him in Berlin before America entered World War II: \\"a confirmed bachelor, profoundly saddened by the recent death of an adored mother who, while she was alive, had preempted much of both his companionship and his emotional life, Kirk drowned the inner emptiness in the performance of his arduous official duties,\\" sleeping in an office alcove while working 16 to 18 hours daily.Kennan, 112 He continued:Kennan, 113‚Äì5 Kirk claimed he escaped from diplomatic functions by whatever ruse the situation required. At one embassy in Rome he found it necessary to leave by a door he could only reach by going under a grand piano. \\"In a case of this sort, Kirk recommends slow motion, which, he says, often prevents witnesses from even noticing a maneuver which, if executed fast, might horrify them.\\" He insisted his favorite color was gray. He never had fresh flowers, rather he collected artificial ones in his favorite color. His wardrobe and household were maintained by a servant named Mario, who joined the Kirk household in Mexico early in Kirk's career and continued through his stint as ambassador in Rome.

Les Prix Thematiques en Sciences de l'Univers , French Academy of Sciences website, accessed 23 January 2011 The award was founded in 1886, though the first medal was not awarded until a year later. The commission formed to decide on the first recipient of the medal selected the German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff for his work on the science of spectroscopy. However, Kirchhoff died aged 63 on 17 October 1887, a few months before the award would have been announced. Rather than chose a new recipient for the award, the commission announced at the Academy's session of 26 December 1887 that the inaugural medal would be placed on his grave, in \\"supreme honour of the memory of this great scholar of Heidelberg\\".

All of these organizations recommend restricting consumption of saturated fats to reduce that risk. There is moderate quality evidence that reducing the proportion of saturated fat in the diet, and replacing it with unsaturated fats or carbohydrates over a period of at least two years, leads to a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. History =Cholesterol and cardiovascular disease= The initial connection between arteriosclerosis and dietary cholesterol is attributed to the Russian pathologist Nikolay Anichkov, prior to World War I. Dutch physician Cornelis de Langen noted the correlation between nutritional cholesterol intake and incidence of gallstones in Javanese people in 1916. de Langen showed that the traditional Javanese diet, poor in cholesterol and other lipids, was associated with a low level of blood cholesterol and low incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), while the prevalence of CVD in Europeans living in Java on a Western diet was higher. Since de Langen published his results only in Dutch, his work remained unknown to most of the international scientific community until the 1940s and 1950s. =Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease= The hypothesis that saturated fat has a detrimental effect on human health gained prominence in the 1950s as a result of the work of Ancel Keys, a US nutritional scientist. At that time in the USA, the incidence of heart disease was rapidly increasing, for reasons that were not clear. Keys postulated a correlation between circulating cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease, and initiated a study of Minnesota businessmen (the first prospective study of CVD). Keys presented his diet-lipid-heart disease hypothesis at a 1955 expert meeting of the World Health Organization in Geneva.Famous Polemics on Diet-Heart Theory. Henry Blackburn, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota. http://www.epi.umn.edu/cvdepi/essay.asp?id=33 accessed 18th March 2014 In response to criticism at the conference, he set out to conduct the years-long Seven Countries Study. Ancel Keys joined the nutrition committee of the American Heart Association (AHA) and successfully promulgated his idea such that in 1961, with the result that the AHA became the first group anywhere in the world to advise cutting back on saturated fat (and dietary cholesterol) to prevent heart disease. This historic recommendation was reported on the cover of Time Magazine in that same year. Reviews A 2020 review found that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years reduced cardiovascular risk factors, mainly by replacing saturated fat with sources of polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrates. A 2019 meta-analysis found no association between dietary saturated fat intake and risk of cardiovascular diseases, with higher intake of trans fatty acids being associated with greater risk of cardiovascular diseases. A 2017 review by the American Heart Association recommended that decreasing saturated fat intake and increasing consumption of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats could lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases by about 30%. Another 2017 review concluded that replacing saturated fats with mostly omega-6 polyunsaturated fats is unlikely to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) events, CHD mortality or total mortality, indicating that inadequately controlled trials (such as failing to control lifestyle factors) that were included in earlier meta-analyses may explain the prior results.

Interactive Entertainment. In the game, the player controls \\"the Kid\\" as he moves through floating, fantasy-themed environments and fights enemies of various types. It features a dynamic voiceover from a narrator, and is presented as a two-dimensional game with an isometric camera and a hand- painted, colorful art style. Bastions story follows the Kid as he collects special shards of rock to power a structure, the Bastion, in the wake of an apocalyptic Calamity. The game was built over the course of two years by a team of seven people split between San Jose and New York City. They debuted the game at the September 2010 Penny Arcade Expo, and it went on to be nominated for awards at the 2011 Independent Games Festival and win awards at the Electronic Entertainment Expo prior to release. Bastion was published in July 2011 for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade, and in August 2011 through digital distribution for Microsoft Windows on Steam. Supergiant Games made it available as a browser game for Google Chrome in December 2011. It was released for Mac OS X and iOS in 2012, for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in 2015, for Xbox One in 2016, and Nintendo Switch in 2018. Bastions soundtrack was produced and composed by Darren Korb, and a soundtrack album was made available for sale in August 2011. During 2011, the game sold more than 500,000 copies, 200,000 of which were for the Xbox Live Arcade. It sold over three million copies across all platforms by January 2015. The game was widely praised by reviewers, primarily for its story, art direction, narration, and music. Opinions were mixed on the depth of the gameplay, though the variety of options in the combat system was praised. Bastion has won many nominations and awards since its release, including several for best downloadable game and best music, from review outlets such as IGN and Game Informer as well as from the Spike Video Game Awards, the Game Developers Conference, and the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.  Gameplay  alt=An isometric view of a floating, crumbling grass and stone ruin. The silver-haired protagonist is in the center, aiming a bow at an enemy. Bastion is an action role-playing game with a level structure. The player character, \\"the Kid\\", moves through floating, fantasy-themed environments that form paths as the player approaches the edge. Levels consist of a single plane, and are viewed isometrically. They are filled with enemies of various types, which attempt to harm the Kid. The Kid carries two weapons, which may be selected from the choices available to the player at specific locations called arsenals. The Kid also has the ability to perform a special attack. Weapons and special attacks must be acquired before they can be used. There are a limited number of special attacks that the player can perform at any time, represented by \\"black tonics\\" that can be found in the levels or dropped from enemies. Special attacks may be used a total of three times. This maximum number of uses can be increased in the Distillery. The Kid's health is represented by a health bar, which can be replenished with \\"health tonics\\". Like black tonics, the Kid can only carry a certain number of health tonics at a time, and can replenish them by finding more in the levels. Levels contain many different environment types, including cities, forests, and bogs. At the end of most levels, the player collects an item called a core or a shard; occasionally, the level begins to disintegrate once the Kid takes the item, forcing him to hastily retreat. As the player progresses through the levels, a voice narrates their actions. This narration gives scripted plot information as well as dynamic comments, such as on the player's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies. Between levels, the Kid visits the Bastion, where the player can use fragments‚Äîthe game's form of currency‚Äîthat they have accrued to buy materials and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can add one of six structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become stronger and giving the player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are used to determine the Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select. Whenever the player leaves the Bastion, they can choose between one or two regular levels to play. In addition to these levels, however, the Kid can engage in challenge courses designed to test the player's skills with the weapons the player has found. They are called Proving Grounds. The challenges differ depending on the weapon, such as destroying a certain number of objects within a given time or breaking targets in the fewest shots possible. According to the player's score, different tiers of prizes are awarded. Additionally, the Kid can fight waves of enemies while the narrator tells a character's backstory by journeying to \\"Who Knows Where\\" from the Bastion. The back story battles occur during 'Memories.' The player earns fragments and experience for each completed wave. After the game is completed, the player can choose to begin a \\"new game+\\" mode, where the player replays through the game while keeping the experience points, fragments, and weapons that they have gained. This mode also offers more options in the buildings, as well as two more journeys to \\"Who Knows Where\\".  Plot  The game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the city of Caelondia () as well as the surrounding areas of the game's world into many floating pieces, disrupting its ecology and reducing most of its people to ash. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via \\"skyways\\" that propel him through the air. During his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists (\\"Mancers\\") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well. To repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion. After the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no way to test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.  Development  alt=A man wearing a teal hoodie looking to the left. He is seated at a table behind a microphone and water bottles. Bastion was created by a team of seven people, who composed the studio Supergiant Games. It was the company's first game. The game was directed by Amir Rao and Greg Kasavin wrote the game's narration, which was spoken by Logan Cunningham. Jen Zee was the artist, Gavin Simon developed the gameplay, Andrew Wang helped develop the game, and Darren Korb handled the sound effects and music. The co-founders of Supergiant Games, Rao and Simon, previously worked for Electronic Arts, where they helped develop Command & Conquer 3 and Red Alert 3. They left to form the studio because they wanted the development speed and the ability to try new ideas that would be possible with a smaller team. Development began on the game in September 2009. The team created the game over almost two years, and funded the development themselves. Most of the team built the game in a house in San Jose, though the music and voice acting were recorded in New York City. Some of the San Jose designers‚Äîincluding the writer‚Äîdid not meet Rucks' voice actor in person until near the release of the game. The team spent the first nine months of development prototyping various ideas, before settling on the game's design. alt=A man wearing a blue shirt and grey sweater looking to the left. He is standing behind a podium. The original idea was based around the premise of creating a town like those found in a role-playing game. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game, which is usually not possible with an isometric camera, as it always points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground come up to the Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand- painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as typical in isometric games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games. The narrator was added early in the game's development as a way to provide background details and depth to the world without requiring the player to read long strings of text or wait through cutscenes. To avoid slowing the pace of the action-oriented gameplay, the team had the narrator mainly speak in short, evocative phrases, with long pauses between speaking parts. The narrator is intended to feel like an \\"old acquaintance\\" to the player, a connection built by his commentary on the player's actions as they happen, both major and minor. Kasavin sought to make the game feel as if it were the player's story, rather than just a story being watched. The development of Bastion was chronicled in the monthly Building the Bastion video series from October 2010 to May 2011 in which Supergiant Games collaborated with Kasavin's former GameSpot co-workers at Giant Bomb. The videos showed early game concepts in addition to the process of building the final game, as well as interviews with the team. Supergiant Games showed an early, unplayable version of the game at the March 2010 Game Developers Conference, to little acclaim. They debuted a playable version of the game at the September 2010 Penny Arcade Expo, where it was well received. After a strong showing at the March 2011 Game Developers Conference, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment signed on to publish and distribute the game. This publishing agreement lasted until September 2019, when Supergiant Games took over as publisher on all platforms. The team decided to partner with a publisher in order to get through the process of Xbox Live certification. Bastion was released on July 20, 2011 for Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA), and on August 16, 2011 for digital distribution on Windows through Steam. It was released as a browser game for Google Chrome on December 9, 2011. A version for Mac OS X was made available via the Mac App Store on April 26, 2012 along with a SteamPlay update for Mac OS X and Windows. Ports followed for PlayStation 4 on April 7, 2015, PlayStation Vita on December 5, 2015, Xbox One on December 12, 2016, and Nintendo Switch on September 13, 2018. = Music = Bastions soundtrack was produced and composed by Darren Korb, a songwriter and composer. He was selected to pen the soundtrack by Rao, who was a childhood friend of Korb. Bastion was the first video game that Korb had scored; prior to it he had worked on a few smaller television shows and movies. He was brought onto the team in the beginning stages of the project, and several of the pieces he developed were created prior to the final design of the levels with which they were associated. The musical style of the soundtrack has been described by Korb as \\"acoustic frontier trip hop\\". It was intended to evoke both the American frontier and an exotic fantasy world. The songs combine \\"heavily sampled beats in layers, along with acoustic elements\\", and he determined that he wanted to create the soundtrack in that style as it was different from video game soundtracks that he had heard before. The music was recorded in Korb's closet at his New York City apartment, as were the sound effects and more than three thousand lines of narration by Cunningham. In addition to composing the music, Korb wrote all the lyrics for the soundtrack. The soundtrack features four vocal themes: \\"Build That Wall\\", \\"What's Left Undone\\", \\"Mother, I'm Here\\", and \\"Setting Sail, Coming Home\\". \\"Build That Wall\\" features the voice of Ashley Lynn Barrett, \\"What's Left Undone\\" features that of Cunningham and \\"Mother, I'm Here\\" features Korb, and both Korb and Barrett perform in \\"Setting Sail, Coming Home\\". Supergiant Games originally had not planned to release a full soundtrack album for the game, but due to fan demand they released one in digital format on August 5, 2011, with two songs not heard in the game. These songs are \\"Get Used to It\\", which has a voiceover written by Greg Kasavin and spoken by Logan Cunningham, and \\"The Pantheon (Ain't Gonna Catch You)\\", with lyrics written by Korb and sung by Cunningham. A physical limited edition CD signed by Korb was released on September 2. The soundtrack sold 30,000 copies by November 2011. On March 15, 2012, Supergiant Games released sheet music for piano and guitar arrangements by Korb of \\"Build That Wall\\", \\"Mother, I'm Here\\", \\"Setting Sail, Coming Home\\", and \\"The Pantheon (Ain't Gonna Catch You)\\" free in their online store.  Reception  Bastion was released to strong sales and critical acclaim. The game sold more than 500,000 copies during 2011, 200,000 of which were for the Xbox Live Arcade. In March 2013 at the PAX East gaming convention, Bastion's creative director Greg Kasavin stated that the game had sold more than 1.7 million copies combined across all platforms. By May 2014, the game had sold over 2 million copies, and by January 2015, it had sold over 3 million. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com called it \\"the perfect mesh of game and story\\", and McKinley Noble of GamePro said that it \\"raises the visual and narrative bar for downloadable titles\\". Maxwell McGee of GameSpot called it \\"wonderfully crafted\\" and \\"an amazingly good time\\", and Greg Miller of IGN concluded that Bastion \\"is amazing and you owe it to yourself to download it\\". The presentation of the game was widely praised, especially the narration. Mackey said that the game \\"could be sold on its presentation alone\\", focusing on the graphics, music, and story. Edge said that the narration added \\"emotional resonance\\" to the game, and Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer praised the \\"dazzling visuals\\" and \\"artful commentary\\". Game Informers Matt Miller highlighted \\"the well-written narration, excellent music, and bright visuals\\" as factors that made the game feel \\"like a storybook in which you control the outcome.\\" Of the presentation elements, the story was the least praised, though several reviewers such as Noble enjoyed it, saying that it \\"just gets better the further you delve into it.\\" Ryan Scott of GameSpy, however, termed it a \\"just- sorta-there plot\\", and Greg Miller said that it \\"could have been better\\" and never \\"hooked\\" him. Reviewers had a more mixed opinion of the gameplay. Mackey praised the variety of gameplay elements and said that combat has \\"a deceptive amount of depth\\", but Bramwell felt that the combat did not \\"invite experimentation\\" and was somewhat disappointing. Edge said that the gameplay was \\"more interested in variety than challenge\\", for which he praised it, and Matt Miller said that combat was \\"a lot of fun\\", though he felt it lacked \\"the depth, speed, or complexity of a true action game\\". Greg Miller highlighted the variety of the gameplay as the best part of the game, and Scott called it \\"enjoyable\\", though not \\"challenging\\". = Awards = The game won several awards, both before and after publication. It was nominated for the 2011 Independent Games Festival awards at the Game Developers Conference in the Excellence In Visual Art and Excellence In Audio categories. It went on to win the Game Critics Award for Best Downloadable Game of E3 2011, and received a nomination for Best Original Game. The game continued to be nominated for awards after release. It was nominated for the Best Independent Game award at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, and won the Best Original Score and Best Downloadable Game awards, \\"Build That Wall (Zia's Theme)\\" won the Best Song in a Game award, and \\"Setting Sail, Coming Home (End Theme)\\" was nominated for the same award. It was named the Downloadable Title of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and was nominated for their Outstanding Innovation in Gaming award. 1UP.com gave Bastion their Best Narrative in a Game award, and Game Informer gave it the Best RPG Innovation award for the narration in the game. In GameSpot's Game of the Year awards, Bastion won the Song of the Year award for \\"Build That Wall\\" as well as the Readers' Choice award for Best Download-only Console Game. IGN termed it the \\"Best XBLA Game of 2011\\", and RPGamer gave the game their Role-Playing Game of the Year award. Official Xbox Magazine awarded it their Best Music award and nominated it for Best Art Direction, Role-Playing Game of the Year, and XBLA Game of the Year. The music won the Game Audio Network Guild's Best Audio in a Casual/Indie/Social Game award, and Darren Korb was selected as the Rookie of the Year. The game was nominated for the 2012 Game Developers Conference awards in the Innovation, Best Audio, and Best Narrative categories, and won the Best Downloadable Game award. Supergiant Games won the Best Debut award.

It is located south-southwest of Lompoc, California. It was closed in 1968 by the Air Force, and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Ground Equipment Facility G-35. It is also partially used by Air Force Space Command at Vandenberg AFB as a telemetry receiving station. History Lompoc Air Force Station was established to replace Santa Rosa Island AFS due to the high cost of operating the offshore station. It was given the designation \\"RP-15\\" upon its activation on 1 April 1963. Actual construction of the Lompoc AFS began on 1 November 1961 with an expected completion date of 1 September 1962, and an Operational date of 1 July 1963. This new station was planned to be a Long Range Radar Site with a GATR facility. It was programmed to be a split site with the headquarters of the 669th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron and dormitories located on Oak Mountain, about 18 miles south of Vandenberg AFB. The site was activated on 23 June 1962 during the construction period, and other squadron personnel were assigned during the months prior to its formal establishment. Rain damage and other construction problems slowed construction and final acceptance of the site was made in January 1963, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In the early part of 1963, Lompoc AFS was given the added responsibility of having a limited GCI capability in the DMCC room. In addition, the Operational date was moved ahead 3 months to 1 April 1963. Through great teamwork and long hours of duty by members of Western GEEIA, Western Electric, Burroughs and squadron personnel, equipment was installed, aligned and tested and this squadron proudly met its operational date of 1 April 1963. Upon its activation, Lompoc AFS joined Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-17 at Norton AFB, California. With the move of the attending 669th AC&W; Squadron from Santa Rosa AFS, the squadron was re-designated as the 669th Radar Squadron (SAGE). Lompoc's radars provided a complete circle of coverage several hundred miles in radius. Lompoc AFS initially hosted an AN/FPS-67 search radar and an AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar. The Ground Air Transmitting Receiving (GATR) Site (R-22) for communications was located at , approximately 1 mile South from the main site. Normally the GATR site was connected by a pair of buried telephone cables, with a backup connection of dual telephone cables overhead. The Coordinate Data Transmitting Set (CDTS) (AN/FST-2) at the main site converted each radar return into a digital word which was transmitted by the GATR via microwave to the Control Center. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Lompoc AFS was re-designated as NORAD ID Z-15 on 31 July 1963. A second AN/FPS-6 was added in 1964. The 669th was inactivated in June 1968 due to budget reductions and the draw down of the ADC aircraft radar squadrons. However, the Lompoc GATR site (R-22) has been retained, and is now site # G-35. The site also is used as a telemetry site for the Western Test Range at Vandenberg AFB.

The project's aim was to let citizens \\"communicate their views on would-be parolees to the New York State Parole Board.\\" History \\"ParoleWatch will not be the first such site\\" with information on potential parolees, The New York Times reported in April 1997. \\"For almost a year, the New Jersey State Parole Board has published on the Web a list of inmates eligible for parole. But ParoleWatch might well be the first parole Web site published by a private organization.\\" In an article for the KlaasKids Foundation, ParoleWatch's founder predicted that \\"Eventually people in every state will be just a few mouse-clicks away from this kind of data.\\" ParoleWatch was organized by the anti-crime group Take Back New York, and grew out of the group's grass-roots efforts to block the parole of a convicted murderer. The New York State Department of Correctional Services provided the data for ParoleWatch. The New York Times wrote that the project had \\"prominent supporters.\\" New York divorce lawyer Raoul Felder served as chairman of ParoleWatch's advisory board, \\"which also includes several well-known victims' rights advocates.\\" Felder told The Times \\"he backed the project because too often victims receive no notification when offenders are up for parole. 'There is a blank spot in the criminal justice system,' Felder said. 'We put these guys away. They get out and the victims usually have no way of knowing when they get out.' ParoleWatch, he said, 'gives them a fair shot.' According to the New York Post, one effect of ParoleWatch was to turn parole reform into a national issue. Criticism In his book, The Control Revolution: How the Internet is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the World We Know, Andrew L. Shapiro said that ParoleWatch \\"demonstrates much of what is possible when it comes to individuals using interactive technology to transform politics -- and what might go wrong. ... ParoleWatch does a real public service by giving citizens access to data about violent offenders and their release dates.\\" But it prompted \\"people to 'take action'...based on a very limited view of each case.\\" The American Civil Liberties Union had voiced similar criticisms when ParoleWatch was launched. In an interview with Wired, Take Back New York Executive Director Joe Diamond responded to the ACLU's objections by \\"conced[ing] that Parolewatch 'is not overly concerned with the prisoner's point of view.'\\" Shapiro wrote that, as a victims' rights organization, ParoleWatch was \\"fully entitled to express its views on crime and safety\\" and that law-and-order advocates have always \\"had the ability to lobby parole boards.\\" In Shapiro's view, however, there was a danger \\"in ParoleWatch's sophisticated harnessing of new technology. It uses the pinpoint accuracy of a computer database to match citizens in certain neighborhoods with felons who might be released there, and it relies on the Net's interactivity to give folks a free and easy way to voice their opposition -- without having to take time to become well informed, let alone to hear the views of others.\\" Some of the criticism of ParoleWatch was more tongue-in- cheek. \\"A better name for the Web site address is www.rotinjail.com,\\" said activist attorney Ron Kuby.

Franckenstein was born and died in Leipzig; he was the son of the lawyer and historian Christian Gottfried Franckenstein. In August 1713 he acquired a master's degree in philosophy in Leipzig, and in 1719 he received a doctorate in law in Erfurt. From 1721 to 1732 he was professor of natural and international law at the University of Leipzig. In 1722 he was temporarily a Councilor at Zerbst, the seat of government of the Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, but after two years he returned to teaching at the university. In 1731, Zedler asked Franckenstein to be the lead editor of the planned Universal Lexicon. He already had some experience with the book market. He was a colleague and confidant of Professor Johann Burckhardt Mencke, publisher of the journal \\"New Learned Works\\" and other periodicals, a supporter of Zedler's mammoth project.

She was a foundation employee of the US agency Doyle Dane Bernbach from 1949 and was instrumental in that agency's success and growth over the next twenty years. Career Born in New York City, in 1942 Robinson earned a bachelor's degree in sociology in from Barnard College; she wanted to be a writer. She worked for the US government as a statistician during World War II. After the war, she moved to Boston, and embarked on a career in advertising. After starting out at Bresnick & Solomont, she joined Grey Advertising in 1947 writing fashion promotion, where she first worked for William Bernbach. When he and Ned Doyle left Grey in 1949 to start their eponymous agency with Mac Dane their \\"little gold mine of people,\\" included Robinson and the art director Bob Gage with whom she was teamed and would enjoy much creative success. Robinson was Doyle Dane Bernbach's first chief copywriter. At DDB, she supervised a team that would produce a number of notable people in advertising, including Mary Wells Lawrence and Paula Green. Wells described Robinson's place at DDB when Wells arrived there in 1957 \\"By the time I arrived the gods were firmly ensconced, the pantheon was established, the rituals, the sacred writings were already beloved. The Dei Majores were the originals, Bill, Ned, Mac, Phyllis and Bob Gage; they spoke a secret language. There were talented others, the spirits and the elves, but the gods were the gods, everyone in the industry knew who was who\\". Years later Wells put it more simply, \\"I would buy a used car from Phyllis Robinson.\\" Robinson worked on memorable campaigns for numerous clients, including Ohrbach's, Henry S. Levy and Sons ‚Äì \\"You don't have to be Jewish to love Levy's Real Jewish Rye\\", El Al Airlines, and Polaroid with a long running campaign featuring actors James Garner and Mariette Hartley. On the occasion of her death Keith Reinhard, Chairman-Emeritus of DDB Worldwide wrote \\"In presentations to students, I still use her campaigns for Levy's rye bread and Ohrbach's as timeless examples of how to make brands famous by writing in a conversational tone...... [The Ohrbach's ad] is great on its own merits, but the more important reason I singled it out was that, when Volkswagen decided to introduce the Beetle to the U.S. market, they did not conduct an agency search. Instead, they simply said, \\"We want the agency that does Ohrbach's\\" ‚Äì and thus, thanks to Phyllis, the creative revolution was born.\\" http://www.ddb.com/ddblogs/creativity/thank-you-phyllis-robinson.html Reinhard: Thank you Phyllis Robinson Later, she also worked in theater, co- writing the lyrics for Cry for Us All. She also wrote the books, lyrics, and music for a 1995 musical based on Bernard Malamud's short story Angel Levine. Personal life In 1944 she married Dr. Richard G. Robinson, who died in 2005. They had a daughter Nancy. Robinson quit full-time work at DDB in 1962 to raise her daughter, but continued to consult to the agency working three days a week through to 1968. She was 89 when she died in Manhattan. Accolades Robinson was inducted into the Creative Hall of Fame in 1968. For a time she served as chairperson for the Creative Hall of Fame. In 1999, Advertising Age magazine named her one of the 100 most influential figures in the history of advertising. She was featured in the 2009 documentary film Art & Copy.

The annual Shortland Street Cliffhanger is a storyline at the end of each year's season that leaves behind a question to be solved the following year. This technique is used to lure viewers back after the long break. Cliffhangers are usually carefully written so that storylines from throughout the year come to a head and interconnect. The following is a list by year of Shortland Street's cliffhangers. 1992 Though there was no break this year as Shortland Street screened throughout the holidays, Alison Raynor discovers she is pregnant with ex fianc√© Chris Warner's child, while Marj Neilson meets up with Jane, the daughter she gave up for adoption. 1993 Again there was no break as the show screened throughout the holidays but the hospital staff faced a difficult choice when Steve, Gina, Hone and Marj all held New Year's Eve parties - and competed for guests. They were all disappointed when Alex McKenna invited everyone to celebrate at the local bar, Kennedy's. Marj was pleasantly surprised to find lover Laurie at her door. 1994 Shortland Street took a 2-week break over the Christmas/New Year period. Jenny was shocked to discover she was pregnant. Hone Ropata had to defend himself against Ant, a dodgy (and violent) associate of his nephew, Manny. He punched him and he never got back up. Darryl Neilson persuades Stuart Neilson to interrupt Lionel and Kirsty's until-then fairytale wedding. 1995 Once again Shortland Street screened throughout the holiday period, but on Christmas Day, a truck driver drove into the hospital, knocking down Carmen Roberts and Kirsty. Kirsty was put into a coma and Carmen received a small injury to the head. Guy proposed to her and she died from a brain aneurysm moments later. Kirsty regained consciousness but suffered extreme amnesia and she told Lionel she could not remember loving him. Their marriage was over. 1996 Shortland Street took a break from the end of November 1996 until late January 1997, the longest ever break for the show. Rangi and Rachel broke up for good and wheelchair-bound Rangi found himself in a tight corner when he was trapped in the garage by a drunk Rachel - who then passed out leaving the car running. Nick discovered the truth about the garbage company he worked for and found himself in danger. In Fiji Ellen told David she was pregnant. And Lionel and Kirsty decided to give their marriage another go. The year ended on their kiss. Kirsty and Lionel after the plane crash. 1997 Shortland Street took a 6-week break from early December 1997 to mid January 1998. Jenny realised that her fugitive husband Ian Seymour was the mysterious good samaritan who had rescued her from a mugger. Donna and Rangi's romance came to a sudden halt when they discovered they were half-brother and sister. Tiffany was rushed to hospital after a potentially fatal collapse. Caroline was sentenced to life imprisonment for Annabel's \\"murder\\". And the small plane that Kirsty and Lionel were travelling in crashed. 1998 Oscar's bad deeds began to catch up with him. Fergus attacked Oscar after learning he had raped Minnie and Rachel discovered Oscar had defrauded the hospital of a million dollars. Lionel proposed to MacKenzie, unaware of her villainous activities. Oscar himself was nowhere to be found - until Minnie discovered him in Ellen and David's dining room, apparently dead. Meanwhile, Minnie's mother Ellen (who'd just learned of her daughter's rape) and Mike were looking for Minnie, hoping to find her on the harbour cruise they'd planned. The boat hit a reef and began to sink and when Mike and Ellen tried to jump to safety Ellen hit her head. Mike frantically tried to find her underwater... 1999 Moira and Dean were finally reconciled and Alesha told Frank she was pregnant - to him. Wave was shocked that her friend Minnie was using guys for their money. After a fight with lover Laura, Caroline turned to Greg for comfort. Sofia Martinez arrived, announcing she was the new Director of Shortland Street. Donna discovered Rangi wasn't her brother after all - but while trying to contact him with the good news he was pledging his devotion to policewoman girlfriend Janet, trapped under a vehicle as it went up in flames during attendance at a roadside accident. 2000 From the year 2000 onwards Shortland Street took a shorter break of 4 weeks every year. A literal cliffhanger as nasty Eamon begged for his life, but would Kate Larsen (whom Eamon had raped) pull him up? Fergus proposed to Waverley, then called off the engagement when Wave would not believe he was off drugs; Wave soon realised the error of her ways and proposed to him - but would he accept? Sofia met a stranger who introduced himself as the new head of the hospital - Chris Warner. Angela and Nick's son Lucas was born (but it was bittersweet for Nick, as he knew Angela's cancer was spreading). And Frank came under fire when he treated a murderer - and was later seen lying in the carpark in a pool of his own blood. 2001 Disappointed suitor Jack Hewitt attacked Chris and kidnapped Rachel, later staging a creepy mock wedding. Nick declared his love for Waverley and asked her to come to the UK with him. And Barb's Christmas party turned to tragedy when Marshall's garage drug lab exploded. 2002 2002 saw Waverley be diagnosed with breast cancer and Shannon announce that she was pregnant - to Tama. Rachel and Chris's relationship was on the rocks and as her alcoholism took control she moved into bartender Zac's place, and nearly drowned in his pool. Chris called it quits and decided to pursue his feelings for Donna. As they celebrated, Rachel was on her way over. Trying to talk to Chris on her mobile while driving drunk she had a serious car accident! Back at the hospital prisoner Kurt Matakuare (Victor's nemesis) had been brought in for treatment. When everyone else was at the staff Christmas party he overpowered his guard and headed for Victor's office. When Adam tried to stop him, Kurt stabbed Adam with a scalpel leaving him bleeding in the deserted corridor too weak to cry out. 2003 As 2003 drew to a close the question on everyone's lips was 'Who killed Geoff Greenlaw?' and as Geoff's sister Delphi prepared to leave Ferndale for Sydney in the company of Dominic Warner, she was horrified to uncover new evidence suggesting Dom was the murderer! Chris Warner's world crumbled around him when his girlfriend Donna discovered he'd been unfaithful, and he was arrested on trumped up charges of sexual molestation, both thanks to Dominic. The on-again, off-again romance between Toni Thompson and Logan King was all on when Logan announced he'd left his wife for Toni. At the Christmas party, Vinnie kissed Jesse and Waverley fainted for the best possible reason - she was pregnant! And across town at a charity function, Anne and Tama were trapped when the building collapsed around them. Called to the scene, ambo officer Nelson Copeland tried frantically to get Anne out before the building was completely destroyed... 2004 This year Shortland Street ran right up to Christmas and the year's final episode was a celebratory one-hour special that screened on Christmas Day. The centerpiece was Tama and Shannon's romantic beach wedding, attended by old favourites Victor, Donna and Mihi. Across town, the hospital social club was performing A Christmas Carol charity and back at the Emergency Department, Sarah and Andrew were coping with the demands of the festive season. The year ended with a combined wedding reception and A Christmas Carol wrap party at Coltrane, the romantic reunion of Barb and Sticky and the start of Sarah and Andrew's ill- fated relationship. 2005 The final episode of 2005 saw Craig, Sarah, Judy and Maia form a band to entertain their colleagues at the hospital Christmas party it was all to raise money for a good cause, and even though Sarah was dating Hamish and Craig was with Huia, their chemistry was clear as they sang the Dance Exponents hit 'Why Does Love Do This To Me?' Meanwhile, Tania Jeffries discovered that her boyfriend Mark Weston was a sex addict. During the Christmas party, Tania punched Mark and ended their relationship. 2006 Sarah finally chooses TK Samuels over old flame Craig Valentine at the staff beach party. Chris Warner begins his ill-fated affair with Justine Jones when they share a passionate kiss. 2007 Serial killer Joey Henderson attempts to murder Tania Jeffries.

Itaewon Salinsageon) is a 2009 South Korean film, based on the true story of the Itaewon murder case, which shocked Korea when Hongik college student Cho Jung-Pil was found dead at an Itaewon Burger King in 1997. The murder was investigated in 1997 by CID Agents J. Choi, D. Zeliff, T. Barnes and B. Crow. Two troubled U.S. teenagers‚ÄîArthur Patterson (the son of a former U.S. Army officer and Korean mother) and Edward Lee‚Äîbecame suspects and were convicted. Patterson was released a year later in a special amnesty and Lee was freed a year after that due to lack of evidence. The case never resulted in further convictions. It stars Jang Keun-suk as Arthur Patterson and Jung Jin-young as his lawyer. Song Joong-ki played the victim.

Edward Lee had previously testified to Patterson being the murderer during the first trial. Patterson was re-arrested by U.S. authorities in May 2011 and went before a court hearing in California concerning extradition to Korea for a new trial. Arthur Patterson's extradition to South Korea was approved and culminated with his arrival at Incheon International Airport, Sep. 2015. Murder Trial and Conviction During the four-month trial, Patterson repeatedly claimed that he was innocent and accused Lee of having killed Cho. Lee testified as a witness saying that he clearly saw Patterson turn to Cho to stab him. In January 2016, the prosecution sought a 20-year prison term for Patterson, which under Korean law is the maximum sentence able to be handed down to suspects aged 18 or less at the time of their crime.http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160129000994 On January 28, 2016, Patterson was found guilty of the stabbing of the victim, Cho Jung-Pil, and was sentenced to 20 years behind bars.

Appeals On Monday, February 1, 2016, local officials in Seoul, South Korea, informed the public that Arthur Patterson lodged an appeal with a higher court. Patterson is still adamantly denying the charges and continues to blame Lee for the stabbing death of Cho Joong-Pil.

The cemetery was created by the Alexandria Park Association, incorporated in 1914 in Huntington, West Virginia. The president of the association was Colonel Robert Dye, former superintendent of the Arlington National Cemetery, and its principal founder was Julius Broh. Another founder was Harry Randolph Thomas, great-grandfather of the current president, Daun Thomas Frankland. The Thomas family has been responsible for the cemetery since it opened in 1917. In the proposal to the Arlington County Board, the Association indicated the intent to \\"make a place that will be attractive as a park and a credit to the county.\\"Rita R. Rothwarf, \\"Neighborhood History Preservation Study for the Ashton Heights Area of Arlington County, VA\\" Arlington County Library, 1987 Grave sites at Columbia Gardens Having won approval from the County, in November 1917, the Association's board of directors employed a landscape architect from Cleveland, Ohio, a Mr. Jenney, to prepare the design, specifications, and methods of procedure for operating a cemetery. The Columbia Gardens Cemetery is an example of merging landscape design and city planning based on the principles set down in the late 19th century by designers such as Frederick Law Olmsted and subsequently developed by the City Beautiful movement. However, as opposed to the linear plans advocated by City Beautiful for urban design, Jenney preferred a more rural cemetery design, with winding roads and natural landscape features. The \\"park\\" initially encompassed nearly thirty- eight adjoining acres, with an option to purchase an additional thirty acres. The Columbia Gardens Cemetery has been family operated for four generations. At present it is one of the few cemeteries in the Northern Virginia area offering available burial sites with the option of an upright monument. Other options range from columbarium niches to family mausoleums. Upon entering the main gates on Arlington Boulevard, a main driveway passes a rose garden beyond which lie the winding alleys of the cemetery, providing a natural setting of dignity and grace for reflection on loved ones who have gone before. Originally at Arlington National Cemetery and now at the top of the main driveway of the cemetery, the mausoleum where Admiral of the Navy George Dewey, was placed upon his death until he was moved by request of his wife to a crypt at Bethlehem Chapel of the Washington National Cathedral. The mausoleum was purchased from Arlington National in 1933 and has been used as a receiving vault. = Updates = Columbia Gardens Cemetery now has a very active presence on Facebook and Instagram. While the cemetery had kept a seemingly low profile in social networking in the past, management is moving to update technology and how it interacts with the changing demographic of the Metro DC community. Many people have passed its long red brick wall for years without ever realizing the expansive property inside its borders, others have the idea the cemetery is full. Still possessing several undeveloped acres and a newly opened cremation garden, management has also found much property previously believed to be unavailable. Example of a graveside service set-up A few items that set this idyllic environment apart from other privately owned, State regulated cemeteries in the Northern Virginia area is that this is the only one that allows headstones. Another is that it hasn't clear cut its trees to make room for burial space. Many cemeteries are just fields, Columbia Gardens is working towards status as an Arboretum. Finally is the diversity of families and cultures who have made Columbia Gardens the final resting place for their loved ones. = Notable burials = * Frank Livingston Ball (October 4, 1885‚Äì April 28, 1966) Former member of the Senate of Virginia. * Margaret A.

While in Ljubljana, he taught at the Ljubljana Conservatory (Glasbena matica) and also founded the Zika Quartet (Zikovo kvarteto) in 1920 along with fellow countrymen Richard Zika (violin) and Ladislav Zika (cello), and Slovene violinist Karel Sancin.Prague Quartet Retrieved 23 January 2011. The Quartet returned to Prague in 1921 where it was called the Czechoslovak Quartet, and from 1929, the Prague Quartet. ƒåern√Ω remained as the violist of the ensemble for 46 years giving more than 1300 performances until it disbanded in the mid-1950s. ƒåern√Ω was a pioneer for the viola in the former Czechoslovakia. He enjoyed a solo career often performing the solo viola part of Berlioz's Harold en Italie and other repertoire.

It is intended to supplement, and ultimately replace traditional Internet Routing protocols. It requires the cooperation of many luminal-speed (such as radio or fiber optic) hosts to route packets in the most efficient way: a straight line. The protocol consists of mainly the same concepts as IPv4, removing the abstraction layer of the routing table and IP address with a simpler model that attempts to send packets in as close to a straight line as possible. Since this change introduces physical constraints on the geometry of the network, special techniques are implemented to overcome problems such as dead zones. History The project began as a submission to a 2008 Google contest by Ted Coffman, with the goals of democratizing the Internet and doing away with the need for ISPs, which are vulnerable to regulation by world governments. When no interest was generated, the idea was submitted to the Reddit.com Internet community. With very little feedback on Reddit, nothing was done with the concept for over two years. In January 2011 Coffman decided to move forward with development due to the recent surge in open platform smart phones that have both Wi-Fi and GPS built right in, which Coffman sees as a perfect medium for a widespread implementation of GPRP. As of January 2011, a GPRP C++ class is being developed and tested by Ted Coffman. Comparison to IPv4 To maintain backward-compatibility with the current Internet framework, IPv4 gateways are discovered using similar techniques to DNS lookups. Many of the traditional IPv4 concepts can be considered as their physical forms in GPRP: * IP Address - Now the spatial coordinates of the host (as determined by GPS). If the host is stationary, the coordinates can be programmed in, akin to a static IP address. * Subnet Mask - Now a sphere around the host, the size of which is determined by the most distant host that can be reached directly. * Default Gateway - This concept is dropped completely, replaced with case-by-case routing using hosts that are as close to a straight line toward the destination as available. * DHCP - This concept is dropped. * Other traditional IPv4 methods not mentioned do not change.

One of Adler's prominent experiments included an in depth analysis of mating performance of male rats and its relation to fertilization in the female, which led him to observe how behaviour could affect reproduction in species.Adler, N. (1975) Norman T. Adler. \\"American Psychologist\\", 30(1), 72-74. With his students and colleagues, he has worked at the interface between biology and behavior. They have stressed the importance of combining the study of physiological mechanisms controlling behavior with the functional/adaptive significance of behavior in an evolutionary context. He was influenced in this approach by his undergraduate teachers at Harvard, especially Paul Rozin, Jerry Hogan, and Gordon Bermant, and his student colleagues like Don Pfaff with whom he has maintained scientific relationships over the years. His research was also impacted by Daniel Lehrman, and he worked closely with Lehrman's student, Barry Komisaruk, on hormones and neural functioning.Komisaruk, B. R., Adler, N. T. and Hutchison, J R. (1973). Genital sensory field. Science, 181: 1295-1298 Adler is also a prominent figure in American higher education, especially the role of behavioral neuroscience in liberal arts education and religion in the college classroom. He participated in Phillip Zimbardo's PBS TV series Discovering Psychology, one of the first distance-learning courses in psychology.Adler, N. T. (1971). The alienated student and his institutions. The United Synagogue of America Review, Proceedings: 129-134 Early life and education A native of Chicago, where he attended public schools and received a Jewish education at the College of Jewish Studies.http://www.spertus.edu/aboutspertus/index.php > In high school, Adler was interested in the career of a rabbi and a psychoanalyst, but didn't know which one to choose.American Psychologist., \\"Early Career Awards for 1974\\". American Psychological Association, 1975, p. 72. He became drawn towards science after taking biology with a teacher named Richard Boyajian, who motivated him to pursue a career in biology. During his years in Harvard college, he took a course in physiological psychology, which gave him the opportunity to acknowledge that there is in fact an area of study that can combine his interests in biology and psychology. Adler graduated from Harvard in 1962 with a major in Psychology and extensive coursework in biology. After College, he spent the next year traveling around the world under the auspices of Harvard's Frederick Sheldon Traveling Fellowship. He used the year to visit the European ethologists and study animal behavior and complex social systems in general ('The City' was the title of his summary essay from that year). To become familiar with the techniques of the classical ethologists, he spent time in Africa and other field sites. He also developed an early interest in comparative religion‚Äîbut decided that the field of 'psychology of religion' was not yet ready to develop so stayed with biological psychology, which he felt was just beginning. At the latter part of his career, he has returned to the study of psychology and religion with his students and colleagues at Yeshiva University‚Äîprofoundly impressed at the speed with which a dormant field 'took off'http://www.religionnewsblog.com/18170/kashi-ashram and with how important these issues were becoming on the American campus. After the post-baccalaureate year of travel, Adler went to UC Berkeley, where he was a graduate student of Frank Beach (one of the founders of the study of hormones and behavior), and received a Master's in zoology with Howard Bern (comparative endocrinology). He then went to UCLA for a post-doctoral year with C. H. Sawyer (neuroendocrinology). He began his work on the effects of copulatory behavior on reproductive physiology. By making behavior the 'independent variable' and physiology the 'dependent variable', he felt that the adaptive significance of behavior would perforce be recognized in the biological system. Career =Academic history= He joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, where he became the youngest tenured professor at the time. He is also widely known as the founder of the Biological Basis of Behavior Program at Penn which was the prototype of the integrative study of behavior from a biological perspective. This program became a national model and helped spur the development of behavioral neuroscience in the American undergraduate curriculum. For this work, he received the Dana Award for Pioneering Achievement in Higher Education.http://www.dana.org/uploadedFiles/About_Dana/dana_foundation_timeline.pdf The University of Pennsylvania now presents an annual \\"Norman Adler Lecture in the Biological Basis of Behavior\\" in his honor. He has had a number of distinguished students in the field, including Martha McClintock at the University of Chicago, Elizabeth Adkins-Regan at Cornell University, Avery Gilbert, Jack Yanovski, Alan Rosenwasser, Stephen Zoloth at Northeastern, Penny Bernstein at Kent State University, Joseph Anisko, Rodney Pelchat, Karen Stewart, and James Toner. He served as Dean of Penn's Undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences, Dean of Yeshiva College for a decade, and was also Vice- Provost for Research and Graduate Education, and Professor of Psychology, at Northeastern University. He has also held visiting, teaching, or research appointments at University of Edinburgh, Drexel University Dept. of Engineering, and Swarthmore College. He was University Professor of Psychology at Yeshiva University and Special Assistant to the Provost for Curriculum and Research Initiatives. =Contributions to higher education= In addition to his work in behavioral neuroscience and its dissemination across American academics, he is an authority in American higher education, specializing in interdisciplinary and integrative learning. He initiated the Penn Reading Project in 1991 which has continued for over 20 years as an integrative introduction to liberal learning for college freshmen newly arriving on campus. Subsequently, Freshman Reading Projects have been adopted widely as part of the \\"first-year experience\\" at many college campuses.Penn Reading Project For this work, in 1992 Adler was inducted as an honorary member of the University of Pennsylvania's Philomathean Society‚Äîthe oldest continually existing collegiate literary society in the United States. He currently serves on the editorial board of Liberal Education, the journal of the American Association of Colleges and Universities; chairs a project for AACU‚Äôs section on ‚ÄòBig Questions: Faith and Reason on the College Campus‚Äô. In this project, citing data that there is a high level of spirituality among students in College because they continually question the \\"deeper\\" issues in their lives, the modern curriculum needs to address this. He lectures widely and is a consultant to Universities and Foundations. He has received numerous prizes and honors including two Guggenheim Fellowships, Sigma Xi National Lecture, Phi Beta Kappa, Fellowship to Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral sciences, Lindback Award for Teaching Excellence, and was in the first group of recipients for the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Awards for Early Career Contributions to Psychology.

Olguin has been called the \\"father of recreational whale watching\\", as he was the founder of the Cabrillo Whalewatch program and a founding member of the American Cetacean Society. An authorized biography, entitled \\"An Ocean of Inspiration - The John Olguin Story\\" detailing John's life is being released October 16, 2011 at the Autumn Sea Fair at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium. The book is co-authored by Dr. Stefan Harzen and Barbara J Brunnick, Ph.D. of the Taras Oceanographic Foundation and Mike Schaadt, the current Director of the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium. In 2012, a new campus of San Pedro High School, the John M. and Muriel Olguin Campus, was opened and named after Olguin and his wife. Early life Olguin was born in San Pedro, California, a port district and neighborhood of Los Angeles, on February 18, 1921. His father, Roy Olguin, had moved to southern California from Mexico in 1910 and married Josie Main, a woman from Long Beach, California, who became Olguin's mother. His ancestry also included some Chumash heritage. Olguin became a lifeguard beginning in 1937. Olguin graduated from San Pedro High School in 1941. He attempted to enlist in the U.S. Navy and United States Coast Guard at the beginning of World War II, but was rejected by both branches of the military because he wore eyeglasses. He was eventually drafted by the United States Army during World War II, serving from 1943 until 1945. Olguin was stationed throughout the Pacific theater during the war, including the Philippines, New Guinea and Japan. Olguin was a recipient of the Silver Star for his service in the Philippines. Cabrillo Marine Aquarium During the 1940s, Olguin began working with William Lloyd, a retired dentist and museum director of the newly opened Cabrillo Marine Museum. Lloyd stepped down from the position in 1949 and Olguin, who was a lifeguard captain at the time, succeeded him as director. He began enrolling in biology courses held at local universities and junior colleges to become more familiar with the exhibitions and science in the museum. Olguin established a number of educational programs, often aimed at school children, during his tenure as director. A new aquarium building, designed by Frank Gehry, was opened in 1981. Olguin remained either the director or co-director of the Cabrillo Marine Museum until his retirement in 1987. However, he remained active with the museum as its director emeritus. Additionally, Olguin persuaded fishermen from San Pedro to using their fishing boats for whale watching, which led to the creation of Cabrillo Whalewatch. He was also a founding member of the American Cetacean Society coordinated the establishment of the Point Fermin Marine Life Refuge, a California marine state park. The Cabrillo Marine Museum changed its name to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in 1993. In addition to his work with the aquarium and education, Olguin was highly active in other local San Pedro institutions and organizations. Olguin established the San Pedro Independence Day Celebration fireworks show in 1953, as well as the San Pedro Polar Bears Club. Olguin also spearheaded efforts to return the Fresnel lens to the Point Fermin Lighthouse in 2006. The San Pedro Rotary Club honored Olguin as \\"Citizen of the Millennium\\" for his work in 2009. John Olguin died at his home in San Pedro, California, on January 1, 2011, at the age of 89. he was survived by his wife of more than 50 years, artist and philanthropist Muriel Olguin; two daughters, Vi Olguin and Moni Olguin-Patten; son John Cabrillo Olguin; siblings, Leonard Olguin, Albert Olguin, Belia Olguin Smith and Esther Olguin Riggs; and four grandchildren. A public memorial service attended by more than one thousand people, was held for Olguin at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium on January 22, 2011. Olguin's widow, Muriel Olguin, received an American flag from the Veterans Advisory Commission during the ceremony. Olguin's red jacket, which he wore during whale watching tours, will now be put on exhibition at the Cabrillo Marine Museum.

The first part of the third season spent much of its time alternating between the prime and parallel universes, and \\"Entrada\\" was the first episode of the season to have time evenly divided between both. In the episode, both Olivia and her doppelganger \\"Fauxlivia\\" attempt to journey back to their respective universes. John Cassini, Seth Gabel, Ryan McDonald, Stefan Arngrim, and Karen Holness guest starred. Showrunners J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode as the \\"culmination of a lot of things that [they] had been working on for quite a while.\\" Calling it one of their favorite episodes, they believed it was a good entry point for new viewers to the series. Frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson returned to direct the episode. \\"Entrada\\" first aired on December 2, 2010 in the United States to an estimated 5.13 million viewers. It has been selected for \\"best episode\\" lists by various television critics. Both Anna Torv and John Noble submitted the episode for consideration at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, but both failed to garner a nomination. Plot At the end of the previous episode, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) was able to cross over back to her universe long enough to warn Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) she is trapped in the parallel universe. After receiving the message, Peter tests the Olivia from the other dimension, \\"Fauxlivia\\", by telling her the Greek phrase Na einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera tou (roughly, \\"May he be a better person than his father\\"), which Olivia told Peter in the \\"New Day in the Old Town\\". When Fauxlivia fails to recognize the phrase, Peter confirms his suspicions. Realizing she has been exposed, Fauxlivia forces Peter to inject himself with a paralyzing agent. She then goes to a typewriter store in the Bronx to contact the parallel universe to request an extraction. After Peter recovers, the Fringe team starts a search for Fauxlivia. Walter Bishop (John Noble) is distressed that he has no idea how to find Fauxlivia and no idea how to bring Olivia back. However, Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) discovers Fauxlivia brought Walter malasadas from a bakery in the Bronx. Peter, Walter, Farnsworth and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) search the nearby area, Peter finds the typewriter store and the team finds the typewriter used to contact the other universe (a \\"quantum entanglement\\" device). There, the team realizes that Fauxlivia is going to a train station in Newark for a 4:00 PM pick-up. Meanwhile, in the parallel universe, \\"Walternate\\" (Noble) plans on using Olivia's body in order for her alternate self to return home, as it would require a person of Olivia's mass to complete the transfer. However, Walternate arranges for Olivia's brain to be removed for further study on how to traverse universes safely. Before she is to start the operation, Olivia receives a visit from Colonel Broyles (the alternate universe's counterpart to her FBI supervisor), who is still grateful to Olivia for helping his son. Olivia convinces him that her universe is not at war with theirs; the troubles started not from any hostile action, but only as an accidental side-effect of Walter's initial crossing to save Peter. Broyles later talks with his wife and then returns to Liberty Island to save Olivia. Together, the two reach the immersion tank that Olivia used earlier, but find it empty. As a back-up plan, the two travel to Walternate's long abandoned lab at Harvard to use the sensory deprivation tank. Broyles reveals there is a GPS tracker in him, but manages to buy Olivia enough time to successfully return to her universe. As this transpires, Fauxlivia meets with a shapeshifter at the station to inject her with resonating rods. By that time, Broyles and Peter arrive at the station. To ensure her escape, Fauxlivia holds a hostage. However, Peter realizes the hostage is the shapeshifter when the hostage is unable to state the name of \\"her\\" nearby daughter. Peter shoots the shapeshifter in the head, killing it, and Fauxlivia is arrested. Later, the team learns that their own Olivia has returned. However, Fauxlivia still manages to escape back to her universe, leaving behind the mutilated body of the alternate counterpart of Broyles to make up for her mass. While Peter and Olivia reunite at a hospital, the typewriter store owner trades a piece of the doomsday device in exchange for the restoration of his paralyzed legs. Production Filmmaker Brad Anderson returned to direct the episode. \\"Entrada\\" was written by executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman. Filmmaker and frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson returned to direct the episode, shooting it in September 2010 on New Westminster's Front Street in Vancouver and in a train station. The special effects crew used a prosthetic body resembling actor Lance Reddick, minus a certain amount of mass equal to Anna Torv; they did research to find out how much a human leg typically weighs, finding the number to be around 20 percent of a body's mass. The third season spent much of its time alternating between the prime and parallel universes, and \\"Entrada\\" was the first episode of the season to have time divided between both. This was reflected in the opening credits, which were red and blue in a season that had previously differentiated each universe with one exclusive color. Pinkner and Wyman revealed in a conference call interview that the episode was the \\"culmination of a lot of things that [they] had been working on for quite a while\\". Though they loved all of their episodes, the two stated that \\"Entrada\\" was a particular favorite of theirs, with Pinker elaborating that \\"if the only episode of Fringe you ever tune into watch is this one, sure, it‚Äôs going to take you five minutes to catch up, but you will feel what‚Äôs going on, and you will understand the relationships...[It's] a great entry point\\". The producers considered making \\"Entrada\\" the mid-season finale, but instead selected \\"Marionette\\", the following week's episode. The episode featured appearances by recurring guest stars Karen Holness as Phillip Broyles' wife Diane, John Cassini as the Store Owner, and Ryan McDonald as scientist Brandon Fayette. Seth Gabel also returned to guest star as Lincoln Lee, an agent from the parallel universe. In a departure from previous Fringe trailers, Fox created and premiered a \\"grandiose movie-style\\" trailer at Entertainment Weeklys website to celebrate the airing of \\"Entrada\\". Pinkner explained that the trailer idea did not come from his production team, but rather was produced by a Fox division called Special Ops, who came up with the idea in order to platform Fringe to the audience in a way they had not seen before. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in \\"Entrada\\", with the intention of having \\"students learn about scientific intuition and how it can facilitate the scientific method of collecting data through experimentation and observation in order to formulate and test a hypothesis\\". Reception =Ratings= The original broadcast of \\"Entrada\\" occurred on December 2, 2010 in the United States. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by an estimated 5.13 million viewers, earning a 3.2/5 share among all households and a 1.8/5 share among viewers aged 18‚Äì49. This latter demographic was down five percent from the previous episode that aired on November 18. Entertainment Weekly writer Lynette Rice remarked of the low ratings, \\"If this genre series were on AMC (or featured zombies), the media world would be calling it a monster hit. Sadly, the threshold for success is far different on broadcast TV, so Fringe will always be viewed as a niche performer with a small but rabid fan base.\\" Seven days after its broadcast on time shifted viewings, \\"Entrada\\" was seen by an additional 1.7 million, pushing the total viewership up to 6.87 million with a 2.6 rating among those 18‚Äì49. =Critical reception= The episode received critical acclaim. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine wrote, \\"While it may not have been the high point that the emotional \\"Peter\\" from earlier this year was, \\"Entrada\\" was a pretty excellent action- focused episode, in which the dimensional swap between Fauxlivia and Realivia came to a head. In the process, it demonstrated that Fringe's writers have made a compelling world out of Over There in a relative few episodes‚Äîand it was another example of what a strong series Fringe has become since its committed fully to its clash-of-the-universes storyline...All in all, a satisfying hour and a good demonstration of how Fringe‚Äîone of the most improved shows of the past season or so‚Äîhas grown into one of TV's most entertaining dramas\\". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly noted that the episode \\"closed a Fringe chapter in bringing Olivia back, while opening up all sorts of fresh new possibilities for the future. Both Olivias are changed women with new amounts of information about their opposing universes, and thus will be able to influence their Walters in how to proceed henceforth. The series can resume plot threads that have been given scant attention in recent weeks, such as Walter‚Äôs takeover of Massive Dynamic, and what I‚Äôm hoping will be an increased presence by Nina Sharp, whose role in the interuniverse machinations is ripe for exploration\\". Writing for SFScope, Sarah Stegall praised Reddick's performance as both Colonel Broyles, and Torv's \\"tour-de- force\\" performance as Olivia and her doppelganger. She also noted how strong of a show Fringe has evolved into, lauding the producers' decision to focus on the show's \\"strongest and most innovative plot\\": the parallel universe. Stegall expressed hope that Fauxlivia's experiences in the prime universe would lead her to challenge Walternate's more militant actions to destroy it. Stegall further recognized the episode's editing, as \\"a complicated story like this one could have been endlessly confusing, with multiple versions of the same character, two extremely similar universes, and plot points reaching back to the first season. Yet the writing and direction kept it all sorted out, without resorting to voice-overs, flashbacks, or other lame expository devices. This is classy, tight writing, and my hat's off to the entire team\\". Television Without Pity graded the episode an A+,. Noel Murry at The A.V. Club gave it an A- highlighting Torv's performance. It topped several \\"best episode of 2010\\" lists, including Den of Geek, Give Me My Remote, and TV.com. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named \\"Entrada\\" the fifth best episode of the series, calling it \\"the sensational climax to season 3's sensational Olivia/Fauxlivia parallel universe interplay, which seemed to bring out the best in both the writers of Fringe as well as its actors, especially Anna Torv, who rocked the tricky material and created a convincingly distinct and unique doppelganger iteration of Olivia. She deserved an Emmy nomination for her work this season. Oh, well.\\" Cultural references In the parallel universe, Penn Station in Newark, New Jersey, is called \\"Springsteen Station,\\" likely indicating that prime universe native son Bruce Springsteen also exists \\"over there.\\" =Awards and nominations= Anna Torv submitted \\"Entrada\\", along with the season three episodes \\"Olivia\\", \\"Marionette\\", and \\"Bloodline\\" for consideration in the \\"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series\\" category at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards. She failed to receive a nomination. John Noble also submitted \\"Entrada\\", along with episodes \\"The Firefly\\" and \\"The Day We Died\\", for consideration in the \\"Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category\\", but did not receive a nomination.

It entails an individualized program of specific skills training and practice plus metacognitive strategies. Metacognitive strategies include helping the patient increase self-awareness regarding problem-solving skills by learning how to monitor the effectiveness of these skills and self-correct when necessary. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy (offered by a trained therapist) is a subset of Cognitive Rehabilitation (community-based rehabilitation, often in traumatic brain injury; provided by rehabilitation professionals) and has been shown to be effective for individuals who suffered a stroke in the left or right hemisphere. or brain trauma. A computer-assisted type of cognitive rehabilitation therapy called cognitive remediation therapy has been used to treat schizophrenia, ADHD, and major depressive disorder. Cognitive rehabilitation builds upon brain injury strategies involving memory, executive functions, activities planning and \\"follow through\\" (e.g., memory, task sequencing, lists). It may also be recommended for traumatic brain injury, the primary population for which it was developed in the university medical and rehabilitation communities,Kreutzer, J. & Wehman, P. (1991).

Brookes. such as that suffered by U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, according to Dr. Gregory J. O'Shanick of the Brain Injury Association of America. Her new doctor has confirmed that it will be part of her rehabilitation.

Assessments According to the standard text by Sohlberg and Mateer: > Individuals and families respond differently to different interventions, in > different ways, at different times after injury. Premorbid functioning, > personality, social support, and environmental demands are but a few of the > factors that can profoundly influence outcome. In this variable response to > treatment, cognitive rehabilitation is no different from treatment for > cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, > psychiatric disorders, or any other injury or disease process for which > variable response to different treatments is the norm. Nevertheless, many different statistical analyses of the benefits of this therapy have been carried out. One study made in 2002 analyzed 47 treatment comparisons and reported \\"a differential benefit in favor of cognitive rehabilitation in 37 of 47 (78.7%) comparisons, with no comparison demonstrating a benefit in favor of the alternative treatment condition.\\" An internal study conducted by the Tricare Management Agency in 2009 is cited by the US Department of Defense as its reason for refusing to pay for this therapy for veterans who have suffered traumatic brain injury. According to Tricare, \\"There is insufficient, evidence-based research available to conclude that cognitive rehabilitation therapy is beneficial in treating traumatic brain injury.\\" The ECRI Institute, whose report serves as the basis for this decision by the Department of Defense, has summed up their own findings this way: > In our report, we carried out several meta-analyses using data from 18 > randomized controlled trials. Based on data from these studies, we were able > to conclude the following: * Adults with moderate to severe traumatic brain > injury who receive social skills training perform significantly better on > measures of social communication than patients who receive no treatment. * > Adults with traumatic brain injury who receive comprehensive cognitive > rehabilitation therapy report significant improvement on measures of quality > of life compared to patients who receive a less intense form of therapy. The > strength of the evidence supporting our conclusions was low due to the small > number of studies that addressed the outcomes of interest. Further, the > evidence was too weak to draw any definitive conclusions about the > effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy for treating deficits > related to the following cognitive areas: attention, memory, visuospacial > skills, and executive function. The following factors contributed to the > weakness of the evidence: differences in the outcomes assessed in the > studies, differences in the types of cognitive rehabilitation therapy > methods/strategies employed across studies, differences in the control > conditions, and/or insufficient number of studies addressing an outcome. Citing this 2009 assessment, US Department of Defense, one of the federal agencies not responsible for health care decisions in the US, has declared that cognitive rehabilitation therapy is scientifically unproved and should refer their concerns to the US Department of Health and Human Services, US Budget and Management, and/or the Government Accountability Office (GAO). As a result, it refuses to cover the cost of cognitive rehabilitation for brain- injured veterans.Letter to The Honorable Robert Gates from Senator Claire McCaskill (January 19, 2011) Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness studies, together with an analysis of personnel and veterans' services for new our emerging groups in head and brain injuries, are recommended.

It was located on a now-demolished portion of the Imbiah Lookout entertainment zone on the island. The Musical Fountain was officially opened on 11 June 1982, and ceased operations 25 years later on 26 March 2007, and was demolished that same year. The venue arena could accommodate more than 5000 people. It hosted five different shows through the 25 years it had been in operation, including the famous Magical Sentosa show which ran during the last 5 years of the fountain's operations. History =Origins= In the late 1960s, the Singapore government decided to develop of a plot of land on the then-named Pulau Blakang Mati (currently known as Sentosa Island) for entertainment purposes. After the Sentosa Development Corporation was incorporated, one of their major plans for the island was to build a musical fountain feature. The fountain would be located at the Northwest of the island, which would be known as Imbiah Bay, (later called Imbiah Lookout). =Construction= The side view of the 'Musical Fountain'. The spotlights, used for the shows throughout the 1980s till the 1990s, were draped in green cloth by Laservision Construction began in 1972. A contract was signed between Mr. Tham Tuck Yen‚Äîthen director of the Sentosa Development Corporation, and Mr Norman Wee‚Äîthen director of Venus Enterprises and a building contractor. The Sentosa Musical Fountain required a decade to build, at a cost of SG$ (Singapore dollar) 3.2 million. In 1982, the fountain was officially opened as part of Sentosa Island's grand opening. =Preview and Official opening= On 30 April 1982, Singapore news publication, The Straits Times reported that the fountain will open briefly for an official preview on May Day. The half an hour event was graced by 500 guest which included the two guests of honour, then Home Affairs minister, Chua Sian Chin and the now- retired Minister in Prime Minister's Office, Lee Khoon Choy. It was only at 7:30 pm (SST) on 11 June 1982, that the Musical Fountain was officially opened to the general public. The fountain was declared open by then Sentosa Leisure Group chairman, Mr Tan I. Tong. At the point of its opening, the outdoor fountain was the largest of its kind in Asia. =Renovations= In the late 1980s, the concrete wall that stood behind the fountain was rebuilt into a man-made cliff and waterfall, then in 1992, the co-operation decided that extra features like the then-newly introduced 1982 Sentosa logo; drawn onto a large wooden plank, ponds, a symphony stage, and renewed water jets would be added. Plans were drawn for the water jets to shoot up over high, but due to high cost estimates their height was only raised up to . The colonnades at the top of the fountain also had its design changed. In 1996, the gigantic tall Merlion Statue was added above the Musical Fountain as a new attraction on Sentosa. Afterwards, the idea was developed to install LED Laser beams in the Merlion's eyes, with the intention that laser would be part of the musical fountain's show. Laservision was commissioned to make a major upgrade to the fountains and install laser lighting.Laservision projects on Spirits of Sentosa. The laser light beams are strong enough to be seen from away. After this upgrade, visitors had no access into the Merlion Statue tower after 7 pm ‚Äì due to laser radiation blinding and other safety issues. Also, the 1982 Sentosa logo was then taken down and replaced with a different logo, but still bearing the same name. (The 1982 logo would reappear again for a brief period until ECA2 was commissioned to restore the fountain where it was once again taken down.) =1999 restoration= In 1999, the fountain underwent a major two-year restoration project directed by Fischer Media Group under the supervision of ECA2.Infovision Profile During the restoration, the wooden plank with the old Sentosa logo from 1982 was replaced by a plaster sculpture for two reasons. Firstly, due to termite infestation and secondly as a prop for the Magical Sentosa show after it was commissioned in September 2002. The fountain's exterior design and the colonnades design was re-designed to the more attractive Neoclassical design. In addition, the seats in the fountain's gallery were repainted to resemble the seven colours of a rainbow. The previously installed laser fixtures were draped in green fabric by Laservision Australia. =Events= United States Navy Seventh Fleet Band performing for visitors on the Fountain's platform. The Sentosa Musical Fountain was the venue for many events, special performances, and variety shows ‚Äì from its opening in 1982 until its closure in March 2007. It was one of the hosting venues for the 2005 Singapore Youth Festival. The Musical Fountain was the venue for a gala dinner held in conjunction with the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization in 1996. In 1993 the flame of the 1993 Southeast Asian Games was lit at the symphony stage of the fountain by then Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong. In 2002, the then unheard of, Media Development Authority was announced at the fountain by David Lim, the then acting minister for the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts. Shows Through the Musical Fountain's years as an entertainment venue, five different shows were staged there. Each one required up to five months to fully design, choreograph, and install. =Fountain Display Show= Running Period: 1982 ‚Äì 1991 (later re-continued in the late 1990s in the day [4pm to 5pm] until the fountain's closure and for a brief period in the evening until Magical Sentosa was incorporated.) Production company: Self choreographed The first programmed show at the Musical Fountain was the \\"Fountain Display Show\\" and it‚Äôs programmed by Waltzing Waters, running through the 1980s and early 1990s. It was inspired by the synchronised water dance of the Fountains of Bellagio on the Las Vegas Strip. Usually the show used computer choreographed Broadway show tunes and other famous songs.10 June 1982, Page 7 The Straits Times (Musical fount opens‚Äî1982)\\"Fountain Display Show\\": A rare archived 3 minutes and 36 seconds of the original show footage on YouTube @ The show ran thrice nightly with an additional show during Sundays and Public Holidays. In the late 1990s, the show was repeated during the day from 4 pm to 5 pm but without the colourful lights, and the only evidence left is two videos that can be found on YouTube and a few dozen photographs scattered all over the Internet. Between 2000 and 2002, the show was repeated in the evening until Magical Sentosa permanently replaced the show. =Rise of the Merlion= Running Period: 1993 ‚Äì 1996 Production company: Disputed but sponsorship later taken over by Laservision Mega Media Pty Ltd \\"Rise of the Merlion\\" is considered the first show to use laser animation and graphics at the 'Musical Fountain'. The show gave a 'revisionist' History of Singapore that included the outcome of the Merlion (country mascot). In 1994 the show's lighting was improved by Laservision Mega Media Pty Ltd, before the show was shut down a year later. =Spirits of Sentosa and Going Around the World= Running period: 1997 ‚Äì 2002 Production company: Laservision Mega Media Pty Ltd (Spirits of Sentosa); Disputed (Going around the World) \\"Spirits of Sentosa\\" show in 1999, with the Merlion in the background. In 1997 came two shows, the first was \\"Spirits of Sentosa\\", developed by Laservision Mega Media Pty Ltd. The second is Going Around the World, which has disputed origins. Spirits of Sentosa is the first show staged on the fountain, to use graphical imagery. It was developed by Laservision designers, Simon McCartney, Lloyd Weir and Richard Tan.Laser Display Awards nominees According to the only known video taken during the show's run, the show starts with an old wizard speaking to the audience about the wonders of Sentosa, which is also inhabited by spirits. The three Spirits of Sentosa is then shown one at a time, and it is revealed that their mystical powers are bound in a magical pearl. Unfortunately, the pearl is stolen by an evil 2D/CGI dragon, who wants it for its own selfish needs. Upon realising that their magical pearl was stolen, the three spirits battle with the dragon to regain the pearl, with the evil dragon being defeated in the end. The pearl is returned to its rightful place and the fountains dance in celebration. The show ends with a final monologue from the same old wizard, and the show closes with a final dance from the fountains. It is noticeable too in the video that before the actual Spirits of Sentosa show starts, there is footage showing laser images projecting iconic world landmarks. This suggest that Going Around the World could have been played first before Spirits of Sentosa is actually being performed. In a behind-the-scenes video, the cast members who performed as the three \\"Spirits of Sentosa\\" were filmed while posed in a bathtub while on set in Laservision's Sydney studio.This video shows Laservision Mega Media Pty Ltd going behind-the-scenes of Spirits of Sentosa. ‚Äì Sentosa Island Singapore = Magical Sentosa = Running period: 2002 ‚Äì 2007 Production company: ECA2 \\"Magical Sentosa\\" was the fifth and final show staged on the fountain and arguably the most recognisable. The show was created in 2000, when Yves P√©pin (designer of the Songs of the Sea show and its upcoming replacement show Wings of Time) designed a show to fit the Imbiah Lookout zone's theme of fantasy. After using ideas from an earlier production in France and restoring the fountain again which took about two years, engineers installed new equipment to create an all-new nighttime show that placed Kiki the Hyperactive Monkey of Sentosa, the official mascot of Sentosa Island at that time, as the host. It was also the first time that the audience saw him in CGI‚ÄîComputer Generated Imagery.ECA2: Magical Sentosa HD Trailer See also: Magical Sentosa (soundtrack) Demolition The main entrance of the current Resorts World Sentosa. The fountain seen in the background of this image, marks the site of the former \\"cascading waterfall\\" feature. The glass roof of the atrium of Hotel Michael would have been the \\"cliff\\" of the \\"waterfall\\". After operating for 25 years, the Musical Fountain staged its last Magical Sentosa show on 25 March 2007. It was then shut down and demolished to make way for a new integrated resort named Resorts World Sentosa, which now occupies the site and beyond. The area where the fountain once stood is the present site of: the 'Lake of Dreams'; Hotel Micheal; and Crockford Tower. Part of the Musical Fountain's old foundation was used in construction of the 'Lake of Dreams' landscape feature. A new lower and much smaller fountain marks the site of the former tall waterfall and cliff, which is now used as the main entrance to Resorts World Sentosa. The Sentosa Musical Fountain was eventually replaced by another computer programmed large musical fountain named Songs of the Sea, situated along Siloso Beach. =Songs of the Sea= After demolition works began on the old musical fountain on 26 March 2007, the development plans for Sentosa included a new musical fountain entertainment venue, to be named Songs of the Sea. The new musical fountain is sited at Siloso Beach, near Sentosa Express's Beach Station. Construction work on Songs of the Sea began in January 2006, and was completed in February 2007. The show made its debut on 26 March 2007. Between 26 March 2007 and 31 December 2007, the \\"Songs of the Sea\\" program had been watched by 992,000 visitors.Songs of the Sea ‚Äî Part 1 on YoutubeSongs of the Sea ‚Äî Part 2 on YoutubeSongs of the Sea ‚Äî Part 3 on Youtube Architecture and engineering The main gates of the Musical Fountain at the Fountain Gardens promenade. During its final renovation, the Musical Fountain's redesign was based two opposite themes. The first theme which is widely seen in the fountain's design, was the formal Neoclassical architecture. But despite this, both Classical Revival and Postmodern versions; especially the substantially decorated colonnades are seen. The other theme was from informal 'nature's wonderland' imagery; using a small pond, flowering trees and ornamental plants, and a constructed large naturalistic waterfall, which was formerly a concrete wall. The fountain's symphony stage is better recognised for the location of the \\"SENTOSA\\" plaster sculpture, which is the centerpiece of the fountain. The sculpture sits in place of the earlier wooden plank with the 1982 Sentosa logo drawn on it. The Musical Fountain's main swan shaped pool was deep and contained 31, 700 gallons of water, which took a total of 3 hours to completely fill. The pool length itself is wide. The largest water jets of the fountain were able to shoot water up to a height of . The fountain could also produce more than 19 different water formations (16 originally), including the famous form of a Phoenix flanked by waltzing chorus-lines. Other patterns of the main fountain included at least six rotating basket-weave fountains, three-tiered water formations at the sides of the main pool, and eight pairs of swaying fountain jets. Numerous fireball shooters and water geysers lined the front of the pool in front of the fountain nozzles. Additionally, the fountain had two terrace pools flanking it. These contained two rings of water jets shooting inward, a central nozzle shooting water higher than 15 metres, a single rotating basket weave fountain, and arcing jets that shot water towards the main pool. Also, the Musical Fountain had three large water projection screens, one on the main fountain, and another two on the terrace pools. It is believed that the \\"O\\" in the \\"SENTOSA\\" plaster sculpture sign led to a dressing room concealed inside a narrow trench tucked in between the pond and main pool. Cast members of a show entered and exited through this opening. The \\"O\\" was also used during the performances of the 'Magical Sentosa' show. A projection room can also be clearly seen during the day, hidden on the left side of the cascading waterfall feature. The frontal part of the room is shrouded by greenery from the area, with some green scaffolding partially camouflaging it. Thus, rendering the only object in the room, the projector, visible from the seating gallery and platform. This may suggest that video and images are not projected from the front of the fountain but the back instead, to give it a clearer field of depth. The control room though is not located at that area, it is located at the front of the seating gallery. It is here that laser images and lighting are controlled and activated. Web documentation The history of the Musical Fountain, including rare audio recordings and videos, are posted throughout the internet. These show the fountains's key events and evolving development.

They are the 22nd and 23rd episodes of the season, and the 42nd and 43rd episodes of the series overall. Both parts were written by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, together with showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman. Goldsman also served as director, his first such credit since the season premiere. Fringes premise is based on the idea of two parallel universes, our own and the Other Side, each of which contains historical idiosyncrasies. The two universes began to clash in 1985, after Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) stole the parallel universe version of his son, Peter, following his own son's death. The finale's narrative recounts what happens when Peter (Joshua Jackson) is taken back to the Other Side by his real father, dubbed \\"Walternate\\" (Noble). FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and Walter lead a team of former Cortexiphan test subjects to retrieve him, after discovering that Peter is an unwitting part of Walternate's plans to bring about the destruction of our universe using an ancient doomsday device. In the finale, the main characters spend the longest amount of time in the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize the differences between the two worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelg√§nger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture differences were noted and appreciated by critics, persuading the writers to add more in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively. Although originally intended to air on the same night, the two parts were broadcast in the United States a week apart. On its initial airing on May 13, 2010, an estimated 5.99 million viewers watched part one. Part two aired on May 20, and was viewed by an estimated audience of 5.68 million. Both episodes received overwhelmingly positive reviews, and the season was chosen for a significant number of \\"best of\\" lists by various media outlets; many critics praised the second episode's cliffhanger in particular. The finale was included in most of the categories at Entertainment Weeklys voter-driven TV Season Finale Awards, placing first in two. Pinkner, Wyman, and Goldsman submitted both episodes for the drama writing and directing categories for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, and Nimoy submitted his work from the second episode for consideration in the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series category; none received a nomination. Plot =Part one= Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) discover that Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) has agreed to return with his real father, dubbed \\"Walternate\\" (Noble), to his own universe called the Other Side, which runs parallel to ours. One of the mysterious Observers (Michael Cerveris) leaves Olivia a note indicating that Peter is named in a prophecy as the one responsible for the end of the world. To warn Peter of his impending role, the Fringe Division work with biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic to come up with a way to cross over. They form a plan that takes advantage of Olivia's universe-hopping ability, and recruit three other Cortexiphan test subjects who have unique abilities: Nick Lane (David Call), Sally Clark (Pascale Hutton), and James Heath (Omar Metwally), two of whom appeared in previous episodes. The team‚Äîcomposed of Walter, Olivia, Nick, Sally, and James‚Äîsuccessfully arrives on the Other Side. James dies shortly after arrival, but the rest manage to escape the alternate reality's Fringe Division, who had used their special technology to detect their arrival. It is revealed that Walternate is the Secretary of Defense on the Other Side. Peter reunites with his real mother, Elizabeth (Orla Brady), while Walter's team journeys to meet with William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) at Central Park. But instead of Bell the alternate Fringe Division appears, and attacks Walter's team. Nick is shot and Sally stays with him; she produces a suicidal fireball that torches both her and Nick to ashes and severely burns the Other Side Fringe Division's principal investigator Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel). Walter is shot and walks to the hospital. Olivia follows her alternate counterpart and encounters Bell, who insists he did not betray their location to the Fringe Division and tells her that Walter is in trouble. Walternate is seen in the room housing the doomsday device Peter will be a part of, and leaves with its final component. =Part two= Walternate learns of Walter's presence in the hospital and dispatches \\"Fauxlivia\\" (Torv) and \\"Alt-Charlie\\" (Kirk Acevedo) to apprehend him, but before their arrival Bell and Olivia liberate Walter and escape. Fauxlivia sees a surveillance shot of Olivia and Walter and decides to confer with Walternate about the doppelg√§ngers. During a discussion in his office, Walternate lies to Peter about the doomsday machine's real purpose, claiming it can help to heal both worlds. Fauxlivia meets Peter in Walternate's office and subsequently drives him to his new apartment. Walter and Bell travel to Harvard to collect some equipment necessary for the journey back to their own universe, and Walter reveals his intense dislike for Bell, whom he considers to have been a selfish war profiteer while he himself was locked away for seventeen years. Bell tells Walter that the parallel universe equivalent of himself died in a car accident as a young man. Olivia confronts Fauxlivia, who recognizes that Olivia has feelings for Peter. The women fight, and after rendering Fauxlivia unconscious Olivia dyes her hair to assume Fauxlivia's identity. Meanwhile, Peter discovers that the machine is symbiotic and needs a particular human to control it‚Äîhim. Olivia and an oblivious alt-Charlie visit Peter to take him to a safe location. Olivia knocks out alt-Charlie and reveals herself to Peter, informing him of the machine's real purpose and Walternate's intentions. Peter tells her that he does not belong in either reality, following which Olivia admits her romantic feelings for him and convinces him to leave with her. The couple race to meet Walter and Bell at the Opera House, where Fauxlivia and a team of Fringe Commandos catch up with them. Bell and Olivia hold off the assault while Peter and Walter set up the dimensional device to enable their return home. Lacking a fuel source for the device, Bell sacrifices himself to create a nuclear reaction, using his body's unstable molecular state. Close to death, Bell reveals that he removed Walter's memories at his own request, and he and Walter are reconciled. Olivia, Walter, and Peter return home. Peter tells Walter he will never understand him, but because Walter traveled to another universe twice to save him‚Äîwhich has \\"gotta count for something\\"‚Äîhe forgives him. Olivia is revealed to be Fauxlivia, infiltrating Our Side, when she arrives at a typewriter communication station to await orders. The Olivia from our world is then seen in a military detention center on the Other Side. Walternate visits and stares at Olivia without speaking before leaving her in the dark, in solitary confinement. Production =Writing and filming= \\"Over There\\" was written by Academy Award-winning screenwriter and frequent Fringe collaborator Akiva Goldsman, together with showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman. Goldsman directed the episodes, his first such credit since the season premiere. He explained the finale in a January 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly: \\"We're trying to do the last two episodes as a singular event, a little bit more movie-like. It's really one big story. We're approaching it like a mini-feature. It'll have a singular narrative drive.\\" They originally intended for the two parts to air on the same night, but Fox told them it would be shown on two nights, a week apart. The episodes first aired in the United States on May 13 and May 20, 2010. The writers, finding the script to be easily divisible, ended the first episode with William Bell and Olivia meeting outside Fauxlivia's apartment, and began the second with Bell helping Walter escape from the hospital.Pinkner et al, 4:52‚Äì5:07 Pinkner and Wyman brought back the \\"Cortexiphan kids\\", introduced in the first two seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted the end of the season to be a \\"beautiful culmination of everything\\" while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but \\"Over There\\" marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: \\"One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line.\\" Wyman said that the parallel universe \\"is a reminder to our viewers that your life is what your choices are.\\" The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that \\"a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible.\\" Pinkner later elaborated, \\"We're interested in world building and all that stuff is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real.\\" They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics.Pinkner et al, 13:59‚Äì14:58 He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side.Pinkner et al, 15:59‚Äì16:02 Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season. The finale introduces parallel-universe versions of familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress Anna Torv. One topic of conversation among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using \\"Fauxlivia\\", \\"Bolivia\\", and/or \\"Altlivia\\".Pinkner et al, 2:35‚Äì2:40 The writers chose Fauxlivia because a character in a season three episode referred to her as such. Torv and Akiva Goldsman discussed various ways to differentiate the two depictions of Olivia; ultimately two different physical demeanors were created. Torv wanted to make the new character \\"completely different\\", but she and Goldsman recognized that the two share some major similarities, as they both are in the same profession and are \\"fundamentally, genetically really the same person.\\" According to Torv, Fauxlivia holds herself differently and has \\"a different silhouette. She's got a little firefighter, a little military in her.\\" Torv further explained, \\"Olivia wants to be the best, but [Fauxlivia] just wants to win;\\" \\"There's just a front-footedness I think to [her], simply because she just doesn't carry the weight of the world on her shoulders like Olivia does. Olivia's mum died when she was really little, and [Fauxlivia]'s mum is still around. There's lots of little, subtle differences.\\" The producers discussed cutting her hair, but ultimately decided on the auburn hair color to differentiate her. They also made her \\"a little bit more playful\\".Pinkner et al, 3:05‚Äì3:24 Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD audio commentary: \\"When [Torv] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a very playful and sexy way. She turned a lot of heads.\\"Pinkner et al, 3:25‚Äì3:40 Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia.Pinkner et al, 10:39‚Äì11:21 The producers were so pleased with her Fauxlivia depiction that they thought \\"it really opened up a bunch of possibilities ... it went from 'let's see if this experiment works' to 'how can we get more of this?Pinkner et al, 11:22‚Äì11:28 \\"Over There\\" marks the first time Olivia meets Fauxlivia. Their meeting was one of the first scenes to be shot; this caused Anna Torv to be anxious about her new character's traits \\"coming across\\", as she had not yet developed all her mannerisms for Fauxlivia. While filming the conversation between the two, they did not use a double; Torv memorized the timing and where she should be looking and pointing her gun, and the characters were filmed one at a time.Pinkner et al, 20:18‚Äì22:13 Torv commented about the scene, \\"You're talking to air. Learning both sides ... was tough.\\" For the fight scene that followed, Torv had to block and aim her gun carefully while being mindful of her movements and the camera's location‚Äîthough she was aided by stunt doubles. Torv credits the crew for successfully completing the scene: \\"I give them all the credit in the world. It took a while. They had to change the makeup, change the clothes, change the hair, change every little thing, every time they [moved] the camera.\\" A later scene depicts Walter in a hospital recovering from a gunshot wound. Olivia and William Bell try to smuggle him out. As it was a real emergency room in a Vancouver hospital, the crew had only one day of shooting.Pinkner et al, 3:58‚Äì4:10 One of the scenes included \\"monitor acting\\", in which Torv had to react to a blank computer screen, because the writers had not yet chosen what images they wanted to display.Pinkner et al, 7:03‚Äì7:24 The scene between Olivia, Walter, and Bell was originally set in a coffee shop, but the producers changed their minds when they realized they needed more funding for the finale. Consequently, they began \\"hawking\\" the scene in the hopes of gaining a sponsor. KFC responded, agreeing to pay them for shooting the scene at one of their locations.Pinkner et al, 11:50‚Äì12:43 Walternate's office scenes were shot in a mortuary overlooking a cemetery.Pinkner et al, 8:14‚Äì8:20 Goldsman had Joshua Jackson react in different ways during his first meeting with Fauxlivia, including showing \\"anger and testiness\\". He ultimately decided he would be \\"quite taken with her\\".Pinkner et al, 9:48‚Äì10:22 For the second episode's cliffhanger, the producers worried about making it as \\"provocative\\" as the first season's.Pinkner et al, 38:52‚Äì39:24 They were originally going to have Olivia sacrifice herself to allow Peter and Walter's return to Our Side, but changed their minds when Wyman suggested she be secretly swapped with Fauxlivia instead.Torv et al, 25:00‚Äì25:45Pinkner et al, 36:17‚Äì36:51, 42:37‚Äì43:25 Wyman commented, \\"We were ecstatic when we figured [the cliffhanger] out.\\" Co-creator J.J. Abrams and other cast members were also pleased with it, with Abrams calling it \\"different, but I think equally impactful.\\" They wrote the cliffhanger before they knew whether the series had been renewed‚Äîthey would have had to make an \\"eleventh-hour redraft\\" had the show been canceled by Fox. =Casting= On April 5, 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported that Dirty Sexy Money actor Seth Gabel had been cast as the lead Fringe investigator in the parallel universe, and would be making his first appearance in the finale as a possible recurring character. Jeff Pinkner described the character as \\"the scientist-cop-leader of the team on the Other Side.\\" In an interview with TV Guide, Gabel commented that during shooting he felt that he looked \\"like such a doofus holding a gun,\\" but changed his mind when he saw the finished production. Gabel elaborated, \\"I was so scared that I wouldn't pull it off. Once I saw myself being a scientist-slash-FBI hero, I felt more confident and relaxed.\\" His character is caught in a large explosion in the finale, but Gabel confirmed, in a Chicago Tribune interview, that his character would be returning for the third season. He states that the parallel universe has \\"special technology than can heal burns\\". The finale marked the return of actor Kirk Acevedo as the Other Side FBI agent Charlie Francis. In the DVD audio commentary, the producers admit they \\"faced a bit of hatred\\" when they killed off Acevedo's character near the beginning of the season. They were aware the entire time that Charlie exists in the parallel universe, and that \\"nobody ever dies on Fringe.Pinkner et al, 6:15‚Äì6:33 Acevedo describes the parallel universe version of his character as someone who is \\"so much more fun.\\" He is subtly different, with a lighter personality; he jokes around more, and is less \\"doom and gloom\\" than the original character. Some viewers refer to the new character as \\"alt-Charlie\\" to differentiate the two. The actor, the producers, and some fans have called the new character \\"Scarlie\\" in reference to a scar on his cheek, which takes ten minutes to apply before shooting, according to Acevedo. Previous guest actors Orla Brady, Lily Pilblad, Ari Graynor, Omar Metwally, Ryan McDonald, and David Call appear in the finale, as well as new guest stars Philip Winchester and Pascale Hutton. Some cast members portray alternate versions of their characters, including John Noble, Lance Reddick, and Jasika Nicole. Noble described his doppelg√§nger‚Äînicknamed \\"Walternate\\" by Walter‚Äîas \\"[physically] the same man and the same actor.\\" He continued, \\"I think of [Walternate] as a soldier. He's like a general in the army. He's very upright, he's very strong.\\" Reddick called alt-Broyles \\"a great patriot and a great mind,\\" but \\"a bit of a maverick, so I guess we'll see just how that loyalty and relationship plays out.\\" Nicole based \\"alterna-Astrid\\"s characteristics on her sister, who has Asperger syndrome, partly by avoiding eye contact with the other characters when relaying information to them and by focusing solely on the data in front of her. Though guest actor Leonard Nimoy was reluctant to return after completing his three-episode commitment on the show that had ended with the season's tenth episode, he returned for the season finale when the producers \\"essentially called him up and pleaded\\". They discussed their plans for the character, and \\"told him it was a story we couldn't tell without him.\\" He \\"graciously agreed.\\"Pinkner et al, 17:49‚Äì18:26 \\"Over There\\" marked Nimoy's longest appearance on Fringe,Pinkner et al, 5:04‚Äì5:06 a longer and \\"much more involv[ed]\\" shoot of roughly seven days was required. Despite Leonard Nimoy's planned exit from the show, the show's producers have said that nothing is final in the Fringe world. Pinkner commented that Nimoy's retirement from acting obviously hinders his character's possible return but, \\"if Leonard chooses to come back, there is a story in place that we'd love to tell.\\" Wyman elaborated that \\"I think it's fair to say that you have not experienced the last of William Bell\\". When the producers told Nimoy their ideas for Bell's storyline in the third season, he returned for some brief voice and animation work in the episode \\"Lysergic Acid Diethylamide\\". Cultural references A number of popular culture references are used to subtly differentiate the two universes. The American drama series The West Wing is beginning its 11th season in the parallel universe, and US politicians Barack Obama and Sarah Palin are in one of the show's advertisements. The parallel universe's Statue of Liberty is still its original shiny copper. \\"We imagined that Over There, they really liked copper and they cleaned it all the time,\\" one of the creators says. Liberty Island is the location of Fringe Division and the Department of Defense on the Other Side. The Hotel Attraction project by Spanish architect Antoni Gaud√≠ was built in 1908 in the parallel universe, whereas in our world it never went past initial planning. Former president Richard Nixon is shown on a dollar coin in the parallel universe, rather than Dwight Eisenhower. Fauxlivia finds a twenty-dollar bill from Our Side and questions who Andrew Jackson is, implying that he was either never president or is far less known in their universe. Civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. is shown on their version of the bill, which has been nicknamed a \\"junior\\". Aviator Charles Lindbergh is less well known in the parallel universe, and the famous kidnapping of his son presumably did not occur, as Fauxlivia expresses confusion when his name is brought up. When Walter, Bell, and Olivia are on the Other Side eating at KFC (called KGC in the alternate universe, for Kentucky Grilled Chicken), Walter puts on a Brooklyn Dodgers baseball cap. Unlike in Our Side, the team never moved to Los Angeles. The parallel universe has a number of famous comic book issues from DC Comics, similar to Our Side, but with notable differences. For instance, the Red Arrow and Red Lantern exist on the Other Side, rather than the green versions of both characters in our universe, and there are different members in the Justice League. Fauxlivia's cellphone ringtone is taken from the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Other films, both real and invented, are also shown in the parallel universe, such as Superman vs. Batman 2, Indiana Jones and the Hex of the Hydra, Star Wars: Legion of Droids, Splash 7, Smokey and the Bandit: The Final Lap and Mask vs. Joker. Reception =Broadcast and ratings= Fox renewed Fringe for a third season in early March 2010. The episodes aired on May 13 and May 20, 2010, in the United States and Canada. On May 17 Fox announced that the show would remain in its Thursday timeslot for the new season. A deleted scene cut from the finale featured Walternate and Peter discussing the fictional band \\"Violet Sedan Chair\\" while driving a Ford Taurus; the scene's reference to a \\"Ford exclusive\\", as well as the perceived \\"loving shots\\" of the car, caused it to be noted as a prime example of product placement by some critics. The scene was advertised during the second episode's commercial breaks in the US, advising viewers to view the clip at Fox's official website. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released two science lesson plans for grade school children focusing on the science seen in both parts of \\"Over There\\"; the first part's intention was to have \\"students learn about how the various forms of energy can be converted into other forms of energy and how these conversions can be used to either disperse or concentrate energy.\\" The second part's purpose was for \\"students [to] learn about how various types of sensors can be used to remotely collect information about a geographical area, which allows for unique scientific analyses and discoveries.\\" According to the Nielsen ratings system, upon its original US broadcast, part one garnered an estimated 5.99 million viewers and a 3.6/6 ratings share among all households. It received a 2.3/7 ratings share among adults 18‚Äì49. In keeping with the rest of its second season, Fringes ratings suffered due to tough competition from episodes of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and ABC's Grey's Anatomy, as these programs were also broadcast in the same time slot. Fringe and its lead-in, Bones, helped Fox place third for the night, behind CBS and ABC. The second part was viewed by an estimated 5.68 million viewers, with a 2.0 ratings share among adults 18‚Äì49. This was a 13 percent fall in the 18‚Äì49 ratings share from the previous week, as the second episode faced competition from the season finale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and the two-part season finale of Grey's Anatomy. \\"Over There's\\" second part helped Fox place third for total viewers that night, behind CBS and ABC, and tie with NBC for third place among viewers 18‚Äì49. The finale aired on two separate nights in the United Kingdom. The first part was scheduled to air on May 25, 2010, on the UK's Sky1, but was put back a week to make room for the series finale of Lost. The first part aired on June 1 in the UK, with an estimated 195,000 viewers tuning in. The second part aired on June 8 to an estimated 246,000 viewers. =Reviews= The first part of the finale received critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN thought it \\"fantastic,\\" because it was \\"a great story that leads us into one hell of a conclusion to the season,\\" and that it \\"right away [gave] us the deepest, most exciting look into the alternate universe we've seen so far.\\" He rated it 9.0/10. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly and MTV's Josh Wigler agreed on this last point, with Tucker noting the first part \\"was a complete success and a blast at giving us a fully lived-in alternate universe.\\" Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded the first part with an A‚àí, calling it \\"a fun, exciting episode that nicely set up next week's finale\\". Isler, Wigler, and Murray loved the return of the Cortexifan subjects; Murray docked the episode a half point, explaining \\"I love the idea of Olivia & The Cortexifanatics so much that I'm bummed Fringe burned through the group so quickly.\\" Critic Andrew Hanson, writing for the Los Angeles Times, noted that because of the parallel universe focus, the first part felt like the following season's premiere. He praised the opening scene, and believed the scenes between Peter and his mother helped \\"ground the episode. They might be out of pace with the action and drama pouring out of every other moment, but there was weight and emotion. Bravo Joshua Jackson and Orla Brady. Bravo.\\" Ken Tucker noted that the scenes with Peter and his true mother indicated \\"a great, humantistic use of a sci-fi trope\\". MTV's Josh Wigler praised Torv's performance, but wished the two-part finale was not broken up, explaining \\"I could have easily tuned in for another several hours. Heck, I could watch an entire parallel series focused solely on the alternate universe!\\" Like part one, the second part premiered to critical acclaim. IGN's Ramsey Isler wrote that it \\"changed the whole landscape of the show's main plot arc. Although there were some rough spots in the execution of this story, overall it's one hell of a way to end the season.\\" He rated the episode 8.6/10. While praising Noble's performance, Isler criticized some plot aspects. He was \\"kind of torn\\" on the Peter-Olivia kiss, wished Peter and the doomsday device had been set up more for the third season, and believed the Olivia-Fauxlivia interaction to be \\"a little strange,\\" as the two went from discussing their respective families to \\"ass kicking\\". Isler did praise the fight itself. Ken Tucker praised the acting and the writers, noting \\"The fact that the series can accommodate a fan like me only confirms what a well- wrought piece of pop culture Fringe has become.\\" Tucker included the second part of the season in his mid-year \\"Top 10\\" list for 2010, partly attributing this ranking to Fringe \\"offer[ing] the season's best cliffhanger\\", alongside Breaking Bad. Noel Murray declared that he enjoyed part two slightly more, grading it an A. He praised Torv and Noble's performances for \\"inhabiting their respective worlds so well\\", and Goldsman for \\"[shooting] this episode with an emphasis on the characters more than the setting\\". Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times felt the second part fulfilled all of the criteria for an incredible season finale: the season's arc had a \\"pay-off\\" he \\"didn't see coming\\" in the aftermath of Walternate crossing universes to take back Peter; the entire episode was an \\"event\\" because it spent more time in the parallel universe than ever before, and it had an \\"A+ cliffhanger\\". MTV's Fringe reviewer Josh Wigler enjoyed the ending, calling it \\"one heck of a cliffhanger!\\" James Poniewozik from Time Magazine positively compared both parts of the finale to The X-Files, writing that, unlike that series, Fringes standalone episodes contribute to the overall mythology of the show. To him the finale \\"demonstrates how well the show now manages to balance its far- fetched sci-fi with grounded character storylines.\\" Poniewozik concluded his review by expressing that it was not as strong as \\"Peter\\", but Over There' was a season-ender that did what it should‚Äîleft me wanting more\\". Many critics praised the many subtle differences between the two universes, while others lauded Leonard Nimoy's appearance as William Bell and his scenes with Walter. Website blogger io9 listed both parts of \\"Over There\\" as one of the select few \\"crucial\\" episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show, referring to it as \\"one of the most epic season finales ever\\". Another io9 reviewer called the ending one of the \\"best SF/fantasy cliffhangers ever shown on television\\" in a September 2010 list. The finale helped propel Fringe onto a number of 2010 \\"best of television\\" lists, including Digital Spy, Entertainment Weekly, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The Daily Beast, The New York Times, TV Squad, the New York Post, and IGN; the last of these named Fringe the best sci-fi series of 2010, beating fellow nominees Lost, Caprica, and Stargate Universe. Some critics predicted that, because of the increased focus on looking into the alternate universe and advancing its mythology, Fringes \\"monster-of-the- week\\" episodes would become less frequent. This could make it more difficult for casual viewers to follow the show in its third season. =Awards and nominations= Writers J.H. Wyman, Jeff Pinkner, and Akiva Goldsman submitted both parts of \\"Over There\\" for consideration in the Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series category at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, and director Goldsman made a submission of both parts for the Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series category. None of the three secured a nomination. Leonard Nimoy submitted part two for consideration in the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series category. He and fellow guest actor Peter Weller (who appeared in \\"White Tulip\\") were not chosen for nominations. At Entertainment Weeklys June 2010 voter-driven TV Season Finale Awards, Fringe was nominated for multiple awards, and won in several categories. The Olivia-Fauxlivia swap was named the \\"Best Non-Romantic Cliff-hanger\\" of the season and placed third for the \\"Single Most Clever Twist\\", but it also came in third place for \\"Single Weakest Twist\\". The ending scene with Walternate and Olivia was voted the winner of the \\"Spookiest Image\\" category. Olivia's kiss with Peter finished in fifth place for the \\"Best Kiss\\" category, and her fight with Fauxlivia placed second in the \\"Best Fight\\" category. In the \\"Biggest Regret That I Didn't See the Finale, I Just Read About It\\" category Fringe won third place.

Released in 2012 at the Venice Film Festival, the film was directed by Ariel Vromen, and stars Michael Shannon as Kuklinski, Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, and Ray Liotta. The Iceman showed at the 2012 Telluride Film Festival and the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival before receiving a limited release in cinemas in the United States on May 3, 2013. It expanded into more cinemas in the USA on May 17. It was released to DVD on September 3. Plot In the 1960s, Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) marries Deborah (Winona Ryder) and the couple have two daughters. Kuklinski keeps secrets from his family. He works dubbing pornographic films, which he then supplies to a mob operated syndicate, but he tells his family that he dubs Disney cartoons. Kuklinski is also deeply troubled. As a boy he was the subject of brutal beatings from his immigrant Polish father, shaping Kuklinski into an emotionally disturbed and intensely violent man. A man insults him after a game of pool so Kuklinski follows the man to his car and murders him by quickly slashing his throat. Another secret Kuklinski keeps is that his younger brother Joseph (Stephen Dorff) is serving a life sentence for raping and murdering a twelve-year-old girl. Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta), a powerful mobster, shuts down the pornographic film business in which Kuklinski was involved and brings him on board to work as a contract killer after Kuklinski passes an impromptu audition: killing a homeless man with Roy's gun. During the killing of Marty Freeman (James Franco) due to his knowledge of Josh Rosenthols' (David Schwimmer) whereabouts (who had been using DeMeo's name too freely in his business dealings), Kuklinski meets Robert Pronge (Chris Evans), another hitman for the mob. After DeMeo puts Kuklinski on suspension for allowing a teenage girl to live after witnessing a hit (Kuklinski reveals that he never kills children), he teams up with Pronge, who is a freelancer, and splits the contract payments with him in return for helping him on contract assassinations for DeMeo's boss Leo Marks (Robert Davi). During his suspension, Kuklinski begins to show more of his anger and rage, to the extent of destroying his own kitchen while having an argument with Deborah. Kuklinski also shows paranoia when he looks at a moving ice cream truck and instantly thinks of Pronge. While distracted, Kuklinski bumps his car into another vehicle, the man he hit gets out of his car and insults Kuklinski and his family. This causes Kuklinski to enter such a raging fit that he then initiates a high speed chase after the man through three neighborhoods, again putting his family in danger. DeMeo eventually finds out about all of this unauthorized employment after Kuklinski murders one of his associates on Leo's orders, and at the same time demands that Kuklinski sever all ties with him. Meanwhile, Kuklinski attempts to collect his $50,000 pay for the hit from Leo, but is denied the payment, prompting him to kill the mobster when he threatens his family. Kuklinski's daughter is later seriously injured by a hit-and-run car accident. Kuklinski suspects Pronge and shoots him in a public park. Following an undercover sting operation, Kuklinski is arrested in the year 1986. Neither his wife nor his daughters have ever suspected him of being a cold-blooded killer. Kuklinski admits to having committed over 100 vicious murders, both for personal reasons and for profit, in his 22-year career. After being sentenced to two life terms in prison he never sees his wife and daughters again. In real life, Barbara (Deborah's name in real life) and his daughters visited him in the hospital shortly before he died. As the movie ends, Kuklinski's only regret is hurting his family through the crimes he committed, and the dangers he put them in. In 2006, he dies in a prison hospital, from a rare inflammatory disease, just before he is to testify against a Gambino crime family underboss.

B. Alderman was an American architect who was very active in western Massachusetts and Connecticut during the late 19th and early 20th Century. Childhood and architectural training George Perkins Bissell Alderman was born September 20, 1862 to Eugene Clydon and Ellen Eliza (n√©e Holmes) Alderman. His full name, including the two middle initials he displayed throughout his life, derived from his father's Civil War service. Wounded in the Battle of Chancellorsville, Eugene Alderman was given up for dead until Captain George Perkins Bissell of the 25th Connecticut Infantry noticed his movement. Picking up the soldier and strapping him to his horse, he rode him to the nearest hospital, and in a feeling of indebtedness, the elder Alderman chose to name his first-born son after the man who saved him. As a young child he worked on the family farm and as a carpenter, and also attended school in East Granby, CT. The family moved to Plainville, Connecticut, where he attended school for a year, then worked at country store. In 1879 his family moved to Holyoke, Massachusetts, where he worked with his father as a carpenter. Eventually Alderman realized that he really desired to be an architect and to that end he entered the office of James A. Clough, architect, of Holyoke, where he worked for 5 years. He then moved to Chicago, Illinois where he found work in the offices of Cass Chapman, a prominent architect. Architectural practice Grand door of the Hadley Falls Trust Company Building; Alderman was also a member of the board of directors of that institution In 1885, Mr. Alderman returned to Holyoke and opened his own architectural office where he was later joined by his brother, Henry.

The book captures two main conclusions from this period. The first order conclusion of this book is about \\"what engineers know.\\" Five case studies from the history of aeronautical engineering are used to argue engineering often demands its own scientific discoveries. Thus, engineering should be understood as a knowledge-generating activity that includes applied science but is not limited to applied science.

Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics. Huntington, N.Y.: Krieger, 1975. Vincenti in effect had two whole careers: one as a cutting-edge aeronautical engineer and another as a leading historian of technology. This gave him a dual vantage point to think about how technological innovation works. Further, he broadened the relevance of engineering to society by co-founding a Stanford discipline called Values, Technology and Society in 1971‚Äînow called Science, Technology and Society.Walter C. Post interview 1997, http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1997/3/1997_3_20.shtml, accessed 23 Jan 2011, 2240. At the age of 90 he published his most recent work with William M. Newman, \\"On an Engineering Use of Engineering History\\" which appears in Technology and Culture.Walter Vincenti and William Newman. \\"On an Engineering Use of Engineering History,\\" Technology and Culture. Volume 48, Number 1, January 2007, pp. 245‚Äì247.  Background  What Engineers Know was first published in 1990 when Mr. Vincenti was 73 years old after full careers in aerospace engineering, the history of technology, and instructing. The five case studies used for evidence in this book come from the first half of the 20th century, 1908-1953. During this period the author worked at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) from 1940 to 1957.http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1997/3/1997_3_20.shtml, accessed 23 Jan 2011, 2245. Four of the five case studies used as evidence in this book were first published independently in Technology and Culture between 1979 and 1986. During this era, other authors were beginning to refute the view of engineering as only applied science.Bijker, Wiebe E., Thomas Parke Hughes, and T. J. Pinch. The Social Construction of Technological Systems : New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1987. p. 69. Then in 1990, Vincenti's five case studies indirectly supported this newer discourse about engineering as a knowledge-generating discipline.  Scope The profession of \\"engineering\\" encompasses a wide scope of practice. Thus, the author narrows the scope of his five case studies in three ways. First, viewed end-to-end, the engineering process contains three phases including design, construction/production and operation. These cases come largely from the design phase of engineering. One exception is the fifth case study on flush-riveted joints which involved an intimate interplay between design and production. Second, design can be categorized as normal or radical. These case studies pertain to normal design. Third, normal design itself is multi-leveled. These levels proceed from project definition down to overall design, major component design, subdivision of component design, and highly specific problems (like planform, airfoil and high-lift devices). These five case studies come mostly from these lower levels. Thus when combined, the scope of these case studies is design, normal design and highly specific problems at the lowest level, \\"to help redress the neglect of this large and essential area.\\"  Case Study Summary (What Engineers Know) The five case studies are organized by chapter. Chapter 2 regards airfoil design generally. The early work of Davis illustrates how useful engineering has been done by people who have no formal training in engineering. The Davis wing was instrumental even though Davis did not have the theoretical basis to know how or why. Chapter 3 is about how engineers design in accord with flying qualities satisfactory to pilots. This case study illustrates there can be a key relationship between human behavior and engineering requirements that can greatly affect the outcomes. As such, \\"artifactual design is a social activity.\\" Chapter 4 instructs the importance of control-volume analysis situations in mechanical design. Control volume analysis was missing in physics textbooks at the time. Thus, engineers had a scientific requirement that was not addressed adequately by any natural science. Importantly, such case studies are examples of why there is such a thing as \\"engineering science\\". Chapter 5 regards the dynamic problem of propeller design and selection. The propeller case study illustrates how engineers develop methods to account for the absence of required scientific theory. In this case \\"parameter variation\\" was used to map-out and survey a subject where no comprehensive scientific theory (in physics) existed. Finally, chapter 6 describes the problem of designing flush-riveted joints for aircraft. This case study conveys how requirements of production can have a reverse influence on design thus driving iterations between production and design. This case study also illustrates how there are aspects of engineering that cannot adequately be described as science such as the \\"feel\\" rivet mechanics developed for how much pressure to apply when completing the aircraft's aluminum stressed-skin structure (see \\"tacit knowledge\\" discussion below). An Epistemology of Engineering (How Engineers Know) Throughout the book, Walter Vincenti makes epistemology observations pertaining to engineering. The following are six of several observations made throughout the book.Note: there are many other epistemological observations made throughout the book including a high density of them in Chapter 7. These observations do not constitute an \\"engineering method\\" per se but offer a conjecture that they may point the way for further research. He wrote, \\"in the final paragraph of chapter 5, I also raised the question of whether it might be profitable to look for \\"engineering method\\" analogous to but distinguishable from scientific method that has been a fruitful concern for the history of science. Could it be that the variation- selection process outlined here is that method, with its distinctive features lying in the criterion of selection and the vicarious methods used to shortcut direct trial?\\" = Seven Interactive Elements of Engineering Learning = First, there is a pattern to the iterative engineering discovery process seen in the development of flying-quality specifications. This process is referred to as \\"Seven Interactive Elements of Engineering Learning\\" and includes: # Familiarization with vehicle and recognition of problem. # Identification of basic variables and derivation of analytical concepts and criteria. # Development of instruments/piloting techniques for in-flight measurements. # Growth and refinement of pilot opinion regarding desirable flying qualities. # Combine results from 2-4 into a deliberate scheme for flying-quality research. # Measurement of relevant flight characteristics for a cross section of aircraft. # Assessment of results and data on flight characteristics in light of pilot opinion to arrive at general specifications. The boldface from the original text isolates the steps in a subject-neutral manner. = Six Categories of Engineering Knowledge = Second, there is a pattern in the very categories of knowledge in engineering. These six categories of engineering knowledge are: # Fundamental design concepts # Criteria and specifications # Theoretical tools # Quantitative data # Practical considerations # Design instrumentalities = Seven Knowledge-Generating Activities= Third, Walter Vincenti sees a pattern in knowledge/science generating activities of engineering. These seven Knowledge-Generating Activities include: # Transfer from science # Invention # Theoretical engineering research # Experimental engineering research # Design practice # Production # Direct Trial = Relationship Between Categories and Activities = Fourth, by placing six categories of knowledge and the seven knowledge-generating activities on an x-y table, these knowledge generating activities cut across the categories of knowledge in a partially predictable way. The resulting table serves as an approximation for what engineering tasks may be likely to produce new engineering knowledge. The resulting diagram \\"is intended for discussion more than a set of hard and fast divisions.\\" = Engineering Knowledge Classification = Fifth, he re-classifies engineering knowledge itself. Knowledge generated by engineering may normally be categorized by phases such as design, production or operations. Another way to think about engineering knowledge categories is descriptive knowledge, prescriptive knowledge and tacit knowledge. He adds Gilbert Ryle's terms \\"knowing that\\" and \\"knowing how\\" to illustrate the aim of each knowledge category. \\"Knowing what or that\\" to do in engineering is a mixture of descriptive and prescriptive knowledge. \\"Knowing how\\" to do it is a mixture of prescriptive and tacit knowledge. Thus, these case studies show the need for all three kinds of knowledge in engineering. = Variation-Selection Model of Technological Innovation = Finally, he posits a variation-selection model for knowledge growth. At all levels of design hierarchy, growth of knowledge acts to increase the complexity and power of the variation-selection process by modifying both the mechanism for variation and expanding the processes of selection vicariously. Variation and selection each add two realistic principles for the advancement of technology: blindness to variation and unsureness of selection. Vincenti concludes that our blindness to the vast potential in variations of design does not imply a random or unpremeditated search. A blind person in an unfamiliar alleyway uses a cane to provide information to explore the constraints in an intentional way without having any idea where the alleyway leads. Likewise, engineers proceed in design ‚Äúblindly‚Äù in the sense that ‚Äúthe outcome is not completely foreseeable‚Äù thus the ‚Äúbest‚Äù potential variations are in some degree invisible. As a result, finding high functioning designs is not the norm. He notes, ‚Äúfrom the outside or in retrospect, the entire process tends to seem more ordered and intentional‚Äîless blind‚Äîthan it usually is.‚Äù However, Vincenti uses the differences between the Wright brothers and the French to show there is a range in how we manage blindness to variations. The Wright brothers designed a flying machine before the French even though they started experimenting at roughly the same time. The French 1) appealed to what little was known about the Wrights/Langley, 2) mental imaginings of what might succeed, and 3) guidance from growing flight experience. But ‚Äúsince [#1 and #3] were meager, however, the level of blindness, at least at first, was well nigh total.‚Äù What was the difference in the process between the Wrights and the French? The French trial and error process had less theoretical analysis (or new engineering knowledge). Since, ‚Äúthe French were not inclined toward theoretical analysis, variations could be selected for retention and refinement only by trails in flight.‚Äù For the Wrights, advancement of basic principles in theory via analysis lent to precise shortcuts to direct trials making the French process appear more exploratory in retrospect. Thus, the process of selection is aided by 1) theoretical analysis and 2) experiments (in, say, wind tunnels) in place of direct trial of actual (‚Äúovert‚Äù) versions in the environment. The growth in knowledge increases the power of vicarious trials in place of actual/direct trials. Uncertainty In the Variation- Selection Process (blindness in variation and unsureness in selection) In the long term, ‚Äúthe entire variation-selection process‚Äîvariation and selection together‚Äîis filled with uncertainty.‚Äù The level of uncertainty is affected by two things. First, ‚Äúuncertainty comes from the degree of blindness in the variations.‚Äù Uncertainty in the whole process decreases as technology matures‚Äîhe notes that aircraft designers of today operate with more ‚Äúsure- footedness‚Äù than the French of the early 1900s or even his era working at NACA. Yet, there is a paradox in decreasing blindness. While blindness decreases over time, advances simultaneously become more difficult to come by and more sophisticated... which in turn increases blindness! Thus the temptation to see a net decrease in blindesss ‚Äústems from an illusion.‚Äù The variation-selection process can create as much blindness as it reduces; just ask ‚Äútalented engineers who struggle to advance a mature technology like present-day aeronautics‚Ä¶‚Äù The second factor on uncertainty in the whole variation-selection model is ‚Äúunsureness‚Äù in the process of selection. Both vicarious and overt trials suffer from unsureness which adds complication to the variation selection model. But unlike blindness in variation, unsureness in selection decreases with the precision in both kinds of trials. Blindness and unsureness characterize the difficult or arduous nature of technology evolution in the variation-selection model. The author then reviews the five case studies retrospectively to demonstrate how variation-selection and blindness-unsureness were at work in each case. In total, \\"the cumulative growth of engineering knowledge as the result of individual variation- selection processes acts to change the nature of how those processes are carried out.\\"  See also  * Engineering * Airfoils * Davis wing * Control volume * Propellers * Flush rivets  References  Category:Engineering books Category:History of technology Category:1990 non-fiction books Category:Aviation books ","title":"What Engineers Know and How They Know It"},{"id":"30603533","text":"Juncus scheuchzerioides is a species of rush variously called short rush or greater rush.

The city is organized in a grid pattern that dates back to the early 19th century, where it is based on the former Townships of London and Westminster. Many roads follow a typical grid pattern, while others follow an alignment along certain bodies of water such as the Westminster Ponds and Thames River. Each geographical township's layout of roads are different. This has led to jogs in the road network, most of which have since been corrected.  Adelaide Street  Adelaide Street is a north‚Äìsouth arterial road in London, as well as in Middlesex Centre. The total length from Commissioners Road to its northern terminus is , of which is within the city limits of London. Its northern terminus is at Highway 7. It runs through London where it is bisected into northern and southern halves by the south branch of the Thames River and ends at Commissioners Road East. It continues south at Southdale Road East where it ends south of Newbold Street, just metres north of Highway 401. = History = The reason for the road interruption is because Westminster Ponds is situated between Commissioners and Southdale Roads. In the early 1970s, there had existed plans to extend Adelaide as a four-lane road to meet with Pond Mills Road at Southdale using a CNR track's right-of-way, or to meet with its southern continuation. These plans were abandoned after Westminster Ponds were declared an environmentally significant area. At the same time, transportation-oriented studies suggested that Adelaide Street South be connected with Exeter Road, the then-Highway 135. These plans have since been abandoned as Exeter Road was eventually connected to Highway 401 via a westbound-only interchange. The city outlined in their 2005 edition of their official plan to extend Adelaide Street south of Highway 401 to meet Sise Road at Wilton Grove Road. There is yet to be a timeline to be announced for this roadwork.  Byron Baseline Road  Byron Baseline Road is a main thoroughfare in the Byron section of London, extending west from the intersection of Commissioners Road with Springbank Drive to Westdel Bourne. There are proposals to align the west end with Elviage Drive. The road was originally known as Base Line Road, which was also the name of five other segments of road not connected to it, but altogether forming the base line of Westminster geographic township. The name was changed in the 1980s to distinguish it from the two remaining disconnected segments. One segment extended from what is now Old Wonderland Road to half-a-block east of Melcrest Road; it is now part of Eaton Park Drive. A segment known as Base Line Road East and Base Line Road West is extended off the base line north to join Southcrest Drive. The third segment runs between Emerson and Helena Avenues. A fourth segment is now Westmount Hills Drive. A possible additional segment is part of Chippendale Crescent. Base Line Road was never developed as a continuous roadway due to some obstructive terrain, particularly west of Westmount Drive. Commissioners Road is a continuous roadway close by.  Boler Road  Boler Road is a north‚Äìsouth arterial road, extending from the Thames River (where it connects to Sanatorium Road), southward through Byron to end at Southdale Road. Sanatorium Road continues north, joining Riverside Drive and ending at Oxford Street in the Oakridge area. = History = Boler Road originally ran southward from Old Bridge Road in Byron. In the mid-1960s, the one-lane truss bridge over the Thames River connecting Boler Road to Riverside Drive was replaced with a deck bridge, and Boler Road was diverted onto the new bridge. In the 1970s, there were conceptual plans to realign Boler Road south of Baseline Road to join Colonel Talbot Road north of Southdale Road. This bypass, which was never constructed, would have departed present-day Boler Road at Wayne Road. This area has since been developed. Prior to London's annexation of Westminster in 1993, the Westminster-section of Boler Road formed part of Middlesex County Road 26. There have been conceptual plans for a number of years to join Boler and Colonel Talbot Roads via an extension south of Southdale Road, which would join Colonel Talbot Road in the vicinity of Pack Road, north of Lambeth. A timeline for this extension has yet to be determined.  Bradley Avenue  Bradley Avenue is an east‚Äìwest arterial road in the southern portion of the city. = History = Compared to other major streets in London, Bradley Avenue has a relatively modern existence. Originally a two-block long connecting road between Wellington Road and Dearness Drive, its subsequent extension was the result of the massive suburban growth in the south end of the city during the 1970s and 1980s. The road was built in stages to correlate with this growth. Bradley Avenue is built on its own alignment between White Oak Road and Highbury Avenue, with the remainder of the road located on former Pond View Road, which was severed by Highbury Avenue in the 1960s. In 2007, it was voted as the second worst road in Ontario in a CAA poll. = Future extension = Bradley Avenue is proposed to be extended from its current western terminus at White Oak Road to connect with Pack Road. Construction is tied to the completion of new housing development in the area. No definitive time line is set for this construction.  Clarke Road  Clarke Road is an main thoroughfare in the eastern part of London, starting at Hamilton Road and proceeding north past the city limits to Highway 7. Much of the route is two-lane road.  Colonel Talbot Road  Highway 4 / Colonel Talbot Road looking north towards Lambeth from the Highway 4 / Highway 402 interchange in London. Colonel Talbot Road is a roadway in the London area. Its northernmost point starts at Byron Baseline Road in the east area of Byron and runs south to Lambeth, where it intersects with Longwoods Road and becomes Highway 4. From there, the highway crosses over Highway 402 and Highway 401 and ends shortly thereafter at Southminster Bourne (County Road 18), continuing south as Sunset Drive. Highway 4 continues a short distance to the south, to Highway 3 at Talbotville Royal. The road also continues a short distance north of Byron Baseline Road to Commissioners Road, as North Street. The road is named after Colonel Thomas Talbot, who was in charge of settling the area in the 19th century. For many years, the road was known as North Talbot Road, and assumed its current name in the late 1980s. Prior to the City of London annexation of Westminster Township in 1993, the road was also known as Middlesex County Road 40 north of Lambeth. Colonel Talbot Road interchanges with Highway 401 using an outdated cloverleaf interchange design. This junction is planned to be reconstructed along with the widening of Highway 401 between Highway 4 and Highway 402 (including a new interchange with Wonderland Road).  Commissioners Road  Commissioners Road is an east‚Äìwest thoroughfare south of the Thames River. Although it roughly parallels Base Line Road (which was never completely built as Concession Road 1 of Westminster Township), it is the next main thoroughfare north of Southdale Road, extending in the east to join Hamilton Road, and in the west to join Oxford Street West. Commissioners has a steep-winding hill between Springbank Drive and Westmount Drive; there is a corridor outlined on the city official plan to circle around this hill, but although it has been identified for several decades, there is no time line for it to be built.  Dingman Drive  The Highway 401 / Highway 402 interchange viewed from the Dingman Drive overpass. Dingman Drive is a rural arterial road in south-central London at the edge of the city's urban growth boundary. It overpasses Highway 401 just east of the Highway 402 interchange. The road starts in the west at Wonderland Road and ends in the east at Westchester Bourne in Thames Centre.  Dundas Street  Dundas Street is a very long (albeit broken) historic route running from London to Toronto. The portion within London runs for as a main east‚Äìwest road through central and eastern London. Much of it was designated as Highway 2 until the late 1990s. It begins where Riverside Drive eastbound crosses the Thames River, and ends at the eastern city limits, although travelers continuing east through Thamesford and Woodstock also will still be on Dundas Street until it changes its name to Governors Road and becomes discontinuous near Paris. Except in the downtown core, west of Wellington Street, the road is a four-lane road, with no median strip. A former western section, Dundas Street West, was incorporated into Riverside Drive in the 1970s. For the entirety of the street between London and Toronto, see Dundas Street.  Fanshawe Park Road  Fanshawe Park Road is a east‚Äìwest arterial road. It extends from the Fanshawe Conservation Area east of Clarke Road westward to the city limits where it continues as Egremont Drive, Middlesex County Road 22. Fanshawe Park is bisected into eastern and western halves by Richmond Street. Although there is no exit east of Clarke Road, prior to the construction of the Clarke Road bridge over the Thames River, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority permitted through traffic between the east end of Fanshawe and the current Fanshawe Park entrance on Clarke Road between Huron and Kilally, crossing the Thames on the flood-control structure. The old north entrance has been gated for many years since then. Prior to the completion of the Fanshawe Dam, Fanshawe went downhill and crossed the river on a bridge before climbing to connect with Crumlin Side Road, at what is now the intersection of Lakeside Drive and Wye Creek Drive in Thames Centre's West Nissouri Township.  Hamilton Road  Hamilton Road is a main east‚Äìwest route, on a diagonal with the grid network, from the core area to the southeast city limits. Although it begins at Bathurst and Burwell Streets, it does not become a thoroughfare for two blocks, where it crosses Horton Street. When it reaches the junction with Commissioners Road and Old Victoria Road, it continues east as if a natural continuation of Commissioners Road. Its name apparently references its 19th-century history as a road used for travelers headed to the city of Hamilton.  Highbury Avenue  Highbury Avenue is a main thoroughfare in the eastern part of London, in the form of a former sideroad in London Township, from Hamilton Road northward. South of Hamilton Road, Highbury Avenue is a municipal expressway in the southeast part of the city, built in 1966 as part of a larger expressway plan that was cancelled amid public opposition. The expressway connects to Highway 401. Highbury Avenue continues south as a two-lane road to St. Thomas. At varying times, the portion of Highbury between Hamilton and Fanshawe Park Roads was rebuilt from a 2-lane road to a 4-lane road.  Horton Street  Horton Street is a main thoroughfare in the core area of London, the most direct and widest artery south of the CNR railway tracks, between Hamilton Road and Springbank Drive. = History = Horton Street was originally part of the grid of streets south of the CNR tracks, with its west end at Thames Street and most traffic turning a block east at Ridout to enter or exit Horton. The east end was mainly residential, with traffic flowing onto and off of Hamilton just east of Maitland Street where Horton meets Hamilton. After years of controversy, in 1985, Horton was extended west across the Thames River, between the CNR tracks and Beaconsfield Avenue to Wharncliffe Road, then assumed the Beaconsfield right-of-way from there to end at Springbank Drive.  Huron Street  Huron Street is a main thoroughfare in the eastern part of London, traversing the north edge of the city's older grid-network neighbourhoods, from the Thames River at Gibbons Park to the London International Airport. It is interrupted for by a ravine between William and Maitland Streets. A 1971 official plan envisioned construction of the missing link, but is not now expected, the road to the west being of minor significance, and amid environmental considerations through the ravine. Most of the route is two-lane road. Historically, Huron Street extended east to Crumlin Sideroad at the east edge of London Township (closed to traffic upon development of military operational areas at the airport, but partly reopened in the 1990s), and there have been plans to extend it west across the Thames River to Western Road, connecting with an orphan segment between the river and Western Road which has now been renamed as part of the roadways at Western University. There is no current information on the routing of Huron in the vicinity of William and Maitland prior to the development of the area as part of London.  Hyde Park Road  Hyde Park Road is an north‚Äìsouth arterial road in London, Ontario, Canada. It extends from the Thames River in the Oakridge area northward through the village and road namesake of Hyde Park and north of the city to Highway 7. = History = Hyde Park Sideroad originally ran northward on a fairly straight alignment through the lowlands east of the Byron Bog. North of Oxford Street, it crossed the Canadian National Railway via a narrow truss bridge, and then crossed the Canadian Pacific Railway south of Hyde Park via a one-lane subway. In the early 1980s, Hyde Park Road was largely bypassed to the east between Oxford Street and Riverside Drive, completely avoiding the environmentally sensitive area near the bog which also included very steep grades. In the 1970s, there were conceptual plans for Hyde Park Road to bypass Hyde Park, to the east. This bypass was never constructed. In 1985, the CNR and CPR grade separations were replaced with new, wider structures. Hyde Park Road experienced a high degree of traffic congestion between Oxford Street and Fanshawe Park Road. Construction to widen this segment of the road from two lanes to four was completed in 2016.  King Street  King Street is an east‚Äìwest road along a pair of rights-of-way between the Thames River and Highbury Avenue, broken into two segments by the closure of part of that right-of-way for Queens Park. Its western segment is a eastbound one-way road that complements westbound Queens Avenue, and has many older business establishments as well as passing through the midst of the large downtown mall. The eastern segment, separated from the other by Queens Park, is a two-way road that formerly extended another to Florence Street. Plans have existed since at least 1970 to construct a bridge at the west end to divert Riverside Drive traffic off of Dundas. Historically, King Street connected across the river with Becher Street, a residential street; the bridge still exists, but has been closed since the 1960s and is limited to pedestrian traffic.  Oxford Street  Oxford Street is a east‚Äìwest arterial road. It extends from Crumlin Road near London International Airport westward through the city to the western limits of the city, where it continues as Middlesex County Road 14. Until 2003, Oxford Street ended at the Thames River heading westward. In November of that year, a new bridge opened, extending Oxford Street westward over the river and linking it with Commissioners Road west of Kains Road. Commissioners Road west of there became part of Oxford Street, and Commissioners Road itself was truncated at the new Oxford Street extension. The bridge was built wide enough to accommodate four lanes of traffic, but has remained two lanes wide. Oxford Street was widened from two lanes to four lanes from the C.N.R. subway to Hyde Park Road in 2006, and further to Sanatorium Road in 2013.  Quebec Street  Quebec Street is a north‚Äìsouth road, extending from Dundas Street to Oxford Street, crossing the C.P.R. switching yard via a long bridge and providing the only crossing between Highbury and Adelaide. At the south end, it is in close proximity to Egerton Street, another north‚Äìsouth road that supplements arterial roads.  Queens Avenue  Queens Avenue is a east‚Äìwest one-way road that relieves westbound traffic loads on Dundas Street, which is one block to the south, and complements eastbound King Street two blocks south. The first block is relatively quiet, but becomes a busy artery carrying traffic west before merging with Riverside Drive just past the Thames River. Traffic westbound on Dundas toward Riverside is diverted north at Ridout to follow Queens. Although it bypasses the commercial core along Dundas, Queens passes several important institutional buildings, including office towers that house an insurance company, major central churches, government buildings, and the previous location of the central library. With two westbound lanes, fewer signalized intersections and more residential areas, it provides a slightly faster transit westward. Originally, Queens Avenue ended at Ridout Street, but the bridge over the Thames River was constructed around 1970 to connect to Riverside Drive (at that time, known as Dundas Street West). Later in the 1970s, Dundas Street West was extended past Wharncliffe Road to connect to Mount Pleasant Avenue at Woodward Street, providing a continuous traffic route from Quebec Street to Sanitorium Road; the roadway west of the Thames was shortly afterward renamed as Riverside Drive.  Richmond Street  Richmond Street is an main thoroughfare from the core area of London to the northern limits. It starts at the Thames River where it connects with the residential Carfrae Crescent, passing through the core of the city, veering westward beyond Huron Street and continuing northward beyond Windermere Road. It is a four-lane undivided road along most of its length, including the core area.  Riverside Drive  Riverside Drive is a east‚Äìwest arterial road. It extends from the Forks of the Thames River in the Downtown area westward towards the suburb of Byron. The name was created due to its close proximity to the Thames River. = History = The modern-day Riverside Drive is made up of three separate London roads. The original Riverside Drive of existed from the Thames River at Byron to the Canadian National Railway bridge near Mount Pleasant Cemetery; a part of Mount Pleasant Avenue, which originally existed from the CNR bridge to Wharncliffe Road, and Dundas Street West west of the forks of the Thames River to Wharncliffe Road. In the 1970s, Dundas Street West (0.50 km) was extended through the Kensington neighbourhood west from Wharncliffe Road to meet Mount Pleasant Avenue west of Charles Street. This necessitated the demolition of a number of houses in Kensington. The Dundas extension was built as a four-lane facility. Previously traffic heading westbound on Dundas Street West had to turn right at Wharncliffe Road in order to get to Mount Pleasant Avenue. The original CNR bridge connecting Riverside Drive to Mount Pleasant Avenue included sharp curves at the approaches, as the bridge crossed at a 90-degree angle to the railway tracks. In 1974, the corridor was realigned with a new deck bridge located just north of the original one. This bridge was built wide enough to accommodate a four-lane road, but the road remains two lanes today. Around this time the Riverside Drive designation was extended eastward along Mount Pleasant Avenue and Dundas Street West to the Kensington Bridge. Riverside Drive was also realigned in 1977 at Hutton Road when the Guy Lombardo Bridge was built, with a four-lane diversion to the north of the original alignment.  Southdale Road  Southdale Road is a east‚Äìwest arterial road. It extends from Pond Mills Road westward through the city to the western limits of the city with its terminus at Westdel Bourne. Southdale is 2-lanes from Pond Mills Road to Millbank Drive, 3-lanes to Adelaide Street South, 2-lanes to Dearness Drive, a block east of Wellington Road, where it expands to 4-lanes. London had looked into feasibility studies of expanding Southdale Road in between Wharncliffe and Wonderland to a 4-lane road. This would be to reduce traffic congestion due to recent development of big box stores and housing in the area. Construction began in the summer of 2013, and is now complete.http://london.ca/d.aspx?s=/Transportation/trans_planning.htm From Wellington, across Wharncliffe to west of Wonderland Road it now continues as a 4-lane road, and goes back to 2-lanes thereafter.  Springbank Drive  Originally known as \\"Pipe Line Road\\", Springbank Drive connects on its east end with Wharncliffe Road South, and passes through residential areas before bordering the south side of Springbank Park. When it meets Commissioners Road 5.1 km from Wharncliffe, traffic proceeding straight through continues along Byron Base Line Road along the south edge of the original Byron village site to Westdel Bourne. (This section originally was known simply as Base Line Road, which is also the name of two disconnected segments to the east.) Springbank Drive is four-lanes west as far as Wonderland, where it narrows to a two-lane road, parts of it against a steep hill between Springbank Park and the reservoir hill. The west end of Horton Street is oriented to directly continue traffic with Springbank; Springbank east of this point is connected to Horton-Springbank at a regular right-angle intersection.  Sunningdale Road  Sunningdale Road, long, is the northernmost east‚Äìwest arterial road in London. Albeit largely rural in nature, it has recently seen development between Wonderland Road and Adelaide Street. Its western terminus is at Vanneck Road in Middlesex Centre and extends eastward to Fanshawe Golf Course east of Clarke Road. It passes through the neighbourhoods of Foxhollow, Upper Richmond Village, Northcrest, and Stoney Creek. Sunningdale Road is bisected into eastern and western halves by Richmond Street. In 1993, most of the road became a part of London following an annexation from the Township of London. In 2014, a roundabout opened at Wonderland Road North. In 2017, Highway 4 was rerouted through London, using Sunningdale between Wonderland and Richmond as the new route.  Veterans Memorial Parkway  The Veterans Memorial Parkway (VMP) is a expressway located in London, Ontario, with a 2.0 km non-expressway extension north to Huron Street. The expressway was previously known as Highway 100 from 1977 until 1994 and as Airport Road prior to September 2006. It is currently an at-grade, four-lane expressway. Long term plans / proposals for the route include north and south extensions of the road and grade separated interchanges along its entire length, converting it to a freeway.  Wellington Road  Wellington Street in downtown London viewed from city hall. Wellington Road / Highway 401 interchange: London's downtown gateway. Wellington Road is a major arterial road which forms a key route for both local and out-of-town traffic between St. Thomas, Highway 401 and London's downtown core. It runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction for most of its length. As of 2013, the section between Commissioners and Southdale Roads is London's most travelled at 48,000 vehicles per day. Most of the Wellington Road corridor is home to many commercial and institutional establishments such as White Oaks Mall, LHSC Victoria Hospital and various hotels and restaurants. North of the Thames River, it adjoins Wellington Street, which extends along a right-of-way through the core area and quickly becomes a residential street at Central Avenue, interrupted for at the CPR railway tracks, and ending near Huron Street.  Westdel Bourne  Westdel Bourne is a rural arterial road in west London near the city's limits. It starts in the north at Kains Road in the Riverbend neighborhood and ends in the south at Southminster Bourne in Southwold Township. It was the townline for the then-Townships of Westminster and Delaware. In 1990, the Town of Westminster renamed several roads. The townline's new name, Westdel, came from a combination of the two municipalities. \\"Bourne\\" was derived from an old English word meaning \\"dividing line\\". London acquired part of this road pursuant to its annexation of Westminster in 1993. The remainder (south of Westminster Drive) was ceded to Delaware Township.  Western Road  Western Road is a north‚Äìsouth arterial road which skirts around the west side of the University of Western Ontario campus, University Hospital, and various student residences including Saugeen-Maitland Hall. Western Road starts at Richmond Street just south of the Masonville Place shopping centre continuing southward to connect with Wharncliffe Road. = History = Western Road takes its name after the University of Western Ontario and is one of the main access routes to the campus. It also acts as a key corridor for traffic bypassing some of the older, more congested neighborhoods of north London. The road was primary rural until the 1960s, becoming more urbanized with the growth of the university. Expansive residential growth in North London, along with its proximity to the university campus and hospital, led to serious road deficiencies. The road experienced congestion during peak travel periods as well as numerous potholes and worn pavement. Due to this, Western Road was nominated as one of the worst roads in Ontario by the Canadian Automobile Association . In 2007, Western Road was widened to four lanes from Huron University College to Richmond Street. The road now features a wide, treed boulevard within the campus area.  Wharncliffe Road  Wharncliffe Road is a main thoroughfare just west of the core area of London. It starts with a 300-metre one-block residential section north of Western Road, then serves as a main artery from the south end of Western Road, across Oxford Street, Riverside Drive, the Thames River, Horton Street and Commissioners Road, to Southdale, where it turns to the southwest, following the route of the former London and Lake Erie Railway (discontinued before 1920) to end in Lambeth where it adjoins Main Street.  White Oak Road  White Oak Road follows a path in London's south end, starting in a residential area at the south side of the Highland Country Club and continuing southward to Harry White Drive. It is situated midway between (and runs parallel to) Wellington Road and Wonderland Road.  Wonderland Road  Wonderland Road is a major north‚Äìsouth, arterial road and one of the busiest roads in London, carrying on average over 45,000 vehicles daily between Springbank Drive and Riverside Drive in 2002. With completion of an interchange with Highway 401 in 2016, Wonderland forms a continuous route from Highway 7 in the north to just north of Highway 3 near Talbotville Royal, making it one of only two thoroughfares connecting to both the north and south city limits. Wonderland Road takes its name from the Wonderland Gardens concert hall located near Springbank Park. The present-day Wonderland Road corridor is made up of part or all of six London-area roads.  York Street  York Street is a main thoroughfare in downtown London, preferred over Dundas Street (two blocks north) as a main artery through the core area as it is a four-lane road along its entire length east of Ridout Street until just west of Rectory Street. At Rectory Street, it is interrupted by the Queens Park grounds, and traffic east of Rectory follows Florence Street (three blocks south of Dundas) as far as Highbury (for north- and south-bound traffic), or continuing to Dundas for eastbound traffic. At the west end, it connects over the Thames River with Stanley Street, which extends 0.55 km to Wharncliffe Road. At one time, an extension was considered beyond Wharncliffe, south under the CNR tracks to connect with Beaconsfield Avenue and continue to Springbank Drive. Instead, city council chose to build the Horton Street extension which then followed Beaconsfield Avenue west from Wharncliffe to join Springbank Drive. A second section of York Street runs between Egerton Street and Highbury Avenue, as a local residential street.

He was portrayed by Ken Blackburn and was introduced as Chris Warner's (Michael Galvin) womanizing father. The character of Bruce was written with antagonistic characteristics, with his storylines often focusing on his rivalry with CEO Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins) and his attempts at taking over the hospital. He would often go behind his families backs and either try buy out the hospital or indulge in numerous affairs. Bruce's wish was finally granted in 1995 when Michael retired, however only after signing the ownership deal of the hospital did Bruce realize Michael had the last laugh as Bruce was shafted from any managerial positions, only being a silent partner. Bruce's arrogant persona alongside his constant womanizing, had a severe effect on both of his sons with Chris becoming the mirror image of his father and Guy (Craig Parker) blaming Bruce for his drug addiction. Creation and casting Ken Blackburn was cast in the sporadic role of Chris Warner's father Bruce. Blackburn struggled consistently throughout his stints with the writers for what he saw an unnecessary antagonism in the character of Bruce. He found Bruce unrealistically \\"abrasive\\" and hugely impolite. The character was eventually killed off following a stint of several episodes in 1995. Storylines Sir Bruce visits his son Chris (Michael Galvin) in and attempted to purchase the clinic to no success. He returns and invested money into a new private ward and carried out a union vote to implement him as the new Chief Executive Officer of the hospital. Even with the help of Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison), Bruce fell short and remained a share holder. Bruce confronts Michael (Paul Gittins) following the poaching of Grace Kwan (Lynette Forday) from his hospital. Bruce soon admitted to being in love with her, straining his marriage to Margot (Glynis McNicoll) even further. The following year Bruce learned he was going to be a grandfather when his son Guy's (Craig Parker) girlfriend Carmen (Theresa Healey) fell pregnant. However Bruce was diagnosed with terminal cancer and dropped the bombshell that Guy was the product of an affair. Bruce dies and Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) claims Bruce had retracted his will on his deathbed. Later in 2003 Margot returned to town shortly after Toni Thompson's (Laura Hill) brother Dominic (Shane Cortese) arrived. The two claimed that Dom was the product of an affair Bruce had, thus making him Chris' brother. However it soon turned out not to be the case and Dom ended up trying to murder Chris. Then in 2012 Marj Brasch (Elizabeth McRae) praised Bruce for his determination to set up the clinic alongside Michael. Reception Blackburn found portraying the character in such an antagonistic manner saw a lot of negative response, something he did not mind as it was expected. Michael Galvin (Chris Warner) found filming Bruce's final storyline that saw his health deteriorate, difficult, as his own father was going through a similar experience. He later recounted this as one of his worst moments on the soap.

Project risk is defined by PMI as, \\"an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project‚Äôs objectives.\\" Project risk management remains a relatively undeveloped discipline, distinct from the risk management used by Operational, Financial and Underwriters' risk management. This gulf is due to several factors: Risk Aversion, especially public understanding and risk in social activities, confusion in the application of risk management to projects, and the additional sophistication of probability mechanics above those of accounting, finance and engineering. With the above disciplines of Operational, Financial and Underwriting risk management, the concepts of risk, risk management and individual risks are nearly interchangeable; being either personnel or monetary impacts respectively. Impacts in project risk management are more diverse, overlapping monetary, schedule, capability, quality and engineering disciplines. For this reason, in project risk management, it is necessary to specify the differences (paraphrased from the \\"Department of Defense Risk, Issue, and Opportunity Management Guide for Defense Acquisition Programs\\"): *Risk Management: Organizational policy for optimizing investments and (individual) risks to minimize the possibility of failure. *Risk: The likelihood that a project will fail to meet its objectives. *A risk: A single action, event or hardware component that contributes to an effort's \\"Risk.\\" An improvement on the PMBOK definition of risk management is to add a future date to the definition of a risk.Department of Defense Risk, Issue, and Opportunity Management Guide for Defense Acquisition Programs, June 2015 Mathematically, this is expressed as a probability multiplied by an impact, with the inclusion of a future impact date and critical dates. This addition of future dates allows predictive approaches. Good Project Risk Management depends on supporting organizational factors, having clear roles and responsibilities, and technical analysis. Chronologically, Project Risk Management may begin in recognizing a threat, or by examining an opportunity. For example, these may be competitor developments or novel products. Due to lack of definition, this is frequently performed qualitatively, or semi-quantitatively, using product or averaging models. This approach is used to prioritize possible solutions, where necessary. In some instances it is possible to begin an analysis of alternatives, generating cost and development estimates for potential solutions. Once an approach is selected, more familiar risk management tools and a general project risk management process may be used for the new projects: * A Planning risk management * Risk identification and monetary identification * Performing qualitative risk analysis * Communicating the risk to stakeholders and the funders of the project * Refining or iterating the risk based on research and new information * Monitoring and controlling risks Finally, risks must be integrated to provide a complete picture, so projects should be integrated into enterprise wide risk management, to seize opportunities related to the achievement of their objectives.  Project risk management tools  In order to make project management effective, the managers use risk management tools. It is necessary to assume the measures referring to the same risk of the project and accomplishing its objectives. The project risk management (PRM) system should be based on the competences of the employees willing to use them to achieve the project‚Äôs goal. The system should track down all the processes and their exposure which occur in the project, as well as the circumstances that generate risk and determine their effects. Nowadays, the Big Data (BD) analysis appears an emerging method to create knowledge from the data being generated by different sources in production processes. According to G√≥recki, the BD seems to be the adequate tool for PRM.

He returned to the Royal Air Force in World War II, serving as an air gunner during the Battle of Britain. Early life Sydney Carlin was born in Hull, the son of William Carlin, a drysalter. By 1901 he was a boarder at a small private school in the village of Soulby, Kirkby Stephen, Westmoreland. He enlisted with the 18th Royal Hussars in 1908, but he bought himself out and resigned in December 1909 for the sum of ¬£18. In 1911 he was working as a farm labourer at Frodingham Grange, North Frodingham, Yorkshire. World War I He re-enlisted on 8 August 1915; the army refunded half (¬£9) of the money he had bought himself out with in 1909. Serving in Belgium with the 18th Royal Hussars he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal on 5 August 1915, and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in September 1915 and made a lieutenant in May 1916. He lost a leg serving in the Battle of Longueval/Delville Wood, on the Somme in 1916, while commanding a Royal Engineers Field Company section holding a trench against repeated German counter-attacks. For this action he was awarded the Military Cross in October. Extraordinarily, he joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1917, following his recovery. On 12 March 1918, Carlin was seconded from the Royal Engineers to the RFC. After serving as an instructor at the Central Flying School, he was posted in May 1918 to No. 74 Squadron RFC flying S.E.5As, where he earned his nickname \\"Timbertoes\\". Carlin is recorded as an ace balloon buster, with five balloons downed; he was also an ace against aircraft, with four machines claimed destroyed, and one aircraft 'driven down out of control'. His exploits earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross. On 9 August 1918 Lieutenant Carlin was promoted to temporary captain. Note: This promotion was customarily linked to appointment to a flight commander. In early September he was involved in a mid-air collision with his commanding officer, Major Keith Caldwell, but was relatively unscathed. On 21 September Carlin was shot down over Hantay by Unteroffizier Siegfried Westphal of Jasta 29 and held as a prisoner of war. He was repatriated on 13 December 1918 and admitted to the RAF Central Hospital on Christmas Day 1918. Carlin relinquished his commission on \\"account of ill- health contracted on active service\\" on 7 August 1919. and retained the rank of lieutenant. Inter-war years On 1 January 1924 Carlin was promoted from flight lieutenant to squadron leader. Nevertheless, in 1924, Carlin departed Britain for Mombasa aboard the SS Madura. He was listed on the passenger list as an \\"agriculturist\\". He farmed for some years in Kenya. From 20 May 1931 to 8 August 1935 Carlin served as the Justice of the Peace for Kisumu-Londiani District, Kenya.(Kenya Gazette, 13 August 1935) p. 902. World War II On re-enlistment to the RAF he was graded as a probationary pilot officer on 27 July 1940. He made pilot officer in September 1940, flying as an air gunner in Defiant aircraft with No. 264 Squadron RAF and later No. 151 Squadron RAF. He also made several unofficial trips as an air gunner with No. 311 (Czech) Squadron, flying Wellingtons. Carlin was injured in action at RAF Wittering during an enemy bombing raid on 7/8 May 1941, and died in Peterborough on 9 May 1941. He is memorialized on the Screen Wall, Panel 1, Hull Crematorium.

In 1953 Josef von B√°ky remade the film in Germany, based on the original script by Czinner and Mayer. The script would be Mayer's last, as he would die of cancer in 1944. Synopsis The wife (Bergner) of a violin player (Brent) in a famous orchestra, falls in love with her husband's friend and, tragically, drowns herself. Reception The film was well received by critics, but not as financially successful as had been hoped. Writing for The Spectator in 1937, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed review, describing it as \\"a shapely piece of sentiment\\" with a story \\"neat and plausible, the acting refined, the photography expensive\\".

Plot A young boy, Dong-Dong and his sister spend a summer vacation at their grandparents' house in the country while their mother recuperates from an illness; they while away the hours climbing trees, swimming in a stream, searching for missing cattle, and coming uneasily to grips with the enigmatic and sometimes threatening realities of adult life. Reception The Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review, calling the film a \\"lyrical childhood remembrance\\" and praising the \\"fine, unsentimental attention to childhood incident.\\" References External links Category:Taiwanese films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:1984 films Category:1984 drama films Category:Films directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien Category:Films with screenplays by Chu T‚Äôien-wen Category:Taiwanese drama films ","title":"A Summer at Grandpa's"},{"id":"30604228","text":"UK Cover Art for single lp version Johnny Mathis Sings the Music of Bacharach & Kaempfert is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released in the fall of 1970 by Columbia Records. While one half of the two-record set was a compilation of tracks from his previous albums that were composed by Burt Bacharach, the other consisted of new recordings of songs composed by Bert Kaempfert, including a new version of \\"Strangers in the Night\\", which Mathis had already recorded in 1966 for his LP Johnny Mathis Sings. Although the Kaempfert tribute was similar to recent Mathis albums in that he was mainly covering songs made popular by other singers, it was absent of hits from the 12 months previous to its release that had become the pattern of his output at this point. The latest US chartings of any of the Kaempfert compositions as of this album's debut came from 1967 recordings of \\"Lady\\" by Jack Jones and \\"The Lady Smiles\\" by Matt Monro.. The album made its first appearance on Billboard magazine's Top LP's chart in the issue dated January 23, 1971, and reached number 169 during its seven weeks there..

She is a four-time provincial junior champion, three time provincial women's champion and 2007 Canadian Junior champion and World Junior silver medalist. Curling career Curtis represented Newfoundland and Labrador at the 2003 Canada Games, placing 7th. Curtis won her first provincial junior championship in 2004. Her debut performance as skip of team Newfoundland and Labrador at the 2004 Canadian Junior Curling Championships was somewhat successful, the rink finished with an 8‚Äì4 record, just missing the playoffs. Devereaux would win her second straight provincial junior crown the following year. Her record at the 2005 Canadian Junior Curling Championships was not as great, having finished with a 5‚Äì7 record. Curtis won a third straight provincial title in 2006. Once again she missed the playoffs at the Canadian Juniors, finishing with a 5‚Äì6 record. Devereaux won her fourth and final provincial junior championship in 2007. Her performance at the Canadian Juniors was much better. Her team of Steph Guzzwell, Sarah Paul and Julie Devereaux finished the round robin in first place with an 11‚Äì1 record. Curtis defeated Manitoba's Calleen Neufeld 7‚Äì6 in the final to win the Canadian Junior championship. This marked the first time a team from Newfoundland and Labrador won a women's Canadian Junior championship. This qualified her to represent Canada at the 2007 World Junior Curling Championships. Curtis finished the round robin with a 6‚Äì3 record, in 2nd place behind the United States. She beat Denmark 10‚Äì6 in the semi-final only to lose to Scotland's Sarah Reid 7‚Äì6 in the final. In 2009, she played in her first provincial championship. She finished with a 2‚Äì4 record. The following year, she improved to a 4‚Äì2 record, losing to Heather Strong in the semi-finals.

This qualified Curtis for the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, where she finished in last place with a 1‚Äì10 record. Curtis would not return to the Hearts in 2012, as her team lost in the provincial semi-final. However, the following year, she went on to win her second provincial title, and once again represent Newfoundland and Labrador at the Hearts. At the 2013 Scotties Tournament of Hearts she once again struggled, finishing with a 2‚Äì9 record. The next two seasons, Curtis struggled at the provincial championships going 1-3 at the 2014 Newfoundland and Labrador Scotties Tournament of Hearts and 0-4 in 2015. Finally, she won another provincial title in 2016, winning all four of her matches. Representing her province at the 2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, she finished with a 3-8 record.

She was the eldest sibling in the Cooper family unit. Creation and casting In June 2010, Jacqueline Nairn joined the cast of Shortland Street as red headed nurse, Wendy Cooper. After several months on screen, it was announced that Wendy's family would be introduced throughout the remainder of the year. Nairn was excited by the prospect and stated, \\"The actors who are playing my children are awesome. We are having a lot of fun connecting and I think viewers are really going to enjoy learning about the Coopers over the next little while.\\" Nairn was said to look forward as to how the Cooper's would \\"weave\\" into Ferndale and promised they would \\"rock the boat.\\" Amelia Reid was a recent graduate from Toi Whakaari drama school, when she auditioned for the role of Penny Rourke on the soap, and though she missed out on the role, she was later hired to play the part of the eldest child in the Cooper family, Bella Cooper. Reid was delighted to win the role and stated, \\"I'm loving my time on Shortland Street so far. My first day on set was terrifying, exhilarating and wonderful all in one. I feel extremely blessed to be a full- time actor, being paid to play make believe.\\" She compared her character to the iconic and long running former receptionists, Marj Brasch (Elizabeth McRae) and Waverley Harrison (Claire Chitham). After Reid-Meredith fell pregnant in late 2014, producers incorporated the pregnancy into the storyline. In mid 2016, Reid-Meredith decided to take \\"a break and pursue other projects and opportunities\\" and quit the show. Producer Maxine Fleming ensured the exit storyline would be \\"kept under wraps\\" but Reid-Meredith remained optimistic about a potential return to the show, \\"sometimes you just have to follow your heart and do what you feel is right at the time, and I definitely won't say I will never be back!\\" Bella departed in 7 November 2016. Reid-Meredith reprised her role for a guest stint in December 2019. Storylines Bella arrived to the hospital when it was revealed she had been dropped from her prestigious beauty course for burning a man's face. She quickly gained the job of receptionist and developed an intense crush on Brodie Kemp (Ari Boyland). The two soon started to date and after initially clashing with co worker Yvonne Jeffries (Alison Quigan), she and Bella became good friends. Bella and Brodie broke up and she became briefly engaged to manipulative doctor Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) before she and Brodie reunited. The couple planned to flee New Zealand to escape some criminals after Brodie but he left her behind and she turned her attentions to an unrequited crush on Daniel Potts (Ido Drent). However, as the year ended, Bella discovered she had fallen in love with Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) and narrowly survived a murder attempt by his ex-fiancƒóe's father, Costel (Phil Peloton). Bella and Luke got together and after she saved a young boys life, she briefly decided to become a doctor. The couple got engaged but Bella was devastated when Luke was diagnosed with a vicious brain tumour the night before the wedding. Nonetheless, the two got married. Following Luke's death, Bella inherited a small fortune but was shocked to discover Luke had accidentally fathered a child, Luca Dobra (Charlie Truman). She gave much of her money to Luca and began to date Josh Gallagher (Chris Tempest). It soon turned out Josh was seriously mentally ill and Bella broke up with him, only for Josh to die in an explosion he set off at the staff Christmas function. Bella moved in with Emma (Amy Usherwood) and Kylie (Kerry-Lee Dewing0, began to date Dallas Adams (Cameron Jones). The two got engaged but Bella decided she had not properly grieved for Luke enough to get married again and the two broke up. Bella started to date her foster brother Kane's (KJ Apa) father Jimmy (Joel Tobeck) and fell pregnant. The couple got engaged but ultimately separated before Bella gave birth to a girl, Stevie. Stevie proved to have medical problems and was helped through it by surgeon Boyd Rolleston (Sam Bunkall), making Bella realise she had fallen in love with him. Following the devastating death of Bella's mother Wendy (Jacqueline Nairn), Bella and Boyd finally committed to a relationship. The relationship proved successful but after many months came under strain due to the data-based Boyd became frustrated with Bella's belief in the supernatural. Realising the two were too different, they separated and Bella found herself drawn to temporary CEO Rajiv Prasad (Mel Odedra) whom shared her feelings of grief from Wendy's death, as he had lost his young daughter years beforehand. After Bella accidentally lost Stevie briefly, Rajiv helped her realise the importance of her child's safety and she decided to leave Ferndale to be closer to Jimmy in Raglan. In late 2019 Boyd was shocked when Bella revealed herself as the Managing Director of a spiritual healing company selling sessions to Shortland Street patients. Reconnecting over their different perspectives of science, the two reconciled and Boyd happily became a father figure to Stevie. However Bella quickly realised Boyd was truly in love with Zara Mandal (Nivi Summer). She departed as the year ended, offering Boyd an ultimatum between the two women. Boyd's best friend Drew McCaskill (Ben Barrington) later informed Bella over the phone that Boyd had chosen Zara. Character development =Characterisation= In describing Bella, Reid stated, \\"Bella's vivacious, fun and has a kind heart. Sometimes though, her eagerness to relate to people means she rubs them up the wrong way. Bella's personality brings life to the room,\\" She hoped they shared little characteristics, \\"I hope I'm not too much like Bella, she has a heart of gold though,\\" but admitted to several, \\"We both suffer foot-in-mouth disease. We are both partial to wearing too many things at once, and we both love people.\\" One reviewer referred to Bella as, \\"ditzy, but warmhearted.\\" Hugh Sundae of The New Zealand Herald, compared Bella to past character, Gina Rossi-Dodds (Josephine Davison), stating that Bella was, \\"Forever alternating between dropping clangers and joining the dots. It's like Gina (remember her?) got taller and dyed her hair. And started joining dots.\\" =Relationship with Luke Durville= In 2011 oddball anaesthetist, Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) returned to the show with a fianc√©, Zlata Waldheim (Kate Elliott). The staff soon realised that Zlata was manipulating Luke to drastically change him as a person, none more so than Luke's best friend, Bella. Bella soon realised she was in love with Luke and was disorientated when Zlata placed her at the centre of the wedding organisation. Luke soon realised he too was in love with Bella and put an end to his and Zlata's engagement. In 2012 through the manipulation of Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen), the two separated, but quickly reconciled. When Bella began to tire of her lifestyle, Luke decided to get her involved in art with Urquhart stating, \\"Luke feels genuinely concerned when Bella is worried her life isn't exciting enough. He likes to see her happy and is determined to cheer her up ... Luke is over the moon when he thinks he has the answer to Bella's problems. Art is also a love that they share and can bond over.\\" The couple got engaged and Bella soon became a \\"bridezilla\\". Bella ended up winning a competition that would see their wedding paid for, Reid explained, \\"She was very excited about it. Luke, not so much ‚Äì the idea of having to have photographs and making it so public. He's definitely pleasing her and going along with this big dream fairytale wedding. He'd much prefer, I think, to just have family and a quiet ceremony but she's planning this wedding since she was about 5 years old so she's going a bit crazy.\\" Urquhart agreed, stating that Luke's perfect wedding, \\"would have some kind of ritual from somewhere but the main focus for Luke would be that him and his bride were there and he'd be happy .... he deals with her as he always has ‚Äì with love and servitude.\\" On the night prior to the wedding, Luke was diagnosed with Glioblastoma multiforme and emotionally admitted to Bella she should reconsider marrying a dying man. Nonetheless, Bella decided to carry on with the nuptials and the two married in December 2012. The wedding march used for the episode was the same as the music used for the 1981 wedding between Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales. Although happily married, Bella struggled to accept Luke's diagnosis and suggested she have his child to keep his legacy alive. Luke was hesitant to accept the offer and instead, the couple threw a \\"living wake\\", a party themed around that of a wake set to celebrate Luke's life. Reid elaborated on Bella's desire to have the party, \\"Bella thinks this is a perfect opportunity for people to show their appreciation of Luke and his life. But she wants to keep it as cheerful as possible.\\" As such she struggled with the theme of death. Several months after Luke's death, Zala returned to Ferndale with a baby, Luke's apparent son, Luca Dobra (Charlie Truman). Bella embraced Luca, with Reid explaining, \\"she realises that Luca is definitely Luke's baby, it really hits her hard. But it doesn't take her long to realise that having Luca around is like having a little piece of Luke in her life and she embraces being part of his upbringing.\\" Reception Hugh Sundae of The New Zealand Herald praised Reid's portrayal of Bella, stating; \\"Amelia Reid (as Bella Cooper) wasn't firing at 100 percent in her first week either, but now she's one of The Street's best new characters\\". Michael Galvin (Chris Warner) named Bella as one of his favourite characters and commented that Reid played her \\"to perfection\\".  Relations to future characters  Shadon Meredith, husband of Amelia, played as HIV-carrier Matiu, and a homosexual love interest to Jack Hannah in 2019.

London Church of England Births and Baptisms, 1813-1917 for Ethel Barns Page 30 of 215 London Metropolitan Archives via Ancestry ‚Äì 31 December 1948) was an English violinist, pianist and composer. She was born in London and entered the Royal Academy of Music at as a teenager, where she studied with Emile Sauret for violin, Ebenezer Prout for composition and Frederick Westlake for piano. An image of Ethel Barns found in the weekly publication, the Bystander, in 1907 Barns made her debut as a violinist at The Crystal Palace in London in 1896, and toured in England and the United States. While on tour, Barns sometimes accompanied prominent opera singer, Adelina Patti. Barns was a member of the first council of the Society of Women Musicians, which was founded in 1911.Sophie Fuller, \\"Ethel Barns,\\" In The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell, 2nd edition, Vol. 2: 745‚Äì746, London: Macmillan Press Limited, 2001. Barns became a professor at the Royal Academy of Music and died in Maidenhead on 31 December 1948. Early life and career Barns was born in London in the year 1874 (some sources inaccurately list 1880 as her birth year). In 1887, at the age of thirteen, Barns enrolled in the Royal Academy of Music and began taking violin lessons with Emile Sauret. Barns also took up lessons with Frederick Westlake for piano and Ebenezer Prout for composition.Nigel Burton, \\"Ethel Barns,\\" In The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers, edited by Julie Anne Sadie and Rhian Samuel: 36‚Äì37, New York: W.W. Norton and Company Incorporated, 1994.Aaron I. Cohen, ‚ÄúBarns, Ethel,‚Äù In The International Encyclopedia of Women Composers, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1: 55, New York: Books & Music Inc., 1987. One of her earliest public performances took place in 1890 at the Royal Academy's St. James's Hall in a concert that featured her playing two movements from Louis Spohr's violin concerto. In 1891, she sang and performed the violin at Cadogan Gardens. That same year, she published one of her earliest works, Romance, a piece for violin and piano. After her graduation in 1895, Barns became a substitute teacher at the Royal Academy of Music and remained a student of Emile. At this point in Barns‚Äô early career, she had proved herself a ‚Äúversatile musician‚Äù by serving as a regular violinist having played pieces by Gabriel Faur√© and Martin Sarasaten and performing works such as Beethoven piano concerto. Barns was well sought-after and performed hers and others works in concert halls across London, including the Crystal Palace in 1896. She was also beginning to publish her compositions, many of which she premiered, through the publisher Stanley Lucas. These early publications included works for violin, piano, and voice, such as \\"A Fancy\\" and \\"Waiting for Thee.\\" Late career Barns married Charles Phillips, a performing baritone, in 1899, having met him eight years earlier at one of her concerts. She kept her both name and career, which was not unusual for professional women of the time. The pair founded the Barns- Phillips Chamber Concert Series at Bechstein Hall, which was designed to help promote Barns' compositions. After her 1900 performance of her Violin Sonata No. 1 in D Minor (which went unpublished) at Steinway Hall, a reviewer compared hers to the works of Edvard Grieg, Anton Rubinstein, and Johannes Brahms. Barns' Violin Concerto in A Major was published by Schott, in the same year in which she premiered it at a 1904 Barns-Phillips concert. Barns expert, Sophie Fuller, described the work has a \\"typically tempestuous and lyrical work with rich, sonorous piano harmonies and a difficult but always violinistic solo part.\\" Other performers also took Barn's compositions to the stage, including Joseph Joachim, who played her Second Sonata as well as her Violin Concerto, and her teacher, Emile Sauret, who performed the Barns Fantasy. Other pieces performed as a part of Barns-Phillips series included her Piano Trio in F Minor and her Third Violin Sonata in 1908. The latter marked Barn's return to the stage having recovered from a serious illness. 1908 also saw the premier of Barns' Suite for Violin and Piano, performed by one of her publishers, Schott. In 1909, her work for violin and orchestra, Concert√ºck, premiered at the Queen's Hall Promenade Concerts Schott saw that this work was published as a piano arrangement a year later. Between the years of 1907 and 1928, Schott published at least 35 works composed by Barns, including Chant Elegiaque (1907), Hindoo Lament (1907), Idylle Pastorale (1909), and even Eight Pieces (1910), the collection for education use. Schott then published Barns' Violin Sonata No. 4 in G Minor, Op. 24 in 1911, which had been premiered by Barns the previous year, again at a Barns-Phillips concert. 1911 was also the year in which W. W. Cobbett commissioned Barns on behalf of the Musician's Company. This piece was Fantasy Trio for Two Violins and Piano, which Barns debuted alongside her teacher, Sauret. Barns continued composing, publishing, and performing into the late 1920s. In 1927, she performed the Fifth Violin Sonata. A year later, she published three more pieces for violin and piano.

The park is bordered by 8th Avenue on the west, Horatio Street on the south, and Greenwich Avenue on the east. The park interrupts West 13th Street. Its triangular shape arose from the intersection of two Native American footpaths that grew into Greenwich Village streets.‚ÄúIndian paths in the great metropolis,‚Äù Reginald Pelham Bolton, New York Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, 1922. Later, the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 created a new street grid for Manhattan, which ultimately resulted in 8th Avenue being built through the intersection. The triangular area developed from an unimproved public rallying place, to a classic Victorian viewing garden, to a children's playground, and finally a contemporary mixed-use space. Pre-Colonial: Intersection of footpaths Two footpaths would emerge as foundational streets in what is today‚Äôs Meatpacking district and West Village of Manhattan. One footpath led up from the riverbank trading station called ‚ÄúSapohanikan‚Äù and was both largely perpendicular to the shore and aligned closely to the solar equinox of spring and fall. It would become what we today call Gansevoort Street.Hudson River Park Its parallel offspring, Horatio Street, forms the southern border of the park. The other footpath came up from the south and would become what we today call Greenwich Avenue, which forms the east side of the park. Colonial: Evolution of roads By the late 18th century the footpaths had evolved into roads, with connecting roads emerging to the north. The city's first war memorial was erected in 1762 among farmland at the northern terminus of Greenwich Avenue (known then as Monument Lane) a few hundred feet north of what is now Jackson Square Park. It was an obelisk honoring British Major General James Wolfe who died in the Battle of Quebec. By 1773, the monument no longer appeared on local survey maps, though why it was dismantled is unknown.New York City Department of Parks and Recreation: War MemorialsDocuments of the NY State Assembly: Nineteenth Annual Report (1914) of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society 1811‚Äì72: Rallying point On March 22, 1811 the New York State Legislature adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, the visionary but rigid grid system of streets to the north. But the decision to have 8th Avenue continue south below 14th Street appears to have not been implemented until the 1830s.Cornell Anthology of Urban Planning This 8th Avenue extension would become the western side of the park. At the same time, Gansevoort Street was truncated by half a block, therefore no longer intersecting with what is Greenwich Avenue, in an effort to simplify the multitude of intersecting roads. It is not certain when the triangular area was formally named ‚ÄúJackson Square‚Äù but it is referred to as such in local newspapers by the early 1850s.The New York Times Feb 11, 1853 Page 6 It was presumably named for Andrew Jackson, US President from 1829 to 1837, who died in 1845.New York City Department of Parks and Recreation It is not to be confused with the contemporaneously owned private park of the same name at the foot of Jackson Street at the East River.New York World Dec 24, 1893 Page 3 \\"Old Jackson square...was laid out in 1797 as Walnut, but in 1846 it was changed to Jackson. The city has bought the property [1893] and is going to make a park of it -- Corlears Hook Park.‚Äù Until 1872 the area was simply an open intersection of streets, acting occasionally as a gathering place for political and civic rallies of up to 1,000 and even 2,000 people in attendance, often featuring temporarily constructed platforms for speakers. Nighttime illumination came from burning tar barrels, later gas lighting and then eventually electric lighting.The New York Tribune Oct 19, 1858 Page 5The New York Times Dec 01, 1859 Page 4 Certainly by the early 1850s Jackson Square had become a regular location for fireworks and music each 4 July, a tradition which would last for decades.The New York Times Jul 4, 1853 Page 4The New York Times Jul 3, 1861 During the second half of the 19th century, the Jackson Square area was referred to as the ‚ÄúScotch quarter.\\" It was also known for its Irish-born residents from the three northeast counties that are closest to Scotland.The Sun (New York) newspaper Jun 17, 1888 Page 8The New York Irish, by Ronald H Baylor & Timothy J.

In 1873 sidewalks of blue-stone were added around the perimeter of the fenced-in greenery.NYC Parks Commission meeting minutes Sep 10, 1873, Page 255 But the interior was not open to the public, so it could only be enjoyed by viewing it from outside. The New York Tribune reports, ‚ÄúThe children reached through the railings and pulled blades of green seed grass, and on warm nights the neighbors with their babies found seats around the coping where they could catch whiffs of ‚Äòcounty air.‚Äô‚Äù The prevailing view at the time was that small green spaces should be kept closed \\"for the fear of the ravages of the multitudes.\\"‚ÄúThe evolution of a city square.‚Äù By Samuel Parsons, Jr. July, 1892. Scribners Magazine. Vol. XII . Page 107 The fountain in winter After several years of lobbying from the public, in 1887 Mayor Abram Hewitt promoted a citywide effort to improve public access to small parks and squares that were not open to the public.New York Tribune June 23, 1887 page 2 In that year Parks superintendent Samuel Parsons Jr. and consulting architect Calvert Vaux collaborated on a new design for Jackson Square. By August 1888, the City Parks Commissioner officially opened ‚ÄúJackson Park‚Äù after four months of construction. Improvements included a new gateway, an asphalt walk ten feet wide around the interior, 300 feet in length and the circuit of the park, along which seats were placed. A drinking fountain was added. Described in city documents and newspapers only in its initial year as \\"Jackson Park,\\" the name \\"Jackson Square Park\\" took hold by 1889.NYC Parks Commission meeting minutes Sep 5 & Oct 10, 1888 Samuel Parsons later described the design for Jackson Square Park: ‚ÄúWalks‚Ä¶wound around the outskirts along the fence, leaving a border for planting of five or ten feet...[while] the central space was made a great bouquet of brilliant flowers and leaves...the central showy bedding, flanked and nested as it were among masses of trees and shrubs.\\" 20th and 21st centuries Attitudes toward the use of open space in cities changed in the early 20th century with progressive social reformists reshaping parks to more practically and actively address the needs of urban residents, especially children and mothers.The Cultural Landscape Foundation Between 1910 and 1911 the central idea of the park being a classic Victorian ‚Äúviewing‚Äù park was eliminated when its central feature, the large raised \\"showy bedding\\" in the center, was leveled and covered with gravel for use as a playground. Swings and see-saws were erected. A pit was also dug and filled with sand for the children to play in.Department of Parks, City of New York, Park Board Annual Report 1910 & 1911. By 1913, Jackson Square Park was formally participating in what the City called ‚Äúlittle farmers‚Äù program which allowed children to tend to their very own, dedicated small plot in which to grow flowers and vegetables. Started in 1902 in DeWitt Clinton Park by Frances Griscom Parsons, the idea quickly spread across New York City and to some degree nationally until the distraction of World War I.New York City Department of Parks and Recreation Jackson Square Park, view south toward Horatio Street The park underwent renovations in the 1930s‚Äî17 pin oaks were planted on the perimeter, the shower basin was replaced by a new wading pool, and new benches were installed. The park had developed a reputation as park ideal for mothers and children. Installed in 1971, an eight-by-thirteen foot ‚Äúcombination fountain and jungle gym...a water spray for children that also serves as a decorative park fountain‚Äù replaced a three- foot high conventional shower.'The New York Times Aug 24, 1971 Perhaps because of the opening of the larger Bleecker Street Playground in 1966New York City Department of Parks and Recreation there was less of a need for Jackson Square Park to remain a children‚Äôs playground. In 1990 a capital reconstruction project was completed that changed the park to reflect what is seen today. It included planting new greenery and restoring the historic iron fencing and benches. The centerpiece, a new cast-iron fountain with planters and a granite base, evokes the 19th-century origins of Jackson Square Park but is newly constructed.New York City Department of Parks and Recreation Monuments Since 2008, the Jackson Square Alliance, a 510c3 non-profit organization, has helped support maintenance of the park and encouraged its use by the public.Jackson Square Alliance  References   External links  *Jackson Square Alliance Category:Parks in Manhattan Category:Squares in Manhattan Category:Pocket parks Category:Greenwich Village Category:Eighth Avenue (Manhattan) ","title":"Jackson Square Park"},{"id":"30604306","text":"Claim the Throne 2018 Claim the Throne are a melodic death band with strong folk metal influence, from Perth, Western Australia. In 2008 they released their debut album Only the Brave Return that also included a matching fantasy novel written by the band members. 2009 saw the release of their EP Ale Tales through Prime Cuts Music, which also featured a DVD including a music video and behind the scenes footage the Only the Brave Return release party. The music took a change in direction with fast up-beat songs short in length. The track 'Set Sail on Ale' was used for the band's first music video, and was nominated for the WAM Song of the Year in the Heavy category. In June 2010 they embarked on an Australian national tour as the main support for Scottish pirate metal band Alestorm, and in March 2011 they were the main support for Finnish folk metal band Finntroll. They also played local support slots with bands such as Arch Enemy and Suffocation. In December 2010, the second full- length album was released, called Triumph and Beyond. This music style was described as a combination of the first 2 releases, but with far better production, and took the band on further extensive tours of Australia, New Zealand, and a UK tour with Alestorm in 2012. In September 2013, Claim The Throne released their highly regarded Forged In Flame album. With 14 tracks and 70 minute running time, and a music video for the song 'Zephyrus', this album received rave reviews worldwide and the band continued their heavy touring of Australia to support its release, including a tour with fellow Australian melodic death band Belakor. Since then they have performed at a number of festivals, including Hammmersonic, Fanatik, Hell On The Bay, and were the first Australian band to appear on the 70000 Tons of Metal Cruise. They toured through South Korea and Japan with bands such as Catamenia, Dark Lunacy and Mercenary, and in January 2015 they undertook a headlining tour of USA and Canada. Back in Australia, they played local support slots for Cradle Of Filth, Moonsorrow, Fleshgod Apocalypse and Septic Flesh. In 2013 the band started their own podcast, with topics based on DIY musician help and interviewing prominent figures of the music industry. There are already over 50 episodes. Claim The Throne released their fourth full-length album 'On Desolate Plains' in October 2017, and are touring for its release through Australia and Japan.

The Tibet Post Office Dharamsala Introduction TPI's daily online newspaper provides uncensored news to inform and educate readers about Tibet-related issues at home and in exile, which are acknowledged internationally, also reported by the Chinese state media.  Creation  Created on December 10, 2007, in the Tibetan exile community of Dharamsala in the Himalayan region of Northern India, it was the first independent trilingual daily online newspaper-in-exile, publishing in English, Tibetan and Mandarin, and remains the only one in existence. The publication celebrates a readership of nearly 10 million per year from 2017, and maintains a general readership of between 500 and 10,000 online guests at any given time.About Us The initiative of an independent non-profit organisation, Tibet Post focuses on Tibet-related issues, closely following the developments inside Tibet as well as reporting on the activities and workings of the exile community's democratic institutions.  Bi-monthly newspaper  The TPI has launched a fortnightly newspaper. The eight-page broadsheet, containing a wide range of news and features covering events both inside Tibet and the exiled Tibetan world, was launched at the Dalai Lama‚Äôs main temple in McLeod Ganj, on Monday, December 10, 2012, to coincide with International Human Rights Day and Nobel Peace Prize Day of the Dalai Lama of Tibet. However, we anticipate discontinuing the printed version from August 2018.  Circulation  The publication's website is considered a strong force in the Tibetan community and representing people in Tibet and Tibetan people's voice reaching to the outside world, promoting peaceful interaction between Tibetans and Chinese as well as objectivity, making it unique in its traditional regions of Tibet and a free news source that reaches and informs many in the remote community it serves. The Tibet Post publication has been heralded as a strong force in educating Chinese seeking objective viewpoints on the situation in Tibet. According to its website cpanel and Google analysis, an estimated 60% of its readers are thought to be logging on from inside China,Walton, Greg, 'Analysis of Online Freedoms and Firewalls', Reporters Without Borders (RSF), 2010 giving it the largest readership of any Tibetan news source-in-exile, and making it the only one claiming a majority of Chinese readers. Subjects such as human rights, censorship, and the Tibetan cause in China are the driving forces behind the non-profit organisation, 'Himalayan Literacy Trust' (HLT) by whom it was created. The HLT is part of an affiliation which also includes Reporters Without Borders (RSF) the international freedom of press watchdog organisations in and outside of India, with focus on the 'very serious' situation regarding freedom of expression in China and Tibet.Authorities Openly Threaten Those Who Circulate Information with \\"Torture\\"  Mission  TPI‚Äôs mission is to advocate for democracy, peace, justice, political pluralism and rule of law in Tibetan society, and to give voice to the people of the three Tibetan provinces. These goals are guided by the principles of non-violence and compassion. It is an interactive publication, which encourages readers‚Äô comments, phone calls and e-mails, and conducts interviews and opinion polls to promote freedom of expression and dialogue. Over the past two and a half years, TPI has become one of the most popular news websites amongst Tibetan communities in exile and, although it is difficult to access in Tibet, it is recognised as an important news source. HLT and TPI‚Äôs founding members are all scholars who have undergone intensive religious and secular studies under highly accomplished Tibetan teachers. In addition to covering news and political issues, the site includes sections on health, the environment, arts and culture, opinion, and the Tibetan diaspora. Its sister sites also include statistical information and opinion polls. TPI's website features a bi-monthly, downloadable and printable newspaper which features high-profile articles from the website. In 2012, TPI has started to print the newspaper itself and distribute it free of charge to individuals and institutions within the Tibetan diaspora, particularly targeting readers who have limited or no internet access. TPI's services are unique because they originate in the heart of the Tibetan exile community, providing a daily link between the Tibetans in Tibet and the exile community and the rest of the free world. TPI exploits new media tools such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and regularly uploads feature stories, video reports and interviews from its sources- Tibet, exile and abroad.  Investigations  Investigations into China's human rights situation have shown that torture is used routinely in many prisons and interrogations. In 2016 the TPI submitted evidence to the UK Conservative Party Human Rights Commission: Human Rights in China, detailing the record of abuse inside Tibet between 2013-2016. Subsequently the Committee concluded that torture in Tibet is \\"The Darkest Moment: The Crackdown on Human Rights in China, 2013-16. \\". TPI has also worked alongside world leaders and activists such as Henri Malosse-EESC President, Michael Caster-Human rights advocate, researcher, and civil society consultant, Alan Gilbert, a John Evans professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, and Rose Tang-Chinese writer and activist. TPI also closely worked with governments and NGOs such as Reporters Without Borders, The Committee to Protect Journalists, the United States' Congressional- Executive Commission on China and U.S. Department of State, to share its reports of tortured Tibetans inside Tibet. Books published in their chronological order 1) '25 June 2015 : Launching literacy book title: \\"Roar Within Ehythm,\\" a collection of 119 writers and bloggers, 60 of them from inside Tibet (Successful attempt to bridge between bloggers in Tibet and exile) 2) From July 2016; as its close to election days, as mentioned earlier, we began to prepared to publish a new book in Tibetan language title: \\"Focusing the real Subject,\\" and launched on May 20, 2016; a collection of more than 30 interviews with Prime Minister (Sikyong) candidates, top officials from various bodies and NGO leaders, ex-political prisoners and other interest individuals (an attempt to bridge between community leaders and general public). The book is focusing on Tibetan democracy and human rights, particularly on recent Tibetan elections. However only two top officials refused to accept our interview, but we have clearly mentioned in the book editorial and stated why we are regret about their failed response. 3) On 10 December 2015, TPI released a new book titled: \\"Voice of an Exiled Tibetan\\", to mark the 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Dalai Lama's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize and the 66th International Human Rights Day. The book is primarily a compilation of more than 50 analytical articles related to the modern issues facing all Tibetans‚Äîat home and in exile‚Äîand seeks to serve as a response to how Tibet is portrayed by China and other outlets. 4) On 15 February, Deputy Speaker of Tibetan Parliament in Exile Acharya Yeshi Phuntsok launched a book of interviews with exiled Tibetan women writers and their works titled ‚ÄúWomen Who Hold The Pen‚Äù at the Tibet Post International office in Mcleod Ganj. The book comprises the interviews of 33 exiled Tibetan women writers across the world, which included 15 published authors and other enthusiastic readers of Tibetan language.  Headquarters  The Tibet Post office headquarters are located in the district magistrate of Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, India, and is supported by the South Tyrol Regional Parliament, Italy, with contributions also made from Delhi, India, Austria, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. Its Editor-in-Chief is Yeshe Choesang, who is also the founder of HLT, TPI Agency, India; and other editors include Keary Huang (Editor for the Chinese version of TPI, Taipei, Taiwan), Kalsang Dolma (Assistant editor for Tibetan version of the Tibet Post International, India), and James Dunn (was reporter for The Tibet Europe).  Goals and Objectives  In order to achieve its goals, HLT and TPI have identified the following objectives and guiding principles: 1) To provide a fair and accurate news service which covers the political and social situation in Tibet, and to promote its access internationally, including to Tibetan people living in China 2) To inform and engage members of the Tibetan diaspora and others, especially English-speaking foreigners, about social issues affecting Tibetan communities in exile 3) To promote through its publications the principles of democracy, freedom of expression, social justice, political and legislative debate, political pluralism, women‚Äôs rights, rule of law, public empowerment, peace, non- violence and peaceful conflict resolution 4) To encourage and support the needs of Tibetan journalists living in exile, through professional development 5) To promote and encourage greater knowledge among Tibetan journalists about the democratic government-in-exile and social, political, health and environmental issues 6) To employ a multicultural, multilingual editorial staff, including volunteers from around the world, and encourage discussion and debate from different perspectives on issues related to Tibet and Tibetans 7) To support English-language acquisition and awareness of current events amongst Tibetan youths living in exile, in both schools and the wider community 8) To maintain our unique role as a provider of wide, in-depth and up-to-the-minute coverage of Tibet-related news and current affairs 9) To contribute to the nurturing of a strong Tibetan society by promoting support for the Tibetan cause both internationally and within Tibet.

Life Maria del Carmen P√©rez Jim√©nez was born in Montevideo, the daughter of Spanish residents Santos Rojas and still life painter Antonio P√©rez Gim√©nez Barradas. She first studied with Antonio Frank, but ended the study after her father died in 1898. With support from friends and family, she later continued with Aurora Pablo and M. Lopes Vicente at the Conservatorio del Uruguay, receiving her diploma in 1915. Following the example of her younger brother, the painter Rafael Barradas, she adopted the stage name Carmen Barradas. Her youngest brother was writer and poet Antonio De Ignacios. After World War I, Rafael Barradas found he was unable to return from Spain to Uruguay, so in 1916 Barradas' family moved to Spain. The family struggled to get there, having to apply for entry as laborers. Once in Spain, Carmen and her mother supported themselves by making toys. However, Carmen also developed as a composer and actively participated in the artistic life of Barcelona. In 1917 she gave a concert of her own works. Barradas lived and composed in Spain until 1922, then returned with her family to Montevideo in 1928, where she took a position teaching at the Institutos Normales. During this period, she published a magazine for children called Andresillo which included cartoons and songs. Her works pioneered the use of non-traditional graphic notation and experimental techniques. Barradas produced her own works at the Teatro Sol√≠s in 1934 and ended her composing career in 1949. She died in Montevideo. Although her works were described as \\"brilliant,\\" her experimental direction was not well received in Uruguay during her lifetime. Many of her works were lost at her death. However, pianist and musicologist N√©ffer Kr√∂ger retained and interpreted some of the scores. About 170 partial and complete manuscripts are left.

This is a type of studio apartment or studio flat. An officetel is designed to be a partially self-contained building, such that its occupants can live and work in the same building, minimizing commute time. Because of the convenience of having daily routines located in one building, a significant proportion of the officetel's inhabitants include lawyers, accountants, tax accountants, professors, and artists. Office space is usually parceled out or leased to trading companies and small- to medium-sized businesses. Officetels are mainly found downtown or around major transportation hubs. As the scale of construction grows over time, officetels tend to offer more commercial and housing features through amenities like sports centers and shopping facilities. After the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the construction of officetels has increased rapidly due to governmental deregulations, and they are now taking a substantial portion of the housing market in the Seoul Metropolitan Area.Lee SangYoung, Kim ByungUk 2002 \\"Ïò§ÌîºÏä§ÌÖî ÏãúÏû•Î∂ÑÏÑùÍ≥º ÏàòÏùµÎ•† Ï∂îÏ†ï\\" Í∞êÏ†ïÌèâÍ∞ÄÏó∞Íµ¨ 12(2), pp.91-108. Features Officetel parcels are commonly 50 to 100 m¬≤ in size. Most officetel residential spaces are a studio apartment with bathroom, kitchen, and bed areas. Basic furnishings are usually included with an officetel lease. It is currently illegal to have an Ondol tub or balcony heating systems in an officetel. History The first officetel was built in Mapo, Seoul by the Korea Development Corporation in 1985.Morris, Joe. Lovenests: Newlyweds of the Asian Tigers. HarperCollins, New York, 1996. p. 77.

The rocket proved an operational success, and spawned several improved versions for use against surface and land targets. Design and development Following trials by the Royal Air Force of rocket-propelled, air-launched weapons for anti-submarine warfare during 1942, the United States Navy launched a high-priority project during the summer of 1943 for the development of an anti-submarine rocket of its own.Parsch 2004 The resulting rocket was a simple design with four tail fins for stabilization at the rear, powered by a rocket motor that had been under development by Caltech since 1943.von Braun and Ordway 1975, p.98. The warhead contained no explosive. The rocket's nose was a solid steel mass, weighing , that punctured the pressure hull of a target submarine through the kinetic energy and momentum from its high velocity and mass.Campbell 1985, p.170. The nose of the 3.5\\" FFAR was given a relatively blunt conical shape that had been shown experimentally to give a maximum pitch-up of the nose as the rocket entered the water. This caused the rocket to shoot forward at a shallow depth deadly to submarines that were surfaced or traveling at snorkel or periscope depth.C. W. Snyder, Caltech's Other Rocket Project: Personal Recollections, pp. 7-10, Engineering & Science, Spring 1991 The rockets were launched in a shallow dive, since entry into the water at too steep an angle would defeat their ability to shoot forward at the required shallow depth. The rocket remained lethal even after passing through up to 130 feet of water, giving the pilot a target several times the actual size of the submarine. The sweet spot for targeting was considered to be 60 feet in front of the near side of the submarine. Typical firing range was about 1500 yards.E.W. Price, C.L. Horine, and C.W. Snyder (July 1998). \\"EATON CANYON, A History of Rocket Motor Research and Development in the Caltech-NDRC-Navy Rocket Program, 1941-1946,\\". 34th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, Cleveland, Ohio. AIAA. Operational history Following expedited development, the weapon, officially designated the 3.5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket, entered operational service with the U.S. Navy late in 1943; production of 10,000 rockets per month had been ordered that August.Friedman 1982, p.198. The FFAR's first \\"kill\\" of an enemy submarine took place 11 January 1944. The rocket was originally carried by the Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber. Excessive drag caused by the original 92\\" long channel-slide launchers was largely eliminated with the introduction of zero length launchers in May 1945. Zero length launchers quickly became standard on most fighters and many light bombers for firing a variety of rockets with 3.25\\" or 5\\" diameter rocket motors. Although the rocket's accuracy was more than sufficient to allow usage against surface targets, the narrow body diameter restricted the size of any explosive warhead that could be fitted. Therefore, for use against ships and land targets, the rocket was given a warhead consisting of a 45 lb re-fused 5\\" Mark 35 artillery shell, producing the 5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket, usually shortened to 5\\" AR.Parsch 2006 See also * High Velocity Aircraft Rocket * Zuni rocket * List of rockets References ;Citations ;Bibliography  External links Category:Anti-submarine missiles of the United States Category:World War II weapons of the United States ","title":"3.5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket"},{"id":"30604678","text":"Miriam Marececk is an educational consultant and author specializing in the field of children's literature.
