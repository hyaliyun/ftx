It is a bildungsroman, and concerns a college freshman, Selin, attending Harvard University in the 1990s. Plot Selin Karadaƒü is a freshman studying linguistics at Harvard University. She meets an older Hungarian mathematics student, Ivan, in a Russian language class and the two begin corresponding over email, and occasionally spend time together in person. While Selin and Ivan at times seem interested in each other romantically, neither know how and when to express their feelings. The summer after her freshman year, Selin travels to Paris with her college friend Svetlana, and then to Hungary to teach English in a remote village, a job she accepts partly to be closer to Ivan. At the end of the summer, Selin returns to Harvard and Ivan goes to California to pursue graduate mathematics. Reception The Idiot was a 2018 Pulitzer Prize Finalist in Fiction. According to the literary review aggregator LitHub, the novel received mostly positive reviews. Writing for The New York Times, Dwight Garner describes how \\"Each paragraph is a small anthology of well-made observations.\\" Though, Garner ultimately describes, the protagonist, Selin, as \\"an interesting human who, very much like this wry but distant novel, never becomes an enveloping one.\\" Conversely, Annalisa Quinn of NPR asserts that \\"The Idiot encapsulates those years of humiliating, but vibrant, confusion the come in your late teens, a confusion that's not even sexual, but existential and practical\\". Quinn concludes by noting that, \\"The Idiot is both boring and strangely intense, fraught and apparently meaningless, confusing and inevitable, endless ‚Äî and over in a moment.\\" Vox gave the novel 3.5 stars out of 5, with reviewer Constance Grady noting that \\"the atmosphere at the heart of The Idiot is one of linguistic alienation, when the distance between what words say and what they mean seems insurmountable.\\" Grady further describes how \\"the heartbreak that ensues is slightly melancholy, but it‚Äôs not overwhelming: The Idiot doesn‚Äôt bring you in close enough for that. It keeps you far enough away that you have to pay more attention to its words than to the emotions that they‚Äôre describing.\\" References 2017 American novels Campus novels American bildungsromans Novels set in the 1990s Novels set in Boston ","title":"The Idiot (Batuman novel)"},{"id":"53736177","text":"Enathu Bailey bridge was a Bailey bridge constructed by Indian Army through Kallada River in Enathu, Pathanamthitta, Kerala.

Until the middle of the 19th century, a half-timbered house also known as The Old Angel, existed at the junction of High Pavement and St Mary‚Äôs Gate. Originally 2 houses, the current public house building dates from around 1800. In 1878, the landlord W Robinson employed Lawrence Bright to make alterations, and 5 years later, in 1883, the landlord J Robinson made further alterations under the architect H Walker. In 1911, Horace Shears, cellarman, pleaded guilty to stealing five bottles of whisky, two bottles of gin, one bottle of sherry, and some towels and handkerchiefs to the value of ¬£3 (). He was sent to prison for 2 months. In the 1980s the pub developed a reputation as a rock and roll venue, with the old chapel on the 1st floor converted into a performance area.

Flower constellations The original theory of Flower Constellations has been proposed in 2004 . Then, the theory has evolved, moving to the 2-D Lattice theory , to the 3-D lattice theory, and recently, to the Necklace theory. These constellations are particularly suitable for classic applications, such as space-based navigation systems (e.g., GPS and Galileo), Earth observation systems (global, regional, persistent, uniform, weighted), and communication systems. Some more advanced and futuristic applications, such as Hyland's intensity correlation interferometric system, configurations to provide global internet broadband service from space, and solar system communication networks, are currently studied. K-vector Range Searching Technique The K-vector Range Searching Technique is a range searching technique that can be applied to fast retrieve data from any static database. The k-vector technique was initially proposed to identify stars observed by star trackers on board spacecrafts. Then, it has been applied to solve different kinds of problems belonging to different fields, such as: 1) nonlinear functions inversion and intersection, 2) extensive sampling data generation with assigned analytical (or numerical) distribution, 4) find approximate solutions of nonlinear Diophantine equations, and 4) iso-surface identification for 3-dimensional data distributions and level set analysis. Theory of Functional Connections The Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) is a mathematical framework generalizing interpolation. TFC derives analytical functionals representing all possible functions subject to a set of constraints. These functionals restrict the whole space of functions to just the subspace that fully satisfies the constraints. Using these functionals, constrained optimization problems are transformed into unconstrained problems. Then, already available and optimized solution methods can be used. The TFC theory has been developed for multivariate rectangular domains subject to absolute, integral, relative, and linear combinations of constraints . Numerically efficient applications of TFC have already been implemented in optimization problems, especially in solving differential equations . In this area, TFC has uniÔ¨Åed initial, boundary, and multi-value problems by providing fast solutions at machine-error accuracy. This approach has already been applied to solve, in real-time, direct optimal control problems, such as autonomous landing on a large planetary body . Additional applications of TFC are found in nonlinear programming and calculus of variations , in Radiative Transfer , Compartmental models in epidemiology , and in Machine learning , where orders of magnitude improvements in speed and accuracy are obtained thanks to the search-space restriction enabled by TFC.

The batteries have a predicted lifespan of 125,000 miles (200,000 km) before reaching a charging capacity of 80% but can still be used after this point with a reduced range. The Urban S can be charged fully using either 220 V for 4 hours or 110 V for 8 hours.  Licence Class  The Urban S comes under the 125cc classification in Europe so can therefore be ridden on an A1 licence or a CBT in the UK  Drivetrain  It uses a 400A DC wave controller with regenerative braking to increase efficiency. The electric motor is a 19 kW 17\\" high output hub motor. It is air cooled and brushless.

In 1892 Fulmen opened its first factory in Clichy. During the following years Fulmen opened other plants all across France (Vierzon, Nanterre, Auxerre, N√Æmes, Chasseneuil and Poitiers). In 1894, the first automotive fiacre created by Louis Kreiger used a Fulmen battery located between the two front wheels. Four years later, Fulmen batteries equipped the Narval submarine. = Globalization = Fulmen logo in the 1970s 1924: The CGE (Compagnie G√©n√©rale √©lectrique) bought Fulmen France. 1925: Fulmen battery sales in Belgium led the company to create 'La soci√©t√© Belge de l‚Äôaccumulateur Fulmen' (The Belgian society of Fulmen accumulator). 1974: The merge between Fulmen France and the CGE becomes the CEAC. 1982: Merging of the commercial networks between Fulmen/Tudor/Dinin. 1989: Repurchase of the rights of use of the Fulmen brand in Belgium by the CEAC. Fulmen brand is now part of Exide Technologies since they bought the CEAC in 1993.  Performance  La Jamais Contente In 1895, the double pha√©ton Jeantaud took part in the Paris- Bordeaux race by changing its Fulmen battery each 40 Kilometers at every relay. In 1899, \\"La Jamais Contente\\" electric car was the first car in the world which exceeds 100 km/h (62 mph) It was equipped with a Fulmen battery. In 1906, one of the Fulmen battery established a world record without recharge. It travelled 307 km between Paris and Ch√¢tellerault.  Others  Fulmen proposed many services: *A quarterly newspaper which provided information for specialists. It had advice, technical documentation and news about Fulmen and the battery market. The newspapers was free on demand. *Fulmen-service: equipment department which provided machines to optimize the control, maintenance, recharge and repair of Fulmen batteries. *Fulmen agency: Fulman gave panels to independent electricians.

During the Moorish period of settlement, the site was occupied by Muslim settlers. During the 20th century (1990s), Manuel Calado held the first archeological excavations in the area to study the settlement. Architecture The old castle is situated in an isolated, rural area delimited by the Rio Lucefecit and smaller affluent, overlooking the territory of high hilltops and eastern flanks. Access to the site is only possible from the western edge. Implanted near a settlement is another settlement designated \\"Castelo Velho 2\\", with common characteristics, while from the site is the Santu√°rio de Endov√©lico em S√£o Miguel da Mota. The fortified settlement has an irregular plan, utilized and modified in different periods. Around its perimeter is a slope with visible vestiges of low walls. These defensive structures have distinct plans corresponding to different phases at the site. The vestiges of structures constructed in the irregular perimeter walls, with the larger structures located near the east and south. Along the northern flank, is a small, irregular gallery related to the probable mining or possible ritual space. The gallery is known as the Casa da Moura (House of the Female Moor), which could have a parallel with the ethnographic sanctuaries that existed in the region, such as in Pego da Moura or Pego da Rocha da Moura (properly attributed to similar enchanted Moors).In the settlement of Mesa dos Castelinho (in Almod√¥var there was a similar situation: they discovered an artificial gallery, that was properly attributed to the same circumstances. Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos also related that Castelo Velho and Castelinho shared similar structures, along the Santu√°rio de Endov√©lico (Endov√©lico Sanctuary) in S√£o Miguel da Mota, roughly away. The defensibility of the settlement was secured by its location in an elevated position, protected by the river and its inclined eastern and western margins. In the west, is a narrow road that permits the unique access to the site. Close to this is the principal entrance to the settlement is a schist platform, where there are visible ceramics, foundry slag and remnants of structures that could correspond to an area of marginal habitation related to metallurgical activities.

Hennessy, and fellow students, Thomas Gross, Steve Przybylski, Norman Jouppi and others, eventually led to the founding of MIPS in 1984. At MIPS he worked on the MIPS instruction set, design tools, and verification of the MIPS R2000 and R3000 processors. He also led development of several generation of small UNIX workstations and servers and eventually led microprocessor research as Vice President of Microprocessor Design during the development of MIPS R4000, R4200 and R10000 processors. MIPS was acquired by Silicon Graphics Inc. in 1992, where Rowen served as Director of Core Technologies for Europe, based in Neucahtel Switzerland. After returning from Switzerland in 1996, he worked for one year as vice president and general manager of design reuse for Synopsys, Inc. before leaving to focus on new ideas on for processors designs. He founded Tensilica in July 1997, and soon teamed up with Bernie Rosenthal and Harvey Jones, to develop the idea of automatic creation of application-specific instruction set processors as licensable designs with complementary software development environments. Other senior founders included Beatrice Fu, Keith Van Sickle, Monica Lam, Earl Killian, Rene Haas and Dror Maydan. Rowen served as CEO of Tensilica until 2008, and then as CTO until Tensilica acquisition by Cadence Design Systems Inc. At Cadence, Rowen was CTO for the Intellectual Property Group. Rowen shifted his focus back to entrepreneurship starting in 2016, calling his investment effort Cognite Ventures, LLC, an effort to invest in, advise and analyze start-ups in the deep learning domain. He also served as senior advisor to the SystemX Alliance industrial affiliates program at Stanford University for 2017. In October 2017, he cofounded BabbleLabs, Inc, a startup applying deep learning methods to speech processing.  Research  Rowen's research work at Stanford included participating in design of the first MIPS processor, the development of optimizing RISC compilers and creation of an early logic synthesis and layout system, for his PhD dissertation: SWAMI: A Flexible Logic Implementation System. He has written numerous articles on microprocessor architecture, system-on-chip design and design using application-specific processors. Rowen's book, _Engineering the Complex SoC_ was published in 2004.

Career Fari√±as was elected as City Mayor of Laoag in the election of January 30, 1980 at the age of 28 making him one of the youngest elected city mayors in the Philippines. During his administration, Laoag City underwent an infrastructural face-lift as more projects were implemented. The city government was also administered more closely which resulted in an increase in its revenues. Fari√±as' prominence increased in the national scene after the 1986 People Power Revolution when the people of Laoag rallied to reject any efforts by the government to replace him as the city mayor. Rudy was elected in as provincial governor of Ilocos Norte in the 1988 local election where he won in a landslide victory. He was elected again in 1992 and 1995 serving for ten consecutive years. During his term, Fari√±as held various posts and chairmanships like national president of JAYCEES, regional chairman of Ilocos Region Peace and Order Council (RPOC) and Reserve Officer‚Äôs League of the Philippines (ROLP). He also received various awards and commendations, most important of which were the Most Outstanding Provincial Governor, 1988 and Most Outstanding Governor Award of the Year, 1996. Fari√±as actively participated in rescue operations when calamities battered the province.

He was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016 for application of artificial intelligence in control of power electronics systems.  Early life and career  Simoes was born in S√£o Paulo (Brazil) in 1963, to Jos√© L.G. Sim√µes and Cec√≠lia A.B.G. Sim√µes, with a sister, Maysa A.G. Sim√µes. When he was 11 years old, he had a strong motivation and decided to become an electrical engineer after his cousin, H√©lio Adauto de Paula, showed him working vacuum tube radios, transistorized audio amplifiers, and also took Simoes to visit his work as an electrical machine designer in Equacional, a motor manufacturing company in the city of S√£o Paulo. Simoes was enrolled in an evening catholic high school from 1978 to 1980, \\"Liceu Cora√ß√£o de Jesus\\", where he learned electronics as part of a technician training. At that time, there was a large job market for electronic technicians in Brazil, but he wanted to study further, in order to be an engineer. Therefore, in 1980, Simoes took the entrance exams (FUVEST) for the University of S√£o Paulo (USP) and was admitted as a student in \\"Escola Polit√©cnica da Universidade de S√£o Paulo (EPUSP). He was a student at EPUSP from 1981 to 1985. In 1982 he was admitted to the Electrical Engineering department of EPUSP and also started an internship at FTDE-Funda√ß√£o para o Desenvolvimento Tecnol√≥gico da Engenharia. From 1984 to 1985, he focused his expertise in telecommunications, antennas, high frequency, analog, and digital circuits design. His Senior Design in 1985 was a modem with analog and circuit implemented for interfacing an 8085 microprocessor, operating on regular telephone connection. Such a system was made before the age of computers connected on telephone lines via modems, that happened several years later. During his four years internship for FDTE, he was learning with senior engineers how to design DC-DC converters and off-line switching mode power supplies, using Phillips manuals for TV flyback circuits and National Instruments handbooks, those power converters were built and implemented in railroad automation (FEPASA), as well as in the S√£o Paulo Metro subway system. In 1985, Simoes graduated from EPUSP and took a job as an engineer for a few years with FDTE. He got inspired by several faculty from EPUSP, for example, Prof. who taught him all modern computer-based electrical and electronics circuits analysis (that time with mainframes, and later on MAC's and PC's), Jos√© Roberto Cardoso who taught electrical machines and energy conversion, Simoes also learned a lot from Prof. Edson Benedicto Ramos Feris and Prof. Guido Stolfi Benedito F√©ris Benedito F√©ris techniques for analog high-frequency circuit designer. During the Senior year (1985) Simoes took a class with as well as Prof. Waldir P√≥ about introduction to Power Electronics, where the principles of utilizing thyristors, diodes, and transitors, to control electrical circuits for energy conversion was a transformation in how Simoes wanted to further pursue his career, making a strong motivation to learn and understand power electronics for controlling machines, ac-dc, dc-ac, and dc-dc power conversion. From 1986 to 1989, Simoes worked for FDTE, at the same time leading technical research with three other partners who together started a company, Antares Eletr√¥nica. Sim√µes completed his M.Sc. degree under the advice of professor Moacyr Martucci Jr. During his Master degree, Simoes started to heavily use computer-based design, initially with MicroCap for PC's, applying Pascal and C languages with compilers made for PC's, then also adopting Matlab in 1988 when it became available for the IBM PC 286 with a co-processor 287. Sim√µes studied most of papers in modeling and simulation of dc/dc converters published by R. D. Middlebrook and Slobodan ƒÜuk. Sim√µes joined EPUSP in 1989 as an instructor in the newly formed Mechatronics group inside the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and finished his Master's degree in 1990. After meeting Prof.Ivo Barbi in 1989, during an event organized at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, the II SEP‚ÄìSemin√°rio de Eletr√¥nica de Pot√™ncia, Prof.Barbi motivated Simoes to study Prof.Bimal Kumar Bose's papers. Simoes then realized that power electronics was a bigger picture. Simoes invited Prof. B.K.Bose to come to Brazil in 1990 to give a 3-day mini-course, and about 40 people attended this mini-course, from local schools in S√£o Paulo, senior engineers from industry, several faculty members from other schools and other states, the meeting was a success, and Sim√µes became very enthusiastic about joining the research group of Prof. Bose. In August 1991, Simoes was admitted as a Ph.D. student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, supported by a Brazilian scholarship from CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento e Pesquisa), with a leave of absence from EPUSP. He was a graduate student in the Electrical Engineering Department of UTK, working under the advice of Prof.Bimal K.Bose, from 1991 to 1995. Simoes conducted research at the facilities of EPRI/PEAC (Power Electronics Applications Center) where Prof.Bimal K.Bose had his research program. Simoes studied all graduate courses available in the UTK graduate program in power electronics, power systems, control systems, and artificial intelligence, mainly learning fuzzy logic and neural networks, in order to apply into his Ph.D. dissertation. After obtaining his Ph.D. in 1995, Sim√µes returned to Brazil to teach at the Mechatronics Department of University of S√£o Paulo. Simoes was promoted from Assistant to Associate Professor after he obtained his Livre-Doc√™ncia Diploma in 1998 (similar to a Doctor of Science degree). Simoes decided to immigrate and continue his career in the USA. He moved to Lakewood, Colorado, in order to accept a faculty position with the Colorado School of Mines in April 2000.  Academic life and career  Sim√µes received a B.Sc. degree from University of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, an M.Sc. degree from University of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, and a Ph.D. degree from The University of Tennessee, USA in 1985, 1990 and 1995 respectively.

Vermont was the first state to enact this Law through legislative action; it permits some terminally ill patients to determine the time of their own death. The measure was passed by both House and Senate and signed into law by Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin on May 8, 2013. The law Under the law, a competent adult Vermont resident who has been diagnosed, by a physician, with a terminal illness that will kill the patient within six months, may request in writing, from his or her physician, a prescription for a lethal dose of medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life. Exercise of the option under this law is voluntary and the patient must initiate the request. A patient who obtains a prescription for the intended purpose of hastening death may change his or her mind at any time. Any physician, pharmacist or healthcare provider who has moral objections may refuse to participate. The request must be confirmed by two witnesses, at least one of whom is not related to the patient, is not entitled to any portion of the patient's estate, is not the patient's physician, and is not employed by a healthcare facility caring for the patient. The prescribing physician must refer the patient to a second physician for medical confirmation of the diagnosis, prognosis, and a determination that the patient is capable, is acting voluntarily, and is making an informed decision. After the request is made, another physician must examine the patient's medical records and confirm the diagnosis. The patient must be determined to be free of a mental condition impairing judgment. If the request is authorized, the patient must wait at least fifteen days and make a second oral request before the prescription may be written. The patient has a right to rescind the request at any time. Should either physician have concerns about the patient's ability to make an informed decision, or feel the patient's request may be motivated by depression or coercion, the patient must be referred for a psychological evaluation. The law protects doctors from liability for providing a lethal prescription for a terminally ill, competent adult in compliance with the statute's restrictions. Participation by physicians, pharmacists and health care providers is voluntary.  The process  A physician may prescribe medication to a terminally ill adult patient that will be self-administered for the purpose of hastening the patient's death. In order to comply with Vermont law, the physician must: * Determine that the patient is suffering from a terminal condition, with a life expectancy of 6 months or fewer, based on the physician's physical examination of the patient and review of the patient's relevant medical records. * Determine that the patient is capable of making a health care decision. * Determine that the patient is making an informed decision. * Determine that the patient is a Vermont resident. * Determine that the patient is making a voluntary request for medication to hasten his or her death. * Determine that the patient is able to self-administer the medication requested to hasten death. * Inform the patient in person, both verbally and in writing of: # the medical diagnosis consisting of the prognosis, including an acknowledgment that this is a prediction of life expectancy and an estimate based on the physician's best medical judgment; that this is not a guarantee of the actual time remaining in the patient's life and that the patient could live longer than the time predicted; # provide the range of treatment options appropriate for the patient's diagnosis; # if the patient is not enrolled in hospice care, all feasible end-of-life services, including palliative care, comfort care, hospice care and pain control; # the range of possible results, including potential risks associated with taking the prescribed medication; # The probable result of taking the prescribed medication. * Refer the patient to a second physician for medical confirmation of the diagnosis, prognosis, and a determination that the patient is capable, is acting voluntarily, and is making an informed decision. * Either verify that the patient did not have impaired judgment, or refer the patient for an evaluation by a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker licensed in Vermont for confirmation that the patient is capable and does not have impaired judgment. * Consult with the patient's primary care physician, with the patient's consent, if applicable. * Inform the patient of the right to rescind his or her request at the time that the second oral request is made (which can be no fewer than 15 days after the first oral request). * Ensure that all the required steps were carried out in accordance with the law and confirm, immediately prior to writing the prescription, that the patient was making an informed decision. * Write the prescription no fewer than 48 hours after the patient's written request for medication to hasten death, the patient's second oral request (which can be no fewer than 15 days after the first oral request); or the physician offering the patient an opportunity to rescind the request. * Dispense the medication directly (if the physician is licensed to dispense medication in Vermont); or contact a pharmacist (with the patient's consent) and inform the pharmacist of the prescription, and deliver the written prescription personally, by mail or by fax to the pharmacist. * After writing the prescription, promptly file a report with the Department of Health documenting completion of all of the requirements under this statute. History Dick and Ginny Walters, founders of Patient Choices Vermont (PCV) began working to pass Vermont's Act 39 in 2002, based on the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. They were both 77 years old and had no idea that it would take eleven years to pass the bill and another two years to solidify it. They began by studying the Vermont legislative process, and based on numerous meetings in their living room a small group formed a 501(c)(4) corporation. Their daughter, Betsy Walkerman, an attorney who is now President of PCV, drafted the first Vermont bill following the pattern of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. Their daughter Nancy Hawley set up PCV's first website. As the issue moved forward in the legislature, opponents stated that Vermont was targeted by a national organization to pass this law. This was far from the truth. Vermont's death with dignity movement was Vermont-based from the start. Dick and Ginny, knowing that Vermonters, who see themselves as independent thinkers, would not want to be directed by outsiders, they made sure that the organization maintained and displayed its clear Vermont roots. To find sponsors in the legislature, Dick contacted representatives and senators who were likely to be in favor of right-to-die legislation. Early on, thirty-nine representatives and a number of senators agreed to co-sponsor the proposed DWD bill. PCV enlisted the assistance of national organizations to make use of their experience. Both Death with Dignity National Center and Compassion and Choices helped with advice, telephoning, funding, and connections to Oregon people who flew in to testify in legislative committee hearings. Among them were a rabbi, the head of the state hospice organization, and a researcher from Oregon Health & Science University who worked extensively on the statistics in Oregon. From the beginning, PCV's Board of Directors included professors and medical doctors. All were committed to the mission and worked persistently through many years, enabling the group to become close-knit. Early in the process, Dick and Ginny were introduced to the lobbying firm of Sirotkin and Necrason (now the Necrason Group), with whom PCV developed a close and lasting relationship. Their steadfast dedication, invaluable expertise and guidance in strategic planning was critical to the organization's success. In 2004, at the request of the legislature, the Vermont Legislative Counsel studied Oregon's Death with Dignity law and published a report detailing its efficacy and positive outcomes. Through 2009, legislation was proposed in the Vermont House and Senate, and committees in both chambers conducted extensive hearings. PCV organized written and verbal testimony by a wide range of people, including people experienced with the adoption and implementation of the law in Oregon, and numerous individuals with deeply personal and family stories. The underlying theme was freedom to choose. Repeatedly, independent polls showed Vermonters favored the bill by two to one, across political parties and religions. Many individuals with disabilities testified in favor of the legislation because people with disabilities, like everyone else, want to control their own medical decisions when diagnosed with a terminal illness. Opposition was strong and vocal, raising a number of concerns. PCV persistently presented the facts from Oregon. PCV worked strategically through the years to build knowledge and support among legislators and legislative leadership. It took time and citizen action to educate representatives about freedom of choice at the end of life. Throughout Vermont, the proposed legislation gained attention and supporters because of letters to the editor and media accounts. Some PCV Board members spoke at Rotary Clubs, at gatherings at the homes of supporters and at professional meetings of healthcare providers. PCV expanded its database of supporters by setting up DWD displays and collecting signatures at Town Meetings, which take place every year throughout Vermont in the month of March. Among PCV's thousands of supporters were activists who contacted legislators, wrote letters to the editor, and contributed to the campaign. During the most active part of the campaign, PCV engaged a grassroots organizing firm to activate a database by organizing telephone trees, continually updating the website, posting on social media, using email and snail mail and setting up TV ads. Although the Vermont Medical Association testified that Act 39 was not needed, PCV developed a list of 200 supporting physicians. They understood that for the terminally ill patient, just knowing that it's legal to avoid a protracted painful dying process brings peace of mind. By 2013, Vermont had a Governor who was a committed advocate for DWD. The Speaker of the House, a strong and determined leader, also was eager to see the legislation passed. To achieve a majority vote in the Senate, a compromise consisting of a ‚Äúsunset‚Äù provision that would have allowed most of the safeguards to disappear in 2016 was necessary. PCV celebrated passage but was concerned that weakening the required safeguards would make the law vulnerable to repeal. In 2015, Act 39 was revised to remove the sunset provision, and the final bill was signed on May 20, 2015, thereby solidifying Vermont's Act 39. The Governor, the House Speaker, legislators and thousands of ordinary Vermonters came together to establish the Patient Choice at End of Life Act. Impact Twenty-four prescriptions have been written within the first three years after inception of Vermont's Act 39. Sixteen of them were written in 2016, showing a careful, steady utilization increase. Opposition In July, 2016 the Vermont Alliance for Ethical Healthcare and Tennessee-based Christian Medical and Dental Association filed a lawsuit against the State of Vermont. The groups claim both Act 39 and Vermont's Patient Rights law violate the plaintiffs‚Äô religious rights by requiring doctors to discuss all end-of-life care options with their patients. During the first hearing in the case on Nov. 8, the plaintiffs‚Äô attorneys suggested his physician clients would be willing to ‚Äú‚Ä¶tell a patient that they can Google assisted suicide on their cell phone and that's a reasonably available source of information‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThe notion that doctors could fulfill their professional duty to ensure patients can make fully-informed decisions by Googling to learn about their end-of-life care options is the height of irresponsibility,‚Äù said Linda Waite-Simpson, Vermont state director for Compassion & Choices. ‚ÄúIt would be tantamount to doctors abandoning their patients at the most vulnerable time of their lives, especially given the danger of them Googling -- and relying upon -- fake news posted online.‚Äù U.S. District Court Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford has granted a motion by Compassion & Choices, Patient Choices Vermont and two terminally ill Vermonters that allows them to argue in court against a lawsuit brought by religious groups to undermine Vermont's End-of-Life Choice Act (Act 39). In granting the motion to allow Compassion & Choices and Patient Choices Vermont to intervene in the case, Judge Crawford wrote: ‚ÄúAs people potentially eligible for consideration under Act 39, both individual (patient) intervenors have strong personal reasons for resisting the type of silence or boycott which Plaintiffs seek to preserve for themselves on an issue of patient choice ‚Ä¶ the intervenor organizations (Compassion & Choices and Patient Choices Vermont) appear to have considerable experience in the field. The court welcomes their advice and expertise‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Vermont law respects everyone‚Äôs personal beliefs because it allows any person or healthcare professional to refuse to directly participate in medical aid in dying,‚Äù said Kevin D√≠az, national director of legal advocacy for Compassion & Choices. ‚ÄúBut these doctors contend their personal beliefs should trump their patients‚Äô rights when it comes to simply referring them to a healthcare professional to advise them about all their end-of-life care options. It should send shivers down the spine of every patient.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis case is about a patient‚Äôs right to know what their options are at the end of life,‚Äù said Betsy Walkerman, President of Patient Choices Vermont. ‚ÄúPhysicians should not impose their personal religious values on their patients by preventing them from receiving information about all of their end-of-life care options.‚Äù On April 5, 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford ruled that two medical organizations failed to show that their members ‚Äî two doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist who oppose the law for religious and ethical reasons ‚Äî faced any harm and dismissed their legal challenge of Vermont's 2013 end-of-life law.

It is a ground orchid with a single leaf and one or two cream-coloured flowers with thin dark red to blackish tips on the petals and sepals. It is only known from Alligator Gorge in the Mount Remarkable National Park. Description Caladenia flindersica is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, dull green, narrow lance-shaped leaf, long and wide with red or purple blotches near its base. The leaf and the flowering stem are densely covered with erect transparent hairs up to long. One or two cream coloured flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers fade to white as they age and the petals and sepals have thin, dark red to blackish, glandular tips. The dorsal sepal is long, wide, oblong near the base then tapering to a glandular tip long and about wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped near their bases, long, wide and taper to narrow glandular tips similar to that on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, wide, lance-shaped near the base then end in a glandular tip but shorter than those on the sepals. The labellum is lance- shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and has five to eight pairs of linear teeth long on the edges. The tip of the labellum curls downward and there are four or six rows of purplish, stalked calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in late August and September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia flindersica was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones, who gave it the name Arachnorchis flindersica and published the description in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected in Alligator Gorge. In 2008, Robert Bates changed the name to Caladenia flindersica. The specific epithet (flindersica) is a reference to the Flinders Ranges where this species occurs. Distribution and habitat This spider orchid is only known from in and near Alligator Gorge where it grows among shrubs in Eucalypt forest.

History thumbEntrance The University of Northeastern Philippines was established in 1948, in the then Municipality of Iriga. It was founded by a young couple named Felix Sr. and Remedios Alfelor as small school and was first located in a rented property in the town center. Mabini Memorial School, as it was named in the beginning, offered complete high school and degree courses in Education and Liberal Arts. The school, in a few years, outgrew its space located downtown. The school then bought 17 hectares of land, a former dumpsite, near the town center. It then transferred into the new site and developed the campus, completing it in the early 1960s. It then was renamed Mabini College. Additional degrees were offered and school population even grew more rapidly with the diversified campus offerings. In 1974, the school received its university charter and was finally named the University of Northeastern Philippines. Four years later, the College of Law opened. It is the only law school in Iriga. UNEP is considered one of the oldest universities in the Bicol Region, and is also one of the only two universities in Iriga (the other is the University of Saint Anthony).

The division was first formed in the summer of 1941 and was destroyed in the Bryansk pocket in the fall of that year. Reformed in December 1941 in Siberia, the division became a guards unit for its actions in the Battle of Stalingrad in March 1943. It was reformed in July 1943 in the Soviet Far East, and fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, before being disbanded in 1946.  History  = First Formation = The 298th began forming on 2 July 1941 at Kalinin, part of the Moscow Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 886th, 888th, and the 892nd Rifle Regiments, as well as the 828th Artillery Regiment. In early August it was moved west, and assigned to the Reserve Front's 24th Army on 5 August, with its headquarters at Sychyovka. After briefly transferring to the 49th Army, the 298th was withdrawn to the Bryansk Front reserve to complete its formation. In September it became part of the 13th Army of the front. At the beginning of Operation Typhoon, the German offensive on Moscow, the division was trapped and destroyed in the Bryansk pocket by mid-October. On 27 December the 298th was officially disbanded. = Second Formation = The 298th was reformed from late December 1941 to 17 January 1942 at Barnaul, part of the Siberian Military District. Its basic order of battle was the same as the previous formation, and the 298th's commander was assigned on 17 January. After completing its formation, the division was transferred west to the Western Front's 50th Army, where it remained until August. In response to Case Blue, the German summer offensive which was advancing on Stalingrad, the 298th was moved to south and became an infantry unit of the 4th Tank Army, fighting in the Stalingrad area. The division became part of the 24th Army just before it fought in Operation Uranus in November, the Soviet counteroffensive, which trapped German troops in Stalingrad. It was transferred to the 21st Army reserve by 16 December. On 28 and 29 December, an assault group from the division participated in attacks alongside assault groups from four other rifle divisions, inflicting heavy losses on the German 44th and 376th Infantry Divisions. In the original offensive plan for Operation Ring, the offensive that eliminated the pocket, the division, still with 21st Army, held positions on the margins of the Marinovka salient held by XIV Panzer Corps, and was to play a supporting role in the assault. For the offensive, which began on 10 January, the division held positions on the western face of the salient adjacent to the 96th Rifle Division; both units were to advance east from Bairak Balka towards Vodyanaya Balka against stay-behind forces from the 8th and 29th Regiments of the German 3rd Motorized Division. The assault was successful, and on 12 January it attacked southeast and east alongside the 277th and 96th Rifle Divisions, advancing between 3 and 4 kilometers and pushing the remnants of the 29th and 3rd Motorized Divisions into a narrow pocket southwest of the Dmitrievka- Karpovka road. For the attack on 13 January, the division was regrouped in order to advance east towards Pitomnik Airfield alongside other 21st Army divisions, where it would link up with troops of the 57th Army. The 298th remained with the 24th Army during Operation Ring in January and February 1943, which eliminated the pocket. For its actions at Stalingrad, the division was converted into the 80th Guards Rifle Division on 1 March. = Third Formation = The 298th was reformed for the third and last time on 1 July 1943 in the Transbaikal Front, still with the same basic order of battle as previous formations. It became part of the 36th Army, with which it served for the rest of the war. The division fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria from 8 August to 3 September 1945, during which it quickly advanced through Japanese fortifications at Jalainur and Manzhouli in less than two days, meeting only disorganized resistance. The rest of the advance was mostly unopposed pursuit into Manchuria, so the division only saw about two days of combat. The division received the honorific \\"Khingan\\" for its actions, and was disbanded during the spring and summer of 1946 as part of the Transbaikal-Amur Military District.

The chapel adjoins the museum of the castle complex and is an integral part of the site. It is known for its fifteenth-century frescoes in the Byzantine or Orthodox style, unusual for Catholic Poland.  History  Plan of the chapel The chapel was most likely constructed before 1326, when it was part of the castle complex. In the 14th century, it was a single-story building with a crypt. It possessed a nave, as well as a polygonal presbytery, which was contained within the circumference of the castle's defensive walls. In 1407, the chapel was rebuilt in the gothic style by order of King Ladislaus II Jagiello (Jogaila of Lithuania). After increasing the height of the walls, the chapel became a two-story structure, maintaining the old crypt. The form of the church was dominated by two steep step-patterned gables which survived until the 1650s. The lowest level of the building was designated as a crypt for deceased chaplains and local administrators, while the upper levels were used for religious services. The polygonal presbytery as well as the square nave were rib-vaulted. The vaulting of the nave was supported by a centrally-planned pillar. This structural element was typical for the sacral and secular architecture during the reign of Casimir III the Great. During the Renaissance, the church maintained a gothic character, however the entrance was positioned on the first floor (that is, one floor above ground-level) and was framed by a new Renaissance portal, made in the Komask√≥w masonry workshop. It wasn't until the 17th century that the facade of the chapel was crested with a gable and attic in the style of the Lublin Renaissance. During the parliamentary sessions in 1569 regarding the Union of Lublin, a holy mass was held at the Holy Trinity Chapel, asking for successful deliberations. Some of participants left inscriptions on the walls of the chapel commemorating the event. Extensive fresco work was conducted in the interior of the church in the 1410s by an anonymous team of Ruthenian painters under the supervision of Master Andrey. It was during this time that the walls and ceiling were covered in a Rutheno-Byzantine polychrome. The paintings were completed in 1418, which is noted in Cyrillic on the patronage tablet, located on the arch between the nave and the presbytery of the church. Along with religious scenes decorating the interior of the church, there are two portraits of King Ladislaus II, the patron of the painting project. The polychrome was conducted with various techniques: both on dry and wet plaster with tempera paint. Holy Trinity Chapel during the day. During the construction of the new prison complex within the castle, in the years 1823‚Äì1826, the church was adjoined to the neogothic structures and became the prison chapel. The interior and exterior were then plastered over, destroying the priceless polychrome. Toward the end of the 19th century, the chapel underwent a number of small changes: the exterior stairs were dismantled and the portal was converted into a window. In 1897 J√≥zef Smoli≈Ñski discovered part of the 15th century polychrome. In the years 1917‚Äì1918, further portions of the paintings were uncovered.  Renovations and Reinforcement Projects  The church underwent a complete renovation in the 1950s, after the castle was designated to serve cultural purposes. Around the year 1970, ceramic tiles were removed from the chapel roof and were replaced with metal sheet. The exterior plaster was removed and the historical frescoes were reconstructed. The paintings' renovation was completed in the 1990s. In August 2007, the chapel underwent work meant to rectify cracks that had developed in the walls of the presbytery. Large concrete supports were applied under the foundations of the chapel. Cracks, some even 1 cm wide, had developed due to rainfall, which had removed sediment from underneath the foundations. It is possible that the damage occurred more than a hundred years ago. More than two thousand liters of binding substance, a mixture of white cement and lime paste, were injected. The ceiling of the presbytery was laden with a carbon fiber reinforcing net submerged in a mineral matrix. A steal band was installed above the ceiling to support the entire structure. The last phase of the renovation work took place in the spring of 2008: the signs of cracking were corrected and covered with reconstructed frescoes.

Van der Beugel studied at the University of York before going on to create work using multiple types of clay and concrete. His work is on permanent display at Chatsworth House, Derbyshire and in the collections of Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Van der Beugel's work is collected internationally and held in numerous private collections.  Early life and education  Van der Beugel was born in London in 1978. Between 1997 and 2001 he studied History of Art at the University of York where he studied under Michael White. Between 2001-2002 he was an apprentice to Rupert Spira, and then from 2003 to 2004 he was assistant to Edmund de Waal. Since 2004 he has been based in Devon, where he has his studio.  Art market  Van der Beugel shows work through the New Art Centre, Roche Court, East Winterslow, Wiltshire.  Work  His piece From Here to There was acquired by the Victoria & Albert Museum in 2008. At Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire commissioned The North Sketch Sequence in 2014. This large scale installation represents the mitochondrial DNA of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire and their son and daughter-in-law, Lord and Lady Burlington in a series of 650 ceramic panels and protruding ceramic blocks organised into 4 columns. The author, Alain de Botton described The North Sketch Sequence as \\"a beautiful poetic work which is exemplary in the way it manages to turn information (of which we have so much, and which usually leaves us so cold) into art (which touches our hearts)\\". Van der Beugel's work has recently featured in a film series by Sotheby's and Huntsman titled \\"Treasures of Chatsworth\\". More recently van der Beugel worked in collaboration with ECSG, the Epidemiology Cancer Statistics Group based at York University, the resulting work Pathways of Patients I &II; are \\" two 275-pound architectural concrete panels delicately scored by snakelike patterns \\" in liquid rust. From 2018 to 2019 van der Beugel was The Wallace Collection Artist in Residence where he worked closely with museum's curators and studied the Collection's objects and archives with an aim to explore the theme of legacy, and humanity's attempts to endure. In the summer of 2019, The King and Queen of the Netherlands announced the completion of major renovations to their home, Huis ten Bosch Palace. This included the installation of an immersive ceramic room by Jacob van der Beugel. Taking three years to make and crafted from nearly 60,000 handmade blocks, the artwork depicts the DNA of the King and Queen of The Netherlands and its future Queen, a symbolic global citizen, or as van der Beugel describes, \\"a portrait of all of us\\" \\\\- a human portrait of the past and of the future. Van der Beugel believes the idea of portraiture is fundamental to such a house as Huis ten Bosch Palace. \\"Grand houses like this should absorb people's stories...It's what people do: they leave their own mark, which breathes new life into the house.\\" A Mutating Story, van der Beugel's solo exhibition at the Museum Beelden aan Zee, Scheveningen, will run from 20th March 2020 through to 28th June 2020. \\"In his monumental sculptures, the Dutch artist Jacob van der Beugel presents human cells as a ‚Äòbiological landscape‚Äô.

Biography  Rubinstein was born in Czernowitz (then part of Austria-Hungary, now Chernivtsi, Ukraine) into the Jewish family of the banker and parliamentarian Isak Rubinstein (c. 1804‚Äì1878). Her mother died when she was young.History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries, Volume 2 edited by Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer, p. 66 She and her three siblings were greatly encouraged to pursue their education, even though this was a time when girls were often denied that opportunity. (A high school for girls was eventually opened in Czernowitz in1898 and a girls' grammar school was established only during the years just before the First World War.) At first, her father arranged for Rubinstein to take private lessons but, when it came time to finish high school, she was unable to take the necessary examinations from tutors, so she did so before an academic committee from a boys' high school. Rubinstein went on to study psychology and German literature at the University of Prague, in the spring of 1870, and then at the Leipzig University three years later. After being denied admission to the doctoral program in Basel, Switzerland, she enrolled at the University of Bern and there she gained a Ph.D. in 1874 in psychology and German literature. By doing so, she became the first woman to receive a doctorate in Bern. Her thesis was \\"Uber die sensoriellen und sensitiven Sinne\\" (\\"About the sensory and sensitive senses\\"). With the completion of her doctorate, Rubinstein spent a year in Germany visiting Leipzig, Heidelberg and Munich.

The division was first formed in the summer of 1941 and was destroyed during the Battle of Moscow in the fall of that year. The division was reformed in June 1942 and fought in the Battle of Stalingrad, the Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation and the Belgrade Offensive, before being disbanded postwar in the summer of 1945.  History  = First Formation = The 299th Division began forming on 10 July 1941 at Belgorod, part of the Orel Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 956th, 958th, and the 960th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 843rd Artillery Regiment and 363rd Reconnaissance Company. In early August, the division moved west to the Bryansk Front, where it was assigned to the 50th Army by the end of August. The 299th was caught up in Operation Typhoon, the German attack on Moscow, at the end of September. Although it was not trapped in the Bryansk pocket, the division suffered heavy losses in the fighting in October and early November, and on 18 November only 800 men were left in the division. On 3 December, the 299th was officially disbanded, possibly to add replacements to one of the other divisions preparing for the Soviet counteroffensive at Moscow. = Second Formation = The 299th Rifle Division was reformed on 6 June 1942 from a rifle brigade at Kovrov, part of the Moscow Military District. Its basic order of battle was the same as the previous formation, and it was quickly assigned to the 10th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In August the 299th was transferred to the 8th Reserve Army, which became the 66th Army. The division moved with the army to the Stalingrad Front. As part of the 66th Army, the 299th fought in Operation Uranus in November, the Soviet counteroffensive which encircled the German 6th Army in Stalingrad. The division then fought in Operation Ring during January and February 1943, which eliminated the pocket. While the army was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, the 299th transferred to the 53rd Army in the Steppe Military District (Steppe Front from July). In August the division fought in the Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation, during which it was in the second echelon of the 53rd Army attack which broke through to recapture Kharkov on 23 August. For its actions, the 299th was awarded the honorific \\"Kharkov.\\" In January 1944, the 299th became part of the 5th Guards Army. The division was transferred back and forth between the 53rd Army, the 5th Guards Army, and 2nd Ukrainian Front reserves until September. In September, during the advance into Yugoslavia, the division became part of the 57th Army's 75th Rifle Corps. The division fought in the Belgrade Offensive and then advanced into Hungary south of Lake Balaton and Budapest. At the end of the war, the division was part of the 64th Rifle Corps, still with the 57th Army. The division was disbanded in the summer of 1945, part of the Southern Group of Forces.

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The inn is mentioned in Ernest Hemingway's short story, \\"Up in Michigan,\\" and tradition has it that the inn's proprietor during the 1910s and 20s, Vollie Fox, taught Hemingway how to fish. History In 1870, Horton Bay's founder Samuel Horton established a homestead at this site. In 1876, Alonzo J. Stroud and William H. Ohle set up a sawmill near here and were soon employing up to 30 workers. With the influx of workers, Horton Bay quickly grew into a small community, and the need for a general store and other services soon became apparent. William H. Ohle withdrew from the sawmill business and concentrated on real estate and construction in the new community. Ohle supervised the construction of many early buildings in the community These includied the Horton Bay General Store, as well as the next-door boardinghouse (now the Red Fox Inn) in about 1878. The boardinghouse soon acquired the name \\"Horton Bay House,\\" and it served as a boardinghouse for millworkers, and as a hotel for transients. The boardinghouse function lasted until the mill closed in 1890. Although the Horton Bay House still operated as a hotel, the transient population was declining, and much of the space was rented to local families on a long-term basis. During this time, the house was owned by James Dilworth, who had been a blacksmith at the sawmill. In 1910, Dilworth sold the building to James Wixham Fox, the local highway commissioner, and his wife Mary. James Fox died in 1914, and in 1915 Mary signed over the property to her son Vollie Fox. In 1919, Vollie Fox and his wife Lizzie Spura Fox established a restaurant in the building, the Red Fox Inn. As the automobile became more pervasive, this area of northwestern lower Michigan was becoming a popular summer tourist destination, and the Red Fox Inn catered to the burgeoning tourist trade. Vollie Fox died in 1947 and Lizzie Spura Fox, became the sole owner. In 1955, Lizzie Fox sold the Red Fox Inn to her daughter, Marian Ruth Fox Hartwell. Hartwell owned the Inn until 1984, when she sold it to her son, James Vol Hartwell. The restaurant in the building remained in operation until the 1970s. After that time, the Red Fox Inn served as a bed-and-breakfast, operating during the summer months. The Red Fox Inn also served as a local products store, including Ernest Hemingway memorabilia. James Vol Hartwell died in 2015, and the building and store passed to his children, Ernest and Prudence Hartwell. Description The Red Fox Inn is a two-story, side-gable, white-painted building constructed in a later 19th century vernacular style. It is clad with clapboard with narrow cornerboards, and has projecting eaves with plain raking cornices. A screened-in porch runs the width of the front. The interior has three large dining rooms on the first floor, as well as a series of kitchen rooms added in stages from about 1919 to 1935. The second story contains four guest rooms, a parlor, and a bathroom. The third floor is a long, unfinished stand-up attic. The entire house has the original woodwork, as well as the original paneled doors, knobs and hinges.

It was made by Real Film at the Wandsbek Studios in Hamburg with location filming on the Altes Land. The film's sets were designed by Mathias Matthies. Plot The veterinarian Benningsen is called because of an urgent case on the Pferdegest√ºt Gut Lindenhof. There are problems with the mare Atalante. Benningsen is surprised to see Barbara Hessling. Both know each other from earlier, and their reunion clearly shows that the last time they left each other, there were problems. Flashback. Dieter Benningsen and Barbara had met four years earlier when he had successfully worked as an obstetrician on one of their horses, Ariadne, whom she thought to be suffering from colic. The young foal is baptized by landowner Dahlen Atalante. Dahlen, who was friends with Barbara's father, gives her Atalante. The much older man seems to have (probably not only paternal) interest in the young woman. Barbara has already given Dieter her heart, but he must move to Hanover for a year to complete his veterinary studies there. Some time later, Dahlen invites Barbara to join Atalante for the Yearling Show. Also Dieter Benningsen appears there. While the guests attend the derby, Benningsen makes Barbara a marriage proposal, which she accepts. A little later, Atalante is successively trained to become a racehorse. Master jockey Hans R√∂nning even allows Barbara to do it herself. Finally, the first derby start for Atalante is imminent. In fact, R√∂nning can win the race with Atalante. As Barbara begins to devote more and more attention to her horse and racing, Benningsen is increasingly annoyed by the fact that his future wife apparently hardly knows any other topic. Benningsen announces to Barbara that they should not see each other for a while. Meanwhile, a friend of Dahlens, Evelyn Nauman, who owns the strongest competition horse with \\"Hannibal\\", tries to sow intrigue with Barbara, who decides to train Atalante herself. Finally, in a pro race to a direct comparison between Atalante and Hannibal, Atalante barely wins. Too bad luck, Atalante pulls a little later a Sehnenzerrung, so R√∂nning refuses to lead the battered horse in the coming, big Derby. Instead, he plans to direct Hannibal. Barbara is disappointed. In this situation, the worn-out aging jockey Konny Schmidt offers to help Barbara, who hopes to be able to come out of his lows again. He says that you have to handle Atalante just right, then he could win with her tomorrow's derby. Barbara leaves Konny on her horse, although Dieter Bennigsen had urgently advised against it. Hannibal barely wins the race because Atalante begins to lame just before the finish. Barbara realizes that she has overwhelmed her horse, who probably can not run a race anymore. Dahlen offers to stay with Atalante at his stud farm. End of the flashback. Again in the present time. Benningsen and Barbara spent the night with Atalante, who gave birth to a foal. Dieter and Barbara decide to try it again.

Wilson (1894‚Äì1956) was a Scottish professional footballer, who played as an outside left (winger), primarily with Heart of Midlothian. Club career Wilson was born in 1894 in Edinburgh and lived at McLeod Street, close to Tynecastle; he was a Hearts supporter in childhood. He began his career with local juvenile sides before joining Arniston Rangers of the Junior grade, and represented Scotland at that level in two matches. He was signed by Hearts in 1912, aged 18, alongside Paddy Crossan who became a lodger at the Wilson family home. Wilson made his debut in April 1912 in a 2‚Äì0 loss to Airdrieonians. In the following season his returns in the league were an impressive 15 goals from 23 games as the club placed 4th. He continued to feature regularly for Hearts in 1913‚Äì14, when they finished 4th again, and at the outset of 1914‚Äì15 they began strongly and were top of the league in November. By that point World War I was intensifying, and in the wake of public scrutiny over the willingness of sportsmen to join up for the armed forces, the squad enlisted en masse into what became known as McCrae's Battalion. The Scottish League continued to operate, but Hearts were depleted and had to settle for the runners-up spot. Wilson was selected for the Scottish League XI in March 1915 with club teammate Jimmy Frew. In 1915‚Äì16 military commitments began to take hold, and soon after scoring a hat-trick in a 4‚Äì0 away win over Rangers Wilson was called up to join his unit. From then on he made occasional appearances for Hearts when possible and also had a spell as a guest player for Leeds City. In May 1916, he was selected for Scotland in an unofficial wartime international (the only game of this nature during the course of the war itself). While several of his teammates fought and perished at the Battle of the Somme, a problematic dislocated shoulder (sustained on the football field rather than the battlefield) meant that Wilson could not fire a rifle effectively, and he was held on reserve. He did see frontline action in 1917 at Arras and was wounded. At the conclusion of the hostilities in 1918 Wilson returned to Edinburgh and was in the Hearts side which was a finalist in the 1919 Victory Cup. For the next four seasons he was once again an important component of the team, averaging 34 league games and 6 goals each campaign despite being troubled by his shoulder injury. In July 1923 he received a benefit match, and a few weeks later left the club having amassed 273 competitive appearances and 72 goals for Hearts. Wilson moved on to second-tier Cowdenbeath[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 and in his first season helped them to gain promotion. His top-level career thus resumed, as Cowden achieved an all-time high league placing of 5th in 1924‚Äì25 and retained their divisional status up to Wilson's final season, 1928‚Äì29 (and for several years beyond). After retiring from football, Wilson ran a sweet shop and relocated to the north-west of England to work in his trade of tinsmith. He died in 1956.

Blue or red sashes of the pattern shown were worn by all units of the Army of Africa; the Legion however, officially adopted the Ceinture Bleue (blue sash) in 1882. The Saharan Mounted Companies of the French Foreign Legion consisted of legionnaires of various nationalities and races transferred from the existing French Foreign Legion infantry and cavalry regiments. These units should not be confused with the Saharan M√©haristes Companies (a separate camel corps with Arab/Berbers personnel recruited from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, with French officers) which are covered in detail in the M√©hariste article.  History since 1800  A camel regiment () was created by Napoleon Bonaparte during the Egyptian Campaign () in 1799 and 1801. Following the French occupation of Algeria, the use of mules and camels for military purposes was trialled between 1843 and 1848. Mules continued to be used for carrying supplies but no operational requirements justifying the employment of camels emerged until French expansion reached the boundaries of the Sahara. The first military-mule units were created in 1885, during the occupation of South-Oran. They were organized in units of 250 men, each divided into two platoons of two section. Each mule was shared between two soldiers, carrying their equipment as well as one man at a time. The pair of soldiers would alternate between riding and walking, for long-distance marches. The mule companies were established as permanent units in 1901 at the initiative of Commandant Laperrine (). Their designations, numbers and areas of operation changed with time. These mule units were generally employed as and where needed, and were not permanently stationed in specific territories. The law of March 30, 1902 created five Saharan companies. Three other companies formed of four platoons each already existed in the French Levant () as well as nomadic groups in French West Africa ()). The latter were based respectively at Fort-Polignac (Tassili), Tindouff, El Oued, Adrar, and Tamanrasset. These mule and camel companies were commanded by officers of the Indigenous Affairs Bureau and depended on the directorate of the infantry. Each of the M√©hariste (camel mounted) units included 68 dromedaries (M√©haris). However, several Mounted Saharan Companies where created at Ouargla (), Columb-Becharm () and Ain Sefra (), Laghouat () and Sebha() for Mounted Saharan Companies of the Foreign Legion (CSPLE). Later, these companies were merged to form four distinct companies of Mounted Saharan Companies of the Foreign Legion (CSPL). A M√©haristes Company was also created in 1921 in Palmyra () during the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon () under the designation of 1st M√©hariste Company of the Levant. The company became in 1936 the 1st Light Desert Company () and was dissolved in June 1945. M√©haristes & Saharan Companies insignias and fanions  Saharan units of the French Foreign Legion  = 1st company = On November 1, 1940, the Automobile Company of the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment (1er REI) became an autonomous unit, designated as the Mounted Saharan Company of the Legion ().Note that in the French language, the designation of \\"Mounted Company\\" (French: Compagnie Port√©e) could refer to motorized, camel or horse mounted units. The designation of \\"Motorized Company\\" (), by contrast, was strictly applied to motor transport. The designation \\"Mounted\\" Saharan Companies () is however also used in respect of motorized units equipped with artillery. The company first garrisoned at Tabelbala then A√Øn Sefra from March 1944. On March 15, 1946, the company formed two new companies being the 1st Mounted Saharan Company of the Legion (1reCSPL) and the 2nd Mounted Saharan Company of the Legion (2eCSPL). The 1st Mounted Saharan Company of the Legion (1re CSPL) garrisoned at Fort-Flatters in 1955 then at Ksar El Hirane in 1960. On January 1, 1961, the 1st Mounted Saharan Company of the Legion () became the 1st Mounted Saharan Squadron of the Foreign Legion (). = 1st squadron = Equipped with light armor (), the squadron was assimilated to a unit of the Armored Corps () within armament. This unit formed a corps and was independent at the same title of an actual regiment, much as its equipment as well as its missions. The squadron was stationed at ksar El Hirane, near Laghouat and mounted police patrols in the desert as well launched raids on spotted positions of the enemy. In 1961, following the generals putsch, the 1st Mounted Saharan Squadron of the Foreign Legion was charged with guarding arrested civilian and military participants, before their repatriation to France. In August 1962, the 1st Mounted Saharan Squadron of the Foreign Legion () lost three men in action, including lieutenant G√©las. These were the last French fatalities of the Algerian War. Stationed at Reggane and at Aoulef since July 1962, the squadron was dissolved and integrated into the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment (2e REI) on March 1, 1963.

Separate units of m√©haristes consisted of locally recruited (Arab and Berber) personnel mounted on Arabian Camels or M√©haris) When created during the 1930s the 5th CSP was motorized, making use of vehicles specially adapted for desert conditions. The various Saharan Companies varied in size and numbers according to their differing roles and personnel (i.e. French, Legion or indigenous). They generally included a command platoon and two to four sections, making up a total formation of 142 to 178 men. = Mounted Saharian Companies (CSP)= All five of these companies were organized within the same structure: * 1 command section * 1 platoon with light armored vehicle () * 3 mounted sections of Fusiliers- Voltigeurs * 1 section of artillery cannon type 75mm (mainly the Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897) They counted 195 men with light armored vehicles AMM8 types, 4x4 types and 6x6 type wheels amongst other means of displacements. = Saharan Annexes Groupment = *Saharan Annex Groupment of Algeria In Algeria, four Saharans Annex Groupment constituted police forces assigned in support to the posts south of the territory.

Following the Second World War, the white and blue uniform shown was retained as a parade uniform only, being replaced for regular duties by khaki drill and kepi cover. Saharan M√©haristes Companies The Saharan M√©haristes Companies () were locally recruited camel mounted units of the French Armed Forces employed to patrol and control the territories of the Sahara bordering on Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco during the period of French rule.

Background The pygmy Batwa are often exploited and allegedly enslaved by the Luba and other Bantu groups. While the pygmy never organized militarily to resist, starting with the First Congo War, rebel leader Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, who won the war, organized the Twa into paramilitary groups to help him. His son, Joseph Kabila, who succeeded him, used these militias in the Second Congo War and against the predominately Luba Mai-Mai Kata Katanga. Course of the conflict Bantu militiamen with MONUSCO observers, Mulonge, Kalemie Territory, 2017. In Tanganyika Province, in the northern part of the former Katanga Province, starting in 2013, Pygmy Batwa rose up into militias, such as the \\"Perci\\" militia, and attacked Luba villages. A Luba militia known as \\"Elements\\" attacked back, notably killing at least 30 people in the \\"Vumilia 1\\" displaced people camp in April 2015. Since the start of the conflict, hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes. The weapons used in the conflict are often arrows, axes, and machetes, rather than guns. In October 2015, Pygmy and Luba leaders sign a peace deal to end the conflict. In September 2016, the United Nations along with provincial authorities established local councils called \\"baraza\\" to address grievances and this appeared to reduce the violence. However, clashes intensified at the end of 2016, as the government tried to enforce a tax on caterpillars that the Batwa harvest as a major source of income to sell as a delicacy around the capital Kinshasa, while the military attempted to arrest a Twa warlord. Both of these events led to a violent backlash and a spread of the fighting. Twa militias also started to target Tutsis, another Bantu group, by slaughtering their cows. A ceasefire brokered by the United Nations in February 2017 failed, and the violence continued. The International Rescue Committee said more than 400 villages were destroyed between July 2016 and March 2017. In August 2017, the clashes intensified after Batwa attacked a group of Luba near Kalemie; in course of the following fighting about 50 people died, most of them Luba. Batwa fighters also attacked a MONUSCO convoy with arrows. A number of Blue Helmets were wounded, though they still opted not to return fire. By the end of 2017, the economy in Tanganyika had mostly collapsed, while fields could no longer be harvested. As result, malnutrition spread amongst those who had fled, as well as those who stayed at their homes. Casualties IDPs from Nyunzu Territory who have fled the clashes between Batwa and Luba. =Deaths= More than a thousand people were killed in the first eight months of 2014 alone. =Displaced people= The number of displaced people are estimated to be 650,000 as of December 2017. Around March 2017, 543,000 had fled, up from 370,000 in December 2016, the strongest growth of the current conflicts in the Congo, which has the largest population of displaced people in Africa. Many refugees are allegedly forced by the government to leave the camps and return to their homes, where the fighting still continues.

Vollert: Wandertheater am Flussufer um 1750 Deutsche Wanderb√ºhne (German Travelling Theatres) is the term for roving German- speaking, theatrical troupes or travelling operas, consisting of professional actors and musicians. They were financially independent but did not have their own fixed stage. Such travelling troupes in Germany had, since the 17th century, developed themselves in opposition to the German Princely Court Theatres (Hoftheatern). They entertained the people with farces, theatrical travesties and parodies of the courtly tragedies and operas. Their productions followed a particular structure known as Haupt- und Staatsaktion, which featured one larger ‚Äòmain‚Äô production alongside several smaller skits and more improvised acts ‚Äì the content often included political content, relating to affairs of state. With the rise of the first national theatres in Germany, these forms of drama gradually became less significant in the 18th century ‚Äì even though Wanderb√ºhne were visiting German towns until well into the 19th century.  The organisation of a Wanderb√ºhne  Spitzweg: Reisende Kom√∂dianten um 1838 The organisation of Deutsche Wanderb√ºhne remained roughly the same from the 17th to the 19th century. The travelling actors came together within the structures of so-called dramatic or acting societies ‚Äì in essence, these were mostly family businesses under the leadership of a Prinzipal. This theatrical business was the organisational and artistic driver of these privately led troupes. They also usually provided the necessary licences, financial backing, props and costumes. The Prinzipal made decisions on the engagement of new or additional actors. Furthermore, he took care of discipline; managed the financial income and outgoings; chose and edited the new plays; and devised the programme and staging locations. In certain circumstances, Deutsche Wanderb√ºhne had a ‚ÄòTheatre Master‚Äô for special areas of expertise, such as set-design, special effects or the organisation of the technical processes. When this was not the case, the Prinzipal would take responsibility for these matters in addition to his usual tasks such as: assigning roles, leading rehearsals and overseeing the theatrical business. For required orchestral elements of performances, an ensemble local to the performance location would normally be contracted in. At that time, there was not yet a director in the modern sense of the word. However, a ballet master was required for tableaux vivants. Actors learned their trade predominantly within dance training. Friedrich Ludwig Schr√∂der started his career as a ‚ÄòTumbler‚Äô. Joseph Anton Christ also proudly reported that he had performed ballet. Furthermore, a training in singing was also part of the actor‚Äôs skill- set, as they were required to perform a form of German musical theatre known as Singspiele (comparable to early opera). The Prinzipal was also the one who possessed the requisite performance licences from the respective provincial Lords; at that time, without such permissions, travelling theatre troupes were not allowed to perform within Germanic territories. Princes would bestow these privileges upon their favoured acting groups. It was customary that they made appearances at court theatres and that they were also given the title of a court‚Äôs official acting troupe. The theatrical troupe would normally make guest appearances as part of tournaments taking place at localities within their allocated performance territories. In small towns, performances were mostly carried out as open-air theatre on wooden stages at marketplaces or squares. Whilst in bigger areas it was possible to perform in purpose-built showing booths ‚Äì known as Schaubuden ‚Äì at guest-houses, barns and other similar locations. If the troupe performed in one fixed building, the Prinzipal held a lease at his own risk. There were only ever artistic directors at the larger court theatres, and directors appointed by civic authorities or organisations only became customary for the first time in the 19th century. Because only a small number of troupes were given performance rights within a territory, there was hard-fought competition between theatrical groups. This led to the poaching of the opposition's popular and well-known acting talents. Troupes that did not receive performance rights had to spread out to new areas, which led to the Wanderb√ºhne reaching far into Russia and into Baltic regions where parts of the population spoke German.  The production programme of a Wanderb√ºhne  Harlequin The private travelling theatrical troupes oriented their programme of productions almost exclusively towards an often uneducated public who were seeking humorous entertainment; these Wanderb√ºhne were dependent upon the donations and entrance fees paid by such audiences. In order to ensure that they did not lose the public's interest, theatre troupes had to regularly perform new plays. This meant that poetic patterning was only roughly adhered to ‚Äì or in some cases it was completely left out and the actors improvised. This was because there was not sufficient time to constantly study new plays in depth. Theatre in the Wanderb√ºhne was primarily concerned with pure entertainment and amusement. The programme was dominated by the aforementioned Haupt- und Staatsaktion forms. They centred around innuendos, bawdy jokes and farcical interludes involving Harlequin or Hanswurst characters. The performances consisted of a sequence of action-packed individual acts, which sometimes involved aspects of situational comedy. These acts were made into a spectacle in which the visual effects of lavish costumes, grandiose sets and attention-grabbing special-effects were considered to be more important than the quality of the acting. This was partly because, during that period, a completely different understanding of art was dominant and the role of acting tended to be seen as the work of a tradesman or craftsman. It was customary that actors were proficient in the puppet-show, because restricted space often didn‚Äôt allow for them to perform on a bigger stage. Therefore, puppet-shows were part of the ‚Äòbad-weather programme‚Äô. In keeping with the English and Italian models of travelling theatre, the Wanderb√ºhne practised a form of improvised drama, in which the style of delivery was shaped improvisations, type-cast roles and realistic clarity. The actors specialised in playing particular types of role or even fixed roles ‚Äì parts that would appear again and again, which fitted best with the actors‚Äô gender, age and appearance. Those that were able to provide the clearest embodiment of characters by over-acting, were often considered to be the best actors. Interaction between individual players did not exist in the modern sense, due to the fact that the actors took over studying for the part, the often over-the-top costumes (the Prinzipal provided them with what was known as ‚Äòcostume money‚Äô) and competed to win the approval of the public. In this way the directorial duties of the Prinzipal were limited to allocating the actors with roles, and ensuring that they were positioned on-stage in the correct relation to one another.  The unique form of Wanderoper or ‚ÄòTravelling Opera‚Äô  One unique form of theatre performed during the 18th century was the ‚ÄòTravelling Opera‚Äô or Wanderoper. It was performed in the German court theatres as well as on the travelling stages of the Wanderb√ºhne. In addition to the singers, the Wanderoper had additional instrumentalists, whose instruments, music and music-stands had to be carried by the troupe ‚Äì unless musicians local to the particular destinations were used instead. This theatre-form also required intensive preparation and a musical director. Improvisation did not always exist as it did in the theatrical acts. In the intervals, however, entertainers, such as rope dancers, also made appearances. As from the middle of the century, the emphasis on Italian opera reverted to the German courts, a bourgeois interest in ‚Äòsinging and light operas‚Äô arose. Following the style of the famous Italian wanderers such as those of the Girolamo Bon, German operatic groups arose, working as entrepreneurial businesses. These include the troupes of Johann Friedrich Sch√∂nemann (1704‚Äì1782), Abel Seyler (1730‚Äì1800) with the Seyler Theatre Company (founded 1769) and Emanuel Schikaneder (1751‚Äì1812). These theatrical ensembles had both musical and spoken theatre in their repertoires. Wilhelm Pfannkuch: Organisationen der Musik.  Historical development  = Middle Ages and Renaissance = The theatrical landscape of the German-speaking regions in the middle-ages and the Renaissance period was characterised by religiously motivated spiritual performances, which were originally directed or led by clergy, and later also used as representations of civic service in the Middle Ages. The purpose of Mystery and Passion Play, Fastnachtspiele, or the Jesuit and the Protestant school of scholarship lay above all in the conversion, the instruction and the moral education of society. These performances were often assisted by many citizens who were highly regarded as amateur actors. The German amateur-theatres enjoyed great popularity and remained long after the end of their prominence, even though they lost importance with the emergence of the first foreign travelling theatrical groups. Benjamin Cuyp: Wanderschausteller around 1645, Niederlande The first Italian acting troupes moved across the Alps at the end of the fifteenth century, but played primarily in aristocratic circles, in which the Italian was powerful. With the development of Italian opera as the most popular form of theatre at the European courts after 1600, many of the Italian comedy groups in the German region saw themselves forced to open up to new audiences because they could not compete with this new form of musical theatre. Thus, they turned to the German middle class, which, however, did not understand Italian. The Commedia dell'arte performances of the Italian theatre groups developed into a sort of pantomime whose comic action was mediated by masks and exaggerated gestures and movement. By the end of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the English comedians of the Elizabethan Theatre moved across Denmark and the Netherlands into the German-speaking areas. As a result, there was a struggle between these and the Italian theatre groups for the attention of the German public, which was complicated by the arrival of French troupes in the 18th century. = The beginnings of independence = In the 17th century, in the German-speaking world, a German professional theatre was formed in response to the foreign theatrical groups. This development began with the inclusion of German actors in the ensembles of English troupes, which gradually led to purely German-speaking travelling theatrical groups. From the English models, the texts were taken as the basis for performances, in which elements of the Commedia dell'arte were also added. Thus, at Wanderb√ºhne, a unique form of comedy appeared. The German-speaking counterpart to Pickelhering or Arlecchino was the comic figure of the Viennese Hanswurst, created by Stranitzky, who appeared as an added servant figure in transposed and strongly coarsened versions of French or Italian tragedies, which served as a template for his jokes. In addition to the troupes that offered stories and tales of adventure to the general public, theatre groups were also formed that played at the princely courts and before the educated public. One example of this was the Hochdeutsche Hofcom√∂dianten and their successor groups, which brought important innovations in the landscape of the Wanderb√ºhne: longer, more literarily elaborate plays, dramas and female actors for women's roles. In addition to adaptations of English, Italian and French materials (such as Shakespeare and Moli√®re), German materials for plays were also used. = Enlightenment = At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the literary enlightenment and the Leipzig circle (surrounding the literary theorist Johann Christoph Gottsched) led to a reform of the German theatre, modelled on French classical music. As a result, the German Wanderb√ºhne, especially the Neubauer group run by the Prinzipal and stage reformer Caroline Neuber, began to stick more closely to the poetical models of the mostly French theatrical texts. They also implement them by means of the French-pathetic theatrical style. This demanded a greater skill from the actors and helped the German theatre to reach a higher artistic standard. However, this led to criticism in France, as well as in Germany, at a time which had already set itself free from the classical models. The French representation, with its courtly costumes and gestures, designed for typification and representation, was not understood by the less educated German public, and therefore remained unsuccessful. Abel Seyler, the de facto leader of the Hamburg National Theatre and principal of the Seyler Theatre Company It was only with Conrad Ekhof and other well-known traveling actors of the time that a certain, self-developed, realism and a beginning of ensemble performance gradually developed in the middle and at the end of the 18th century. In addition, during the same period, the first national theatres were established with fixed theatrical ensembles, in which most of the German travelling troupes rose to prominence over time. By \\"national\\" one meant a cultural, linguistic commonality in the German-speaking area, which was still fragmented by parochialism. The privately financed Hamburgische Entreprise, where Gotthold Ephraim Lessing worked as dramaturge, was only able to survive between 1767 and 1769, but by the end of the 1820s, there were already over 65 regularly-recorded theatres in the German-speaking area.Simon Williams: German Actors of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. = 19th century = The distinction between drama, opera and ballet groups was still fluid in the 19th century. The composer Albert Lortzing began, for example, as an actor and singer in the Josef Derossi group. The theatre composer Adolf M√ºller (senior) also began his career as a travelling actor. Richard Wagner did not seem to be an actor like his siblings (though he was obliged to take part in the ballet in his first contract as a chordirigent in W√ºrzburg), but he was still engaged with a travelling troupe in the 1830s in Bad Lauchst√§dt. Due to the expansion of the cities in the 19th century, the need for entertainment increased, but the Wanderb√ºhne were pushed back. Fixed theatres, modeled on the Parisian Boulevard theaters, were founded like the K√∂nigsst√§dtisches Theater Berlin. In this transitional period, the poet and actor Karl von Holtei describes the decline of the wandering troops in his novel Der letzte Kom√∂diant (1863). When, in the German-speaking area, audiences were being entertained by the comedy Raub der Sabinerinnen in 1884, the Wanderb√ºhne had already disappeared. = 20th century = As a result of the theatrical low-brow in music halls or singing halls, and with the spread of the boulevard piece and operetta, a new kind of mostly individual, but often multi-disciplinary, actor has emerged since the end of the 19th century. Helmut Qualtinger portrayed this type of performer with his cabaret Der Menschheit W√ºrde ist in eure Hand gegeben (based on Friedrich Schiller's poem ‚ÄòThe Artists‚Äô) ‚Äì in which two small-scale actors discuss their stage roles during the period of National Socialism in the German-speaking theatres of Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe.  Social standing  = Professionalisation = Every performance is an artistic self-promotion [...]. Self-promotion from the instinct of play or from ideological, even from religious or educational vocations, seemed allowed and even in many respects it seemed to be desired. Self-promotion as a profession, on the other hand, daily self-surrender against payment - for amusement or for a tragic sensation for the sake of other spectators - appeared at first to be questionable and beyond all moral norms. So much so that the members of early actor-class were often denied the essential sacraments and refused a proper Christian burial. Jede schauspielerische Leistung ist eine k√ºnstlerische Selbstpreisgabe [‚Ä¶]. Selbstpreisgabe aus Spieltrieb oder aus weltanschaulicher, gar aus religi√∂ser oder aus p√§dagogischer Berufung schien erlaubt und sogar in vieler Hinsicht erw√ºnscht. Selbstpreisgabe als Beruf hingegen, Selbstpreisgabe gegen Entgelt ‚Äì um der Belustigung oder um tragischer Sensationswirkungen vor t√§glich anderen Zuschauern willen ‚Äì erschien zun√§chst als so fragw√ºrdig, als so jenseits allerseelisch-sittlichen Normen, da√ü man die Angeh√∂rigen dieses fr√ºhen Schauspielerstandes vielfach weder zu den wesentlichsten Sakramenten zulie√ü noch ihnen ein christliches Begr√§bnis g√∂nnte. [Every performance is an artistic self-promotion [...]. Self-promotion from the instinct of play or from ideological, even from religious or educational vocations, seemed allowed and even in many respects it seemed to be desired. Self-promotion as a profession, on the other hand, daily self-surrender against payment - for amusement or for a tragic sensation for the sake of other spectators - appeared at first to be questionable and beyond all moral norms. So much so that the members of early actor-class were often denied the essential sacraments and refused a proper Christian burial.] In addition, the traveller‚Äôs existence of the stood in contradiction of the bourgeois ideal of sedentariness, which is why actors enjoyed a bad reputation. Thus, actors were generally regarded as tricksters and as failures with hedonistic lifestyles. As a rule, they had to be buried outside the cemetery walls. Conrad Ekhof (1720‚Äì1778) This changed only with the theatre reforms in the first half of the 18th century. They sought to respect the theatrical actors as artists and thus to raise the demands on the educational level of the actor-class. The actors came to a large extent from acting families, but also increasingly from circles with some education; for example, students ‚Äì since reading was an important basic requirement of the profession. In addition, efforts were made to counteract the bad reputation of actors by way of leading more decent and more moral lives. The actors were only successful in improving their standing as valued artists much later than musicians. .Hermann Schwedes: Musikanten und Com√∂dianten ‚Äì eines ist Pack wie das andere. It was also the travelling actors themselves who sought to improve the artistic and social prestige of the drama and of its standing. They thus decisively contributed to the development of German theatre and a \\"German\\" culture, which, after the wars of liberation, led to an increase in urban and national theatres. The acting troupes were also the first commissioners to employ the young German dramaturges (such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing) and thus helped the German- language drama to have its breakthrough. Finally, the first professional actors emerged from the travelling troupes, which laid the foundations for today's theatre culture in Germany. = Female actors = William Hoarth: Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn Die Neuberin (Neuer Theater-Almanach, 1898) Until the 18th century, women's roles were still played by men. Under Magister Velthen, the first actresses were employed in Germany. To show that they were suited to being an actor, the women also appeared in male roles. The costumes of the ladies were the most expensive, of those needed by a travelling troupe. Therefore, some actresses were engaged because of the wardrobe that they were able to provide. In the 18th and 19th centuries, individual actresses successfully managed a remarkable social rise, whether that involved marrying admirers from upper-classes, or becoming Prinzpals and dramatists themselves. The first woman to become Prinzipal was Catharina Elisabeth Velten after the death of her husband. Prinzipal Friederike Caroline Neuber has the reputation of having banished Hanswurst from the German stage (although she only managed to suppress him partially because, for economic reasons, she could not do without the character in her own group). In 1753, she founded the first German actors' academy and was involved in the beginnings of the Hamburg National Theater (1767-1769). As an actress, director, Prinzipal and dramatist, Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer also had a significant influence on the German-speaking theatre scene in the first half of the 19th century.

Biography Davey was born in 1882 in Nuriootpa, South Australia, to Emily Mary (n√©e Roberts) and Stephen Henry Davey. She began teaching at a Port Adelaide private school in 1908 and at St Peter's Collegiate Girls' School in 1909. She attended the University of Adelaide as a part-time student, completing a B.A. in philosophy in 1915 and an M.A. in 1918. In 1921 she won a Catherine Helen Spence Memorial Scholarship which allowed her to undertake a doctorate at the University of London; her main area of research was \\"mental efficiency and deficiency\\" in children. She received her doctorate in 1924 and visited the United States and Canada to observe the teaching of intellectually disabled and delinquent children before returning to Australia. Constance Davey's plaque on the Jubilee 150 Walkway in Adelaide In November 1924 Davey was hired as the first psychologist in the South Australian Department of Education, where she was tasked with examining and organising classes for \\"backward, retarded and problem\\" school students. She examined and performed intelligence tests on all educationally delayed children, and established South Australia's first \\"opportunity class\\" for these children in 1925. She set up a course which educated teachers on working with intellectually disabled children in 1931. She began lecturing in psychology at the University of Adelaide in 1927, continuing until 1950, and in 1938 she helped to set up a new university course for training social workers. She resigned from the Department of Education in 1942, by which point there were 700 children in the opportunity classes she had introduced.

It was subsequently the home of the Canadian explorer Mina Hubbard and her husband, and later of the actor Tom Conti and his wife. History The house was designed and built in 1902‚Äì1903 for the academic and mathematician William Garnett, in a mixture of styles that include Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau and Scottish Baronial. It was inspired by Garnett's love of Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky poem, \\"Twas brillig, and the slithy toves/Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:/All mimsy were the borogoves,/And the mome raths outgrabe.\\" In 1913, Garnett sold the house to the Yorkshire industrialist, Harold Ellis, and his Canadian explorer wife Mina Benson Hubbard. Hubbard was an advocate of women's suffrage and their guests at the house included the leading suffrage campaigner Emmeline Pankhurst, Isadora Duncan who gave a dance performance there to raise funds for the cause, George Bernard Shaw, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. The house was converted into flats in the 1950s. The photographer Harrison Marks and his partner the nude model Pamela Green lived in one of the flats. The house was restored to a single dwelling in 1985 after it was purchased by the actor Tom Conti and his wife Kara Wilson. In May 2015, The Wabe has been listed for sale, following a protracted dispute with Conti's neighbour, the former footballer Thierry Henry. In 2015, Conti commented that \\"this used to be a wonderful place to live, but in the past ten years there's been endless, endless building.\\" Henry had obtained planning permission to demolish his house and build a new one, including a aquarium spanning four floors.. But he also remarked \\"‚ÄúIt becomes silly as I sit here looking at my vast heating bills. So we are downsizing\\", and denied Henry was a reason he would sell. In late 2018 the house was sold to filmmaker Tim Burton for ¬£11million.https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/property/tom- conti-sells-stunning-london-home-to-tim-burton-at-a-huge-discount/13/01/ References Houses completed in 1903 Houses in Hampstead Arts and Crafts architecture in London ","title":"The Wabe"},{"id":"53738131","text":"John McKay was a Scottish football player during the mid 1950s.

It is located about West Southwest of Marble Bar and Southwest of Port Hedland and 157 km Southeast of Karratha in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The station was established in 1882 by W.A. and W.E. Robinson, who selected of land just north of Mount Margaret in the Hamersley Range. The property is named because it was on a long flat hill and from the initials of the younger Robinson's fiancee, MF (Mary Francis). The homestead was built in the 1890s. The oldest block in the complex was demolished owing to extensive termite damage. The homestead is a group of buildings arranged about a forecourt and set on different levels as they ascend the lower slope of the high hill to the south east. In 1903 the property was acquired by John Church, who later was elected as the member for Roebourne. It remained in his possession until his death in 1937.

Florida voters chose ten representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Florida was won by Columbia University President Dwight D. Eisenhower (R‚ÄìKansas), running with Senator Richard Nixon, with 54.99% of the popular vote, against Adlai Stevenson (D‚ÄìIllinois), running with Senator John Sparkman, with 44.97% of the popular vote. In contrast to Herbert Hoover's anti-Catholicism-driven victory in the state in 1928, Eisenhower's victory was entirely concentrated in the newer and more liberal South Florida counties, which had seen extensive Northern settlement since the war, did not have a history of slave-based plantation farming,Strong, Donald S.; 'The Presidential Election in the South, 1952'; The Journal of Politics, vol. 17, no. 3, pp. 343-389 and saw Eisenhower as more favourable to business than the Democratic Party.See Doherty, Herbert J.

The university claimed to be devoted to preparing and educating students from across the globe to become professional doctors, but has been named as part of an international medical school scam. Both Dr. Rap and Mr. Dalchand have been arrested and charged before the Magistrates Court at District C in Barbados. Both are charged that they defrauded Casa Grande Hotel in St Philip; Furniture Ltd and Builders Mart. These are all businesses owned Mrs Ram Merchandani the owner of Casa Grande Hotel; the campus of the University. The charges arose when cheques tendered for services by these companies were dishonoured by the bank. The sums of monies are in excess of $300000.00 BDS. Both men are remanded in prison in Barbados awaiting hearing. They are set to reappear on Monday 22 September 2018.  Courses  Washington University of Barbados is one of the few universities that implements the elements for USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination) within its curriculum. = Basic science = During 5 trimesters, students will be introduced to the fundamental knowledge and skills of Preclinical Medicine and USMLE Step I Course. The core subjects are Physiology, Biochemistry, Medical Pathology and Anatomy. Basic Science program is designed to meet the health care needs of the society and lasts two years. = Pre-medical sciences = Pre-medical Science is made available to students who have completed twelve years of study but need to obtain 120 credits to qualify for medical school. It includes Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Advanced Biology, Biochemistry and Community Medicine are introduced later in the program to provide students with a head start for USMLE preparation. The timeline of the course is two years. Additionally many of the students at this university have not taken the NEET examination in India. This examination is compulsory for any Indian national wishing to study the MBBS programme. These students in an effort to avoid this examination ran abroad to study. Herein lies the opportunity that fostered this fraudulent medical school. = Clinical rotations = Clinical Rotations are taught over a period of two years in the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. The subjects include Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery and OB/GYN. Students who successfully complete these courses are then eligible to take elective rotations of clinical disciplines.  Campus  The campus is 2,000 square meters with a 400-seat auditorium. It features a library, fitness center, student lounge, onsite dining and banking. There are computer labs and 19 classrooms.  Accommodation  Students expected access to one of 100 units with en-suite bathroom for students living on campus. The occupancy for these rooms are 5 students per room. Each room is equipped with internet. There are 30 additional units for off-campus living, only 5-minutes walking distance from the campus. All off-campus units are available to students at an affordable rate and include a bed, internet connection, Direct-TV, A/C, en-suite bathroom, large and small kitchen appliances. However, they were hosted at the Casa Grande Hotel, previously under fire for its treatment of Nigerian students, and were without water or electricity for at least 5 months. Accreditation Washington University of Barbados remains unaccredited by the Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (CAAM-HP), the United States Department of Education's National Committee on Foreign Medical Education Accreditation (NCFMEA), or any other body empowered to certify medical schools in the region. It had claimed to be recognised by the Ministry of Health Barbados, FAIMER Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research, WHO World Health Organization, IMED International Medical Education Directory and MCI Medical Council of India, Ministry of Education, Government of Barbados, Global Alliance For Medical Education (GAME), Canadian Association for Medical Education (CAME), Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE), World Federation for Medical Education (WFME), International Association of Medical Science Educators (IAMSE), Australian and New Zealand Association for Health Professional Educators (ANZAHPE), Association of Standardized Patient Educators(ASPE), Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN), World Medical Association (WMA). Medical program Washington University of Barbados offers a 4-year Doctor of Medicine (MD) program for college graduates and a 5.5 years Doctor of Medicine (MD) program for high school graduates which includes Pre-medical program, Basic Sciences Program, and Clinical Rotations/Sciences. The Pre-Medical and the Basic Sciences program is taught at WUB, Barbados, and Clinical Rotations are practiced either at WUB, Barbados or in the USA. Washington University of Barbados accepts students internationally three times per year: January, May, and September. Students are required to take the MCAT to study at WUB. The students at WUB attend all portions of the USMLE United States Medical Licensing Examination, with practicing in the USA is the main end goal. Legal troubles Police escorted chief executive officer of the Washington University of Barbados, Gopi Venkat off the University's premises on the 5th of October 2018. This action occurred just after a meeting with officials from the welfare and labour departments along with the Ministry of Education. Minister of Elder Affairs and People Empowerment Cynthia Forde confirmed to NationNews that the authorities were looking into the matter and conducting their own fact checking. Earlier that week some students took their plight to the Ministry of Education. After hearing their concerns Prime Minister Mia Mottley instructed a team to investigate the living conditions. Initial investigations revealed that the electricity and the water were off for the past five months among other issues. Forde gave the assurance that Government would be looking into how best they could assist the students.

One to four players traverse levels set in Egypt, Greece, and on the Moon, collecting weapons to be used against waves of enemies placed throughout the open areas. Character upgrades can be purchased using stars that are obtained through exploration or gaining experience points by killing enemies. Deathmatch and survival modes can be played with up to twelve players. Revealed in December 2014, Bogus Detour was developed by Crackshell after designer Jochum Skoglund added an Easter egg of an enemy from Serious Sam to the studio's previous game, Hammerwatch. Through communication Roman Ribariƒá of Serious Sam franchise owner Croteam, Crackshell was allowed the use of Serious Sam assets and later the rights to develop a full game in Serious Sam series. Crackshell initially intended to self-publish Bogus Detour but later partnered with Devolver Digital to formally announce the game in April 2017 and release it in June for Linux and Microsoft Windows. Bogus Detour received positive reviews, with critics praising the translation of the Serious Sam series to the twin-stick shooter genre, the graphics, and the music, while the progression system received mixed responses. The game sold poorly and failed to recoup development costs by December 2017. Crackshell, in conjunction with cracker Voksi, created a free version of the game in March 2018 to be pirated to entice those players to purchase the game.  Gameplay  Sam fighting off a wave of marines and Kleer skeletons Serious Sam's Bogus Detour is a twin-stick shooter. The player controls Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone through ten open levels, distributed among three thematic places: Egypt, Greece, and the Moon. Enemies of various types are placed around each level and mostly attack in waves, sometimes alongside bosses. The player character can use weapons, by default brandishing two pistols with unlimited ammunition. Further weapons and their ammunition are scattered throughout each level. There are a total of eight weapon types, each with multiple variations, that can be selected from a weapon wheel. The player can obtain stars by gathering experience points through killing enemies. These stars can be used to purchase character upgrades, such as an improvement movement speed or increased rate of fire. Stars are also hidden within levels, alongside other secrets. Some areas can only be accessed by obtaining keycards or breaking destructible walls. Enemies and hazards, such as toxic waste, inflict damage on the character. Depleting the character's health causes them to lose a life, of which they initially have three. After losing all lives, gameplay stops and the player is stripped of all weapons and upgrades. Bogus Detour has multiple difficulty settings, as well as \\"switches\\" that allow altering specific gameplay elements, such as granting the character unlimited ammunition or disabling the heads-up display. The game can be played cooperatively with up to four players, either online or locally in split-screen. Up to twelve online players can compete in head-to-head deathmatch gameplay or a cooperative survival mode. Additional levels can be created using the built-in level editor and shared via the Steam Workshop.  Development and release  Serious Sam's Bogus Detour was developed by Crackshell, a Swedish indie game studio founded by former Overkill Software developers. It was the studio's second game after Hammerwatch. Crackshell's designer, Jochum \\"Hipshot\\" Skoglund, enjoyed referencing old media he liked in his games, so the team added the Beheaded Kamikaze, an enemy from the Serious Sam series, as an Easter egg to the Hammerwatch expansion Temple of the Sun, which was released in September 2014. Considering to turn the Easter egg official, Skoglund got in contact with Roman Ribariƒá, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Serious Sam franchise owner Croteam, through friends at the studios Skoglund had previously worked for. Ribariƒá had played and enjoyed Hammerwatch, and gave Crackshell free reign to use Serious Sam multimedia assets for their endeavour. He was also fond of the resulting crossover, and while talking about it, Skoglund asked whether he could pitch a game idea to Croteam. Subsequently, he and an artist at Crackshell created a tech demo titled \\"2D, Seriously?\\", featuring Sam seen from a top-down view with rough environment details. Other working titles included \\"Serious Top-Down\\" and \\"Serious Sam 2D\\". Skoglund sent a screenshot of the demo to Ribariƒá while working on it, who \\"loved it\\" and provided Crackshell with a contract to develop a full game based on it. Crackshell's Niklas \\"Myran\\" Myrberg created a proprietary game engine (later named A000FF) with a level editor using C++ and AngelScript, improving on issues the team had faced with the C#-based engine he had developed for Hammerwatch. Rotating sprites for weapons were created in 3D using Autodesk Maya and then rendered in 2D at sixteen angles. Skoglund devised the plot after reading through the synopses of previous Serious Sam games, settling on a diversion during the story of Serious Sam: The First Encounter. He chose to also include characters from other Serious Sam games, such as the alien marines featured in Serious Sam 2. He noted that the Serious Sam series had a lot of hardcore fans, especially \\"older gamers\\" in Eastern Europe, which made it pleasant to fill Bogus Detour with references to previous games. Skoglund thought it was fun to work on a third-party intellectual property (IP) and to have access to all Serious Sam and The Talos Principle assets, including audio, visuals and the Serious Engine. He liked how material and ideas from The Talos Principle, which originated as an experiment during the development of Serious Sam 4, could be used in a Serious Sam project. Skoglund wanted to show Croteam that Crackshell had taken the project seriously and wanted to deliver a good take on the series that felt substantial. He hoped to be able to use the game to get to work on other IPs he had been a fan of, such as Syndicate. Skoglund revealed Bogus Detour through the forum of TIGSource in December 2014, saying that the studio intended to self-publish the game in 2016. The Crackshell team, which spanned five members in May 2016, shared development updates on TIGSource and later through Twitter and YouTube. In April 2017, Devolver Digital, which had since become the game's publisher, released a first trailer for the game. Bogus Detour was exhibited at the E3 game conference in early June 2017. It was released on 20 June 2017 for Linux and Microsoft Windows through the Steam and GOG.com storefronts. The game is considered part of the Serious Sam Indie Series, which also included Serious Sam Double D and Serious Sam: The Random Encounter. Multiple patches released until August 2017 fixed bugs and added features like split-screen functionality. The game's soundtrack, composed by Damjan Mravunac, was released to YouTube in July 2017.  Reception  Serious Sam's Bogus Detour received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to review aggregator website Metacritic, which calculated a normalised rating of 76/100 based on twelve critic reviews. James Cunningham of Hardcore Gamer opined that the game was a \\"perfect\\" translation of the Serious Sam franchise to the twin-stick shooter genre. Clotaire Jacquier of Jeuxvideo.com felt that the top-down view complemented the series' DNA and that the game was a \\"successful mix\\" between the series and the genre. Enrique Garcia of Vandal stated that, although Bogus Detour was neither perfect nor innovative within its genre and mechanics, the game respected all common elements of a Serious Sam game. In a 2020 retrospective on the Serious Sam series, Jonathan Kaharl of Hardcore Gaming 101 said that Bogus Detour was \\"easily the best of the Serious Sam spin-offs\\". Cunningham lauded the game's \\"gorgeous\\" pixel art as \\"well detailed and animated\\". Jose A. Rodr√≠guez, writing for IGNs Spanish outlet, called it a \\"work of art\\" and cited satisfaction in gradually distributing enemies' remains on the levels' floors. Garcia also liked the \\"retro-style\\" visuals, while Jacquier labelled the graphical and musical presentation as solid. According to Rodr√≠guez, the music and sound well underlined the gameplay. Also noted positively were the difficulty, exploration rewards, and multiplayer, although Jacquier was disappointed by the scarcity of online players at the time of his review. Rodr√≠guez considered the progression system the best part of the game, while Jacquier criticised it as unclear and laborious. Jacquier faced some irritation when tracking long distances over empty areas, especially due to Sam's initially slow pace. Rodr√≠guez found that the small size of the player character could cause disorientation with numerous elements on-screen, which was amplified when there were multiple players. = Sales = Serious Sam's Bogus Detour sold poorly and had not recouped its development costs by December 2017. Bulgarian cracker Voksi, who was friendly with Crackshell and had tested the beta version of the game, approached the studio in March 2018 with the idea of creating a sanctioned build that could be pirated. This version was distributed through Voksi's forum, Revolt, and prepared with a note asking the player to buy the game to support the developers, though otherwise not obstructing the gameplay.

This site has a church and a huge cross which can be seen from Iloilo City coast and known for being a pilgrimage site of Catholic devotees especially during the Holy Week. It has also a lighthouse serve as a navigational aid for pumpboats and ships. Alongside the trail to the top are 14 stations called \\"Way of the Cross\\", which depicts significant events in the life of Jesus Christ. Catholics visit Balaan Bukid to be reminded of the suffering Jesus gone through to save mankind. History The Ave Maria Shrine in Jordan, Guimaras is popularly known as the Bala-an Bukid, the highest elevation of the headland called by navigators as the Bondolan Point. The shrine includes a chapel and a concrete cross both erected in 1954 during the Marian year celebration on a property donated by the heirs of Don Raymundo Melliza y Angulo, Iloilo's second governor. The construction of the chapel and the cross was financed by Ana Ledesma vda de Lopez and her children Victoria, Eduardo and Cesar \\"in gratitude for Our Lady's protection during the last war.\\" The chapel overlooks the whole of Guimaras and the south eastern coast of Panay. Opposite it is a 60-foot cross erected on a narrow circular gallery that can accommodate about five persons at a time. The shrine, completed in 1956, provides a panoramic view of Jordan and Buenavista, and of Iloilo City across the strait. The Marian year celebration commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Roman Catholic Church's pronouncement of the Virgin Mary's immaculate conception, a dogma proclaimed by Pope Pius IX on 8 December 1854. The shrine was conceived by Mill Hill missionary Virgil Pixner, an Irish priest and chaplain of the Knights of Columbus Iloilo Council No. 3346. Before leaving Panay for another assignment, he entrusted his plan to lawyer Jose Maria Lopez Vito who, along with then Jaro Archbishop Jose Maria Cuenco, looked for donors for the project. Governor Melliza owned a lot of properties in Jordan, particularly in the northern part of Barrio Balcon which was later divided into Balcon Melliza and Balcon Maravilla where the Maravilla family owned most of the land in the south. Bala-an Bukid is in Balcon Melliza. Accessibility On regular days, Balaan Bukid can be accessed by riding a ferry boat bound for Jordan Wharf in Ortiz Port in Iloilo City. From Jordan Wharf, take a tricycle ride to the foot of Balaan Bukid, where you will start your 30min ‚Äì 45 min hike to the top. During the holy week, there are special trips that transport visitors directly to the foot of Balaan Bukid.

Road verge, greenways, backyard and park woody vegetation are at the center of attention for the tree care industry. Landscape architecture and urban forestry also set high demands on professional tree care. High safety standards against the dangers of tree care have helped the industry evolve. Especially felling in space-limited environments poses significant risks: the vicinity of power or telephone lines, insufficient protective gear (against falling dead wood, chainsaw wounds, etc.) and narrow felling zones with endangered nearby buildings, parking cars, etc.. The required equipment and experience usually transcends private means and is often considered too costly as a permanent part of the public infrastructure. In singular cases, traditional tools like handsaws may suffice, but large-scale tree care usually calls for heavy machinery like cranes, bucket trucks,harvesters, and woodchippers. Road side trees are especially prone to biotic stress by exhaust fumes, toxic road debris, soil compaction, and drought which makes them susceptible to fungal infections and various plant pests. When tree removal is not an option, because of road ecology considerations, the main challenge is to achieve road safety (visibility of road signs, blockage-free lanes, etc.) while maintaining tree health. Tuesday, 20 October 2020 Tree removal While the perceived risk of death by falling trees (a part of the \\"tree risk\\" complex) is influenced by media and often hyped (the objective risk has been reported to be close to 1 : 10.000.000, almost as low as death by lightning),http://environmentalpartnership.org/environmentalpartnership.org/media/Documents/Jaroslav- Kolarik_res.pdf singular events have encouraged a \\"proactive\\" stance so that even lightly damaged trees are likely to be removed in urban and public traffic surroundings. As a tree ages and nears the end of its safe useful life expectancy (SULE), it's perceived amenity value is decreased greatly. A risk assessment normally carried out by local council's arborist to determine the best course of action. As with all public green spaces, trees in green urban spaces and their careful conservation is sometimes in conflict with aggressive urban development even though it is often understood how urban trees contribute to liveability of suburbs and cities both objectively (reduction of urban heat island effect, etc.) and subjectively. Tree planting programs implemented by a growing number of cities, local councils and organizations is mitigating the losses and in most cases increasing the number of trees in suburbia. Programs include the planting of 2 trees for every 1 tree removed, while some councils are paying land owners to keep trees instead of removing them for farming or construction. Standards =USA= The voluntary industry consensus standards developed by TCIA, resulted in the ANSI A300 standard, the generally accepted industry standard for tree care practices including trees, shrubs, and other woody plants.

Olivedale Farms 2017 _Establishment of the Farming District_ The Trek Boers started expanding from the Cape Colony and the governing body of the VOC in the early 1700s. The first farm to be established in the wider Swellendam/Buffeljags area was Jan Harmse in 1723 (now Nooitgedacht) and Roelof Olofsz at Grootvadersbosch. In 1731 Andre Schutte established himself at Potteberg and Dirk Cornelius Uys was the first Farmer in Bufflejagsriver. Reasons for leaving the secure vicinity of Cape Town and Stellenbosch included the need for independence from the VOC. Until 1743 the farmers from the \\"verre afgeleegene districten\\" (as it was known by the VOC) lived very much in isolation as the nearest church and landdrost from Olivedale, Buffeljagsriver, was in Stellenbosch, which was not only a far way to travel but also very dangerous.

He inspected the \\"Colonie in de verre afgeleegene districten\\" and recommended that it must be proclaimed as a district under the VOC. So the nearby town of Swellendam was born. Olivedale, Buffeljagsrivier district was mainly livestock based including cattle and fat tailed sheep, which were later cross bred with Spanish Marinos to produce wool for export. As early as 1803 the Buffeljagsriver area was known for the pure bred horses. Landdrost Faure owned a pure bred horse farm, named Rotterdam.

It can include curiosity about such things as what objects are composed of, the underlying mechanisms of systems, mathematical relationships, languages, social norms, and history. It can be differentiated from another type of curiosity that does not lead to acquisition of general knowledge, such as curiosity about the intimate secrets of other people. It is a facet of openness to experience in the Five Factor Model used to describe human personalities.Costa, P. T. & McCrae, R. R. (1992). NEO personality Inventory professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources. It is similar to need for cognition and typical intellectual engagement. History In antiquity, the Roman philosopher Cicero wrote about our innate love of learning: In 1738, the Scottish philosopher David Hume differentiated intellectual curiosity from a more primitive form of curiosity: Later, in 1954, Berlyne differentiated it into perceptual curiosity and epistemic curiosity, and in 2004 a psychometric scale to assess epistemic and perceptual curiosity was developed. Intellectual development in children Humans seem to be born with intellectual curiosity, but depending on how parents react to questions from their children, intellectual curiosity might be increased or decreased. Parents that always react negatively to questions asked by their children, are discouraging them from asking questions, and that is likely to make them less curious. On the other hand, parents that always react positively to questions asked by their children, are encouraging them to ask questions, and that is likely to make them more curious. There is a book about how to foster intellectual curiosity and a love for knowledge in children. Academic performance It has been positively correlated with academic performance (0.20), together with general intelligence (0.35) and conscientiousness (0.20). Scientific progress Toby E. Huff has argued that the European civilization had a high level of intellectual curiosity during the scientific revolution. He also argues that other civilizations have had a high level of intellectual curiosity in their most progressive stages. Neurobiological basis The temporal lobe is involved in understanding. Intellectual curiosity might be regarded as the trait that motivates growth of understanding in the temporal lobe. Motivation is effectuated by the neurotransmitter dopamine Similarity to other concepts Due to a high level of correlation (.78), it has been argued that need for cognition and typical intellectual engagement basically are measuring the same trait. Intellectual curiosity might be regarded as an umbrella term for these two traits.

He was awarded a Michelin star at The Paul (da) and , has two stars at Henne Kirkeby Kro. Early life and training Cunningham was born and grew up in rural Essex. He first worked as a cook in a country pub in Widdington and then in various restaurants and country house hotels, including Danesfield House and Lords of the Manor, before moving to Denmark in 1994. Career In Denmark Cunningham started as fish cook and became head chef at S√∏ller√∏d Kro, which during his time there acquired one of the first Michelin stars awarded in the country, then at , where he trained , and at Coquus and Plaza before becoming co-owner and chef at The Paul, located in Glassalen, the glass pavilion at Tivoli in Copenhagen. Refslund followed him when he left Formel B, becoming his assistant at The Paul before leaving for Noma. The park had had a reputation for poor food; at The Paul, Cunningham became a celebrity chef, cooking for Margrethe II of Denmark, Helena Christensen, and for Bill Clinton, Paris Hilton and Metallica when they visited Denmark. The restaurant was awarded a Michelin star in 2003, nine months after opening. After the restaurant suffered from the financial crisis and after being hospitalised in spring 2011 with a stress-related condition and refused reduced hours by Tivoli management, Cunningham closed The Paul late that year. He then in 2012 succeeded Allan Poulsen as chef at Henne Kirkeby Kro, an eighteenth-century inn (kro) in , a village in Varde Municipality. Henne Kirkeby Kro was awarded its first Michelin star in 2016 and a second in 2017. Cunningham was invited to open Noma but declined, suggesting Ren√© Redzepi. At previous restaurants, Cunningham's cooking used precision techniques such as molecular cuisine; at Henne Kirkeby Kro he announced that he would make use of the restaurant's kitchen garden‚Äîthe largest in Denmark‚Äîand access to the coast and fresh fish to perform \\"intuitive\\", jazz-inspired cooking. He has said that his cooking is not Nordic cuisine as such: that he is \\"an incorrigible Francophile\\" and \\"[has] travelled too much to say no to Pakistani mangoes or galangal\\". He decides everything about the menu, which he has called \\"a gastronome's Russian roulette\\"; it \\"may consist of anything from pig ears with oyster aioli to duck decorated with marigolds\\" and emphasises the fresh ingredients. Cunningham is a member of a chef's collective called Gelinaz! He has also won the Danish hot-dog championship three times. Publications , Cunningham has published eight cookery books. Private life Cunningham lives in Kors√∏r with his wife, Lene, and children, currently spending half the week there because of the distance from Henne Kirkeby, and is active as a photographer. He says that he cannot work without music.

Aliprandi received good critical reviews for La ragazza, as well as for his next two films‚Äî1974's Corruzione al palazzo di giustizia (Corruption at the Palace of Justice, released in the United States as Smiling Maniacs) and 1976's Un sussurro nel buio (A Whisper in the Dark). But only one of the three, Smiling Maniacs, was a commercial success. Aliprandi's last film in the 1970s, Senza buccia (Skin Deep) (1979), was both a critical and commercial failure. For the entire 1980s, Aliprandi mostly worked in television and the theater. His television work included the three-part musical Hollywood Hello, qui, Broadway!, which featured choreographer Bob Fosse playing himself (Aliprandi and Fosse had met while Aliprandi was visiting the United States). It also included Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie. The only feature film that Aliprandi made during this period was 1982's Morte in Vaticano (Death in the Vatican). As with his previous feature film, it was a commercial failure. Along with friend Lino Patruno, Aliprandi founded the production company Movietone of Italy in the early 1990s. His final two films were 1992's Prova di Memoria (Memory Test, released in the United States as Crimson Dawn) and 1994's Soldato Ignato (Unknown Soldier). The latter film saw little distribution, being screened only at two film festivals‚Äî one in Italy and the other at Brazil's Festival de Gramado. For the Italian screening, Aliprandi's directing credit was given as \\"Daniel Ford\\". In assessing Aliprandi's career, film historian Roberto Curti noted that his early association with Visconti lent Aliprandi a certain level of respect within the Italian film industry. However, he also noted that Aliprandi never achieved great critical success. Curti attributed this largely to Aliprandi's directorial style, which he described as \\"often too weird and artistically compromised\\". He added that, except for Senza buccia (Skin Deep), Aliprandi's films were \\"personal and technically competent\\" and dealt with fantasy elements in ways that were \\"original and idiosyncratic\\".

It was written by Steven Moffat, directed by Rachel Talalay, and was broadcast on 24 June 2017 on BBC One. The episode received overwhelmingly positive reviews from television critics. In the episode, the Doctor (Peter Capaldi), Bill (Pearl Mackie), Nardole (Matt Lucas), and Missy (Michelle Gomez) answer a distress call from a gigantic ship trying to escape a black hole. It is the first episode of a two-part story which concludes in the following episode, \\"The Doctor Falls\\". \\"World Enough and Time\\" is the first multi-Master episode in the show's televised history, as it features both Missy, the character's latest incarnation, and an earlier version (John Simm) last seen in the 2009‚Äì2010 serial \\"The End of Time\\". It also serves as an origin story for the Cybermen, and features the return of the original Mondasian Cybermen, last seen on-screen in the 1966 serial The Tenth Planet, which was the Cybermen's debut. Synopsis In the cold open, the Twelfth Doctor emerges from the TARDIS onto a snowscape and collapses, beginning to regenerate. Earlier, the Doctor proposed to test Missy's atonement by having her, alongside Bill and Nardole, answer a distress call. They arrive via the TARDIS on a giant colony ship reversing away from a black hole. They are held at gunpoint by the solitary crew member, Jorj, who demands to know which of them is human, fearing creatures that are arriving by the lift. Bill admits to being human and Jorj shoots her out of fear. Humanoid figures, wearing cloth masks and hospital gowns, take Bill's body away claiming they can restore her. Right before the lifts depart, the Doctor telepathically tells Bill to wait for him. The Doctor, Missy, and Nardole learn from Jorj that, two days previously, some of the human bridge crew had gone down to the lower level of the ship to start the engine reversal, but they never returned. Jorj claims the ship only had 50 people two days ago, but Nardole shows there are actually thousands of life forms below. They are the descendants of the crew: due to time dilation from the black hole, time moves faster at the ship's lower levels (further from the black hole) than the bridge (close to the black hole) 400 miles away, and a year has already passed for Bill. The Doctor incapacitates Jorj and, along with Missy and Nardole, departs below in a lift. Another of the patients waiting to be \\"upgraded\\", on display at a Doctor Who exhibition. Bill awakens in a hospital, where she finds that she has been fitted with a mechanical device that serves as her replacement heart. Razor, one of the hospital's employees, shows her around and explains that some of the patients are waiting to be \\"upgraded\\" for \\"Operation Exodus\\", to escape the polluted air of the ship's lower levels due to contamination from the fuel. Years later, they see footage from the bridge of the Doctor coming down the lift. However, Razor then tricks Bill into becoming the next \\"upgrade\\" subject. Upon arriving, the Doctor and Nardole explore the hospital while Missy tries to determine the origin of the colony ship. She finds the vessel is from a \\"twin\\" of Earth, Mondas. Razor approaches her and insists she has been here before, and that the Doctor will never forgive her for what has happened to Bill. When she denies it, \\"Razor\\" removes his disguise, revealing himself to be the Master (as played by John Simm), Missy's earlier incarnation. The Doctor and Nardole find an operating theatre where a \\"Mondasian\\" Cyberman, from when the Doctor first encountered them, emerges from a closet. The Cyberman identifies itself as formerly being Bill Potts. The Master and Missy then explain they are all witnessing the genesis of the Cybermen. The Cyberman tells the Doctor \\"I waited for you\\", revealing that Bill is the Cyberman; underneath its face cover, Bill sheds a tear. This episode featured the return of the original Mondasian Cybermen, not seen since 1966 in The Tenth Planet. They are shown here at a Doctor Who exhibition. =Continuity= Bill is converted into a Cyberman matching the original design from the 1966 serial The Tenth Planet. The Doctor performs Venusian aikido on Jorj, a specialty of the Third Doctor that he first demonstrated in The Green Death (originally called \\"Venusian karate\\" in Inferno). The Master says that he loves disguises, a fondness which dates back to his debut appearance in Terror of the Autons when he posed as a telephone engineer. He also mentions being \\"someone's former Prime Minister\\"; the Master was elected Prime Minister during \\"The Sound of Drums\\" / \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", under the alias Harold Saxon. =Outside references= The episode's title comes from the Andrew Marvell poem \\"To His Coy Mistress\\": \\"Had we but world enough and time, / This coyness, lady, were no crime.\\"  Production  The read-through for this episode took place on 21 February 2017, and the main shooting was from 24 February through 28 March. On 6 March 2017, it was announced the original Mondasian Cybermen from The Tenth Planet would be returning for the finale of the tenth series. =Casting= On 6 April 2017, the BBC confirmed that Simm would be returning as the Master in the tenth series, appearing alongside his successor in the role, Michelle Gomez, for the first story in the programme's history with more than one incarnation of the Master at the same time. Broadcast and reception The episode was watched by 3.37 million viewers overnight, one of the lowest ratings for the series. However, compared to other programmes that aired on the same night, Doctor Who fared relatively well with a share of 22%. The episode received 5.00 million views overall, and it received an Appreciation Index of 85, the joint highest score of Twelfth Doctor episodes along with \\"Dark Water\\" from the eighth series. = Critical reception = \\"World Enough and Time\\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from television critics, with many of them hailing it the best episode of the tenth series, but also criticizing the BBC for spoiling the cliffhanger early on. The episode currently holds an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, the website's consensus reading, \\"'World Enough and Time' sets up the conclusion of Doctor Whos tenth season with a cliffhanger episode that deftly blends many of the show's most important ingredients.\\" Bradley Russell from SFX Magazine gave the episode a rating of 4 stars out of 5. Stating that the episode was about \\"playing with expectation\\", he stated that the episode was the regular mix of science-fiction scares and horror, but that everything felt very slightly out of place. He did, however, compliment the ending of the episode and how it gave more ample motivation to watch the finale episode. He stated that the opening scene of the regeneration was a \\"cheap tactic\\" with no answers given, but the idea of Missy filling the Doctor's shoes was far more interesting. He also stated that some scenes were \\"bordering on unwatchable for young children\\" and \\"too slow and filled with exposition\\". Scott Collura of IGN gave the episode a 9.0, admiring the character development of Missy through the episode, as she is finally depicted as \\"out and about as the Mistress\\", and how Steven Moffat does a good job of deconstructing the name and meaning of the show. He went on to praise \\"World Enough and Time\\" as a great buildup for the season finale, noting that \\"like the Master and Missy themselves, this episode is sort of a two-faced monster ‚Äì but a good one that seems to be bringing the tenth season to a strong finish\\". He stated that the episode was full of great science-fiction concepts, high stakes for all of the main and supporting characters, and how the episode was full of \\"humor, scares, and more\\". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine was also extremely positive about the episode, praising Steven Moffat's writing and the script's cleverness, but also indicating that it was easy to see through the disguise of John Simm since the appearance of the Master had been spoiled early on: \\"Who'd have guessed Simm was returning after all these years? Imagine how much more powerful that reveal could've been!\\" He stated that the episode aimed to grab the viewer's attention even before the credits, with the regeneration scene, stating that it was a far better \\"regeneration\\" than the one that had previously appeared in \\"The Lie of the Land\\". He also complimented Rachel Talalay's direction of the episode, after having a track record with Peter Capaldi's series finales. Giving the episode a perfect score, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times called it \\"macabre and riveting\\", stating that the conversion of Bill Potts into the Mondasian Cyberman and the revelation at the end of the episode \\"packed more punch\\" than Jackie Tyler's Cyber-conversion in the second series or Oswin Oswald being revealed as a Dalek in the \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\". Mulkern ended his review with praise towards the cliffhanger ending: \\"The close of World Enough and Time is sublime. Steven Moffat‚Äôs script deftly cuts between two scenes of revelation, expertly shot by director Rachel Talalay.\\"  References  External links  Twelfth Doctor episodes 2017 British television episodes Television episodes written by Steven Moffat The Master (Doctor Who) television stories Cybermen television stories Black holes in fiction ","title":"World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)"},{"id":"53738650","text":"\\"The Doctor Falls\\" is the twelfth and final episode of the tenth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was written by Steven Moffat, directed by Rachel Talalay, and was broadcast on 1 July 2017 on BBC One. It is the second episode of a two-part story, the first part being \\"World Enough and Time\\". The episode received overwhelmingly positive reviews from television critics. As a continuation of the previous episode, \\"The Doctor Falls\\" concludes the first televised multi-Master story of the show, as well as the origin of the Mondasian Cybermen. In the episode, the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) must save himself and the remaining human population of a gigantic colony ship from Mondas, while also dealing with two different incarnations of the Master (Michelle Gomez and John Simm) at once. The episode features a cameo from the First Doctor, now portrayed by David Bradley. He had previously played William Hartnell, the original First Doctor actor, in the 2013 Doctor Who docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time. Synopsis Aboard the colony ship reversing from the event horizon of a black hole, the Twelfth Doctor finds Bill has been converted into a Cyberman. The Master and Missy capture the Doctor, but he had earlier surreptitiously reprogrammed the Cybernet to target Time Lords as well, forcing them to flee. Nardole arrives in a commandeered shuttlecraft to rescue them. The Doctor is electrocuted by a Cyberman, but is saved by Bill. A \\"primitive\\" Cyberman, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition They evacuate to a higher level of the ship containing a solar farm populated by children and a few adults fighting off early Cybermen prototypes. The Doctor recovers, but suppresses the early signs of regeneration. Bill initially remains unaware of her transformation, her strong mind acting like a perception filter, until one of the children inadvertently reveals the truth to her. Bill sheds a tear, which the Doctor calls a hopeful sign. Missy and the Master discover a camouflaged lift, a possible escape route. But when they call for it, an upgraded Cyberman arrives, which the group destroys. The Doctor warns that the time dilation affords the Cybermen more time to evolve and strategize. Nardole discovers the floor directly below the solar farm contains fuel pipes. He is able to trigger controlled explosions, which are used to exaggerate the humans' defensive strength and defeat the Cybermen's initial attack. Knowing this ploy only delays their inevitable defeat, the Doctor instructs Nardole to lead the human community to a solar farm on another floor and remain there to safeguard them. Bill stays to fight with the Doctor. Despite the Doctor's impassioned plea, Missy and the Master abandon them, intending to take the lift to the lowest level and escape in the Master's TARDIS. Missy, however, changes her mind and stabs the Master, which will trigger his next regeneration. He retaliates by shooting her in the back with his laser screwdriver, telling her she will not regenerate. Both laugh over the irony of their mutual betrayal before the Master departs. An army of Cybermen arrive, but are warded off by the Doctor until he falls after being shot. Surrounded, the Doctor ignites all the fuel pipes, engulfing the farm in a fireball and destroying or disabling the Cybermen. The Doctor lies still as Bill kneels beside him. She suddenly finds herself outside of her Cyberman body in her human form. Heather (\\"The Pilot\\") appears, having found Bill through her tears. She saves Bill by transforming her into an entity like herself. They leave the Doctor inside his TARDIS, and Heather invites Bill to explore the universe with her. Bill sheds tears for the Doctor before leaving with Heather. The TARDIS arrives in a snowy landscape and the Doctor awakens, briefly dazed and confused. Refusing to keep continually changing, he emerges and seemingly stops his regeneration. Within, the cloister bell sounds an alarm as the Doctor encounters his original incarnation. =Continuity= Missy mentions that the Doctor once died in a fall, referring to events in Logopolis (1981), in which one of her previous incarnations causes the Fourth Doctor to fall from a radio telescope tower. During the final battle, the Doctor lists the various sites of his encounters with Cybermen: Mondas (The Tenth Planet), Telos (The Tomb of the Cybermen), Planet 14 (The Invasion), Voga (Revenge of the Cybermen), Canary Wharf (\\"Doomsday\\"), and the Moon (The Moonbase). He also mentions Marinus, a reference to the events of Grant Morrison's Sixth Doctor comic The World Shapers, in which that planet's Voord evolve into Cybermen (though that story also suggests that Mondas, Planet 14, and Marinus are all the same planet). =Outside references= Nardole tells the farming community to \\"Remember the Alamo\\" as they shore up the farmhouse's defences. The Alamo Mission was overrun by General Santa Anna's troops in 1836, and \\"Remember the Alamo!\\" became a rallying cry for the independent troops which later defeated the Mexican Army to form the Republic of Texas. Missy calls the human community \\"the Waltons\\", a reference to the American TV series The Waltons, a show about a farming family with several children during the Great Depression.  Production  The read through for this episode took place on 21 February 2017. On 6 March 2017 the BBC stated that the work on the final two episodes of the series had begun, \\"World Enough and Time\\" and this episode, with Rachel Talalay returning to direct her third consecutive series finale. Filming for the episodes and the series as a whole concluded on 7 April 2017. The final scene involving David Bradley was filmed as part of the filming of the Christmas Special in June 2017. =Cast= * David Bradley appears at the episode's conclusion as the First Doctor. Bradley portrayed William Hartnell, the First Doctor's actor, in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time and appeared as the villain Solomon in \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\", as well as voicing the character of Shansheeth Blue in Death of the Doctor in the Doctor Who spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures. * This is the final on-screen appearance of Michelle Gomez as Missy. Since 2018, she has reprised the role for many Doctor Who audio dramas from Big Finish Productions. * John Simm makes his final on-screen appearance as The Master. He will reprise the role in the upcoming audio drama Masterful from Big Finish Productions alongside Gomez as well as Eric Roberts, Derek Jacobi and Geoffrey Beevers. It will be released in 2021. Broadcast and reception The episode was watched by 3.75 million viewers overnight. Compared to other programmes that aired on the same night, Doctor Who fared relatively well with a share of 25.3%. The episode received 5.30 million views overall, and it received an Appreciation Index of 83. = Critical reception = \\"The Doctor Falls\\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews, with most reviewers finding it a fitting end to the tenth series. The episode currently holds a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the site consensus reading \\"'The Doctor Falls' offers a dramatic and satisfying end for this iteration of the show's ever-evolving hero.\\" Praise was directed at Moffat's screenplay, Talalay's direction, and Capaldi's performance. Alasdair Wilkins from The A.V. Club called the episode a \\"perfect finale\\", explaining that the Twelfth Doctor is a Doctor who knows who he is, portrayed by an actor who knows exactly how he wants to play the part of the character, both of which are played into the narrative of the story and blending into the storyline of the Doctor refusing to regenerate. He complimented how the multiple storylines of the series were wrapped up and brought to a satisfying conclusion, as well as respecting the reality of the character's emotions, which were performed with only a couple of small missteps. Scott Collura of IGN also praised the dynamic between the two Masters, describing the relationship as a mixture of a \\"brother-sister and boyfriend-girlfriend\\" relationship and its resultant complexities, and how the intentions of the previous incarnation Master was to draw Missy back into the traditional evil manner of the character. He stated that the story made enough sense that \\"Moffat doesn't really even need to write it on the page\\". He complimented the appearance of David Bradley as the First Doctor, but stated that extending the storyline of the regeneration out over the two episodes of the finale, as well as the Christmas special, was a great concept but did not work in the context of the episode. Giving the episode a perfect score, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times singled out the performances as one of the strong points about the episode, saying that Capaldi, Simm and Gomez worked perfectly well together within the episode. He stated that Capaldi was as magnificent as he had been through the series, and that \\"The Doctor Falls\\" was an episode dedicated to him, and how he \\"stands tall\\" among the competition of Simm's and Gomez's acting. He stated that Simm's Master was not the \\"loon\\" that was portrayed seven years ago, but complimented him nonetheless, and that Gomez's portrayal of Missy and the character's soul-searching was \\"simply superb\\". Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror also gave the episode a perfect score, and felt the episode was an immensely satisfying conclusion with great storytelling and epic performances, stating that with all the teasers, build up and trailers that had been released in preparation for the episode, \\"The Doctor Falls\\" could have resulted in becoming a failure of a series finale, but he complimented how well it turned out. He stated that the episode was an \\"immensely satisfying, packed, heart string tugging\\" conclusion to the series, that was the result of \\"clever storytelling and tremendous acting\\". He stated that Capaldi and his performance in the episode \\"simply shines\\", and that the Twelfth Doctor had never had a better episode through his era. The episode received a nomination in the Best Special and Visual Effects category at the 2019 BAFTA Cymru Awards.
