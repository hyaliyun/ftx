Introduced in 1977, these harvesters marked a departure from traditional combine harvester design, in that threshing and separation was performed mainly by a rotor, as opposed to the drum and straw walker type models used previously. This is shown in the image at right, where the bulk of the processing area is devoted to a cylinder, that spins and threshes grain from the grain heads and allows for far greater capacity than the previous drum and walker design of harvester. This increase in capacity has led to a significant productivity increase of harvesters and therefore farmers who use them. The rotary design by International Harvester was the first of its kind to be mass-produced and its patent over the design gave IH a competitive advantage over its rivals, including John Deere, Massey Ferguson, New Holland and others. Models The following is a summary of the model development of the Case IH harvester to the present day.http://www.toytractorshow.com/ih_conventional_combine_history.htm = The 14 series = International Harvester had launched the 15 series of conventional combine harvesters in 1968. In 1977, after extensive engineering efforts and a bottom up design, IH released the 1440 and 1460 models of harvester. In 1978, the larger model 1480 was released, as well as the specialty models 1470 (for hillside operation), and the 1482, designed to be pulled behind a tractor with PTO capability. Further models were introduced as the series was developed including the 1420 in 1980, = The 16 series = In 1985, International Harvester and Case Corporation merged. The 16 series was the first harvester series released by the new Case International and was an upgrade to the 14 series rather than a replacement. All models of the 14 series had 16 series equivalents, in the 1620, 1640, 1660, 1670, 1680 and 1682. = The 16-4/6/8 series = Released in 1993, the 16 series was again upgraded to the 16-4/6/8 series. Models included the 1644, 1666 and 1688, and incorporated many changes to improve processing capacity. = The 21 series = Tenneco demerged CaseIH in 1995 and the new Case Corporation released the 21 series combine harvesters, comprising the 2144, 2166, 2188. These models represented a significant step forward in the model design featuring improved operator comfort, higher power engines and a range of other productivity and user ease improvements. = The 23 series = Making incremental improvements on the 21 series, the 23 series were quite similar to the 21 series featuring more upgrades to engine power and other improvements to harvester operation. The series featured the 2344, 2366, 2377 and 2388 models. The 2377 was intended to replace the 2366, though the 2366 remained popular. = The 120 series = In 1999, CaseIH and New Holland AG merged to form CNH Global. As part of the post merger product simplification process, both harvester lines of CaseIH and New Holland were based on a common basic platform, with each model then customised to the features usually found on each harvester (e.g. cabin, external panelling, colouring, decals etc.). These combine harvesters are manufactured in Grand Island, Nebraska This series consisted of the 7120, 8120 and 9120 models and were based on a 5.4m2 (7120) and 6.5m2 (8120/9120) cleaning area. Significant improvements were made to the design including replacing many chains and belts with hydraulic control, including the main rotor drive belt. This hydraulic drive also allowed the fitting of an in cabin rotor reversing mechanism, allowing operators to reverse the entire rotor and feeder house in the event of a blockage. = The 88 series = The 88 series continued the 23 series line in parallel to the 120 series, and consisted of the 5088, 6088 and 7088 models. This series had 5.48m2 of separation area. The series was phased out of production in most markets until their last year of production in 2009. = The 130/230 series = In 2009, the 130/230 series was released. It has a Tier 4a/Tier 4 interim engine emissions control. This series has two sub-series with the difference based on total cleaning area. The smaller sub-series uses a 5.9m2 cleaning area and consists of the 5130 (Class V), 6130 (Class VI) and 7130 (Class VII) models. The larger sub-series uses a 6.1m2 cleaning area and consists of the 7230 (Class VII), 8230 (Class VIII) and 9230 (Class IX) models.http://www.caseih.com/australia/Products/Harvesting/AxialFlowCombines/Documents/14AUSAFC001_Axial_Flow_0414_WEB.PDF = The 4000 series = Based on the 66 series Axial-Flow harvesters, the 4000 series, 4077 and 4088 were produced from 2014 in CNH Industrial's Harbin plant in China  Further reading  * ToyTractorShow.com Salutes 25 years of Axial- Flow Combines * How the Axial-Flow Combine was developed under lock and key  References  Category:Combine harvesters Category:International Harvester vehicles ","title":"Case IH Axial Flow Combines"},{"id":"47735071","text":"The Bedbug (, ') is a play by Vladimir Mayakovsky written in 1928-1929 and published originally by Molodaya Gvardiya magazine (Nos. 3 and 4, 1929), then, as a book, by Gosizdat in 1929.The Works by V.

Received warmly by the audiences, it caused controversy and received harsh treatment in the Soviet press. Unlike its follow-up, The Bathhouse (denounced as ideologically deficient), The Bedbug was criticised mostly for its alleged 'aesthetic faults'. Plot The action of the play begins in 1929 in the U.S.S.R. Ivan Prisypkin is a young man in the age of NEP. On the day of his wedding to Elzevir Davidovna Renaissance, Prisypkin is frozen in a basement. After fifty years, he is revived in a world that looks very different. Around him is an ideal communist world, almost a utopia. There is no more poverty and destitution, illness and natural disasters have been defeated, and people have forgotten about drunkenness, smoking, and swearing. Prisypkin does not belong in this future. He becomes an exhibit at the zoo and serves as an example of the vices of a past age to the citizens of the future. The title of the play comes from a bed bug which was frozen at the same time as Prisypkin and becomes his companion.

Long considered to be an urban legend, they were rediscovered in 2015. They are believed to be up to 500 years old. The tunnel system is believed to extend for more than 10 km. Tunnels are high enough that a person could easily ride through on horseback. These tunnels begin in the historic center of Puebla and end to the Loreto fort, where the Cinco de Mayo battle happened. Researchers consider these tunnels may have been used by soldiers during the battle of Mexican liberation, though they also could have been used by clergy or also common folk. Various old and antique items such as old playthings like toys, marbles, kitchen accessories, guns, gunpowder and bullets, were found trapped in the mud. Most of these items and weaponry were from the mid-19th century, about the time of the Battle of Puebla dispute between Mexico and France. The city is planning to renovate part of the system and to open it for public viewing. As of 2017, tunnels are open for tours from 10:00‚Äì16:00 and cost $25 Mexican pesos. The tour over the tunnel involves a guided visit and a museum.

In an envy-free division, every agent feels that their share is at least as good as the share of any other agent, and thus no agent feels envy.  Definitions  A resource is divided among several agents such that every agent i receives a share X_i. Every agent i has a subjective preference relation \\\\succeq_i over different possible shares. The division is called envy-free if for all i and j: :::X_i \\\\succeq_i X_j If the preference of the agents are represented by a value functions V_i, then this definition is equivalent to: :::V_i(X_i) \\\\geq V_i(X_j) Put another way: we say that agent i envies agent j if i prefers the piece of j over his own piece, i.e.: :::X_i \\\\prec_i X_j :::V_i(X_i) < V_i(X_j) A division is called envy-free if no agent envies another agent.  History  EF was introduced to the problem of fair cake-cutting by George Gamow and Marvin Stern in 1958. In the context of fair cake-cutting, EF means that each agent believes that their share is at least as large as any other share. In the context of chore division, EF means that each agent believes their share is at least as small as any other share. The crucial issue is that no agent would wish to swap their share with any other agent. See: * Envy-free cake- cutting - a detailed survey of procedures and results related to the envy-free criterion in cake-cutting. * Group-envy-free - a strengthening of the envy- free criterion from individuals to coalitions. Later, EF was introduced to the economics problem of resource allocation by Duncan Foley in 1967. It became the dominant fairness criterion in economics. See, for example: * Varian's theorems See also: * Envy-free item assignment - a detailed survey of procedures and results related to the EF criterion in allocation of indivisible items. * Rental harmony - an assignment problem in which envy- freeness is the dominant fairness criterion.  Relations to other fairness criteria   See also  * Inequity aversion *Envy can promote more equal division in alternating-offer bargaining.

Seasons =Season 1= The series follows spymaster Professor Wolfgang McGee, an academic who secretly manages a roster of espionage assets. These assets, referred to as Romeo or Juliet spies, are informants engaged in intimate relations with intelligence targets. Wolfgang himself is a semi-retired Romeo operator, having worked his way up in an officially deniable \\"service\\" under the umbrella of Canada's intelligence community. Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, the Romeo and Juliet recruits infiltrate the city‚Äôs heroin trade and keep eyes on an asylum seeker, while their handler searches for the elusive faction leader of the Red Mountain Triad. =Season 2= In the Le Carr√©-esque second season, the master of espionage, Wolfgang McGee, steps away from his role of asset handler to investigate an attempted bombing in Vancouver. The case comes to Wolfgang through Harry, a shadowy government figure, who presents the theory that the attack could have been a false flag operation. For help, Wolfgang calls upon an old acquaintance, a black-balled spy named Norman. Together they review the chain of events surrounding the attack to uncover massive holes and blunders, either made by human error or deliberate sabotage.

The composition was first published in 1830 by F. P. Dunst in Frankfurt, along with the Piano Trio in E-flat major, WoO. 38, and the Piano Sonata in C major, WoO. 51. Background Beethoven composed the piece while travelling to Teplitz, where he intended to spend the summer. At the time, the Brentanos were resident in Karlsbad. He presented the work to the family on the 26 June 1812, prior to travelling to Prague. The exact reason for composing the piece is unclear, although Watson states in a footnote, that it was to encourage Maximiliane in her piano playing. Manuscript The composer's manuscript for this composition survives. Compared to most of his manuscripts, the music score of this piece is written neatly and can be read easily. Beethoven's suggested fingerings for piano is included in the manuscript. Structure This composition is a single movement written in sonata form. The tempo mark is Allegretto. Performance takes about 5 minutes.

Its history evolved from the town's earliest schools founded before and shortly after the American Revolutionary War. Students from Stockbridge, its small villages of Interlaken, Glendale and Larrywaug, and from the nearby town of West Stockbridge attended Williams High School. In April 1968 the school closed, when its students transferred to a new regional high school located in the town of Great Barrington.Loraine Anderson Devoe & Kathleen Wade Oppermann (1984), Williams High School Alumni Association, History and Directory, 1872-1968, pgs. 15-16, Retrieved September 5, 2015 History The first school in Stockbridge was erected in 1737 under the supervision of John Sergeant, a missionary to the local Mohican Indians. It served as a school for the Christian education of Indian children. Through the pre-Revolutionary War years several small schools were opened to serve the children of newly arriving settlers scattered between the distant boundaries of adjoining towns.Loraine Anderson Devoe & Kathleen Wade Oppermann (1984), Williams High School Alumni Association, History and Directory, 1872-1968, pg. 5, Retrieved September 5, 2015 The founding of the semi-private Academy after the Revolutionary War marked the beginning of a more structured commitment to secondary education in the town. Three of the four students in the first graduating class of Williams College in 1795 were alumni of the Academy. The school's reputation attracted students from outside the area who boarded with local families. In 1829 the ‚ÄòStockbridge Academy‚Äô was incorporated and sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄòNew Academy‚Äô. In the early and mid-1800s Stockbridge schools earned the distinction of educating three Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States who served on the high court at the same time.

Brewer, Life of a Supreme Court Justice, 1837-1910, Retrieved September 24, 2015 served together as Associate Justices from 1891 to 1897. =Cyrus Williams= In 1841 Cyrus Williams, a physician, businessman and president of the Housatonic Bank in Stockbridge, donated $3000 to the Academy. The school was soon renamed the Williams Academy for its benefactor. Williams was born on March 22, 1767 in Groton, Connecticut. His parents were Daniel and Esther Avery Williams. He was married first to Fannie West and then to Sarah Huntington. Williams died on October 20. 1841. His friend, David Dudley Field named his sixth son Cyrus West Field, after Williams. An inscription on a panel in the 1914 school building reads, In permanent gratitude to Cyrus Williams, a discerning citizen of this town, who, appreciated that knowledge is the only safeguard of free institutions, gave enduring reality to this belief by the endowment of our first public school. =Academy to public school transition= As public primary schools were built in Glendale in 1868 and Curtisville (Interlaken) in 1870, the Williams Academy continued its transition to full public status, and by the 1880s was known as the Williams Academy and Stockbridge High School. With the opening of a new building in April 1914, the name was changed to Williams High School. The evolution of schools in Stockbridge, from its first missionary school through various private and semi-private academies to a full public school system, paralleled the development of civic structures at the state and local levels over several hundred years. Student life =Academics= The school's curriculum had three tracks, business, college preparatory and agriculture. In addition to traditional business and college preparatory classes, there was a strong Future Farmers of America (FFA) chapter that attracted students from outside the district. The FFA program involved a curriculum centered around farming and animal husbandry. There was a chapter of the National Honor Society. =Extracurricular activities= Extracurricular activities involved several clubs, including French, Latin, Drama and Glee Clubs. There had also been a School Orchestra and a Rifle Club. There was a student council and each class elected officers. Representatives from the student body traveled to the state capitol in Boston and participated in the annual Boys and Girls State program.\\"1967 Konkapot, Stockbridge Library, Museum & Archives\\". Student groups worked on the Chieftain newspaper and Konkapot yearbook. The Konkapot was named in honor of Chief Konkapot, a leader of the local Mohican Indians in the early and mid-1700s. Students produced two literary magazines, first the Green and Gold and later the Scribbler. =Athletics= School colors were green and gold. Early in its history Stockbridge was sometimes referred to as 'Indian Town'. The attachment to that heritage is reflected in the names of the newspaper and yearbook, as well as the school's athletic teams, the ‚ÄòIndians‚Äô. Boys varsity sports included soccer, basketball, skiing, baseball, cross country and golf. Girls sports included basketball and field hockey. Also, there was a cheerleading team. The school's arch rival was Searles High School in Great Barrington, with other important rivalries involving high schools in the towns of Lenox and Lee. Regionalization debate A statewide emphasis on school regionalization, begun in the early 1950s, was designed to create economies of scale for rural communities faced with increasing costs of maintaining their own schools. In 1956 Stockbridge began regionalization discussions with several neighboring towns including Lenox, Lee, West Stockbridge and Great Barrington. For several years the idea was very contentious in all the communities. Votes in 1959 and 1960 could not find consensus on consolidation. In January 1960, Lenox and West Stockbridge voters approved a plan that failed in Stockbridge by three votes.Loraine Anderson Devoe & Kathleen Wade Oppermann (1984), Williams High School Alumni Association, History and Directory, 1872-1968, pg. 16, Retrieved September 20, 2015 =Stockbridge works to save its high school= In September 1963 Stockbridge voters overwhelming decided, by a 298 to 55 majority, to build a new facility for Williams High School. A site was chosen in fields below the Naumkeag estate north of the town center on land controlled by The Trustees of Reservations. The town successfully challenged opposition by the Trustees in the Massachusetts Supreme Court. However, efforts to maintain a high school in Stockbridge ended when the state refused to provide the necessary funds to support the effort.Loraine Anderson Devoe & Kathleen Wade Oppermann (1984), Williams High School Alumni Association, History and Directory, 1872-1968, pg. 16, Retrieved September 20, 2015 =Regionalization approved= After Lenox and Lee finally chose not to regionalize and maintain their own schools, Stockbridge, West Stockbridge and Great Barrington went to the polls again and approved a plan to enter into a consolidated Berkshire Hills Regional School District. Planning began for their primary and secondary schools to be located on adjoining campuses in Great Barrington. The district offices would be located in Stockbridge. The regionalization agreement united longtime rivals Williams High School and Searles High School into one student body. For the first time in nearly two and a half centuries, since John Sergeant founded an Indian mission school in 1737, the children of Stockbridge would not be attending school in their own community. School closure The last class to graduate from Williams High School was in June 1967. The graduation ceremony was held at Tanglewood, as had many of the school's graduation ceremonies over the years. The last student to receive a Williams High School diploma was John Gennari, president of the Class of 1967. The school did not actually close until April 1968, when the senior and junior classes moved to the newly completed Monument Mountain Regional High School in Great Barrington. Helping to manage the closure and transition was Henry L. O'Connor, the last principal to lead Williams High School. Pressure from the state, economies of scale for rural districts and fluctuating student populations had forced the closure of its high school, an outcome Stockbridge resisted for over a decade. =1914 school building= The three story brick school building opened in 1914 and located at 50 Main Street had been shared by Williams High School and the town's primary school known as 'Stockbridge Plain School'. Over the next fifty years several additions were made to the structure. This would be the final home for both schools. Following their closure, the building was remodeled and opened in 2008 as the Stockbridge town offices. Additionally, the building provides space for the police department, regional school district administration and a community gymnasium. Alma Mater (song) Oh fling out old Williams banner, flash its green upon the breeze, let its gold gleam in the sunshine, high above the smiling trees. For we love our Alma Mater, and her honored Green and Gold, and our hearts will e‚Äôer be loyal to old Williams as of old. So let the green then wave in triumph, let the gold flash in the sun, as a bold and brave defiance, that her loyal sons are one. Though the years may fade her colors, fleck the green and dull the gold, yet our hearts will e‚Äôer be loyal to old Williams as of old.

Hervey who owned Killiane CastleToday a countryside B&B;, see http://www.killianecastle.com. in County Wexford, Ireland. He was educated at the Oratory, Birmingham, and studied in London with Berthold Tours and Edouard Marlois, two organist-composers with a French background. Hervey worked as music critic for Vanity Fair (1889‚Äì92) and The Morning Post (1892‚Äì1908). He died in London.W.H.G. Flood: Introductory Sketch of Irish Musical History (London: William Reeves, undated [1921]), p. 94‚Äì95. Music Hervey composed in many forms including opera and orchestral music. Some of his larger works were written for and performed at major British music festivals at Cardiff, Norwich and Brighton. A French influence is detectable in his early chamber music. His wife Clare (n√©e Harrison, widowed Webster) occasionally contributed the words to some of his songs and the libretto to his second opera Ilona (1914). In an obituary for the Musical Times, his musical language was described as being \\"always marked by melodiousness, straightforwardness of utterance, and polish of manner\\".The Musical Times, vol. 63, April 1922, p. 277. Since 1959, the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London is awarding an annual Arthur Hervey Prize in the form of a scholarship for an outstanding young composer, which was initiated in memory of Hervey by bequest of his step-daughter, Nancy Webster. A relief portrait of Hervey in carved marble is preserved in the museum of the RAM.See http://www.ram.ac.uk/museum/item/18651. Writings Despite of his substantial musical oeuvre Hervey remained mainly known for his writings, which include biographical studies of composers, most of which being devoted to French contemporaries like Saint-Sa√´ns and Bruneau. He was widely regarded as an expert on French music.

Originally lying along the north side of the Borgo Nuovo street, after 1667 the building faced the north side of the large new square located west of the new Saint Peter's Square, designed in those years by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The square, named Piazza Rusticucci after the palace, was demolished in 1937‚Äì40 because of the erection of the new Via della Conciliazione. In 1940 the palace was dismantled and rebuilt with a different footprint along the north side of the new avenue, constructed between 1936 and 1950, which links St Peter's Basilica and the Vatican City to the center of Rome. Location Original position of palazzo Rusticucci (n. 1308), the second building east of the northern Colonnade of St. Peter, from Nuova Topografia di Roma by Giambattista Nolli (1748) The palace is located in the Borgo rione of Rome along the north side of Via della Conciliazione avenue, its main facade facing south.Gigli (1992), Inside front cover It belongs to the same block as the Palazzo dei Convertendi, another Renaissance building demolished in the late 1930s and reconstructed in the 1940s east of it. To the west Via Rusticucci separates it from the north Propylaea delimiting the square Piazza Pio XII (which roughly occupies the same area as the old Piazza Rusticucci) and facing Saint Peter's Square. The north side of the building borders two other reconstructed Renaissance edifices of Borgo: the Palazzo Jacopo da Brescia and the house of the physician of Paul III. History =Renaissance and baroque= Cardinal Girolamo Rusticucci, first owner of the palace The rear side of Palazzo Rusticucci (the building in the background with rusticated portal) seen from Vicolo del Farinone, with the Passetto di Borgo in the foreground, before the demolition of the neighborhood (ca. 1930). The coat of Arms above the arch belongs to Pope Pius V Medici (r. 1566‚Äì72) Girolamo Rusticucci, secretary of Pope Pius V (r. 1566‚Äì72), who in 1570 appointed him Cardinal of Santa Susanna, bought a palace lying almost at the end of the Via Alessandrina (the road later named Borgo Nuovo) in Borgo on 31 March 1572.Gigli (1992) p. 86 This building, once owned by Roberto Strozzi (exponent of the banker family from Florence), had been sold in 1567 to Pope Pius V, who donated it immediately to his nephew Paolo Ghislieri. Ghislieri sold it to the Cardinal five years later with the accordance of the pope. In order to enlarge his building, Rusticucci also bought several nearby houses. Selling negotiation not always finished successfully: an old woman refused to sell her home, forcing the architect to engulf it in the enlarged palace. However, the woman and her heirs could live there until they sold it to the owner of the \\"Caff√® San Pietro\\", one of the oldest coffee shops in the city.Borgatti (1926) p. 231 The strong-willed opposition of another owner forced the cardinal to renounce to extend the building to the east until Borgo Sant'Angelo, although the works had already commenced. A powerful angular rustication erected at the corner between Borgo Sant'Angelo and Borgo Nuovo testified until 1937 about the Rusticucci's intention. Several years went by after the acquisition of Ghislieri's palace, until in 1584 Rusticucci gave the task to design a larger palace to architect Domenico Fontana. After Fontana's transferral to Naples who, after the death of Sixtus V (r. 1585‚Äì90) and the brief intermezzo of Innocent IX (r. Oct.-Dec. 1591), could not win the favor of Pope Clement VIII (r. 1592‚Äì1605), the task was finished by his nephew Carlo Maderno.Cambedda (1990) p. 38Gigli (1992) p. 88 It is also worth noticing that in the early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time painting the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery.Borgatti (1926) p. 232 The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions on the walls of the room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years. Around 1630 the palace housed for a brief time the Collegio Nazareno, one of the oldest schools in Rome, founded in those years by Joseph Calasanz, and presently in Via del Bufalo, in Trevi rione. After that, the Rusticucci's heirs sold the building to Mario Accoramboni, member of a family of lesser nobility which had emigrated from the umbrian town of Gubbio to Rome. Exponents of the family acquired a high rank in the church and in the city: Ottavio was bishop of Fossombrone and Urbino, Roberto vicelegato at Ferrara, and during the epidemic of 1657, the owner of the palace, Roberto Accoramboni, received the task (personally given by Pope Alexander VII) of defending Borgo from the plague. In 1667, the erection of the Colonnades of St. Peter's square by Gian Lorenzo Bernini made it necessary to demolish the last block of houses (\\"isola\\") in front of the new square, situated between the roads of Borgo Vecchio and Borgo Nuovo: this block was named \\"isola del Priorato\\", since one of ƒ±ts buildings hosted the Priory of the knights of Rhodes.Gigli (1992) p. 144 The demolition created a large new square, which was delimited on the north side by Palazzo Rusticucci. This square, representing the vestibule of Saint Peter's Square, took its name from the building. In 1775 in a shop at the ground floor was founded the \\"Caff√® San Pietro\\", one of the oldest Coffee Houses in Rome. =Modern age= On 4 March 1902 the palace became the seat of the Belgian Historical Institute, and after a short time was acquired by the Congregation of Propaganda Fide. In 1940, because of the construction of the Via della Conciliazione, it was demolished and partially rebuilt in the same year with design by Clemente Busiri Vici, exponent of a Roman dynasty of architects.Gigli (1992) p. 90 Through the expropriation decrees, the commercial activities in the palace are known: in 1937 two shops were active along Piazza Rusticucci selling religious articles: moreover, the ground floor of the building hosted a tobacconist, a bakery, a pastry shop and a restaurant. The bakery was originally the aforementioned osteria where Raphael had painted his sketches. Towards the mid-19th century a Papal Zouave was killed in that eatery, which was shut down by the authorities as a result . When the shop was reopened several years after the capture of Rome on 20 September 1870, hosting first a pizzeria, then the aforementioned bakery, the rooms were renovated, and all the sketches were lost. Description Fountain of Palazzo Rusticucci, now kept in the garden of Sant'Alessio The original building had a harmonious and unadorned prospect, known through Rome's plan by Antonio Tempesta published in 1593, published when the palace was just finished, with seventeen windows and three floors.Cambedda (1990) p. 39 The facade along Via Alessandrina resembles those of coeval buildings, like Palazzo Ruspoli, built in Via del Corso by Bartolomeo Ammannati. Resulting from the union of several small houses, the edifice was very long, especially after the addition of another wing at the west end, along Via del Mascherino, sixty years after the death of Rusticucci in 1603.Cambedda (1990) p. 40 After this addition, the palace was unanimously described by the coeval city's guides as \\"lacking grace\\". Its main front had a monotonous and modest appearance: it was long, with three floors and a mezzanine, twenty-two windows and a rusticated portal. Its area covered . To the right of the entrance lay a rectangular yard with three orders, doric, ionic and corinthian. On the opposite side lay a smaller square yard, surrounded by a portico with serliana. The reconstructed building is shorter, having only 13 windows along its fa√ßade, which shows exposed bricks. The two yards have been rebuilt, while the cornices of the windows and the portal come from the original edifice. The palace as of today (2016) still hosts the \\"Caff√® San Pietro\\", which has its seat here since its establishment. A fountain erected in the palace's yard has been moved to the garden lying between the church of S. Alessio and that of Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill.

Maduro's response of declaring a state of emergency, closing the border to Colombia indefinitely and deporting thousands of Colombians that lived near the border, struck fear in tens of thousands of other Colombians living in Venezuela resulting in their emigration from the country and a crisis involving separated families and Colombians seeking food and shelter. The actions of President Maduro were questioned by human rights groups, the United States, the United Nations and the European Union. Conflicts eventually lessened months after tensions initially flared in August 2015. By July 2016, the Venezuelan government allowed Venezuelans to traverse into Colombia once again, with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans taking advantage of the opportunity in order to retrieve food due to shortages in Venezuela. On 12 August 2016, the Venezuelan government officially reopened its border with Colombia. Background Since the 1970s, Colombians had fled to Venezuela to avoid violent conflict in their homeland. In the 1990s, Colombians amounted to 77% of all immigrants in Venezuela, according to Raquel Alvarez, a sociologist at the Andes University in Venezuela. Going into the 2000s, Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez used record high oil revenues to fund populist policies and social programs known as Bolivarian Missions in Venezuela. With such programs, the Ch√°vez administration then granted Colombians residency, the right to vote and other social services; even offering bus rides for Colombian-Venezuelans across the border who wanted to vote for Ch√°vez. Colombians who received such benefits would often in turn support Ch√°vez in elections. The creation of currency controls and subsidies under Ch√°vez also allowed a business of smuggling to occur across borders. On the border of Colombia and Venezuela, Colombians would often take advantage of the Bolivarian government's subsidies and smuggle price fixed goods from Venezuela to Colombia in order to receive profits. Municipalities in the border affected by crisis. Going into the 2010s, economic actions performed by Ch√°vez's government over the previous decade such as overspending and price controls proved to be unsustainable, with the economy then beginning to falter, while inflation, povertyCharlie Devereux & Raymond Colitt. March 7, 2013. and shortages in Venezuela increasing. By then, Colombians who had emigrated to Venezuela became disappointed with Venezuela due to the economic collapse of its economy and increasing discrimination by the Venezuelan government and its supporters. Tens of thousands to possibly 200,000 Colombians had left Venezuela in the few years preceding 2015. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, passports to Colombia increased 150% between March 2014 and March 2015. Repatriation assistance of Colombian-Venezuelans had also reached a record number in the first quarter of 2015 and in early 2015, Martin Gottwald, the deputy head of the United Nation's refugee agency in Colombia, warned that many of the Colombian refugees that had fled to Venezuela may move back to Colombia. The high influx of Colombians returning to Colombia worried the Colombian government since the return of Colombians would raise the unemployment rate and cause a strain on public services. In the 10 months preceding the crisis, 9,000 additional Colombians were forced to leave Venezuela according to the Association of Colombians in Venezuela. In 2014 and 2015 under the Nicol√°s Maduro government, the socioeconomic situation of Venezuela grew more troubled as the country entered a recession, shortages worsened and the inflation rate rose to the highest point in Venezuelan history to over 100%. The Venezuelan government blamed shortages in Venezuela on smugglers stating that as much as 40% of the basic commodities it subsidized were being smuggled out of the country, though economists disagreed with such claims stating that only about 10% of subsidized products are smuggled out of the country. According to The Washington Post, \\"lawlessness and smuggling are rife along the Venezuelan-Colombian border ‚Äî but the trouble has been caused not by Colombians but by the Maduro government‚Äôs disastrous economic policies\\" and that \\"the flow is controlled not by poor migrants but by corrupt Venezuelan army officers\\". On 19 August 2015, three Venezuelan soldiers were injured from gunfire on the border of Colombia and Venezuela. President Maduro immediately closed the border to Colombia in San Antonio del T√°chira and Ure√±a. While President Maduro declared a state of emergency \\"to protect the people ... from criminals, from paramilitaries, from an economic war\\", others saw Maduro's actions as a distraction from the poor socioeconomic conditions of Venezuela and a way for him to blame Venezuela's problems on Colombia. President Maduro's confrontational actions were also compared to tactics used by his predecessor, Hugo Ch√°vez, that were used as distractions from the problems facing his government, with accusations presented by the Venezuelan government rarely involving any substantial evidence. Effects Colombian National Police officers providing items for a woman and her child. On 20 August after the state of emergency was declared by President Maduro, Venezuelan authorities combed through designated areas on the border, checking the documents of residents. When Colombian families and many of their children who did not have their papers in order were discovered, they were forced from their shanty homes constructed of decrepit wood and sent to a football field, being held without food or water the entire day and were then deported later that night. Homes were marked with an \\"R\\" if the home was searched and \\"D\\" if the home was destined to be destroyed, though President Maduro also promised to demolish the entire neighborhood. Other Colombians were told after their houses were raided that they had 72 hours to evacuate their homes before they would be destroyed. Despite the declared state of emergency, the areas in Venezuela where the declaration was in effect saw little police activity and events such as fairs and parties occurred as usual. On 28 August, Colombians could be seen crossing the T√°chira River carrying their life possessions from Venezuela to Colombia. While authorities on the Colombian side assisted individuals fleeing Venezuela across the river under the sun, Venezuelan authorities could be seen on the Venezuelan side of the river, laying in the shade relaxing or on their cellphones. Later in the day, Venezuelan authorities had also prevented Colombians from crossing the river arbitrarily. Reports by some refugees also suggested that they had been mistreated by Venezuelan authorities, with Venezuelan authorities allegedly damaging homes and stealing possessions. An Inter-American Commission on Human Rights worker questioning a woman at a refugee camp in Colombia. Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos quickly responded to the incoming migrants with his government constructing tents and living quarters in various buildings while also providing food and medical assistance for the displaced Colombians. A subsidy of about $80 for displaced Colombians was announced with the Colombian government announcing that assistance of jobs for the deportees was in progress. President Santos also demanded that children be allowed to return to schools in Venezuela and for Colombians with belongings left in Venezuela to be able to receive what they own, stating that \\"Colombians need their fundamental rights respected\\". The Venezuelan government allowed the children to return to schools in Venezuela. The Colombian government also promised returning Colombians that citizenship would be granted for their Venezuelan family members, with Colombian foreign minister, Mar√≠a √Ångela Holgu√≠n, stating that \\"we want families to live together, not to break them apart\\". Colombia also recalled its ambassador from Venezuela on 28 August with Venezuela recalling its ambassador from Colombia as well. By 1 September, it was reported by the Colombian government that hundreds of children were separated from their families and that the Venezuelan government ignored requests to reunite hundreds of families that were torn apart during the crisis. The Wayuu population numbering at about 600,000 people may also be affected by the closing of the border. Wayuu natives do not have passports and do not recognize the border between Colombia and Venezuela, with contraband brought from Venezuela not being seen as illegal by the Wayuu and tribal leaders warning of increasing social tensions from preventing trade. On 12 September, Venezuela and Colombia send moving troops and armored vehicles along the border. On 13 September, Colombia is demanding an explanation from Venezuela after spotting two military aircraft flying in Colombian airspace, the defense ministry said Sunday. The confrontation comes amid a larger diplomatic rupture between the countries as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has closed major border crossings and deported of thousands of Colombian nationals. On 14 September, another Venezuelan military airplane flew into Colombian airspace without permission on Sunday, the head of Colombia's air force said, the second such incident over the weekend that threatens to further complicate relations between the two countries. The Venezuelan aircraft crossed the border at eastern Vichada province and flew about 10 km (six miles) inside Colombian territory, air force General Carlos Bueno told reporters on Monday. He said radar detected two planes, but only one crossed the border. Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos has already ordered a formal protest and an explanation from Venezuela after two military airplanes were detected on Saturday in northern La Guajira province. Those aircraft entered Colombia, flew about 2.9 km (1.8 miles) over the border and then circled above a military unit.http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/colombia-says- another-ven/2126600.html CNA (news channel) On 15 September, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that at least 23,738 had returned or were deported to Colombia from Venezuela. On 17 September, a Venezuelan fighter jet with two people on board crashed near the Colombian border late on Thursday evening after an \\"illicit aircraft\\" believed to be Colombian was found violating airspace, according to the Venezuelan government. It was not immediately clear whether the two pilots on board the Sukhoi Su-30 aircraft had been killed. The cause of the crash has not been determined. On 18 September, about 15 Venezuelan soldiers entered Maicao municipality in eastern La Guajira province in apparent pursuit of an individual on a motorcycle who had attempted to cross the border into Venezuela, the Colombian army said in a statement. After the individual on the motorcycle entered a home, the soldiers burnt the abandoned vehicle and returned to Venezuela, the army said. Community members said they were mistreated by the soldiers, and shell casings, as well as the remains of the charred motorcycle, were found by Colombian troops, the statement added. The army will remain in the municipality and has turned over details of the events to the defense minister. Reapproachement Tensions between the two countries slowed months after the initial border controversy. Nearly one year later in July 2016, the Venezuelan government allowed Venezuelans to cross the border into Colombia on specific dates. In that month, over 200,000 Venezuelans poured into Colombia to purchase goods due to shortages in Venezuela. On 12 August 2016, the Venezuelan government officially reopened its border with Colombia, with thousands of Venezuelans, again, entering Colombia to seek escape from Venezuela's crisis. Through 2016, many Venezuelans sought to emigrate into neighboring Colombia following the reopening of the Venezuela‚ÄìColombia border. Reactions =Supranational bodies= * ‚Äì On 29 August 2015, the European Union External Action Service stated the closing of the border \\"followed by forced refoulement puts at risk the overall humanitarian situation, security and stability in the bordering region\\" further stating that \\"solutions should be found in full respect of human rights and to ensure the well being of the local population\\". * 25px Organization of American States ‚Äì On 31 August, member nations of the OAS that included many allies to the Venezuelan government and relied on its subsidized oil \\"blocked a motion to convene a foreign ministers‚Äô meeting on the expulsions\\". * ‚Äì On 28 August 2015, concerned over the \\"reports of human rights violations occurring in the context of deportations of Colombian\\" stating that both countries should be settle the situation with \\"calm discussion and dialogue, firmly grounded in their obligations under international human rights law and refugee law\\", while concern was also expressed due to Venezuela's \\"declaration of a ‚Äòstate of emergency‚Äô\\". =Governments= * ‚Äì Paraguay's foreign minister, Eladio Loizaga, demanded that \\"the rights of migrants be respected, to be treated as human\\" and that \\"the situation faced by Colombian migrants should be considered with the greatest attention and priority by the countries of UNASUR\\". * ‚Äì The Department of State of the United States of America stated that they were \\"ready to work with both countries and other regional partners to find a peaceful, humane, and enduring solution\\", saying that they had respect for \\"secure borders and safe and orderly migration\\", though they urged attention upon \\"the worsening humanitarian situation\\" on the border. =Catholic Church= * 15px Holy See ‚Äì Pope Francis stated on 6 September that \\"bishops of Venezuela and Colombia have met in recent days to analyze together the painful situation that has sprung up on the border between the two countries\\" and that he could \\"see a clear sign of hope\\" from the meeting. =Non- governmental organizations= Human rights groups have condemned the Venezuelan government's acts of marking homes for destruction and then demolishing them. * Amnesty International ‚Äì On 26 August 2015, Amnesty International stated that countries have \\"the duty to maintain security and public order, including in border areas and in some extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances in the law, may declare a state of emergency for a limited period\\" though \\"these actions may not result in human rights violations\\". They continued, saying that \\"the Venezuelan state must ensure that the cases of all persons whose expulsion or deportation under consideration are individually examined in a fair and transparent procedure where they can challenge the expulsion and to have their cases reviewed\\" and that \\"Venezuela is obliged to protect the right to life, physical integrity, due process and judicial protection among others, even when a state of emergency applies.\\" =Others= * President Maduro was also criticized for deporting Colombians with his actions compared to Donald Trump's illegal immigration political position, with the comparison of Maduro and Trump being quickly disseminated throughout the internet. The Venezuelan government's tactics were also compared to the Nazi treatment of the Jews, with comparisons made to the deportations, Nazi ghettos and the marking of homes to be destroyed. * On 6 September, hundreds of Colombians in C√∫cuta protested against the closure of the border wearing colors of the Colombian national football team and carrying Colombian flags.

It stars Sally Williams, Georgina Neville, Davo Hardy and Josh Wiseman.https://dekkoo.vhx.tv/lives-we-lead-the The plot deals with four characters, as seen over the course of fifty years and through various turns of fortune as they each deal with the attitudes and expectations imposed on them in childhood. Pamela (Williams) and Edith (Neville) are two upper-middle-class sisters, but their widowed father overtly favors one over the other. Gavin (Wiseman) comes from a privileged family, but lacks affection and belonging. And Kerrod (Hardy) is from a working-class family and is the youngest of three, who aspires to provide better for his family than his own father did. The film was well-received by critics and the general public upon its premiere at the Ritz Cinema, Sydney Australia on 2 August 2015, and its DVD release on 13 October 2015, with worldwide distribution via TLA Releasing. It was included in the Australian database of films OzFlix as of April 2017.https://www.ozflix.tv/#!/browse/film/2828/the-lives-we-lead Amazon re- released the DVD in September 2019. Plot Chronicles the lives of four friends, whose lives are consumed by the unfair attitudes and values imposed upon them as children. The Lives We Lead spans over 50 years, following these distinct characters from childhood to old age, as they grapple with the effects of their very different attitudes towards life, love and fulfillment as circumstance and the actions of others influence their decisions and shape their futures. The film opens with the assembly of a photo album and transitions to a playground and introduces the characters as children, each developing their personalities amid their strained family dynamics. Pamela and Edith are two competitive sisters who enjoy taunting each other. Their widower father dotes on Pamela for her confidence and extroverted personality, often shaming Edith for being more introverted and studious. This results in Pamela developing a narcissistic Cinderella complex, while Edith rebels amid strong feelings of inadequacy. Gavin, the new kid, comes from a very well-to-do family and is amply provided for, but his parents communicate through barbed passive aggression and all but overlook Gavin, their only child. He is to be seen, not heard. Later when his homosexuality is established and his mother runs off to seek her own happiness, Gavin's father rejects him as the greatest disappointment he has ever known, citing his friends the root of Gavin's outspoken need for belonging. Kerrod, another local boy, is the third of three boys from a working-class family, living adjacent to Pamela and Edith. He is taught to be a provider and a hardworking tradesman. Upon graduating high school, Pamela and Kerrod are shown to be dating. She is pursuing acting and he has an electrician apprenticeship. 16-year-old Edith has become a rebellious aspiring writer, possessing a distinctly bitter world view, while Gavin is shown attending a gay social event at which he meets Michael, a talent agent. Gavin and Edith make a pact to be one another's companion safety net, should they be unlucky in love. Edith rejects Gavin's suggestion of someday seeking IVF together; refusing to sacrifice her dream career for family or the needs of others. Coincidentally, Kerrod and Pamela unexpectedly fall pregnant. The fierce backlash is quickly overshadowed by the sudden death of Kerrod's father, closely followed by their shotgun wedding. Pamela visits a palm reader who points out that she does not appear to have a life purpose. Pamela storms away, infuriated. Gavin's relationship with Michael turns sour and he stays with Kerrod and Pamela, who is struggling with postpartum depression. Edith's writing career takes off, freeing her from the obligation to her father and the rest of her family. Gavin and Pamela both attend a spiritual retreat, from which they both return to their former lives with a stronger sense of self. Pamela cites time being the main struggle in her life and resolves to live her life to the fullest while she is still young; Gavin cites men as his greatest weakness and promptly returns to Michael for one more try at their relationship. Two years later, at the birthday party of Kerrod and Pamela's son, Gavin drunkenly kisses them both and Edith defuses the situation by taking him to a private room in the house. Overwhelmed by a sudden rush of inadequacy and jealousy, Edith sexually assaults Gavin and falls pregnant to him. In a moment of deja vu, the news of Edith's pregnancy coincides with the death of her own father. Stranger still, Pamela also announces she is expecting again. Gavin attempts to mend ties with his father, but is rejected once more. Edith, conflicted with exactly why she wants to have child in the first place, has a chance meeting with a respected publisher and is given a great career opportunity. Her subsequent decision to have an abortion effectively breaks Gavin's heart and their friendship is terminated. Six years later, Pamela's sense of purpose has begun to wane in the shadow of Edith's success and her marriage to Kerrod begins to fracture under the stress of parenthood. Through a montage, seen primarily from Pamela's point of view, the extent of their financial difficulties is made apparent, as is Pamela's shame at not achieving with her life as she had wanted, made worse still by Edith's ability to lift the family out of debt. On their 15th anniversary, Kerrod shoves Pamela during another quarrel. Overcome with guilt, Kerrod retreats to Gavin's house. He is distressed and inebriated upon arrival and Michael encourages Kerrod to pursue his own happiness but also indecently assaults him. Kerrod violently defends himself and Gavin breaks up with Michael and leaves with Kerrod. Struggling with her marriage breakdown, Pamela indulges in some casual sexual encounters before the next leap in time. Over the next 20 years, Kerrod raises his sons on a country property far away from Pamela. Gavin was there with him for a while but eventually found a new outlet for his acting career, which becomes wildly successful and he moves to the United Kingdom. He is seen calling his father to postpone some social plans, but mentions his new partner and his appreciation at how his parents are working out their differences. Gavin's parents are then seen, well into their 80s or 90s, tenderly holding hands. Kerrod suffers a heart attack and his acute condition reunites Pamela, who is now a B-grade thespian and cabaret performer, with Edith, a successful best-selling author. Gavin is unable to make it back to Kerrod before he dies, but both Pamela and Edith are able to bury the hatchet with each other at his funeral. They agree that their naivete and sibling rivalry were the root of their poor life choices but also that there is ultimately nothing to forgive. Edith graciously soothes Pamela's bitterness over the sense that her life is without purpose, explaining that this means she can do whatever she wants with her life. She speaks philosophically about wisdom and regrets and the two feuding sisters are able to find peace together. Many years later, Gavin and Edith have passed away and Pamela reflects on her long and family-oriented life. She sits alone and wistful, closing a photo album and shedding a tear, before we dissolve to a view of the playground at sunset and a clock pointing sharply at 12.

It contains a single species, Eohyosaurus wolvaardti. Discovery Eohyosaurus is known solely from the holotype SAM-PK-K10159, a partial skull missing the front end, with associated incomplete lower jaws currently housed at the Iziko South African Museum, Cape Town. The specimen was discovered by Frederik Petrus Wolvaardt in December 2000, loose on boulder-strewn slopes at the base of a cliff, at Farm Lemoenfontein 44, Rouxville District of the Free State Province. It was collected from the middle deposits of the Burgersdorp Formation of Beaufort Group. This horizon belongs to Subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone, dating to the early Anisian stage of the early Middle Triassic period, about 246 million years ago. Farm Lemoenfontein 44 also yielded remains of the archosauriform Erythrosuchus africanus, the bauriid Microgomphodon oligocynus, the cynodont Trirachodon, the kannemeyeriid Kannemeyeria as well as unidentified procolophonid remains. All known basal rhynchosaurs came from similar deposits in the Beaufort Group, and while Howesia browni and Mesosuchus browni are also known from Subzone B of Burgersdorp Formation (from different localities), Noteosuchus colletti is known from the earliest Triassic Katberg Formation (Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone). Etymology Eohyosaurus was first described and named by Richard J. Butler, Mart√≠n D. Ezcurra, Felipe C. Montefeltro, Adun Samathi and Gabriela Sobral in 2015 and the type species is Eohyosaurus wolvaardti. The generic name is derived from Greek ', meaning \\"early\\"/\\"dawn\\", ', meaning \\"pig\\"/\\"hog\\", and ' meaning \\"lizard\\", in reference to Eohyosaurus being one of the earliest stratigraphically occurring rhynchosaurs, a group commonly described as \\"pig-like reptiles\\". The specific name honors Frederik Petrus Wolvaardt who discovered the type specimen SAM-PK-K10159. Description Due to the limited material known of Eohyosaurus, the holotype partial skull was scanned in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, focusing on its tooth rows and endocranium due to being too large to be scanned completely. The computed tomography data was provided to the Iziko South African Museum, to be archived along with the holotype. Eohyosaurus possesses one autapomorphy, a unique trait among Rhynchosauria, a jugal bone with elongate dorsal portion that forms the entire front margin of the infratemporal fenestra and that articulates from the front with the entire back margin of the elongated bottom portion of the postorbital bone. Other traits that together comprise a unique combination of characters include some traits that are shared with Howesia and Rhynchosauridae, but not with Mesosuchus. Such traits include the presence of a sagittal crest on parietal bone, maxillae and dentaries that are expanded from the middle to the sides, and with teeth present on both the occlusal and lingual surfaces. However, unlike rhynchosaurids, but like both Howesia and Mesosuchus, Eohyosaurus lacks a longitudinal occlusal groove and an occlusal blade on its maxillae and dentaries, respectively. Like in Rhynchosauridae and possibly Howesia (but not Mesosuchus), the occlusal margin of its maxilla is offset to the bottom from the lower margin of the main body of the jugal bone. Unlike rhynchosaurids that possess a short anguli oris crest on the jugal, in Eohyosaurus it is present on the side surface of the maxilla, while Mesosuchus lacks it entirely and it is unknown in Howesia. As in Howesia but not Mesosuchus and most rhynchosaurids (where it contacts the quadratojugal), the back portion of its jugal is short and ends at approximately 50% of the front-to-back length of the infratemporal fenestra. Unlike in both Howesia and Mesosuchus, but similarly to the rhynchosaurids, the elongated back portion of the postorbital ends above the front margin of the bottom portion of the squamosal. Finally, as in Mesosuchus and Rhynchosauridae (but not Howesia), the elongated bottom portion of the squamosal extends for more than 50% of the back margin of the infratemporal fenestra. Phylogeny The following cladogram is simplified after the phylogenetic analysis of Butler et al. (2015) and shows the placement of Eohyosaurus within Rhynchosauria. Butler et al. (2015) used an updated version of Montefeltro et al. (2013), expanded specifically to better resolved basal rhynchosaurs.

It is one of two major parties in the bicameral Parliament of South Australia, the other being the Liberal Party of Australia (SA Division). Since the 1970 election, marking the beginning of democratic proportional representation (one vote, one value) and ending decades of pro-rural electoral malapportionment known as the Playmander, Labor have won 11 of the 15 elections. Spanning 16 years and 4 terms, Labor was last in government from the 2002 election until the 2018 election. Jay Weatherill led the Labor government since a 2011 leadership change from Mike Rann. During 2013 it became the longest-serving state Labor government in South Australian history, and in addition went on to win a fourth four-year term at the 2014 election. Labor's most notable historic Premiers of South Australia include Thomas Price in the 1900s, Don Dunstan in the 1970s and John Bannon in the 1980s. Formation 1893 colonial election. A United Trades and Labor Council meeting with the purpose of creating an elections committee was convened on 12 December 1890, and held on 7 January 1891. The elections committee was formed, officially named the United Labor Party of South Australia (unlike state Labor, prior to 1912 their federal counterparts included the 'u' in their spelling of Labour) with John McPherson the founding secretary. Four months later, Labor enjoyed immediate success, electing David Charleston, Robert Guthrie and Andrew Kirkpatrick to the South Australian Legislative Council. A week later, Richard Hooper won the 1891 Wallaroo by-election as an Independent Labor member in the South Australian House of Assembly. McPherson won the 1892 East Adelaide by-election on 23 January, becoming the first official Labor leader and member of the House of Assembly. Prior to party creation, South Australian politics had lacked parties or solid groupings, although loose liberal and conservative blocs had begun to develop by the end of the 1880s. The 1893 election was the first general election Labor would stand at, resulting in liberal and conservative leaning MPs beginning to divide, additionally with unidentified groupings and independents, as well as the subsequent formation of the staunchly anti-Labor National Defence League. The voluntary turnout rate increased from 53 to 68 percent, with Labor on 19 percent of the vote, and 10 Labor candidates including McPherson and Hooper were elected to the 54-member House of Assembly which gave Labor the balance of power. The Kingston liberal government was formed with the support of Labor, ousting the Downer conservative government. Kingston served as Premier for a then-record of six and a half years, usually implementing legislation with Labor support. Thomas Price formed the state's first Labor minority government and the world's first stable Labor Party government at the 1905 election with the support of several non-Labor MPs to form the Price-Peake administration, which was re-elected at the 1906 double dissolution election, with Labor falling just two seats short of a majority. So successful, John Verran led Labor to form the state's first of many majority governments at the 1910 election, just two weeks after the 1910 federal election where their federal counterparts formed Australia's first elected majority in either house in the Parliament of Australia, the world's first Labor Party majority government at a national level, and after the 1904 Chris Watson minority government the world's second Labor Party government at a national level.Sound of Trumpets: History of the Labour Movement in South Australia - By Jim MossWhy did a 'labour movement' emerge in South Australia in the 1880s? - By Nicholas Klar Known as the United Labor Party of South Australia until 1917, the Australian Labor Party at both a state/colony and federal level pre-dates, among others, both the British Labour Party and the New Zealand Labour Party in party formation, government, and policy implementation. Premiers Thirteen of the nineteen parliamentary Labor leaders have served as Premier of South Australia: Thomas Price (1905‚Äì1909), John Verran (1910‚Äì1912), Crawford Vaughan (1915‚Äì1917), John Gunn (1924‚Äì1926), Lionel Hill (1926‚Äì1927 and 1930‚Äì1931; expelled from party but continued as Premier until 1933), Frank Walsh (1965‚Äì1967), Don Dunstan (1967‚Äì1968 and 1970‚Äì1979), Des Corcoran (1979), John Bannon (1982‚Äì1992), Lynn Arnold (1992‚Äì1993), Mike Rann (2002‚Äì2011) and Jay Weatherill (2011‚Äì2018). Robert Richards was Premier in 1933 while leading the rebel Parliamentary Labor Party of MPs who had been expelled in the 1931 Labor split; he would later be readmitted and lead the party in opposition. Bannon is Labor's longest-serving Premier of South Australia, ahead of Rann and Dunstan by a matter of weeks. Every Labor leader for more than half a century has gone on to serve as Premier. Deputy Premiers Since the position's formal introduction in 1968, seven parliamentary Labor deputy leaders have served as Deputy Premier of South Australia: Des Corcoran (1968 and 1970‚Äì1979), Hugh Hudson (1979), Jack Wright (1982‚Äì1985), Don Hopgood (1985‚Äì1992), Frank Blevins (1992‚Äì1993), Kevin Foley (2002‚Äì2011) and John Rau (2011‚Äì18). Foley is the state's longest-serving Deputy Premier.

Confusion over his names Franz Xaver Oberleitner is identified in some sources as \\"Andreas Oberleitner\\". This is the name given in Volume 24 of the Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB) (1886), a work of reference on which much subsequent reliance is placed. The ADB entry names Andreas Leitner and then provides two paragraphs on his career and published output as an orientalist. Sources closer in time and place to Oberleitner himself, including Volume 20 of the Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich (1869) state that there were two brothers involved. Andreas Oberleitner was born in 1786, and as a young man acquired a certain notability in Vienna as a musician (instrumentalist), although by the 1860s it was not known whether or not he was still alive. Oberleitner was born in 1789. He was the theologian / orientalist according to these sources. It appears that conflation of the two brothers' names had not started in 1832, which is when Oberleitner died. Life Oberleitner was born at the house of the local landowner at Angern an der March, a small town a short distance to the north of Vienna. His father, Andreas Oberleitner had an administrative position locally, working for the Kinsky family. It is known that there were numerous Oberleitner siblings. Oberleitner attended school in nearby Gaunersdorf (since 1917 known as Gaweinstal) where he was taught to sing and to play the violin. His musical talent led to his acceptance, at the age of 10, into the Vienna Boys' Choir. This involved relocation to Vienna where he attended the St Anna Gymnasium (secondary school). In 1807 he entered the Schottenstift, a Benedictine monastery in the city. Between 1808 and 1812 he studied Theology at the University of Vienna: on 30 August 1812 he was consecrated as a priest. It was also in 1812 that he became \\"Student overseer\\" (\\"Studienpr√§fekt \\") at the monastery. From 1813 till 1816 he took on the teaching of \\"Humanities\\" at the Schottenstift. At the same time he was attending classes provided by a Maronite priest called Anton Aryda at the university on Arabic, Syriac and Aramaic languages. Aryda returned to Syria in 1816 and Oberleitner was appointed to replace him as university professor for Oriental Languages and Biblical criticism. In 1817 he received his Doctorate in Theology. It was as an orientalist, however, that he rapidly acquired an outstanding reputation, enhanced by a succession of publications on the Arabic and Syriac grammar and languages. In 1818/19, 1819/20 and again in 1825/26 Oberleitner was Dean of the university's Faculty of Catholic Theology. From 1823 he also served as University Archivist. In 1832 he was appointed university Director of Theology: 1832 was also the year in which, unexpectedly, he died aged 43. His text books on his specialist languages were considerable achievements, and remained valued tools for scholars long after his death on account of their practical structures.

There they refused to take food and wine from the king and were given knowledge and insight into dreams and visions by God, and at the end of their training they proved ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in the kingdom. The overall theme of Daniel is God's sovereignty over history. Chapter 1 introduces God as the figure in control of all that happens, the possessor of sovereign will and power: it is he who gives Jehoiakim into Nebuchadnezzar's hands and takes Daniel and his friends into Babylonian exile, he gives Daniel \\"grace and mercies,\\" and gives the four young Jews their \\"knowledge and skill.\\" The Book of Daniel is \\"a composite text of dubious historicity from various genres\\", and Daniel himself is a legendary figure. The book of which he is the hero divides into two parts, a set of tales in chapters 1‚Äì6 from no earlier than the Hellenistic period (323‚Äì30 BCE), and the series of visions in chapters 7‚Äì12 from the Maccabean era (the mid-2nd century BCE). Chapter 1 was apparently added as an introduction to the tales when they were collected around the end of the 3rd century BCE. Summary In the third year of king Jehoiakim of Judah, God let the kingdom fall \\"into the hand\\" (Daniel 1:1) or under the influence of Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon, who carried off some of the Temple vessels to Babylon. Some young Jews of royal and noble blood, already educated (Daniel 1:4), to be taught the literature and language of Babylon for three years, at the end of which they would be placed in the royal court. Among these young men were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, who were given new names (Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah became Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, while Daniel's Babylonian name was Belteshazzar) and allocated rations of food and wine. But Daniel resolved not to defile himself, and refused the royal food and wine, thriving instead on vegetables and water. God gave them knowledge and skill, and to Daniel he gave insight into visions and dreams, and when the three years of training were completed none were found to compare with them in wisdom and understanding. Composition and structure The Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Jewish community in Babylon and Mesopotamia in the Persian and early Hellenistic periods (5th to 3rd centuries BCE), before being expanded in the Maccabean era (mid-2nd century) by the addition of the visions in chapters 7‚Äì12. Daniel is a legendary figure, probably chosen for the book's hero because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition. The tales are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4, which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar. Chapters 2‚Äì7 are in the form of a chiasmus, a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side: * A. (2:4b-49) ‚Äì A dream of four kingdoms replaced by a fifth ** B. (3:1‚Äì30) ‚Äì Daniel's three friends in the fiery furnace *** C. (4:1‚Äì37) ‚Äì Daniel interprets a dream for Nebuchadnezzar *** C'. (5:1‚Äì31) ‚Äì Daniel interprets the handwriting on the wall for Belshazzar ** B'. (6:1‚Äì28) ‚Äì Daniel in the lions' den * A'. (7:1‚Äì28) ‚Äì A vision of four world kingdoms replaced by a fifth Daniel 1 serves as an introduction to the book, showing how God continues to move throughout history when men seem to have failed (i.e., how God stands for his people when they are in a foreign land and subject to an alien power). An interesting feature of the book is that the accounts of chapters 2‚Äì6 and the visions in chapter 7 are in Aramaic (after the first few lines of chapter 2 in Hebrew). However, the visions of chapters 8‚Äì12 are in Hebrew, as is the introduction, chapter 1. Genre and themes =Genre= The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse, a literary genre in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an angelic interpreter, and an emphasis on end-time events. Apocalypses were common from 300 BCE to 100 CE, not only among Jews and Christians, but Greeks, Romans, Persians and Egyptians. Daniel, the book's hero, is a representative apocalyptic seer, the recipient of the divine revelation. He refused to learn the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and thus surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge. The book is also an eschatology, meaning a divine revelation concerning the end of the present age, a moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom. =Themes= The overall theme of the Book of Daniel is God's sovereignty over history, and the theme of the tales in chapters 1‚Äì6 is that God is sovereign over all earthly kings. Daniel 1 introduces the fundamental question that runs through the entire book, how God may continue to work his plans when all seems lost. Chapter 1 introduces God as the figure in control of all that happens, the possessor of sovereign will and power: he \\"gives\\" Jehoiachim into Nebuchadnezzar's hands, he \\"gives\\" Daniel \\"grace and mercies\\", and it is he who gives the four young Jews their \\"knowledge and skill\\". It was God who took Daniel and his friends into Babylonian exile, and it is God who is the source of their gifts and salvation. Interpretation Jehoiakim from Guillaume Rouill√©'s Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum, 1553 =Daniel 1 and history= According to the opening verses of Daniel 1 the hero's captivity began when Nebuchadnezzar \\"besieged\\" Jerusalem in the third year of King Jehoiakim (606 BCE), but it is difficult to harmonise these verses with known history: * According to other sources in the Bible, Nebuchadnezzar did not begin to reign until the fourth year of Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 25:1); * The Babylonian chronicles note Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns in Palestine as Crown Prince before this, but none are on Jerusalem; * All the sources, Biblical and Babylonian, mention an attack on Jerusalem in 597, but none prior. Daniel's story ends with his final vision in the third year of Cyrus (Daniel 10:1 ‚Äì chapters 11 and 12 of the book are the continuation of the same final vision). The third year of Cyrus was 536 BCE, and the although the fact that this falls exactly 70 years after 586 may not be significant (the author never draws attention to it), it strikes a chord with Daniel 9, where he introduces the prophecy of a 70-year time-span for the exile. He has apparently drawn his history from 2 Chronicles 36:5‚Äì7, which says that Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiakim to Babylon (he took Zedekiah, who became king on his death), and 2 Kings 24:1, which says that Jehoiakim served Nebuchadnezzar three years and then rebelled. The story of the noble Daniel and his friends being taken off to Babylon could be viewed as a fulfillment of the prophet Isaiah's warning to King Hezekiah that his sons would become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon (Isaiah 39:7), although this does not mean that the story was inspired by this verse. =Daniel's refusal of the royal food= There has been much scholarly discussion of the reasons for Daniel's refusal of the king's ration. The explanation perhaps most commonly found is that Daniel and his friends wished to avoid breaking the Jewish religious laws regarding ritual slaughter (the kosher laws); alternatively, they may have wished to avoid meat and wine as these, unlike vegetables and water, were regularly used in offerings to gods (in this case, the gods of Babylon). In either case, the theological point being made is that the Jewish youths are remaining loyal to the God of Israel while still serving the foreign king. =The authors of the Book of Daniel= The portrayal of Daniel and his companions as noble and educated youths may reflect the circle of the book's authors: the Jewish youths serve a foreign king while remaining true to the Jewish law. This circle are identified later in the book, in chapters 11 and 12, as the maskilim, \\"the wise\\", teachers who will \\"give understanding\\" and \\"lead many to righteousness,\\" despite the suffering they will endure in the end-time of persecution. It is these 2nd- century BCE teachers of wisdom who stand behind the author of the book of Daniel.

The division was formed in 1923. It fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945. Postwar, it became the 11th Machine Gun Artillery Division.  History  = Before 1941 = The 34th was originally formed as a territorial division of the Volga Military District in accordance with orders of 14 and 23 September 1923, from the cadre of the mobilization unit colocated with the 33rd Samara Rifle Division. Headquartered at Samara, the division included the 100th, 101st, and 102nd Rifle Regiments, stationed at Ufa, Syzran, and Samara, respectively, in addition to light artillery and howitzer battalions and sapper and communications companies. Its anniversary was celebrated on 8 November. The artillery units of the division were merged to form the 34th Artillery Regiment on 20 October 1924. As a territorial unit, the permanent cadre of the division conducted pre-conscription training camps in the northern hemisphere winter, three-month summer training camps for new conscripts, and fifteen-day combined arms training camps for older conscripts every year since 1924. The conscripts assigned to the 34th were drawn from Samara Governorate. It was given the honorific Middle Volga on 10 July 1930. In March 1934, it attained Cadre status and was transferred to Far East, joining the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army (OKDVA) in April. On 10 June 1935, it received the honorific named for Valerian Kuybyshev. At this point it was assigned to the 18th Rifle Corps of the OKDVA with its headquarters and 102nd Rifle Regiment at Birobidzhan, while the 100th Rifle Regiment and 34th Artillery Regiment were at Babstovo and the 101st Syzran Rifle Regiment was at Novy. On 1 July 1938 the OKDVA was broken up and the division became part of the 2nd Army, which became the 2nd Red Banner Army on 4 September of that year. On 1 July 1940 it became part of the newly formed 15th Army when the 2nd Red Banner Army was split. = World War II =  Garrison duty in the Far East  It was part of the 15th Army and the 18th Rifle Corps on 22 June 1941. 260th Rifle Brigade commander Colonel Ignat Vetvitsky became acting division commander in late April, and turned over command to Colonel Stepan Kolomiets, a recent graduate of a course at the Higher Military Academy, in mid-December 1943. Kolomiets was promoted to major general on 13 September 1944, but was relieved of command on 16 July 1945 for \\"indecisiveness in restoring discipline to units of the division.\\" He was replaced by 3rd Rifle Division commander Major General Pavel Dyomin, who led the division during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.  Soviet invasion of Manchuria  Operations of the 15th Army in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, 9‚Äì17 August 1945 In the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the division participated in the attack across the Amur River conducted by the 2nd Far Eastern Front, known in Soviet historiography as the Sungari Offensive. The 15th Army was tasked with making the main attack of the front with its three forward rifle divisions: the 34th, 361st and 388th. With the 203rd Tank Brigade, the 34th was positioned near Blagoslovennoye, tasked with launching the rightmost of the three attacks of the 15th Army. The 34th and the 203rd Tank Brigade were to cross the Amur, capturing Luobei and the Japanese Xingshanzhen fortified region before linking up with the 361st and 388th Divisions at Jiamusi on the Sungari River. The Soviet forces faced the Japanese 14th Border Guards Unit at Xingshanzhen and the 134th Infantry Division at Jiamusi. Soviet troops of the 15th Army crossing the Sungari aboard a monitor of the Amur Flotilla during the Sungari Offensive Operations began at 01:00 on 9 August, when the divisions of the 15th Army sent reconnaissance detachments and advanced battalions to capture major islands in the Amur. These were captured and in the predawn hours, reconnaissance parties crossed to the southern bank of the river. During the day positions on the islands and on the southern bank were consolidated, as main forces concentrated to cross the Amur in force. The operations were hindered by heavy rains, high water, and mud. On the night of 9‚Äì10 August, the divisions of the 15th Army conducted reconnaissance-in-force on Japanese strongpoints on the south bank, and late on 10 August an advanced regiment from the 34th captured the village of Lopei, reconnoitering strongpoints to the south. The main force of the division and the 203rd Tank Brigade crossed the river at Lopei around this time, and advanced to the south after bypassing the Xingshanzhen fortified region, leaving a small detachment behind to reduce it. The fortified region fell within three days after artillery bombardment and airstrikes forced the Japanese to retreat either towards Jiamusi or the mountains west of Xingshanzhen. The advance of the division towards Jiamusi was stymied by formidable Japanese opposition south of Xingshanzhen, which was outflanked by a 14 August amphibious landing of the 83rd Rifle Regiment of the 34th and another regiment from the 361st Division by ships of the Amur Flotilla near Huachuan on the Sungari, north of Jiamusi. This movement forced the Japanese defenders to retreat to Jiamusi. The latter was captured by the 361st and 388th on 17 August, after which the 15th Army continued to pursue the retreating Japanese until 21 August. = Postwar = It became part of the 5th Rifle Corps from 3 September 1945. For its combat service, it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 14 September 1945. In the fall of 1945, the division became part of the Transbaikal-Amur Military District at Vyazemsky.

Bailey House, a.k.a. Cedar Lane Farm, is a historic cottage in Lamar, Mississippi, USA. Location The house is located at 1577 Early Grove Road in Lamar, a small town in Marshall County, Mississippi. It is surrounded by 844 acres of land on the property, including some acres in Fayette County, Tennessee, an adjacent county. History The land upon which the house was built originally belonged to the Chickasaw Nation. In the 1830s, it was acquired by two land speculators, Thomas Mull and Samuel Reeves. By the early 1840s, the two speculators sold it to Dr Isham G. Bailey (1813-1885), a \\"prominent doctor and planter\\" from Lincoln County, Tennessee. The house was built for Bailey from 1842 to 1855. However, some sources suggest the speculators may have sold the land to a first owner in the 1840s, who built the house in 1842 and sold it to Bailey in the 1850s. Either way, the house was designed as a hip roofed cottage in the Greek Revival and Italianate architectural styles. Bailey lived in the house with his wife, Susan Bird Bailey (1822-1864), their two sons, Neal T. Bailey and Cullen R. Bailey, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Nancy. Bailey also owned African slaves, who are buried in Bailey Cemetery. After the American Civil War, Bailey's slaves became sharecroppers on the property. When Bailey died in 1885, the house was inherited by his brother-in-law William M. Parr, husband of Bailey's sister Louisa (1832-1892). Later, it was inherited by their daughter, Jennie Parr, and their granddaughter, Mrs Boyd Burnette. The house was used as a summer retreat owned by the Bailey family until 1985. The house was acquired by James K. Dobbs, III in 1985. Dobbs remodelled the house. Architectural significance The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since August 30, 2001.

It is seen in the philosophy of Ubuntu and the works of figures such as Nelson Mandela which do not advocate any form of supremacy or the elevation of self above the community. Development Antinarcissism was first introduced by Francis Pasche in 1964 within the theoretical debate that initially sought out to define narcissism and describe its role in psychic development. Pasche described the concept as a centrifugal investment, in which the subject tends to be divested of self, to give up their own substance and reserves of love, independent of any economic factors. Christopher Bollas introduced the concept of antinarcissism to describe a self-limiting kind of narcissist who refuse to develop themselves or use their talents,Tod Sloan, Damaged Life (2002) p. 116 so as to maintain their exaggerated sense of self-importance in defeat. \\"This anti-elaborative person 'stews in his own juice' and adamantly refuses to nurture himself\\".Bollas, quoted in N. Symington, Narcissism (2003) p. 113 The antinarcissist may preserve a hostile, even sadistic, core behind a self-effacing facade of care and consideration for others.A. Gratch, If Men could Talk (2009) Andr√© Green similarly wrote of antinarcissism as a negative narcissism that seeks self- destructively to abolish the ego.A. M. Cooper et al ed., Psychoanalysis on the Move () p. 79 This is part of his notion of dual narcissism, which is likely to be mapped onto the irreducible dualism of life and death drives, opposing the concept of positive narcissism, which aims to reach unity, and negative narcissism, one that strives toward the zero level and aims at nothingness. Green's concept is akin to Francis Pasche's conception of antinarcissism, which is characterized by an object and a direction. Other formulations Fritz Wittels earlier described as antinarcissistic the tendency of two lovers to lose themselves each in the other.F.

The company's most famous product was TAZ Dubrava 14. It became defunct in 2000. History Production of buses, which were based on a wooden frame, started in Zagreb in 1930. In 1948 it adopted the name \\"Autokaroserija Zagreb\\", but production still rested on the buses based on a wooden frame. In 1950, cooperation was established with the factory FAP from Priboj, Serbia and Famos (Fabrika Motora Sarajevo) from Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and in 1954 the factory TAZ was transferred to the district Dubrava in Zagreb. In 1969, the company founded FAP Famos Beograd which included FAP, Famos and TAZ, as well as Sanos from Skopje, North Macedonia. Sanos buses were built with motors positioned at the rear, while buses Dubrava (TAZ), depending on the type, have motors located on the front or rear. Both Sanos and Dubrava had a similar design for the middle part of the body, while the difference in physical appearance of both brands' was the front side of the bus body. In the same year collaboration has been with the company Daimler-Benz making model range was based on new technologies. In 1980 the factory employed 1,200 people and produced an average of 500-600 vehicles (up 900), and buses exported to, among others, China, Finland, Egypt and others. In 1991, when Croatia gained its independence and disconnected from Yugoslavia, production began to decline sharply, and in the late 1990s has been stopped completely which resulted from, among others, a reduction in the home market.http://www.teretna- vozila.com/tehnika/107-povijest-izrade-autobusa-u-hrvatskoj-.html Products TAZ Neretva =Models= *TAZ Neretva *TAZ 1419 *TAZ 1427 *TAZ Dubrava References Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1930 Category:Truck manufacturers of Croatia Category:Bus manufacturers of Croatia Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 2000 Category:2000 disestablishments in Croatia Category:Croatian brands Category:Companies based in Zagreb Category:1930 establishments in Croatia Category:Engine manufacturers of Croatia Category:Defunct companies of Croatia ","title":"Tvornica Autobusa Zagreb"},{"id":"47736061","title":"New Journey to the West"},{"id":"47736064","text":"is a 2011 Japanese thriller film directed by Eisuke Nait≈ç in his directorial debut.

He is considered as the finder of the Russian meteoritics. Stojkoviƒá was the president of Kharkiv University from 1807 to 1809 and from 1811 to 1813.http://210years.karazin.ua/en/page/rectors/index.html  Early life and education  Stojkoviƒá was born in Ruma, then part of the Austrian Empire (now modern day Serbia) on 20 September 1773. He finished grammar school in his native village of Ruma in Srem. From 1789 to 1794 he attended the √âcole polythechnique at Buda and afterwards, till 1798, the University of G√∂ttingen. His education (at Buda and G√∂ttingen) was funded by the Metropolitan of the Serbian Orthodox Church at Sremski Karlovci -- Stevan Stratimiroviƒá‚Äîand subsequently in Sremski Karlovci itself, where Stojkoviƒá proposed to take orders. Upon graduation and on returning home, however, he abandoned the idea in favor of his academic and scientific careers. It was during his studies at the University of Budapest, where he was inspired by lectures and it was there that he determined to devote himself to natural science, mathematics, physics and astronomy. He received PhD at the University of G√∂ttingen where he also graduated. Stojkoviƒá took his undergraduate degree in philosophy in 1796, and for a time pursued the study of philosophy and natural science at the University of G√∂ttingen. He graduated in 1798 with a PhD in Philosophy and Natural Science. He became a member of the Mineralogical Society in Jena. Mainly through the influence of Dositej Obradoviƒá he turned his attention to literature and science, and during the years 1801 and 1804 made a special study of astronomy. It was during his university days that he began his researches in physics which led to his great treatise on that subject. This work‚ÄîFizika‚Äîwas published in 1801-1804 in three volumes. This work entitled Stojkoviƒá to rank as one of the greatest of those who took part in the development of early modern physics of which Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was the founding father along with Kepler, Galileo, and others, before him. It also added credibility to Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's reforms. Stojkoviƒá wrote the three-volume tome with the common man in mind, using the vernacular idiom rather than the antiquated. From Professor to Rector Severyn Osipoviƒá Potocki secured him in 1799 as professor of physics‚Äîits first‚Äîat the University of Kharkiv (1805-1813) and within a short period he became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and served as the university's rector (1807-1808 and 1811-1813). He was already acquainted with Pierre Charles Le Monnier and his son-in-law, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, which had become part of the Institut de France (1795) and through their work in astronomy Stojkoviƒá decided to make Meteor Science his life's work. As a member of the newly instituted commission of education at the new university, he rendered invaluable service to his adopted country (Imperial Russia) for the next several years. From 1821 until 1829 he was a professor of geology at St. Petersburg and he corresponded with members of the Geological Society of France (1830) and influenced the work of the next generation of geologists, Ami Bou√© (1794-1881), Gerard Paul Deshayes (1795-1875) and Jules Desnoyers (1800-1887). Before Charles Lyell (1797-1875), Stojkoviƒá advocated a study of the causes or forces now in action in order to illustrate the past. In 1824 a new version of the New Testament appeared in modern Serbian vernacular. This was translated by Atanasije Stojkoviƒá, and was issued in Cyrillic character by the Russian Bible Society at Petrovgrad (St. Peterburg). Stojkoviƒá was known in Imperial Russia, Austrian and Ottoman empires as one of the most enlightened and zealous teachers of the time. As professor of physics, and regent of schools, Stojkoviƒá was the ornament of the University of Khirkiv during the time he was there. He published improved editions of several scholastical and philological works. He wrote books in Russian on the foundation of physics and physical astronomy,. In Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, where the Tunguska event on 30 June 1908 took place, a hill is named after Atanasije Stojkoviƒá. Teodor Pavloviƒá (1804-1854) wrote and published a detailed biography of Atanasije Stojkoviƒá, Russian Emperor's Governmental Counselor.  Published works  It was during his university days that he began his researches in physics which led to his great treatise on that subject. This work‚ÄîFizika‚Äîwas published in 1801-1804 in three volumes. This work entitled Stojkoviƒá to rank as one of the greatest of those who took part in the development of early modern physics of which Leibnitz was the founding father along with Kepler, Galileo, and others, before him. It also added credibility to Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's reforms. Stojkoviƒá wrote the three-volume tome with the common man in mind, using the vernacular idiom rather than the antiquated. In 1800, Stojkoviƒá's first Serbian novel Kandor or Revelation of Egyptian mysteries shows the clear influences of 18th century Egyptomany‚Äîsuch as was mostly fostered by Karl von Eckartshausen and by Freemasonry and other similar societies. He was author of the first Serbian language book about physics and member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The first book presented to the library of Matica Srpska were presented by Stojkoviƒá. In his literature works he used Slavonic-Serbian language and belongs to the group of authors who brought German version of Enlightenment to Serbs. After completing his education Stojkoviƒá moved to Harkov, Russia. He died in Harkov on 2 June 1832. While in Imperial Russia, he held the position of Russian-Emperor's Governmental Counselor. His treatise on Physics (Fizika) and New Testament translation were written in the Slavoserbian vernacular and not the Serbo-Slavonic language of the chancellery and private correspondences of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Stojkoviƒá was awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir.

It was proposed by Ivan Lyon following the success of Operation Jaywick. A precursor to Operation Rimau, it was an ambitious plan by Ivan Lyon to sabotage Japanese military operations in the Pacific by using so called 'Snake Boats'; a craft made to look like an Asian junk, which were to be built in Melbourne, Australia. A number of folboats and fifteen one-man submersible canoes, called ‚ÄòSleeping Beauties‚Äô (SBs) were to be deployed from the junks. The operation was to be formed and launched from the Allies‚Äô strategic area of the Nautilus islands. Addendum to the above. ‚ÄòSleeping Beauties‚Äô were the adopted codename, they were Motor Submersible Canoes (MSC's) electrically propelled but could be sailed or paddled.Cockleshell Canoes Whilst the SBs were to be British, they planned to use folboats (Folding kayak)s built in Melbourne, Australia, as Lyon's 2IC, Lieutenant Donald Davidson RNVR, RANVR, was not happy with the British folboats brought over and used for Operation Jaywick. They had a lot of trouble simply putting them together, then Lyon's was damaged beyond proper repair when he collided with Davidson‚Äôs during a try-out. As the Melbourne Hoehn design MKIII folboat became very well regarded for performance by Australian Commandos and proved to be very reliable in various sea and river operations, they were chosen and used for Operation Rimau (Rimau was formerly known as 'The Second Singapore Raid' before official secrecy was lifted).Attestation by 7 commissioned officers of 'Z' Special Unit that Hoehn folboats were used in Operation Rimau. NAA K1214-123/1/06 With the preparation for Hornbill and future Australian based raids, three other small portable craft designs were submitted to the army, namely by Slazengers, Webb and Barr, but all were rejected mainly for poor seaworthiness and lack of manoeverability. Serviceman Sapper Webb's 'collapsible canoe', of which 20 were built by Hedleys Folboat section for army testing, were found to be extremely unstable in any but flat water and also infringed Hoehn's patent.

Operation The island of Ternate had been occupied by Japan since 1942. The Sultan sent several islanders to Australian Army headquarters on Morotai Island asking to be rescued. The Dutch were enthusiastic about the mission. The mission had been requested by the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration who was, according to Dick Horton \\"embarrassed that the Sultan...had been captured by the Japanese ... and was being held hostage in his own castle\\". The mission was authorised by General Douglas MacArthur who was worried about the Sultan's life and his wives. The Sultan had been sympathetic to the Allied cause. The Allied contingent consisted of eight Australians from Z Special Unit, and three Dutch officers and a Timorese corporal. The mission left Morotai on 8 April 1945 aboard two Australian crewed US Navy patrol boats and landed on the northern coast of Hiri Island, two kilometres north of Ternate. They went to the coastal village of Kulaba after a six-hour trek. Members of the unit rescued the Sultan along with his two wives, eight children and retinue of courtiers and relatives. Several boatloads of Japanese soldiers arrived the next day resulting in a shooting fight which resulted in the death of three Japanese and Australian officer Lieutenant George Bosworth.George Bosworth's service record accessed 15 September 2013 Warrant Officer Dick Perry assumed command and attacked the remaining Japanese who were all killed. The sultan and his family were taken to Morotai by PT boat where the Sultan spoke with MacArthur. They were then settled in the Queensland town of Wacol until the end of the war.

It requests non-Muslims among both humans and jinn to produce either a chapter or multiple chapters like those within the holy book, with the aim of proving the Quran's superiority over any work. The Quran says that this is impossible to achieve. Challenge types Non-Muslims are challenged to produce a \\"statement\\" or speech similar to the Quran one verse, and challenged to produce either one or ten similar chapters in others. Another verse states that neither humans nor jinn could create a book like it, even if they were working together. Some of the verses of Quran which mentioned the challenge: * ‚ÄúAnd if you all are in doubt about what I have revealed to My servant, bring a single chapter like it, and call your witnesses besides God if you are truthful (24) But if you do not do this, and you can never do this, then fear the Fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers and which shall have men and stones for fuel‚Äù (Quran 2:23-24) * ‚ÄúOr do they say that he has invented it? Say (to them), ‚ÄòBring ten invented chapters like it, and call (for help) on whomever you can besides God, if you are truthful.‚Äù (Quran 11:13) * ‚ÄúSay: ‚ÄòIf all mankind and the jinn would come together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce its like even though they exerted all and their strength in aiding one another.‚Äù (Quran 17:88)  Said about the challenge  Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb, in his book \\" Mohammedanism: An Historical Survey\\" said: \\"But the Meccans still demanded of him a miracle, and with remarkable boldness and self confidence Mohammad appealed as a supreme confirmation of his mission to the Koran itself. Like all Arabs they were the connoisseurs of language and rhetoric. Well, then if the Koran were his own composition other men could rival it. Let them produce ten verses like it. If they could not (and it is obvious that they could not), them let them accept the Koran as an outstanding evident miracle\\" Dr.Maurice Bucaille author of ‚ÄúThe Bible,the Quran and Science‚Äù said in page 86 of his book: \\" The above observation makes the hypothesis advanced by those who see Muhammad as the author of the Qur'an quite untenable. How could a man, from being illiterate, become the most important author, in terms of literary merit,in the whole of Arabic literature? How could he then pronounce truths of a scientific nature that no other human being could possibly have developed at the time, and all this without once making the slightest error in his pronouncements on the subject? The ideas in this study are developed from a purely scientific point of view. They leadto the conclusion that it is inconceivable for a human being living in the Seventh century A.D. to have made statements in the Qur'an on a great variety of subjects that do not belong to his period and for them to be in keeping with what was to be known only centuries later. For me, there can be no human explanation to the Qur'an.\\"  Challengers  While the Quran itself does not explain what parameters people are meant to judge works attempting to meet the challenge by, but Implicitly the challenge in the first place about the rhetoric of the Qur‚Äôan and its unique style in the Arabic language, at a time in history when eloquence and poetry was most highly prized in the Arabian Peninsula, Allah revealed the Quran of miraculous exposition to Prophet Mohammad, eloquence was the most suitable miracle for him. Also it was notable aspect of the Quran. During descending of Quran, it first challenged the literary figures of the Arabian Peninsula and then all the people throughout the ages and at every level of knowledge and understanding until the judgment Day, Islamic scholars state that the challenge can never be fulfilled, as no one can compete with the wisdom of God. This view holds that the Quran is the most perfect book to ever exist. Muslims believe that this challenge was unable to be fulfilled in the era of Muhammad, and will remain unfulfilled until the end times. Some scholars attribute this to divine intervention, stating that God will prevent all those who attempt it from achieving their goal. A number of people, both atheists and members of other religions, have nonetheless attempted to fulfill the challenge, and others have created their own works to meet it. The True Furqan, a Christian work written in Arabic mirroring and published in 1999, is one such attempt. Iranian scientist Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi is quoted criticizing Mohammad > You are talking about a work which recounts ancient myths, and which at the > same time is full of contradictions.

Operation Sabre was directed at the Hong Kong to Saigon telephone cable, and carried out by XE4 , which was towed to within of the Mekong Delta by the submarine HMS Spearhead. Steered by Vernon Ginger Coles XE4 looked for the two telephone cables by using a towed grapnel. She eventually snagged the first cable, and managed to haul it about off the seabed. XE4's diver, Sub-Lieutenant K.M. Briggs, used the net/cable cutter to sever it. The second cable was soon found as well, and was severed by the second diver, Sub-Lieutenant A. Bergius. Two divers were carried due to the operating rule that a diver should not spend more than 20 minutes in depths over and no more than 10 minutes over . XE4 and Spearhead returned to Labuan on 3 August 1945. Lieutenant Maxwell H.

Securing the coast southeast of Manila would complete the Japanese encirclement of the capital and would act as a diversionary attack from the Japanese main invasion force from the north. Disposition of forces Lamon Bay is a large bay on the eastern shore of Luzon, south of Manila. However, in December prevailing winds made it a poor landing site and it was isolated from Manila by the Tayabas Isthmus. The Lamon Bay invasion force was led by Lt General Susumu Morioka, and consisted of 7000 men of the IJA 16th Division. Morioka called for a three-prong landing at Mauban, Atimonan, and Siain, with his forces to advance immediately upon landing along Route 1 towards Laguna de Bay without waiting to secure the narrow landing site. The invasion force departed Amami ≈åshima on 17 December in 24 transports only six hours after the Lingayen Bay invasion force sailed from Taiwan. The Lamon Bay force was escorted by only four destroyers and four minesweepers, but en route they were joined by Rear Admiral Kyuji Kubo with one light cruiser, two destroyers, two minesweepers and one minelayer from the Legaspi operation. On 23 December, the convoy was sighted by , but the American submarine was unable to cause any damage. On the morning of 24 December the convoy reached Lamon Bay. American opposition to these landings was highly disorganized. The area was nominally under the control of Major General George M. Parker and the South Luzon Force with the Philippine Commonwealth Army's 41st Division and part of the 51st Division. Much of the remainder of the 51st Division had been moved south to counter the Japanese invasion of Legaspi. Other troops were still in the process of moving into position when the Japanese landed, and suffered from lack of artillery. What little artillery the South Luzon Force possessed was all based on the west coast and MacArthur refused Parker‚Äôs request for additional guns several times. The Lamon Bay invasion force consisted of the following ships: * 1 light cruiser () * 1 heavy cruiser () * 6 destroyers (, , , , , ) * 1 minelayer (Aotaka) * 2 minesweepers (W-7, W-8) * 1 gunboat/minelayer (Ikushima Maru) * 4 gunboats (Busho Maru, Keiko Maru, Kanko Maru, Myoken Maru) * 2 subchasers (Shonan Maru No. 17, Takunan Maru No. 5) * 1 netlayer (Fukuei Maru No. 15) * 20 Imperial Japanese Army transports (Bengal Maru, Dainichi Maru, Durban Maru, Kaimei Maru, Kayo Maru, Kitano Maru, Kofuku Maru, Lisbon Maru, Nagato Maru, Nichiren Maru, Ryoka Maru, Ryuyo Maru, Shinsei Maru, Shinshu Maru, Taian Maru, Tamon Maru No. 5, Tatsuno Maru, Tofuku Maru, Toyama Maru, Toyohashi Maru) * 4 Imperial Japanese Navy transports (Hakusan Maru, Kimishima Maru, Myoko Maru, Senko Maru) The landing Lamon Bay landings on December 24, 1941 The first Japanese detachment to land was the 2nd Battalion of the 20th Infantry Regiment under Lt Col Nariyoshi Tsunehiro at Mauban. Coming ashore at dawn on 24 December under cover by aircraft provided by the seaplane carrier , the Japanese immediately came under attack by the Philippine 1st Infantry, which was dug in on the beach. American aircraft also attacked the transport convoy. However, by 0800 the Philippine Army had been pushed off the beach and by 0830 the town of Mauban was secured. The Philippine Army fell back five miles to the west, halting the Japanese advance towards Lucban and the south shore of Laguna de Bay at 1430. The second detachment, with the 1st Battalion of the 20th infantry regiment landed without opposition at Sianin to cover the left flank of the main invasion force, and to act as a reserve. One company was sent along the Manila Railroad to Tayabas Bay and the main force moved southeast to join with the Kimura Detachment, which was moving northwest from Legaspi. The columns joined on 27 December, cut off their escape route of the survivors of the Philippine 51st Division who were still retreating from Legaspi. Morioka‚Äôs main force came ashore two miles south of Atimonan. This included the bulk of the 20th Infantry, 16th Reconnaissance Regiment, and 22nd Field Artillery. The 20th Infantry occupied Atimonan by 1100 despite stubborn resistance by the Philippine Army, while the 16th Reconnaissance bypassed the town and pushed across the mountains to Malicbuy where the 2nd Battalion of the Philippine 52nd Infantry was still in the process of setting up defenses. With assistance of bombers from the IJAAF 8th Air Regiment, the 16th Reconnaissance quickly overwhelmed the defenders. The next American defensive line was set up at a river near Binahaan, about four miles to the west of Malicbuy. However, by late afternoon, Morioka‚Äôs main forces had completed mopping up operations in Atimonan, and the Japanese were thus able to bring their full force against the American position at Binahaan. The Americans retreated under cover of darkness along Route 1 to Pagbilao, with the Japanese in pursuit. Consequences By the evening of 24 December, the Japanese had successfully landed at Lamon Bay, and at the cost of only 84 killed and 184 wounded had completed its encirclement of the approaches to Manila from the south. To the north, the Lingayen Gulf invasion forces had similarly achieved its objectives in securing the northern and eastern approaches to Manila. General Masaharu Homma, who had a poor opinion of the quality of the IJA 16th Division based on its combat record in China, expressed considerable surprise at the success. By evening of 24 December, General Homma transferred his staff ashore at Bauang, where he set up the IJA 14th Army HQ in preparation for the final drive on Manila.

He was elected to Parliament as MP for Nadroga-Navosa Province, in the western part of the island of Viti Levu, in the two general elections of 1977, representing the Alliance Party.

Lal, Islands of Turmoil, op. cit., p.94 In May 1993, together with far-right ethnic nationalist Sakeasi Butadroka, he launched the \\"Viti Levu Council of Chiefs\\", \\"in opposition to the Great Council of Chiefs, dominated by the chiefs from the eastern provinces\\". The movement, largely ignored, soon faded and disappeared.Brij V. Lal, Islands of Turmoil, op. cit., p.101Gopal Nair, \\"Rethinking Fiji Coups: Corporate Domination and an Unseen Order\\", University of Western Sydney, 2010, p.183 During the coup d'√©tat in 2000, orchestrated by indigenous nationalist George Speight, Gavidi led a delegation to negotiate with Speight for the establishing of political autonomy for the western provinces, and threatened secession if it were not granted. Speight's civilian coup was eventually countered by the military, democratic rule was restored, and Gavidi's move for western autonomy came to nothing.\\"Fiji Coup: Too Many Chiefs‚Ä¶\\", Scoop.co.nz, 9 June 2000 In 2014, he led a movement for the secession of the Nadroga-Navosa Province from the rest of Fiji. On 10 October, the movement declared the foundation of the \\"Nadroga-Navosa Sovereign Christian State\\", with its own flag, and a Cabinet sworn in on 4 November. Its capital was declared to be the village of Cuvu, and Gavidi was proclaimed as its President. The secessionists explained their actions by their rejection of Fiji's new Constitution in 2013 which enshrined the principle of a secular state. The proclamation of secession was, however, rejected and condemned by the province's chiefly families. The members of the secessionist \\"government\\" were eventually arrested in August 2015 and charged with sedition and causing unrest. By that time, Gavidi had died in hospital, in April at the age of 71, and been buried in Cuvu.\\"Ratu Osea‚Äôs Sham\\", Fiji Sun, 8 November 2014\\"SODELPA: No Link To Rebels\\", Fiji Sun, 10 May 2015\\"On snake gods and sedition in Fiji\\", Michael J.

It ran in conjunction with Operation Locust, and resulted in the capture and execution of Leonard Siffleet in October 1943, producing one of the most famous photographs of the war. Mission Sergeant Leonard Siffleet's execution in Aitape, 1943 The mission was undertaken by the Dutch section of the Inter-Allied Services Department (later known as NEFIS). Its aim was to establish a coast-watching station in the hills above Hollandia in Dutch New Guinea, recently occupied by the Japanese. It ran in conjunction with Operation Locust, which would focus on observation in New Guinea. The team consisted of Sergeant H.N. Staverman, Corporal D.J. Topman, two Dutch East Indies (Indonesian) privates, H. Pattiwal and M. Reharing, and radio operator Sergeant Len Siffleet, an Australian of Dutch descent. In February 1943 the Locust and Whiting teams flew to Bena Bena and began a trek through the jungle to Aitape on the New Guinea coast. They reached Lumi airstrip on 14 June 1943, having travelled over 500 miles by foot and 230 miles by boat. On 9 July the Whiting party separated and headed off to Hollandia with 66 native carriers. In mid-September the team had reached Aitape. A month later Staverman and Pattiwal were ambushed while on a reconnaissance mission and Staverman was killed. Pattiwal escaped back to camp to join the others. The three remaining patrol men attempted to escape south. During a meal break at Wantipi the men were surrounded by a group of more than 100 locals. Siffleet fired on the attackers, wounding one, and managed to break free. He was quickly caught and, along with his companions, was handed over to the Japanese. The men were interrogated and beaten then taken to a Japanese outpost at Malol. After two weeks the prisoners were transferred to Aitape. =Execution= A photograph found on the body of a dead Japanese soldier showing Private (Pte) Reharin, member of the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) Forces wearing a blindfold about to be beheaded with a sword by Yunome Kunio On 24 October 1943, around 15:00, Siffleet and two fellow prisoners were marched to Aitape Beach to a pre-dug hole in the sand. Kneeling before a crowd of Japanese and New Guinean onlookers and wearing blindfolds, the three prisoners were beheaded and buried. A photo of Sergeant Leonard G. Siffleet of M Special Unit being beheaded by a Japanese soldier, Yasuno Chikao, on 24 October 1943 shows him holding a sword over a haggard looking prisoner. It was found by American troops in 1944. The photo continues to be misrepresented as other victims of Japanese executions but its subject was positively identified as Siffleet in 1945.

Hawthorn Devenish-Meares, a Launceston Grammar recruit, was a key position player. He came to Hawthorn from Tasmania in 1967, along with the more high profile Peter Hudson, with whom he boarded. A broken bone in his foot, sustained in a practice match, stopped him from making his debut in 1967. He played eight senior games for Hawthorn, all of them in succession in the 1968 VFL season. His debut, against South Melbourne in round two, finished in a draw. In round eight against reigning premiers Richmond he thought he had played in another draw, memorably kicking a goal in the dying minutes which put Hawthorn level on the scoreboard. Having come on as a reserve, Devenish- Meares kicked the ball from 60-yards out and it was shepherded through by Hudson, for what would be the only goal of his VFL career. The sides remained tied on the scoreboard when the siren sounded two-minutes later. Soon after in the change rooms, when the players were celebrating a drawn game that they had been expected to lose, even singing the team song, it was revealed that the score on the board was an error and Richmond had actually won by a point. It transpired that a behind earlier in the fourth quarter by Hawthorn's Peter Chilton had been given two-points instead of one.

The television news coverage of the main events in Brazil and in the world, the production of special and investigative reports. It has reporters in all states of Brazil, through RecordTV affiliates, and also has international correspondents in its offices located in the United States (New York and Washington D.C.), Europe (London and Lisbon), Asia (Tokyo) and the Middle East (Jerusalem). Jornal da Record is also presented by the RecordTV Internacional, reaching more than 150 countries. Outstanding awards are including Esso Award, Trophy Press, Vladimir Herzog Award and APCA Award.  History  Jornal da Record was premiered on September 24, 1974, as replacement for Xecap (based on Xecap 1000, a radio news program on R√°dio Record), and hosted by H√©lio Ansaldo. In 1976, the program was renamed as Jornal da Noite. In 1985, Jornal da Noite renamed again as Jornal da Record, presented by Ricardo Carvalho, with reporters comments are Celso Ming and Paulo Markun, with reporting by S√≠lvia Poppovic. In 1988, Ricardo Carvalho was replaced by Jos√© Nello Marques. In 1989, Jornal da Record was presented by Carlos Nascimento, who was the editor-in-chief at the time and anchor of the attraction. The news program was also presented by Wellington de Oliveira and Am√°lia Rocha. The REI had a modest structure at the time and was on the verge of bankruptcy, but even so the television news was a hit with the opinion-forming public and was 2 hours long. Jornal da Record was broadcast on S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, and Bras√≠lia. Nascimento remained until 1990 at the station, when he returned to Rede Globo. Maria Lydia Fl√¢ndoli took over as presenter of the newscast that from 1990 to 1993 had two editions: regional with local news and national news with national and international news and remained as presenter until 1991, when Salette Lemos went on to present the program, It was also presented by √ännio Pesce and K√°tia Maranh√£o, comments were by Lucas Mendes (international) and Kitty Balieiro (sports). The following year, Carlos Bianchini, coming from the Rede Manchete, takes the attraction and starts to divide the bench with Adriana de Castro, leaving the presentation in 1994. It was then replaced by Carlos Oliveira, who shared the presentation of the television news with Adriana de Castro until March 1996. In 1995, Chico Pinheiro, who was from Rede Bandeirantes, took over the program. In the short time that he presented the television news, Chico got involved in controversies with the owners of the station, accusing them of censorship, the comments of Adriana de Castro (direct from Rio de Janeiro), Ant√¥nio Augusto (direct from Bras√≠lia), Marcelo Pontes (politics), Bernardo Carvalho (international) and Luiz Nassif (economy). In replacement, Adriana de Castro became the sole anchor until June 1997, when B√≥ris Casoy left SBT and TJ Brasil and signed a contract with Rede Record. In December 2005, Casoy was fired from the broadcaster on the grounds that it was no longer in compliance with Record journalism standards. Casoy retaliated, saying he had been fired under pressure from the PT. In its place, Heleine Heringer, the former weather newscast host in the time of Boris, temporarily took over as news anchor. On January 30, 2006, just few months after the resignation of Boris Casoy, the new \\"Jornal da Record\\" was launched, presented by Celso Freitas and Adriana Ara√∫jo, which had a slight editorial reform, making it more wide and with the presence of a new team of reporters in a total of 15 coming from Rede Globo, since in 2005 the station had lost the same number of reporters to the team formation of the recently released SBT Brasil. On May 7, 2009, Record announced in an official communication the hiring of journalist Ana Paula Padr√£o for four years. Ana Paula, who previously working for Globo and SBT, has presented the new \\"Jornal da Record\\" with Celso Freitas since June 29, replacing Adriana Ara√∫jo, who becomes the new correspondent for the station in New York. While Ana Paula Padr√£o had not yet debuted, Janine Borba temporarily took over the television newsstand alongside Marcos Hummel. The newscast was being presented in chroma key, due to the reforms in the newsroom's writing, for the debut of the \\"new\\" Jornal da Record and other programs such as the Fala Brasil and the journalistic C√¢mera Record. On June 29, 2009, the program went on the air again, with Celso Freitas and Ana Paula Padr√£o. From September 27, 2010, the program began broadcasting in HD. On November 1, 2010, Ana Paula Padr√£o and Adriana Araujo interviewed for the JR, Dilma Rousseff, who, the day before, had come out victorious from the polls for the first term of president of Brazil. The interview was Dilma's first after the victory, and was also more than exclusive; since the end of the military regime, no democratically elected president had given an interview to another station other than Rede Globo. On July 11, 2011, the newscast began to be presented at 19:40, coming out of the direct confrontation with the Jornal Nacional. During October 2011, Record transmitted the Pan American Games in Guadalajara, and Jornal da Record has to be presented at 18.20; with Ana Paula Padr√£o and the staff assembled in Guadalajara bringing the news of the day of the competition, and, Celso Freitas in S√£o Paulo presenting a summary of the news from Brazil and the world. After the end of the transmissions of the multi-sport event held in Guadalajara, Mexico, the television news was re-presented at 8:30 p.m., again confronting the Jornal Nacional. Record ended gradually with the rotation of presenters on Saturdays in Jornal da Record. It started from February 11, 2012, when Eduardo Ribeiro became effective in presenting JR the last day of the week, ending the rotation of male anchors. Later, it was the turn of the end of the rotation of female anchors; on January 12, 2013 the journalist Carla Cecato became double with Eduardo Ribeiro on Saturdays, but left the function to return to the Foreign Brazil in early 2014. Janine Borba, Thalita Oliveira and Adriana Ara√∫jo occupy the position. On March 20, 2013, Ana Paula Padr√£o presented for the last time JR. She canceled the contract signed in 2009 that would have another month. Journalist Adriana Ara√∫jo, who preceded Ana Paula in the women's presentation of Jornal da Record, was effective and rejoined with Celso Freitas on March 26, 2013. On March 23, 2015, Jornal da Record went to the late opening of 20:30. The station is criticized for broadcasting the news after all the other major networks on prime time. On November 18, 2015, R7, Record's journalism portal, an online version for the newscast, JR Online, to be presented every Wednesday, always after the end of the issue on TV.

Built in 1837, it was home to the University of Holly Springs, the oldest university in Mississippi, from 1838 to 1839. It was home to a short-lived Methodist medical and law school from 1839 to 1843. It reopened as the Chalmers Institute, a Presbyterian boys' school, from 1850 to 1878, when a yellow fever epidemic closed down the school. It became home to the Holly Springs Normal Institute in 1879, but closed down a few years later. In the twentieth century, it became a private residence. It has been listed by the National Register of Historic Places for its historic significance since 1982. Location The building is located on West Chulahoma Avenue in Holly Springs, a small town in Marshall County, Mississippi, in the American South. History The building was erected in 1837. It was designed as a hip-roofed two-storey building in the Federal architectural style. It was known as the Holly Springs Literary Institution in 1837. By 1838, it became known as the University of Holly Springs. As such, it was the first university in Mississippi, nine years before the foundation of the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. However, it closed down shortly after, in 1843. The building was home to a medical and law school run by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South from 1839 to 1843. It closed down in 1843 and remained unoccupied until 1847. In 1847, Reverend Samuel McKinney, an Irish-born Presbyterian minister, opened the Chalmers Institute, a boys' school. Prominent former students included George Clifton Myers (1852-1934), an influential clerk of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and Confederate Colonel William F. Taylor, who became a prosperous cotton commissioner in the post- bellum South. One of the trustees was Reverend Daniel Baker, a Presbyterian minister who went on to found Daniel Baker College and Austin College in Texas. Meanwhile, McKinney went on to serve as the first President of Austin College. In the aftermath of the American Civil War, the school reopened under the leadership of Professor W. A. Anderson until 1869. It thrived until 1878, when Holly Springs was hit by an epidemic of yellow fever. A year later, another school opened in the building: the Holly Springs Normal Institute. However, it later closed down in 1879. The building became a private residence at the outset of the twentieth century. In 2009, it was acquired by Preserve Marshall County/Holly Springs Inc., a preservationist organization whose aim is to save and restore the building. In 2013, they received US$80,000 from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History to replace the roof. Architectural significance The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 28, 1982. It is also a Mississippi Landmark. The structure was most likely built by the architect Joseph Coe, who created other buildings in the town, including the Marshall County Courthouse and Federal buildings.

History A castle was erected here sometime around 1200, built with the purpose of defending the border to the Kingdom of Bohemia; it was mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1318. The oldest part of the presently visible castle is its central round tower, erected sometime around 1300. The castle was built for the burgraves of Dohna; the burgraviate was incorporated in the Margraviate of Meissen in 1400 and in 1406 the castle was transferred by the margrave to the von B√ºnau family in gratitude for their support in the Dohna Feud. The B√ºnau family transformed the defensive castle into a residential Schloss in 1526‚Äì1575, and successive generations would expand and rebuild the Schloss in stages. It continued to be the main seat of the family for about 350 years. As a consequence of the Seven Years' War of 1756‚Äì1763 the family however lost a substantial part of their wealth and had to part with the castle which subsequently passed into the hands of the von Uckermann family. The Uckermann family owned the castle for two generations and continued the process of embellishing the estate, not least the garden. From 1830, the Schloss was used by the rulers of Saxony, the House of Wettin. Several members of the royal family lived in the castle, including three kings: Anthony of Saxony, John of Saxony and George of Saxony. After World War I, the castle was sold and in 1933 became the seat of an association for the protection of the heritage of Saxony (). During World War II, the castle was used for safekeeping most of the collections of the Kupferstich-Kabinett (Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs) of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden or Dresden State Art Collections. Because of this, the castle and its contents were spared from destruction during the bombing of Dresden in World War II. After the war, the castle was used to house refugees before it was taken over by the state. Today it belongs to the state-owned company State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony (). It houses a museum and 35 of the rooms of the castle are open to the public. Architecture The presently visible ensemble is the product of centuries of development and rebuilding. The castle is thus a mix of styles, ranging from Gothic architecture to Classical architecture. The main portal, built in 1575, is considered one of the most valuable Renaissance portals in Saxony, The Schloss is built on a rock with storeys descending from the central, medieval round tower (with its 18th-century spire). In total, the castle has eight storeys. The castle contains around 200 rooms in total. The Baroque chapel, described as the \\"architectural and artistic highlight of the entire castle\\", is thought to have been designed by Johann George Schmidt. A formal garden lies adjacent to the castle. An English landscape garden, one of the earliest to be created in Saxony (c. 1780), has since been overgrown.

Early life Little is known with any degree of certainty regarding Edward Hart's life before 1640. Genealogical sources give place and date of birth, year and manner of emigration to North America, and first places of residence within the American colonies, but none provide documentary evidence for their assertions. A man named Edward Hart was one of the early settlers of Rhode Island having obtained a plot of land from Roger Williams and signed an agreement for the government of Providence in 1640. This man married a woman named Margaret whose surname is unknown. There is no definite evidence that this Edward Hart is the same as the Edward Hart of Flushing, Long Island, but sources generally accept that he is. Founding settler of Flushing Although there is some level of uncertainty about his prior whereabouts, there is no doubt that on October 10, 1645, Hart was one of 18 men who received a charter from the Dutch governor of New Netherland, William Kieft, to establish the town of Vlissingen (i.e., Flushing) in Long Island. Three of these men came to Flushing from Rhode Island and may have known Hart there. The others, so far as is known, came from Massachusetts, Connecticut, or other towns in Long Island. In 1642, after efforts to attract Dutch immigrants had disappointing results, the administration in New Netherland and its parent governors in Amsterdam began to accept applications from English settlers to form towns on Long Island. These settlers brought with them the forms of government common in the settlements of New England. Based on practices common in English towns, these were generally more liberal than the ones granted to New Netherland's Dutch communities and the charter granted to the applicants from Flushing was no exception. Having obtained privileges of self-government that were not granted to the towns where Dutch settlers resided, the settlers from New England were energetic in defending and where possible expanding these rights against efforts of the administration in New Amsterdam to erode them. In 1648 Hart, as one of Flushing's landholders, joined with four other men to protest the payment of tithes to the pastor of a state-sponsored church and to question the manner of choosing the town's sole magistrate, the schout, who acted as court officer, prosecutor, and sheriff. On January 17 of that year the government of New Netherland, now headed by Peter Stuyvesant summoned the five men to answer for this resistance to the authorities in New Netherland and ordered them to accept the Dutch method for electing their schout. Stuyvesant did not relent in his efforts to require the inhabitants of Flushing to support a pastor of his choosing nor did he change the method for electing a schout. However, a few months later he expanded local government by granting the town's freeholders the right to elect three additional magistrates, called schaepens, and a clerk. The election of the officials would be subject to confirmation by the New Netherland government but in practice the town's nominations of its officials were routinely accepted. Although there is some doubt about the names and terms of early clerks, it is certain that Hart was clerk in 1656 for in July of that year he signed himself clerk in responding on behalf of the town's schout and schaepens to a demand from the New Netherland government for payment of a tenth of the town's agricultural production as annual tax as provided in its charter. Hart's letter said that Flushing was \\"willing to do that which is reasonable and honest\\" and proposed an amount of produce (\\"fiftie scipple of peas and twentie-five of wheat\\") which was apparently acceptable. That he continued as clerk in 1657 is shown by a letter of his dated January 23, 1657, affirming the town's rights and privileges and complaining that the neighboring town of Hempstead was encroaching on its lands. Writer of the Flushing Remonstrance The next document bearing Hart's signature as clerk is the famous Flushing Remonstrance of December 27, 1657. The towns settled by immigrants from New England were generally granted charters recognizing their right to freedom of conscience but not freedom of religion. In the case of Flushing, the relevant clause granted the original patentees the right \\"to have and Enjoy the Liberty of Conscience, according of Religion; to the Custome and manner of Holland, without molestac≈çn or disturbance, from any Magistrate or Magistrates, or any other Ecclesiasticall Minister, that may extend Jurisdicc≈çn over them.\\" In practice this meant that men would not be prosecuted for religious practices that did not strongly contradict those of the Dutch Reformed Church which was the official public church in Holland. It also meant that personal beliefs that were contrary to the tenets of the established church would be tolerated so long as they were kept private and expressed only in the narrow circle of the family. Meetings for the public expression of dissenting worship would be prosecuted. Although the early settlers of Flushing complied with these strictures, some of them came into conflict with Stuyvesant and the New Netherlands government when charismatic speakers began to come among them proclaiming nonconformist beliefs. Believing that Quakers posed the most serious threat to religious and civil tranquility, the administration in New Amsterdam proclaimed that any person who took a Quaker into his home, even for a single night, would be fined fifty pounds and that any ships bringing any Quaker into the province would be confiscated. The schout, magistrates, of Flushing, along with twenty-eight other freeholders of that town and two from neighboring Jamaica recognized that they could not, in conscience, obey this regulation and signed a protest, the Remonstrance, explaining why they could not comply. The document says Quakers are not seducers of the people nor are they \\"destructive unto magistracy and ministers\\" but‚Äîalong with Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists‚Äîare members of the \\"household of faith\\" who, when they \\"come unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free ingress and egress unto our town and houses, so as God shall persuade our consciences.\\" It closes by saying that the signatories \\"desire to be true subjects both of church and state\\" according to the law of God and also to the provisions of the town's charter. The collections of colonial documents of this period contain many protests against government actions, but none of such historic import or eloquence of expression as this. The Remonstrance \\"concretely illustrates the seventeenth century practice of speaking Scripture\\" and is \\"an unusually rich display of rhetoric and fine English style.\\" It gives forceful religious arguments for tolerance of other religions and the separation of church and state. Nonetheless it is framed on Dutch law, adheres closely to legal forms, and contains nothing that might be construed as politically rebellious. Government response to the Remonstrance The signers of the Remonstrance followed correct procedure in having the town schout, Tobias Feake, submit it to the provincial schout, Nicasius de Sille. De Sille passed it on to Stuyvesant who immediately ordered de Sille to arrest and imprison Feake. A few days later‚ÄîJanuary 1, 1658‚Äîhe also ordered the arrest of two of the town's magistrates, Thomas Farrington and William Noble, and on January 3 he summoned Hart to testify. Under examination by Stuyvesant and two councilors, Hart said that the Remonstrance contained the sentiments of the community as expressed in a town meeting, that some who were not present at the meeting signed afterward, and that he did not know who called the meeting or who had drafted the document for the community's consideration. Having suffered imprisonment for three weeks Hart wrote the governor and council on January 28 requesting to be released. He acknowledged no offense and made no excuse for writing the Remonstrance but begged mercy and consideration for his \\"poore estate and Condition\\" and promised that he would \\"indeavor hereafter to walke inoffensively.\\" The council responded the same day. The record of its decision says something about his performance as town clerk and his standing in the community: > In Council received and read the foregoing petition of the imprisoned Clerk > of Vlissingen, Edward Hart, and having considered his verbal promises of > better behavior and the mediation of some inhabitants of said village, also > that he has always been an efficient officer and as an old resident is well > acquainted with divers matters; further whereas the Schout Tobias Feakx has > advised him to draw up the remonstrance recorded on the first of January and > he is burdened with a large family, The Director-General and Council forgive > and pardon his error this time on condition of his paying the costs and > misses of law. On March 26 the director-general and council passed an ordinance intended to prevent the town from ever again submitting a \\"seditious and mutinous\\" document like the Remonstrance. Saying that \\"all the late Schouts successively have manifested no small negligence,\\" it added new qualifications for the office aimed at obtaining persons \\"better versed in Dutch Practice, and somewhat conversant in both languages, the English and Dutch.\\" It also prohibited town meetings for conducting ordinary business and, in their place, instituted a town council consisting of seven persons to assist the schout and magistrates and it required the town to acquire and maintain \\"an Orthodox Minister\\" to conduct religious services. Responsibility for the Remonstrance Hart gave somewhat inconsistent statements in his interrogation by Stuyvesant, de Sille, and Tonneman, saying first that he drew up the Remonstrance on the order of those who signed it in order to record the \\"opinion of the people\\" of the town and then saying that he had prepared it before the town meeting at which he submitted it for consideration. He pleaded ignorance concerning the responsibility of any specific individuals as instigators prior to the town meeting. Pressed to explain his inconsistent testimony he said the draft he prepared prior to the meeting contained \\"what he thought to be the opinion of the people.\\" The questions submitted to Hart show that Stuyvesant and the two councilors suspected that the four town officials who signed the document (the schout, two magistrates, and Hart) bore primary responsibility for it. After interrogating the two magistrates and after the two of them and Hart had submitted apologies for their actions, the governor and councilors settled on the schout as mainly responsible. Although they singled out Feake for punishment, the ordinance they passed subsequent to the release from imprisonment and pardoning of the Hart and the magistrates maintains that all four of the town's officials were jointly at fault. It says that most of the men who signed the Remonstrance were \\"urged to subscribe by the previous signatures of the Schout, Clerk and some Magistrates.\\" Historians who have considered this subject have not agreed about who took the lead in preparing the Remonstrance and, as a result, it is not known which of its signers most inspired its moving appeal for freedom of conscience. Some maintain that the schout, Feake, was mainly responsible. Others say it was mainly Hart's doing or that, at least, the language was his. One says that the four town officials were more or less equally responsible. Many accounts say that the responsibility was communal. One author makes a case for a strong influence of Baptist beliefs among those who signed the document. Life of Edward Hart subsequent to the Remonstrance There is little information about Hart following his pardoning and release from prison. In 1660 and 1661 his name appears as a witness on deeds for transfer of land and in the latter year he was listed as a tax collector in Flushing. On April 13, 1662, Hart wrote Stuyvesant on behalf of Flushing residents to request help in dealing with three Indians \\"who demand pay for the Land wee live vpon\\" and later that year (June 26) A man whose name is given as Eduart Hart obtained a translation from the Notary Public in New Amsterdam. After that there is no assured documentary evidence regarding him. The last references to a man who is supposed to have been Hart are in records of land transfer. In 1679 a man named Robert West acquired land originally owned by an Edward Hart in Providence, R.I. and in 1707 land formerly owned by him is referred to in a deed filed by a man named William Field. It is likely but not certain that this Edward Hart is the same as the one who wrote the Remonstrance. Family of Edward Hart Hart's life after 1662 is described from inferences lacking a clear documentary trail. With his wife, Margaret, he is said to have had two sons, Thomas and Jonathan. Hart having returned to Rhode Island and then died, his wife is supposed to have remarried. Some genealogical and other sources say that Jonathan Hart died in Newtown, Long Island, in 1671, however Early Wills of Westchester County, New York, from 1664 to 1784 by William Smith Pelletreau (Francis P. Harper, New York, 1898) says that the family of one Monmouth Hart of Rye, New York, is descended from an Edmund Hart who signed the Flushing Remonstrance and that his son, Jonathan Hart, came to Rye in 1685 and subsequently married Hannah Budd. Thomas Hart is said to have married Freeborn Williams, a daughter of Roger Williams and this fact is supported by a note in The genealogical dictionary of Rhode Island by John Osborne Austin (Joel Munsells Sons, Albany, 1887). The note says that the Edward Hart who was granted land in Providence and subsequently signed the civil compact of 1640 was the husband of a woman named Margaret and the two were parents of a son named Thomas. It says that this son lived in Newport, Rhode Island, and was husband of Freeborn Williams, daughter of Roger Williams and his wife Mary. Although most sources accept that this Edward Hart is the same man as the one who drafted the Remonstrance, they offer no evidence to support their inference. Documentary evidence on the life of Edward Hart In 1789 all the records of the town of Flushing were destroyed in a fire and in 1911 a fire caused serious damage to the manuscripts of the New Netherland colony. Although no copies had been made of the Flushing documents and they were thus lost forever, many of the Dutch colonial documents had been transcribed and printed prior to the 1911 fire.

History The first English-language general medical journal was Medicina Curiosa, which was established in 1684 and ceased publication after only two issues. Among the oldest general medical journals that are still published today are the Lancet, which was established in 1823, and the New England Journal of Medicine, which was established in 1812. In 1999, Medscape launched Medscape General Medicine, the world's first online-only general medical journal.

He arrived in Fremantle aboard the Stirling with his wife and daughter, and a cargo of merchandise including a prefabricated house, 14 merinos, cattle and a pair of rabbits. He intended to settle in the area along the Swan or Canning Rivers as a farmer but found the best land was taken. Undeterred he pressed on to King George Sound and found business sites around Albany and selected land around the Kalgan River, Moorilup and on Mistaken Island. Cheyne acquired land in the Kendenup area in 1832 and Cape Riche in 1836. In 1839 Cheyne sold of his land around Kendenup to John Hassell, who developed it as Kendenup Estate. Cheyne moved permanently to Cape Riche in 1842 to trade with the crew of whalers in the area.

The company, created as a part of the Power Sector Reform Programme, was registered on 25 October 2005 under the Companies Act, 1994. The government owns 100% share of the company. DPDC started commercial operation on 1 July 2008 taking over from Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA). All the assets and liabilities of DESA were transferred to DPDC through an agreement signed in September 2008.  History  The history of power generation and distribution in Dhaka city is eventful. Tradition goes that the Nawab of Dhaka introduced electricity in Dhaka in 1901 when he installed a small generator in his residence Ahsan Manzil. Power generation for public use started in 1930 when a privately owned company M/S DEVCO developed an electricity distribution system. Private companies managed power generation and distribution system in Dhaka until the end of British rule in 1947. In 1957 the Government of Pakistan took over the private owned companies in Dhaka and in 1959 they were placed under the newly established East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA). After the liberation of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) replaced EPWAPDA's Power wing in 1972. The power generation and distribution system of Dhaka was managed by BPDB until 1991. An autonomous organisation named Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) was created by an ordinance promulgated by the President in March 1990 to improve services to the consumers and to enhance revenue collection by reducing the prevailing high system loss. DESA took over the electricity distribution system in and around Dhaka city in October 1991, but the jurisdiction of power generation remained with BPDB. Later in 1998, a subsidiary company Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (DESCO) was formed to take over a few areas of the Dhaka city from DESA. And in 2008, DESA was abolished and replaced by DPDC. At its of inception, DPDC area was about 7473 square kilometer in and around the capital city. Consequently, as per government decision, after handing over the city peripherals to Rural Electrification Board (REB) and some parts of the Metropolitan area to Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd (DESCO), DPDC area is reduced to only around 350 square kilometer, expanded in the southern part of the capital city of Dhaka and adjoining townships of Narayangonj. DESA, the ancestor of DPDC was established as part of a reform process to ensure better services to the electricity consumers, develop the power distribution system and reduce system loss. Before the setting up of DESA, the power development board suffered a system loss of 45%. DESA managed to cut it down to around 26%. But as it also became a losing concern due to various reasons, DPDC was introduced as part of the reform process to replace DESA. DPDC has managed to cut down the system loss to single digit in recent years.

Wool, 160 cm x 112 cm, Swedish History Museum, Stockholm Animal carpet, Turkey, dated to the 11th‚Äì13th century, Museum of Islamic Art, Doha Anatolian Animal carpet, 1500 or earlier, wool, symmetric knots. Pergamon Museum Inv. No. KGM 1885, 984 \\"Bat√°ri-Crivelli\\" rug, Anatolia, 15th century, Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest) Anatolian animal carpets represent a special type of pile-woven carpet, woven in the geographical region of Anatolia during the Seljuq and early Ottoman period, corresponding to the 14th‚Äì16th century. Very few animal-style carpets still exist today, and most of them are in a fragmentary state. Animal carpets were frequently depicted by Western European painters of the 14th‚Äì16th century. By comparison of the few surviving carpets with their painted counterparts, these paintings helped to establish a timeline of their production, and support our knowledge about the early Turkish carpet.  Surviving carpets  = Dragon and Phoenix carpet = A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between the fenghuang, or Chinese phoenix, and the dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet at the Pergamon Museum, Berlin. Radiocarbon dating confirmed that the \\"Dragon and Phoenix\\" carpet was woven in the mid 15th century, during the early Ottoman Empire. It is knotted with symmetric knots. The Chinese motif was probably introduced into Islamic art by the Mongols, or artists working for them, during the thirteenth century. The Dragon and Phoenix carpet lacks his original borders, and seems to be cut off at the right side. Its field is parted into two rectangular sections, each containing a yellow-ground octagon in which a Chinese dragon and a phoenix are opposed to each other in combat. Both animals are stylized in geometrical form. Their blue colours, outlined in red, contrasts well with the yellow ground of the octagon. The design of the upper octagon appears to be somewhat more compressed than the lower. The corners between the octagon and the rectangular field are filled in with red triangles and rows of white hooks on red ground, creating a reciprocal hook design. The rectangular fields are surrounded by a small guardian border showing a row of pearls in different colours. The main border has red floral tendrils composed of identical, S-like ornaments on a brown ground. The Phoenix and Dragon carpet was first described in 1881 by Julius Lessing, and Wilhelm von Bode in 1895. Since then the Dragon and Phoenix carpet has been referred to in many books on Oriental carpets. A similar fragment was discovered in Fustat, with dragon and phoenix depicted in combat on a yellow field. The animals in this fragment are depicted in red, and outlined in blue. The minor border shows a variant of the \\"kufic\\" borders known from other Seljuq period carpets. = Marby rug = Another carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby in J√§mtland province; it is now in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm. The rug was radiocarbon dated to 1300‚Äì1420. More fragments of this type were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. The Marby rug is divided into two rectangles, each containing an octagon with a tree and a pair of birds. The tree is mirrored along the horizontal middle axis of the octagon in a way which suggests its image is reflected in water. Both the Phoenix and Dragon, and the Marby rug, have additional rows of knots on their backsides. At a distance of every 6 cm, rows of loosely tied knots of red thread are woven in. Another carpet fragment from Fustat has similar additional knots. It has been suggested that these rows of knots mark the weaver's progress during a given time. On average, the additional knots are repeated every 15 rows in the Dragon and Phoenix rug. At an estimated original width of 1 m, about 3800 knots were woven between two rows of the additional red knots, consistent with the dimensions of the carpet and the number of knots a single weaver can tie in a carpet during a day.(Beselin 2011, p. 46‚Äì49) = Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum = The \\"Dragon and Phoenix\\" and the \\"Marby\\" rugs were the only existing examples of Anatolian animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the Chinese cultural revolution. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist Gregorio di Cecco: \\"The Marriage of the Virgin\\", 1423. It shows large confronted animals, each with a smaller animal inside. = Animal carpets from the Vakƒ±flar Museum = The field of an animal carpet in the Vakƒ±flar Museum, Istanbul (Inv. No. E-1) is divided into two rectangular compartments by a band similar to its borders. An octagon containing confronted animals is inscribed into each compartment. The winged animals face a stylized tree. They show a down-turned, snout-like head, to which antler-like extensions are attached, and their body is spotted. Overall, the animals more resemble fallow deer than birds, which are usually depicted on animal carpets. Deer and fallow deer are already depicted on the borders of the Pazyryk carpet, and are frequently seen on early textiles and other objects in Anatolia and Iran. Below each deer, and above the main animal, is a bird-like quadruped. Another animal carpet with a coarser design compared to the Vakƒ±flar rug is at the Mevlana Museum in Konya (Balpƒ±nar, 1988, p. 62). = Animal carpet from the Pergamon Museum = Another carpet in the Pergamon Museum was dated to before 1500 AD. It shows four double-headed quadrupeds within a rectangular field surrounded by an eight-pointed star. The uppermost star is cut off. The stars are framed by smaller octagonal ornaments, two at their sides, one each at the top and bottom of each star. A smaller guardian border separates the field from the main border, which shows stylized leaves adorning S-shaped ornaments. Smaller triangular elements of the design and the outlines of the animals are woven in offset knotting. By its colours, the carpet has been localized to Central Anatolia. On the reverse of the carpet, additional wefts can be seen meandering over two warps after about every 22 regular wefts. The additional weft changes its colour from yellow to red, roughly at the middle of the carpet. It has been interpreted to show a day's work of two weavers working besides each other. If taken as such, the number of knots woven by each weaver would amount to roughly 2,500 knots per day. (Beselin 2011, p. 50‚Äì1) See: knot density. = Bat√°ri-Crivelli fragment, Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest = The animal carpet fragment is approximately half the original size. Its field contains two large, 16-pointed star medallions of identical design which both include an eight-pointed star within an octagon. In every second segment of the medallions two birds appear, alternating with two four-legged animals. The field between the medallions is ornamented with smaller rosettes and eight-pointed stars. Each corner contains a mosque lamp ornament. In the center of the long side an octagonal smaller medallion is inserted. The Bat√°ri-Crivelli fragment resembles the \\"Dragon and Phoenix\\" and \\"Marby\\" rugs in having a yellow ground and two large medallions as the main element of design. Chromatographic analysis of the dyes revealed yellow from an undefined plant, indigo blue, madder (Rubia tinctorum) red, a blue green derived from indigo, Dyer's weed (Reseda luteola), and Dyer's sage (Salvia fruticosa), dark brown and undyed, ivory wool. During the 13th International Congress of Turkish Art, held in Budapest on 3 September 2007, the fragment was renamed in honour of Ferenc Bat√°ri, the late curator of the carpet and textile department of the museum. Other animal carpets are at the Museum of Islamic Art, Doha and in private collections.  Animal carpets in Renaissance painting  Animal-style carpets begin to appear in Italian paintings in the 14th, and continue to be depicted in Western European paintings throughout the 15th century. They represent the earliest Oriental carpets which were identified in Renaissance painting. The comparison of animal-style carpets on Renaissance paintings, for which the painter and the date of origin are often known, allows for the determination of a \\"terminus ante quem\\" date for existing carpets of similar design. Wilhelm von Bode identified a carpet on Domenico di Bartolo's 1440 painting The Marriage of the Foundlings with marked similarities to the \\"Dragon and Phoenix\\" carpet. This marks the beginning of the \\"ante quem\\" method, which was subsequently further elaborated by the \\"Berlin School\\" of History of Islamic Art. By this method, a variety of existing carpets could be dated by comparison to their painted counterparts. The illustrated rugs are generally drawn by the early Renaissance painters in a simplified manner, compared to the original carpet designs. The artists may sometimes have painted the animals out of their imagination, but the general appearance of the painted rugs still resembles the originals. A general compositional analysis of the animal-style rugs from Renaissance paintings was first developed by Kurt Erdmann. The field of animal carpets is usually divided into rectangular compartments, large or small. Each compartment contains an octagon, which in turn contains animal figures of four types: # \\"Heraldic\\" animals, including single- or double-headed eagles; # A pair of birds and a tree; # Single birds or quadrupeds in a geometric frame; # Paired animals within a frame, sometimes depicted in combat. = 14th century = At the beginning of the 14th century, carpets with stylized single- or double-headed eagles appear. These are frequently seen in paintings of the Siena and Florence school. During the second half of the 14th century, stylized birds opposing a tree appear in Lippo Memmi's Virgin Mary and Child, 1340‚Äì50, and in Sano di Pietro's Marriage of the Virgin, 1448-52. Yetkin has identified a similar rug in the Vakƒ±flar Halƒ± Museum, Istanbul (Yetkin 1981, plate 17). The field of this rug is arranged in the common style, with birds facing a tree, but the birds are crested, and their design is more elaborate. The corners of the composition are filled with animal motifs, perhaps dragons. An animal-style rug with this more developed design appears on a painting by William Larkin (Yetkin, 1981, p. 28). A carpet fragment with a single bird with its head turned is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A painted counterpart can be seen in Niccol√≤ di Buonaccorso's \\"Marriage of the Virgin\\", 1380.

Marriage of the Virgin.1380. London NG.jpgNiccol√≤ di Buonaccorso, Marriage of the Virgin, 1380. National Gallery, London = 15th ‚Äì 16th century = By the beginning of the 15th century, the variations of the animal design increase: Two animal-style carpet fragments from Fustat were dated to the 15th century. They contain parts of a different version of the tree-and-birds pattern seen in the Marby rug. The field is no longer divided into fields, and the tree-and-paired birds pattern appear in offset rows, covering the field in endless repeat (Yetkin, 1981, p. 29, plates 18,19). A fresco in the Palais des Papes at Avignon, by Matteo di Giovanni depicts a carpet with rather indistinct bird figures in front of the Pope's throne. Written sources of the 14th century indicate that Pope Benedict XII very much liked a carpet with \\"white swans\\", which he had set before his throne. A painting by Giovanni di Paolo, 1440, shows an Anatolian animal style rug with birds spread before the pope's throne (Yetkin, 1981, p. 33, ill. 5 and 6). Various examples are known of paintings with single birds in rows without the rectangular field partition. A rug in the Konya Archaeological Museum, dated to the 15th century, represents an original from this group (Yetkin, 1981, p. 31, plate 20). A painting by Jaume Huguet in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya contains a nearly identical rug. Similar rugs can be seen in a painting by Giovanni di Paolo in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome, and in \\"Madonna enthroned\\" by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (Yetkin, 1981, p. 34, ill. 7 and 8). Another animal-type carpet of different design appears in Carlo Crivelli's \\"Annunciation\\", 1482. The design of this rug consists of stylized animal figures arranged between eight-pointed stars. A paired animal rug can be seen on Fra Angelico's San Marco Altarpiece. The Pergamon Museum's \\"Phoenix and Dragon\\" finds its painted counterparts in Domenico di Bartolo's \\"The Marriage of the Foundlings\\" (1440) shows a very similar rug, as well as Alesso Baldovinetti's \\"Tale of Saint Vincenzo Ferrerio\\", and Jacopo Bellini's \\"Annunciation\\". The Vakƒ±flar Museum's animal carpet has a painted counterpart in William Larkin's \\"Portrait of Dorothy Cary, later Viscountess Rochford\\". The animals shown in the painted rug are very similar to the small bird-like animals in the Vakƒ±flar carpet. As known so far, the carpet depicted in Larkin's portrait is the last of its kind, and the last animal carpet seen in a Western European painting (Balpƒ±nar, 1988, p. 62, Yetkin, 1981, p. 36). The Bat√°ri-Crivelli fragment finds its parallel in two paintings by Carlo Crivelli, the Annunciation of 1482 in the St√§del museum in Frankfurt and the Annunciation, with Saint Emidius in the National Gallery (1486). Both paintings depict a carpet with a sixteen-pointed star motif, with some compartments containing highly stylised animal motifs.

She edited the largest Japanese-American daily newspaper, The Rafu Shimpo for several years. She is currently a writer of both fiction and non-fiction works and the Edgar Award-winning Mas Arai mystery series. Biography Naomi Hirahara was born in 1962 in Pasadena, California to Japanese parents, both of whom were survivors of the Hiroshima bombing. She began writing when she was in elementary school in Altadena, California. She received her bachelor's degree from Stanford University in international relations with a focus on Africa and spent a summer during her studies volunteering with the YWCA in Ghana, West Africa. After her 1983 graduation, she furthered her education at the Inter- University Center for Japanese Language Studies in Tokyo. After a brief job as an editorial assistant, Hirahara began working at the Rafu Shimpo newspaper in 1984 as writer about the city of Los Angeles. Three years later, she began working at a boutique public relations firm to allow more time for creative writing and taking classes at the UCLA extension. After three years, she was asked to come back as an editor at the Rafu Shimpo and began writing nonfiction books in the 1990s. In 1996, Hirahara quit her job, took a fellowship for creative writing with the Milton Center at Newman University in Wichita, Kansas and committed to working full-time as a creative writer. In 2001, she published a non-fiction work, Green Makers: Japanese American Gardeners in Southern California and later that year published An American Son: The Story of George Aratani, Founder of Mikasa and Kenwood. In 2002, Distinguished Asian American Business Leaders was released. She sold her first fiction book, Summer of the Big Bachi in 2003, which received positive reviews in the Chicago Tribune, and later that same year was named by them as one of the \\"10 best mysteries and thrillers of 2004\\". It was also selected by Publishers Weekly as a \\"Best Books of 2004\\". The book turned out to be the first of a series about a Japanese-American gardener, Mas Arai, a survivor of the atomic bomb, but the character was American-born. Though he has a degree, prejudice keeps him from other work, and he becomes a gardener, mirroring Hirahara's father's experience. Mas Arai became the featured character in Gasa Gasa Girl, Snakeskin Shamishen, Blood Hina and Strawberry Yellow. (Strawberry Yellow takes place in Watsonville, Ca and at the Redman Hirahara Farmstead.) In 2007, the third book in her series, Snakeskin Shamishen won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America. The following year, the series began being released in Japan. In 2014, Hirahara began a new series, though Mas Arai's story has at least two more chapters. The new series features a young bicycle policewoman, Ellie Rush, who is the central character in Hirahara's seventh novel, Murder on Bamboo Lane. While the Arai series focuses on California centered around the World War II generation, the Rush series is contemporary and expands on Hirahara's desire to speak from a woman's point of view. Her first book in which the main character was a woman was a juvenile fiction work, 1001 Cranes, published in 2008. Her most recent book in the Ellie Rush series, Grave on Grand Avenue (2015) has received positive reviews, and has been featured as a \\"Best Book\\" by Publishers Weekly.

It has a thin, elongate body with a terminal mouth. Its coloration pattern varies depending on the maturity stages. As a juvenile and a female, the zigzag wrasse has a pearly white background coloration with a black or yellow or also black and yellow stripe zigzagging along the lateral line. As a mature male, the body coloration is very elaborated. The inferior side of the lateral line is pearly with pinkish reflection. The black or yellow line tend to disappear with age or it can be reduced to a short dash. The superior part is greenish with pink accents until the base of the dorsal fin. The base of the dorsal fin is highlighted by a bright yellow line. Then superimposed over this later yellow line a blue line, a yellow one, green one and finally a fin pinkish one. The iris of the eye is orange. Distribution & habitat The zigzag wrasse is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific, from the eastern coast of Africa, Red Sea included, to the Philippines and from New Caledonia to south Japan. The zigzag wrasse appreciates mixed areas of top reef (sand/rubble/corals) in shallow water down to 20 meters depth. Biology The zigzag wrasse can live in small groupAllen, G.R. and M.V.

Dimmick served in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. Career Dimmick was a graduate of Berea College and held Masters and Doctoral degrees from Yale Divinity School. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1955, and his first cure was St. Philip's, Nashville, Tennessee, where he was priest-in-charge from 1955-60. From there he went to St. Mary's Cathedral, Memphis, first as canon and later as dean. During most of his tenure as dean, he also served as deputy to the General Convention. Also as dean, he was a member of the Tennessee Board of Examining Chaplains. From 1973 until his election to the episcopate, Dimmick was rector of Trinity Church, Southport, Connecticut. He was also a member of the Episcopal Church's Standing Liturgical Commission from 1973 until his death. Consecrated as Bishop of Northern Michigan in May 1975, Dimmick resigned that post in 1982.

The site encompasses a shell midden, in which are embedded the remains of semi-subterranean pit-house structures. It is one of the best- preserved examples of this type in northeastern North America. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description Islesboro is an island community in Penobscot Bay, a deep indentation on the coast of Maine that bisects its coastline. On one of its east-facing coastlines stands a large shell midden that was surveyed by archaeologists from the Maine State Museum and partially excavated in 1980. The midden's surface exhibited a series of crater-like depressions, which were hypothesized before excavation to correspond to house pits. They were organized in two rows of three, running parallel to the coastline and varied in diameter between .Spiess, Arthur (1981). NRHP nomination for Archeological Site No. 29-64; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service In the 1980 excavation a trench long was dug through several of these features, and confirmed the assessment. Each feature had about of sterile soil laid on top of a habitation layer containing fire-cracked rock, charcol, pottery fragments, stone tools, and evidence of stone tool manufacture (debitage). These circular areas were surrounded by banks of clamshells that had slumped over time. Trenches through the shell deposits led away from these features, with additional refuse-type finds deposited to either side. The stone and ceramic finds are consistent with finds elsewhere in the region dated to about 500 CE. These house pits are remarkably well-preserved, having avoided erosion and vandalism, which affect many sites in the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada that have similar features. Because these types of houses were not in use by Native American communities by the time of European contact, these types of sites form an important window into the area's prehistory.

First Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe Announced in 1906, the first Deutsch de la Meurthe competition was a speed trial intended for all powered aircraft over a distance of 200 kilometres, to be flown as an outward leg of 100 km followed by a return to the starting point.Bulletin Officiel de l'Aƒóro-Club de France l'Aƒórophile, March 1906, p.71 The flight had to be made between 1 March and 31 October, and the performance was recognized only if the previous best performance was surpassed by at least 10%. A bonus of 20,000 francs was awarded each year for the best performance that had remained unsurpassed for eight months. The Coupe (cup), an objet d'art valued at 10,000 francs, was to be given to the first aircraft builder who won three consecutive competitions. =1912 competition= Despite the substantial prize being offered, it took six years to attract participants. On 12 April 1912, Maurice Tabuteau piloting a 50 hp Gnome-powered Morane-Saulnier monoplane flew the circuit in 1 h 47 min 48 s, despite persistent navigation problems caused by fog. On 1 May 1912 Parisian Emmanuel H√©len completed the course at flying a 70 hp Gnome-powered Nieuport monoplane. Since no other pilot bettered this performance by more than 10% before 31 October 1912, H√©len became the first holder of the Coupe.Flight, 5 May 1921, p. 317 =1913 competition= On 27 October 1913 Eug√®ne Gilbert gained first place in the second competition for the Coupe, covering the course at an average speed of in a 160 h.p. Gnome- powered Deperdussin Monocoque. =1919/1920 competition= Nieuport-Delage NiD.29V racer The competition was interrupted by the First World War, but on 13 October 1919 it resumed using the same course, but the competition was now open for the entire year, and the trophy would be definitely kept by the first participant whose time remained unbeaten for eight consecutive months.Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe Flight 23 October 1919 Four aeroplanes participated in this trial: a 180 hp Hispano-Suiza-powered Gourdou-Leseurre monoplane piloted by Rost, a 300 hp Hispano-Suiza-powered SPAD-Herbemont piloted by Joseph Sadi- Lecointe, a 300 hp Hispano-Suiza-powered Nieuport biplane piloted by Bernard Barny de Romanet, and a 180 hp Le Rh√∂ne-powered Nieuport monoplane designed by engineer Mary, and flown by the Danish pilot Leth Jensen. Taking off on 13 October 1919, Jensen flew the circuit at an average speed of 200.001 km/h (57 minutes). The next day, Rost reached an average speed of 210 km/h while de Romanet had an aircraft failure. On 15 October, Sadi-Lecointe flew a first circuit at 223 km/h, and then a second lap at 246.9 km/h and thus became the title holder. On 21 October 1919, de Romanet reached an average speed of 268.631 km/h which was insufficient to be homologated, because this performance was less than 110% of Sadi-Lecointe's performance. He followed it the next day with an average speed of 285.600 km/h which did count.\\"The Coupe Deutsch\\" Flight 30 October 1919 p1422 Bad weather then stopped the competition, which was resumed just three months later. On 3 January 1920, Sadi-Lecointe, who had in the meanwhile had left Bl√©riot-SPAD for Nieuport, reached \\"The Deutsch Cup Contest\\" Flight 8 January 1920 p56 with a Hispano- engined Nieuport-Delage NiD 29V. On 3 August 1920, he became the holder of the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe, his performance having remained unbeaten. Second Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe In 1920, following the ending of the Gordon Bennett Trophy competition due to a third consecutive French victory, the A√©ro-Club de France decided to organize a new competition to replace it. This was named Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe to honour Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe, who had died on 24 November 1919; the competition was funded by his family. It remained a speed competition, but was now to be held on a given date. The competition was to be held as 3 laps of a 100 km (62 mi) circuit, with its start at √âtampes and a turn made at la Marmogne farm at Gidy. The competition was open for three years and was international, with each country allowed three entrants. A sum of 60,000 francs was to be awarded each year for the best performance, and a cup valued at 20,000 francs given to the winner. In the case of the cup being won outright before the end of the competition, the winner would also received the remaining prize money =1921 competition= Nieuport NiD.41 Sesquiplan There were seven participants in this race, which was held on 1 October. No eliminating heats were needed to select from the five French pilot entrants, since Count Bernard de Romanet died when the wing fabric of his Lumi√®re-De Monge monoplaneThe aircraft could be configured as either a biplane or a monoplane. detached at high speed during the elimination trials on 23 September, and at the last moment Hanriot withdrew their entrant, the Hanriot HD.22. This was a metal monoplane with retractable landing gear expressly built for the race, and which had been intended to be piloted by Rost. Nieuport entered two Nieuport NiD.29Vs piloted by Sadi-Lecointe and Ferdinand Lasne, and a NiD.41 Sesquiplan was entrusted to Georges Kirsch. A 700 hp Fiat-powered Fiat biplane piloted by Francesco Brack Papa represented Italy, and British pilot Herbert James flew a 450 hp Napier Lion-powered Gloster Mars I (G-EAXZ).The Coupe de Deutsch de la Meurthe Flight, 29 September 1921, pp. 650-651]Lewis 1971, pp. 119-120 A broken propeller forced Sadi-Lecointe to make a forced landing in a beet field at Cernonville, injuring an eye and both legs in the process. The wing fabric of James' aeroplane was torn away, and he had to make a forced landing. Brach Papa established a new Italian speed record, but the engine exploded before the finish. Thus, only two Nieuport pilots were left to finish the race, Georges Kirsch winning with a speed of 282.75 km/h (a new world speed record for a distance of 300 km); Fernand Lasne's speed was 259.03 km/h. =1922 competition= The 1921 circuit remained unchanged for the 1922 competition, which was held on 30 September. Nieuport-AstraNieuport having taken over the Soci√©t√© Astra by this point entered a Nieuport NiD.29V piloted by Lasne and the sesquiplane piloted by Sadi-Lecointe, Jean Casale was piloting a Bl√©riot- SPAD S.58, a design based on the S.41 fighter. Fiat and Gloster were presenting the same machines and pilots as the preceding year. Assigned to their factory pilot Berthelin, who was new to this competition, the NiD.41 was retired at the last moment. The tailless Simplex aircraft which was supposed to be piloted by Georges Madon had an accident during its tests, and Charles Nungesser was absent.Lewis 1971, p. 129 In his Nieuport sesquiplane named Eug√®ne Gilbert (race number 5), Sadi-Lecointe covered the first 100 km at an average speed of 325 km/h (a new closed circuit speed record), but a spark plug popped out of its cylinder and passed through the engine cowling as he was turning around the airport pylon. The pilot was therefore forced to land, and the airplane hit a gutter which turned the aircraft on its back without injuring the pilot. James lost his maps during his flight and unable to find the turning point returned to the start. Jean Casale's SPAD S.58 Louis Bl√©riot (race no.3) was victim of a radiator leak, and made a forced landing at √âtampes and was unable to finish the race, as was also the case for Brack- Papa's Fiat R.700 which had a fuel pump failure. The first lap made by the Italian pilot at 288 km/h (179 mph) was not homologated since the aircraft had flown behind the time-keepers at the starting point, but he was offered a second attempt. Brack-Papa started a second time but retired when he realized he would not be able to beat Lasne, ) who won the competition with an average speed of 289.90 km/h. Third Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe In 1931 Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe initiated a new competition for the Coupe, which was contested for the first time on 29 May 1933. The trial was to be run in two 1,000 km stages separated by a 90 minutes refuelling stop, and was limited to aircraft with an engine capacity of less than eight litres. The starting point of the race was still at √âtampes. Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe was offering one million Francs, and the Minist√®re de l'Air (Air Ministry) offered another three million.Flight, 6 May 1932, p. 390 =1933 competition= A Potez 53 On 24 May 1933 Captain Ludovic Arrachart was killed when his Caudron C.360 (race no.11) crashed due to engine failure at Maisons near Chartres while he was training for the competition. The event was won by Georges D√©tr√© flying a Potez 53 powered by a Potez 9B radial engine developing barely 310 hp at full power at a speed of , beating Raymond Delmotte's Caudron C.362 (race no.6) with a speed of , and also beating the only foreign competitor, Nick Comper flying Comper Swift G-ABWW .Lewis 1971, p.251 A third French competitor, test pilot Lemoine also flying a Potez 53, was forced to abandon the race.Flight, 24 May 1934, pp. 510-511 =1934 competition= A Caudron C.460 replica Gloster Mars I (G-EAXZ) On 27 May 1934, the race was a duel between the Caudron pilots, the Caudron firm presenting two racing aircraft designed by Marcel Riffard. Maurice Arnoux won with a C.450 at a speed of 388.97 km/h overtaking Louis Massotte's Regnier-engined (and sponsored) C.366 (360.72 km/h) and Albert Monville's Renault-engined Caudron C.460 (341.04 km/h). Nick Comper flew the Comper Streak (G-ACNC), but retired on the 6th lap of the afternoon session as problem with the undercarriage limited his speed. Georges Detre flying a Potez 53-2 retired after problems with his engine oil supply. The Potez 53-3 had problems with its variable pitch propeller and was unable to start for the second section,Lewis 1971, p. 259Flight, 9 Nov 1933, p. 976Flight, 17 May 1934, pp. 476, 480-481Flight, 31 May 1934, pp. 531-532 =1935 competition= The 1935 race was arguably the most exciting competition of them all, and was the consecration of the Caudron-Renault racers. Eight pilots were registered for this event, but the Nennig C-3 (race no.4) of Guy Bart was not ready, and the R√©gnier Martinet, a modified Caudron C.366, (race no.2) was damaged during its tests. Two Caudron C.560s were supposed to participate (race no.1 and 3), but were not ready. They were thus replaced by a Caudron C.430 and a C.450 with the same race numbers.\\"A Family Affair\\" Flight, 30 May 1935, p. 600 The course was over 100 km (62 miles), from Etampes aerodrome to Chartres Bonce and back. The race itself was in two stages, each of 1,000 km (625 miles). Charles Franco was the first to take off in Caudron C.430 (race no.1), but abandoned the race on the fourth lap as he was clearly out-classed by the other aircraft. It was followed by the Caudron C.460s of Yves Lacombe (race no.5), Raymond Delmotte (Caudron's chief pilot) (race no.8 ), and Maurice Arnoux (race no.6) respectively, this last entrant having to quit the race after seven laps, having run out of oil after a high- speed lap at . Albert Monville's Caudron C.450 (race no.3) was the last to take off. Only three aircraft qualified for the second part of the race, which was held during rain showers. Raymond Delmotte won, ahead of Yves Lacombe and Maurice Arnoux, flying the aircraft previously flown by Albert Monville . Fourth Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe On 13 September 1936, a last competition was organized, in which two Caudron C.461s, one Caudron C.450 and two Caudron C.560s took part. Yves Lacombe won this race with a speed of only , overtaking Maurice Arnoux timed at , a performance barely superior to what had been established in 1934, probably because of bad engine tuning in a competition presenting no real challenge for the engine and aircraft manufacturers.Flight, 15 October 1936, p. 387 Footnotes See also * List of aviation awards Notes References *Foxworth, Thomas G. 1976.

Almost unknown in the west, his work was popular in East Germany, notably for his reductionist observational drawings of everyday life. Life Arno Mohr was born in Posen which at that time was in Germany. His father is variously described as \\"an officer\\" and as a \\"military musician\\". Between 1924 and 1927 Mohr undertook an apprenticeship as a sign painter with a firm in the city called Ladewig & Co and embarked on a life as a journeyman artist. In 1929/30 he was attending evening classes at the Arts and Crafts College. By 1930, with his parents, he had relocated to Berlin. Eventually, in 1933/34 he started a course of study at the Unified National Academy for Visual and Applied Arts in Berlin-Charlottenburg, hoping to use the opportunity to find his own \\"artistic signature\\". Here he was taught anatomy drawing by Wilhelm Tank with whom he would later form an artistically based friendship. Nevertheless, he only stayed for two terms, later explaining that in the aftermath of the Nazi take-over, he found the academy \\"too loud\\" (\\"zu laut\\"). Several years of casual employment followed. In the late summer of 1939. war resumed and Mohr joined the army. He survived, and by now in his mid 30s returned to Berlin in 1946. For the May 1946 Labour Day celebrations he got hold of a large piece of board that had been intended to seal broken window frames and drew on it a face with exaggerated features, accompanied by a casually discarded carnation. The resulting poster caught the mood of the moment and became, without any drama, his entry ticket for a career as an artist in the Soviet occupation zone (after October 1949 the German Democratic Republic). In 1946 Mohr was appointed professor at the Fine and Applied Arts Academy at Berlin-Weissensee. The position was one he retained for a remarkable 29 years, till 1974. As an artist Mohr never adopted the style of socialist realism favoured by the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED): his work always retained a certain apolitical humanity. Delight in the joy and humour to be found in scenes from everyday life, along with his involvement with craft-based human- scale artistry, did nothing to compromise Mohr's basic commitment to the socialist principals espoused by the East German political class, however. At this time he got to know Otto Dix as well as the artist and printer Alfred Erhardt. This led to the establishment of a printing workshop at the Weisseensee Academy, with Arno Mohr in charge of it. It also led him subsequently to set up his own printing workshop in Berlin-Lichtenberg. Works and exhibitions Between 1950 and 1990 Arno Mohr's work featured in numerous solo and joint exhibitions, both within the German Democratic Republic and abroad. His portraits of Bertolt Brecht and Helene Weigel are particularly well known, as is his 1989 landscape \\" Blick zum Bode-Museum\\". In 2000 a particularly high-profile exhibition of his work took place at the Academy of Arts in Berlin.

Built in 1871‚Äì72, it is a late work of the noted Portland architect George M. Harding, and one of the city's finest Victorian public buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and now houses apartments. Description and history The Old Saco High School stands on the northwest side of Spring Street, on a parcel that extends between Dyer and Bradley Streets, north of Saco's central business district. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, basically rectangular in shape, with a side-facing slate gabled roof that has brackets and dentil moulding at the eave. Its main facade, facing Spring Street, is symmetrical, with a central pavilion that rises to a concave mansard roof. The main entrance is set in the base of this pavilion, in a tall round-arch opening articulated by rustic granite quoining. First floor windows have round-arch tops with keystoned round-arch lintels; second floor windows hae segmented-arch tops. The school was built in 1871‚Äì72, and was designed by Portland architect George M. Harding, a leading regional architect of the period.

The firm has roots dating to 1828 and is the third largest insurance broker in the world. On 9 March 2020, Aon announced its acquisition of the companyhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/aon-to-merge-with-willis-towers-watson-in- all-stock-deal-valued-at-30-billion-11583758247 for nearly $30 billion in an all-stock deal that creates the world‚Äôs largest insurance broker.  Overview  Willis Towers Watson operates in more than 140 countries and has a workforce of more than 45,000 employees. It has joined the Hedge Fund Standards Board and follows the voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.  History  Willis Towers Watson was formed as a merger of equals between London based Willis Group Holdings plc and Arlington, VA based Towers Watson & Co. = Merger process = The merging companies announced the merger on 30 June 2015 in a deal valued at $18 billion. Willis Towers Watson would maintain its domicile in Ireland and list on the New York Stock Exchange. Later in 2015 the company moved its domicile to Virginia in the US and delisted from The NYSE and relisted on The NASDAQ. Willis Group exercised its right to acquire the remainder of Gras Savoye and agreed to purchase 85% of Miller, the leading London independent wholesale insurance broker.  Criticism  Critics to the deal pointed out that the original offer would not be beneficial to Towers Watson shareholders as they would receive package of shares and a special cash dividend that is valued at $125.13 per share. This value was 9.3% lower than the trading price of Towers Watson's stock was at the time of the announcement of the deal. The revised offer in November increased the value to $130.26 per share, which was still lower than the trading price of Towers Watson shares at the time of the announcement. The deal also gives Willis Group shareholders more control despite the firm having a lower market capitalization compared to Towers Watson. In an open letter, investment adviser Driehaus Capital Management urged Towers Watson shareholders to vote against a proposed merger. Driehaus argued that Towers Watson was worth between 39% and 53% more as a standalone company than by merging with Willis Group. It was also reported that Towers Watson CEO John Haley had disposed of his shares in the company in early March 2015 while the merger negotiations were ongoing. On 18 November 2015, the board of Towers Watson failed to get enough investor support for the deal, with only 40% of shareholders voting in favor of the proposed merger with Willis Group. This rejection led to Willis Group increasing its special cash dividend for Towers Watson shareholders to USD $10 per share. This revised offer was approved by Towers Watson shareholders on 11 December 2015. = Completion = The merger was closed on 5 January 2016 once all regulatory approvals were received. Willis Towers Watson publicly announced their name change on 5 January. Willis Group shareholders owned 50.1% while those of Towers Watson shareholders owned 49.9% of the combined company. On completion, Towers Watson CEO, John Haley, became the CEO, Willis Group CEO, Dominic Casserley, became the President and Deputy CEO while Willis Group Chairman, James McCann, became the chairman of the merged group with the twelve board seats shared equally between the two companies. For the first fiscal quarter of 2016, the first earnings release since the merger completed, Willis Towers Watson reported that merger and acquisition costs remain significant and are likely to total between $150 million and $175 million. Three years after the merger, the company reported that cost-saving synergies have exceeded expectations, reaching $175 million versus previous estimates of $100-$125mn.

AAT is a technician level qualification offering higher apprenticeships which entitles those who have completed the exams and obtained relevant supervised work experience to become an accountant.  History  The need for accounting technicians were emphasized in the master plan for Accountancy Education in Sri Lanka prepared by the Asian Development Bank Inception Mission in 1986 and following that AATSL was established in December 1987 on the model of the Association of Accounting Technicians (UK) and subsequently AAT Ireland (called Institute of Accounting Technicians Ireland) was formed in April 1983.  Professional recognition  AAT Sri Lanka is registered under the Companies Act No 17 of 1982 and re-registered under the Companies Act No 7 of 2007, as a company limited by guarantee. Two years after its inception, the institute was admitted to the associate membership of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) which is a key body for accountants. AAT Sri Lanka also has the distinction of being the first associate member of the Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA), a leading network of accounting bodies in the region.  Governing council  AATSL is governed by a governing council which has the primary responsibility of presiding over the AATSL's affairs and provide efficient governance for the benefit of all stakeholders.

It was the home ground of Cowlairs F.C. during their time in the Scottish Football League. History The ground was opened in 1890 when Cowlairs moved from Gourlay Park prior to the start of the first Scottish Football League season.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p221, It was located on Cowlairs Road to the east of the Cowlairs railway works. The first league game at the stadium was played on 23 August 1890, with Cowlairs beating Vale of Leven 3‚Äì2. The highest league attendance at the ground was probably the 2,500 who watched Cowlairs lose 5‚Äì0 to Celtic on 29 April 1891, with the likely record attendance being 6,000 for a Glasgow Cup semi-final game against Celtic on 27 October 1894. By then the stadium had an open seated stand on the northern side of the pitch, a pavilion complex in the south-eastern corner, and a running track that was added in 1893. At the end of the 1894‚Äì95 season Cowlairs failed to be re- elected to the Scottish League. After leaving the league, they returned to Goulay Park. The league match at Springvale Park was played on 27 April 1895, with Cowlairs beating Dundee Wanderers 2‚Äì1. The site was later used to expand the surrounding railway sidings and for a railway chord allowing direct services between Glasgow Queen Street and Springburn.

Other NGOs in the District include World Vision International, Save the Children, and the Family Planning Association of Malawi. Leadership The District Health Management Team (DHMT) is led by a district health officer who reports to the District Executive Committee locally as well as to the Central Ministry of Health through a Zonal Supervisor. Leadership role has many other responsibilities like to look after work related concerns to documentations with respect to each department. Service organization Village Health Committees, Village Health Workers, and Health Surveillance Assistants provide community-based services while Health Centers are the main primary care facilities. A referral system links patients from the lower to the upper tiers. Both the community hospital and the district hospital also offer primary care services for their immediate catchment populations in addition to serving as local referral facilities.

It bears several buildings registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. Location Street stretches along the Brda river from the intersection with Bernardy≈Ñska street to Theatre square. On its way, the following streets intersect it from the north: * Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki street; * Pocztowa street. Kasernenstrasse 1899 View from the river to the west The renovated walkway following the Brda river has been given in 2009 the name of Boulevard Zbigniew Urban ( \\"Bulwar Zbigniewa Urbanyiego\\"). History The street was founded with as the trail along the old road leading to the old harbour. The road already existed in the Old Polish period (before the 16th century). The river banks were used for storing stored goods and timber rafting. Earliest written mention of the street can be found on a detailed plan drawn by the Prussian geometer Gretha in 1774, where is noticed a row of granaries along its path. In the late 18th century, was built at the place of today's Main Post Office a complex of barracks for the Prussian garrison: hence the name \\"Kasernenstrasse\\". On a city map from 1809 appears a complex of buildings in the northern part of the street, with some gardens and farm fields towards Grodztwo. In the middle of the 19th century, newly built granaries and few other buildings were standing in the street. More buildings appeared in the end of this century: * The main Post office building complex (1883-1885); * Tenements in the corner with Theatre Square (1894). In addition, a wide wharf was used for loading and unloading goods from barges plying on the waterways between Vistula and Oder. The street frontage did not evolve much through the beginning of 20th century and World War II. In 1976-1978 and 1986-1987, Brda river waterfront has been renovated and upgraded, setting up a walkway and recreation areas. In 1989, in front of N¬∞9, has been unveiled a sculpture, \\"The three Graces ( Trzy Gracje ). This work, realized by Jerzy Buczkowski, displays a bronze casting of three women, the Graces, who, according to Greek mythology were goddesses of charm, beauty, nature, human creativity, and fertility. The \\"Three Graces\\" are considered one of the most successful examples of modern sculpture in Bydgoszcz.

Originally, it was planned to house a Department store and an apartment. The building was completed in 1894. In 1910, the northern end was razed to build a more modern Department store designed by Fritz Weidner. In the 1930s, gables were demolished and decoration moved on the top of the cornice, getting rid of statuesque decorations. In 2011, a thorough refurbishing has been performed on the facade, exposing its initial splendor. Building elevations display on both sides a lavish Neo-Baroque d√©cor, trademark of J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki. They recall his famous realization on Gdanska street. Architectural features include, among others: * Bay-windows stretching on several levels and topped by terraces, flanked by columns; * Wrought iron balconies; * Prolific decoration elements, including a Hermes staff above a balcony.

After the Restoration he served as an officer in the English Army, and was a Member of Parliament for Chester during most of the 1670s and 1680s. Biography Werden was the son of John Werden of Chester (died 1646), and his wife Katherine, daughter of Edward Dutton, Governor of Barbados. He had at least one sister, Katherine (died 1683), who married Carey Dillon, 5th Earl of Roscommon and had issue. On the eve of the English Civil War John Werden was appointed a commissioner of array for Cheshire. He exerted his influence in support of the royal cause, and his son Robert was named colonel of a troop of horse under Sir John Byron, 1st Baron Byron. Robert distinguished himself by his activity. He took part in the defence of Chester, but was wounded and taken prisoner in a skirmish on 18 January 1645. His father assisted in the negotiations for the surrender of the town, and signed the articles of surrender on 3 February 1646. On 26 March John Werden begged to be permitted to compound for his delinquency in being a commissioner of array, pleading that he had never acted against Parliament, and that he had been active in the surrender of Chester. The commissioners for compounding were moved by his representations, and, although he had not come in within the prescribed term, they only imposed on him the small fine of ¬£600, \\"consideration being had of his great losses and kind offices to members of parliament\\". Their sentence was confirmed by the House of Commons of England on 9 July, Robert being included in the composition. On 21 July the county committee indignantly remonstrated, declaring Robert was \\"a most violent enemy, administering general astonishment and terror to the whole country\\". They were, however, too late; the house declined to recede from its former decision, and as John Werden had died about the close of 1646, Robert Werden was finally cleared by a draft ordinance of the House of Lords on 12 February 1647. cites Journals of the House of Commons, iv. 611, 721; Journals of the House of Lords, ix. 5, 7. In 1648, Werden's estates were again sequestered on the suspicion that he harboured treasonable designs, a fifth being allowed his wife for maintenance. On 27 January 1652 they were discharged from sequestration, but in 1655 his fidelity was seen to be very doubtful, cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1655, pp. 216, 220. and in 1659 he took part in the Royalist rising under Sir George Booth. He was proclaimed a traitor and a rebel on 9 August, cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1659‚Äì60, p. 94. and his goods sequestered on 27 August. A few days earlier he was captured and sent to London for examination. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1659‚Äì60, pp. 154, 157, 160, 333. He succeeded in making his peace with the Commonwealth, probably at the expense of the Royalists. At the Restoration Werden was imprisoned on a charge of treason. Among other acts of treachery he was accused of endeavouring to secure the king's person after the Battle of Worcester (1651) and of betraying Booth in 1659. Booth and other Lancashire gentlemen, however, befriended him, and he finally obtained his pardon, received back his estates, and in 1662 was made a groom of the Duke of York's bedchamber, and was granted the lands of Thomas Wogan, the regicide, in Pembrokeshire. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1660‚Äì1 p. 9, 1661‚Äì2 pp. 218, 459, 566, 1663‚Äì4 p. 157; Hist. MSS. Comm. 5th Rep. App. p. 156, 8th Rep. App. i. 278, 280. On 4 June 1665 he received the commission of lieutenant in the Duke of York's guards, cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1664‚Äì5, pp. 407, 517. and in May 1667 he was named a commissioner for regulating the Duke of Norfolk's affairs. cites Pepys, Diary and Corresp. ed. Braybrooke, iv. 90. On 29 June 1667 he was appointed lieutenant and major in the Duke of York's guards, cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1667, p. 245. and on 2 October 1672 was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and lieutenant-colonel. On 10 February 1673 Werden was returned to parliament for Chester, retaining his seat until the dissolution in 1679. He was returned for the same city on 9 March 1684‚Äì1685 to the first parliament of James II. On 1 May 1678 he received the commission of brigadier of the horse, and in the summer served in Flanders expedition against the French. In 1679 he was appointed comptroller of the Duke of York's household. On the accession of James II he was promoted, on 19 June 1685, to the rank of \\"brigadier over all our forces\\", and on 31 July was appointed major-general. On 24 October he received the command of the regiment of horse now known as the 4th Dragoon Guards, and on 8 November 1688 attained the rank of lieutenant-general. On 15 September of that year, when the borough of Chester was remodelled by James, he was appointed a common councillor. cites Hist. MSS. Comm. 8th Rep. App. i. 361. Notwithstanding the many benefits he received from James, Werden deserted him during the Glorious Revolution in 1688, and was rewarded by the post of treasurer to Queen Mary II. He died on 23 January 1690. Family Werden was twice married: first, to Jane Backham; secondly, to Margaret Towse. With his first wife he had John Werden (1640‚Äì1716) who became a politician and a baronet; Robert, a captain in the Royal Navy, who was killed fighting against the Dutch at the Battle of Solebay on 28 May 1673, while in command of HMS Henrietta, cites Hist. MSS. Comm. 10th Rep. App. vi. 182. and Katherine, married to Richard Watts of Muchmunden in Hertfordshire.

Filmed entirely in the city of Leeds, this film portrays criminal youth culture in Britain at the turn of the 21st century. Plot The film begins with a view of the city skyline and we hear dance music bellowing amongst the chimney tops. The camera closes in on one of the many terraced houses to reveal a drug dealer (Lee) playing computer games with his friends and attempting to pass a cannabis joint to his pregnant girlfriend. Lee has just left prison for the second time and is now living in a council house courtesy of Leeds City Council. He lives there with his girlfriend Carol, who at the start of the film is pregnant with their unborn daughter Lily. When Carol miscarries her baby, she blames Lee and their lifestyle for the loss and leaves him. Lee seems unaffected and continues his lifestyle of dealing drugs, intimidating others and getting into fights. Lee is pushed the drugs by his mother, who seemingly cares little for him. She introduces him to a new drug called \\"wax\\" which begins to give him hallucinations of his dead child. He tries to ignore the hallucinations as a side effect of the drug, but they increasingly occupy his thoughts. Carol is now going out with a local hard man called Tommy, who traps her in an abusive relationship. Carol calls out to Lee for help and so Tommy challenges Lee but to no avail. Lee shuns Carol and does not fight Tommy, despite still having feelings for her. Lee is becoming increasingly confused about what is important to him and the repeated hallucinations of his baby become more vivid. Lee is arrested after a nightclub fight with a rival drug dealer, but is released without charge. When he goes to his mother's house he discovers that his mother has been supplying his rival and is also having a relationship with him. This pushes Lee over the edge and he turns to his hallucinations as the only reliable constant left in his life. Through visions of his baby he realises that his love for Carol is never going to leave him and he sets about getting her back. In a violent confrontation with Tommy at the end of the film, Lee finally challenges his own perceptions of life and the realities he has built around himself. The denouement of the film sees Lee and Carol reunited with an announcement that Carol is once again pregnant with Lee's child. Now a reformed character, Lee prepares to make a real attempt to maintain their relationship and be the best father he can be. The film ends with Lee walking into the distance to find work to provide for his family.

Reception Dream's Ashes premiered on the opening night of the 2005 Leeds International Film Festival and received recognition for its quality, despite being a low budget independent film. \\"Independent filmmaking does not get much better than this\\" - British Independent Film Awards 2006. \\"Accomplished performances in this exquisitely shot low-budget movie by excellent filmmakers\\" - Leeds International Film festival 2005. \\"Outstanding, welcome addition to the classics of British Film\\" - British Film Institute 2005. Controversy Dream's Ashes was originally intended to be broadcast as a television film, but was banned by both the BBC and Channel 4. It was considered to contain excessive obscene language which the director refused to re-edit, stating that it would betray the integrity of the writing and performances. Rafe Clayton (writer/director), said that the language use is authentic to the setting and its removal would degrade the genuine portrayal of the lives the film represents. Too short for cinema release, the film was illegally distributed under the names 'Chav' and 'Dealer' and reached popularity largely among teenage audiences. It has a small cult following particularly in France, Japan and the United States.

Background  The plan was to set off an explosive charge in the form of a conical tip placed below the runway when the C-130 was to be at full throttle during takeoff. Near the middle of the runway some 1,100 meters away from the northern end and 1,000 from the southern, a disused sewer led to a storm drain. A cable was laid through the 250-meter tunnel, emerging from the storm drain and connecting the charge to the 12V battery of a parked vehicle. The switch would be activated from a nearby pit. This \\"masterpiece of military engineering\\", referred to as such by Montoneros, had taken at least six months of planning; the fork of a branch was used as a benchmark to calculate the plane's trajectory.  The downing  TC-62 took off from El Palomar Air Base at 09:00, carrying 85 members of the Argentine Federal Police, and landed at the Benjamin Matienzo International Airport at 11:56. The plane immediately started refueling started and 114 members of the National Gendarmerie embarked on the way home for their leave. The trip to San Juan was to be the second leg of the four- flight day's schedule. Shortly after 13:00, the C-130 began taxiing and reached a speed of 200 km/h after traveling 800 meters. The explosion took place between 100 and 150 meters in front of the aircraft and two seconds away in time, leaving a 12-meter wide and 2-meter deep crater. The plane was between 12 and 15 meters above the ground at the time of the blast when it caught fire, leaned on its right side and crashed 400 meters further down the runway. Five gendarmes were killed and 29 wounded in the explosion and subsequent fire, including six of the seven crew members. However, one who was unhurt set out to rescue those who were still trapped. He died later from asphyxiation after repeatedly entering the burning aircraft.

The recognized complex consists of ten buildings on , about west of downtown Concord. Another 4.4 acres are not included. The oldest portion of the mill, now its eastern section, is a brick two-story structure 14 bays long and 9 deep. The historic site also includes some worker housing. The mill was built in 1898 by the Coleman Manufacturing Company, owned by Warren Clay Coleman, an African-American businessman of Concord, with a nine-man board made up of seven other African-American partners and one white. He needed more investment when nationwide subscriptions to purchase stock fell short. Washington Duke, a white tobacco magnate from Durham, contributed $1000, and made two $10,000 loans, which aided the company in constructing the mill and beginning operations. Coleman hired white contractors and African-American crews. Builder Adolphus Henry Propst and brick maker and mason Rufus A. Brown led these crews in the construction. At one point Coleman paid the workers in stock in the company, but they demanded cash to finish the project. Coleman announced that he would hire only African-American workers, and sparked a national discussion. The New York Times suggested that he might open the door for the hiring of more African Americans in the textile industry, where mill workers were generally restricted to whites. Some people worried that this would depress wages for whites, as blacks were paid less. Others were more worried about potential child labor laws under discussion. Coleman was under-capitalized and struggled financially in an economic depression, at a time when all mill owners faced rising prices of cotton. Coleman's death in 1904 further weakened his company. Benjamin Duke initially bought the mill because of outstanding debt. Later it was sold and used by other textile companies. Franklin Cotton Mills made changes and additions in 1912 that doubled it in size, adding on to the west side and removing the west 1898 wall to make interior passage unimpeded. Other alterations and additions were made through the 1960s, sometimes for structural reasons. In the late 20th century, the mill was owned by Fieldcrest-Cannon, the last textile company to own it. During this period, major textile companies moved their jobs offshore to get cheaper labor costs, and the textile industry in the South virtually disappeared. In the 21st century the mill was sold; it has been adapted as a production facility for moonshine. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

History The Southold Free Library is the third library organization to have served the town. It was preceded by the first (unnamed) library, and the Lyceum Library.The renovation that costed 1.75 million dollars on the over thousand year old building ended in 2020. =The first library= The incorporators of Southold's first library initially met on November 2, 1797 to set up a library for the purpose of \\"diffusing of useful knowledge and the improvement of the human mind.\\" Membership dues were set at $3. The certificate of incorporation (recorded at the Suffolk County Court House) is dated November 20, 1797. The board of trustees held their first meeting on December 1, 1797 where they codified rules and penalties for overdue and damaged books. (The incorporators lived not only in Southold but as far as Riverhead.) The initial location of the first library is not known. Apparently it led a peripatetic existence, at one point housed in the home of Captain John Yonges (for whom Youngs Avenue is named), at another point in the storefront of William H. Wells, and, in the mid-19th century, in the home of Slater Storrs Horton, postmaster and builder of the Presbyterian parsonage. By the 1860s the library had ceased to exist, while smaller libraries existed in churches and schools. =The Lyceum Library= The Southold Lyceum Association (an example of the then-prevalent Lyceum movement in the United States) made a second attempt at creating a library in the town. Organized on October 3, 1871, its purpose was \\"the improvement and entertainment of its members.\\" It began operations on May 11, 1872 in the home of Jonathan W. Huntting, with H. Howard Huntting as librarian. In addition to lending books, its activities included picnics, lectures, and other fundraising activities, tied in with its purpose of Southold Lyceum Association, of hosting staged plays. An early catalog indicated that annual subscriptions cost $1, and weekly rentals began at 5 cents. The catalog dated June 13, 1884 indicates the library containing 636 books. From 1884-1887 the library was located in a room at the rear of Henry Howell's Drug Store, Henry Howell functioning as librarian. In 1888, the Southold Reading Room Association was formed to house the library. Apparently the maintenance of the library was too burdensome and the Southold Lyceum Association met on May 7, 1896 to dissolve the library. The Association subsequently donated the books to the Southold Union School. A 1947 article noted that, at a time where few schools had their own libraries, \\"The Lyceum Library enriched the life of this community for more than twenty years and then helped to raise the status of the public school from a district to a union school.\\" The origins of the Southold Free Library date to 1904 when Lucy Hallock and Rev. William H. Murray (he of the Universalist Church) recognized the propitious time to organize a library. Years later, Hallock (who by then had married Albert A. Folk) related that at the time of the library's formation, Southold had numerous groups promoting education, cultural, entertainment, a lecture association, a dramatic club, church and school libraries, and a book club of about 40 members. Hallock would visit the eastern part of Long Island on her bicycle; together with Rev. Murray they would go door-to-door circulating petitions and seeking supporters for an annual membership fee would be $1. A public meeting of the Southold Free Library Association was held on June 25, 1904 at Belmont Hall where attendees voted to organize a library in accordance with state law, which stipulated a minimum $100 raised in annual membership fees and the creation of a constitution, to which the state would reciprocate with an additional $100. That constitution, adopted at the board meeting of July 9, 1904, stated the purpose of the library was \\"To maintain a circulating library and reading room free for public use to the inhabitants of Southold, Bay View, Peconic and Arshamomoque School Districts.\\" The second floor reading room of the Southold Free Library The first location of the Southold Free Library was in the parlor of the house belonging to Valentine Heubel (whose house also contained a barber shop). The library opened to the public on October 5, 1904 with Lucy Hallock as the first librarian. Records show that 66 books were borrowed that day. Hallock later described the parlor as a small room, containing four windows, and a door to the sidewalk. The library was open on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday afternoons for three hours each, and an extra two hours on Saturday evenings. In colder weather, the Heubels would keep a stove burning to provide warmth and serve coffee at the end of the day. By the first annual meeting, 500 books had been purchased with an additional 113 books acquired as gifts. In 1907 the Heubels enlarged the library space by breaking through a wall. By July 1909 the collection had grown from 613 to 2,600 books. Whereas circulation for the nine months ending June 30, 1905 had been 6,816, by 1909 it had grown to 15,489. The library began a children's hour that year in efforts to promote closer relationships with children. In 1912 the Library moved to its second location, the M. H. Hawkins Building on Beckwith Avenue. In 1915, W. H. Hawkings noted that a petition had been circulated in support of a $400 contribution to the library budget from the Southold School District. By 1920, the treasure could note that the school district contributed $400. In 1925, the Southold Savings Bank left their building at the corner of Youngs Avenue. Edna Cahoon Booth (wife of Clement Booth\\"East Hampton Free Library,\\" East Hampton Star (Dec. 21, 1928), p. 10.), whose family had been Southold residents since 1900, purchased the building that year and donated it to the library as a memorial to her parents, Edward Cahoon and Georgianna (born Rockwell) Cahoon. The Town of Southold contributed $1,104 to the library on February 20, 1928. The library opened in the Cahoon Memorial Building, its current quarters, on December 15, 1928. The Samuel and Beryl Epstein children's room in the Southold Free Library On July 15, 1954, fifty years after the founding of the library, the Friends of the Southold Free Library was organized to support the library through fundraising. Its purpose as stated in original documentation was \\"to inform the public concerning the available services, resources and needs of the Library and to help it achieve its maximum usefulness to the community.\\" From July 19‚Äì21, 1956, the Friends held their first book sale. As part of the celebration observing the Library's 50th anniversary, the trustees dedicated The Lucy Hallock Folk Room in honor of the Library's first librarian. In 1961, the Library became a charter member of the Suffolk Cooperative Library System, allowing for enhanced borrowing and services among the member libraries of Suffolk County. =The building= The building now housing the Southold Free Library was built in 1891 in Richardsonian Romanesque style and originally housed the Southold Savings Bank. It was designed by George H. Skidmore of Riverhead, designer of the Queen Anne/Shingle Style First Congregation Church (built in 1909), as well as the Riverhead Savings Bank Building (built in 1892), both in Riverhead, as well as many private residences on Eastern Long Island. His design for what is now the Library was described as a \\"compact one-story building with a parapet gable terminating in square brick posts...Decorative elements include iron window grates, granite coping and projecting brick headers on the upper half of the facade\\" making the structure, when first built, an \\"innovative addition to the Southold streetscape.\\" =Services= In addition to loaning typical library materials (books, e-books, CDs, DVDs), the Southold Free Library lends out fishing rods. It also provides space for the community to enjoy air- conditioning (appreciated by the community during a 2015 power outage), Wi-Fi, a charging station, coffee, a chance to try out iPads. The Library enjoys occasional use of a 3D printer which rotates residence among several Suffolk public libraries (a benefit of belonging to the Suffolk Cooperative Library System). Additionally the Library provides delivery for those who are home- bound, a book discussion group, technical assistance, classes, resume writing and job assistance, and a small gallery space. The Library functions as a community space with a wide variety of programming aimed at children of all ages as well as adults, including lectures, tours, community walks, discounts to museums and other places of interest, and classes in conversational English.Southold Free Library [Newsletter] (Sept.-Oct. 2015). Each issue of the bimonthly newsletter lists numerous activities for all ages. Several yards north of the Library, the Book Cottage functions as a community used bookstore with the funds raised going to the Library. The Southold Free Library's Book Cottage is where one can donate and purchase used books, funds going to the LIbrary =Whitaker Historical Collection= The Whitaker Historical Collection, the library's Special Collections, is named for Reverened Epher Whitaker (1820-1916) who came to Southold to become minister of the town's First [Presbyterian] Church at the age of 31 in 1851 and lived there until his death. Additionally he founded the Southold Academy (town's first high school) and was author of the book History of Southold, L.I.: Its First Century (New York: Printed for the author, 1881). In his honor, a group of residents founded the Whitaker Historical Collection in 1940 to be housed the library. This group initiated the collection with a variety of historical documents: books, diaries, genealogies, letters, business ledgers, a variety of manuscript documents, and photographs. Over the years others have contributed additional historical materials documenting the history of Southold and its residents. Among its holdings are the materials belonging to Epher Whitaker including the historical research he undertook for his publications on Southold history.Some of this material is cataloged in OCLC; see the Archivegrid entry in \\"External links.\\" =1991 renovation= Due to numerous instances of damage due to leaks, vandalism, an old furnace, and general deterioration of a building approaching its first century, Library trustees entertained the idea of renovation in 1979, recognizing that fundraising and completion of the task could take years. In 1986, after a changeover in library directors and appointment of new board members, the trustees appointed local architects Nancy L. Steelman and Thomas C. Samuels to propose renovations to the Library. With their associate Ural Taggart, the architects chose to create a three-story adjoining structure that would continue the building's original style but with fanciful touches. The plan was accepted by the trustees in 1987 and a kickoff fundraiser took place on July 28, 1988. Through far-sighted vision, the Library owned much of the adjacent land. Meanwhile, the building had to be repointed for the safety of patrons. Eventually, after much fundraising (including grants), and obtaining the appropriate zoning permits, the Tromel Construction Corporation of Bay Shore was awarded the contract; a groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 20, 1990. The dedication of the renovated library took place exactly 100 years after the building's opening on December 15, 1991. =2008 expansion proposal and defeat= Already in 2002 and 2006 the Library had purchased adjacent property, anticipating a time when the area could be used. By 2007, the library board had documented a dramatic increase in library circulation and use of library services which was taxing the building and staff (most of which had no offices).Southold Free Library Building Program Statement, accessed 3 Sept. 2015. In order to meet the community's needs, in 2008 the Library board proposed an expansion of the library building.Planning the Future, Southold Free Library accessed 3 Sept. 2015. The $7.25 million expansion would have added 7,700 square feet to the existing 9,000-square-foot building.Matthew Chayes, \\"Voters reject Southold Free Library expansion,\\" Newsday (Oct. 16, 2010), accessed 3 Sept. 2015. Although some of the funding would have come from development, property tax assessment would have cost taxpayers an extra $115‚Äì135 per year for twenty years.C.R. Kahme, \\"Apathy Could Cost You $7.25 Million,\\" North Fork Patch (Sept. 25, 2010) accessed 3 Sept. 2015. Possibly due to the continued effects of the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 the proposal was found unappealing and the library expansion plan was defeated in October 2010. Recognizing that a physical expansion would be unpopular while the economy is still in recovery, in 2015 the Board of Trustees agreed to reconfigure the existing structure in order to maximize space. Such efforts are ongoing.Maggie Merrill, \\"The Elephant in the Library,\\" Southold Free Library [Newsletter] (Sept.-Oct. 2015), p. 1. Commemorative plaque on the property of the Southold Free Library noting Thomas Jefferson's and James Madison's visit to Southold, June 12‚Äì13, 1791 =2018 renovation= On August 1, 2018, the Library closed for a year-long renovation. David Robinson, the president of the Board of Trustees, said \\"Our goal is to restore the historical splendor of the original library while at the same time updating the technology and the physical space.\\"Tara Smith, \\"Southold Library to begin yearlong renovation,\\" Suffolk Times (July 23, 2018). accessed July 24, 2018. Changes to the physical space include the creation on the second floor of a teen space and spaces for study, gaming that will foster greater socialization. The Whitaker Room (containing Special Collections and a rich source for local history) will move down to the first floor, providing greater community exposure. The renovation is being led by architect Vincent Benic who is a part-time Southold resident. The renovation is expected to cost $1.7 million; $1 million raised from previously donation, and $750,000 to be raised from temporary three-year tax increase that the town voted in favor of. During the renovation, library services will be served from Elmer‚Äôs Custom Amish Furniture. Library programming will be distributed throughout the community.

Although it is on the main chain, the Gro√üer Kellenberg does not form a prominent watershed in this area, because both the Glanebach, and the in- and outflows of the Gr√ºner See empty into the River Hunte after a few kilometres. This is because the Hunte breaks through the Wiehen Hills 2.5 kilometres west of the Gro√üer Kellenberg. The hill marks the end of the 3rd stage and start of the 4th stage of the Wittekindsweg, the ridgeway on the main hill chain. In addition, the 3-kilometre-long Gro√üer Kellenberg Circular Path (Rundweg Gro√üer Kellenberg) runs around the hill.Route description of the circular walk  Tumuli  There are several tumuli (H√ºgelgr√§ber) on the eastern and northern slopes of the hill and partly in the valley bottom of the Gr√ºner See.

Her father earned a position at a company in Manchuria before World War II, and the family lived there. When the war broke out, her father was drafted and died in the Philippines. Once the family made it back to Japan, Tsunoda's mother decided to move the family to Hawaii, where she was sure could make a living. Tsunoda easily adjusted to living in America, and became a citizen in 1952.

History  The 2nd Guards Airborne Division was formed from 7th Airborne Corps on 8 December 1942 in Zvenigorod. The division was fully equipped by January 1943 and concentrated in the area of Ostashkov. As a part of the 1st Shock Army, the division attacked the Demyansk Pocket on 26 February 1943. The division only advance 3 kilometers against the German forces and was replaced with the 250th Rifle Division after several days of heavy fighting. The division was transferred to the area of Slugin village. The division was now to take Lyahnovo village, which controlled a road out of the Demyansk Pocket. The 5th Guards Airborne Regiment crossed the Porus River and cut the road on 7 March. However, German counterattacks pushed the division out of Lyahnovo. The division was transferred to the rear afterwards. The division then transferred to the 18th Guards Rifle Corps in the area of Kursk. They took positions in the second defensive line of the 13th Army, part of the Central Front. From 5 July to 23 August, the 2nd Guards Airborne fought in the Battle of Kursk. Between 26 August and 30 September, the division, now part of the 60th Army participated in the capture of Pryluky during the Chernigov-Pripyat Operation. On 2 October, the 7th Guards Airborne Regiment crossed the Dnieper, capturing a bridgehead near the village of Medwin in the Chernobyl Raion. On 18 November, it went to the village of Rakovic.

Michael (1907‚Äì1992) was a German-born American scholar of China, whose teaching career was spent at University of Washington, Seattle, and at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Michael's research began with publications concerning the Manchus in China, the Qing dynasty and the Taiping Rebellion against it. He also studied Tibet and Inner Asia, and the tradition of authoritarian government in China, including the People's Republic of China. The themes of despotism, cultural synthesis or assimilation, and the modern fate of Confucian humanism shaped the choice of topics in Michaels' academic work and public advocacy, and his experience in 1930s Germany directly influenced his anti-totalitarian and anti-communist stance. The festschrift The Modern Chinese State (2000) was dedicated \\"In Memory of Professor Franz Michael: Scholar, Advocate, and Gentleman\\". It grew out of a memorial conference at The George Washington University organized by a group of Michael's colleagues and former students. Early life and academic career Franz Michael was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, where his father was a university professor. He enrolled in the Law Faculty of Friedrich-Wilhelm University in Berlin and in the Seminar for Oriental Languages there as well. He received a diploma in sinology in 1930, then transferred to the University of Freiburg and finished his degree there three years later. In 1934 Michael joined the diplomatic corps but was not allowed to serve abroad because his father's side of the family was Jewish. Instead, at the age of twenty-six he resigned and obtained passage on a ship for China, where he obtained a post teaching German language at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, he and his family joined the migration to inland China, but left in 1939 to go to the United States. Only as his six-month visa was about to expire did he find that he had been accepted as a Research Associate at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. In 1942, he set up a U.S. Army Asian-language training program at the University of Washington, Seattle, where he remained for twenty-two years. After the war, Michael and George E. Taylor organized the Modern Chinese History Project, an Area Studies program that brought together scholars from different disciplines and periods in cooperative research. The group developed a system of analytical categories and created a shared card file of references to organize their research and to facilitate exchange of their findings. In addition to monographs and articles, the group published research guides and indexes. The translation division first translated all available documents of the mid-nineteenth century Taiping Rebellion, then the memorials of the twenty-two leading scholar-officials of the late Qing dynasty. In 1964, Michael joined the faculty of George Washington University, Washington, D.C., where he taught Asian history and directed the Institute for Sino-Soviet Studies and National Defense Education Center until his retirement. Michael introduced an estimated 10,000 students to China and the East Asian area. His successful doctoral candidates include Frederick W. Mote, Alice L. Miller, William Johnson, Richard C. Thornton, Philip Huang, James T. Myers, Harry Lamley, Hugh Kang, Harvey Nelson, Felix Moos and Chang Chung-li. Scholarship on traditional despotism and modern revolution The themes of despotism, cultural synthesis or assimilation, and the modern fate of Confucian humanism shaped Franz Michael's choice of topics in his academic work and public advocacy, and his experience in 1930s Germany directly influenced his anti- totalitarian and anti-communist stance. One of his students wrote after his death that \\"These times no longer welcomed voices like that of Franz Michael who advocated that the Chinese Communists should be taken for what they were and, actually, wanted to be, namely true Marxist-Leninists, and who insisted that the Sino-Soviet conflict needed to be analysed in other than the traditional terms of clashing nationalisms.\\" Michael saw the Chinese Revolution of 1949 as a producing Leninist totalitarianism that betrayed the Confucian humanist tradition, not a continuation of the despotic rule of the emperors. Michael argued that Mao Zedong's tactics derived from Lenin's strategy delivered by guidance from Moscow and that these tactics were not an independent Chinese invention. In the 1950s, he argued in such respected periodicals as World Politics, Orbis and Problems of Communism that the story of the Communist takeover in China in 1949 was \\"not that of a peasant revolution but of a movement organized and led by Communists\\". The Chinese Nationalist government was destroyed in a \\"military defeat\\" not by an uprising of the people. These concerns also shaped his teaching. One of his students, David Shambaugh, wrote that as an undergraduate Michael challenged him, \\"a young liberal, to see how easy it was for unbridled state power to be used in despotic ways.\\" Michael, he went on, \\"was one of the first scholars of Asia to apply the totalitarian paradigm (developed to understand modern fascism and Stalinist communism) to the study of Chinese communism, as he recognized that dictatorship knew no cultural boundaries.\\" Shambaugh observed that \\"this recognition also grew out of his understanding of Oriental Despotism and debates with Karl Wittfogel. =The Qing dynasty= Michael's first monograph was his 1942 study, The Origins of Manchu Rule in China, which addressed the question of whether conquest dynasties fulfilled the cliche that China absorbed its conquerors. One reviewer at the tme, Knight Biggerstaff, wrote that successive conquests of the empire by neighboring peoples has been one of the \\"most perpexing episodes in Chinese history.\\" He continued that Michael's \\"interesting study\\" of the Manchus also \\"throws light upon the earlier alien conquests of China.\\" The Manchus \\"created a mixed culture on the margin of Chinese society and gradually absorbed Chinese ideas and practises as they strengthened themselves against the day when they would be able to extend their power over the entire country.\\"Knight Biggerstaff, (\\"Review),\\" The Far Eastern Quarterly, 2(3), pp. 326‚Äì327. doi: http://10.2307/2049233. Scholars later argued that Michael placed too much weight on the Manchus absorbing Chinese culture and not enough on their creation of a Manchu identity and a style of rule that used Central Asian traditions more than Chinese ones. Mark C. Elliott, a Harvard University scholar of Manchu history, however, distinguished \\"sinicization\\", that is the process of becoming culturally Chinese, from \\"absorption,\\" that is, adding Chinese cultural practices without necessarily losing Manchu identity; he felt that Michael's argument was that Manchus exhibited the former before they embarked on their conquest of China in 1644., p. ?? The University of Washington Project on Modern History organized translations and monographs on the Taiping Rebellion, the mid-19th century civil war that nearly overthrew the dynasty. One result of the Project was Taiping Rebellion in China, published by The University of Washington Press in three volumes, beginning in 1966. The first volume was Michael's narrative history of the movement; volumes II and III contained annotated translations of all of the significant surviving documents produced by the Taipings. S. Y. Teng, wrote that the project \\"may be the best analysis of the Taiping Rebellion so far published, but it is by no means the final work\\". Teng argued that it \\"should be the best\\" because the University of Washington group had worked on this period for a long time, with Michael serving as \\"master writer\\" who has \\"judiciously appraised a huge amount of information,\\" and whose \\"logical organization ties the complicated history together very neatly\\". Later writers expressed both respect and also reservations for the argument in the book. Paul Cohen's Discovering History in China applauded Michael and his collaborators for being exceptions to the general Western emphasis on the \\"shaping role of the Western intrusion\\". Cohen added that Michael characterized the Taiping organization as \\"totalitarian\\" and as providing a \\"system of total control of all life by the state which had no parallel in Chinese history.\\" , pp. 11, 19, quoting Michael Taiping Rebellion Vol I pp. 3-4, 84, 190, 198-199. Frederic E. Wakeman dubbed the approach of Michael and his University of Washington collaborators the \\"Regionalism- Warlordism-Despotism model\\". He wrote that Michael argued that \\"the Manchus... were aroused into founding the Qing only after being exposed to Chinese political institutions through the Ming frontier banner system‚Äù. Wakeman argued that later research using Manchu language sources had undermined this view. Karl August Wittfogel's conception of Oriental Despotism, Wakeman went on, ‚Äúappeared to loom behind the entire structure, one imperial dynast after another participating in a steady growth toward greater and great autocracy\\". The Manchu court's response to the Taiping Rebellion was to allow Han Chinese military leaders to build regional power, creating a precedent for the development of Warlord Era in the twentieth century. H. Lyman Miller replied that Wakeman and others misread Michael‚Äôs views when they assumed that he adopted Wittfogel‚Äôs concept of Oriental Despotism. In fact, Miller says, although both were at University of Washington, Michael was not Wittfogel‚Äôs student, and Michael disagreed with Wittfogel‚Äôs idea that Chinese history was ‚Äúchangeless‚Äù. In particular, Michael‚Äôs work did not imply that the Taiping Rebellion was the forerunner of Mao‚Äôs revolution or that its failure meant that the collapse of the imperial Chinese system left no alternative to revolution. =Tibet and Central Asia= Michael's work on Central Asia continued in the 1980s with a series of articles and the book, Rule by Incarnation: Tibetan Buddhism and its Role in Society and State. The reviewer in Journal of Asian Studies reported that the book used the sociopolitical theories of Max Weber to analyze the \\"fully matured religio-political order\\" of the four centuries before 1959, when the Dalai Lama left Tibet for India. Michaels asks whether a church-state formed on the principle of \\"rule by incarnation\\" can be modernized and whether it could have been if it had not been invaded by China. Michael's answer to both questions is \\"yes.\\" The reviewer in China Quarterly wrote that \\"as a relatively brief and redable introduction to the subject, the reader could do much worse than to turn to it,\\" commenting that \\"broadly speaking, this is the Tibetans' 'own' case, fairly made.\\" He added that \\"one might question the author's view of the Tibetan political system as entirely dominated by Buddhism,\\" paying \\"little attention to the ethnological level of Tibetan life which, it seems to me, gives Tibetan culture much of its resilience and genius....\\" =The Communist Revolution and the People's Republic= In 1956, Michael reviewed recently published works on the Chinese Communist Revolution and how it had come to power in World Politics, a key journal in international relations. He wrote of \\"misconceptions\\" and \\"hurried statements‚Äù that saw Mao leading a peasant revolution, for the peasants themselves \\"never assumed leadership nor were their aims the aims of the Communist revolution\\". Looking at the root causes, Michael said of China's Response to the West edited by Teng Ssu-yu and John K. Fairbank, that in the end the volume \\"does not pose or answer the question of why the imperial state and Confucian society were 'altogether abandoned.'\\" The title of the book and the commentaries in it, wrote Michael, appear to put the blame on the ‚Äúcorrosive influence of Western power and Western ideas‚Äù, but on the other hand one may ask ‚Äúwhether an inner logic... had not brought the Confucian order to a point of decline where a new beginning would have been necessary even without the destructive Western influence... . Confucianism had become so formalized and so closely allied to the imperial state that the fall of the Chinese monarchy brought with it the disintegration of Confucian institutions.‚Äù Major publications =Books and edited volumes=    =Selected articles=    Notes  References   Includes extensive listing of Michael's publications.  , reprinted in *  External links  * Franz H.

This piece of armour would be smaller than the two ocreae worn by parmularii, who carried a smaller,though still somewhat large, shield.

Personal life  Larter was born in Leeds as the eldest daughter of Thomas Larter, a language teacher. The family moved to Torquay, South Devon, around 1857. From 1885, she lived in Barmouth, north Wales, for a period, before moving to Combe Martin, in North Devon, where she lived from at least 1899 until 1909, when she returned to Torquay. She died there on 13 May 1936. She was a member of the Belgrave Congregational Church in Torquay.  Botany  Larter began her botanical studies in 1897 and joined the Devon Association in 1906, being secretary of its new botany committee from 1909. She edited its report in 1914 and from 1920-1923; and was the inaugural chair of the association's botanical section from 1930-1936. She also joined the Torquay Natural History Society in 1909, and was a committee member 1913-1917, 1919-1923 and 1926-1928. She was its vice-president in 1917, 1918, 1928 and 1929, and chair of its botanical section, 1925-1936. The society made her an honorary member in 1932.

Developed by Susan H. Spence and available in various languages, the 45 question test can be filled out by the child or by the parent. Alternatively, an abbreviated form of the test has been developed, with only 19 questions. It has shown equally valid results while reducing stress and response burden in younger participants. There is also another 34 question version of the test specialized for children in preschool between ages 2.5 and 6.5. Any form of the test takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. The questionnaire has shown good reliability and validity in recent studies.

There are some Malagasy manuscripts that date from the 17th century, and a few Swahili manuscripts that may date from the 17th or 18th century. Hausamanuscripts probably all date from the 19th century and after. Numerous texts, written in Arabic script, are preserved in manuscripts, dating from the past four centuries. The earliest datable text is a sizeable compendium of lectures on the ‚Äúreligious sciences‚Äù (l…õulum n ddin) composed in metrical verses by IbrƒÅhƒ´m al-·π¢anhƒÅjƒ´, a.k.a. Brahim A·∫ìnag (d. 1597 CE). The most well- known writer of this tradition is Mu·∏•ammad al-HawzƒÅlƒ´, a.k.a. M·∏•mmd Awzal (ca. 1680-1749 CE). The longest extant text in Shilha is a commentary (shar·∏•) on al-·∏§aw·∏ç, Awzal's manual of MƒÅlikƒ´ law; the commentary, entitled al-Manja Ω ‚Äúthe Pasture‚Äù is from the hand of al-·∏§asan ibn MubƒÅrak al-Tamuddiztƒ´, a.k.a. L·∏•sn u Mbark u Tmuddizt (d. 1899 CE). Important collections of Shilha manuscripts are preserved in Aix-en-Provence (the fonds Ars√®ne Roux) and Leiden. Virtually all manuscripts are religious in content, and their main purpose was to provide instruction to the illiterate common people (of course, with literate scholars serving as teachers). Many of the texts are in versified form in order to facilitate memorisation and recitation. Apart from purely religious texts (almost all of them in versified form), there are also narratives in verse (e.g. Lqist n Yusf ‚Äúthe story of Joseph‚Äù, L…£azawat n Susata ‚Äúthe Conquest of Sousse‚Äù), odes on the pleasures of drinking tea, collections of medicinal recipes (in prose), bilingual glossaries, etc. The premodern written language differs in some aspects from normal spoken Shilha. For example, it is common for the manuscript texts to contain a mix of dialectal features not found in any single modern dialect. The language of the manuscripts also contains a higher number of Arabic words than the modern spoken form, a phenomenon that has been called arabisme po√©tique.Term introduced by Galand-Pernet (1972:137). Other characteristics of manuscript verse text, which are probably adopted from oral conventions, are the use of plural verb forms instead of singular forms, uncommon plural nouns formed with the prefix ida, use of stopgaps such as da…£ ‚Äúagain‚Äù, hann and hatinn ‚Äúlo!‚Äù, etc. These conventions can be linked to the need to make the text conform to fixed metrical formulae.

For her portraits, she most often approaches girls on the street. She chooses her subject matter by finding girls who\\" could be said to have ‚Äòimperfect‚Äô faces and 'flawed' bodies\\". She pre- visualizes the portrait but is open to improvisation. The portraits bring out the \\"inherent grace in their changing faces and bodies.\\" She usually finds the girls in her hometown. She is also trying to capture some of the details of older homes in the area using them as backgrounds. Over the years, Van Meene has also turned to still lives, portraits of animals, and fashion photography. She has been featured on CNN, TIME and more. She is a sought after workshop leader and has been commissioned to do projects by the Pump House to do a series on teenage mothers and the New York Times commissioned her to travel to Japan to photograph Japanese girls. Early life and education Hellen van Meene was born in Alkmaar, the Netherlands. Her mother gave her a camera at age 15. Van Meene began taking photographs at age 16 when she would photograph her friends, which ultimately segued into the artist continuing to focus on adolescent girls in her professional photography with the aim of examining the construction of femininity in adolescence. For her undergraduate degree, Van Meene studied Fine Art at Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. Other notable photographers who also graduated from Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam include Ger van Elk, Rineke Dijkstra, Peter Klashorst, Dana Lixenberg and Anton√≠n Kratochvil. During her studies, van Meene spent a brief period in 1995 at the Edinburg College of Art. Other notable alumnae of this institution include Paul Rooney, Katie Paterson, and Paul Carter.  Photography  = Early Work = Five years out of art school, van Meene was shortlisted for the Citibank Photography Prize (2001) and signed with New York's Matthew Marks gallery. Much of van Meene's early work is focused on photographing young girls in old houses in her hometown of Alkmaar. As van Meene gained recognition for her work, she expanded her subject matter further. She spent some time working outside of her home country, in England, Russia, Latvia, the United States and Japan. In 2004, van Meene photographed a series of mothers and expecting women from Russia, the United Kingdom and Latvia. In the 2007 series, Going my Own Way Home, van Meene photographed residents of an impoverished neighbourhood in the post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, focusing more on the cultural and economic context of her subjects than in her previous works. = Major Themes = Van Meene's portraits are more often of pubescent girls, clothed in softly coloured tops and dresses. Her subjects‚Äô clothing and gestures as well as the location and lighting are all planned by the artist, despite it seeming unclear how much of the scene is a candid moment of the subject's life captured by the photographer. Van Meene is quoted as saying that she finds beauty in the ‚Äúunpolished, still evolving‚Äù adolescent girls and ‚Äúthe tension between her subjects‚Äô their childlike awkwardness and their near-adult bodies.‚Äù Some publications have noted the ‚Äúinnocently erotic‚Äù element that is present in these photographs. The sexuality present in these photographs provokes discomfort in the viewer and raises the question of whether the models are aware of their sexuality and the effect it has on the viewer or whether they are unaware of the connotations of the way they have been positioned by the artist. = Style = Hellen van Meene has admitted in interviews that she pre-plans her photographs and carefully chooses the pose, garment and location for each photograph. She has stated that she chooses the location of older homes as a way of immortalizing them. Van Meene's work is recognizable not only by the consistent subject matter and lighting she uses, but also by the artist's consistent use of a square format and shots that are set up from a medium focal range. Some articles have also noted the painterly influence in van Meene's work, referencing the dream-like quality of the photographs and the softly-lit rooms in which her subjects are photographed. Van Meene's portraits are distinguishable by the detached appearance of her subjects and her style that straddles the border between creating a fantasy world and documenting contemporary youth.  Collections  Van Meene's ‚ÄúThe Years Shall Run Like Rabbits‚Äù is a play on the speed at which rabbits reproduce and the idea that unhappy or uncomfortable moments are fleeting. This collection was created from 1994-2015 and primarily features square portraits of adolescent girls. From 1995-1998, van Meene worked on a collection called ‚ÄúSeries Blanc‚Äù which featured a girl in a transparent white lace dress, lacking undergarments. This photograph prompts the viewer to question whether or not the young subject is aware of the sexual nature of the image or still too innocent to understand. In 2005, the New York Times commissioned a portfolio of photographs of young Japanese women. The magazine is quoted as saying that ‚Äúcaptured in van Meene‚Äôs work is the less stylized [than kitsch or anime] (but still stylish) vernacular of everyday Japanese girlhood. It is a look at once fashionable and ingenious, tender but not without the occasional flush of teenage allure.‚Äù Van Meene approached adolescent girls on the street in Tokyo and photographed them against nearby backdrops. In 2010, van Meene began photographing dogs alongside her adolescent subjects. Maintaining the same attention to detail and planning as in her earlier portraits. Van Meene has stated that in this collection, she is less concerned with the sociological message in her work and more interested in curating ‚Äúlight, shape, posture, gaze and general mise-en-scene.‚Äù She is also aware of her now-recognizable style and has noted that it is not the girls that make her work unique, but the way she styles them and uses light, gaze and posture to create a scene.  Influence  Hellen van Meene's photographs have been compared to paintings by Dutch Masters such as Vermeer and Rembrandt for her use of natural light and the formal composition of the photographs. Other scholars have compared van Meene's portraits to those by Cindy Sherman, the differentiating feature being that van Meene's work focuses on other people as her subjects rather than the artist herself as Sherman did. Both create artificial scenes and use irony to undermine the authenticity of a photograph. The photographic documentation is used to frame a ‚Äúperformance event‚Äù as a constructed space, but one that provokes an emotional response to the staged scenario without context or commentary by the artist. Hellen van Meene herself mentions Francesca Woodman as being an inspiration for her work. Woodman's work focuses entirely on the body, often omitting her subject's faces, however perhaps this speaks to the importance of what the bodies of van Meene's subjects communicate and the emphasis she places on this element.  Exhibitions  Over the course of her 23-year career from 1994 to 2017, van Meene has had one-person exhibitions in Los Angeles, Amsterdam, London, Milan, Tokyo and at the Venice Biennale and has exhibited at Sadie Coles HQ in London (2000, 2008), The Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago (2002), Folkwang Museum in Essen (2007), and Fotomuseum Winterthur (2008). Her work has also been included in major group exhibitions like the Biennale for Architecture in Venice (2000), Fotografen in Nederland een Anthologie at Gemeente Museum Den Haag (2002), In Sight: Contemporary Dutch Photography from the Collection of the Stedelijk Museum at The Art Institute of Chicago (2005), Family Pictures at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (2007), Paris Photo in Carrousel du Louvre in Paris (2008), Faces in the Nederlands Fotomusem in Rotterdam (2015) and at Matthew Marks Gallery in New York, the Marc Foxx Gallery in LA, Le Case d‚ÄôArte in Milan, Galleria Laura Pecci in Milan, Galiere Paul Andiresse in Amsterdam and The Photographer's Gallery in London.  Critical Reception and Recognition  Publications including Photo District News (PDN), i-D Magazine, TIME, Art Photography Now, The New York Times and The New Yorker have published articles about Hellen van Meene and reviewed a variety of her collections/exhibitions. According to Scott Tillett at Photo District News, the Matthew Marks Gallery signed van Meene based on her ‚Äústrong work, feeling that people perhaps respond to the painterly influence in her portraits.‚Äù Similarly, Alastair Sooke wrote in the Telegraph, referring to van Meene's portraits as ‚Äúmeticulously composed portraits of young women‚Ä¶Vermeer-like in its enigmatic tranquility and sensuous evocation of texture and subtle light.‚Äù Such comments that reference Dutch masters appear to be commonplace in reviews of van Meene's photography. In another exhibition review, Christopher Miles notes that the photographs in van Meene's first solo US exhibition at The Marc Foxx Gallery ‚Äúafford the viewer insight into a self knowledge being gained by the young women in the pictures‚Ä¶All images in this exhibition blur the boundaries between public and private moments, between voyeurism and innocent observation on the part of the photographer/viewer, and between distinctions as to whether the girls depicted are acting naturally, being posed, self-consciously posing themselves, or, more strangely, naturally assuming artificial poses.‚Äù Van Meene faced controversy in 2002 surrounding a photo in her Edinburgh exhibition which showed a young woman in her undergarments bent over the side of a bed. Though critics noted that this controversy was misplaced, it is understood that van Meene's photographs have an underlying sexual element to them and can create an uneasiness within the viewer. In 2016, Van Meene was one of the recipients of the Royal Photographic Society Honorary Fellowship, which is awarded to distinguished people within the science or fine art of photography.  Recent Projects  Hellen van Meene's work was recently exhibited at the Hague Museum of Photography and at the Villa Mondrian in the Netherlands. In 2018, Van Meene was the focus of an exhibit called ‚ÄúAnd everything goes on when you die‚Äù at Huis Marseille in Amsterdam. It showed a never before exhibited series of photos from the artist, and its subject matter centered around death, mourning, and renewed vitality. Several of Van Meene‚Äôs works were exhibited as part of the 2019 show ‚ÄúMake Believe‚Äù at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

During one of the s√©ances there was \\"spontaneous appearance of images on film\\", though Gauld discovered that the locked box was \\"easily opened in the dark, which allowed for easy substitution of film rolls.\\" Reception Gauld's The Founders of Psychical Research (1968) documents early investigations into paranormal phenomena. The book received a mixed review by Robert Kent Donovan who praised the research but complained that Gauld was biased in support of the authenticity of the findings from the psychical researchers.Donovan, Robert Kent.

The poem - composed in Sapphic stanzas - has only two places of uncertainty in the text. The seriousness with which Sappho intended the poem is disputed, though at least parts of the work appear to be intentionally humorous. The poem makes use of Homeric language, and alludes to episodes from the Iliad. Preservation The Ode to Aphrodite survived from antiquity. It was preserved in Dionysius of Halicarnassus' On Composition, quoted in its entirety as an example of \\"smooth\\" or \\"polished\\" writing, a style which Dionysius also identifies in the work of Hesiod, Anacreon, and Euripides. It is also partially preserved on Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2288, a second-century papyrus discovered at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. Though the poem is conventionally considered to be completely preserved, there are two places where the reading is uncertain. The first is the initial word of the poem: some manuscripts of Dionysios render the word as \\"\\"; others, along with the Oxyrhynchus papyrus of the poem, have \\"\\". Both words are compounds of the adjective (literally 'many-coloured'; metaphorically 'diverse', 'complex', 'subtle'); - means 'chair', and - 'mind'. is the standard reading, and both the Lobel-Page and Voigt editions of Sappho print it. Hutchinson argues that it is more likely that \\"‚Äì\\" was corrupted to \\"‚Äì\\" than vice versa. However, Anne Carson's edition of Sappho argues for , and more recently Rayor and Lardinois, while following Voigt's text, note that \\"it is hard to decide between these two readings\\". The second problem in the poem's preservation is at line 19, where the manuscripts of the poem are \\"garbled\\", and the papyrus is broken at the beginning of the line. Yet another possible understanding of the word takes the second component in the compound to be derived from , a Homeric word used to refer to flowers embroidered on cloth. While apparently a less common understanding, it has been employed in translations dating back to the 19th century; more recently, for example, a translation by Gregory Nagy adopted this reading and rendered the vocative phrase as \\"you with pattern-woven flowers\\". Poem Aphrodite, the subject of Sappho's poem. This marble sculpture is a Roman copy of Praxiteles's Aphrodite of Knidos. The poem is written in Aeolic Greek and set in Sapphic stanzas, a meter named after Sappho, in which three identical longer lines are followed by a fourth, shorter one. In Hellenistic editions of Sappho's works, it was the first poem of Book I of her poetry. As the poem begins with the word \\"\\", this is outside of the sequence followed through the rest of Book I, where the poems are ordered alphabetically by initial letter. At seven stanzas long, the poem is the longest-surviving fragment from Book I of Sappho. The ode is written in the form of a prayer to Aphrodite, goddess of love, from a speaker who longs for the attentions of an unnamed woman. Its structure follows the three-part structure of ancient Greek hymns, beginning with an invocation, followed by a narrative section, and culminating in a request to the god. The speaker is identified in the poem as Sappho, in one of only four surviving works where Sappho names herself. The sex of Sappho's beloved is established from only a single word, the feminine in line 24. This reading, now standard, was first proposed in 1835 by Theodor Bergk, but not fully accepted until the 1960s. As late as 1955 Edgar Lobel and Denys Page's edition of Sappho noted that the authors accepted this reading \\"without the least confidence in it\\". Sappho asks the goddess to ease the pains of her unrequited love for this woman; after being thus invoked, Aphrodite appears to Sappho, telling her that the woman who has rejected her advances will in time pursue her in turn. The poem concludes with another call for the goddess to assist the speaker in all her amorous struggles. With its reference to a female beloved, the \\"Ode to Aphrodite\\" is (along with Sappho 31) one of the few extant works of Sappho that provides evidence that she loved other women. The poem contains few clues to the performance context, though Stefano Caciagli suggests that it may have been written for an audience of Sappho's female friends. The Ode to Aphrodite is strongly influenced by Homeric epic. Ruby Blondell argues that the whole poem is a parody and reworking of the scene in book five of the Iliad between Aphrodite, Athena, and Diomedes. Sappho's Homeric influence is especially clear in the third stanza of the poem, where Aphrodite's descent to the mortal world is marked by \\"a virtual invasion of Homeric words and phrases\\". Classicists disagree about whether the poem was intended as a serious piece. Arguing for a serious interpretation of the poem, for instance, C. M. Bowra suggests that it discusses a genuine religious experience. On the other hand, A. P. Burnett sees the piece as \\"not a prayer at all\\", but a lighthearted one aiming to amuse. Some elements of the poem which are otherwise difficult to account for can be explained as humorous. For instance, at the beginning of the third stanza of the poem, Sappho calls upon Aphrodite in a chariot \\"yoked with lovely sparrows\\", a phrase which Harold Zellner argues is most easily explicable as a form of humorous wordplay. Aphrodite's speech in the fourth and fifth stanzas of the poem has also been interpreted as lighthearted. Keith Stanley argues that these lines portray Aphrodite \\"humorous[ly] chiding\\" Sappho, with the threefold repetition of followed by the hyperbolic and lightly mocking Notes References External links * English translation of the poem by Elizabeth Vandiver Category:Ancient Greek poems Category:LGBT poetry Category:Works by Sappho ","title":"Ode to Aphrodite"},{"id":"47739945","text":"Batavia is a city in and the county seat of Genesee County, New York, United States. It is near the center of the county, surrounded by the Town of Batavia, which is a separate municipality. Its population as of the 2010 census was 15,465. The name Batavia is Latin for the Betuwe region of the Netherlands, and honors early Dutch land developers. The city hosts the Batavia Muckdogs baseball club of the New York‚ÄìPenn League, at the Dwyer Stadium, at 299 Bank Street. The Muckdogs are an affiliate of the Miami Marlins. They won the 2008 championship. In 2006, a national magazine ranked Batavia third among the nation's micropolitans based on economic development. The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes north of the city. Genesee County Airport (GVQ) is also north of the city. Its UN/LOCODE is USBIA. History =The Holland Land Company= All of western New York was sold through this office of the Holland Land Company, which is now a museum. The current City of Batavia was an early settlement in what is today called Genesee Country, the farthest western region of New York State, comprising the Genesee Valley and westward to the Niagara River, Lake Erie, and the Pennsylvania line. The tract purchased in western New York (the Holland Purchase) was a 3,250,000 acre (13,150 km) portion of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase that lay west of the Genesee River. It was purchased in December 1792, February 1793, and July 1793 from Robert Morris, a prominent Revolutionary banker, by the Holland Land Company, a consortium of Dutch bankers. The village of Batavia was founded in 1802 by Joseph Ellicott, agent of the Holland Land Company.History of Batavia, New York from Our County and Its People: A Descriptive and Biographical Record of Genesee County, New York (1899) Batavia, New York, was named for the short-lived Batavian Republic (1795‚Äì1806) in honor of the Holland Land Company. The Batavian Republic was named for the Batavi, an ancient Germanic tribe, which lived in the Rhine‚ÄìMaas delta in the central Netherlands. During the Renaissance in the Low Countries (1500s) and Dutch Golden Age (1600), Dutch nationalists formed the \\"Batavian myth\\" and argued that the ancient Batavians were the ancestors of the Dutch.The Batavian Myth : A Study Pack from the Department of Dutch, University College London This region is now known as Betuwe, a Dutch word derived from \\"Batavia.\\" One of the provisions of the sale was that Morris needed to settle the Indian title to the land, so he arranged for his son Thomas Morris to negotiate with the Iroquois at Geneseo, New York in 1797. About 3,000 Iroquois, mostly Senecas, arrived for the negotiation. Seneca chief and orator Red Jacket was adamantly against the sale, but his influence was thwarted by freely distributed liquor and trinkets given to the women. He acquiesced and signed the Treaty of Big Tree, in which the tribe sold their rights to the land except for a small portion for $100,000. Mary Jemison, known as The White Woman of the Genesee, who was captured in a raid and married her Seneca captor, was an able negotiator for the tribe and helped win more favorable terms. In the negotiations Horatio Jones was the translator and William Wadsworth provided his unfinished home. The land was then surveyed under the supervision of Joseph Ellicott, a monumental task and the biggest land survey ever attempted to that time. Ellicott, as agent for the company, established a land office in Batavia in 1802. The entire purchase was named Genesee County in 1802, with Batavia as the county seat. The company sold off the purchase until 1846, when the company was dissolved. The phrase \\"doing a land office business\\", which denotes prosperity, dates from this era. The office is a museum today, designated a National Historic Landmark. Ellicott lived in Batavia for many years although he thought Buffalo would grow to be larger. Batavia has a major street named after him (Ellicott Street), as well as a minor street (Ellicott Avenue), and a large monument in the heart of the city. Batavia was incorporated as a village in 1823. The present counties of western New York were all laid out from the original Genesee County, and the modern Genesee County is but one of many. But the entire area as a region is still referred to as Genesee Country. Thus, Batavia was the core from which the rest of western New York was opened for settlement and development. =Masonic Lodge scandal= A scandal erupted in Batavia in 1826, when William Morgan was offended by the local Masonic Lodge (Western Star Chapter R. A. M. No. 33 of Le Roy, New York), and threatened to expose the lodge's secrets. He was arrested on a minor charge, then released when his charge was paid, into the company of several men, with whom he went, apparently unwillingly. It was developed later that the men were Masons, and they carried him to Fort Niagara, where he was held captive and then disappeared. Although the Masons claimed he was only bribed to cease publication and leave the area forever, public sentiment was that he was murdered. No conviction was ever obtained. His captors were only charged and convicted with his abduction. The event roused tremendous public furor and anti-Mason sentiment. Anti-Masonry was a factor in politics for many years afterward, leading to the creation of the Anti-Masonic Party, as well as religion. Many Methodist Episcopal clergy had joined the Masons, and this was one of the reasons the Free Methodist Church separated. =Erie Canal= The Erie Canal in 1825 bypassed Batavia, going well to the north at Albion and Medina, enabling Buffalo and Rochester to grow much faster. With the sale of the western part of the state completed, Batavia became a small industrial city in the heart of an agricultural area. It became known for the manufacture of tractors, agricultural implements, sprayers and shoes. It also was a tool and die making center for industries in other areas. The largest manufacturer, Johnston Harvester Company came into being in 1868. In 1910, the business was acquired by Massey-Harris Co. Ltd, and became a subsidiary of that Canadian company, founded by Daniel Massey in 1847. Batavia grew rapidly in the early 20th century, receiving an influx of Polish and Italian immigrants. The City of Batavia was incorporated in 1915. =Recent history= Oatka Milk plant still processes milk from area dairy farms which are fewer but larger in recent times. Batavia is part of what has become known as The Rust Belt. In recent years much of the heavier industry left for other areas of the US, or abroad, and according to U.S. Census data there has been a gradual but consistent decline in the town's population from 1960 forward. The construction of the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility, a federal immigration detention center next to the airport has provided more jobs in the area, as well as expansion of the airport, including lengthening the runway to accommodate larger aircraft in 2005. Inmates at the detention center have included terrorism suspects, such as Nabil Ahmed Farag Soliman, who embarked on a hunger strike in 1999 after two and a half years in federal detention. In August 2012, Muller Quaker Dairy broke ground on what was to be one of the largest yogurt manufacturing plants in the United States, and employed 170 people in December 2015.

Geography and climate =Geography= Old mill dam at the Big Bend of the Tonawanda, downtown Batavia, New York. The choice of this site for Ellicot's headquarters was probably influenced by a good mill site. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 5.2 square miles (13.6 km), of which, 5.2 square miles (13.4 km) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km) of it (1.14%) is water. New York State Route 5 (east-west) intersects New York State Route 33, New York State Route 63, and New York State Route 98 in the city.
