Ujaleshwar is located in the Barshitakli Tehsil administrative division. Its neighboring villages include Kajaleshwar and Nimbhara. Ujaleshwar's nearest rail station is in Barshitakli, and its nearest airport is Akola Airport.  Etymology Ujaleshwar (in Marathi (उजळेश्वर, Ujaḷēśvar) is named after the God Ujaleshwar, also known as Shiva. Ujale (उजळे) is defined as enlightened, and Shwar (ईश्वर) translates to God. सर्वांचे कल्याण करणारा देव म्हणजे उजळेश्वर. History Records show that Ujaleshwar existed at the time of the Maratha empire in the 18th century. Numerous coins from the Shivaji Maharaj have been found from excavations around the village. For a sizable amount of the village's history, its inhabitants were poor and lacked opportunities to earn wages. The villagers worked on farms in nearby villages such as Tamsi and Nimbhara, since Ujaleshwar inhabitants could not support their own agriculture due to a lack of water. The Government of Maharashtra later built numerous dams in the area, enabling irrigation and farming. The village has since grown economically, providing employment opportunities for local residents.  Population  In 2011, a national census concluded that the population of Ujaleshwar was 851 with 184 families. This included 96 children 0-6 years old, 10.53% of the population. The sex ratio is 884, which is below the average sex ratio of Maharashtra State. The literacy rate is 86.52%, higher than the state's average of 82.34%.  Religion  Religions practiced in the village include Hinduism, Buddhism, and Brahmanism.  Festivals  Festivals are an important part of village life, and the people of Ujaleshwar celebrate many, including Navratri, Ganeshotsav, and Shivaji Jayanti. During Navaratri Utsav, the inhabitants of Ujaleshwar perform the Garba dance. The event is particularly popular among younger men and women.

The church is situated in the neighbourhood Brabrand by Brabrand Lake, west of Midtbyen. The church was originally devoted to St. Martin but is today a parish church in the Church of Denmark, serving a parish population of 6.962 (2015). The Brabrand Church pastorate is shared with the South Aarslev Church to the west. The resistance fighter Alf Tolboe Jensen, executed during the Second World War, is interred in the church cemetery.  History  The church was originally situated in the village of Brabrand which has over time developed into a neighbourhood of Aarhus. Population in the parish has increased a lot which has left a substantial mark on the church as it has been altered and enlarged a number of times. It is difficult to determine which are the original part and which are later additions. The cross-hatched area in the ground-plan shows, the chancel and the east part of the nave are all that is preserved of the first stone-built church on the site. The oldest sections of the building may well date back to the latter half of the 12th century.  Architecture  The oldest sections are built of rough and split granite boulders. Few original windows are still to be found in the chancel and there are moulded imposts in the chancel arch. The relatively solid brick masonry at the west end of the earlier part of the church seems to indicate that a tower, which has since disappeared, was added to the nave in the Late Middle Ages. A porch, of which a few remains may have been included in the present extension for the altar dates from the same period. Formerly a wooden spire rose above the west end of the church but was replaced in 1880 by the present tower in its Neo-Romanesque style. In 1924—25 the church was thoroughly rebuilt and to the north side of the nave was added a large extension two bays long with a porch. This change involved a 90° turn in the orientation of the church, since the altar was set up in an annex on the south side of the original nave. A further extension was undertaken 1969—70. Romanesque tombstone. In the southern wall of the church is a well- preserved romanesque gravestone with an engraved processional cross in the centre. The Latin text surrounding the cross is \\"HAC CLAVSVS : PETRA CVM : XRO : REGNET IN : ETHRA\\" roughly translated to \\"May he, who is interred under this stone, rule with Christ in Heaven\\".  Interior  The walls in the chancel show traces of murals, but it was on the north wall that a fairly large fragment, since covered once more with whitewash, was found with a figured scene within a banded frame. This has been interpreted by some as Samson tearing down the gate of the city of Gaza, by others as Moses coming down the mountain with the Tablets of the Law. The furniture was restored and added to when a considerable rebuilding programme took place in 1924—25. In particular the altarpiece which was decorated by Per Glarmester (Lit. Per Glazier) in 1595. A former altarpiece painting was produced by the animal painter Christian David Gebauer. The chalice was donated 1551 by Bishop Ove Bille (1520—36), as indicated by a tablet inscribed in Latin. A cross embroidered in gold and silver is preserved from the back of a chasuble, now disappeared, dating back to c. 1725. The pewter dish of the granite Romanesque baptismal font was made 1686 by Hans Nielsen Gotlænder, who worked in Århus, and donated to the church by the patron, Constantin von Marselis, and his wife Sofia Elisabeth Carisius. The pulpit from c. 1650 is from the same workshop as the pulpits in Åby and Trige. The bell was cast 1744 by Lorenz Strahlborn of Lübeck.

Metal spinning is a lesser known metal forming and fabricating manufacturing process. It is more conventionally used for the manufacturing of axis-symmetric parts. Its ability to create parts that require high tolerance and high strength makes it an outstanding process to manufacture a wide range of parts for automobile, aerospace, defence and medical industries. Typical components produced by metal spinning are lamp bases, reflectors, hollowware (pitchers, tankards, vases, candlesticks, etc.), pots, bans bowls and components for electrical equipment. Design for manufacturability (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture. The concept exists in almost all engineering disciplines, but the implementation differs widely depending on the manufacturing technology. DFM describes the process of designing or engineering a product in order to facilitate the manufacturing process in order to reduce the manufacturing costs. DFM will allow potential problems to be fixed in the design phase which is the least expensive place to address them. Other factors may affect the manufacturability such as the type of raw material, the form of the raw material, dimensional tolerances, and secondary processing such as finishing. Depending on various types of manufacturing processes that are set guidelines for Design for manufacturability (DFM) practices. These DFM guidelines help to precisely define various tolerances, rules and common manufacturing checks related to DFM. Below are certain rule based standard guidelines which can be referred to while designing parts for metal spinning considering manufacturability in mind.  Design Considerations  The most common guidelines following design recommendations are not mandatory rules but rather suggestions for promoting ease of manufacture: = Metal Thickness = The thickness of the metal to be spun can vary from about 0.1 mm (0.004 in) to 120 mm (4 or 5 in) on special machines and with hot material. The most common thickness, however, are 0.6 to 1.3 mm (0.024 to 0.050 in). Maximum thickness and size are limited only by the size of the equipment and the power available to make the metal flow. Specifying material 25 or 30 percent thicker than the finished-part thickness is usually sufficient to allow for such reduction in wall thickness. However, material too thick for easy spinning should not be specified. Both extra-thick and extra-thin materials make spinning more difficult. For precision work, extra thick metal pieces may be spun and then machined to final dimensions. = Shape = In spinning, the conical shape is the easiest to form and the most economical. The metal is not subjected to such severe strain when worked down to its extreme depth because the angle at which the chuck meets the metal is small and allows better control of the metal during the spinning operation. The hemispherical shape is more difficult to spin because the angle grows increasingly sharper as the metal is forced farther back on the chuck. In spinning a cylinder, the metal is exposed to greater strain because of the sharp angle. This operation requires more time and skill. = Radius at corners = Blended radii and fillets are preferable to sharp corners for ease of spinning. Sharp corners tend to cause thinning of stock and, in the case of external corners, breakage of wood or masonite chucks. A desirable minimum is 6 mm (1/4 in), although 3 mm (1/8 in) usually causes no problems. In the spinning process, a metal is exposed to larger strains at sharp angles. = Spinning Ratio = Spinning ratio is defined as depth to diameter ratio and serves as a critical metric for the spinning process. A rating of 100 indicates maximum suitability for the type of spinning indicated, while lower rating values indicate proportionally less ease of forming with spinning methods. It is preferred to use as shallow part as possible, i.e. avoid deep cylindrical designs, which require repeated operations and annealing. A spinning ratio of less than 1:4 is preferable. Spinning ratios are normally classified as follows: Shallow (less than 1:4), Moderate (1:4 to 3:4), Deep(3:4 to 5:4). = Tapering Angle = If the part has cylindrical sides and a wood chuck is used, allow a taper of 2° or more, if possible, to facilitate removal of the part from the chuck. With steel chucks, less taper is required, as little as 1/4° will be satisfactory. = Other Design Considerations = * It is preferred to avoid reverse-form designs, if possible, because they require additional operations and can cause considerable thinning of stock. * The flatness of a flat-bottomed part will not be improved by the spinning operation. If bottom rigidity is important and flatness is required, a cone angle of 5° will provide rigidity and is easy to spin. * A stiffening bead also can be rolled on the edge of the spun shell. It is preferable, from a production standpoint, to have the bead face outside rather than inside the part. Otherwise, re-chucking in a hollow external chuck will be necessary because both inside and outside beads are formed in air with no chuck support.  Feature Based Rules  Internal flanges and other configurations of re- entrant shapes are more costly to produce because they require special, more complex chucks or spinning without backup support for the work. Also, it is preferred to dimension parts to surfaces adjacent to the chuck (usually inside dimension). This allows the chuck maker to apply these dimensions directly to the chuck, and it avoids variations in diameter or length caused by variations in material thickness.

They were also used in France, Italy and Scotland. The practice lasted until the 19th century, and in a few cases into the 20th century. The dit name poses challenges for genealogists confronted with different surnames in different documents, particularly if they are not familiar with the custom. Dit and the feminine form dite translate as \\"called\\" and are the past participle of the French word dire, \\"to say\\". A name such as Adolphe Guillet dit Tourangeau can translate as \\"Adolphe Guillet, called Tourangeau\\", where both \\"Guillet\\" and \\"Tourangeau\\" are used as surnames, sometimes together and sometimes individually in different situations. The dit name carried the same legal weight as the original family name with regard to land transfers and the naming of children. Dit names developed for a variety of reasons, such as distinguishing one family from another nearby family with the same surname, or allowing an adopted child to retain both their birth and adopted family names. In some cases, both the original name and the dit name were retained. For example, Miville-Deschênes. A family's dit name often derived from a personal attribute (Leblond, Leblanc, Leroux), place of origin (St-Onge, Coderre, LeBreton), or profession (Chartier, Meunier, Vanier). For example, an immigrant to New France from Paris might receive the dit name Parisien, and a person who worked as a blacksmith might receive the dit name Lefebvre. Sometimes, the name could be ironic. A large person could be 'Tiny' or Petit. The custom originated in the military, where those with the same name adopted noms de guerre to distinguish themselves. Children often adopted the dit name, sometimes dropping the original family name. Sometimes some of the children chose to take only the family name and others only the dit name.

Scope of work PLC technicians are knowledgeable in overall plant systems and the interactions of processes. They install and service a variety of systems including safety and security, energy delivery (hydraulic, pneumatic and electrical), communication, and process control systems. They also install and service measuring and indicating instruments to monitor process control variables associated with PLCs, and monitor the operation of PLC equipment. PLC technicians work with final control devices such as valves, actuators and positioners to manipulate the process medium. They install and terminate electrical, pneumatic and fluid connections. They also work on network and signal transmission systems such as fibre optic and wireless.Cox, Richard (2006) Technician’s guide to Programmable Logic Controllers, 3rd Edition, P.44 Along with the calibration, repair, adjustment and replacement of components, PLC technicians inspect and test the operation of instruments and systems to diagnose faults and verify repairs. They establish and optimize process control strategies, and configure related systems such as Distributed Control Systems (DCSs), Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition (SCADA), and Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs). PLC technicians maintain backups, documentation and software revisions as part of maintaining these computer-based control systems. Scheduled maintenance and the commissioning of systems are also important aspects of the work. PLC technicians consult technical documentation, drawings, schematics and manuals. They may assist engineering in plant design, modification and hazard analysis, and work with plant operators to optimize plant controls. PLC technicians use hand, power and electronic tools, test equipment, and material handling equipment. They work on a variety of systems including primary control elements, transmitters, analyzers, sensors, detectors, signal conditioners, recorders, controllers and final control elements (actuators, valve positioners, etc.). These instruments measure and control variables such as pressure, flow, temperature, level, motion, force and chemical composition.PLC Technician overview PLC systems designed and maintained by PLC technicians range from high speed robotic assembly to conveyors, to batch mixers, to DCS and SCADA systems.

For several years in the 1990s Big Boy Records ruled the bounce and hip hop music industry in New Orleans until No Limit Records and Cash Money Records arrived. History Big Boy's first signee was pioneering New Orleans rapper Sporty T (Terence Vine). He had previously been a founding member of The Ninja Crew, New Orleans' first rap group to record. In the early 1990s, inspired by hits by Juvenile and Everlasting Hitman's bounce hits, he moved in that direction as well. The label's first single was \\"Sporty Talkin' Sporty.\\" Though bounce, it had an uncharacteristically heavy sound for the genre. After it sold 4,000 copies, Big Boy sought out more talent. In that same year Big Boy Signed Partners-N-Crime, a rapping duo from Hollygrove, New Orleans. When they dropped their single \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\" in 1994 it became an instant hit. Months later their debut album PNC 3 hit the stores. Later on in that year G-Slimm's Fours Deuces & Trays sold 200,000 copies. However, the label's first huge success came from a recently returned Gulf War veteran, Mystikal (Michael Ernest Tyler). The 12th Ward native had originally been with Parkway Pumpin as Mystikal Mike. Then he was poached by Big Boy, who released \\"I'm Not That Nigga\\" and a self-titled debut which sold 300,000 copies. Apparently bolstered by this considerable windfall, Big Boy made most of their promotional videos in the wake. After Mystikal signed with No Limit and the death of G-Slimm, Big Boy records slowly began to fall apart. In 2004 they released Big Boy Greatest Hits compilation album featuring all the greatest hits from 1992-2000. In 2015, Charles \\"Big Boy\\" Temple died.

He was previously known as one of the most prominent members of the Halifax Rainmen, who played in the Canadian league as well as the Premier Basketball League (PBL) and the American Basketball Association (ABA). After announcing retirement in 2012 with the Rainmen, he became the first NBL Canada player to have his jersey retired. However, he returned to the league in 2013, when he started competing for the Mill Rats. Since joining the Rainmen, Crookshank is often nicknamed \\"Air Canada\\" due to his slam dunking capabilities.  Early life  Crookshank was born on November 13, 1978 at the Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, California. His father was the leader of a local gang and a part-time streetball player. He has formerly played college basketball at Lake Marriott University in Oakland, California. Despite this, Eric admired his father because of his vengeance, confidence, control, and passion. In his autobiography, he said that he looked up to him \\"like he was the president.\\" He lived with his younger sister Shirley and his mother, who was a drug addict. He also had an older brother that had problems with depression. Eric's mother died from ovarian cancer in 2008, an event that would profoundly affect his personal life.  Professional career  Two years after graduating from Cal State Dominguez Hills, in 2007, Crookshank signed a professional contract with the Halifax Rainmen of the American Basketball Association (ABA). He immediately improved the team, averaging 20.5 points per game and earning All-Star honors. Crookshank instantly became well known around the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was considered a fan favorite and led the Rainmen in scoring in his first season with the team. However, on January 14, 2009, after Halifax moved to the Premier Basketball League (PBL), Crookshank was suspended for the season after criticizing team head coach Rick Lewis in the public after he had to play off the bench. The forward later said, \\"I was very arrogant. It was me first and whoever second. I didn’t care about anybody but myself.\\" Rainmen owner Andre Levingston said Crookshank would later \\"thank him for it.\\" The suspended player remarked, \\"I lost my mother and this is probably the second worst thing that has happened to me in my life. But life goes on.\\" Despite this, he could attend his team's games and was paid. Off the court, he took part in community service and began speaking to children at schools about responsibility. Crookshank decided to return to the same team once he was reinstated and started playing under a new coach Les Berry. He was named PBL Defensive Player of the year by the end of the season and finished second in Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. In 19 games, he averaged 14.5 points, 13.0 rebounds and 1.5 blocks.

Ryczek. He spent his entire career in minor leagues, beginning his career with the Holyoke Merchants/Knights before signing on with the Springfield Acorns of the Atlantic Coast Football League in 1963. He played two years there, including the 1964 season when he rushed for a league-record 1,460 yards.Dr. Ken (September 2013). ONE DEFINITION OF \\"MINOR LEAGUE\\" FOOTBALL, PART TWO . HelmetHut.com. Retrieved September 10, 2015. He then moved back to Holyoke, joining the now-renamed Bombers as they joined the ACFL. In 1966, Meeks moved to Hartford, Connecticut and played for the Hartford Charter Oaks of the Continental Football League. When the Charter Oaks disbanded in 1967, he remained in Connecticut and became a charter member of its replacement, the Hartford Knights of the ACFL. 1968 would prove to be another high point for Meeks's career; as part of a tandem with fullback Marv Hubbard (who would later go on to a three-time Pro Bowl career with the Oakland Raiders), the two would finish first and second in league rushing yardage as the Knights went onto that year's league championship. Meeks would continue to play minor professional football until 1970. Meeks was a power runner who amassed 4,198 yards over the course of his six seasons in the ACFL and an additional 512 yards with the Charter Oaks. There was much speculation as to why Meeks never made it to the National Football League or American Football League, even as the existence of the latter league had expanded the number of opportunities for professional players (at least one contemporary report suggests he did have a preseason stint with the Minnesota Vikings, but he never made that team or any other's regular season roster).The Ottawa Journal from Ottawa - Page 20 Most commonly cited are his relatively old age at the peak of his success, a perceived lack of quickness, and his lack of college football experience; some unnamed teammates also alleged Meeks, who was black, was the victim of racism, and his generally modest personality may have prevented him from fully promoting his career. Personal life Meeks was married and had three children, one by birth and two through adoption. His biological son and one of his adopted sons shared the same name (Richard) and age (both were born in 1957).

Walters was a 1979 Ohio Supreme Court case relating to the funding of primary and secondary schools in Ohio. The Court ruled that the method of funding public schools at the time was constitutional despite disparities in per-pupil education spending between different districts. Article VI of the Ohio Constitution states that the state must provide an \\"adequate system of public schools.\\" The ruling overturned a previous trial court ruling that the State's school-funding system violated the Constitution of Ohio's requirement of providing a thorough and efficient system of public education. Board of Education v. Walters is one of the cases that played a role leading to DeRolph v. State of Ohio in 1997, which found the model of funding for public schools in Ohio to be unconstitutional. Background The plaintiffs of this case brought suit claiming that Ohio held the responsibility to fund its public schools. The Cincinnati school board filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Ohio school districts that believed they were underfunded. The plaintiffs believed that the system of funding, a mixture of state and local funding, violated the constitutional requirement to provide sufficient funding to operate a school district. Furthermore, they argued that forcing a school district to adequately fund its district violated the education provisions of the State Constitution. At the trial court level, the method of funding for public schools was deemed unconstitutional. However, on appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court reversed that decision and upheld the constitutionality of the school funding method. The Ruling The Ohio Supreme Court justices argued that despite the inequalities that existed between school districts in terms of funding and ability to raise local revenue, there was no basis to strike down the funding method. They agreed with the defendant, in this case the Cincinnati Board of Education, that local control of school districts served as a rationale to defend the funding inequalities. The court stated that the local control of school districts \\"meant not only the freedom to devote more money to the education of one's children but also control over and participation in the decision-making process as to how those local tax dollars are to be spent.\\" The court did not answer the questions of whether the Ohio General Assembly at the time fulfilled their constitutional requirement to provide a \\"thorough and efficient\\" system of public schools, despite the trial court's ruling stating that the Assembly did not. Furthermore, the court declined to state what constitutes a \\"thorough and efficient\\" system of public education. By leaving these questions unanswered, whether intentionally or not, the court allowed for the school funding model to be revisited in future court cases. In addition, the court defended their decision by explaining that the state had taken steps to close the disparities in school funding. The state of Ohio gave extra money to school districts that levied 20 mills of property tax up to a maximum of 30 mills. The court used this rationale to explain that the inequalities were not unconstitutional because the state made an effort to even out funding through that policy. Despite upholding the method of funding, the court kept the possibility of further court cases regarding education funding alive. The Court stated that the structure of funding would become unconstitutional if a school district failed to receive enough funding from all sources that it could not operate adequately. This made it possible for the funding of schools in Ohio to be struck down in the case DeRolph v. State.

The church is situated in the neighbourhood Åbyhøj, west of Midtbyen. The church is today a parish church in the Church of Denmark, serving a parish population of 10.925 (2015). The Åby Church pastorate is shared with the Åbyhøj Church to the north.  History  The church is situated in the western neighbourhood Åby which was formerly a village. The original church constructed of ashlar was built c. 1200 and in the Late Middle Ages it was lengthened towards the west. Two imposts in the chancel arch which were transferred to the new building, the one in the south is, owing to its cylindrical shape, assumed to be an imitation in stone of a decorated wooden post.  Architecture  The present building was constructed in 1872-73 when it was decided it wasn't economical to renovate the former medieval church. The church was designed by Vilhelm Theodor Walther, who worked as the royal building inspector for Jutland at the time, in romanesque style imitation inspired by Italian elements. The walls are bands of yellow and red bricks and the building resembles a traditional apse, chancel, nave and tower. In 1929 the tower spire was made taller and clad in copper. In the north wall by the tower a walled off entrance with a staircase presents a curiosity. In older churches there was typically a north and south entrance - men and women entrances - and in most churches the north entrance have later been walled off. The original medieval church also had two entrances and it is thought the architect Vilhelm Theodor Walther chose to emulate this by deliberately putting in a walled off entrance.  Interior  While nothing in the interior remains from the original church a couple of items of church furniture were transferred from the demolished church and are still in use. These are the altar-piece from 1598 with a carved crucificial group in front of the middle panel and Old Testament paintings on the side panels and the Romanesque baptismal font of granite. A crucifix from the latter half of the 11th century has been in the National Museum since 1870. It is probably the earliest of the Jutland crucifixes which belong with the »golden altars« and was presumably made in the same workshop as the Lisbjerg altar.

Del Col has been a lifelong fan of the characters and was successful in working with Simon & Schuster to secure the comic book rights and then pitch to publishers. Inspired by Archie Comics' Afterlife with Archie, Del Col is quoted as saying, \\"So, then I started to think, 'Huh, I wonder what other characters are out there that are well-known that could be rebooted like that,'\\" Del Col said. \\"That's when I started to look around and I looked in some properties, and then I thought, 'Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys. Oh, that would be really cool to do a hard-boiled noir take on them.' \\" The series finds characters Frank and Joe Hardy accused of murdering their father, Fenton Hardy, and turning to a femme fatale-esque Nancy Drew to clear their names. The series features artwork by Italian artist Werther Dell'Ederra with covers by UK artist Fay Dalton. Del Col credits editors Matt Idelson and Matt Humphreys with helping him shape the direction of the series. The series debuted to positive reviews. Comics blog Readingwithaflightring.com declared it, \\"the best 'modern' approach to updating a franchise like this that I've seen. It works on every level and still fully embraces the heart of who they are.\\" Aintitcool.com reviewer Lyz Reblin stated, \\"The strength of the series thus far is Ms. Drew, who was absent for most of the first issue. She is a pitch-perfect modernized femme fatale, who could hold her own up against any present-day Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, or the like.\\"  Created First Female Lead in Assassin's Creed Del Col, along with his Kill Shakespeare co-writer Conor McCreery, was hired by Titan Comics to launch a new comic series based on the successful Assassin's Creed video game franchise. The series was the first to star a female modern-day lead character, Charlotte de la Cruz and garnered a great amount of positive reviews. Leading comics site TheMarySue.com said, \\"It's a fantastic video game based title; it really captures a lot of spirit of Assassin's Creed…captures your imagination from the get-go.\\" Del Col and McCreery's run on the series ran from 2015 – 2017.  Son of Hitler In 2018, Del Col co-created the Image original graphic novel Son of Hitler with writer Geoff Moore and artist Jeff Mccomsey.https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/son-of-hitler Matt O'Keefe of ComicsBeat called it a \\"page-turning graphic novel\\", offering \\"an alternate history story with obvious respect for the actual events of World War 2\\". Son of Hitler is a noir spy-thriller centering around a conspiracy to take down Hitler in the last days of World War Two. Del Col expressed his personal love for historical fiction, noting his love for the \\"shadows and blindspots\\" that populate the area between historical fact and fiction. Son of Hitler brings together many aspects of Del Col's comics work in one volume; it shares the historical elements of Del Col's Kill Shakespeare and Assassin's Creed comics and the classic mysterious noir elements of his Nancy Drew & The Hardy Boys.  Luke Cage: Everyman  In 2018, Del Col wrote the series Luke Cage: Everyman for Marvel Comics. Jahnoy Lindsay provided the interior art with covers by Declan Shalvey. Everyman was a Marvel Digital Original released as 3 single issues and collected as a trade paperback in November 2019. Reviewers praised it for being \\"bold\\" and \\"political\\", pitting Luke Cage against a CTE diagnosis as well as villains in his own community. Everyman was called an interesting unconventional look at the Marvel universe, with critics highlighting Del Col's humanizing portrayal of Luke Cage and Lindsay's realistic depiction of Harlem.  Personal life  Del Col currently lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his wife, Lisa.

She made two cruises, capturing three prizes, but during her second cruise the Royal Navy captured her at Saint Lucia. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Surprize. She served in the Caribbean, and was one of the two sloops that captured Essequibo and Demerara in March 1781. She sailed to Britain in late 1782 where the Navy sold her in 1783. The French Navy may have purchased her. If so, they sold her in 1789. Bunker Hill Bunker Hill, under the command of Edward Rolland, departed on her first cruise in mid-June 1778. She returned on 26 September, having captured one vessel, which was possibly the 50-ton (bm) brig Mary, Thomas Mallowney, master.American War of Independence - At Sea: Bunker Hill — accessed 10 September 2015. Commander Nicholas Ogelbe commissioned Bunker Hill on 27 October. On 2 December he sailed her from Salem, intending to cruise off Barbados. Two days out of port Bunker Hill captured the 100-ton (bm) schooner Delaware, Thomas Butler, master. She was sailing from Quebec to New York with a cargo of flour. Ogelbe sent her into Salem. Later, Bunker Hill captured a second vessel. On 22 December Bunker Hill sailed into Grand Cul De Sac Bay, Saint Lucia at night. She had made an error in navigation and thought she was joining up with the French fleet under Count d'Estaing, which was anchored about a league away from the British fleet under Admiral Barrington that had captured St Lucia. In the morning she discovered that she was anchored within cannon-shot of the British. Bunker Hill struck and the boats of Barrington's fleet took possession of her before any French vessel could intervene. Barrington decided to take her into service as she was a fast sailer and he had just been informed that the French had captured .Remembrancer, Vol. 7, pp.282-5. HMS Surprize Admiral Barrington renamed Bunker Hill Surprize in recognition of the manner of her capture. The Royal Navy commissioned Surprize on 25 December 1778 with Barrington promoting Lieutenant James Brine, first lieutenant of into her as master and commander. Barrington paid £1017 7s 1¾d for Bunker Hill on 6 January 1779. He manned Surprize with 125 men. He also arranged an exchange of prisoners, the crew of Bunker Hill for the crew of Ceres.The Connecticut Journal [New Haven], 24 February 1779. On 3 April 1779 Surprize captured the Elizabeth.

Shortly before they arrived, six British privateers had raided Essequibo and Demerara, captured sixteen Dutch ships, and forced the de facto surrender of the colonies.

She was the first woman elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in a general election. Fitzgerald, the daughter of James Henry Thomas and Ina Medora Thackston, was a native of Cherokee County and a graduate of Winthrop College, from which she received her degree in 1916; she also held an MA degree from the University of South Carolina and another MA from Columbia University, and performed further graduate work at the University of Chicago. She worked for some time as a schoolteacher, and served in a number of positions with the South Carolina Department of Education, including as a school community organizer, rural school supervisor, and director of elementary education. In 1941 she married Columbia businessman James Madison Harris Fitzgerald. She was an active member of many organizations, including the Business and Professional Women's Club, the League of Women Voters, Delta Kappa Gamma, United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Daughters of American Colonists, South Carolina Vocational Rehabilitation, the Altrusa Club, and the Salvation Army. For the Daughters of the American Colonists she served as editor of the Colonial Courier magazine. She also served as Executive Secretary of the South Carolina Governor's Commission on the Status of Women, and was Recording Secretary of the National Executive Board of the National Order of Women Legislators. Fitzgerald was elected to the House in 1950, and served eleven terms as a Democrat, representing Richland County. She began her tenure as the only woman in the entire House of Representatives. Among causes for which she advocated during her time in office was the service of women as jury members, but the bill which she presented to allow this continually died in committee, and was not passed until she left office. She also supported higher pay for public school teachers. She was named Woman of the Year by The Progressive Farmer in 1960. Fitzgerald decided to run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1962. Her opponent in the primary was Corinne Boyd Riley, running to complete the term of her deceased husband; it was believed to be the first time in South Carolina history that two women had competed against each other in a congressional election. Fitzgerald's challenge of Riley was considered somewhat surprising, as it was tacitly understood among South Carolina's political class that any widow running to succeed her husband would remain unchallenged in the general election. Nevertheless, Fitzgerald claimed that her time as a state legislator made her more qualified to hold the position. Riley was still in mourning for her late husband and did no strenuous campaigning, promising only to pursue his agenda as best she could and to retire at the end of her term. Even so, Riley won the primary by a two- to-one plurality, carrying all eight counties in the district; she would later describe her victory over Fitzgerald as \\"rather surprising\\". Fitzgerald ran for Congress again in 1965 and was again defeated in the primary. Fitzgerald is buried in the churchyard of the First Presbyterian Church in Columbia. An archive of papers relating to her time in public service is held by the library of the University of South Carolina, while another, similar archive is held by her alma mater.

She is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and founding director of the Laboratory for Social-Emotional Development and Intervention, as well as founding director of the Centre for Child Development, Mental Health, and Policy at the University of Toronto Mississauga. Tina is known for her research on the affective bases of aggression and prosocial behavior in children, as well as the development and testing of socio-emotional interventions for enhancing kindness and mental health and reducing the negative effects of exposure to violence and trauma in children facing varying levels of adversity. She is President-Elect of the International Society for the Study of Behavioural Development (ISSBD) and serves as an Associate Editor of Child Development.  Education  Tina Malti earned a Ph.D. in developmental psychology from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Free University of Berlin, under the supervision of Wolfgang Edelstein. She also obtained a postgraduate M.A. in clinical child psychology from the Academy of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Children and Adolescents in Switzerland and a Habilitation in psychology from Free University of Berlin.  Research  = Research expertise = Tina Malti’s research focuses on the foundations, pathways, and antecedents of aggression and kindness in children. She adopts a clinical-developmental framework to generate new knowledge on why children and adolescents engage in behaviors that are harmful or beneficial to others, with a focus on the role of emotional processes in such behaviors. To study how both other-oriented and self-conscious emotions, such as sympathy and guilt, affect aggression and kindness, she uses a variety of approaches, including cross-sectional, large- scale longitudinal, and experimental designs, as well as randomized controlled trials. She also employs psychophysiological, neurocognitive, and genetic assessments to delve deeper into their underlying mechanisms. Based on the findings from this research, she and her team develop and implement tailored social-emotional intervention approaches to prevent and reduce aggression and promote kindness in children with varying levels of exposure to trauma, stress, and violence. Tina has published over 180 empirical journal articles, book chapters, and books. She is a co-editor of the Handbook of Child and Adolescent Aggression. Her research has been profiled in The New York Times, The Atlantic, Der Spiegel, as well as other print and media outlets. = Leadership = In 2019, Tina created and established the Centre for Child Development, Mental Health, and Policy at the University of Toronto Mississauga, and she became its founding director. The vision of this multi- disciplinary research centre is to foster every child’s healthy development and potential for kindness, both locally and globally.

In May 2014, Gordon Moore announced that McCormick was leaving the Moore Foundation to co-found a startup to create the first global, open-source database on ecosystem services and natural capital, called The Earth Genome. McCormick is a board member for many social impact and environmental organizations.  The Nature Conservancy  McCormick is credited with reorganizing The Nature Conservancy (TNC) into a \\"truly global entity to fulfill its mission.\\" During his tenure, the group grew to operate in 30 countries and all 50 states in the United States, with revenues in excess of $650 million, with its assets increasing to $5.4 billion. McCormick began his career with TNC in 1976 as western regional legal counsel. He then spent 16 years as executive director of California and Western Region. In 2004, he asked TNC's science staff to develop a framework to guide global conservation at the organization, which ultimately produced The Atlas of Global Conservation to collate environmental information He led the effort to create and incorporate the strategic framework that still guides the group's work, called Conservation by Design (see \\"Method\\" at The Nature Conservancy). On June 8, 2005, McCormick defended TNC's land acquisition practices in front of the United States Senate Committee on Finance, after a 2003 Washington Post article, Nonprofit Land Bank Amasses Millions, questioned TNC's motives. An academic study of the incident concluded that the Post's analysis was \\"reductionist\\" to the point of \\"misleading.\\"  The Moore Foundation  As president and CEO of the Moore Foundation, McCormick wrote prolifically on the importance of supporting basic science, especially for environmental conservation. McCormick oversaw more than $1 billion in grants, many of which were granted to scientific research, including $34.2 million to simulate experimental research in the physics of quantum materials and $12.5 million (joint with Sloan Foundation) to the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. McCormick left \\"abruptly\\" with much speculation as to why. It became clear in subsequent months that McCormick left to create a 501(c)(3) non-profit, The Earth Genome, to make environmental information more accessible, using best practices from the tech industry.  Board service and awards  McCormick has served on numerous boards, including The Independent Sector, Sustainable Conservation, the California Academy of Sciences, and the advisory board of the UC Berkeley College of Natural Resources.

It centers on the fortunes of a down-on-his- luck educational administrator at the fictional Cow Eye Community College. Plot Built around a cattle industry now in decline, the town of Cow Eye Junction is experiencing a severe drought, a demographic incursion, and an ongoing cultural clash as older residents are displaced by a new wave of outsiders moving in. The college, meanwhile, is struggling to maintain its accreditation and to reconcile two rival factions: those who eat meat, and those who will not. Hoping to resolve this situation, the college hires the narrator, Charlie, to serve as Special Projects Coordinator. Struggling to find his place in life as a self-described “habitual divorcee and father of nothing,” Charlie is repeatedly drawn into outlandish situations over the course of the novel as he tries to help the college achieve regional accreditation, reconcile a divided faculty, and resurrect the college's annual Christmas party. Authorship controversy The novel drew attention in September 2015 when critic Art Winslow, the longtime Nation books editor, argued in Harper's Magazine that the novel is the work of American author Thomas Pynchon. Nate Jones at Vulture argued against Pynchon's authorship; he contacted Penguin Books directly and was reportedly told: \\"We are Thomas Pynchon's publisher and this is not a book by Thomas Pynchon.\\"Jones, Nate.

Early life and education  Vida Latham was born in Lancashire in 1866 to a physician father. Her early education took place in Cambridge and Manchester. She earned her master's degree from the University of London in 1889; she published papers on tooth anatomy and pain in 1888 while working at a London dentist's office. She then moved to the United States because she could not practice in the UK with an American dentistry degree. She earned her DDS in 1892 from the University of Michigan, and her MD from Northwestern University in 1895.  Career and research  While studying for her DDS, she was a demonstrator in comparative dental anatomy and pathological bacteriology as well as a museum curator. While studying for her MD, Latham was a secretary and lectured in stomatology and dental surgery at Northwestern, and in pharmacy. She served as an oral surgeon at the Women's and Children's hospital from 1892–1897. Concurrently, she was on the faculty of the American Dental College, though she held this position until 1898. Latham was a member of Chicago's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1902. She joined the Illinois State Dental Society in 1918 and became a lifelong member. From 1929–1931 she was an attending physician at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, where she spent the rest of her career from 1929 on as a microanalyst and physician. Latham was also a prolific journal and book editor, including the Medical Woman's Journal, the Polk Dental Dictionary, and the Standard Medical Dictionary. She researched throughout her career on oral surgery, operative dentistry, the neural anatomy of the jaw and teeth, palate tumors, oral cavity cysts, facial fractures, lead poisoning, aniline dyes, specimen preparation, blood tests for diabetes, the vasomotor system of teeth, and neoplasms of the tooth pulp. She spent her career advocating for a more rigorous dentistry curriculum and for women in both dentistry and medicine.

It is attributed to the Bishop Pilgrim of Passau in 971 to 991 and contained forged epistles that dealt with the definition of the bishopric's jurisdiction.  Background  Most specialists agree that the collection of documents, known as the Forgeries of Lorch, was completed for Pilgrim, who was made Bishop of Passau in 971. After he came into conflict with Frederick I, Archbishop of Salzburg for the ecclesiastic jurisdiction in Pannonia, Pilgrim forged the papal bulls. The earliest of the bulls was attributed to the 4th-century Pope Symmachus. Pilgrim believed that Lauriacum (now Lorch in Enns in Austria) was the metropolitan see of the Diocese of Pannonia in the Roman Empire. He also thought that the see had been moved from Lauriacum to Passau. Documents Pilgrim's forgeries include six papal documents falsified or corrupted by Bishop Pilgrim of Passau between 971 and 985 as scribes of the royal firm, a letter from the bishop to Pope Benedict VI or Benedict VII. There were also two alleged letters of Archbishop Hatto from Mainz to an unnamed Pope. A total of five papal bulls were forged and one of the letters from Hatto of Mainz to an unknown Pope, attempted to prove that Lorch was an archiepiscopal see before Salzburg. Pilgrim's counterfeits, were to make the diocese of Passau the legal successor to the ancient archbishopric of Lauriacum, thus establishing the rank of an archbishopric. This late antique bishopric Lauriacum (Lorch, Austria) was mentioned in the Vita Sancti Severini. One of the specific contents involved the claim that Saint Peter sent missionaries to convert Lorch in the year 47 and establish a see. Furthermore, the documents also indicated that Passau be endowed with a vast archdiocese, immense property, and no less than twenty-two suffragan bishoprics including Grado, Wurzburg, and Prague.

Stella Inquisitorus uses, and is compatible with, the Second Edition of the In Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritas rules. Plot overview The plot is set in 6993 AD. At the dawn of the 21st century, God and Lucifer ended the Great Game and revealed their existence. This triggered Armageddon. Both factions began fighting openly, demanding that humans choose their side or die. A faction of pagan humans, the Vikings, rejected both sides and sought a glorious death in heroic combat. Earth became a radioactive wasteland after the Catholic Fleet bombarded it from orbit to defeat the Antichrist. Later, faster-than-light travel by passing through Paradise or Hell was discovered, opening up space to colonization. Technology is banned or controlled. God formed the militantly Catholic Stella Vaticanum (\\"Star Vatican\\"), an empire that covers half of existing space. The masses under His protection are ruthlessly monitored by the Inquisition. Any sign of heresy or Demonic corruption in a subject planet's population is punishable by genocide. The other half is controlled by the satanic Dunkle Reik (\\"Dark Empire\\"). Each subjugated planet is ruled by a Demon Lord viceroy who has moulded it to fit the incarnation of their Demon Prince's Word.

He has served as Deputy Commander of the PLAAF since 2013 and previously as Commander of the Jinan Military Region Air Force and the Nanjing Military Region Air Force. Biography Zheng Qunliang was born in January 1954 in Wafangdian, Liaoning Province. He joined the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in March 1970. He served in the 41st division of the PLA Ground Force until 1974, when he entered PLAAF No. 5 Aviation Academy. He joined the Air Force upon graduation in 1977. From 1984 to 1986 he studied at the PLA Air Force Command Academy. Zheng is a top-grade jet fighter pilot. When he reached the PLAAF's compulsory non-flight age of 47, he had accumulated 2,200 flying hours. He became commander of Regiment 3 of the 1st Division in 1992, then division commander in 1997. In a transregional combat drill under no pre-set flying conditions, he led the division to a deployment at another air base, breaking PLA records for the largest number of aircraft moved on a single mission, traveling the longest distance, and the longest flying time under instrument only (blind flying) flight conditions. In 1999 he was the in-flight commander for the Air Force National Day Military Parade. The review formation was long, and passed the review stand at Tiananmen Square exactly on time, to the second. This exhibition won him high praise from PLAAF leaders. In 2002 he was promoted to commander of the Wuhan Air Base. He was named Chief of Staff of the Shenyang Military Region Air Force in February 2008, Deputy MRAF Commander in December 2010, and concurrently MRAF Commander and Deputy MR Commander in July 2011. In December 2012, he was transferred to the Nanjing Military Region Air Force to serve in the same concurrent positions. In July 2013, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the PLAAF. Zheng attained the rank of major general in July 2005, and lieutenant general in July 2012. In November 2012, he was elected an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Visit to the United States As commander of the PLAAF's elite 1st Fighter Division, Zheng was selected to participate in a PLA senior officers' delegation to visit the United States in July 2000, a sign that the PLA had identified him as a future leader in the air force. After his trip, he wrote a widely distributed article recounting his experiences visiting various U.S. Air Force bases. For instance, he noticed it took only 15 minutes for an F-15 wing to change munitions, as compared with three hours in his division. He was highly impressed that USAF F-15 fighter pilots took off in formation, even under heavy clouds below 200 meters (something his own pilots could only do individually under the same conditions) and landed out of steep, descending turns. He was surprised to find non-commissioned officers supervising flight operations (a task performed only by commanders in a PLAAF fighter division). Zheng concluded that if his commanders could be freed from such duties, they could devote their attention to more important tasks. He concluded that the more the PLA understood the U.S. military, the more the PLA would understand its own shortcomings and be motivated to catch up.

The museum is situated in the university campus in the district Midtbyen. The museum was founded in 1949 by a professor from Aarhus University as a study collection in classical archaeology. The basis of the collection was 500 artifacts from the ancient cultures around the mediterranean donated by the National Museum and a number of plaster casts of antique sculptures from a museum in Aarhus. In 1971 the present exhibition area was inaugurated and since then the collection has been much expanded through purchases, presents and donations. The new physical framework and the many additions meant the collection could serve a wider audience than university students and the name of the collection was changed to the Museum of Ancient Art. In 2003 the museum was renovated and has since hosted a number of special exhibits.  Collection  The museum collection includes about 4000 original artifacts from the ancient cultures in the mediterranean. The mummy of the tempel singer Tabast and amulets in earthenware, clay figurines, bronze bowls and incense tubs illustrates Ancient Egypt and other Near Eastern oriental cultures. Ancient Greece is represented with a collection of ceramics from Mycene, black and red-ceramics from Athens and decorated ceramics from Corinthia. Votive offerings for the gods and burial gifts to the dead in the form of clay figures in bronze and drinking cups shows aspects of religious life. Lamps, utensils, keys, game pieces and glas shows everyday life in Roman society. The Greek coin collection is one of the most extensive in Northern Europe with about 2500 Greek and Roman coins spanning the East Greek city states in present-day Turkey to coins from the Hellenic kingdoms.

The Kaga ikki was a faction of the Ikkō-ikki, mobs of peasant farmers, monks, priests, and jizamurai (lesser nobility) that espoused belief in Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism. Though nominally under the authority of the head abbot of the Hongan-ji, the Monshu, the ikkō-ikki proved difficult to control. During the Ōnin War, the ikki in Kaga, with the approval of the Monshu Rennyo, helped restore Togashi Masachika to the position of shugo (military governor). However, by 1474 the ikki fell into conflict with Masachika, and in late 1487, they launched the Kaga Rebellion. Masachika was overthrown, and Togashi Yasutaka, his uncle, took his place as shugo. Under Yasatuka's son, Taneyasu, the Kaga ikki asserted more and more influence over the provincial government. In 1531, a civil war erupted as two factions within the Kaga ikki vied for control. Renjun, a son of Rennyo, won the war, abolished the position of shugo, exiled Taneyasu, and established a much tighter Hongan-ji hegemony over the province. In 1546, the Kanazawa Midō was established as a governing body in Oyama Gobo, which would eventually grow into the present-day city of Kanazawa. The Midō oversaw very loosely organized committees of select warlords and priests, who in turn ruled over the local lords and village leaders. The Kaga ikki controlled Kaga until they were overrun by the forces of Oda Nobunaga in a series of campaigns lasting from 1573 to 1582. History =Emergence of the ikki in Kaga= Rise of the Ikkō-ikki Throughout the 15th century in Japan, peasant revolts, known as ikki, increased in frequency. With the outbreak of the Ōnin War in 1467 and resultant chaos, they became even more commonplace. Many of the rebels embraced a militant offshoot of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism known as Ikkō-shū. The religious leader Rennyo, eighth Monshu of the Hongan-ji school of Jōdo Shinshū, tried to distance himself from Ikkō-shū, but attracted many converts from the sect to the point were Ikkō-shū became synonymous with Jōdo Shinshū. Due to the violent tendencies of Ikkō-shū adherents, they became known as ikkō-ikki, literally \\"Ikkō-shū riots\\" or \\"Ikkō-shū league\\". In 1471, Rennyo relocated from Kyoto to Yoshizaki in Echizen Province. Rennyo had attracted his largest following in Echizen and the bordering Kaga Province, a following which included not only peasants but jizamurai, or kokujin, the lesser nobility. Togashi civil war In Kaga, a civil war had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika for control of the position of shugo over the province. Kochiyo was victorious against his brother and drove him out of Kaga. When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo sided with the Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, reached out to the Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, he promised to end their religious persecution and lift them out of poverty. The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though alarmed by the rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his support as well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power. =Kaga Rebellion= Despite having aided Togashi Masachika in his return to power, within a year the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga fell into conflict with him. Claiming that he failed to adequately deliver on his promises of economic reward, the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga revolted in 1474. Rennyo refused to support these rebellions, and the Ikkō-ikki were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in neighboring Etchū. Shimotsuma Rensu, a ji-samurai from Echizen and an advisor to Rennyo, led another revolt, falsely claiming that Rennyo authorized his actions. This revolt also failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu. Though the early revolts in Kaga failed, unrest continued in the province, as the Ikkō-ikki would refuse to pay taxes and even seize tax revenues and land, despite Rennyo's admonitions of submission to the authorities. In 1487, possibly in an effort to secure a favor in the form of military aid, Masachika responded to shōgun Ashikaga Yoshihisa's call for military aid against Rokkaku Tokoyori in Ōmi Province. In Masachika's absence, the Ikkō-ikki launched a massive revolt, their forces numbering between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand. Though Masachika quickly returned, the rebels, aided by several disgruntled former vassal families and nobility, overwhelmed him and trapped him in his castle, where he committed seppuku. To replace Masachika as a shugo, the vassal families which opposed Masachika put forward his uncle, Yasakuta, who had previously been a shugo of the province. Ashikaga Yoshihisa was enraged by the rebellion and ordered Rennyo to excommunicate his followers in Kaga. However, Hosokawa Katsumoto, a personal friend and ally of Rennyo, brokered a deal which allowed Rennyo to merely reprimand the Kaga ikki. = Rule under Togashi Yasakuta and Taneyasu = After the overthrow of Togashi Masachika, Kaga became known as \\"the kingdom of peasants\\" and \\"hyakusho no motaru kuni \\" (\\"province ruled by peasants\\"). However, the Kaga ikki were content to live under the rule of Masachika's uncle, Yasutaka. When, in 1493, Hosokawa Masamoto deposed shōgun Ashikaga Yoshitane, Yasakuta and Yoshitane fled to Kaga. Yasakuta then led several campaigns in an effort to restore the shōgun, including two invasions of Echizen: one in 1494 and another in 1504. None of these campaigns featured ikki participation. However, after Yasakuta's death, the ikki asserted more control. They initiated two invasions, one in Etchū in 1506, and one in Echizen in 1508, both in support of ikki rebellions within those respective provinces. By the 1520s, the Kaga ikki had become the primary governmental faction within Kaga. =Kaga civil war= In 1531, the ikki control of Kaga was of such dominance that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province in a civil war, often called the Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, came to power in the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were backed by the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was backed by many of the smaller temples and emerged victorious from the conflict when he brought in an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province. Togashi Taneyasu was exiled, as were the other opposition leaders, and the position of shugo abolished. =Rule from Oyama Gobo= In the year immediately after the civil war, 1532, Rennyo led the Ikkō-ikki in a campaign to aid Hosokawa Harumoto against Miyoshi Motonaga. During that conflict, the Hongan-ji headquarters at Yamashina was burned down, and Rennyo established a new city in Settsu Province called Ishiyama Hongan-ji, the predecessor to modern-day Osaka. Due to the Kaga civil war and its aftermath, the Hongan-ji acquired large amounts of land in Kaga and thus exerted a powerful economic influence over the region. To manage its increased responsibilities, the Hongan-ji established the Kanazawa Midō, based in the city of Oyama Gobo, in 1546, to oversee Kaga's affairs from then onward. Oyama Gobo quickly grew to a population of 3,000–5,000, establishing the beginnings of what would become the present-day city of Kanazawa. Under the Midō, control of the province was centralized, to the point that rule under it resembled the rule of the daimyōs elsewhere in Japan. =Conquest by Oda Nobunaga= In 1570, daimyō Oda Nobunaga began a campaign against the Ikkō-ikki, besieging the Hongan-ji headquarters at Ishiyama Hongan-ji and attacking ikki strongholds throughout Japan. By 1573, forces led by Akechi Mitsuhide and Toyotomi Hideyoshi pushed through Echizen and into the southern portions of Kaga. A counter-attack by the Kaga ikki in 1574 halted this advance, causing Nobunaga to personally lead the assault into Kaga. In 1575, Nobunaga recaptured Echizen, and Mitsuhide and Hideyoshi again invaded Kaga, this time more rapidly, successively capturing the fortified temples of Daishōji, Hinoya, and Sakumi. By the end of the year, the southern half of Kaga was conquered, and in November of that year Nobunaga boasted to Date Terumune that he had \\"wiped out several tens of thousands of the villainous rabble in Echizen and Kaga.\\" Nobunaga granted Echizen to his general Shibata Katsuie, and in 1576 Katsuie's nephew Sakuma Morimasa penetrated deeper into Kaga, capturing Miyukizuka. In 1580, Morimasa destroyed the capital, Oyama Gobo. The same year, Ishiyama Hongan-ji surrendered. Despite the resistance of the Ikkō-Ikki being effectively suppressed, a few Kaga ikki fled the plains and entrenched themselves in the mountains at the fortified temples Torigoe and Futoge. Shibata Katsuie captured these strongholds in 1581, but the garrisons he established were over-run and the temples recaptured. Still in the year 1581, Katsuie and Sakuma Morimasa again recaptured the temples, killing all the Ikkō-ikki at the sites. Despite this, in 1582, resistance elements again recaptured Torigoe and Futoge. A third attack was mounted by Morimasa, and this time the final resistance elements were eliminated, ending the last vestiges of ikki rule in Kaga. Governance The government structure of the Kaga ikki evolved over time. After the 1488 revolt, Togashi Masachika's uncle Togashi Yasakuta ruled as shugo, and little changed in the decentralized, feudalist structure of Kaga. Along with Yasakuta, several different factions also controlled Kaga. Three sons of Rennyo; Rengo, Renkō, and Rensei, headed the three Hongan-ji temples and led the ikki faction. Several former Masachika vassals, including the Mootori and Yamagawa, also held power. Historian David L. Davis explains that although 1488 is the conventional date given for the beginning of Ikki control in Kaga, it was only under Togashi Yasakuta's son Taneyasu that the ikki began asserting control over the government, becoming the dominant faction in the 1520s. He cites court documents from Kyoto to support his assertion: Until 1504 (when Yasakuta died), the shōgun and shōen considered Yasakuta the legitimate government; from 1504 to 1521, they were uncertain, and after 1521 they would send legal papers to the Hongan-ji office immediately outside of Kyoto. Likewise, military expeditions were initiated by Yasakuta during his tenure. For instance, he made several attempts to restore Ashikaga Yoshitane to power, which included two invasions of Echizen, in 1494 and 1504, respectively. However, after Yasatuka's death, the ikki in Kaga launched an invasion of Etchū in 1506 and Echizen in 1508, both times in support of ikki rebellions in those respective provinces, and both times without any contributions from the old vassal families. In 1531, Renjun, a son of Rennyo, emerged victorious in the Kaga civil war and established a much tighter Hongan-ji hegemony over the province. The leaders of the opposition, including Togashi Taneyasu, where expelled from Kaga, though those who supported them were allowed to return. Without any central governing body, Kaga was consumed by political instability. The Asakura clan to the south and Uesugi to the north posed threats of invasion for Kaga, so the ji-samurai established a centralized authority at the Kanazawa Midō in Oyama Gobo. The Midō oversaw four district organizations of hatamoto – prominent local warlords. Each hatamoto commanded a group, kumi, of which there were roughly twenty in total. These kumi in turn ruled over regional groups of local warriors, priests, and the heads of village communes. The highest political organization of the ikki in Kaga was a committee of hatamoto, and the only permanent political body were the twenty kumi. Important matters would be settled at the meetings of the local hatamoto in consultation with the local Hongan-ji priests. However, these meetings were sporadic and held at the county, rather than provincial, level, and thus, according to Davis, would probably rarely have involved more than five hatamoto and one or two Hongan-ji priests. Kumi meetings were probably similar, with the exception that a hatamoto present at a kumi meeting would have held great respect.

The theatre's origins dated from 1866, with various remodelling and rebuilding throughout its history. Its final building opened as the New Opera House in 1901, and was renamed the Tivoli in 1914 when it joined the Tivoli circuit. The Tivoli eventually closed in 1966. Early years In the years following the Victorian gold rush, Melbourne's population and affluence was thriving, and entertainment venues were regularly established. One such venue was the Australia Hall, a small variety theatre build above livery stables. The Australia Hall opened on 2 November 1866, and was described as \\"of the exceedingly unpicturesque order of architecture.\\" It was eventually redecorated and rechristened several times, before burning down in 1869. Three years later, in 1872, a new theatre was erected on the site by tramway pioneer Henry Hoyt and George H. Johnson. Opening on 24 August, the Prince of Wales Opera House was a large, four level auditorium seating 2500 patrons.West, John. Theatre in Australia. Its first lessee was opera impresario William Saurin Lyster. Harry Rickards In 1895, British actor-manager Harry Rickards took over the lease of the Opera House and made it the Melbourne headquarters of his growing business. Rickards presented a range of music hall/vaudeville entertainment for the city's increasingly affluent middle class by importing international talent, including Charles Godfrey Leland, Ada Reeve, and W. C. Fields. New Opera House Facade illustration of the New Opera House, Melbourne, 1900. Source: State Library of Victoria At the turn of the century, safety concerns forced the closure and eventual demolition of the Opera House. Rickards commissioned the Melbourne architect William Pitt to design a replacement theatre, and the New Opera House opened in May 1901, during the celebrations of the first Parliament of the new Federation of Australia. Rickards' Tivoli circuit now included venues in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide, and became one of the world's most respected, lucrative, and powerful vaudeville touring enterprises. Rickards died in London on 13 October 1911, and the New Opera House, as well as the Tivoli business, was sold to boxing entrepreneur Hugh D. McIntosh. In 1914, in line with the other venues on the national circuit, the New Opera House was renamed the Tivoli. Tivoli, the home of variety For the next half-century, the Tivoli was Melbourne's home of variety, presenting both local and international performers. During the 1950s there were various pantomimes in the summer holidays including Goodie Two Shoes with Max Reddy as the Dame. Closure Following the introduction of television in Australia in 1956, audience numbers at cinemas and theatres began to dwindle. The Tivoli was hit especially hard, as many of its variety performers left the theatre to appear in the new medium. The Tivoli eventually closed on 2 April 1966, with the proceedings telecast nationally. The theatre survived as a cinema for another few months, before being gutted by fire. The building was demolished to make way for new offices and shops. Legacy The legacy of the Tivoli continues through a generation of performers who 'cut their teeth' on the Tivoli stage; and through Melbourne's theatre restaurants which were borne from the Tivoli tradition. Tivoli-style performances continued for a time at the Lido nightclub, and at Tikki and John's.

Life Mary-Cooke Branch was a native of Richmond, Virginia; she was the youngest daughter of James Read Branch and Martha Louise Patterson Branch. Her family, of English extraction, was prominent in local affairs; her grandfather, Thomas Branch, had served in the Confederate Congress, and nephews included the writer James Branch Cabell and the Episcopal preacher Walter Russell Bowie. Her father drowned accidentally three years after her birth in a bridge collapse on the way to a Republican rally. She grew up in a rich family, but from a young age she became interested in social welfare issues, a passion which was only intensified after her marriage, on November 22, 1893, to Beverley Bland Munford, a lawyer who also was active in social issues. With him she would go on to have two children, Mary Safford in 1895 and Beverley Bland in 1899. In the 1890s she also founded a Saturday Afternoon Club, whose weekly meetings attracted women from the upper echelons of Richmond society. Once she saw that their interest was in discussing refined topics rather than problems of civic life she pulled back her involvement. =Educational reform= Education reform was an area of especial interest to Munford, and one to which she devoted much focus over her life. She held various positions of leadership in the Cooperative Education Association of Virginia, founded in 1903, and was one of five women involved in the foundation of the Richmond Education Association, which began life in 1901. She promoted public education, which at the time received scant attention and funding across most of Virginia. The Richmond group was an offshoot of a national organization, and focused mainly on rural parts of the state. At its yearly conferences, members would often tour African-American educational institutions in the Southern United States, such as the Hampton Institute. Munford had been educated in both Richmond and New York, but regretted the fact that she had not been permitted to attend college despite her deep desire. Consequently, she worked to improve access to higher education for women. She attempted, via the Co-ordinate College League, to found a coordinate college at the University of Virginia dedicated to the education of white women. Legislation was introduced in the Virginia General Assembly, but defeated through fierce opposition, mainly through alumni of the University, and fell two votes short in the Virginia General Assembly in 1916. A tablet at the school commemorates his efforts. Nevertheless, Munford went on to become a member of the University's Board of Visitors in 1926 – the third woman to serve in that role – and after her death a building on campus was christened in her memory. She saw greater success in convincing the College of William and Mary to open its doors to women in 1918, and in March 1920 she became the first woman to serve on that school's Board of Visitors. The same year she joined the Richmond School Board, becoming the first woman to sit on that body as well. Munford also worked to improve opportunities for teacher training in the Commonwealth. In 1931 she managed to persuade Richmond's school board to reverse its policy discriminating against married women serving as teachers in the city's schools. =Suffrage and civil rights= Besides educational organizations, Munford was a member of many other clubs and civic groups during her career. These included the Woman's Committee of the Council of National Defense, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia, the National Municipal League, the National Consumer's League, the National Child Labor Committee, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Woman's Club of Richmond, and the Virginia Agricultural Council of Safety. With the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, she began to serve on the board of the Virginia League of Women Voters, and on the local branch in Richmond as well. She was appointed to the Democratic National Committee as well, in 1920. She organized the Virginia Inter-Urban League, served on the Board of Trustees of Fisk College, and was also active as a trustee for the National Urban League. During World War I she also assisted in national defense efforts. Following her husband's death in 1910, Munford turned more of her attention to the rights of blacks. She became an advocate of interracial cooperation, taking a paternalistic attitude towards African-Americans in line with that adopted by many of her class in the South. Her father's death, during a rally supporting the right of blacks to vote, further informed her view; she felt that he had sacrificed himself to the cause, lending it an air of greater nobility. With Janie Porter Barrett, she assisted in organizing the Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls in 1915, serving on its Board of Trustees. She never directly acknowledged segregation, but nevertheless worked to provide assistance to underfunded black communities and neighborhoods in Richmond. Death and legacy Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia, U.S. Munford died in Richmond and was buried at Hollywood Cemetery, where her grave marker pays tribute to her legacy as an education reformer. Mary Munford Elementary School in the West End neighborhood of her hometown of Richmond, Virginia was named in her honor; a historical marker detailing her contributions to Virginia education currently stands in front of it. Munford Hall on the campus of the University of Virginia was the school's first female dorm, and today houses a portion of the International Residential College; a former residence hall at William and Mary bears her name as well. Her papers are currently held by the Library of Virginia.

Vasilievsky AM The point of all life It was moved to Kursk in June 1924, and in 1937 to Voronezh. In September 1939, the corps fought in the Soviet invasion of Poland, occupying what is now western Belarus. From December 1939 to March 1940, the corps participated in the Winter War, fighting as part of the 7th Army in the western part of the Karelian Isthmus. After the Winter War ended, the 10th Rifle Corps was relocated back to Krasnoye Urochishche near Minsk in the Belorussian Special Military District. In June, the corps participated in the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, where it was initially headquartered at Šiauliai as part of the Baltic Special Military District from July, moving to Telšiai in August. The First Formation was part of the operational army during World War II from June 22, 1941 to September 7, 1941.  Cross-border fighting in Lithuania and Latvia (1941)  On June 22, 1941, when the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, began, the corps and its headquarters was stationed in Varniai (Lithuania). It comprised the 10th, 48th and 90th Rifle Divisions,David Glantz (1998), 'Stumbling Colossus – The Red Army on the Eve of World War', Kansas. (pg. 261) under Major General Ivan Nikolaev. On the right-flank of the corps, the 10th Rifle Division held positions on the border from Palanga to Shvekshny to the right of the 67th Rifle Division of the 27th Army. On its left, the 90th Rifle Division defended a line 30 kilometers wide, extending south to a junction with troops of the 125th Rifle Division of the 11th Rifle Corps. The 48th Rifle Division was still moving up and had not yet reached the border. The corps numbered 25,480 men, 453 guns and mortars and 12 light tanks. Opposing the corps and larger Soviet forces were the German I Army Corps, XXVI Army Corps and XXXVIII Army Corps, and on the left wing – the tanks of the XXXXI Motorized Corps. When the invasion began, German troops struck two major blows to the 10th's flanks: the first by the 291st Infantry Division, advancing from Memel to Kretinga and Palanga, and the second – by the XXXXI Motorized Corps on its junction with the 125th Rifle Division of the 11th Rifle Corps. The Soviet forces holding the attack's point of impact were quickly broken and part of the body in the early hours of the war was cut off from the north of the 67th Rifle Division, and the south of the 125th Rifle Division, and under the pressure of German troops began to retreat in the direction of Jelgava. Actually, he turned out to be dissected body – on June 23, 1941 the gap between the 10th and 90th Rifle Division reached 20 kilometers. South of the 90th Division the enemy troops rushed to the Siauliai. Since the band steps troops shell pressure slightly decreased, part of the body, or rather what was left of them, to June 26, 1941 a relatively orderly moved to line Mazeikiai – Kurtuvenyay and then on Riga. By that time, the 90th Rifle Division had virtually ceased to exist and in Riga the 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD was added to the corps. Within three days of the case were fighting for Riga, but July 1, 1941 finally left the city. Its next major engagement was the Tallinn frontline defensive operation (1941). The corps' headquarters was disbanded on September 14. The corps was destroyed in the early fighting of Operation Barbarossa but reformed twice.

Originating from a tropical disturbance near Guam on September 2, Etau was first classified a tropical depression on September 5\\\\. Tracking generally north, the cyclone gradually intensified and reached its peak strength with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) on September 8\\\\. The following day, Etau made landfall in Honshu, Japan. It subsequently transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day over the Sea of Japan. Record-breaking rains fell across Ibaraki and Tochigi prefectures, triggering destructive floods. Evacuation orders were issued to approximately 2.8 million people. Levee breaches took place along multiple rivers, most notably the Kinugawa which subsequently inundated the city of Jōsō. Eight people were killed across eastern Japan and total damage amounted to ¥294 billion (US$2.44 billion). Meteorological history During September 5, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to monitor a tropical disturbance, that had developed within a marginal environment for further development to the northwest of Guam. At this time the system was broad, weak and unorganized with deep atmospheric convection displaced over the north-western quadrant. Over the next day the disturbance moved north- westwards, as its low level circulation developed further and started to consolidate. During September 6, the system was classified as Tropical Depression 18W by the JTWC and as Tropical Storm Etau by the JMA.https://www.webcitation.org/6bLo50v8Q?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/WTPN32-PGTW_201509062100.htmhttps://www.webcitation.org/6bLniaE0s?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/WTPQ21-RJTD_201509061800.htm However, during Etau's post storm analysis, the JMA announced that the system had only developed into a tropical storm during September 7. Formative bands wrapped around its ragged and ill-defined LLCC. Satellite image revealed that Etau had convection increasing near its center, therefore, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm. The system later reached its peak intensity as a severe tropical storm on September 8 with maximum sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). Some weakening took place before the system made landfall over Chita Peninsula, Aichi, in the Chūbu region of Japan, early on September 9\\\\. Transition into an extratropical cyclone ensued as Etau became embedded within a frontal boundary. This process completed later that day as Etau emerged over the Sea of Japan. The extratropical remnants of Etau later interacted with and was absorbed by another but larger extratropical system which were the remnants of Typhoon Kilo on September 11. Impact =Japan= Etau as an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan on September 10 with a frontal boundary extending from the cyclone across eastern Honshu. Severe Tropical Storm Kilo can be seen to the southeast of Ex-Etau. Record rains fell across many areas in eastern Japan, with more than reported in much of eastern Honshu. The JMA director, Takuya Deshimaru, called the event \\"unprecedented\\". The heaviest rains fell across Tochigi Prefecture where was observed in Nikkō, including in 24 hours. Kanuma saw during 24 hours, more than double its previous record. Farther north in Sendai, of rain was observed. Toba, Mie saw in an hour. Fukushima Prefecture saw its heaviest rains in 50 years, with more than observed during a 48‑hour span. The extreme rains prompted multiple emergency warnings from the JMA and Takuya Deshimaru stated that the situation posed \\"grave danger\\" to residents. An emergency rainfall warning was issued for Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures on September 10 and for Miyagi Prefecture on September 11. More than 90,000 people were placed under mandatory evacuation orders A further 700,000 people were advised to evacuate as of the morning of September 11, including 410,000 in Sendai, Miyagi. At the height of the storm, 600,000 people were advised to relocate across Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture. Overall, approximately 2.8 million people were advised to evacuate, with 183,500 people under mandatory orders. The heavy rains triggered widespread flooding, with multiple rivers over-topping their banks. A section of a levee along the Kinugawa River in Ibaraki collapsed shortly after noon local time on September 10, inundating the nearby city of Jōsō. An evacuation order was not issued for Jōsō until the levee was already breached; Mayor Toru Takasugi later issued a public apology for the delayed warning. This was the first time the river broke its banks in 66 years. A 40 km2 (15 mi2) area with an estimated 6,500 homes and businesses was affected. Residents were left stranded on rooftops, with 880 still in need of rescue by the morning of September 11. Two people died in the city. Two other areas along the river, including Chikusei, experienced flooding. Throughout Ibaraki Prefecture, 3,089 hectares (7,633 acre) of crops were damaged with losses exceeding ¥920 million (US$7.64 million). One person died in Sakai. At least one person was killed by a landslide in Kanuma, Tochigi. Another landslide at a mine in Ashikaga killed a worker. A third death in Tochigi occurred due to flooding. Widespread flooding affected Miyagi Prefecture, especially around the town of Taiwa. A levee along the Shibui River in Ōsaki was breached, stranding 1,000 people. Two people drowned across the prefecture. A total of 4,533 hectares (11,201 acres) of farmland were submerged. Landslides and flooding in Chiba Prefecture affected 109 buildings and rendered numerous roads impassible. Significant damage took place at a fishing port in Chōshi; multiple vessels sank and driftwood cluttered the water. Agricultural losses in the prefecture reached ¥84 million (US$698,000). Drainage pumps at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which suffered critical meltdowns after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, were overwhelmed on September 9 and allowed contaminated water to flow into the Pacific Ocean. This was the seventh such incident in 2015. Flood waters swept 293 bags of radioactive waste into a nearby river, 171 of which were retrieved by September 13. More than 800 people were isolated in the mountain town of Minamiaizu after the Tateiwagawa River washed away the only highway access to the town. Damage across the Tōkai region, where Etau made landfall, was comparably light. A total of 108 homes were affected and landslides damaged multiple roads. Losses in the region reached ¥265 million (US$2.2 million). An 800-year-old tree in Tarui, Gifu, a local natural monument, was felled from a combination of saturated soil and high winds produced by Etau. =Russia= The extratropical remnants of Etau brought moderate rains to Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East on September 10\\\\. Accumulations peaked at with values over limited to coastal areas. Winds up to were observed in Vladivostok. Aftermath The Japan Self-Defense Forces dispatched helicopters to Jōsō soon after the floods, rescuing people from rooftops. More than 6,000 personnel and 51 helicopters were deployed. Rescuers were reportedly overwhelmed by the number of calls for help. A rescue attempt of a couple in Jōsō was aired live; however, the structure they were standing on collapsed and the feed was cut and their fate is currently unknown. The Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo planned to send 100 officers to Jōsō while members of the Tokyo Fire Department were deployed with a helicopter. Lingering high waters from the levee breach hampered relief efforts. Prime Minister Shinzō Abe toured Jōsō on September 12. By September 13, approximately 2,100 people from Jōsō remained in public shelters. The Japanese Red Cross provided ¥3 million (US$25,000) to relief efforts and asked the public for donations.

The film stars Kal Penn, Claudia Lee, Kenny Wormald, Miranda Rae Mayo, Luke Baines, Christy Carlson Romano, Katharine Isabelle, and Mitch Pileggi. Filming began in April 2015 in Victoria, British Columbia. It was an official selection at Toronto International Film Festival 2015 in the Midnight Madness category.\\"The Girl In The Photographs\\" , Toronto International Film Festival, retrieved 10 September 2015 The film was released on April 1, 2016 in a limited release and through video on demand, by Vertical Entertainment. The Girl in the Photographs is the last film Wes Craven produced before his death on August 30, 2015.\\"Wes Craven, Hollywood Horror Master, Dead at 76\\", The Wrap, published 30 August 2015, retrieved 10 September 2015  Plot  The film opens with two young women, Britney and Janet, exiting a movie theater and heading in opposite directions. Janet heads to her car in a dark parking lot where one other truck, a blood-red Bronco, sits. As she drives off the Bronco begins following her. As she enters her home there's a man waiting. He is wearing a mask, no shirt and he attacks her. After tying her up, he meets with the second man, along with her vehicle. All the while, they're taking pictures of her. Next, a man sits at a computer printing out a picture. Colleen is a young woman working at the local grocery store. Arriving early in the morning for work she sees a photograph stapled to the bulletin board at the front of the store. It contains a young bloodied woman, Janet, lying dead on a bed. Later that day Colleen goes to the Sheriff's Station in Spearfish and shows them the photograph. Not believing a crime took place, they tell her to sign a statement and be on her way. She points out that this picture is labeled number 7 at the bottom. In L.A., Peter Hemmings, a prior Spearfish resident and photographer, is reading an online blog about the same photographs. Assuming that the person taking the photographs is trying to create the \\"Dead Model\\" look, he decides to travel to Spearfish. Along with his assistant Chris, his girlfriend and model Rose, and two other models, Victoria and Trip, they head to Spearfish. When they arrive they meet Colleen at the local grocery store, where she works, and invite her to the house they're renting for a party. Prior to her arrival she contacts her friend Jill, to meet her at the party. Unbeknownst to her, Jill was kidnapped by the two men who kidnapped the previous girl. In a cage, a man offers her a can of cat food. Angry, she refuses the food, and he goads her into trying to take her cell phone. When she reaches for it, the second man uses a belt to choke her. The first man then uses Jill's phone to text Colleen, as Jill, that she will meet her at the party. While getting ready for the party, Colleen's boyfriend, Ben, says he wants to see her, which she refuses. After arriving at the party, Peter begins taking her photograph until she pushes him away and goes to her car. When she gets to her car she sees another photograph. The picture is of Jill, mutilated and one eyeball removed. The police arrive and say there isn't anything they can do. Arriving home, Ben is waiting and they get into an argument. When he leaves, he gets ambushed by the men and is taken. One of the men enters Colleen's apartment, unbeknownst to her, and leaves Ben's wallet behind. Later, at work, Colleen meets one of the men, Tom. After a short conversation, she is approached by Chris and Peter. Peter offers to take her to L.A. and make her a model, the star of his new ad campaign, to which she agrees. After heading home, she packs a few belongings and texts Ben that she's leaving town. When Tom checks Ben's phone, he sees the message and tells him his body will fit into two bags. At the house, Peter and Rose head to the hot tub, where they're attacked. Peter is viciously stabbed to death and Rose has her neck broken with a towel. Next, the two models are blinded by the flash of a camera and stabbed to death. In the bedroom, Colleen and Chris are talking and she decides to go to bed. Chris heads downstairs and sees the front door open. After approaching the door, he sees Rose lying on the ground, covered by a towel and dead. He runs back inside calling for Peter and tries to call 911, when the power goes out. Using the flash lens from the camera as a light, he walks around the house, but Gerry approaches from behind and stabs him in the head. Upstairs, Colleen tries to leave the room, but Tom is holding the door shut. She hides under a desk until the power comes back on. After heading downstairs she sees the bodies and the two men arranging them by the couch. Tom turns and takes her picture. He also tells her that he wants her to tie her hair up for second picture. After trying to escape, she is stopped by Gerry. In the end, we see Britney heading to work. As she's about to open the store, she sees a photograph on the front door. Chris, Peter, Rose, Ben, Victoria and Trip are all posed, while Colleen is sitting in the middle with her hair tied up.

The ingredients are mixed until it becomes spreadable on a sandwich. In countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, it is a common alternative to nut butter and chocolate spreads. The most common brand name is Lotus Bakeries.  History  In 2007, two individual inventors took part in a Belgian TV inventor show, called De Bedenkers (\\"The Inventors\\"), with competing recipes for a similar product: to make a spreadable product out of Speculoos cookies. Chef Danny De Maeyer had already filed a patent at that time, but didn't make it very far. His competitor Els Scheppers made it into the semi-finals with hers. Lotus, the biggest brand of Speculoos (known as Biscoff in the US) cookies, bought her idea and produced it to market. They also bought De Maeyer's patent in 2009, so as to seal the market. On January 20, 2011, a court of commerce in Ghent, Belgium, denied the patent because the recipe had already been published on a Dutch website prior to its production. Today, with the monopoly lifted, cookie butter is available under many brands. Lotus Biscoff is still the most common name, however.  In the United States  Commercially available Speculoos cookie butter The spread gained a cult following in the United States in 2015. It is often served during holidays. Lotus Biscoff Cookie Butter is the most recognizable brand. However, Trader Joe's Speculoos Cookie Butter is quite popular as well. In Scandinavia In Scandinavia, a different kind of cookie butter has been used to make confectionery cakes for many years. It usually has a very thick consistency and is flavoured with cocoa and liquor. In Sweden, cookie butter is the main ingredient in Dammsugare (Punsch-rolls). The buttery paste is flavoured with cocoa and punsch, wrapped in a thin sheet of marzipan and dipped in dark chocolate. The marzipan is usually coloured brightly green. In Denmark, cookie butter is known as trøffel-masse and is used for many traditional confectionery cakes such as studenterbrød, romkugler (known as trøfler in some parts of the country) and træstammer (a bit similar to the Swedish dammsugare) on sale in most bakeries. The cookie butter is mostly flavoured with cocoa and often includes other types of crumbled cakes. It is sometimes mixed with shredded coconut, rolled oats or jams. For the jam, apricot or raspberry is the preferred ingredient. File:Dammsugare (cropped).JPGDamsugare (Sweden). Cookie butter wrapped in brightly green marzipan and dipped in dark chocolate.

It specialises in preserving the Redlands' social history from 1842 to the present day. With over 14,000 items on display and in storage, the Museum regards itself as among the best in Queensland. Along with the large main building in Cleveland, Redland Museum operates a historical reference library, the adjacent functional blacksmith's shop, and a small outpost on nearby Russell Island. History Originating as a project of the Rotary Club of Cleveland in 1968, the Museum building was quickly constructed, opening to the public in 1970. It was soon dedicated to the people of the Redlands. As the Museum increased its collection size and popularity, largely due to the efforts of local volunteers, it outgrew the original building. This led to major expansions after 2009, allowing for more items to be displayed. Collection Much of the Redland Museum's collection consists of donations from local residents, all of which are processed and catalogued by Museum volunteers. The items mostly reflect the Redlands' colonial and agricultural history, due to the region's historical value for farming and fishing, although several items originated from elsewhere in South East Queensland. Among the most popular objects in the Collection are: *A restored Ford Model TT truck, originally purchased by a Mount Cotton farmer, with its wooden frame built by a local coachbuilder *A functional player piano *An original Halladay windpump used in a Cleveland farm *An 1860s wedding gown, worn at a wedding in Toowoomba *A manual pill-making machine used in a nearby pharmacy *A Magneto telephone switchboard from Kingsthorpe *A large patchwork quilt representing the Redlands' international diversity Displays and exhibitions The Museum houses many permanent displays, featuring, respectively: farm equipment (Dan Holzapfel Farm Pavilion); post office materials; bedroom furnishings; dolls; textiles; and varying items and texts of particularly local historical importance (Stories of the Redlands). A series of constantly-changing exhibitions are also run by the Museum. Exhibits of: writing (including a 1716 King James Bible); mannequins; bicycles; a Reedy River performance; wall- length murals; culture-fusing artistic displays; Queensland history; and Australian Aboriginal culture are among past highlights. =Australian Toy Hall of Fame= As the newest permanent display, the Australian Toy Hall of Fame intends to commemorate the toys that have been iconic to Australia throughout its history.

It was released on 24 March 2015 on Night Slugs, to positive reviews. Background Inspired by the 2011 England riots and the work of bell hooks, Dream a Garden further develops the socio-political conscience of its predecessor, engaging particularly with the effects of neoliberalism. Latham has stated that the album \\"is about the personal effects of living under capitalism. Why do I feel shit and why do the people I love feel shit when they look at billboards? It was a process of trying to work through those feelings, that culture – what society values that makes you feel like you don’t measure up.” The first single from the album, \\"Unhappy\\", critiques corruptive elements of online porn. The album largely abandons the stark, club-based sound of Latham's debut in favor of a warmer sonic palette characterized by \\"fuzzed-out beats and washes of reverb-drenched and processed guitar.\\" Latham has described the sound as \\"not a total break from the world of Classical Curves, but rather an inversion,\\" explaining that \\"Classical Curves is the surface, Dream a Garden is the exhaustion, frustration, anger, and dizziness underneath. Describing the development of Latham's sound for Clash Music, Will Salmon wrote that \\"this is still angular, defiantly awkward music, but the diamond-hard production has been replaced with something woozier and stranger. The synths have warped and melted, the beats – when they're there at all – are muffled and subdued.\\" Regarding his decision to sing, Latham stated, “I pushed up against the point where I had to sing. You have to say it and be obvious about it sometimes.\\" Critical reception Dream a Garden received generally positive reviews from critics. The Guardian described the album as \\"strange and disorientating, idiosyncratic and frequently astonishing, a modern-day psychedelia that owes almost nothing to that genre’s hackneyed conventions and never forgets to temper the sublimity with darkness\\". Writing for Clash Music, Will Salmon described the album as \\"optimistic, romantic and frequently lovely record – a startling and deliberate contrast to its predecessor,\\" and wrote that \\"the garden in this dream is a place of respite from the frightening truths of our increasingly dystopian, poverty-stricken reality.\\" Despite a relatively positive review, The Wire opined that \\"Dream a Garden only starts to sound radical when it breaks the bounds of its songforms and an eerie melancholy steals in.\\"Metacritic The Observer described the album as \\"a slow, fragmentary work taking cues from drone and post-punk, with Latham’s vocals half-buried in layers of sound,\\" writing that it \\"aims to create friction, to disrupt the party, even if it doesn’t force its message down your throat.\\"The Observer Track listing All songs written by Jam City.

It has been dated indirectly, based on the radiocarbon date of a carbonate nodule found in stratigraphic proximity, at 13,500 years old.\\"A radiocarbon date on a carbonate nodule at 3.4 m provided a date of 11,650±100 BP (Elkin 1978: 116) which now calibrates to 13,539±157 calBP\\". History The Talgai Skull was discovered in 1886 on Talgai Homestead, as the first fossil evidence of early human occupation in the area. It was found by fencing contractor, William Naish. It had been embedded in the wall of Dalrymple Creek, which had been scoured out by heavy rain. In 1896 the skull was sent to Sydney where it was examined by the trustees of the Australian Museum. The museum was interested in purchasing the fossil but could not agree on an acceptable price. Eventually the skull was returned to its owner.Allen (2010) It remained at the homestead until 1914 when Professor Edgeworth David, Professor of Archaeology at Sydney University visited Talgai and presented a theory that the skull was 20,000 years old and provided a \\"missing link\\" in the evolutionary chain. This sudden change in attitude towards the skull was motivated in part by the recent \\"discovery\\" of the Piltdown man fossils in England. Although later proven to be hoax, the Piltdown find encouraged others to search for similar evidence of early man. CSIRO and the Queensland Museum conducted archaeological surveys at the site. Severe cracks in the skull led some observers to conclude that a blow to the head had been the cause of death. However, later investigation showed that the cracks were produced by expansion and contraction of the clay soil where the skull was found. The original skull is housed at the Sydney Museum. In 1968 the Australian Broadcasting Commission made an award-winning documentary about the skull called The Talgai Skull.

They settled in the small town of Skive on the west coast of Jutland. He later moved to Aarhus, before moving to England in 1995 to attend university. Here he completed a degree in political science (BA) at Sheffield University and an MA in International Relations at the University of Essex. His first job was as a political analyst at a small firm in Cambridge that specialized in country risk analysis. In 2001, he joined Jane's Information Group in their central office in Soho London.

Vatanka has not usually been targeted by the hawkish state-run media in Iran but his writings on the Iranian Green opposition movement in 2009-2010 led to some personal attacks by hardliners in Tehran, including by Kayhan, the top state-run newspaper, which at one point accused him of being a collaborator with Western intelligence services.http://kayhanarch.kayhan.ir/900711/2.htm = Concentration(s) = With Iran's geopolitical strategies in the region in the recent decades, Vatanka was asked to testify before House Committee on Foreign Affairs - Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia, regarding \\"Iranian influence in Southern Caucasus and the Surrounding Region.\\"http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?310544-Testimony-by- Alex-Vatanka-House-Foreign-Affairs-Subcommittee-on-Eur He described the unfolding of events in the Caucasus and made the following conclusion at the hearing: > \\"Iran's influence in the South Caucasus does not match its proximity or > historical ties to the region.

The Political Security Directorate is one of these agencies and is under the guidance of the Ministry of Interior. The Directorate operates independently and generally outside the control of the legal system to repress internal dissent and monitor individual citizens. Syria has been an INTERPOL member since 1953.http://inpublicsafety.com/2017/05/how-syrians-are-using- cyber-community-policing-to-fight-terrorism/ Since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, much of Syria has been outside the control of the Syrian government. Currently, the Asayish are responsible for policing in Rojava, the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Police in areas under the Turkish occupation of northern Syria, and various Syrian opposition groups around Idlib Syrian riot police in central Damascus. The Ministry of Interior controls the Internal Security Forces. There are also other specialized organizations, such as the special metropolitan police in Damascus (overseen by the Director General of the Public Security and Police), the Gendarmerie for control in rural areas and the Desert Guard for border control (especially the Syria-Iraq border). General Nasser Deeb is the head of the Criminal Security Directorate. The Internal Security Forces Day is on 29 May, the anniversary of French forces shelling the Parliament building in Damascus in 1945.  History  General Hrant Maloyan. He was essential in the establishment of the Syrian law enforcement system. Police history in Syria dates back to the French Mandate, when General Pierre Rondot established a Gendarmerie in order to maintain law and order in rural areas; led by General Wahid Bey, it was poorly armed, organized, disciplined and equipped and did not prove very effective against rebel forces, despite several attempts to ameliorate at least discipline and morale. = From 1940s to 1950s: Independence and development = During the second half of 1944, France transferred most of the directorates of the Common Interests to the national governments, except the Levantine Special Forces and the police. To both the Lebanese and the Syrians, and to the Syrians in particular, the transfer of the army and police was of utmost importance; after several months of tense confrontation with the Syrian and Lebanese establishment, by July 1945 France had agreed to transfer control of the Levantine Special Forces. As with the Levantine Special Forces, French officers held the top posts in the security establishment, but as Syrian independence approached, the ranks below major were gradually filled by Syrian officers. By the end of 1945, the gendarmerie numbered some 3,500. At the dawn of the independent era of the Syrian Republic, of around 15,000 troops under French control, some 5,000 would be converted into the Syrian Army of one brigade with auxiliary services; equal number would be taken into the Gendarmerie; half of remaining third would be needed for police and frontier customs control; remainder would be pensioned off. Several British officers were detailed as “training team” to assist the Syrian Gendarmerie. Since independence, Syria's police and internal security apparatus have undergone repeated reorganization and personnel changes, reflecting the security demands of each succeeding regime. In 1945, Armenian general Hrant Maloyan was appointed by president Shukri al-Quwatli as the General Command of the Internal Security Forces in Syria and served this position until 1949. Maloyan would eventually be known to modernize the Syrian police ranks and improve discipline; members of the Gendarmerie doubled to 9,751 members by the time his post finished in 1949. On the wake of 1946, the Syrian Gendarmerie was considered the only reliable and effective support of the Government; it was purged and, once equipped by the United Kingdom with modern weaponry, it was successfully deployed to quell a revolt of Alawi religious leader Salman al- Murshid. In late 1940s, the national police force, grown out of the Gendarmerie, was deemed understaffed and poorly disciplined, with several cases of corruption among its ranks. Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli favoured the Gendarmerie over the French-inherited Army, fearing the military might against his own patronage network. While continuing discipline-improving efforts, in 1949 President Husni al-Za'im seized power and reformed the security apparatus, transferring the Gendarmerie from the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of Defence; the director-general of police was Adib Shishakli, who in turn took the power in 1953. The reformed security apparatus cooperated with United States officials against drug trafficking in mid-1950s. As Syrian ruler, Shishakli retrained, reequipped, and expanded Syrian armed forces, police, and security services; the Director General of Police and Public Security was at the time Ibrahim al-Husseini. Until early 1960s, the Syrian government sought the support also from former German officers for both the Army and the police forces: President of Syria Husni al-Za'im recruited military officers and police specialists. According to CIA records, two Nazi officials, Alois Brunner and Franz Rademacher, as soon as 1957 were granted asylum in Syria and advised Syrian police until the early next decade. As of late 1950s, Syrian non-military internal security forces totalled about 5,000 personnel, including a National Gendarmérie of 2,800, a Desert Patrol of 400 and 1,800 uniformed police, under the authority of the Ministry of Interior. Both the gendarmérie and police were deployed in strategically important posts throughout the country. One desert patrol company was located in Central Syria and the other in Eastern Syria. The standard of training was deemed as being very low. In addition to the uniformed police, the police services included the Sûreté, a plain-clothes service of about 300 men. At the time, the United States Department of State deemed the non-military security forces to be unable to restrict the Communist action; nevertheless, due to the strength of political forces deemed as leftist (Communist and Ba'ath parties), the U.S. Department of State adopted a policy of avoiding to take actions aimed strengthen Syrian internal security forces. = 1960s: United Arab Republic and Ba'ath coups = Under the United Arab Republic, Syrian Minister of Interior Colonel Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj regained control over Syrian gendarmerie and the desert patrol; the Gendarmerie, the Desert Patrol and the Department of General Security (under military control) and the police (under the Ministry of Interior) were merged in the overall organization, called Police and Security, on 13 March 1958; the organization was placed under al- Sarraj's Ministry of Interior. Syrian police higher post were taken over by Egyptians even if three of the four intelligence networks operating in Syria were under Syrian direction; the other was attached to the President’s Office in Cairo. In each Governorate, a Major General of Police was appointed to the influential position of Director of Security. Back to the regained independence in 1961, Adnan Quwatli, a professor of Law linked to business community, was appointed Interior Minister; on 15 December 1961 Colonel Muhammad Hisham al-Samman was appointed Commander of Internal Security Forces, assisted by a Committee under his presidency and including the Directors- General of Police and Public Security and six provincial superintendents. The Kuzbari government pledeged to establish political liberties and to disestablish emergency laws; despite this, the civil police forces are believed to have been used extensively to combat internal security threats to the government, including pro-Nasserites Baathists and other secular socialists (opposed to the business-Islamist alliance), especially in the universities, which were subjected to several forms of control; also trade unions were harshly confronted by the police in 1962. With the 1963 Syrian coup d'état, Amin al-Hafiz was appointed Ministry of Interior under Salah al- Bitar and Naji Jamil became the head of Military Police (until 1966), and in 1964 large-scale riots erupted in Hama, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s disturbances erupted over the secular constitution. With the Legislative Decree No. 67, issued on 24 March 1965, the police received the title of Internal Security Forces; according to the law the ISF were part of the armed forces, linked to the Minister of Interior, and specialized business and the tasks entrusted to them according to the regulations in force. The law granted the same status of the Syrian Arab Army and his men to the Internal Security Forces. In 1966, as a result of the Syrian Regional Ba’ath Party’s coup, Abd al-Karim al-Jundi assumed the leadership of the security apparatuses as head of the National Security Bureau of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region. During the subsequent decades, however, police forces assumed a more conventional civil police role; this change in role coincided with increased professionalization and the parallel development of an effective and pervasive internal security apparatus. Nevertheless, the police continued to receive training in such functions as crowd and riot control. = From 1970s to 1980s: Islamist insurgency = During the relative political stability of the 1970s and 1980s, police and security services were credited with having grown and become professional; however, they remained highly secretive, and in 1987 only the bare outlines of their institutional makeup were known. With the success of Hafez al-Assad'a Corrective Movement in November 1970, a partial reform of the law enforcement was carried out, with some crimes dealt with by the police instead of the Army; with the 1970s state building process, the local security chiefs gained more prominence, with the whole security apparatus being seen as the Regime «bedrock». According to Alasdair Drysdale, the Hafiz al-Asad's rule was characterized by a marked increase of the Alawite presence in key posts in the officer corps, in the internal security forces and in the Ba'ath Party, possibly also due to the Islamist unrest. During the 1980s, the internal security apparatus was under the command of Rifaat al-Assad, brother of President Hafez al-Assad. During the unrest caused by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1976, the Internal Security Forces were heavily employed in the northern- central region, in Aleppo, Hama and Homs. During 1970s, Ali Haydar's Special Forces formed a key part of the Syrian government's security apparatus; they participated to the quelling of the Islamist uprising in Jisr al-Shughur in March 1980 and in Hama in February 1982. According to John Andrade, in the mid-1980s the Public Security Police, a national police force, was responsible for routine police duties, although it was confronted by the insurgents in the 1982 Islamist uprising in Syria and held isolated skirmishes in Aleppo and in Latakia. Damascus had a metropolitan police force, which, like theprovincialforces, was subordinated to the national command. The Police was subdivided into four main services: Administration, Criminal Investigations, Public Order and Traffic departments which also dealt with internal security matters. The police system incorporated the 8,000-man Gendarmerie, which had originally been organized by the French Mandate authorities to police rural areas, and the 1800-man Desert Guard in charge for desert borders. As of late 1980s, the internal security forces were given a high status: typically, provincial police chiefs were member of the relevant Ba'ath Party provincial command. = From 1990s to 2000s: Confrontation with Kurds and Islamists and reform of the security sector = Starting from the 1990s, the Syrian security sector underwent a series of reform, which were part, from mid-2000s, of a broader-range reform process. As of 2016, some 1993 estimates put the Gendarmerie as still being in force within the Internal Security Forces and being 8,000-men strong. In 1996 the Government of Syria reformed police and established the Anti-Narcotics Division. In 2002, Syria elevated the Anti- Narcotics unit from a branch to a separate Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior. The Economic Security Courts, established under the 1970 emergency laws and tasked with dealing with economic crimes, were disestablished in February 2004. In late 2000s, training programmes focusing on human rights were launched. According to American professor Joshua Landis, the Internal Security Forces in mid-2000s altered their own ethnic/religious composition, under the guidance of then-Minister of Interior Ghazi Kanaan. This alteration was reportedly carried out in order to make the national police (subject to the law) reliable to step in dealing with national security issues, thus diminishing the extra-law Syrian intelligence community's role, as part of broader reforms of the same years. The decision reportedly caused criticism by Sunni Arab officials. Nevertheless, the police devoted to general duties was poorly equipped: according to the United Kingdom Home Office, as of 2009 there were few police checkpoints on main roads or in populated areas. In mid-2000s Syrian police was involved in operations against Islamist militants, across the decade. Also the Military Police was involved in confrontations against Islamist militants detained in Syrian prisons. During the same period the Syrian police confronted also against Kurds and dealt with Kurdish demonstrations; clashes and shoot-outs were a not so uncommon occurrence throughout the decade. In mid-2000s, the main agency was still known to the 2006 edition of the World Encyclopedia of Police Forces and Correctional Systems as the Public Security Police, operating under the Ministry of the Interior. Alongside the Public Security Police, whose headquarters maintained the subdivision into the four main branches, two paramilitary forces operated: the Gendarmerie and the Desert Guard. With regard to the ancillary law enforcement and security organizations, in 2003 Anthony Cordesman put the Gendarmes number at 8,000. On the other hand, according to Jane‘s Assessment, cited by 2012 U.K. Country of Origin Information report, as of 2006 the number of border guards deployed was increased to about 10,000. On the international front, late 2000s were marked by an intensive cooperation with INTERPOL on terrorism issues. = 2011 onwards: Syrian Civil War = At the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, the Syrian security apparatus appeared, to Middle East scholar Professor Joshua Landis, a cohesive group, without significant dissertion problems; Syrian police was in charge of quelling demonstrations and they exercised violence against demonstrators; some sources claim that often the police violence was a reaction against violent opponents. According to government lists presented to and published by the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, in 2011 the death toll for Syrian police forces was 478. According to U.S. government-funded Radio Farda, the Iranian police forces, along with Quds force units, supported the suppression of early protests in 2011. During the following phases of the Civil War, also regular police units were deployed on the front lines. According to Fars News Agency, in 2016 Iranian police commander, Brigadier General Hossein Ashtari, said that Iran was ready to offer support in police training. Following the conquest of Aleppo by the Syrian Government, the Russian news agency Interfax reported that a Russian Military Police battalion arrived in Aleppo in order to support the law enforcement and to secure the peace commission, as well as, according to the pro-Russian Sputnik news agency, to train local personnel. As consequence of the establishment of the De-escalation zones, some Russian sources reported that the Russian Federation deployed four Military Police battalions in order to garrison such areas. The MP units form the core of specific units with specific non-combat control tasks, such as, according to Gulf News, the manning of checkpoints and observation posts. In 2018, with the recovery of several areas by the Government, the Internal Security Forces were gradually redeployed in re- gained regions: Hama and Homs countryside, Damascus region. In particular, after the Syrian Government assumed complete control of the Damascus region with the capture of the Yarmouk Camp in May 2018, the Internal Security Forces deployed in al-Hajar al-Aswad district and Yarmouk Camp and held a parade there alongside the Army. Following the deepening of the civil war, police forces have been established also by insurgent factions, as well as by Rojava Kurdish-held region and, on 24 January 2017, a Syrian security force was established by Turkey in Turkey-controlled Syrian border town Jarablus; a video reportedly showing ranks and files of armed men chanting Islamist and pro-Turkey slogans was released on YouTube.  Police system  A Syrian police car bonnet, showing the official emblem. According to the official website of the Ministry of Interior, its task are limited to the protection and enforcement of security. Alongside with other Directorates, the Ministry of Interior controls the Internal Security Forces, through the Criminal Security Directorate, which are organised into at four separate divisions of police forces under a Director General: Administrative Police, Traffic Police (whose official Day is on 4 May), Criminal Investigations, and Riot police, as well as a fanfare and the Khan al-Asal Police Academy. The Internal Security Forces are part of the Ministry of Interior but makes uses of military ranks. Also specialist organizations exist. = Personnel = As for total manpower of the Syrian police, in 2011 reportedly were about 100,000 police plus reserves, while 2016 estimates put the total force of 28,000 personnel, and 8,000 to 9,000 injured soldiers. Syrian women are allowed to serve (although not in frontline units) and to reach senior positions. = Operating methods = The police reportedly undergo military-type and counter-terrorism training. Community policing is also a large element within the country of Syria. Citizens in Syria began using cyber community policing tactics via social media as a way to address the conflict happening around them. Doing so has given them some power to influence change in their environment. Their efforts demonstrate that global cyber community policing programs have the ability to connect communities and create social media networks that can effectively and proactively address, and hopefully prevent, threats to its citizens.http://inpublicsafety.com/2017/05/how-syrians-are-using-cyber- community-policing-to-fight-terrorism/ = Training = The police reportedly undergo military-type and counter-terrorism training, having a school in al- Hasakah. Education for all police personnel is provided at three institutes: two central Police Training Schools in Damascus and Aleppo and the Officers College in Homs, where junior officers are sent for six-month courses in specialized areas of expertise.  Criminal Security Directorate  Within the Criminal Security Directorate there are five Divisions and branches: * The Administrative Police is also known as Neighbourhood Police: they are responsible for general security and deal with non-emergency situations. * The Emergency Division deals with emergency situations, operating roving patrols. The emergency number is 112. * Criminal Security Department; * Riot Division; * Electronic Criminal Branch, in charge of combating computer- and web-based crime. According to pro-government newspaper Al-Watan, the Electronic Criminal Branch has a dedicated criminal laboratory. At the central level, the Directorate is the body in charge for relationships with INTERPOL and also has an its own Commission for combating money laundering in cooperation with the Commission of the same name at the Central Bank of Syria. Since 8 July 2019, the head of the Criminal Security Directorate is General Nasser Deeb, considered closely linked with Russia,, former head of the Hama branch of the Political Securiti Directorate and former assistant director of the Damascus branch. = Criminal Security Department = The Criminal Security Department is the subdivision of the Criminal Security Directorate which is in charge for general investigative police duties. Police records in Syria are maintained by the Ministry of Interior, Criminal Security Department and separate records are maintained by each jurisdiction: some jurisdictions are computerized, but there is no central computerized database. As of 2016, the director of the Criminal Security Department is General Natham al-Housh. Within the Criminal Security there is a subdivision known as the “Department of Protection of Public Moralities\\", tasked with investigating suspect homosexuals and their activities. = Riot police = The Riot police ( Qiwa Hafz al-Nizam) is part of the Criminal Security Directorate. The riot police core missions are to provide tactical security, crowd control and riot control for demonstrations. In Damascus, the riot police is also used in order to protect diplomatic missions against protestors. Riot Police is organized into Battalions and Brigades. During the Syrian civil war, the riot police has been used in order to break early protests; according to pro-opposition opinionists, it even opened fire on demonstrators. Syrian riot police is issued typical riot equipment, such as riot helmets, shields and rubber batons. Other heavier equipment includes armoured personnel carriers, water cannons and tear gas. According to pro-U.S. sources, anti-riot equipment was also issued by the Iranian police. The riot police is also reportedly equipped with armoured vehicles. Policemen assigned to security and riot control duty wear the military olive green with garrison caps, but also camouflage. = Territorial organization = At territorial level, the Syrian police is organized into Police Provincial Commands, each led by a Major General, who is assisted by a Brigadier General acting as a deputy. The Operations Department is directed by another Brigadier General. Districts are headed by Directors ranking Colonel to Brigadier General, while Subdistricts are led by junior Officers. As of May 2018, the Commander of Damascus region is Major General Issam Shehadeh al- Hallaj.  Anti-Narcotics Directorate  The Anti-Narcotics Directorate, independent from the Criminal Security Directorate since 1996, has responsibility for anti-drug law enforcement and intelligence gathering. The anti-narcotics establishment was separated from the police in 2002 and made an independent Directorate within the Ministry of Interior. Before the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, the Government also operated regional counternarcotics offices in Aleppo province and in Homs province, with plans to open offices in the remaining provinces. The work of the Anti-Narcotics Directorate is specialised in guiding and coordinating efforts aimed at fighting the illicit traffic, plantation and use of drugs, plans the fight against drugs in coordination with other authorities, executes international anti-drugs operations, and collects information on drug crimes. As of 2006, the Anti-Narcotics Directorate was subdivided into: * Internal anti-drug division; * International anti-drug division; * Information division; * Rehabilitation and training division.  Specialist organizations  Aside of the general police, there are also other specialized organizations, such as the special metropolitan police in Damascus and the country's other major cities (overseen by the Director General of the Public Security and Police), the Gendarmerie for control in rural areas and the Desert Guard for border control (especially the Syrian-Iraqi border), up to 10,000-men strong. These latter two organizations have a military character. For ceremonial duties, the Internal Security Forces also have a cavalry battalion based in Damascus. Other elements of the internal security, albeit separated by the Internal Security Forces and by the Ministry of the Interior, are the Military Police, the Shabbiha and the People‘s Army. Loyalist and reconciled militias also provide police and security services in areas controlled by the Government of Syria. = Syrian Special Mission Forces = During the Syrian Civil War, the Ministry of Interior established a quick reaction unit, the Syrian Special Mission Forces. According to Al-Masdar News, the Special Mission Forces have been set up by Russian advisers and are mainly, although not exclusively, intended for urban security actions, as well as carrying out force protection and security operations against terrorist activities.  Police equipment  Syrian police equipment is an issue. According to The Telegraph, which cites WikiLeaks, the Syrian police was supplied with advanced radio communications equipment, including 500 hand-held VS3000 radios, by Finmeccanica as late as 2011. According to pro-opposition website Zaman al-Wasl, in 2014 the Ministry of Interior received two Russian MI-171SH helicopters. Regular police units appear to be equipped with the AKM assault rifle and the Makarov PM and Browning Hi-Power pistols. Elite police units are equipped with AK-103 and AK-104 assault rifles. = Police uniforms = Police uniforms vary according to the police branch which it is considered. Generally speaking, policemen assigned to security tasks wear the military olive green with garrison caps, but also camouflage. Since 2009, the Government has decided to change traffic policemen’s uniforms from military olive green to grey pants, a white shirt with yellow shoulder patches and black belt and shoes. As of 2011, Anti- terrorism police wore dark blue uniforms. Ceremonial uniforms consist in jackboots, white peaked cap and white tunic, with dark trousers with a red trim for infantry and motorcycle units, and white cavalry pants for mounted troopers.  Issues  According to several sources, police impunity and corruption are serious problems. In 2008, President Bashar al-Assad issued a law that mandates that only the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces may issue an arrest warrant in the case of a crime committed by a military officer, member of the internal security forces, or customs police officer in the pursuit of his normal duties, and that such cases must be tried in military courts. Arbitrary and false arrests are also problems, and detainees had no legal redress. According to the accusations, the authorities use the Emergency Law to detain persons critical of the government and charge them with a wide range of political crimes, including treason. Incommunicado detention was a severe problem. Many persons who disappeared were believed to be either in long-term detention without charge or possibly to have died while detained. Many detainees brought to trial were held incommunicado for years, and their trials were often marked by irregularities and lack of due process. A shortage of available courts and lack of legal provisions for a speedy trial or plea bargaining led to lengthy pretrial detentions. According to a 2005 Freedom House report, women are discouraged from presenting their claims in police stations, which are largely staffed by male police officers, for fear of experiencing discomfort or sexual harassment. According to the report, Syrian police officials are not sympathetic to women victims of violence. A human rights police training program funded by the Swiss and Norwegian governments continued throughout 2008. The Geneva Institute for Human Rights, with support from the Ministand the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, began a third training course in October.  Torture accusations  The law prohibits such practices as torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, and the penal code provides punishment of a maximum imprisonment of three years for abusers. Under article 28 of the constitution, \\"no one may be tortured physically or mentally or treated in a humiliating manner.\\" Nevertheless, security forces reportedly continued to use torture frequently. Local human rights organizations continued to cite numerous credible cases of security forces allegedly abusing and torturing prisoners and detainees and claimed that many instances of abuse went unreported. Individuals who suffered torture or beatings while detained refused to allow their names or details of their cases to be reported for fear of government reprisal. Former prisoners, detainees, and reputable local human rights groups report that methods of torture and abuse included electrical shocks; pulling out fingernails; burning genitalia; forcing objects into the rectum; beatings while the victim is suspended from the ceiling and on the soles of the feet; alternately dousing victims with freezing water and beating them in extremely cold rooms; hyper-extending the spine; bending the body into the frame of a wheel and whipping exposed body parts; using a backward-bending chair to asphyxiate the victim or fracture the spine; and stripping prisoners naked for public view. In previous years Amnesty International documented 38 types of torture and mistreatment used against detainees in the country. AI reported that torture was most likely to occur while detainees were held at one of the many detention centres operated by the various security services in the country, particularly while authorities attempted to extract a confession or information. Courts systematically used \\"confessions\\" extracted under duress as evidence, and defendants' claims of torture were almost never investigated.  Criminal procedure  Upon arrest, the individual is brought to a police station for processing and detained until a trial date is set. At the initial court hearing, which can be months or years after the arrest, the accused may retain an attorney at personal expense or be assigned a court- appointed attorney, although lawyers are not ensured access to their clients before trial. The individual is then tried in court, where a judge renders a verdict. Although the prison code provides for prompt access to family members, human rights organizations and families reported inconsistent application of the code, with some families waiting as long as a year to see relatives. Civil and criminal defendants had the right to bail hearings and possible release from detention on their own recognizance. = Military courts = Military courts have authority over cases involving soldiers or members of other military or police branches. If the charge against a soldier or member of the military or police branch is a misdemeanour, the sentence against the defendant is final. If the charge is a felony, the defendant has the right to appeal to the Military Chamber at the Court of Cassation. Military courts also have authority to try civilians in cases based on military law. Civilians have the right to appeal all sentences in military court. A military prosecutor decides the venue for a civilian defendant.  ISIL police  Between the end of 2012 and 2017, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) maintained a local police force in parts of the Raqqa and Aleppo governorates that it controlled. According to Carl Anthony Wege, ISIL seemed to keep separate local police from religious police; the religious police has a mission of promoting virtue and preventing vice, called Hisbah which included a female unit.{ The Hisbah forces were organized at battalion-level under their own Emir. Aside of Hisbah, al-Khansaa and Umm Rayhan brigades were internal security units maintaining their own morality police forces. = Ordinary police = The main official function of the ordinary police forces was to serve as the executive body for the court, but there were also road police services. Additionally, the police forces were tasked with maintaining internal security through the deployment of regular patrols inside towns. According to a well-known ISIL account, ISIL provided local police patrols with dedicated vehicles as well as branded khaki uniforms. Despite ISIL claims that its officers “do not rule on any case, but rather transfer cases to the court,” the reality is that extrajudicial detainment and torture are commonplace in ISIL-held territory. According to a report released by Amnesty International in December 2013, ISIL maintained at least seven large detention facilities throughout Raqqa and Aleppo provinces. Inside its detention centers ISIL held common criminals who have been sentenced by its judicial branch, but it also detains political opponents, activists, and even children as young as eight years old. On 28 April 2014, an activist movement in Raqqa city publicized a protest by women demanding to know the fate of their male family members, who had been detained by ISIL for some time.  SDF  Members of the Raqqa internal security forces in Ayn Issa. The Asayîş or Asayish (, Kurdish for security) is the official security organisation of the autonomous administration in Rojava (Syrian Kurdistan). It was formed during the Syrian Civil War to police areas controlled by the Kurdish Supreme Committee. On 17 May 2017, the Raqqa Internal Security Forces was established, with the support of the Self Defence Forces. The training has been provided by the international coalition against ISIS, with the first training course of 50 recruits based in Ayn Issa. The United States reportedly provided training to Raqqa security forces. The Manbij Internal Security Forces also operate as a police force. The long-term goal for the group is to train 3,000 recruits; the initial batch is intended to develop in a training cadre in order to continue training Raqqa internal security forces recruits. According to Kurdistan 24, members of the Raqqa Internal Security Forces are mainly Arabs. Northern Syria Internal Security Forces is an umbrella terms for internal security forces (minus Sutoro and the police branch of Bethnahrain Women's Protection Forces)  Free Syrian Police  The Syrian National Coalition established in 2013 a Free Syrian Police in Aleppo. The FSP was said to be underequipped and underarmed; according to British foreign secretary Philip Hammond, the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2017 worked with international donors to provide the Free Syrian Police training, technical assistance, maintenance funds, and basic equipment. Most assistance was provided through the private contractor Adam Smith International. The UK- backed Free Syrian Police force reportedly operate unarmed. According to pro- opposition sources, the label of \\"Free Syrian Police\\" does not imply an unified security organization; moreover, there is not a united judicial entity. The rebel council directing police affairs which pro-opposition sources report is planned to be formed includes the chief for Aleppo police, a director of officers affairs, a director of inspections, regulation and administrative affairs, a director of immigration and crossings, a director of public relations and media and a representative for Idlib Governorate. As of 2016, the Opposition factions have reportedly diminished the role of the Free Syrian Police in areas under their control; the Police has reportedly been limited to pursuing crimes and offences, directing traffic and other matters, excluding the Police from the security management. According to Syrian Opposition website Zaman al-Wasl, Brigadier Adeeb al-Shalaf, chief of police in rebel-held areas of the Aleppo Governorate, announced in July 2017 the start of recruitment of women, in order to deal with the female inspection activities. An investigation by the BBC program Panorama in 2017 found the Free Syrian Police to be involved in recurring human rights abuses, including executions by stoning, and collaboration with extremists such as the Nour al- Din al-Zenki Movement. After a suspension, British and other government funding resumed in early 2018.. The resumption of funding without an independent investigation was decried by Kate Osamor, shadow secretary for international development, and other aid experts. In June 2018 the British government decided, due to the changing military situation, to responsibly withdraw from funding some programmes in the area that the police operated in, such as education, livelihood support and policing. British government funding support for the Free Syrian Police ended in October 2018. On 10 January 2019, following the Idlib inter-rebel conflict, the Free Idlib Police dissolved itself and handed over assets to local councils.https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/aej0oy/free_idlib_police_dissolves_itself_and_hands_over/?st=JQQN7IPF&sh;=75e65ef4 With HTS taking over all of greater Idlib, the Free Syrian Police ceased to operate, with the only FSA area being with the SNA, which is policed by the Turkish created \\"Free Police\\". According to Abdullah Al-Jabassini for the European University Institute's Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, at least several members of the former Free Syrian Police joined the regular police. = Turkey-backed \\"Free Police\\" = A Syrian security force was established by Turkey in Turkey-controlled Syrian border town Jarablus on 24 January 2017, in order to take control of the ordinary security of Euphrates Shield areas; a video reportedly showing ranks and files of armed men chanting Islamist and pro-Turkey slogans was released on YouTube. According to Reuters, the force is referred to as the \\"Free Police\\", in reference to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) alliance, and in January 2017 consisted of 450 recruits, many of whose are former Syrian rebel fighters, who received five weeks of training in Turkey; reportedly, the force is intended to grow up to 8,000 men. As of 2017, the Turkey-backed \\"Free Police\\" is active in Azaz, Jarablus and al-Bab. According to the Syrian Opposition website Zaman Zaman al-Wasl, as of May 2017 the Turkey-backed \\"Free Police\\" in the border town of Azaz consisted of 1,600 officers. According to Zaman al-Wasl, the new police force replaced previous rebel police forces, with improvement in numbers and logistics. The Turkey- backed police reportedly lack highly ranked officers, as well as ranking criteria. The Turkey-based security force consists of regular police and special forces; the commander is General Abd al-Razaq Aslan, a defector from the Syrian army. Members of the Turkey-backed security force reportedly wear Turkish police uniforms decorated with the word \\"Polis\\" (Turkish for \\"Police\\") and Special Forces wear distinctive light blue berets, also worn by Turkish Gendarmerie. Some wore a Turkish flag patch on their uniforms at the inauguration ceremony on 24 January 2017. As of 25 October 2017, 5,600 Syrian police were trained by Turkey in Euphrates Shield area: Azaz, al-Bab and Jarabulus districts; in May 2018 they also assumed control of the Afrin area. According to Danielle Fife for the Center for Security Policy, the Turkey- backed \\"Free Police\\" is part of the Turkish efforts to counter the Kurdish expansionism, along with the Turkish Free Syrian Army. Following the Idlib inter-rebel conflict in January 2019, the Free Police became the only remaining FSA police force (as the Free Syrian Police ceased to operate).

The corridor connects Railway Square to Darling Harbour in the south and passes both the University of Technology Sydney Broadway campus and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Sydney head office. The Goods Line terminates in the north at the corner of Sussex and Hay Streets, in the Sydney central business district. Description From the southern end, the Goods Line walkway commences at the southern end of Central Station at the beginning of the Devonshire Street Tunnel. The tunnel is a pedestrian tunnel that was opened in 1906, joining Devonshire Street with Lee Street. From the exit of the tunnel one enters Henry Deane Plaza, which sits slightly below the level of Lee Street, and descends a ramp at the other end of the Plaza to enter the extension tunnel beneath Lee Street. The extension tunnel continues under Lee Street, Railway Square and George Street and, at each of these points, the extension tunnel can be exited or entered by stairs and escalators. There are no entry/exit points to the tunnel via any buildings. The extension tunnel then continues under the TAFE Marcus Clark Building and opens behind the Wembley House at 841 George Street. To the west of the end of the extension tunnel, two steel rails appear from under a pair of large gates. The gates block entry to the northern end of the Railway Square road overbridge which in the past, provided access for trains using the railway line to Darling Harbour. From this point, the Goods Line walkway makes use of the former railroad's infrastructure, including the Ultimo Road railway underbridge. The walkway exits the rail corridor near the Powerhouse Museum, crosses Darling Drive and terminates at the corner of Sussex and Hay Streets, Sydney. Background The western edge of Darling Harbour yard. The back of the Ultimo Tram Depot and tramway power station – now the Powerhouse Museum – can be seen. The Goods Line passes by the tram depot and ends at the museum. The Goods Line uses the route of a former freight railway line that connected Sydney Yard and the Sydney – Parramatta railway line to the shipping port of Darling Harbour. The railway line opened in 1855 and was extended to Dulwich Hill in 1922, providing a way for freight trains to access Darling Harbour without interfering with passenger trains.Forsyth, J.H. (ed.) (1988–93), Stations & Tracks; Vol. 1: \\"Main Suburban & Branches – Illawarra & Branches\\". State Rail Authority of New South Wales: Sydney, p. 97. A short branch from Lilyfield to Rozelle served another freight terminal. The port facilities at Darling Harbour closed down and the precinct was extensively redeveloped in the 1980s. In the following years, the Lilyfield – Sydney Yard section became disused and a light rail line opened between Pyrmont and Central station in 1997.\\"Sydney's new light rail system\\" Railway Digest September 1997 page 14 The light rail leaves the former railway corridor at Hay Street, leaving a short section of the corridor disused. The light rail line, now known as the Dulwich Hill Line and the Inner West Light Rail has been extended to Lilyfield station and then on to Dulwich Hill. The section of the former goods line corridor from the northern end of the Devonshire Street Tunnel to Ultimo Road was converted to pedestrian and was originally called the Ultimo Pedestrian Network until it was renamed The Goods Line in 2012. Plans were then announced to expand the pathway through to Hay Street. This second section opened on 30 August 2015. The adjacent Dr Chau Chak Wing Building opened earlier in 2015; an entrance to the building is provided from The Goods Line. Design The Goods Line was designed by ASPECT Studios and CHROFI. Design features include grassy lawns, dining tables, table tennis tables, study pods and a children's water play area with a sand pit. The design choices also took cues from the railways, and the designers suggested that instead of transporting materials and produce, the corridor now transports commodities of the modern economy: ideas, people, social and cultural interactions. Several rail artefacts have been preserved, including the Ultimo Road railway underbridge, built in 1879, and a lever frame from the Ultimo Street Signal Box. The design won a 2014 Australia Award for Urban Design in the Policies, Programs and Concepts – Small Scale category. Future The original section, from Railway Square to Ultimo Road, will be upgraded. Transport for NSW is conducting a feasibility study on an extension towards the disused Regent Street railway station using the rail tunnel under Railway Square.

It is a member of the order Dictyoceratida, one of two sponge orders that make up the keratose or \\"horny\\" sponges in which a mineral skeleton is absent and a skeleton of organic fibers is present instead. Description A single specimen of this species was collected in Palau and described as the holotype specimen in 1965. A more recent description based on three specimens collected near Papua New Guinea highlights prominent conules and relatively infrequent oscules. The color was reported as \\"sand\\" in the field and \\"middle brown\\" after preservation, although the color of the preserved Palau specimen was given as \\"greyish-white\\". Both descriptions emphasize the irregular, densely reticulated branch network. Fibers made of sand, spicules, and spongin are also present, and aid in distinguishing the species from relatives. Habitat D. arenaria was originally identified in the Palau Islands and specimens have since been collected from a variety of locations in the Pacific. Along with other members of the genus, D. arenaria was listed as a rare invasive species found in Hawaii in a 2008 NOAA memorandum. Secondary metabolites Numerous secondary metabolite molecules found in D. arenaria have been reported in the scientific literature, often with an interest in their bioactivity. For example, members of a class of cytotoxic molecules known as cryptophycins, originally isolated from cyanobacteria, have also been found in D. arenaria, where they were given the name arenastatins. However, since cyanobacteria are common symbionts of sponges, it has been suggested that bacteria may be the true origin in cases where sponge and bacterial metabolites closely resemble one another. A series of sesquiterpenoid hydroquinones have also been isolated from D. arenaria, among which are two unusual examples with distinctive enantiomers of their drimane molecular skeleton. A sterol isolated from the species was reported as a rare example of a molecule capable of reversing multidrug efflux-mediated fungal resistance to the drug fluconazole.

Design and development The Oeffag G was a relatively large flying boat, following the design practises used for the smaller Lohner flying boats developed in Austria contemporaneously. The aircraft was a biplane with the wings mounted above a slender all-wood monocoque fuselage/hull, with the biplane tail unit mounted above the extreme tail end of the fuselage.

Santos-Viola, the church administration had the immense house of worship built for the largest locale congregation at that time. Founding Years (1915–1967) The chapel was erected 52 years after the establishment of the original house of worship of the Locale of Tondo on Gabriela Street in 1915, which was made from nipa and bamboo. When this chapel gutted by Fire in 1926, the congregation was divided into Four Places of Worship – namely Dagupan, Raxabago, Rivera and Apitong, the latter being the original congregation which later separated, becoming the Locale of Tayuman. The Tondo Locale (1967–present) Over the years, members in the three Congregations of Tondo grew rapidly by the hundreds. By 1965, the Church Administration decided to merge these three locales to form one unified locale, which would also include those served under the Tayuman congregation from eastern parts of Tondo and central Sta. Cruz and attended services there. Thus, work began on a new chapel for the now united Tondo Congregation. After months of work, the chapel was dedicated on May 10, 1967, the 81st anniversary of the birth of the founder, Felix Manalo. Originally, it was designed to hold around 5,000 worshipers, accommodating some 3,000 people in the main hall and an additional 300 in a separate choir loft above the dais, and 2,700 in its balcony. It was renovated in 2007 to meet the new standards of the INC Construction and Engineering Department. The former cinema-style chairs in the main nave were replaced with wooden pews, and the seating capacity was increased by 1,000. The formerly-separate choir loft and dais were integrated. LED cove-lights were installed on geometrically designed ceiling. The floor was replaced with low-maintenance Granite Tiles from Italy. The former sliding main doors towards the lobby were replaced by two swing doors. The lobby was also renovated and expanded to accommodate more worshipers and guests.

They can show a process or portray an event sequence in a simplified manner. They can help students identify cause-and-effect relationships. A graphic organizer can be also known as a knowledge map, a concept map, a story map, a cognitive organizer, an advance organizer, or a concept diagram. They are used as a communication tool to employ visual symbols to express knowledge, concepts, thoughts or ideas, and the relationships between them.  Types  * Topic or knowledge maps visually depict where items of information exist. * Concept maps illustrate relationships between two or more concepts. * Story maps identify the elements of a story and the main storyline. * Webs show how information categories relate to one another. * Mind maps visually represent central ideas surrounded by connected topics and subtopics.  Teaching  When students read a text that outlines a story, process or series of events, it can be useful to put the information in a sequence. Breaking down information into sections can make it easier to understand as a whole. Moreover, large pictures help emphasize the core meaning along with practical demonstrations. A graphic organizer can be used as a teaching tool in two ways: * From graphic organizer to text – A completed sequence organizer is used to create a piece of writing based on the information it contains. * From text to graphic organizer – A sequence organizer is used to simplify, in note form, events in a sequential order. This is often used by teachers to check student's comprehension of a text. = More ideas = Students who need more help can be provided with key events already written in the left hand arrows. If students are reading different sections of the same text, such as a jigsaw activity, they should complete a particular portion of their organizer. When the classmates assemble, they can exchange their portions to make notes of important information of other sections. Organizers can be used as a platform to prepare a rough draft for a narrative text, or a summarize review of sequential information from more than one textual source or learning experience.

He displayed a keen interest in the art forms of poetry, folk arts and painting from a young age, and also in music (playing violin and lute). From 1906-10, he studied law at Lyons. From 1910 to 1914 he enrolled in art studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, Italy, the first student to do so from Egypt.

Professional life and legacy Nagy returned to Alexandria during the World War I, when he was fired by a \\"radical approach towards classic rules of art\\" and concentrated his painting on Impressionism. His paintings were a mix of Egypt’s traditional and the modern art forms. Nature was his theme, and art work on walls and permanent surfaces done by artists of Ancient Egypt enthused him. In 1939 Nagy started his ambitious project titled \\"Alexandria School\\" when he headed the Museum of Modern Art as its director. In 1952, to give shape to his project, he decided to build an atelier in a plot of land which he purchased from Hadayek al-Ahram. He pursued this project till he died in his studio in 1956.

During the Indian independence movement, she was inspired by Sarojini Naidu, a freedom fighter and participated in the street protests against the British Raj before she started her study of architecture at the Sir J. J. College of Architecture. She was involved in the conceptualization and proposal of the New Bombay plan in 1964 in collaboration with Charles Correa and Shirish Patel, which involved extension of the island city located to the east on the mainland. This plan was published in MARG, a Bombay journal of art and architecture. She, along with Minnette De Silva and Yasmeen Lari, was also actively involved in upliftment of people living in slums and in the rehabilitation of earthquake- affected people by developing low-cost housing, combined with environmental aspects and urban planning. Early life and education Mehta had her initial education at the Sir J. J. College of Architecture in the 1940s. She discontinued her education as she took active interest in the Indian independence movement, and then moved to the United States to pursue her studies in architecture. During the independence movement, she even suffered imprisonment. Leaving for the US, she was educated in the Illinois Institute of Design where she got her bachelor's degree in architecture. She then obtained her master's degree in architecture from the University of Chicago. After her education, she practiced for two years in Washington, D.C. She returned to India in 1956 to pursue her professional career in architecture. Professional life Mehta was involved in the design of houses, factories, schools, and institutions, but her structures no longer exist. In her plans, she adopted the modern practices of architectural designs she had imbibed during her studies in the US to an independent and \\"resurgent India\\". One such modern adaptation was her use of red sandstone to handcraft a stairway. She headed a research unit in Bombay city where the population was multi-social and where the socio-economic issues were complex. The research unit's task was to study the multi-diversity of the city, to conserve its socio-cultural life styles while evolving city plans to meet housing, sanitation, water supply, and other needs. She also aimed at establishing a link between architecture and other art forms. It was her view that traditional Indian art forms, which are rhythmic in style, could be translated to \\"the language of concrete and mortar\\". Her notable architectural designs include the Patel House, Kahim, a weekend resort facing the sea built in 1962 and said to have been influenced by Le Corbusier; and the Factory Chinchwada in Maharashtra called the J.B. Advani Oerlikon Electrodes Factory, which was built in 1963 with labour- intensive on-site fabrication, and whose ventilation and lighting were provided by a rhythmic arrangement of windows. A bridge across Vashi Creek in Navi Mumbai In 1964, Correa, together with Mehta and Patel, proposed a plan for New Bombay (now known as Navi Mumbai), which was different from the earlier plans prepared to extend the city limits upstream of the peninsula. Their vision has been compared to that in the popular Bollywood film Shre 420, a film set in Bombay, the theme of which was hope. In this effort under the influence of MARG, CIDCO gave them \\"key decision-making positions\\" which enabled them to prepare the Draft Development Plan of October 1973. This plan was approved for implementation in August 1979. The plan proposed government initiatives which included building new roads, bridges and industrial zoning. Mehta and her husband were also involved in dance, and she tried to blend the rhythm of the dance form in the planning of her buildings. A fine example of her blending the two forms is reflected in the audiovisual recording centre at Arehi, where in a limited space of , she maintained an aesthetic presentation of folklore and traditional colours. Working in a male-dominated society, her approach to work was dictated by her saying, \\"When a woman is truly committed to her career, when there is an inner compulsion, she ceases to regard herself as a woman but only acts as a professional\\".

Carved naratharas (human figures) and carved gajatharas (elephants) are depicted in panels at the base of the tower. Legends An interesting legend is narrated to justify separate dwelling temples, far away from each other, for Rukmini and her husband Krishna. It is said that at the request of sage Durvasa (who was renowned for his short temper and bestowing curses) Krishna and Rukmini pulled a chariot taking sage Durvasa to their house for dinner. On the way, when Rukmini asked for water to quench her thirst, Krishna drew Ganges water, by prodding the ground with his toe, for her to drink. Rukmini quenched her thirst with the Ganges water. But Durvasa felt insulted as Rukmini did not have the courtesy to offer him water to drink. He, therefore, cursed her that she would live separately from her husband.

He was a member of a theatrical family: among his uncles was the popular comedian Arthur Williams, and he was the father of Fred Emney, a comic character actor frequently seen on stage and screen in the mid-20th century. Life and career Emney's family had theatrical connections: his uncles were the comic performers Arthur Williams and Fred Williams (c.1847–1916).

It follows the same principle as the original Jigsaw method. The jigsaw technique in the cooperative learning methods uses a small group structure to facilitate group discussion through which the learning takes place. The reverse jigsaw method also resembles the original jigsaw method in some way but has its own objectives to be fulfilled. While the jigsaw method focuses on the student’s comprehension of the Instructor’s material, the reverse jigsaw method focuses on the participant’s interpretations such as perceptions, judgements through a very active discussion. This method was mainly created to cater the higher class students. It is best advised to give an explanation before the discussion the topics takes place. This not only ensure that the learners are more effective in their discussion but also saves time. It differs from the original Jigsaw during the teaching portion of the activity. In the Reverse Jigsaw technique, students in the expert groups teach the whole class rather than return to their home groups to teach the content.https://sites.google.com/site/7waysofeffectiveteaching/teaching-with- cooperation-learning/cooperative-learning-techniques = Process = The process involved in the reverse Jigsaw method can be explained in 3 steps # Students gather in mixed groups where they are each given a case study with a number of questions or one complex question and allotted time of about 15 mins to discuss. Each member of the team is given a unique topic and hence a discussion is initiated within the mixed group and the main points and the outcomes are noted. # Each member gather in the expert group or topic group and the points and outcomes are compared. A report is prepared compiling all the common and divergent themes. The time allotted for this could be between 15 - 20 mins. A reporter is appointed to present the same before the class. # The class gathers as a whole and the reporters from the individual topic group present their report to the whole class by ways of Overheads, flipcharts or chalk broad, following which the instructor debriefs the whole exercise with review or evaluation of the process. = Application = This technique could be mainly used in two fashions: Case study review and Topical Enquiry. The complex questions that are imposed on the students can be in the format: \\"Why do X?\\"; \\"How to do X?\\"; \\"Why not do X?\\", or \\"In what situations would X not be advised?\\"; and \\"Give an example of X.\\" These questions provide useful starting point and bring out the key elements of an effective discussion. = Requirements and limitations = * This method can be only applied to undergraduates, graduates and other professional training groups. * It is best preferred for students to form groups where they can face each other while discussing. * In case the classroom has immovable furniture, the instructor can opt to send the groups out for discussion and can give a time limit to assemble back in the classroom for the next part of the exercise. * During the discussions, the Instructor should float around the different groups to see if they are on the right track of discussion. * The Minimum and maximum limit in a group depend on the number of topics for discussion. It is recommended that if there are three topics to be discussed the minimum students required are nine and if there are four then at least twelve students, and if five topics then at least fifteen students are required. * Regular time checks have to be monitored as different groups may accomplish the task at different time.

The Dawnays descended from the lords of the manor at Shannock (or Shunock) in Sheviock, Cornwall. During the reign of Richard II, Thomas Dawnay, younger brother of Sir John Dawnay, married Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of John Newton of Snaith, Yorkshire. Thomas Dawnay settled in the Yorkshire parish of Escrick. His grandson Sir John Dawnay was the first of several Dawnays to serve as High Sheriff of Yorkshire. Cowick Hall was built in the late 17th century for John Dawnay, 1st Viscount Downe. The original architect is unknown, but the main house was significantly altered from 1752 to 1760 by James Paine for the third Viscount, including internal remodelling, rebuilding the south entrance and resetting the roof balustrade. Italian architect Joseph Bonomi designed additional alterations in the 1790s for the fifth Viscount, including redesigning the west staircase and an addition of the external south gallery. Bonodi returned for more work between 1804 and 1811, when he also designed the two-storey U-shaped coachhouse and stables. In 1869, the ninth viscount sold the estate for unknown reasons to Henry Shaw, a cotton spinner and also a fruit and vegetable exporter from Cleckheaton. The records from the sale described it thus: > The Hall is situated in the midst of a noble park of about 330 acres in > extent... and is approached through a long avenue of stately forest trees... > The outbuildings consist of superior stabling for twenty horses... two > saddle rooms, two large carriage houses, four grooms rooms... bakehouse and > brewhouse... The fruit and vegetable gardens are extensive and productive, > and enclosed by high brick walls, flued throughout and partially covered by > fruit trees. South side of Cowick Hall, To that Shaw added a two-storey, red-brick dower house in 1870. Shaw died suddenly in 1871, leaving the house to his brother Benjamin, who lived at Cowick Hall until 1889. Benjamin Shaw remodelled the interior of the main house, and during this process \\"destroyed much of the splendour of the house,\\" according to the Bishop of Sheffield David Lunn, who wrote a history of the surrounding area. Despite the unfortunate changes to the interior, Nikolaus Pevsner wrote that the main fronts of Cowick Hall were among the most accomplished 17th-century country house designs in England. Pevsner noted the decorated \\"cornice supported on pairs of large acanthus brackets above each pilaster,\\" with the giant carved and painted achievement of the Dawnay family with their motto TIMET PUDOREM (\\"he fears shame\\") above the door. In 1889, Samuel Joseph Cooper, an industrialist from Barnsley, purchased the home. He died in 1913 and thereafter Cowick Hall fell into neglect. It changed hands several times and at one point pigs lived in the cellars of the main house. In 1954, plans to demolish Cowick Hall took root. The house was rescued, however, in 1955, when it became the headquarters for local chemical company Croda International, which still occupies the house today.

The Story of Philosophy. DK Publishing, Inc., New York: 1998. p. 124 Content In this book, Diderot argued for a reconciliation of reason with feeling so as to establish harmony. According to Diderot, without feeling there would be a detrimental effect on virtue and no possibility of creating any sublime work. However, since feeling without discipline can be destructive, reason was necessary to rein in feeling. At the time Diderot wrote this book he was a deist. Hence there is a defense of deism in this book, and some arguments against atheism. The book also contains criticism of any kind of self-torture, including self- flagellation. For the 1770 edition of the work, Diderot included some additional material which contained even greater heresies; this included explicit criticism of Christianity, and contempt for theologians. Reception In July 1746, the Parlement of Paris condemned the book and ordered it to be burned in public.This enhanced the book's popularity. Since the book was very well written, and since Diderot preferred not to reveal himself as its author, it was thought by both Diderot's friends and enemies that the work was of some established author like Voltaire, La Mettrie, or Condillac.

She was born in Vryburg in the Northern Cape from Greek parents who had moved after inheriting a bakery from Siopis maternal grandfather. Siopis studied Fine Arts at Rhodes University in Makhanda, completing her master's degree in 1976, after which she pursued postgraduate studies at Portsmouth Polytechnic in the United Kingdom. She taught Fine Arts at the Technikon Natal in Durban from 1980 to 1983. In 1984 she took up a lectureship at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. During this time she was also visiting research fellow at the University of Leeds (1992-93) and visiting Professor in Fine Arts at Umeå University in Sweden (2000) as part of an interinstitutional exchange. With an Honorary Doctorate from Rhodes University, Makhanda - Siopis is currently Honorary Professor at Michaelis School of Fine Art, University of Cape Town. Early years She came to prominence in the early 1980s with her ‘cake’ paintings, which materially encode feminist aesthetics in thick impasto oil paint surfaces. These works were followed by her ‘history paintings’, interpreted as a form of resistance against apartheid. Her interdisciplinary practice since the national liberation of her country has explored the persistence and fragility of memory, notions of truth and the complex entanglements of personal and collective histories. Experimenting with a wide range of materials and processes, she reflects on the politics of the body, grief and shame, estrangement, migration and more recently the relationship between the human and the not-human within the context of climate change. All her explorations assert materiality and process as inseparable from concept, with her characteristic use of contingent and chance-driven methods becoming emblematic of her interest in ‘the poetics of vulnerability’. Griselda Pollock states, “Penny Siopis is one of the few artists in the world today who can weave a material web of marks, gestures, voices, words, found things and painted surfaces to entangle the brute forces of history with the delicate threads of human vulnerability.”  Work  Siopis established herself as one of the most talented and challenging artists in South Africa and beyond, by working across painting, installation and film, bringing together diverse references and materials in ways that disturb disciplinary boundaries and binaries. Obscure White Messenger, 2010, Film Still Concepts of time run through all her work often manifesting in the actual physical changes of her materials; in her early cake paintings oil paint is made to be unnaturally affected by gravity, age and decay; in her films using archival footage time is marked as much by the effects of age on the celluloid as by the historical period caught in the sweep of the camera; in her accumulations of found objects in her installations, ideas of the heirloom come to the fore with her ongoing conceptual work Will (1997 - ) - in which she bequeaths objects to beneficiaries - being the ultimate time piece only becoming complete on her death; her glue and ink paintings index flux as they record the material transformation that happens when viscous glue matter reacts with pigment, gravity, the artist's bodily gestures, and the drying effects of the air. Siopis sees her art practice as ‘open form’, operating as an intimate model in which the physical changes of her materials can be extrapolated into a larger ethics of personal and political transformation. According to Achille Mbembe this quality marks her interest in process as a perpetual state of becoming and entails \\"the crafting of an unstable relation between form and formlessness, in the understanding that the process of becoming proceeds in ways that are almost always unpredictable and at times accidental” Charmed Lives installation by Penny Siopis, Wits Art Museum, 2015 Tentacular Time, Stevenson Cape Town, 2019 = Paintings =  Cake paintings  Between 1980 and 1984 Siopis developed her 'cake' paintings which sprang from her childhood experiences of watching her mother ice cakes in the family bakery. Siopis’ fascination with the implements used in the shop gave rise to this first series of her career. Instead of the traditional paintbrush techniques, she used unconventional implements such as piping nozzles and other tools used in the decoration of cakes. Concerned with exploring the materiality of paint and its potential as object, Siopis worked with oil paint in a way that strayed from the norm, layering it thickly in high relief, in a technique referred to as ‘impasto’. This approach causes the outside layer of the medium to dry long before the interior, leading the surface to wrinkle and crack over time. Siopis’ skilful use of form and colour within this body of work evokes associations with skin and flesh. The physical changes visible on the surface of her works serve as a direct metaphor for the all too real effects of time and circumstance on the human body which ages, wrinkles and eventually decomposes. Challenging the conventions of Western art history that idealize the female nude, Siopis suggests female body parts in states of decay, decomposition and excess, both confrontational and vulnerable at the same time. While the female body is the main focus of these works, their association with food and decay comments on larger social narratives of decay which are developed in the paintings that follow. After her ‘cakes’ series, Siopis began to create the ‘banquet’ and early ‘history paintings’ in the mid- 1980s, extending into the early 1990s. These works coincided with the end of apartheid and South Africa's transition to a democratic nation. They commented on the excesses of colonialism and the mis/representation of race and gender within history. In contrast to the quieter, simpler compositions of the ‘cakes’ paintings, this body of work is epitomized by dramatically crowded scenes executed in intricate detail,- with tables full of food and other objects filling the canvas and emphasizing the idea of excess.  History paintings  Between 1985 and 1995 Penny Siopis produced a body of work often referred to as her ‘history paintings’. Although her interest in the materiality of paint and her experimentation with this medium never ceased, the works from this period differed in many important ways from the ‘cake’ paintings. The transition was already marked in her Still Life with Watermelon and Other Things (1985); it was even more clearly evident in Melancholia (1986). Presenting a vision of colonialism in decline, the scene in Melancholia is both a vanitas and a history painting. It combines symbols of European high culture and references to Africa, all of them piling up as the debris of history within a claustrophobic space that signifies excess, ruin and psychological malaise. In the past the genre of history painting was seen as the highest achievement of the European art historical tradition. Siopis’ ironic interrogation of its form and ideology is evident in such works as Patience on a Monument: ‘A History Painting’ (1988). In the history works she introduced the techniques of collage and assemblage as a means to disrupt direct depiction and to bring in references to the representations of colonial history that South Africans were brought up on through history books. These techniques also allowed her to mark the significance of objects as traces of history in their own right. Through the introduction of objects and found images her works challenged the invisible but powerful structures within the ideological systems of apartheid at a time when political tensions in the country were running high.  Pinky Pinky  The Pinky Pinky body of work was created between 2002 and 2004. Pinky Pinky is the visualization of a South African urban legend in which a creature that is part human, part animal, part man, part woman, not white, not black, but an amalgamation of forms, preys on children in school toilets and threatens to rape girls if they wear pink underwear. It is visible to girls but invisible to boys who experience its presence through a slap or a scratch on a cheek. After hearing the story from her son's school friend, Siopis embarked on a personal exploration of Pinky Pinky, producing visual representations of this mysterious figure according to verbal accounts by school children she interviewed on the topic. Here, as in her early ‘cake’ paintings, the artist manipulates paint and form to simulate skin and flesh. The works exclusively use shades of pink, starting with the category of ‘flesh colour'. Siopis tinted the flesh colour in different ways, creating tones ranging from the cotton candy sugary sweetness signifying childhood to tones that act as metaphors for violation. Siopis applied thick layers of oil paint onto canvases using only a palette knife, building up areas of relief and texture – pocking and cutting its surface to the desired effect. Found objects such as glass eyes, plastic dolls, toe nails, teeth and eyelashes were added to the wet painted surface to bring the creature in its various configurations to life. It is often only through the effects of light on painted surface that form can be determined, giving the very visceral images a ghostlike quality. The series investigates personal and public narratives around fear and trauma in South Africa, giving form to things that seem impossible to speak about directly. It is an allegory of the nation's deepest fears around issues of poverty, xenophobia, race, and crime, - at a time of radical social transition and uncertainty post- 1994. These at times playful configurations also serve as sites of felt and imagined traumas in a society where violence committed against women and children is far too common.  Shame paintings  Siopis began the Shame paintings in 2002 and they became a key feature of her exhibition Three Essays on Shame (2005), an intervention in the museum of Sigmund Freud, once his house, in London. It was part of a project that marked the centenary of Freud's groundbreaking publication Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality. Responding to Freud, Siopis’ installation consisted of three parts located in Freud's study (with the famous couch), dining room and bedroom and titled Voice, Gesture and Memory. The small paintings shown in a grid in this room were presented as a frieze in the Memory section of the original exhibition. The artist invokes this exhibition here through the arrangement of some of the objects from the installation on a table reminiscent of that in Freud's dining room, where she had placed Baubo, one of Freud's objects from his collection of antiquities. Baubo is a small terracotta figurine who gestures to her genitalia in a provocative way, an act some have interpreted as a show of shame that speaks of both vulnerability and empowerment. In the installation Siopis also evoked a complex dialogue between Freud's ideas and her personal experiences by inserting references (voice recordings and objects) to the traumatic proceedings of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and colonial and apartheid history. Once again she was interested in binding the traces of human vulnerability and the dramatic effects of sweeping historical narratives. In this body of work Siopis manipulates thick and gooey lacquer gel paint, used in home-craft to create stained glass and coloured mirror effects on surfaces. For her it is a physical process that moulds anxiety into form. It translates the result of childhood trauma that we know as shame onto a painted surface. Through the reflective qualities of the medium Siopis blends the bodily sensation with the experience of being looked at, both of which define shame. The use of language in the form of ready-made rubber stamped clichés that clash with the raw power of this familiar emotion further underscores the ‘unspeakable’ character of the experience. Siopis goes on to explore this in different ways in the Pinky Pinky series in the adjacent room.  Ink and glue paintings  From 2007 to presently Penny Siopis extends her range of medium and scale of imagery to large expansive canvases encased in viscous glue and fluid inks in large, expansive canvases. In this body of work the artist's skilful use of the associative qualities of her imagery and the inherent properties of this new medium creates scenes that are full of both violence and eroticism. Although there is a dramatic shift in pictorial representation, the manner in which the medium acts on the surfaces remains of central concern. Embedded in the medium itself is the opportunity to work in a completely different mode where the dance of chance and the directness of the process allow the artist broader scope for imaginative association. There is also a move to abstraction where line begins to define and dissolve form and bleed across surfaces – where images appear to emerge from the medium itself. The process involves a mix of ink, glue and occasionally water which are manipulated through splashing, dripping and moving the canvas to direct the flow. There is a strong element of surprise in this manner of working, as the final image only becomes apparent when dry. This openness to risk and the ‘accidents’ that happen as a consequence is what ultimately animates each work. = Installation = In the 1990s, Siopis extended her range of media to include monumental installations, film and video. The main focus of Siopis’ works is often visualised in existing objects. Siopis has always been interested in objects as carriers of meaning beyond themselves. Her installations have taken different forms but Charmed Lives, exhibited in 1999 at New York's Museum for African Art, became the core form and concept that shaped versions that followed. All the objects in the installations are from Siopis’ collection. In Charmed Lives they are arranged into sequences that speak of the fragile and unstable quality of memory, both personal and collective, asking probing questions about the nature of the archive and the relative truth of a historical record. Occasionally, some are singled out to become part of the ongoing Will project. The installation Will, started in 1997, functions as an ultimate time piece. Siopis sees it becoming alive only on her death: she has singled out objects from her vast collection and bequeathed them to individuals all around the world. Upon her passing they will be sent out to their recipients. Seen as an autobiographical project, this particular collection also functions as an archive and inventory of both personal and collective history. The work comments on the lives and perceptions of objects that could function both as art and heirloom, representing different values for those who possessed them before the artist and those who will end up owning them in the future. The installation presupposes an end through its own fragmentation. It will continue living as a memory; at the same time the objects, having been dispersed, will acquire new meanings that have the potential to continue to evolve forever. = Video/Film = Siopis began working with film in 1994 with her film Per Kind Permission: Fieldwork. However, in 1997 Siopis found her niche in film making through the work My Lovely Day. She has continued to work with film throughout her career and describes the videos as montages, cut-and-paste images that move and unfold over time. Combined with text and music, film offers a wonderful opportunity for narrative. In My Lovely Day Siopis cuts sequences from her mom's 8mm home movies that she took of their family life in the 50s and 60s, and the more public events that were caught in the sweep of her camera. She combined these with music and the remembered words of her grandmother, presented as subtitles. She wove the story of three generations of women, as a kind of transgenerational haunting. The story compresses historical time into one day. The historical moment of her telling is apartheid South Africa, but her references to social turmoil and catastrophe are to earlier times: the ‘exchange of populations’ following the Greco-Turkish conflict of 1919–1922, the massive migrations sparked by the two World Wars and the beginnings of the decolonisation of Africa. Her mother's home movies led Siopis to the home movies of strangers, which she finds in flea markets and thrift shops in South Africa and on her travels abroad. She now has a huge archive of found film that she mines continually. Siopis sees the film as a ready-made in that it brings its own history and context into the scene. She cuts sequences from the film which she connects to the text in mostly allusive ways. So, whoever views it will shape their narrative too. All the videos take a very particular story from South African history that has an elemental quality and speaks beyond its historical circumstances; two of them, Obscure White Messenger (2010) and The Master is Drowning (2012), look at the actual and attempted assassinations of apartheid Prime Minister H.F. Verwoerd. Siopis draws on various archival sources to construct the narrative, and use different modes of address, but she prefers the first person. In Obscure White Messenger she uses a question and answer format, which she drew from the psychiatrist's report of the interview he had with Dimitrio Tsafendas, immediately after the murder. In the beginning of the film it is not easy to work out who is talking: who's the ‘you’ and who's the ‘I’?.

This was neither the modern University of Florida nor the modern Florida Gators, but a team fielded by one of its four predecessor institutions that had been known as Florida Agricultural College until 1903. The were led by player-coach Marvin O. Bridges, whose brothers also played on the squad. Various public and private colleges in Florida had organized football teams before 1904, but the programs were informal, and schedules usually consisted of a few games played against in-state colleges and local athletic clubs in venues that were little more than open fields. The University of Florida at Lake City sought to jump-start its football program by playing the most ambitious schedule of any Florida school to date. The \\"Blue and White\\" had never faced off against an out of state opponent, but they assembled a 1904 slate which featured road games against several established southern football programs, including Mike Donahue's first Auburn squad and John Heisman's first team at Georgia Tech. The entire schedule was played in October. To reduce travel costs, the team played four road games during a two and a half week train trek through Alabama and Georgia. They returned to Lake City in mid-October and concluded the season with their lone home game, a match-up with in-state rival Florida State College on October 21.The slate proved too ambitious for the fledgling program, as the squad went winless and did not score a single point over the entire season. The difficult 1904 season would be the final campaign for the Blue and White. The Florida legislature consolidated the University of Florida in Lake City with three other state-supported institutions in 1905 to establish the modern University of Florida in Gainesville. When the new school began its football program in 1906, there were no players from the 1904 Blue and White squad on the roster. 1904 Schedule Game summaries =Alabama= The season opened with a 29-0 loss to Alabama.

McGuire (fullback) =Florida State College= The Blue and White had reason for optimism coming into their last game of the season against the Florida State College Eleven (FSC). They were finally playing a home game, they had beaten FSC in Lake City in 1902, and FSC had been beaten soundly by Georgia Tech in the only game they'd played of their 1904 slate. This was not first meeting between FSC's player-coach Jack Forsythe and Marvin Bridges, his counterpart for the Blue and White; Forsythe was a player on the Clemson Tigers team that tied Bridges' Cumberland Bulldogs in a 1903 battle which was dubbed the SIAA championship game. Their 1904 match-up was not nearly as close; the Blue and White were shut out again and lost 23-0. As a newspaper account reported, \\"The people of Lake City had expected at least one victory after a long series of defeats encountered by the university and were greatly disappointed. The university should be made stronger before it attempts to play again.\\" FSC would go on to beat Stetson and lay claim to a \\"state championship\\". 1905 season 1905 was a year of transition. The Florida legislature had completely reorganized the state's system of higher education with the passage of the Buckman Act. The University of Florida in Lake City was consolidated with three other state colleges (including Florida State College) to form the new \\"University of the State of Florida\\", a school for men in Gainesville, while the campus of Florida State College in Tallahassee was transformed into a school for women. Construction began immediately on the campus in Gainesville, but it would not be ready for use until the fall of 1906. In the meantime, classes were offered at the existing Lake City campus during the 1905-1906 academic year. The hybrid University of Florida in Lake City attempted to field a football team in the fall of 1905 but was unsuccessful. Five contests against small colleges in Florida and Georgia were scheduled, but four were cancelled because too many players were deemed to be \\"behind in their studies\\" by university president Andrew Sledd, who wanted to improve the academic rigor of the new institution. The last game of the 1905 season against the Julian London Institute kicked off in Jacksonville but was never completed. Florida's squad refused to take the field for the second half after discovering that the opposing team included a professional player, and the game was suspended with Florida leading 6-0. The University of the State of Florida completed its move to Gainesville for the 1906-1907 academic year. When the school finally completed its first football game on October 13, 1906, their coach was former FSC head coach Jack Forsythe, and no player who had played a game for the Lake City Blue and White was on the roster.

It is a utopian fiction that has been compared to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. The book was presented in an English version by Basil Hall Chamberlain in 1879. The name Wasōbyōe (also the name of the story's protagonist) is derived from that of Zhuang Zhou, wasō meaning Japan and byōe being a Japanese form of Zhuang Zhou's family name. The story promotes Taoist concepts over their Confucian equivalents, and Chamberlain suggested that its parable-like structure was intended to replicate the style of the Zhuangzi. In the tale, the titular Wasōbyōe sets out by boat from his native Nagasaki on a business trip, but is blown off course by a typhoon. He is shipwrecked in the Land of Perennial Youth, where he lives for 200 years, and he subsequently visits a number of other fictitious countries, including the Land of Idlers, the Land of Shams, the Land of Ancient Customes, the Land of Paradox and the Land of Giants. Wasōbyōe was popular in its day, and spawned at least two sequels, Wasōbyōe kohen (1779) by Sawai Iro and Wasōbyōe zokuhen (1854) by Kokunen Kocho Sanjin. In 1797 Santō Kyōden wrote a play based on the work, Wasobyoe gojitsu hanashi, and Takizawa Bakin modelled his book Musobyōe kocho monagatori on Yukokushi's tale.

The story is about a manga artist who is pulled into the world of the manga he is concluding and forced to confront his characters. The manga was serialized in the manga magazine Comic Guys from October 1995 until the magazine's cancellation in June 1996. It was collected into two volumes by Tokuma Shoten on December 13, 2010 and included a missing ending found after Kon's death. Dark Horse Comics licensed the manga in North America and released it in an omnibus edition on December 9, 2014. The French edition of the manga won the 2013 Asia Critics Prize from the Association des Critiques et des journalistes de Bande Dessinée and was nominated for the Sélection Officiele at the 2014 Angoulême International Comics Festival. Opus was Kon's final manga before he debuted in the anime industry with Perfect Blue. Plot Manga artist Chikara Nagai is in the process of ending his current serial, Resonance, by having the heroine, investigator and telepath Satoko Miura, fight the brainwashing cult leader of the \\"Nameless Faith\\", the Masque, and having the esper Lin sacrifice himself to defeat the Masque. While working late to meet his deadline, he encounters the angry Lin stealing the two-page spread of his death and Nagai is sucked into his manga in the middle of a fight between Satoko and the Masque. She helps him escape, but meanwhile, the Masque brainwashes Chief Hanamura of the Special Forces to find them. When Lin finds the Masque, they fight outside of the boundaries of the manga that were drawn, revealing cracks that lead to other pages. When the chief finds Satoko, Lin attempts to escape through a crack with her, but Satoko is shot in the process. Nagai falls through the bottom of the world and ends up back in the real world, but finds that he cannot draw Lin and finish the final spread. Frustrated, he breaks into the sketch of an alternate ending, rescuing Satoko from being shot by the chief and bringing her into the real world. Satoko explores the area and while reading the manga about her, finds Lin appearing in an earlier volume. From her experience, she determines that Nagai's world is just as cruel as hers and they resolve to save her world. When they go back, they find that the manga's world is disintegrating and the Masque and Hanamura try to kill them again. The world disappears, save for Nagai. He finds Lin's sister Mei, who gives him his lost pen, and he redraws Satoko. They travel back to the first volume of Resonance, where Satoko was the target of a serial killer, but was saved by the police detective and telepath Sawamura, who died in the process and was reincarnated as Lin. Nagai suggests that they avoid interfering with the story, but when they interact with characters from the world, cracks start forming. Lin finds the killer, the precursor to the Masque, and tries to kill him, but is stopped by Nagai and Satoko. After the younger Satoko is kidnapped, the group and a wounded Sawamura try to save her. The killer finds a copy of Resonance and foresees an ambush by Sawamura, killing him. Lin is shot while trying to stop him but kills the serial killer, releasing the older Masque who had hidden inside his body. The freed Masque takes control of the world and the party falls into the world of the second volume. Unable to do anything, the group continues falling as Nagai declares that it is \\"the end.\\" Satoshi Kon, the artist of Opus, is informed of the cancellation of \\"Comic Guard\\" magazine and laments the fact that he could have finished the story in three chapters. Later, he calls his editor and tells him about a final chapter he is working on for an abrupt ending, but can't draw it because he is busy with Perfect Blue. Nagai appears out of the chapter and admonishes him for not completing his story, offering ideas for getting it published. Kon's wife arrives home and screams at the sight of Nagai. Release The manga was serialized in Gakken's bi-monthly manga magazine Comic Guys starting in October 1995 until the cancellation of the magazine in June 1996. As Kon started working on Perfect Blue and focusing on his anime career, Opus was put on permanent hiatus and Kon later came to refer to it as a failure. Tokuma Shoten collected the 19 chapters into two volumes published on December 13, 2010 under its Ryu Comics imprint, adding a missing ending found after Kon's death. The final chapter, found in Kon's files, was never finished or published and was included by the publisher to help readers \\"understand the intent of the story\\". During Sakura-Con 2014, Dark Horse Comics announced that it had licensed the manga and would compile it in omnibus format, subsequently publishing it on December 9, 2014. In April 2012, Kon's widow Kyōko announced that Opus would be sold in French, Italian, and Korean. The manga has been released in France by Éditions IMHO, in Italy by Panini Comics, in Korea by Daewon C.I., in Germany by Carlsen Comics, and in Spain by Planeta de Libros. At Japan Expo 2017, producer Masao Maruyama of Studio M2 expressed an unofficial wish to produce an anime adaptation of the manga with his studio. Susumu Hirasawa, a composer who frequently worked on Kon's films, stated on Twitter in October 2017 that he was asked to work on a theme song for the series. However, it was not clear whether he was referring to Maruyama's desired project, as no announcements have been made for an anime adaptation of Opus. Reception MangaBlog's Brigid Alverson found the action hard to follow which pulled her out of the story, while Katherine Dacey said that she \\"normally find[s] these kind of meta-exercises tedious, but Kon infuses the story with a sense of playful urgency that thwarts the urge to deconstruct every page.\\" The Fandom Post complimented Kon's use of metafiction as part of a story \\"rife with questions of existentialism and predestination\\". Paul Gravett listed it number one on his top ten manga of 2014 and called Opus a \\"mind-blowing meta-manga\\" that is \\"overflowing with ideas and imagination\\", adding that it shares much in common with Kon's films and would have made a good anime adaption. The Comics Journal said that the plot is \\"as 'Satoshi Kon' a scenario as can possibly be imagined\\" and noted the goal of the title in \\"reaching for the stars\\". The French edition of the manga won the 2013 Asia Critics Prize from the Association des Critiques et des journalistes de Bande Dessinée and was part of the Sélection Officiele at the 2014 Angoulême International Comics Festival. It was also on the 2016 Young Adult Library Services Association's Great Graphic Novels for Teens List.

It consists of loosely connected short stories about young adults in modern Japan and their life decisions. The manga was serialized in Shogakukan's Monthly Sunday Gene-X from 2002 to 2004 and is licensed in North America by Viz Media.  Release  The manga was serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Monthly Sunday Gene-X by Shogakukan from June 2002 to April 2004. Shogakukan collected the 19 chapters into two volumes from May 19, 2003 to May 19, 2004. Shogakukan also included the manga in a collection of Asano's original works in 2010. The series was licensed in North America by Viz Media in February 2009, with both volumes published on October 20, 2009. The manga has also been published in France by Kana, in Germany by Egmont Manga & Anime and Tokyopop Germany (republisher), and in Taiwan by Taiwan Tohan. Asano wrote a sequel to the 11th story \\"After the Rain\\" in the August 2008 issue of Monthly Sunday Gene-X titled \\"What a Wonderful World\\", which was also collected in Before Dawn and the End of the World.  Reception  Reviewers have praised Asano's art and writing, but noted the limitations of the short story format for character development as well as Asano's overuse of character tropes. About.com's Shaenon Garrity called it an excellent debut work which, while not as good as Asano's later works and lacking in some stories, has great art and writing. Deb Aoki called the manga \\"mysterious, humorous, magical and tragic all at the same time,\\" adding that it \\"remind[s] us that living can be the greatest adventure of all.\\" Grant Goodman of PopCultureShock called the manga unique and solid, but felt that half of the chapters were not memorable and that the theme of \\"life's losers\\" made the stories feel repetitive and predictable. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network complimented the stories that were slightly surreal as well as Asano's penwork, but disliked the \\"woe-is-me\\" facet of the stories. David Welsh of The Comics Reporter disliked the use of overdone tropes in the stories, but praised the design of average-looking characters and the page composition, finding the stories \\"polished and effective,\\" but not \\"linger[ing] in the mind\\". Johanna Carlson of Comics Worth Reading found the traits of the characters to be annoying but said that the detailed and expressive art grounded the story, making it more believable. Leroy Douresseaux of ComicBookBin praised Asano's ability to depict the struggles of young people in the first volume, but felt that this was downplayed by the large number of characters. He called Asano's ability to \\"balance and compare and contrast what is celebrated and what is ridiculous about life\\" the most engaging part of the second volume. Publishers Weekly found that Asano's characters were \\"prone to platitudes\\" but not as much as in Solanin, with the shorter stories also making the characters more sympathetic, and called the artwork and storytelling attractive. Al Sparrow of IGN noted the theme of survival in the stories, remarking that Asano portrays youth through an unfiltered lens. Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics found the stories to vary in quality, but called the manga charming and described the art as a \\"beautifully delicate creation\\".

It runs in both an east-west direction between Burbank (Brisbane) and Sheldon (Redlands), and a north-south direction between Capalaba (Redlands) and Carbrook (Logan). In total, the road is approximately long, and is split at a three-way roundabout. The road is notable for connecting three adjacent local government areas of Queensland: the City of Brisbane, Redland City, and the City of Logan. As there are no highways in this region east of the Gateway and Pacific Motorways, Mount Cotton Road often provides the fastest link between the three cities (more so regarding the south-east of Brisbane and north-east of Logan). History The branching segments of Mount Cotton Road were originally known by multiple different names. The Burbank segment, west of the aforementioned roundabout, was once known as Broadwater Road, while the resulting northern branch was known as Capalaba School Road. Initially, Mount Cotton Road would have referred to the path travelled by the earliest colonial settlers of Mount Cotton in the mid-1800s. As the surrounding region grew and became better-connected, the name spread to some adjoining roads, causing the multi-branched structure of Mount Cotton Rd today. Much of the road was once surrounded by farmland. This was gradually replaced with residential properties, prompting the roadside construction of: the Carbrook Lutheran Cemetery and Church in the 1870s; Capalaba State School in 1880; telephone lines, a community hall, and an avicultural farm in 1935-36; a store and post office in 1948; a Salvation Army hall in 1960; and Capalaba Park Shopping Centre in 1981. With the construction of the Leslie Harrison Dam in the 1960s, the portions of the road near Tingalpa Creek were upgraded. Sections of Mt Cotton Rd have since been identified as dangerous driving areas, due to high incidences of crashes with other cars and wallabies, leading to investigations in recent years. Mt Cotton Road has been identified as a terminus point for the Coomera Connector, a highway project designed to parallel the M1.

It was launched in support of her fifth studio album, I Am (2015). The tour was announced on 11 September 2015 with a run of fourteen dates across Great Britain. It began on 21 February 2016 at the Liverpool Empire Theatre and concluded on 11 March 2016 at the Plymouth Pavilions. The leg also included two nights at the London Palladium. The English singer-songwriter Philippa Hanna served as the support act, and the English singer-songwriter Joss Stone joined Lewis on stage as a special guest for the final show of the tour to perform a cover of \\"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\\" by Eurythmics and Aretha Franklin. Lewis performed a nineteen-song set list with a four-piece band and two backup vocalists. Her vocals, stage presence and interaction with the crowds was lauded by the critics in attendance. Many singled out her performance of \\"Ave Maria\\" as the set's highlight, while others also praised renditions of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", \\"A Moment Like This\\" and \\"Run\\". Several noted that nearly a third of the set list consisted of both official covers recorded by Lewis previously included on her albums, as well as cover songs intended just for the tour. Some were complimentary of the unofficial covers, most notably Lewis' version of \\"Time After Time\\" by Cyndi Lauper, whereas others felt that there were too many and that they were too forgettable. Background To promote her fifth studio album, I Am (2015), on 11 September 2015 Leona Lewis announced her third headlining concert tour, titled the I Am Tour, was to take place in February and March 2016. It was her first concert tour since the Glassheart Tour in 2013. Spanning fourteen shows visiting various concert halls and theatres in England, Scotland and Wales, the tour began at the Liverpool Empire Theatre on 21 February and concluded at the Plymouth Pavilions on 11 March; it also included two dates at the London Palladium. Lewis announced the tour on 11 September 2015 and tickets went on sale a week later on 18 September. Speaking about touring again, Lewis said that she was \\"So so excited to announce a 2016 UK Tour! I cannot wait to get out and perform all the new songs for you and some old favourites too!\\" In an interview for What's On magazine in December 2015, Lewis revealed that she had originally planned for the tour to be longer, but decided to shorten it in order to spend time with family and friends and start writing songs for her sixth studio album sooner. Critical reception Katie Fitzpatrick of the Manchester Evening News reported that fans in attendance at the Manchester Bridgewater Hall show were impressed with Lewis' performance, writing that many took to social media following the concert to describe her as \\"the best singer in the world\\". Reporting on the show at The Sage Gateshead, the Chronicle Live critic Gordon Barr praised Lewis' confidence and her band. He noted that the production was relatively simple compared to the big-budget production values of her first concert tour in 2010, The Labyrinth. With the tour featuring just two background vocalists and a four-piece band, Barr wrote that it was \\"so refreshing to see an artist on stage just loving the music\\". He singled out performances of \\"Ave Maria\\", \\"Run\\", and a cover of \\"Time After Time\\" by Cyndi Lauper as the show's highlights. Barr described the performance of \\"Time After Time\\" as \\"stripped back to the core\\" which enabled the crowd to \\"really [hear] that incredible voice at its best\\". Allan Jones of the Bournemouth Echo was also complimentary of Lewis' performance during the show at the Bournemouth International Centre. Although he disapproved of the performance of \\"Ave Maria\\" (but noted that it garnered a standing ovation from the crowd), he thought that standout performances included \\"Run\\", \\"Bleeding Love\\", and Lewis' cover of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" by Roberta Flack. He concluded his review by writing that Lewis has \\"that really big soul/pop voice that should see her continuing to pack venues for the next ten years\\". I Am\\" at the London Palladium on 5 March 2016. Caroline Abbott of the Torquay Herald Express described the backdrop as \\"five strips of giant toilet paper\\". Adrian Caffery of the Birmingham Mail gave a mixed review of the show at the city's Symphony Hall. While he was complimentary of Lewis' vocals performances on most of the original tracks, most notably on \\"Ave Maria\\", which he described as demonstrating \\"an amazing transformation to opera diva\\", he was critical of Lewis' decision to include seven cover songs on the set list. Although Caffery wrote that \\"Run\\", \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", \\"Ave Maria\\", and \\"A Moment Like This\\" – the last of which he described as \\"cheesy\\" – were to be expected, as Lewis had recorded them for previous albums. However, he disapproved of \\"Time After Time\\", labelling it \\"ok\\", and called the Sam Smith covers \\"instantly forgettable\\". He concluded by writing: \\"There was enough evidence to suggest Leona is capable of staging an utterly mesmerising show from start to finish – just not this time\\". A critic from The Bristol Post wrote that Lewis \\"dazzled\\" the audience who \\"[enjoyed] Leona's impressive vocals and stunning songs\\", placing emphasis on her rendition of \\"Time After Time\\". In a review of Lewis' performance at the London Palladium on 5 March, William J Connolly of Gay Times praised the singer's openness regarding her personal and private life throughout the show, which gave the audience an insight as to \\"why she's remained quiet in previous months and why, as we all love, each album is full of emotion and honesty\\". He singled out \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", \\"Bleeding Love\\", and \\"Thunder\\" as the show's highlights, and described \\"Run\\" as \\"perfect\\". Emma Noye of the Ipswich Star wrote that despite there being some Americanisms in the show, such as \\"horse-riding, beach-walking backing visuals with a voiceover talking about the 'journey' she's been on\\", Lewis' voice was \\"indisputably fantastic\\". Noye went on to write that the singer \\"made everyone feel included and engaged\\" and praised her performance of \\"Ave Maria\\" as \\"stunning\\". In her review of the concert at the Plymouth Pavilions, Caroline Abbott of the Torquay Herald Express praised Lewis for her interaction with the crowd and her \\"down-to-earth\\" persona, as well as her performances of \\"Ave Maria\\", \\"Thank You\\", and \\"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\\", a duet with the special guest Joss Stone. Noting that a third of the set-list was made up of covers, she expressed dislike for Lewis' interpretation of \\"Time After Time\\". Abbott wrote that her \\"only real criticism\\" of the performance was for the stage production, which she described as \\"five strips of giant toilet paper hanging at the back, occasionally changing colour, and spaced a little too far apart to make for easy viewing of the video footage of Leona explaining why her music is so important to her\\". Abbott did, however, note that the backdrop did not detract from the \\"high quality music\\" or her \\"incredible, effortless voice\\".

It is considered acting as links between human beings and divine. It is also counted as the lowest level of celestial intelligences.  Concept  Aql has many different meanings in Islamic philosophy and psychology. The word aql means to restrain or to tie philologically. Reason namely something which prevent human from hurry judgment and behavior. Aql gradually transformed to reason semantically. In Islamic philosophy, particularly peripatetic, the technical use of aql to some extent is under affection of Greek philosophy.  Historical background  For the first time, Farabi numerated several meanings of aql in his book. Avempace or ibn Bajjeh knows the goal of human and philosopher as connection and unity with active intellect. Active intellect is the last emanation of intelligences which accounts for the forms in the nature world. Through active intellect we could know that what the reality of things in nature is.According to Avicenna those who could separate their souls from earthly distractions, at the same time could united with the active intellect during a journey. in Islamic philosophy the active intellect has to do with Neoplatonic cosmology. this intelligence is associates with moon and Angel Jibril or Holy Spirit (Islam). peripatetic philosophers in Islamic world try to show a Platonized version of active intellect on the basis of which human soul and sensible world united with intelligence and intelligibility. Farabi try to reconciles between peripatetic attitude of active intellect with the Islamic notion of prophecy. Farabi identifies active intellect with jibril, is Islam the angel of revelation. Human could transformed from Aql bi-l-quwwah (potential intellect) into Aql bi-l-fi'l (actual intellect). Thereby human could free themselves from the darkness of ignorance. Finally aql reached to Aql Al-mustafad (the acquired intellect).in the level of acquires intellect, aql reflects upon its own contents through inquiring among its similarities and distinction.  Characteristics  Aql Faal has many basic role in epistemology and psychology in Islamic philosophy.some of them are as follow: # active intellect acted as an intellection such a way that providing forms for sublunary world # it also transforms potential Aql to the level of actual Aql in epistemology and sense perception # it also enable us to separate between intelligible from Sense perception objects # active intellect also helps to perfect human souls # Wahib Al-suwar helps to acquiring highest of happiness # Aql Faal also helps to immortality of souls # active intellect helps to explain the mechanism of revelation  See also  *Active intellect *Islamic philosophy  References  Category:Islamic philosophy Category:Islamic terminology ","title":"Al-aql al-faal"},{"id":"47784086","title":"Mark A.

The film is about two days in the life of an ageing writer who is in the brink of extinction and a youthful soul who is in utter need of inspiration and happens to seek it in the arms of an anguished writer.  Synopsis  The two days in the life of an aging writer who is in the brink of extinction and a youthful soul who is in utter need of inspiration and happens to seek it in the arms of an anguished writer. The old man is a well-known and celebrated writer of his generation, but since the death of his wife and his daughter he has not been able to complete his book due to the bitterness, which he has also developed over the years for the world and the people which inherit it. The book that he is working on is said to be a masterpiece like his earlier work or perhaps even of a much higher caliber. The old man has not left his house for a long time now and refuses to take part in any humanly activities. He has closed himself behind his four shabby walls and there he performs acts of vandalism within his closed closet. Though the world must have forgotten him and his words, there still resides a young man who has found bliss in his company but due to certain circumstances has not been able to visit the writer for about two weeks now. The young man happens to be a teacher in a school teaching children English literature and tries to inspire his students with inadequate or rather grim methods. He is married to a young woman who tries to keep him happy with what she knows of happiness. The young couple is expecting their first child and instead of getting closer they move further apart from each other. Their relationship is tested when the young man starts to see the world from the old man’s gloomy perceptive and starts to question his place in society and in this world. As the old man and the young man argue and question their place in society, they find out that they both aren’t that further apart from each other. Though they have lived in a different time and era but their outlook towards the decaying world and humanity remains the same. The meaning of existence and one’s right to their own free will are reflected in the film. And the question that “is one truly the master of his own craft?” is touched during the course of the film.

Go ahead for Norton GP attack, Mat Oxley. Accessed and added 26 October 2015 Development =RC588= Tracing its origins to the motor from the Norton Classic devised and developed by David Garside at BSA in the 1970s, the racing engine was nevertheless the creation of Brian Crighton, who joined the Norton factory at Shenstone, Staffordshire in 1984 from a background in electronic engineering to oversee the service department's maintenance of the Norton Commander for the Police Force, and was responsible for establishing Norton's return to racing.Motor Cycle News (UK weekly newspaper) 12 September 1990, pp.cover, 25. Crighton shock for Norton Team, Mat Oxley. Accessed and added 23 October 2015 After recognising the engine was capable of producing much more power, Crighton firstly received no backing from Norton management, instead developing the engine in his own time, until sanctioned by the factory in late 1987 with the prototype race bike debuted by Norton employee Malcolm Heath at Darley Moor. Road-going Norton Classic air- cooled engine with full cooling finsBased on an ex-police bike engine, it was restricted to club-level racing as the ACU had not decided on how to categorise the rotary engine as it was so unusual.A simple engine, Motorcycle Sport, January 1989, pp.41-43. Accessed 4 February 2019 One of the initial changes for racing was to reduce the cooling-fin area on the engine, as when racing, the machines were moving at much higher speeds than the road-going types, where traffic police and RAC breakdown patrols had experienced overheating when in slow-moving convoys. Also added was Ram Air induction from fairing-mounted air scoops, which Motorcycle Sport confirmed in 1988 that Crighton had used since 1972, \\"...some years before Honda, who later claimed it as one of their innovatory applications...\\", and a longer induction-length. Power output was stated to be raised from road-going 79 bhp to 130 bhp, or with maximum ram-effect at a high-speed circuit of 140 bhp. The engine was basically similar to the road version, but fitted into a monoshock Spondon aluminium frame with Kayaba front forks and Dymag wheels. The revised induction system was simplified, abandoning the road system where the cooling air was routed through the engine rotors before being fed into the carburettors. Instead, exhaust-gas velocity was used with a venturi to create a low pressure area that dragged the air through the engine components and into the exhaust system. Crighton confirmed the usual method of modifying a road engine for racing was to replace the essential components of crankshaft, conrods, pistons and camshafts – but the rotary had none of these. Even raising the compression ratio was extremely difficult, requiring re-engineered rotors and/or altered motion within the chambers. Instead, modifications were made in similar style to two-stroke engines, by changes to the internal ports controlling intake mixture and waste gases, in conjunction with enhanced carburation and exhaust gas extraction. Initially the team raced with a limited budget in 1988 with riders Trevor Nation and Simon Buckmaster,Norton's Racing Rotary, Motorcycle Sport, June 1988, p.Cover, p.251.

He is currently the founder and CEO of Emles Advisors LLC, an asset management firm. Early life and education Hammond grew up in Potomac, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. He has a brother, Daniel. Hammond graduated from Johns Hopkins. Hammond also graduated from the Mercersburg Academy. He is pursuing his PhD in Psychology at Harvard University. Career After graduating from Johns Hopkins, Mr. Hammond began his career at Goldman Sachs & Co in the Energy & Power Group within the Equity Research Division, before founding Alerian Capital Management, LLC, in 2004, the first and leading energy infrastructure data and analytics company to create investment vehicles in the Master Limited Partnerships (MLP) asset class. Alerian is most known for creating the Alerian MLP Index, the benchmark index for MLPs in the energy infrastructure industry. In 2009, Mr. Hammond created the SteelPath MLP Funds, an energy infrastructure mutual fund family focused on the MLP asset class, creating the first MLP open-ended funds. The funds provided investors access, liquidity, and transparency in energy infrastructure through the MLP asset class. Mr. Hammond served as the Chief Executive Officer, President and Portfolio Manager of SteelPath before he sold the SteelPath mutual funds family to Oppenheimer Funds in 2012, with assets under management of $3.3 billion at the time of sale. In December 2012 OppenheimerFunds, Inc. acquired SteelPath, which had $3.3 billion in assets under management. In 2007, Mr. Hammond and Alerian launched what would become the J.P. Morgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (Ticker: AMJ), the first passively managed MLP exchange-traded product to track the Alerian Index. In 2010, Mr. Hammond launched the Alerian MLP ETF (Ticker: AMLP), the first MLP exchange- traded fund, which has become the largest publicly available MLP investment product. Total assets under management linked to the Alerian Index series exceeded $17 billion by 2015. In July of 2018 Mr. Hammond sold the company to a group reportedly financed by his old employer, Goldman Sachs. In 2012, Mr. Hammond became a 49% owner of Ace Distributing, a beverage distribution company located in southern central Pennsylvania, where has supported management through its technology initiatives and transformative acquisition. In 2017, Mr. Hammond also enabled Ace’s transformative acquisition of a competing distributor, W&L;, which doubled the number of cases sold and increased Ace’s market share in its territories to more than 60 percent. In 2019, Mr. Hammond founded Hammond Beverage Group to build upon the success of Ace and its strong management team. In 2019, Mr. Hammond founded Emles Advisors LLC, an asset management firm. Film distributor In 2013, Gabriel Hammond produced Learning to Drive, directed by Isabel Coixet, with his brother Daniel Hammond. The film stars Patricia Clarkson, Ben Kingsley, Jake Weber and Sarita Choudhury and won the audience award at the Provincetown International Film Festival and People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. He also produced Break Point, a film starring Jeremy Sisto, David Walton, Amy Smart and J.K. Simmons. In 2014 he established Broad Green Pictures with his brother Daniel Hammond. The company was originally set up as a production company, but the brothers realized that in order to keep control of the film, it was necessary to handle the distribution internally and began building the production company into a fully integrated studio. After nearly thirty films, Broad Green Pictures stopped distributing movies in 2018. The studio’s library of films includes A Walk in the Woods, Knight of Cups, The Infiltrator, Bad Santa 2 (a co-production with Miramax), along with both Terrence Malick’s Voyage of Time and Song to Song.

The PBS NOVA National Geographic film, in one episode of two hours, was directed and produced by Graham Townsley. The film describes the 2013 discovery, and later excavation, of the fossil remains of Homo naledi, an extinct species of hominin assigned to the genus Homo, found within the Dinaledi Chamber of the Rising Star Cave system, located in the Cradle of Humankind, South Africa. Additionally, the National Geographic Society has multiple videos on its website covering different phases of the discovery and excavation of the fossils during a two-year period. , fossils of at least fifteen individuals, amounting to 1550 specimens, have been excavated from the cave. Participants The documentary film is narrated by Jay O. Sanders and includes the following participants (alphabetized by last name): * Rebecca R.

But you don’t often encounter one that’s thrilling. Yet that is a fitting adjective for Dawn of Humanity, a program... that brings an aura of breaking news to a field that can often seem musty.\\" Brooke Cain of the Charlotte Observer reports that the documentary features \\"exclusive footage of the hair-raising descent deep into a nearly inaccessible cave to retrieve more than 1,500 hominid fossils.\\" According to archaeologist K. Kris Hirst, Dawn of Humanity provides \\"a rich context for the discovery [of the fossils of Homo naledi], setting the historical and evolutionary background so that viewers can understand the significance of the discovery.... [Lee] Berger's charming personality and the hordes of other paleontologists in this video make this contextual effort easily and visually accessible to the public.\\" In addition, according to Hirst, the behavior of apes in the \\"Dawn of Man\\" sequence of Stanley Kubrick film 2001: A Space Odyssey, largely influenced by the notions of Raymond Dart and Robert Ardrey, has been proven false since such violent apes have now been shown to be vegetarians instead.

Born in the St Pancras area of London to Jewish parents from Lithuania, Kaye's father died in the Spanish Flu epidemic when he was only five years old, and his mother brought up four children with support from Jewish charities.Aubrey Morris, \\"Obituary: Solly Kaye\\", The Guardian, 4 May 2005Jason L. Heppel, \\"Party recruitment: Jews and communism in Britain\\", in: Dark Times, Dire Decisions: Jews and Communism He left school at fourteen to work as a woodcarver, but lost his job as business was slow. He managed instead to find work for a furrier, although working conditions were very poor.Samantha Bird, Stepney, p.79 He took art lessons at the Bethnal Green Men's Institute, and was exhibited in Foyle's Gallery. In 1934, Kaye joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), initially through the National Unemployed Workers' Movement; he was present at the Battle of Cable Street, and gave speeches opposing the British Union of Fascists.Graham Stevenson, \\"Kaye Solly\\", Compendium of Communist Biography Kaye was soon appointed as CPGB branch secretary for Hackney and, as a result, he decided not to volunteer for the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War.Samantha Bird, Stepney, p.133 He married Margaret Johnson in 1945 having walked her home for five successive nights and proposing to her on a park bench on the fifth. They had three children - Jan, Johnny and Johanna. Kaye became involved in protests against slum landlords. Although initially he experienced hostility from the church, he gradually won them over; the Franscican Neville Palmer declared that \\"it is not a sin to vote for Solly Kaye\\" and John Groser claimed that \\"Solly Kaye is the one remaining prophet of the Lord amid all the prophets of Baal on Stepney Council\\". In 1963, Kaye disguised himself to attend the auction of Eileen Mansions, a tenement in Whitechapel. Once inside, he threatened that anyone who bought the property would experience trouble from him and the tenants, and the property did not sell. This won over anti-communist priest Joe Williamson, who thereafter recommended that his parishioners should vote for Kaye.\\"Solly Kaye\\", Church Times, 2 November 2006 Kaye stood for election in Stepney at the 1955 general election and again in 1959, 1964, 1966 and 1970, taking six to eight percent of the vote on each occasion. However, he was elected to Stepney Borough Council, holding his seat for fifteen years; in later years, on its replacement, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. He also stood unsuccessfully for London County Council, and for the Greater London Council in 1964 and 1967, taking the party's best vote share in the city on each occasion, peaking at 10.7% on the second occasion.Graham Stevenson, \\"HISTORY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY – THE EARLY 1950s TO THE EARLY 1960s\\"\\"Greater London Council: Tower Hamlets\\", United Kingdom Election Results Alongside his council post, Kaye gave regular speeches in Finsbury Square, and worked as a copywriter, then later as a woodwork teacher at Acland Burghley School. From the mid-1970s, he came to believe that reform of the CPGB was needed, although he opposed its ultimately dissolution, in 1991. He spoke about the anti-fascist movement of the 1930s at events in the late 1980s, to counter the rise of the British National Party.Searchlight, nos.355-366, p.22He died in 2005.

It was dedicated to the Nation by Lieutenant General Ashok Singh, PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, ADC, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Command, Indian Army, on 24 August 2015. The Museum displays war exhibits which include vehicles and equipment captured during the course of operations in 1965 and 1971. The Jaisalmer War Museum, popularly known as JWM, has an Honour Wall engraved with the names of the Param Vir Chakra and Maha Vir Chakra gallantry award winners, two large Information Display Halls - Indian Army Hall and Laungewala Hall, an Audio Visual Room, a souvenir shop and a cafeteria. A Hunter Aircraft of the Indian Air Force, which destroyed enemy tank columns during the Battle of Laungewala is also displayed. The Jaisalmer War Museum is located 10 km short of Jaisalmer on the Jaisalmer - Jodhpur Highway. The inauguration of the Museum took place in the Golden Jubilee Commemoration Year of the 1965 India Pakistan War.  Concept  The Jaisalmer War Museum was conceptualised to display India's rich military history and showcase real war efforts as they happened in the past. The Jaisalmer War Museum aims to promote greater awareness of the sacrifice made by heroes of the Indian Army, in particular, and Indian Armed Forces in general.  Chronology  The idea of establishing a War Museum at Jaisalmer in the state of Rajasthan was mooted by Lieutenant General Bobby Mathews, AVSM, VSM, General Officer Commanding, Konark Corps, with a view to showcase India's military history and war time experiences. Jaisalmer district was chosen for its rich martial traditions and for being witness to numerous battles including the famous Battle of Laungewala in 1971. The task of constructing and setting up the Jaisalmer War Museum on an area of flat, barren ground, within the Jaisalmer Military Station, was subsequently undertaken by the Desert Corps of the Indian Army, under the guidance of Lieutenant Mathews.  Laungewala Hall  The Laungewala Hall The Hall showcases the progression of the Battle of Laungewala as it took place on the night of 4 December 1971. The Hall also displays Indian Army operations on Eastern and Western Sectors during Indo-Pak War 1971.

The current structure of the church was built in 2012 during the tenure of Fr. James Dsouza. The original structure was constructed near the site of the present-day church building. It is the one of the oldest churches in Belthangady. This parish comes under Belthangady Varado which is a part of Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore. History Old church structure which was built around 1894 and demolished in December 2012 This first structure of the church came into existence around 1885 and the current church is the 3rd structure. The other two older structures were demolished. In 1682, when Maratha King Sambhaji invaded Goa, some Catholic families fled from Bardez in Goa, to a place called Gaddai, Athyadka and began residing there. In about 1870, Fr. Vaz constructed a chapel here. Originally a part of Agrar Church, the chapel was served from there. During the Goa-Verapoly controversy, some families seceded from Agrar Church and built a small chapel at Gaddai, a village at the foot of the rock fortress Jamalabad. As Athyadka was malaria-prone, the chapel was abandoned in 1890. Fr. Pascal Mascarenhas constructed a thatched chapel at Belthangady. It was pulled down to make way for a stable structure and a temporary church built adjoining the presbytery served for nearly 10 years. This was served from Taccode for some time. There were many Christian officers at Belthangady who helped Fr. Mascarenhas to get a plot. In 1908, Fr. Piadade D’Souza constructed a new church. Fr. Clifford Dsouza constructed the new parochial house in 1982. Fr. Gregory Dsouza built a chapel at Charmadi. On 10 August 1939, Fr. John G. Pinto established a chapel at Bangady(Indubettu), which became a parish later. Arva(Aladangady), Indubettu and Naravi parishes were carved out of Belthangady. Fr. Rosario Fernandes extended the church. The centenary celebrations were held during 1985 when Fr. Henry Machado was the parish priest. As the 2nd church building was more than hundred year old and too small to accommodate the present population, the parish assembly had decided to construct the new spacious church together with presbytery and a belfry. The estimated cost of the project is rupees 3 crore rupees. The post-centenary silver jubilee of Holy Redeemer Parish was held on the same day with inauguration of the present church building. Being located near Jamalabad Fort, built by Mysore ruler Tippu Sultan, this church has a history of more than 125 years. It is a testimony of Christians who sustained faith despite the atrocities of Tippu Sultan. The martyrdom of around eight hundred Christians inspired the faithful to lead a life centered on Christian values. The struggle of Christians and attacks on Churches by Tippu Sultan is now hidden from history due to political reasons to show Tippu Sultan as a hero in southern part of Karnataka. Demographics The parish has 622 families with a population of 2,902 members as of September 2011. Significance St. Theresa High School was begun by Fr. Elias P. Dias on 1 June 1965. The nuns of Ursuline Franciscan Congregation are teaching at St. Theresa Composite Pre University College that belonged to the parish with student strength of 638 and 31 teachers. They are also engaged in social service, helping the poor, and counselling the troubled families. St. Theresa High School also run by the same nuns of Ursuline Franciscan Congregation. Fr. John G. Pinto started a primary school at Belthangady. Fr. Rosario Fernandes constructed the new school building in 1949. Holy Redeemer Kannada Medium School has a student's strength of 750 and English Medium School has 210. The community gathering, ward-wise programmes that are organized regularly in the parish strengthen the parishioners' bond. The institutions run under this parish are one of the top in Belthangady. The parish has units of Catholic Sabha, Franciscan Third Order, Pompeii Sodality, rice fund, wedding fund, burial fund, St Vincent de Paul Society, YCS, Legion of Mary, Choir group, Altar boys and also self-help groups promoted by the parish to empower the financially weaker parishioners. The papal envoy to Ivory Coast, Archbishop Dr Ambrose Madtha, who died in an accident at Ivory Coast, were buried in the church on 15 December 2012, with nearly 3,500 people in attendance. The funeral mass was led by Apostolic Nuncio of India Salvatore Pennacchio with bishop of Mangalore Dr. Aloysius Paul Dsouza as the concelebrant. Administration 23 priests had served Belthangady parish till 2015. Among them Fr. Albert Pinto served the parish for 16 years and reached out to Malayali parishioners living in far-flung villages of Charmadi, Neriya, Thotattady and neighbouring villages and covered several miles on bicycle in order to serve their spiritual needs by offering Holy Mass in Malayalam. Fr. Elias P. Dias was a zealous priest who served the parish for seven years. He opened St. Theresa Girls High School as he believed that women empowerment begins with education. The nuns of the Ursuline Franciscan Congregation were entrusted with the duties of managing the school. Later St. Theresa Girls High School changed to co-education and changed the name to St. Theresa High School. Fr. E. P. Dias was the first priest at the newly set up parish in Ujire, about 6 km from Belthangady parish, and instrumental in setting up Anugraha Education Institution in Ujire. Fr. Victor Pinto was the first assistant priest appointed by diocesan authorities in 1960. Fr. Lawrence Dsouza served as 21st parish priest and during his time Fr.

Built in 1807, it is a remarkably high-quality Federal period house built in what was then a frontier area. The house is now owned by the Machiasport Historical Society, which uses it as its headquarters and museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Gates House is located between Port Road and the Machias River in the village center of Machiasport, a short way south of Liberty Hall. It is set on a steeply sloping lot directly on the bank of the river, presenting two stories to the street and three to the river. It is an L-shaped wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboard siding. The main entrance is set near the crook of the L, flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature. Windows are small-paned sash, with minimally decorative surrounds, and there are three chimneys. The interior has seen much alteration over the building's history, and only the first floor room layout approximates the original configuration. There are no fireplaces. When the house was built in 1807, it was one of the few houses in the immediate area. It was probably built by Nathaniel Phinney, Sr., and was purchased by Nathan Gates in 1813. Gates operated wharves adjacent to the house, which became a transshipment point for lumber arriving on the Whitneyville Railroad and sent to market via coasting schooners. The house remained in the hands of the Gates family until 1929. In 1966 it was acquired by the Machiasport Historical Society, which uses it as its headquarters and museum.

Students form two concentric circles and take turns on rotation to face new partners to answer or discuss the teacher’s questions. This method can be used to gather variety of information, generate new ideas and solve problems.  Process of the strategy  In the inside-outside circle strategy, the teacher poses a particular question or a problem to the students. The teacher's role is to facilitate and guide discussions. The teacher divides the class into two equal groups. The inner circle is formed by one of the groups and the other group forms an outer circle. Students in the inside circle stand facing the students in the outside circle. The teacher poses a particular question to the students. The students are given some time to think about it. Then, each student in the inner circle is given time to share their opinions about the question with his or her partner of the outside circle and vice versa. On the teacher’s signal, the students take one step to their left in the outside circle and have another quick discussion with their new partner. The teacher gives adequate time for the students to take down new ideas and information in their notebooks.  Advantages  * It provides opportunities for classroom interaction and physical movement in class. * It is an effective way to develop communication skills.Educator resources * Students pair up and share their ideas. This facilitates working with different students of the class to gather information. * The students are actively involved in discussions throughout the class.

Considered to be the first controllable fighting game character whose moveset is centered on grappling, he made his first appearance in Street Fighter II: The World Warrior in 1991. In the series, he is a professional wrestler that fights to prove Russia's superiority over other nations' fighters. Conception and creation Designed by Akira Yasuda, Zangief was initially conceived for Street Fighter II as a character named \\"Vodka Gobalsky\\", planned to be a very strong but extremely slow character to play as. Early designs of the character closely resembled the character's finalized appearance, but with the addition of a black tanktop and anchor tattoo on his upper arms. In an interview with Game On!, Capcom Research and Development head Noritaka Funamizu stated that of the series' characters, Zangief was one of the most popular characters with American audiences, alongside Ryu and Guile. Zangief appears as a tall, muscular man clad in red wrestling tights and boots, a studded gold belt, and red/gold wristbands. His brown hair is cut in a short Mohawk style, and he has a beard/mustache and a large amount of hair on his chest. His arms and legs are covered with scars. His appearance is similar to real life professional wrestler Ivan Koloff. Portrayal Various actors have voiced the character in his video game appearances: he is voiced by Wataru Takagi in the Street Fighter Alpha and Street Fighter EX series, Tesshō Genda in the Capcom vs. SNK series and Capcom Fighting Evolution, and Kenta Miyake in Japanese and Peter Beckman in English for Street Fighter IV. In anime, he is voiced in Japanese by Tetsuo Kanao and in English by William Johnson. In the live-action Street Fighter film, the character was portrayed by Andrew Bryniarski, who was dubbed over by Ryūzaburō Ōtomo in the Japanese television dub and by Katsuhisa Hōki in the video and DVD dub. In the film Wreck-It Ralph, he was voiced by director Rich Moore. Zangief also appears as a playable character in Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix. Appearances in other media Zangief appeared in Masaomi Kanzaki's Street Fighter manga, which was released in the early 1990s. In his depiction in the comic, he was depicted very much like his video game self. One of his main motivations was to defeat Guile, who as an American, represented the rival country of Zangief's homeland, but found himself coming up short in their battles. In more recent adaptations, Zangief is shown to interact more with Ryu, either as an enemy or ally, and his win quotes in Street Fighter IV imply that it was Ryu who knocked him out of the second tournament. Zangief appears in Masahiko Nakahira's Sakura Ganbaru! manga, in which he is introduced fighting in his exact same stage from Street Fighter Alpha 2. He first defeats Blanka, and then is engaged by Sakura and Cammy, whom he easily overpowered. He was later defeated by the duo and his friendly and good natured personality soon surfaced. He appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting Street Fighter X Tekken, with his official tag partner, Rufus. Zangief appears as a Spirit in the Nintendo crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. After the player defeats Incineroar from Pokémon and rescue Zangief's spirit, they have access to a dojo where he can teach other spirits the \\"Overthrow\\" style. =Film and anime= Zangief appears in almost every Street Fighter movie adaptation to date, save for Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li. In Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, Zangief appears very briefly during a brutal battle against Blanka to entertain an audience of crime bosses, where he is electrocuted by him, though his fate afterwards is unknown. In Street Fighter II V, he is a henchman for Shadaloo, and sent by M. Bison to capture Ryu, whom he had seen displaying talents of Hadou on a beach earlier. Ryu resists, and they fight for a while until Zangief manages to knock him out. As they are leaving, Zangief spots Guile watching them from afar, and later on, while Guile and Nash are infiltrating Bison's base, Zangief corners Guile with the intention of killing him under Bison's orders. Guile and Zangief fight until Guile manages to knock Zangief out with a severe blow to the head. He is not seen again after for the rest of the anime, leaving his fate unknown when the base is destroyed after Ryu and Ken defeat Bison. In Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation, he appears as a competitor in a fighting tournament. He fights Shun, Ryu's alleged little brother, and begins to ruthlessly beat the boy until Ryu intervenes and battles Zangief. Zangief appears to have the upper hand, but Ryu, in his rage, almost gives in to the Dark Hadō and fires a lethal dark Hadōken which narrowly misses Zangief but causes the building to collapse. Zangief, stunned by Ryu's power, subsequently falls through the crumbling floor. In the live- action Street Fighter movie, Zangief is portrayed by Andrew Bryniarski. He is once again a lackey of Bison's, only this time he has a good heart (though he is extremely simple-minded) and truly believes Bison's propaganda that the A.N. are the enemies of world peace and freedom. Zangief gives Ryu and Ken their signature white and red gis, which are actually training uniforms for Bison's men. During the climactic battle, Zangief battles E. Honda. After the battle ends, he is told by Dee Jay that Bison was in fact the enemy and had been fooling Zangief the whole time. To redeem himself, Zangief helps Ryu and Ken hold the emergency exit door open for the hostages to escape. He is last seen complementing Guile's bravery and gives him the Bison salute, which Guile turns into a thumbs-up. =Other= Zangief makes an appearance in the 2012 Walt Disney film Wreck-It Ralph, voiced by the film's director Rich Moore. He and M. Bison are among the game characters present at a meeting of \\"Bad-Anon\\", a villain support group, when Wreck-It Ralph decides to attend. Ralph later finds a pair of Zangief's tights in the lost-and-found box at Tapper's bar and reacts with disgust. Zangief appears again in the 2018 sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet where Ralph and Vanellope wonder how he only has hair on his chest, shins and face, and later at the end he attends a book club with Ralph, Sonic and Q*Bert. Strangely, despite appearing at \\"Bad-Anon\\", he is not a villain in his own video game series, although fellow \\"Bad-Anon\\" attendee M. Bison is an antagonist. Zangief was featured in ScrewAttack's internet series Death Battle. He fought Mike Haggar from Final Fight in a hypothetical match and won thanks to his greater size and youth as well as the animals he usually spars with which are brown bears where as his opponents spars with bull sharks that are considered less dangerous. In the indie game Punch Club, a Russian fighter named Ivangief shares the same appearance as Zangief. Reception Zangief placed 18th in the Top 50 Characters of 1996 poll in the Gamest magazine in Japan. IGN ranked Zangief at 13th place in their list of top Street Fighter characters, stating \\"he's a bit of a stereotype, a hulking lug from Mother Russia, but he plays the type so well, though. Between the Mohawk, the muttonchops, and the all-over bear-wrestling scars, it is hard to imagine a more perfect embodiment of the muscle-bound grappling goon.\\"Top 25 Street Fighter Characters - Day III.

GameDaily. Retrieved on 13 November 2008 UGO Networks placed Zangief at number five on their list of top Street Fighter characters, stating \\"Zangief can be an intimidating character to play because he is far slower than other competitors; however, he makes up for that in his ability to close range quickly and bypass and counter projectiles from his opponents.\\" WhatCulture ranked him first on its list of top 10 Street Fighter characters of all time due to his \\"chest bigger than the sun and a beard to make Chuck Norris jealous.\\" Zangief's appearance in the first polygonal Street Fighter game, Street Fighter EX, was widely criticized. Ed Lomas of Computer and Video Games ridiculed his \\"big square box-head\\" and GameSpot said he was the only one of the established Street Fighter characters in the game who didn't closely resemble his original 2D depiction. Next Generation said both the big characters in the game, Zangief and Darun, had awful polygonal models though they were very well-animated.

It is a historical and cultural monument of federal significance in Russia. The building was created in 1934–1937 by prominent Russian architects Andrey Kryachkov and Vitaly Maslennikov. History The building was originally conceived as a high-profile residential complex for the Soviet elite and arranged for 100 well-appointed apartments (hence the name). The initial project included 10 five-bedroom suits, 30 four-bedroom suits, 40 three- bedroom flats, and 20 two-bedroom flats. The flats have a well-designed layout, large living and utility rooms; some suits had small rooms for maids. Construction of the house began in 1934. The initial exterior design was substantially complicated in the process, for architect Maslennikov added facade elements themed after the works of French architect Auguste Perret. At the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in Paris on December 11, 1937, the project, along with other works by Kryachkov, was awarded the 1st degree diploma, a gold medal, and a Grand Prix. Currently, there are 110 apartments in the building, not 100. In 2008, a monument to Kryachkov was erected in front of the building. Notable residents In various years there lived Gersh Budker (physicist), Eugeny Meshalkin (cardiologist), Vladimir Mysh (surgeon), Alexander Tikhonov (biathlete), Yevgeny Mravinsky (conductor), Nikolai Cherkasov (actor), Nikolai Simonov (actor), Vasili Merkuryev (actor). Kryachkov himself, contrary to the popular opinion, never lived in the building.

National Television), is the national television network of Sri Lanka. Established by Parliament under Act No. 6 of 1982 for the provision of a national television service, it produces and broadcasts programmes in three languages. Distinguished civil servant M.J Perera was the founder chairman of Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. SLRC is the largest television broadcaster in Sri Lanka and has an island-wide reception of its channels. SLRC broadcasts its channels in both VHF and UHF frequencies in Sri Lanka. Currently, all of the network's services are only available by analog transmission. But there are plans to upgrade to digital broadcasting. From 2011 Kokavil transmitting starts DVB-T2 for the North area in Sri Lanka. There were plans to transmit the DVB-T2 Digital Transmission all over the country in 2015. The existing analog transmission will be completely cut off. History Rūpavāhinī was created under a government act on January 23, 1982 and established on February 14 the same year. Rupavahini began broadcasting on February 15, 1982, one day after it was established, with an opening speech from J. R. Jayewardene, Sri Lanka's president at the time. Funding was donated by the Japanese government. Both transmitters were built and installed by Japanese technicians. In 1986, Rupavahini expanded their facilities and, in 1998, rehabilitated most of the original equipment using digital technology under three grant aid projects from the Government of Japan. Its studio complex is in Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka. The complex comprises a master control room, four studios, two dubbing studios, a digital post-production unit, two analogue post-production units, several editing suites including non-linear editing, and four outside broadcast vehicles. 'Rupavahini 2' launched in April 1999 before it changed its name to the current 'Channel Eye' in August 2000. On January 1, 2008, Channel Eye became a timeshared channel, altering with the newly created Nethra TV. In 2009, series of Rupavahini productions available in DVD and VCD formats under the title \\"RU Entertainments\\". Rupavahini is the first Sri Lankan channel to telecast foreign teledramas. The most popular of them was Oshin, which was a Japanese teledrama dubbed with Sinhala. In December 2014, the main channel was made available via satellite to Europe (via Eutelsat 70B), prompting the channel to temporarily go 24/7 (still doing the formal start and end of transmission routines) to alleviate time zone differences. Due to unknown reasons, the channel was removed. The channel now starts shortly before 04:00 and ends shortly after midnight.  Sister channels  Currently the SLRC operates three channels. *Rupavahini is the main channel, in Sinhala. It transmits on a 20-hour schedule and features news, teledramas, educational programming, discussion shows, and imported programming. *Channel Eye is the English language and sports channel. The channel's name is derived from its three focal points: Education, Youth, and Entertainment. The channel airs a wide range of original productions and sporting events. In the first years of Channel Eye, it telecast documentaries of Discovery Channel and international and local sport programs, mainly cricket, volleyball, and motorcar racing. Channel Eye became the official TV broadcaster for five Cricket World Cup tournaments: 1996, 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015. *Nethra TV (nethra is Tamil for \\"eye\\") is the Tamil language channel started in 2008. Initially, it was broadcast on Channel Eye's frequencies between 07:30 and 21:00. Since February 20, 2018 it has its own frequencies separate from Channel Eye. The channel focuses on Tamil culture and customs with original and acquired programming, including Tamil serials. It also airs an amount of religious programming, especially aimed at the religious minorities. *Between 2009 and 2015, a fourth channel, NTV, was operated by the corporation. It aired contents entirely in English and was known to be a \\"worthless\\" channel upon its launch by critics. Eventually, NTV was shut down owing to low ratings. Management and funding Rupavahini is an autonomous corporation run by a chairman, director general, and a board of directors appointed by the president. Until 1998 there was a subscription system to earn funds: Every television owner with VHF reception had to pay the government a yearly fee. After a parliament act, programming and broadcasts funding was made by television advertising and government grants. Logo Rupavahini's logo is a hill mynah carrying a message in gold on a red TV screen. It is generally accompanied by the channel's name in Sinhala, Tamil, and a transliteration of Sinhala, with macrons (RŪPAVĀHINĪ). The leaf was incorporated into NTV's previous symbol and is incorporated into trophies held at award shows organized by the corporation, the Ape Gamana logo, and the SLRC's news operation.

It is a Grade I listed building and stands in an elevated position in Church Street. The present building is thought to be on the site of an earlier place of worship. The majority of the existing structure was erected between the 12th and 14th centuries, the walls being constructed of limestone with ashlar dressings. The spire reaches the height of 202 feet (61.5m) and is the second tallest in Northamptonshire. The bowl of the 13th-century circular font is decorated with a carving of a ram's head. A brass on the floor commemorates John Tawyer (died 1470) and his wife Margaret. There is a tomb-chest dedicated to John Wales, vicar from 1447 to 1496. In the south chapel are monuments to Robert Gage (died 1606) and William Gage of Magilligan, Ireland (died 1632). A number of other substantial monuments and also medieval wall paintings survive within the building. The church features a rare 'left-handed fiddler' decoration above the western entrance. Until the 15th century the dedication of the church was to St Mary but the dedication now used is to St Peter. The interior was restored in 1874 and 1878 by Sir Gilbert Scott; this involved the removal of a west gallery and alterations to the chancel. The three-manual organ was built by Peter Conacher and was one of the largest organs by Conacher of Huddersfield.

In addition to its architectural significance, the area is also noted for its association with the author Kate Douglas Wiggin, whose home, Quillcote, is in the district, as is the Salmon Falls Library, established by her efforts in 1911. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Salmon Falls area, divided between Buxton and Hollis by the Saco River, developed beginning in the late 18th century as a modest agricultural area, and the falls on the river, for which it is named, were developed in the second quarter of the 19th century with small scale industrial operations. The road that is now Maine State Route 117 was the main road in the area leading north from the port of Saco, and became the focus for development on the Buxton side of the village. One of the first settlers on the west side of the River, Isaac Lane, paid to have a bridge built across the river (roughly now the location of United States Route 202) c. 1794. The area saw growth in the second quarter of the 19th century, but declined economically thereafter, limiting further development. The historic district covers about , and extends along Salmon Falls Road north from its junction with US 202, including only the Salmon Falls Library on the south side of that road. The oldest houses in the district are those of Isaac Lane and Jabez Bradbury, both built in the 1790s. The former is a well-preserved Federal style wood frame house, while the latter, now also known as the Kate Douglas Wiggin House or \\"Quillcote\\", has been significantly altered with the addition of a Greek Revival ell. Most of the remaining houses are 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 story wood frame houses built in the 1820s, with Greek Revival styling. There is one brick house, the Moses Dunn House, built in the 1830s, which occupies a picturesque site overlooking the Saco River. The Salmon Falls Library is located in the district's only surviving non-residential building, built as a shop in the 1820s, and converted into a kindergarten and library by Kate Douglas Wiggin and her sister Nora Smith in 1911. Kate Douglas Wiggin was a noted writer of children's books. First exposed to the Salmon Falls area as a child, she purchased the Jabez Bradbury House in 1905 (it was the ancestral home of her stepfather), which became her home for the rest of her life. The library she and her sister founded was given to the town upon their deaths.

He was best known as the leader of the 1857 Chinese Uprising against the White Rajah James Brooke. History A Hakka born in Lufeng, Guangdong of the Qing dynasty, around 1800, Liu left for Sambas, Borneo, at the age of 20. He is said to have worked at the Sam Tiau Kow gold mine there until mistreatment by the Dutch caused him to lead a group of miners to the Bau area of SarawakChang Pat Foh, (1995), Liu Shanbang (The Hero who refused to be ruled by the White Rajah), pp.78-82 in \\"The Land of Freedom Fighters\\" (perhaps Pangkalan Tebang). He organised the 'Twelve Kongsi' company which operated the Mau San gold mine and made the mining town of Mau San (or Bau Lama) effectively self- governing.Kaur, Amarjit (February 1995) \\"The Babbling Brookes: Economic Change in Sarawak 1841-1941\\" Modern Asian Studies 29(1): pp. 65-109, p.73. They unearthed gold deposits and turned Mau San into a prosperous and thriving gold town. Events alledgedly took a wrong turn when The White Rajah, James Brooke, imposed high taxes on the gold mine business. =Revolt and massacre= On 18 February 1857, Liu Shan Bang led 600 Chinese rebels by the Sarawak River to attack the White Rajah in Kuching. Unknown to the rebels, Brooke fled from his home and dived into the Kuching River to emerge to the other side. Five Europeans were killed, properties including Brooke's house were burnt, and the town in disarray, with most Europeans sheltering in the grounds of the Anglican Church. The rebels mistook a 17 year-old boy as the White Rajah, beheaded him and paraded his head on a pole around the town. However, the insurgents did not want to assume the government; they offered it to Helms the manager of the Borneo Company and another trader called Ruppell, with the Datu Bandar administering the Malays, and withdrew upriver. Liu also sat on the White Rajah's seat. =Death= However, only a day later, Liu had discovered that the White Rajah was still alive. In retaliation, Brooke enlisted the help of his Malay supporters, while his nephew Charles Brooke sailed from Lingga with a force of Iban soldiers. On 23 February Charles led a force of Ibans to join up with the local Bidayuh tribes in pursuit of Liu and his rebels. The following day, while on the way back to Bau, Liu and his rebels were under attack by the Rajah’s Iban forces. Liu managed to regroup at Jugan in Siniawan, but was heavily outnumbered. There Liu was shot dead and his rebels were killed. Charles' Iban forces pursued the remaining rebels to Bau, where they slaughtered the 3,000 villagers including women, children and old folks in a massacre and left their bodies to rot. Legacy A stone was placed to mark his grave, and a small temple erected by it, although the reason was kept secret for over a century.Chang Pat Foh, (1995), Bau Chinese Rebellion 1857, pp.44-57 in \\"The Land of Freedom Fighters\\"The Bau Chinese Insurgence 1857http://worshipdevotion.blogspot.co.uk/2008/01/bau-chinese- insurgence-1857.html Liu was elevated by the community to a deity named “Shin”.A Chinese Rajah — Story of Liu Shan Banghttps://www.newsarawaktribune.com.my/news/a-chinese-rajah-story-of-liu- shan-bang/?amp On 27 July 1993, Liu Shanbang was included in the 'freedom fighters, liberators, and martyrs' unveiled on the new Heroes' Monument in the Sarawak Museum Garden.

It bills itself as \\"The Mid-South's Best Alternative Newspaper\\". The Defender was founded in 1951 by John H. Sengstacke, owner of the Chicago Defender. In 2013, the paper was locally purchased from Real Times Media by Best Media Inc.  History  Sengstacke's Chicago Defender circulated widely across the Southern United States, but Sengstacke in the early 1950s identified Memphis as a particularly attractive market, where several African-American newspapers had failed to take root and a startup would face only one competitor, The Memphis World, which had begun in 1931 (and would continue publishing until 1961). In November 1951, Sengstacke and editor Lewis O. Swingler, the former editor of the World, published the first edition of the Tri-State Defender, adopting the slogan \\"The South's Independent Weekly\\". The 20-page inaugural edition included \\"The Tri-State Defender Ten Point Program\\", consisting of vows \\"to broadcast to the world the achievements of all the citizens it serves\\", \\"to join hands with all citizens regardless of creed or color who wish to develop better human relations and to advance the principals of American Democracy\\", and \\"to uphold those Christian principles which under gird our republic\\", among others. Swingler served as editor in chief until 1955. Tri-State Defender journalists led coverage of the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, an African-American teen from Illinois who was killed in Mississippi after allegedly flirting with a white woman. Their stories and photographs dominated both their own paper and the Chicago Defender for weeks, and the trial became a media sensation and landmark event in the Civil Rights Movement. In the 1950, L. Alex Wilson served as the editor of the Tri-State Defender, and with his coverage of the enveloping Civil Rights Movement had a more powerful editorial influence than its competitor, The Memphis World, on the Memphis black community.The Invisible Press, The Jackson Sun, Dylan T. Lovan, 2003, retrieved June 7, 2016 The Tri-State Defender in its first 50 years was part of Sengstacke Enterprises Inc., a chain of prominent African-American publications, which in the 1990s included the flagship Chicago Daily Defender, the Michigan Chronicle and the New Pittsburgh Courier. Following Sengstacke's death in 1997, the four-paper chain was held in a family trust until 2003, when it was sold for nearly $12 million to Real Times, a group of investors with several business and family ties to Sengstacke.

The Philadelphia Tribune is the oldest continuously published African-American newspaper in the United States. Page footer says \\"© Copyright, African American Registry, 2000 to 2013\\". The paper began in 1884 when Christopher J. Perry published its first copy. Throughout its history, The Philadelphia Tribune has been committed to the social, political, and economic advancement of African Americans in the Greater Philadelphia region. During a time when African Americans struggled for equality, the Tribune acted as the \\"Voice of the black community\\" for Philadelphia. Historian V. P. Franklin asserted that the Tribune \\"was (and is) an important Afro-American cultural institution that embodied the predominant cultural values of upper-, middle-, and lower-class Black Philadelphians.\\" In the early 21st century, the paper is headquartered at 520 South 16th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It publishes on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. The Philadelphia Tribune also publishes the Tribune Magazine, Entertainment Now, Sojourner, The Learning Key, and The Sunday Tribune. The Tribune has a weekly readership of about 625,000, and is mostly read by people living in the Philadelphia–Camden Metro Area, as well as in Chester. The Tribune has received the John B. Russwurm award as \\"Best Newspaper\\" in the country seven times since 1995.  Christopher James Perry  Christopher J. Perry was born on September 11, 1854 in Baltimore, Maryland to free people of color. Perry attended school in Baltimore, gaining a positive reputation in his local community through his public speeches. After he graduated from high school in 1873, the ambitious Perry migrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, feeling there were more opportunities in the northern city, given the waning days of Reconstruction in the South. Once in Philadelphia, Perry began writing for local newspapers such as the Northern Daily and the Sunday Mercury. He wrote a column titled, \\"Flashes and Sparks\\" for the Mercury, which provided information to the growing black community in Philadelphia. Other migrants from the South were also settling there. Through his regular columns, Perry gained positive attention from the educated members of the African-American community in Philadelphia. However, in 1884, the Sunday Mercury went bankrupt and Perry was without a job. Later that year on November 27, 1884, Perry began his own newspaper entitled The Philadelphia Tribune. He ran the operation as the owner, reporter, editor, copier, and advertiser. Perry worked on the Tribune until his death in 1921. Throughout his career with the Tribune, Perry promoted the advancement of African Americans in society and covered issues affecting their daily lives.  History  = Beginnings = An image from Garland Penn's book The Afro- American Press and Its Editors When the Tribune began publication in 1884, it was a weekly, one-page paper, publishing from 725 Sansom Street. Despite the challenges black businesses faced during the late nineteenth century, especially in journalism, the Tribune enjoyed unusual success during its early years, and it averaged 3,225 copies weekly by 1887. In 1891, Perry and the Tribune received national recognition when Garland Penn, a prominent advocate for African-American journalism, praised the Philadelphia newspaper in his book The Afro-American Press and Its Editors. In his book, Penn complimented the Tribune's consistency and reliability. However, the Tribune was not the only African-American newspaper circulating in Philadelphia at the time. The Tribune competed against other African-American newspapers during its first few decades, such as The Philadelphia Standard Echo, The Philadelphia Sentinel, The Philadelphia Defender, and The Courant. But by 1900, the Tribune became the leading voice of Black Philadelphia, and W. E. B. Du Bois referred to it as \\"the chief news-sheet\\" in the city. = Post-Reconstruction migration = After Reconstruction ended in 1877, many African Americans from the South migrated to northern cities in search of a better life. The city went through a fundamental transformation as African Americans flooded the city looking for jobs. Racial tensions divided Philadelphia as the new black migrants crowded neighborhoods and competed with Whites for jobs, including Irish immigrants and, increasingly, other European immigrants. During the migration, Perry and The Tribune served as an outlet to educate and inform black Philadelphians, and it helped the new migrants adjust to their new city. It covered job openings, civic affairs, social events, and church news. Rather than just report the news, the Tribune committed itself to helping to improve the standard of living for African Americans in Philadelphia. The Tribune openly supported and advertised civic groups such as The Armstrong Association, Negro Migration Committee, and the National Urban League of Philadelphia in order to combat the increasing discrimination found within the city. = Great Migration = Great Migration urban populations Beginning about 1910, a new wave of black migrants moved to Philadelphia, as part of the Great Migration from the rural South to northern and midwestern industrial cities. The expansion of railroads drew many new workers. After World War I began, industries began to recruit blacks as whites were drafted into the military. The city was crowded and new migrants moved into white neighborhoods, resulting in violent reactions in working-class areas. White mobs formed to intimidate black families. In 1914, a white mob attacked and destroyed the new home of a black woman, but the Philadelphia Department of Public Safety failed to investigate the crime and no white newspapers reported the incident. The managing editor of the Tribune, G. Grant Williams, reported the case and encouraged African Americans to join the police force and become part of shaping the city. The newspaper worked with the Colored Protective Association to help defend African Americans who were unfairly arrested. Williams also wrote articles on how to protect community women from racial violence, as well as giving advice on morals and values. As a way to create a cultural identity and unity among blacks in the city, the Tribune publicized free lectures and invited respected church leaders to write columns for the paper. As white men left the city for war assignments in Europe, industrial jobs opened up for African Americans and the Tribune covered the job market. However, after the war ended in 1918, white veterans returned and competed fiercely with African Americans for jobs in the post-war recession. Racial riots broke out in the summer of 1919 in many industrial cities. Since White men appeared more qualified for work, the Tribune spent the 1920s encouraging African Americans to receive an education or learn a trade at an industrial school. By 1920, the Tribune was distributing 20,000 newspapers weekly and had earned a reputation as one of the top African-American newspapers in the country. In 1921, its founder and chief editor Christopher Perry died; he was succeeded by G. Grant Williams. Williams died in June 1922. Eugene Washington Rhodes became the managing editor, serving for more than two decades until 1944. Under Rhodes, the Tribune went through aesthetic enhancements as the print size and column size grew larger. Despite an increase in cost, the Tribune remained a hot seller. = The Great Depression and New Deal = In April 1929, months before the Stock Market Crash, Philadelphia's black unemployment rate was 45 percent higher than white unemployment. During the Great Depression, African Americans in Philadelphia and throughout the country suffered higher levels of unemployment due to their lack of skills and qualifications. Rhodes and the Tribune wrote articles to help African Americans improve their standard of living during the difficult times. The newspaper provided information on relief help by advertising black social organizations, churches, and schools. Also, by 1930, Tribune and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) of Philadelphia would report unfair employment practices by local businesses, and the negative publicity would pressure the businesses into reassessing their hiring process. When Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced his New Deal program in 1933, the Tribune covered the new federal relief agencies and exposed the discrimination some of the programs practiced against African Americans. Although Roosevelt and the New Deal aimed to assist struggling Americans, the Tribune faced a political dilemma. Historically, the Tribune had supported the Republican Party because of its ties to Abraham Lincoln and the Abolitionists. In order to keep Republicans in control of local and State politics, Rhodes and the Tribune remained loyal to the party of Lincoln and criticized Roosevelt and his Democratic Party. The confusing message the Tribune offered allowed other African-American newspapers in Philadelphia to gain readers. In 1935, the Philadelphia Independent openly supported Roosevelt and the Democrats, and surpassed the Tribune as the most popular African-American newspaper in Philadelphia with 30,000 weekly subscribers. In the mid-1930s, Rhodes introduced new elements to the paper as a way to gain more readers. He added an editorial that showcased African- American achievements and also a comic strip to the weekly paper. However, some argue Rhodes used these new elements to promote middle-class values that reflected the principles of the Republican Party. = Civil rights = During the 1920s, after John Asbury and Andrew Stevens became the first African Americans elected to the Pennsylvania State legislature, the Tribune increased its political activity in the city. In 1921, when the State legislature introduced an Equal Rights Bill, the Tribune reported which representatives opposed it. The paper remained a strong advocate for the bill until 1935, when Pennsylvania passed a state Equal Rights Bill. Also during the 1920s and 1930s, the Tribune played a monumental role in officially ending segregation in Philadelphia schools. Upset over the Philadelphia School Board's lack of action to end segregation, the Tribune organized the Defense Fund Committee in 1926. It collected funds to support a court challenge to the school board. By 1932, the Tribune succeeded in gaining appointment of African Americans to the School Board, which eventually ended segregation in Philadelphia's public schools. Thanks to the Tribunes coverage of and coalition with the NAACP, Philadelphia captured national attention in 1965 when demonstrators protested to end segregation at Girard College. It had been established as a high school to educate poor boys in the city but historically had admitted only whites. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Philadelphia, strengthening the city and the Tribunes connection to the national civil rights movement.

The range was established after the New York Legislature and the newly formed National Rifle Association (NRA) combined in 1872 to acquire 70 acres of farmland from a Mr Creed for long-distance rifle shooting and the holding of shooting competitions. The range officially opened on June 21, 1873.\\"America's Wimbledon: The Inauguration\\". The New York Times. June 22, 1873. p. 5.

The New York Times. June 12, 1873. p. 5. In 1873 the NRA and the Creedmoor range benefitted greatly from the substantial publicity created when the Irish Rifle team, in that year the British champions having won the Elcho Shield, challenged the NRA to a rifle shooting match at Creedmoor the following year. The Amateur Club accepted the challenge and won by a small margin. In 1874 the Leech Cup was presented to the Amateur Rifle Club by Major Arthur Blennerhassett Leech, Captain of the visiting Irish Rifle Team and is thus the oldest trophy offered today in competitive target shooting in the United States. It was presented to the NRA in 1901 and was then annually awarded for long distance shooting by any rifle. In 1875, the Wimbledon Cup was presented to the NRA by the British team on the occasion of their shooting at Wimbledon, then the home of British rifle shooting. It was then annually awarded for 1000-yard shooting. International competitions, organised by the NRA, were held annually at the range until 1891, after which a decline in interest and support caused them to be moved to the range at the National Guard Camp, Sea Girt, New Jersey under the auspices of the New Jersey State Rifle Association. The Creedmoor site reverted to the State of New York in 1907 and in 1912 became the Farm Colony of Brooklyn State Hospital. Today it is the site of the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center.

Designed by Thomas Slade, she was the prototype for six subsequent Infernal class bomb vessels which saw service in the Mediterranean and the West Indies during the Seven Years' War with France. In 1760 she was refitted as a sloop and returned to active service in the Caribbean.Winfield 2007, p.342 Infernal was paid off at the conclusion of the War in 1763, and sold out of Navy service in 1774.  Construction  Infernal was the first of seven bomb vessels designed by Surveyor of the Navy Thomas Slade to strengthen the Navy's shore bombardment capacity during the Seven Years' War. Admiralty Orders for her construction were issued on 5 October 1756, followed by a contract to master shipwright Henry Bird to build the vessel at the civilian dockyard in Northam, Southampton. The contract specified that Infernal should be ready for launch within six months in return for payment of £11.5.0 per ton burthen. While this time requirement was not met, Admiralty retained sufficient confidence in Bird's capacity that he was engaged to build a second vessel, , in 1759.Winfield 2007, pp. 342–343 Infernals dimensions were in keeping with other vessels of her class, with an overall length of , a beam of and measuring 307 tons burthen. Construction costs were ₤3,355 with an additional ₤2,082 for fitting out. Slade's design included a narrow stern, bluff bow and broad beam, creating a short, heavy vessel capable of supporting the recoil of the mortars. A consequence of this design was that her sailing qualities were very poor, as she lacked both speed and the ability to sail to close to the wind.MacLaughlan 2014, p. 209 Infernal was among the last bomb vessels to be built to a two-masted ketch rig design. Over the preceding decade the Navy Board had considered ways to improve the handling and seaworthiness of its bomb vessels, including using a three-masted ship rig instead of the ketch. To test this concept, the Board resolved that four Infernal-class bombs, including Infernal herself, would be ketch-rigged and the other three ship-rigged, and that their relative performance would determine future bomb vessel design.Ware 1994, pp. 42–44 She was initially equipped with eight six-pounder cannons for ship defence, and twelve -pounder swivel guns to ward off boarding parties. Slade's design specified that two mortars be installed, one capable of 10-inch shot and the other of 13-inch, for use against fortifications. The mortars were also capable of being loaded with around one hundred one-pound projectiles at a time, for use against enemy personnel. Bomb vessel construction ended on 11 July 1757, but by Admiralty Order the newly launched ship was immediately returned to Northam dockyard for refitting as a sloop. The mortars were removed and replaced with an additional six six-pounder cannons, and additional quarters constructed for an enlarged crew totaling 110 men. Naval service Infernal was commissioned into the Navy in July 1757, as a 14-gun sloop under Commander James Mackenzie. She was immediately attached to Admiral Edward Hawkes fleet for the capture of Île-d'Aix on 23 September, and the subsequent Raid on Rochefort. In April 1758 she was sailed to Portsmouth and restored to her original function as a bomb vessel at a cost of ₤884. Six of her cannons were removed and the original 10-inch and 13-inch mortars and were restored. Her crew was reduced to 60 men, though James Mackenzie retained his command. A unit of Army gunners was brought aboard to oversee the use of the mortars. In May 1758 she bombarded the French ports of St Malo and Cherbourg returning to Portsmouth in June. Disease had broken out on board, and a substantial part of the crew were offloaded to the Haslar Hospital, suffering from what surgeon James Lind described as \\"fevers of the most malignant kind.\\"Lind 1965, p. 111 Replacements having been found, Infernal returned to sea and was present at the Battle of Saint Cast in September. On 12 November she was assigned to service off the Leeward Islands as part of British plans to seize the French naval base at Martinique. In 1759 she engaged in bombardments of both Martinique and Guadeloupe, but her usefulness as a bomb vessel was hampered by Britain's defensive position in the Caribbean. By Admiralty Order, on 20 March 1760 she was again fitted out as a sloop and assigned to cruising the Caribbean in search of French merchant vessels. In August she encountered a French privateer from Cherbourg, accompanied by Resolution, a captured British merchant ship. The privateer escaped without giving battle, but Infernal succeeded in retaking Resolution and returning her to London. Infernal was later present during the British landings at Belleisle between April and June 1761, and raids on Martinique in January and February 1762. James Mackenzie died in April 1762 and was replaced by Commander Charles Roche, with Infernal continuing her Caribbean patrols. In company with six other ships she took part in the capture of a single French ship, Post de Nantz, for which prize money was paid the following year. In February 1763 the Treaty of Paris brought an end to the war, and Infernal was returned to Deptford where she was paid off and her crew assigned to other vessels. A marine survey was conducted on 19 May 1763, and another on 31 January 1770, but there were no orders for repairs. Navy Board expenditure indicates she was almost entirely neglected during this time, with a total of £22 being spent in her upkeep between 1763 and 1774. Ware 1994, p. 46 On 26 October 1774, after eleven years at the dockyard, the increasingly decrepit vessel was sold into private hands for ₤350. Her fate thereafter is unknown.

Once she tells her sad story about being a nurse being framed for murder of her charge, by the deceased's nephew Will Hastings (Willis), they agree to help clear her name. As part of trapping Hastings, they demand a $10,000 ransom to release Roth. The ransom is immediately paid, and Roth is turned over to the sheriff. Running a fake newspaper story claiming the release of Roth by the sheriff, Cisco offers to kill Roth for Hastings. Roth is eventually cleared of the murder.

Its is an active learning style. A learning cell is a process of learning where two students alternate asking and answering questions on commonly read materials.  History  The Learning Cell was developed by Marcel Goldschmid of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne in 1971. Learning Cells were proposed to address certain demands of ubiquitous learning for learning resources to be generative, evolving, intelligent, and adaptive.  Concept  The meaning of Cell * Component: Learning cells can compose higher-level learning resources * Origin: learning cells grow from small to big, from weak to strong * Nerve cell: unite to get intelligence  The procedure  Firstly, an assignment is chosen which needs to be prepared by the students, the students will read the assignment and write down the questions that they have about the reading. At the next meeting, the teacher will randomly put the students in pairs. The process begins by designating one student from each pair to begin by asking one of their questions to the other. Once the two students discuss the question, the teacher moves from pair to pair to give feedback and answer questions. This process consists of two elements or parts, two students, so it is also called Dyad.  Features  The features of learning cell are: * Learning Cell integrates content, activities and practices and builds up a larger knowledge network. * Learning Cell is open structured and can communicate with other applications and share information. * Elements of Learning cell includes current version information, editing process description(e.g.: notes or revisions) and past versions. * It includes not just content learning but also learning cognitive wisdom.  Learning patterns  The different ways of using this technique are by reading/listening/watching, doing/acting, connecting, re-organizing, comparing, reflection, communicating, teaching, creating.  Advantages  Under Learning Cell, there are a number of advantages, which include: * Learning can be done space dimension. In the process of learning cell, learning is done in pairs or in groups it can be done anywhere. * Learning can be done in time dimension. There is time limit for this type of learning. Students who are paired can discuss and draw their conclusions and share it with others in their time. But it has to be monitored. * Accepts content from different types of learners and of different level of learners and integrates it. * Learning cell can be adapted in informal learning environment also. * Learning supports u-learning.name=\\"Ref 1\\"  U-Learning  The learning cell was developed from the learning object model and designed for u-learning. The basic idea is to introduce time dimension and interpersonal cognition network into learning resources to make the learning resolvable. During the process, information and the revision history are recorded, an interpersonal network is created, and a connection between the human and knowledge is established to form a knowledge network.

Published by Sourcebooks Landmark, it follows the story of French architect Lucien Bernard, who is paid to create temporary hiding places for Jews in Nazi-occupied Paris. The book reached The New York Times best seller list in July 2015.  Background  An architect specializing in historic preservation, Charles Belfoure had written several non-fiction books on architecture, including works on the history of American banks and rowhouse architecture in Baltimore before writing The Paris Architect. He decided to try writing fiction, thinking it might be a break from his everyday work. A direct inspiration was his discovery that during the reign of Elizabeth I in England special spaces were designed in houses as temporary hiding places for repressed Catholic priests.  Release  The novel was first published in hardcover in the United States on October 8, 2013. Unabridged audible version narrated by Mark Bramhall was released that same year. A paperback edition was released in the U.S. on July 15, 2014.

The book was translated and published in several languages, including Italian (2014), Hebrew (2014), Hungarian (2015), Turkish (2015), Portuguese (2015), Bulgarian (2015), Polish (2015), Norwegian (2016), Romanian (2017) and Czech (2019).  Plot summary  During World War II Lucien Bernard, an architect living in Paris, France, is offered a large fee to design hiding places for Jews being hunted by the Nazis. He desperately needs the money to make a living, although he knows that if caught, he will most likely be killed.  Reception  The book received generally favorable reviews. It was presented by USA Today in the “New Voices” section and was an American Booksellers Association Indie Pick in October 2013. Malcolm Gladwell of The Guardian chose The Paris Architect his favorite book of 2013, calling it “a beautiful and elegant account of an ordinary man's unexpected and reluctant descent into heroism during the second world war”. Vicki Briner of Library Journal wrote that Belfoure’s portrayal of Vichy France “is both disturbing and captivating, and his beautiful tale demonstrates that while human beings are capable of great atrocities, they have a capacity for tremendous acts of courage as well”. New York Post picked the novel as a “must-read”. The Paris Architect was among finalists of the 2015 International Dublin Literary Award and was listed The New York Times best seller list in an e-book category in July 2015.

These semiconductors crystallize either in the zincblende lattice structure or the wurtzite crystal structure. They generally exhibit large band gaps, making them popular for short wavelength applications in optoelectronics.  Fabrication  Very pure cadmium telluride crystal for semiconductor applications II-VI semiconductor compounds are produced with epitaxy methods, like most semiconductor compounds.Wide-Bandgap II–VI Semiconductors: Growth and Properties, publisher=Springer, link The substrate plays an important role for all fabrication methods. Best growth results are obtained by substrates made from the same compound (homoepitaxy), but substrates of other semiconductors are often used to reduce the fabrication cost (a method called heteroepitaxy). In particular, III-V semiconductor compounds like gallium arsenide are frequently used as cheap substrates, resulting in stronger tensions between substrate and growth layer and (generally) lower optoelectronic properties.  Properties  Especially wide bandgap II-VI semiconductor compounds are expected to be very good candidates for high performance applications, such as light emitting diodes and laser diodes for blue and ultraviolet applications. Due to problems with conductivity, the application of these materials is still questionable. The best example is zinc oxide, which shows excellent optical characteristics, though it remains problematic to create sufficient charge carrier densities via doping in zinc oxide.Claus F. Klingshirn, Bruno K. Meyer, Andreas Waag, Axel Hoffmann, Jean Geurts: Zinc oxide. From Fundamental Properties Towards Novel Applications (Springer Series in Materials Science. 120). Springer, Heidelberg u. a. 2010, . Diagram of the band gap plotted versus the lattice parameter a of the ternary alloy combinations of ZnO, CdO and MgO Ternary compounds are one option to vary the band gap of semiconductors almost continuously over a wide energy range. This method is highly dependent on the materials as well as the growth techniques. In particular, materials with very different lattice constants or different crystal phases (wurtzite or zincblende in this case) are difficult to combine. Tensions and impurities due to low crystal quality result in low optoelectronic properties. One example of the basic possibilities achievable with three different compounds is shown in the diagram with zinc oxide (ZnO), cadmium oxide (CdO) and magnesium oxide (MgO). Basically it is possible to gain any band gap between those of the three materials. Consequently, it is possible to choose very specifically the wavelength of photons emitted by laser diodes or light emitting diodes.

This is often referred to as its official address, but the large villa is the seat of the International Institute of Ligurian Studies. To the right of the building is via Clarence Bicknell, leading to the entrance of the gardens of the villa and of the museum. The two buildings are part of the same block. In 1888, Clarence Bicknell built the museum to collect, preserve, and exhibit his archaeological and botanical collections. History Clarence Bicknell was the first to systematically study the images engraved on the rocks of Monte Bego. During his explorations and research, he collected notes, drawings, casts, and photographs that were used by many scholars and enthusiasts. Many of his works were published in the volumes of the Linguistic Society and in French specialized magazines. Bicknell was a passionate botanist; he devoted himself to the study of the local flora and the Maritime Alps in general. His research was published in two books which became a point of reference for scholars in the field: Flowering plants and ferns of the Riviera (1885) and Flora of Bordighera and San Remo or a catalogue of the wild plants growing in western Liguria in the area bounded by the outer watersheds of the Arma and Nervia torrents (1896). The fruits of his passion can be seen in the Bicknell Museum in Bordighera. Created in 1888, it was the first museum of western Liguria. The rectangular building has an entrance protected by a portico with four Roman-inspired columns, built by the English architect Clarence Trait. The interior is inspired by the structure used in Anglican churches, with the podium required by lecturers for their academic presentations. Both sides have a fine fireplace decorated by Bicknell with floral and animal motifs. On the fireplace on the right, there is a quote by Dante Alighieri: \\"Don’t do science if you do not think you have understood\\", and on the left, the crests of those who collaborated in the creation of the museum: Clarence Tait, Giovenale Gastaldi, Francesco Giovannelli, and Bicknell.[Bordighera Armando Besio ] The museum also contains Clarence Bicknell’s library, where it is possible to consult some 85,000 volumes, 3,000 journals specialised in art and local history, 14,000 engravings, and his famous personal collection of butterflies, known to still be one of the most prestigious in Europe. On Bicknell’s death, all the museum's properties were inherited by the son of his sister, Edward Elhanan Berry, with whom he was very close, and by his wife Margaret Serocold Berry, whom he considered as a daughter.Margaret and Edward Berry Berry came to Bordighera in 1880 at the age of 19 years to open a bank for the British. He immediately formed a special bond with this uncle whom he never knew before, and who passed on to him a passion for botany and history. Berry, who did much with his uncle for the creation of the museum, made many contributions to the collections gathered by Bicknell. In the building adjacent to the museum lies the International Institute of Ligurian Studies, where one can admire the original book published by Berry in 1931, At the western gate of Italy, which was long regarded as an essential text for anyone who wanted to study art and architecture of the Italian Riviera.Bordighera When Edward died, Margaret worked to maintain the museum and the cultural activities launched by Bicknell and by her husband. She even made their private residence, Villa Monteverde (via Mostaccini 54), now a private residence, one of the most fashionable lounges in Bordighera.[Bordighera Armando Besio ] During the Fascist period, the British became 'persona non grata' in Italy, and Margaret passed the precious museum and all of its contents to Nino Lamboglia, with whom she had worked in 1932, to build the future International Institute of Ligurian Studies. The Bicknell Museum, the International Institute of Ligurian Studies, and the portion of the Roman street (Via Augusta) are part of the property protected by the Superintendence for Architectural Heritage and Landscape of Liguria.List of protected properties The garden The museum, as often happens in Bordighera, is nestled in a lush garden with old trees. The main star of this little paradise is a huge \\"Ficus Magnolioide\\" located near the entrance. This tree from Oceania has adapted very well to Bordighera’s micro climate, to the point that it has reached the height of 21 meters and a diameter of 8.6 meters. During its growth, it has incorporated a part of the wall and the gate’s original entry. This tree is on the list of monumental trees of Italy, identified by the State Forestry Corps. Not far away, there is also another ficus, smaller, but also of great value. In the garden, you can also admire a small monument in honour of Clarence Bicknell as well as a fragment of the old Roman road.

He first appeared in the 1991 video game Street Fighter II as one of eight playable characters, and was subsequently featured in sequel and spin-off games. Blanka is also present in a number of Capcom's crossover games, including the SNK vs. Capcom series. The character has appeared in other media adaptations of the franchise, including an animated film, a live-action movie, an animated television series, a comic book and manga series. Blanka was originally designed as a human character by Akira \\"Akiman\\" Yasuda, and underwent several re-conceptualizations during the production of Street Fighter II before reaching his final depiction as a feral savage with green skin and long orange hair. Blanka's backstory is that he was once human, but after a plane crash in Brazil he mutated (resulting in his green coloring and his ability to generate electricity). Blanka was generally well received by critics and fans, becoming one of the most popular characters in the franchise. Conception and design =Creation= Designed by Akira \\"Akiman\\" Yasuda, the concept behind Blanka emerged in an early design as an African man named Anabebe who was raised by a lion. After the release of Final Fight, Capcom again approached Street Fighter II and considered several designs for the Blanka character (including a masked wrestler modeled after Tiger Mask and a ninja-style warrior). His design later changed to a large man with thick hair and sideburns, named \\"Hammer Blanka\\". The staff then adopted Blanka's feral appearance, because they felt the game would be \\"dull\\" with only human characters. =Characteristics= Blanka's most prominent physical characteristic is his green color, initially attributed to his consumption of chlorophyll from plants to blend into his jungle environment. However, when Street Fighter was brought to the U.S., Blanka's coloring was attributed to his being struck by lightning during the electrical storm in which his plane crashed. In Street Fighter II Blanka's skin is yellowish-green, but later versions of the character are bright green. Blanka's height information is above , although he looks almost shorter than Vega, whose height is listed at around especially in the Street Fighter 2 series. Blanka has the average size in the Street Fighter series and his official height information is probably an error. Blanka fights in a self-taught, animalistic style. In several of his special moves he rolls into a ball, launching himself at an opponent. In Blanka's signature attack, he crouches and emits an electric current shocking anything it touches. Blanka was only capable of beast-like noises in his earlier appearances, but began to speak with words starting with Street Fighter IV. Appearances =Video game= Blanka first appears in Street Fighter II, when he sees his mother (who tells his backstory) after he competes in the World Warrior tournament. According to the story, Blanka was born as a boy named Jimmy who was involved in a plane crash in the Amazon rainforest. Although in the initial games Blanka's mother says the plane crashed when he was \\"a little boy\\", the manual for Street Fighter IV says it happened when he was a baby. After the crash he was exposed to electric eels, triggering the mutation which changed his appearance and gave him electric powers. In Street Fighter Alpha 3, a prequel to Street Fighter II, Blanka rides on a truck to civilization for the first time. After defeating Zangief, Balrog and the leader of the Shadaloo criminal organization M. Bison, Blanka joins old friend Dan Hibiki and Sakura (Dan's pupil) to destroy Bison's \\"psycho drive\\" weapon. Blanka then returns to the jungle. In Street Fighter IV, whose events are set after Street Fighter II, Blanka, living in a town, feels out of place and decides to travel the world. At the end of the game, Dan helps his mother find him in Hong Kong. In Super Street Fighter IV, Blanka enters a worldwide tournament to be recognized by people so his mother will be proud of him. When he returns home, the townspeople visit him and he plays games with the local children. Blanka returns as a playable character in the Arcade Edition of Street Fighter V. In the game's story, he attempts to gain more popularity by selling miniature dolls of himself called \\"Blanka-chans.\\" Blanka also appears in several spin- off titles. He is a playable character in the later Street Fighter EX series games Street Fighter EX2 and Street Fighter EX3, Capcom vs. SNK, Capcom vs. SNK 2 and the home version of Street Fighter: The Movie. Blanka is a playable character by default in the PlayStation Vita version of Street Fighter X Tekken, and via downloadable content in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. He is a boss character in Street Fighter X Mega Man. =Other media= Blanka briefly appears in Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, when he is lowered from a cage and defeats Zangief. The live-action Street Fighter film combined Blanka and Charlie into one character. Charlie is taken captive by Bison, who forces Dhalsim to subject him to genetic testing to create the perfect soldier. Blanka was played by Robert Mammone, while Kim Repia played the role in its home console video game adaptation. The American cartoon series retained the film's origin story for the character, as he and Guile search for a cure for his mutation. In UDON's Street Fighter comic adaptation, Blanka is used as a living weapon by Shadaloo until he is rescued by Delta Red (Cammy's squad). Returning to his senses, he reunites with his mother. Blanka is an opponent faced by Ryu, Guile, and Chun-Li in the Street Fighter manga history, and makes a cameo appearance in the Disney film Wreck-It Ralph. Reception Blanka has been described as a fan favorite by video game media UGO Networks, IGN, GameSpot and 1UP.com, with IGN calling him \\"one of the most recognizable Street Fighter characters\\". GamesRadar said that Blanka \\"never quite approached Chun-Li's popularity, but has gained a strong fan following nevertheless\\". Sharing ninth place with Ken Masters in the Japanese magazine Gamests 1991 best-character list, in the 1992 poll he finished 38th. Blanka was voted 20th in Capcom's poll of 85 characters for the series' 15th anniversary. In 2008, the character was the tenth-most-popular video game character (out of 500) in the United Kingdom. Although Blanka was well received by Brazilian gamers, Capcom was criticized for its depiction of Brazil. Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono, surprised when told that Blanka is popular among Brazilians, apologized for the poor impression of the country given by the character. When the Brazilian program Custe o Que Custar asked people in Spain who the best-known Brazilians were, Blanka ranked third (after Gisele Bündchen and Pelé). In 2009, after Rio de Janeiro was chosen to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, an internet meme spread making Blanka the games' unofficial mascot. A 2012 meme said that O Maior Brasileiro de Todos os Tempos, the Brazilian version of 100 Greatest Britons, had chosen Blanka the \\"Greatest Brazilian of All Time\\". IGN ranked Blanka seventh of its \\"Top 25 Street Fighter Characters\\", noting his unique characteristics, and GameDaily placed Blanka fourth on its \\"Top 20 Street Fighter Characters of All Time\\" list. He was ranked the franchise's 17th-best character (out of 50) by UGO as initially \\"hook[ing]\\" gamers and \\"an indispensable part of Street Fighter now.\\" Including Blanka on a list of \\"The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years\\", GamesRadar staff said that they could include all of Street Fighter IIs characters but would only choose \\"the wildest of the crazy characters in the game. Blanka exemplifies the special brand of insanity that made us love Capcom.\\" Edges James Leach called him \\"by far the best character\\" in Street Fighter II. GameSpy called Blanka one of the \\"25 Extremely Rough Brawlers\\" in video gaming, praising the brutality of his attacks. The Pittsburgh Tribune- Review described the character as resembling \\"some ridiculous hair-club-for- Hulks member\\", although his electric attacks made him an effective character.

It was the seventeenth title produced for the company's CP System hardware. The game stars the titular superhero who was originally conceived as a fictional spokesman used by Capcom USA in the company's console games during the late 1980s. On September 13, 2018, Capcom announced Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle with Captain Commando being one of seven titles and released digitally for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows on September 18, 2018. Plot Captain Commando is set in the crime-ridden future of Metro City in the year 2026, where a superhero named Captain Commando, assisted by his three faithful Commando Companions rise up to protect the Earth and all the Galaxy from a gang of super-powered criminals. Characters ; He is the leader of the \\"Commando Team\\". Besides his powerful mind and strong body, he also uses his \\"Energy Gloves,\\" which can shoot mighty bolts of fire and electricity. His killer technique is the \\"Captain Corridor\\". Striking the ground with his Energy Gloves causes an electric shock which kills everyone around him. Captain Commando's dash attacks are \\"Captain Cannon\\" (also known as \\"Captain Fire\\") which torches the enemy with a blast of flame and \\"Captain Kick\\" which can hit several enemies at once on the ground or in the air. Captain Commando also can grab his opponent and kick their stomach or throw their whole body. Other things he uses are the \\"Captain Goggles\\" which help him identify a criminal's face at a distance of 2 km, by comparing with data base, the \\"Captain Protector\\" which is made of super-tough material called \\"Captanium\\" and stands up to trillion degree heat, the \\"Captain Gauntlet\\" which multiplies Captain's power 48 times making it easy for him to smash a thick iron plate and the \\"Captain Boots\\" which make it possible for him to take a 100-meter fall without injuries or damage to the boots. ; The Mummy Commando is a mummy-like alien from outer space. As weapons he uses sub-sonic knives that melt any enemy he hits. His killer technique is the \\"Spinning Attack\\". Spinning around like a top, his bandages lash his enemies like whips. Mack's dash attacks are \\"Double Trouble\\" which sticks his enemy with both knives and \\"Sky Assault\\" which is an airborne version of Double Trouble. Mack also can grab his enemy and either stick or throw them. Other things he has are the \\"Captain Cap\\" which is a souvenir from the first meeting with Captain Commando, the \\"Genetic Bandage\\" which is his life-sustaining equipment for survival on Earth, the \\"Genetic Knife\\" which melts all matter and the \\"Gravity Controllers\\" which are his pair of shoes that adjust the gravitational pull to where it is best for the battles. Mack's English name comes from the Bertolt Brecht song of the same title. ; The Ninja Commando is a highly trained ninja and successor to Bushin-ryu Ninpo, a fighting style of ninjutsu that was also inherited by Guy from Final Fight. His razor-sharp sword is capable of cutting an opponent in two. His killer technique is his \\"Smoke Bomb\\". After creating a smoke screen around his body, the smoke explodes, killing his enemies that are adjacent. Ginzu's dash attacks are \\"Iaizuki\\" which pierces several enemies at once and \\"Flying Katana\\" which cuts the enemies from above while jumping. Ginzu can grab his opponents and either kick their stomach or do a shoulder throw or overhead throw. Other things he is equipped with are his \\"Ninja Eyes\\" which can help him find enemies 500 meters ahead in pitch dark, his \\"Servant Sword\\" serves no one but him, is named \\"Lightning Light\\" and cuts things at atomic levels and his \\"Ninja Suit\\" which is tougher than iron and softer than silk. He is the only character who is able to throw shurikens at his opponents. ; The Baby Commando is a super genius infant who fights using a robot of his own design. His robot is both strong and quick. His killer technique is his \\"Knee Rocket\\" which launches a missile from the robot's knee which are constantly manufactured within the robot. Baby Head's dash attacks are \\"Rolling Punch\\" which is a strong punch that spins like a drill and \\"Elbow Smash\\" which crushes the enemy under an elbow blow coming off a jump. Baby Head can grab his enemies and do either a knee kick, a \\"Pile-driver\\" or a \\"Fling-away\\". Other features he uses are the \\"Talking Machine\\" which resembles a baby pacifier and allows him to speak the 3 million languages of the cosmos, the \\"Stable Cradle\\" which keeps the robot from rocking, no matter how far it is tilted, the \\"Silverfist Vehicle\\" which has 12,000 horsepower, 582 kilograms (1280.4 pounds) of bodyweight and mounts fuzzy-logic control, the \\"Missile Launcher\\" which is a missile production facility built inside the leg, as well as in the Silvervest Vehicle and is nicknamed by Baby Head's friends \\"Baby Carriage\\" and the \\"Jet Hover\\" which is used for high-speed position shifting. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Captain Commando follows the same gameplay established in Capcom's previous beat-'em-up Final Fight. The arcade version allows up to two, three, or even four players simultaneously depending on the game's settings. The player can select between any of the four \\"commandos\\" (Mack, Captain, Ginzu, or Baby-Head) as their character, with each player controlling a different character. The player's objective as usual is to move towards the end of each stage, defeat every adversary who gets in their way while avoiding any traps that they may throw at the player's way before eventually fighting the boss awaiting at the final area of each stage. The game consists of a total of nine stages. The control configuration is exactly like Final Fight, with an eight-way joystick for moving the character left or right, as well as towards or away from the background, along with two action buttons for attacking and jumping. The player can perform numerous combinations of attacks while standing or jumping, including grabbing the enemy, as well as a special attack by pressing the attack and jump simultaneously that will drain a portion of the player's vitality. An addition to the controls is the ability to dash by pushing the joystick left or right twice. The player can perform a running attack or even a running jump attack. Like in Final Fight, the player can pick up health-restoring food items hidden inside barrels and other destructible objects to restore their vitality, as well as other bonus items to increase their score. Weapons also can be picked up, such as three different types of firearms, as well as shurikens that can only be used by Ginzu. Players also can ride certain robots by dismounting their riders and then jumping over the robot. The robots have their own vitality gauge and if they sustain enough damage, they will be destroyed. There are three types of robots in the game: a punching robot, a flame- throwing robot, and a freezing robot. Unlike Final Fight, weapons can be carried when the player makes the transition to a new area until the stage is completed. Development Earlier depictions of Captain Commando from the rear packaging of Capcom's NES games. The rendition on the left was featured in games released between 1986 and 1987, while the rendition on the right is from games released in 1989. The origin of Captain Commando as a character predates his appearance in his self-titled game, in the packaging and manuals of many of Capcom's earlier titles for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America released between 1986 and 1989. All of Capcom's games released for the NES between 1986 and 1988 (1942, Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Mega Man, Trojan, Section Z and Gun Smoke) were released as part of the \\"Captain Commando Challenge Series\\" and featured a drawing of the Captain on the back of the packaging, which depicted him as a \\"futuristic\\" space hero wielding a raygun on each hand and two large medallions around his neck with the letter \\"C\\" engraved on each. Each game's instruction manual also featured a \\"Special Message\\" from the Captain addressed to the owner of the game, congratulating the player for purchasing one of Capcom's products. Additionally, the instruction manual for Section Z has the otherwise nameless player character uniting with Captain Commando himself. Although it is unclear if that means they both control the spacesuit or if Captain Commando is a separate character. A revised version of the Captain Commando character appeared again in Capcom's NES lineup in 1989 (Strider, Mega Man 2, Willow, and Duck Tales). The artwork on the rear packaging of those games featured an illustration of Captain Commando wearing a pilot suit in front of a fighter jet, holding a helmet under his right arm, with an alien chimp sitting on his right shoulder and the Capcom logo in an airbrushed style above them. The text above the artwork featured a message from the Captain advising the reader to \\"look to (him) for up-to-date reports for all the exciting action games from Capcom\\", followed by the Captain's apparent handwritten signature. Home versions and related releases *A Super NES 16 Meg port was released in 1995. This port only allows up to two players, shows less on-screen enemies and lacks the mech-suit. It is also censored on several aspects. *A PlayStation port was released in Japan only on September 17, 1998, by New Inc. This port allows up to three players with the use of a multiplayer adapter. *The original CPS game is included in emulated form in the compilations Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed for the PlayStation Portable, Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, both released in 2006 and Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in 2018. *A 64DD version was announced but canceled. Legacy Captain Commando would return as a player character in the fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom in 1998, as one of the characters representing Capcom. The Captain has a transformation sequence prior to each match which depicts him in a suit (or in a cowboy outfit) before donning his superhero costume. His \\"Commando Strike\\" special move, as well as both of his Hyper Combos (the \\"Captain Sword\\" and the \\"Captain Storm\\"), has him summoning his \\"Commando Companions\\" to attack his opponent. The Captain's victory quotes consist of random Capcom trivia, while his ending in Marvel vs. Capcom is a homage to the ending in his original game. This incarnation of Captain Commando also appears in the sequel, Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Besides the Marvel vs. Capcom games, Captain Commando also appears in four other cross-over games: Capcom World 2, Namco × Capcom, Project X Zone 2 and the SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash series. A two-volume manga was also published in Japan in 1994 in Gamest Comics, which was translated and published overseas by UDON. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Captain Commando on their December 1, 1991 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Street Fighter II: The World Warrior and WWF WrestleFest.

The cultivars most familiar in East Asia have a uniform red color, but white, black, gray, and variously mottled varieties also are known. Scientists presume Vigna angularis var. nipponensis is the progenitor.  Origin and diversity  = Speciation and domestication = The wild ancestor of cultivated adzuki bean is probably Vigna angularis var. nipponensis, which is distributed across Japan, Korea, China, Nepal and Bhutan. Speciation between Vigna angularis var. nipponensis and Vigna angularis var. angularis occurred around years ago. Archaeologists estimate it was domesticated around 3000 BC. However, adzuki beans (as well as soybeans) dating from 3000 BC to 2000 BC are indicated to still be largely within the wild size range. Enlarged seeds occurred during the later Bronze Age or Iron Age, periods with plough use. Domestication of adzuki beans resulted in a trade-off between yield and seed size. Cultivated adzuki beans have fewer but longer pods, fewer but larger seeds, a shorter stature, and also a smaller overall seed yield than wild forms. The exact place of domestication is not known; multiple domestication origins in East Asia (for example Japan, China, and Korea) have been suggested. = Breeding = Adzuki beans, illustration from the Japanese agricultural encyclopedia Seikei Zusetsu (1804) In Japan, the adzuki bean was one of the first crops subjected to scientific plant breeding. Important breeding traits are yield, pureness of the bean colour, and the maturing time. Separate cultivars with smaller seeds and higher biomass are bred for fodder production and as green manure. Locally adapted cultivars are available in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. More than 300 cultivars/landraces/breeding lines are registered in Japan. Moreover, China (Institute of Crop Germplasm Resources (CAAS), Beijing, more than 3700 accessions) and Japan (Tokachi Agricultural Experiment Station, Hokkaido, about 2500 accessions) accommodate large germplasm collections of adzuki bean. = Weed forms = Weed forms of adzuki bean frequently occur in Japan. The wide spread of weed forms is due to adaptation to human-disturbed habitats, escapes of old cultivars, and natural establishment from derivatives of hybrids between cultivars and wild forms. In contrast to wild forms, the weed forms of adzuki bean are used as a substitute for the cultivated form and consumed as sweet beans, especially if cultivated adzuki beans are attacked by pests. However, in cultivated gardens the weed form is recognized as contamination and lowers the seed quality of adzuki cultivars. Names Yōkan (羊羹) is a thick Japanese jellied dessert made of adzuki bean paste, agar, and sugar The name adzuki (or azuki) is a transliteration of the native Japanese name. Japanese also has a Chinese loanword, , which means \\"small bean\\", its counterpart being the soybean. It is common to write in kanji but pronounce it as azuki ', an example of '. In China, the corresponding name () still is used in botanical or agricultural parlance, however, in everyday Chinese, the more common terms are ' () and ' (), both meaning \\"red bean\\", because almost all Chinese cultivars are uniformly red. In English-language discussions of Chinese topics, the term \\"red bean\\" often is used (especially in reference to red bean paste), but in other contexts this usage may cause confusion with other beans that also are red. In normal contexts, \\"red cowpeas\\" have been used to refer to this bean. In Korean, adzuki beans are called ' () and it contrasts with ' (, \\"bean\\"), rather than being considered a type of it. ' (\\"beans\\") without qualifiers usually means soybeans. In Vietnamese it is called ' (literally: red bean). In some parts of India, they are referred to as \\"red chori\\". In Punjabi it is called ' and is a common ingredient of chaat. In Marathi, it is known as ' (), literally meaning 'red cowpea'. In Iraq its name is ' () meaning \\"red cowpeas\\".  Cultivation  = Area and yield = The adzuki bean is mainly cultivated in China ( ha), Japan ( ha), South Korea ( ha), and Taiwan ( ha) (data published 2006). The bean is also grown commercially in the US, South America, and India, as well as New Zealand, Kongo, and Angola. In Japan, the adzuki bean is the second most important legume after the soy bean; its 1998 annual yield of this crop was around 100,000 tons. With a consumption of about 140,000 t/year (data published 2006), Japan is also the most important importer of adzuki beans. The imports are received from China, Korea, Colombia, Taiwan, US, Thailand, and Canada. The bean yields per area spread over a broad range due to differing cultivation intensity. Amounts of 4 to 8 dt/ha are reported, but in Japan and China yields between 20 and 30 dt/ha are reached. = Ecological requirements = Optimal temperature range for adzuki bean growth is between 15 °C and 30 °C. The crop is not frost-hardy and needs soil temperatures above 6-10 °C (30°-34 °C optimal) for germination. Hot temperatures stimulate vegetative growth and are therefore less favorable for pea production. The adzuki bean is usually not irrigated. Annual rainfall ranges from 500–1750 mm in areas where the bean is grown. The plant can withstand drought but severe reduction in yield is expected. The cultivation of the adzuki bean is possible on preferably well drained soils with pH 5-7.5. Fertilizer application differs widely depending on expected yield but is generally similar to soybean. Due to nodulation with rhizobia nitrogen fixation of up to 100 kg/ha is possible. = Production = The sowing of the peas is in 2–3 cm depth in rows 30–90 cm apart and 10–45 cm within the row. Rarely seeds are sown by broadcast. The amount of seeds ranges between 8–70 kg/ha. Growth of the crop is slow, therefore weed control is crucial mainly between germination and flowering. Cultivation systems differ largely among different countries. In China adzuki bean is often grown in intercrops with maize, sorghum and millet while in Japan the bean is grown in crop rotations. Harvest of the peas should not be done as long as moisture content of the seed is higher than 16%. = Pests and diseases = Fungal and bacterial diseases of the adzuki bean are powdery mildew, brown stem rot, and bacterial blight. Furthermore, pests such as the adzuki pod worm, Japanese butterbur borer, and cutworm attack the crop. The bean weevil is an important storage pest.  Botany  Illustration The description of the adzuki bean can vary between authors because there are both wild and cultivated forms of the plant. The adzuki bean is an annual, rarely biennial bushy erect or twining herb usually between 30 and 90 centimeters high. There exist climbing or prostrate forms of the plant. The stem is normally green and sparsely pilose. = Roots = The adzuki bean has a taproot type of root system that can reach a depth of 40–50 cm from the point of seed germination. = Leaves = The leaves of the adzuki bean are trifoliate, pinnate and arranged alternately along the stem on a long petiole. Leaflets are ovate and about 5–10 cm long and 5–8 cm wide. = Flowers = Adzuki flowers are papilionaceous and bright yellow. The inflorescence is an axillary false raceme consisting of six to ten (two to twenty) flowers. = Fruits = Adzuki pods are smooth, cylindrical and thin-walled. The colour of the pods is green turning white to grey as they mature. The size is between 5–13 cm x 0.5 cm with 2 to 14 seeds per pod. Pod shatter during seed ripening and harvesting might be a difficulty under certain conditions. = Seeds = The seeds are smooth and subcylindric with a length of 5.0-9.1 mm, width of 4.0-6.3 mm, thickness of 4.1-6.0 mm. The thousand kernel weight is between 50 and 200 g. There are many different seed colours from maroon to blue-black mottled with straw. = Physiology = The emergence of the seedlings is hypogeal and takes 7–20 days. Compared to other pulses the growth of the plant is slow. Normally the adzuki plant reaches maturity between 80 and 120 days depending on the cultivar and the environmental conditions. Flowering lasts 30–40 days. Commonly the plant self-pollinates but cross-pollination also exists. Uses In East Asian cuisine, the adzuki bean is commonly sweetened before eating. In particular, it often is boiled with sugar, resulting in red bean paste (anko), a very common ingredient in all of these cuisines. It also is common to add flavoring to the bean paste, such as chestnut. Red bean paste is used in many Chinese dishes, such as tangyuan, zongzi, mooncakes, baozi, and red bean ice. It also serves as a filling in Japanese sweets such as anpan, dorayaki, imagawayaki, manjū, monaka, anmitsu, taiyaki, and daifuku. A more liquid version, using adzuki beans boiled with sugar and a pinch of salt, produces a sweet dish called hong dou tang. Adzuki beans are commonly eaten sprouted or boiled in a hot, tea-like drink. Some East Asian cultures enjoy red bean paste as a filling or topping for various kinds of waffles, pastries, baked buns, or biscuits. Traditionally in Japan, rice with adzuki beans (赤飯; sekihan) is cooked for auspicious occasions. Adzuki beans are used in amanattō and ice cream with the whole bean (such as in the 'Cream & Red Bean' product produced by IMEI) or as paste. Nutritional information Cooked adzuki beans are 66% water, 25% carbohydrates, including 7% dietary fiber, 8% protein, and contain negligible fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, cooked beans provide 128 calories, a moderate to high content (10% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamin folate (30% DV), and several dietary minerals (11% to 27% DV, table).

The paste is prepared by boiling the beans, then mashing or grinding them. At this stage, the paste can be sweetened or left as it is. The color of the paste is usually dark red, which comes from the husk of the beans. In Korean cuisine, the azuki beans (often the black variety) can also be husked prior to cooking, resulting in a white paste.

Geopi (, \\"hulled, skinned, peeled, shelled, etc.\\") attached to pat makes geopipat (), the dehulled red beans and the white paste made of geopipat is called geopipat-so (). Types Red bean paste is graded according to its consistency, sweetness, and color. =Chinese= In Chinese cuisine, the most common types are: * Mashed: Azuki beans are boiled with sugar and mashed. The paste is smooth with bits of broken beans and bean husk. Depending on the intended texture, the beans can be vigorously or lightly mashed. Some unmashed beans can also be added back into the bean paste for additional texture. This is the most common and popular type of red bean paste eaten in Chinese confections. It can also be eaten on its own or in sweet soups. * Smooth: Azuki beans are boiled without sugar, mashed, and diluted into a slurry. The slurry is then strained through a sieve to remove the husk, filtered, and squeezed dry using cheesecloth. Although the dry paste can be directly sweetened and used, oil, either vegetable oil or lard, is usually used to cook the dry paste and improve its texture and mouth feel. Smooth bean paste is mainly used as a filling for Chinese pastries. =Japanese= In Japanese cuisine and confectionary, the most common types are: * Tsubuan (), whole red beans boiled with sugar but otherwise untreated * Tsubushian (), where the beans are mashed after boiling * Koshian (), which has been passed through a sieve to remove bean skins; the most common type * Sarashian (), which has been dried and reconstituted with water * Ogura-an (), which is a mix of koshian and tsubuan. =Korean= Patso (red bean paste) In Korean cuisine and confectionery, the most common types are: * Patso (), dark-red paste made by boiling and then mashing or grinding red beans. The bean skins may or may not be removed by sifting the paste through a sieve to make the paste smoother. * Danpat () or danpat-so (), sweetened red bean paste, made by adding honey or sugar when making patso. The bean skins are often removed to make the paste smoother. * Geopipat-so (), white paste made by boiling dehulled red beans, and then mashing or grinding them. Uses =Chinese= Red bean paste is used in many Chinese dishes, such as: * Red bean soup (; pinyin: hóng dòu tāng / hóng dòu shā): In some recipes, red bean paste with more water added to form a tong sui, or thick, sweet soup. It is often cooked and eaten with tangyuan and lotus seeds.

He was born and died in Augsburg. Life Neuhofer's father, Georg Christoph Neuhofer (1734-1796) was an Augsburg cotton worker.Krauss, Ludwig F., Kurze Nachricht von dem Leben des Herrn Gerhard Adam Neuhofer, wohlverdienten Diakonus bey St. Anna in Augsburg, nebst der am Grabe des Seligen von Herrn Dekan Krauß gesprochenen Trauerrede, Augsburg: Rollwagen 1816 From the year of his fifth birthday Gerhard Adam Neuhofer attended the St.Anna Gymnasium (school) in the city, where he remained a pupil till 1791. During this time, during the early 1780s he was also receiving private tuition from his cousin, the young deacon (later noteworthy both for his writings on natural history and as the parson at the protestant ), Gottlieb Tobias Wilhelm (1758-1811). He moved away between 1791 and 1795 to enroll at the University of Altdorf where the scope of his studies covered Poetry, Rhetoric, History, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Philosophy and Theology. Influential tutors included the protestant theologians Johann Philipp Gabler and Georg Lorenz Bauer. Another was Wolfgang Jäger who died shortly after Neuhofer completed his studies and returned to Augsburg in May 1795. Neuhofer promptly composed a detailed obituary of Jäger.Gerhardvm Adamvm Nevhofervm, Memoriae Viri Magnifici Excellentissimi Ac Doctissimi Wolfgangi Iaegeri Philosophiae Doctoris, Altorfii MDCCLXXXV In 1795 he passed his Theology exams at Augsburg and became a Catechist in a House of correction (Zuchthaus), moving on in January 1799 to a so-called \\"Pestilentiarius\\". This involved extensive work in military hospitals in 1799 and 1800 which provided him with good experience, but it also imperiled his life through frequent exposure to infectious diseases. In January 1803 he became an \\"Adjunkt\\" in a hospital and in March 1805 he was appointed deacon at Augsburg's Barfüßerkirche. The next year, in January 1806, he was installed as deacon at St James's (St. Jakob). In 1807 he took a teaching post at his old school, giving lessons in Greek, Hebrew and History. However, it appears that by this time his health was beginning to falter, and in 1809 he was obliged to give up his teaching work on health grounds. He was appointed deacon at St. Anna's in 1813. In addition, during these years Neuhofer worked tirelessly on his writing, while also contributing to the \\"Morgenblatt für gebildete Leser\\" (\\"Morning news sheet for [well] educated readers\\") published by Johann Friedrich Cotta. Personal Neuhofer married his first wife, Johanna Dorothea Wasser, in 1803. Her father was the minister in charge at St James's (St. Jakob)'s church. By the time she died, in November 1815, only two of their ten children were still alive. In May 1816 he married another minister's daughter, Rosina Barbara Sophia Degmair.Helene Burger, Hermann Erhard, Hans Wiedemann, Pfarrerbuch Bayerisch-Schwaben, Neustadt 2001, p. 150 A few months later, on 12 December 1816, Neuhofer himself died unexpectedly at his home from what was described as a \\"nervous attack\\" (einem \\"Nervenschlag\\"), shortly after delivering a tutorial to students. His grave no longer survives, but details are recorded by Ferdinand Seidel who in 1838 recorded the details of all the inscriptions in Augsburg on graves of Protestants.Heute Grabstätte 1 3 262 (alte Grabnr. 60/9) References Category:18th-century German writers Category:19th-century German writers Category:1773 births Category:1816 deaths ","title":"Gerhard Adam Neuhofer"},{"id":"47785640","text":"Edward Grose-Hodge (15 January 1855 - 2 April 1928) was a priest in the Church of England, a prebendary of St Paul’s Cathedral and Whitehead Professor of Divinity at the London College of Divinity.

The inventory includes properties such as archaeological sites, fortifications, religious buildings, monuments and other buildings. The NICPMI is under the responsibility of the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage (SCH), which was founded in 2002 to replace the Antiquities Act. The NICPMI was established on 16 December 2011. According to article 7(5)(a) of the Cultural Heritage Act, 2002: > (5) It shall be the function of the Superintendence: > :(a) to establish, update, manage and, where appropriate, publish, or to > ensure the compilation of, a national inventory of cultural property > belonging: > ::(i) to the State or State institutions, > ::(ii) to the Catholic Church and to other religious denominations, > ::(iii) to Foundations established in these islands, > ::(iv) to physical and juridical persons when the cultural property has > been made accessible to the public, or when such persons have given their > consent for such a purpose; The offices of the Superintendence were located at 138, Melita Street, Valletta until 2008, and are now at 173, St. Christopher's Street, Valletta. In the book Il-Mit Pawlin u l-Abbuż tal-Istorja Maltija (The Pauline Mythology and the Abuse of Maltese History), author Mark Camilleri criticizes the Superintendence for supporting Pauline mythology by presenting the 12th-17th centuries tales purported by Giovanni Francesco Abela as fact, and for supporting the idea that Christianity in Malta has been continuous since the supposed shipwreck in Malta, which contemporary historians such as history professor Godfrey Wettinger discredit as pseudo-history. Camilleri wrote that the Superintendent, and those responsible for the NICPMI, set aside archeological research related to the Arab period in Malta (870-1091). When requesting information of the Arab period remains in Malta, under the access to information act (based on the Aarhus Convention), the Superintendence refused to cooperate. This listed niche of Christ the King in Qormi was demolished in 2017. In a report published by the Superintendence in 2016, it was made public that the list of protected inventory were not updated according to its aimed obligations. The Superintendence cited the spiral number of development application as the reason for running out of resources to update the lists. The Malta Developers Association still complains of the timing period which businesspeople have to wait for processing applications, and the costs are put on those purchasing the eventual properties in the market if approved. Sites and buildings listed on the inventory are not necessarily protected. For example, the building that included a niche with a statue of Christ the King in Qormi, which was listed on NICPMI as number 00475, was demolished in 2017. The 2016 Development and Planning Act permits the Planning Authority to ignore the recommendations of the SCH. Significant of the listed monuments, such as churches, are under responsibility of religious groups and the Superintendence does not intervene over their decisions.

Shaped by philosophical readings, marked by a sense of anxiety and the influence of André Gide, much of his early literary work falls into the category of Trăirism. These traits are complemented by Manoliu's activities in cultural journalism, alternating between contributions to left-wing papers and support for the far-right and mystical philosophy of Nae Ionescu. By the time of World War II, he had also begun writing historical fiction and plays, penning anticommunist and anti- Soviet articles in the central newspapers. Manoliu was persecuted and twice imprisoned by the communist regime in the 1950s, serving time on the building site of the Danube–Black Sea Canal. Banned from publishing upon his return, he focused instead on translation work, and achieved national recognition for his renditions from Thomas Mann. He nevertheless lived a secluded life, marked by poverty, and continued to write works which went unpublished, in particular diaries. Biography =Early life and debut= Born in Mihăileni, Botoșani County, his parents were the teacher Ion Manoliu and his wife Victoria (née Stavrat). After attending primary school in his native village, he went to high school in Botoșani and Iași. He later enrolled in the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University,Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române, vol. II, p. 32. Pitești: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. during which time he was hired by Petre P. Negulescu to work at the Romanian Academy Library. Ofelia Ichim, \\"Petru Manoliu: pasiunea pentru istorie\\", in Revista Limba Română, Nr. 4–6/2006 Manoliu had noted contributions in Bilete de Papagal (which he also edited, under director Tudor Arghezi), and, from 1930 to 1930, he was editor of the newspaper Curentul, Paul Ungureanu, \\"Petru Manoliu: un mare eseist și publicist remarcabil\\", in Jurnalul Literar, 2006 and, in 1931, also put out Pământul magazine, based in Botoșani. This was the beginning of a long career in the press, for which Manoliu sometimes used the pen names Erasm, Dr. Nicolai Flamel, Petru M., Pet. Man and Arhiman. Around 1933, he was commissioned by Paul Zarifopol to translate Ortega y Gasset's Revolt of the Masses, published in Revista Fundațiilor Regale.Nicolae Florescu, \\"Printre 'ineditele' lui Petru Manoliu\\", in Acolada, Nr. 4/2008, p. 22 His first standalone book was the 1935 novel Rabbi Haies Reful, followed in 1936 by Tezaur bolnav (\\"Sickly Treasure\\", 1936).Călinescu, p. 1030; Crohmălniceanu, p. 630 He also published scattered poetry, generally inspired by the more depressing periods of his life, and evidencing strong influences from Mihai Eminescu. Such works place him among the writers who regarded living as a mystical experience, a succession of revolutionary discontent, gratuitous gestures, and deep anguish—the \\"new generation\\" authors, or Trăirists.Crohmălniceanu, pp. 113, 498; Ornea, pp. 162–163 Animated by the idea of a role for his literary generation (based around this \\"new spirituality\\" of the 1930s), he formed part of a group of writers who sough to integrated Romanian culture into the wider European context, while giving it a specific national dimension: Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Mihail Sebastian, Anton Holban, Constantin Noica, Mircea Vulcănescu, Nicolae Steinhardt, Petru Comarnescu, Petre Pandrea and Edgar Papu. He carried out a prodigious correspondence with Cioran and Camil Petrescu, and also tried to engage Eliade in philosophical debates, acknowledging him as his intellectual superior. =Credinţa and Lumea Românească= Also a contributor to newspapers and magazines including România Literară, Cuvântul, and Discobolul, Manoliu is mainly known for his work in Sandu Tudor's Credinţa and Floarea de Foc, the spiritualized and left-leaning Orthodox periodicals. He was the former's editor in 1933–1938, being assigned his own column, Țintar (\\"Merels\\").Ornea, p. 155 He was married to the sister of Ioan Missir, the Botoșani mayor and aspiring novelist, whose work he reviewed in Credinţa. Both Missirs were American-born and Armenian, related to the literary critic Petru Th. Missir. Victor Durnea, \\"Un scriitor adevărat: Ioan Missir\\", in Revista Română (ASTRA), Nr. 1/2005 During his stay there, Manoliu produced articles celebrating irrationalism and criticizing the old school of literary criticism. At Floarea de Foc, he attacked posthumously Titu Maiorescu, the skeptical conservative, claiming to show how Maiorescu had \\"lied to the world\\", and prophesying that he would be soon forgotten. Writing in 2002, philologist Elvira Sorohan commented: \\"[the article] was ridiculous, given who it was that wrote it.\\" Elivira Sorohan, \\"O revistă și colaboratorii ei\\", in Convorbiri Literare, April 2002 Like other \\"new generation\\" men, Manoliu was affiliated with Criterion club. He left during a public scandal, sparked when Credința attacked Criterion host Petru Comarnescu for his homosexuality, preferring to side with Tudor. He advised moderation as the former Criterion members drifted into far-right and far-left politics. In a 1934 article, he reflected all \\"foreign shirts\\", including the brown uniforms of Nazism and the red symbols of communism.Ornea, p. 173 Around 1935, Manoliu also joined Zaharia Stancu's left-leaning paper, Azi, and, according to his own testimony, actually managed it to 1937. Constantin Coroiu, \\"Scriitorii și moara istoriei\\" , in Cultura, nr. 113/2012 His apolitical stance was nonetheless touched by the Orthodoxist politics of Nae Ionescu, the far-right philosopher. By 1936, Manoliu's articles in Credința described Ionescu as a leader of men and a figure of mythical proportions.Ornea, pp. 223–224 A year later, he defended Ionescu's political radicalism against accusations of phyletism, defining nation and nationalism as a \\"community of destiny\\".Ornea, pp. 359–361 In 1945, looking back on the period, the essayist Eugène Ionesco described the \\"good- for-nothing\\" Manoliu as \\"made reactionary\\" and \\"imbecilic\\" by Ionescu.Ornea, pp. 184–185 Leaving Credința in 1938, Manoliu joined Stancu's Lumea Românească daily, serving as the latter's editor for one year. It was mainly an antifascist tribune, grouping together moderate left-wingers and writers affiliated with the underground Romanian Communist Party (Geo Bogza, George Macovescu, Stephan Roll). Mircea Popa, \\"Geo Bogza, insurgentul\\", in Familia, Nr. 11–12/2005 After a stint editing and writing for Petrescu's România (1939–1940), he spent the rest of World War II, to 1944, as editor of, and frequent contributor to, the daily Timpul. He also edited literary and political magazines such as Vremea, Discipolul, Convorbiri Literare, and Familia. Manoliu returned to his work in fiction with Moartea nimănui (\\"Nobody's Death\\", 1939), a novel on moral degeneration, and Domnița Ralú Caragea (1939), a historical retelling of Rallou Karatza's activities.Călinescu, pp. 966, 1030; Crohmălniceanu, p. 630 In 1940, he wrote a six-act historical play, Io, Ștefan Voievod. Featuring Stephen III of Moldavia as its central character, the work was only published in 2006. Liviu Grăsoiu, \\"'Jurnalul literar' continuă\\", in Convorbiri Literare, January 2007 Ultimately graduating university in 1940, he joined the Romanian Writers' Society the following year. =World War II and communism= Following the start of Operation Barbarossa of 1941, in which Romania participated as a Nazi ally, Manoliu penned articles blaming the Soviets for the Katyn massacre, for which the perpetrators long denied responsibility. In 1943, he rejoined Tudor, Noica, Anton Dumitriu and others on a pilgrimage to Cernăuți, where they debated the topic of Orthodox spirituality. Marius Vasileanu, \\"Adevăratul Sandu Tudor\\", in Ziarul Financiar, December 2, 2011 He also wrote Creangă (1944), a monograph on the life of writer Ion Creangă meant for popular consumption. In 1945, the new communist-dominated government banned Manoliu from publishing for a period of five years, accusing him of having written \\"articles with an anti-democratic character\\". In particular, what offended the authorities was his Katyn denunciation. Under the subsequent communist regime, Manoliu was forced into destitution, and retrained to work as a dental technician. He was eventually arrested, in circumstances that he himself failed to clarify, and then sent into internal exile at Costișa in Neamț County, but re-imprisoned after being caught reading (in 1958) a philosophical work by the self-exiled Cioran. Among the sites at which he was detained was Capul Midia, a forced labor camp that was part of the Danube–Black Sea Canal. He was part of a work team that also included fellow writer Barbu Brezianu (with whom he remained close friends), Oni Brătianu and Bani Ghica. Radu Călin Cristea, Firul Ariadnei. Mărturii din labirintul tranziţiei. Mărturia și amintirile lui Barbu Brezianu, Radio Free Europe transcript, April 15, 2000 At Costișa, he wrote diaries, essays and play, most of them still unpublished. He lived in poverty, and was nicknamed Arlechinul (\\"The Harlequin\\") for the patches on his clothes. As he remained barred from publishing fiction, Manoliu turned to translation, winning acclaim in this field. Reportedly, he was still snubbed by Stancu, by then the Romanian Writers' Union, but won his first contract with Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, taking over for Eugen Barbu. In 1967, it won him the Romanian Writers' Union. He completed a single-handed translation of Joseph and His Brothers, which ran at 1220 pages. Other authors whom he rendered into Romanian include Jacques Bainville, Adelbert von Chamisso, Pierre Corneille, Ferenc Körmendi, D. H. Lawrence, Johannes Linnankoski, Jack London, and Jean Racine. He was steeped in philosophy, commenting on the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger and others. He spent his last three years at Mogoșoaia and, traumatized by his wife's suicide, cut himself off from his family. Novels and diaries Manoliu alternated between essays and novels, the latter a blend of fiction with metaphysically-oriented essays. As noted by literary historian George Călinescu, his debut with the Jewish-themed Rabbi Haies Reful, taking place in a Moldavian market town at the dawn of the 20th century,Crohmălniceanu, p. 498 is \\"confusing and lyrical\\".Călinescu, p. 966 According to critic Nicolae Florescu, in this work and some of the later ones, Manoliu presents an epic fresco which confronts the tolerance of Romanians to the intolerance of foreigners and minorities. Tezaur bolnav is inspired by André Gide, and focuses of the \\"Gidean\\" intellectual youth. As noted by critic Ovid Crohmălniceanu, its protagonists \\"always seem inclined to ask themselves questions as to the purpose of existence.\\" Florescu sees Manoliu himself as possessed by a wish to declare his innermost thoughts and sentiments, a \\"sincerity that borders on the ridiculous\\". In Moartea nimănui, Manoliu's style is heavily indebted to Gide, but mainly recalls the proletarian literature of George Mihail Zamfirescu and Carol Ardeleanu. Set in the sugar mill of Chitila and in homeless shelters, it shows young intellectuals driven to destitution and despair, and introduces Mortaru, a homosexual character. According to Călinescu, its experimental nature \\"alienates the reader.\\" This reading is supported by Crohmălniceanu, who notes: \\"The speculative torment is not without drama, but is greatly harmed by the lyricism of the exposition, which is all too impersonal.\\" Political repression pushed Manoliu away from his work as a novelist, but allowed him to carry on as a diarist. As noted by Florescu in 2008, his 1970s Jurnal de peregrin (\\"Pilgrim's Diary\\") \\"provides one of the most dramatic images of the aging intellectual, taken with the notion of failure and the awareness of his demise\\", a \\"despairing monologue, with no possibility of evading into the much richer past.\\" Also according to Florescu, these last work mark Manoliu's return to his early idols, Ortega y Gasset and Mihai Eminescu.

He stayed out of trouble here. He used to talk about the streets, his friends getting into a lot of trouble. He'd say, 'I don't want that life. I don't want to be in prison the rest of my life.'\\" It was at the facility that he developed an interest in basketball and went on to star at Hillhouse High School and The Winchendon School. Afterward, he spoke to juvenile offenders in the program, urging them to set high goals. Cothran graduated from the University of Rhode Island in May 2010 with a degree in sociology. The New Haven Register called him an inspiration for troubled inner city children. Cothran said he was \\"at a loss for words\\" to receive his diploma because he was never strong academically. On May 31, 2012 at 10:23 p.m, Cothran was sitting in a car near an empty parking lot in his hometown of New Haven, Connecticut when bullets were fired. He was not hit directly but was struck with a bullet in his forehead that ricocheted off the dashboard. After being struck, Cothran managed to go to a gas station across the street for help. It was unclear whether or not the shooting was related to the shooting death of Cothran's cousin in September 2011. He returned to playing basketball two weeks later.

He is most commonly remembered as the judge who sat on the Sellafield cancer litigation, described as \\"one of the longest, most complicated and most expensive civil actions ever heard before a British court.\\" Early life French was born in 1925, the son of Reverend Reginald French, who had won a Military Cross in World War I for rescuing wounded soldiers under enemy fire, and was later named honorary chaplain to the Queen. He won an academic scholarship first to Denstone College, and then later to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read law. His university studies were interrupted by the Second World War, where he service in the Coldstream Guards as a sapper. He was discharged in 1948 with the rank of captain, and returned to Oxford to finish his legal studies. Whilst at Oxford he rowed bow for the Brasenose eight. French was called to the Bar in 1950 as a member of the Inner Temple, and he became a tenant at 1 Crown Office Row. He built a general common law practice in London and on the Midland Circuit. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1966 and acting as leading counsel in the Thalidomide litigation. Whilst still at the bar he served as deputy chairman of Buckinghamshire Quarter Sessions from 1966 to 1971 and as Recorder of Coventry from 1972 to 1979. Judicial career French was appointed as a High Court judge in 1979, and was initially assigned to the Family Division. However he would switch to the Queen's Bench Division three years later. In one of his obituaries, he was described as \\"being invariably calm, decent, unflustered and not liable to be provoked.\\" Not all commentary on French as a judge was quite so flattering. In his book, Privacy and the Press, Joshua Rozenberg noted acidly that as French was dead he was now free to write openly about his conduct of the libel claim brought by Albert Reynolds against the Sunday Times, but then restrained himself to saying \\"all I shall say is that there needs to be a better way of ensuring that judges whose powers are in decline through age or illness do not carry on sitting,\\" and noting that in the Court of Appeal Lord Justice Bingham saw the force in the criticisms made of French's conduct of the trial. Apart from the Sellafield litigation he presided over a number of high-profile libel trials. In 1986 he awarded the London Symphony Orchestra substantial damages over allegations made in Private Eye that its members were \\"drunk, dissolute, unruly and irresponsible\\". Other defamation cases that he presided over included those between Alan Sugar and Terry Venables, Imran Khan and Ian Botham, Graeme Souness and the Mail on Sunday, and Albert Reynolds and the Sunday Times. Hon Mr Justice French also sat as the judge at first instance in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC [1990] 2 QB 697. Although his decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal, it would subsequently be restored by the House of Lords. Family He married once, in 1957, Philippa Price, and she predeceased him in 2001. They had a son and a daughter.

He served as an assistant state Attorney General, a county solicitor, a member of the Alabama House of Representatives, and an Alabama circuit court judge. He was an active defender of Jim Crow segregation as a judge. Biography James Albert Hare Jr. was born May 17, 1906, at Massillon in Dallas County, Alabama. His parents were James Albert Hare and Betty May Kendrick. He received his education through the public schools of Marion Junction and graduated from Marion Military Institute in 1925. He enrolled at the University of Alabama and earned a bachelor of law degree in 1929. Hare served six years as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from Dallas County (1934–1940). He was also appointed as an Alabama assistant Attorney General (1940–1942). He enlisted into the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) as a lieutenant during World War II. He served in the China- Burma-India theatre and was honorably discharged as a lieutenant colonel in 1946. Hare was appointed as circuit solicitor (1946–1954) and later appointed Judge of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Alabama (1954). The jurisdiction of his court covered Bibb, Dallas, Hale, Perry, and Wilcox counties in central Alabama. His civic involvements included membership in the college fraternities of Chi Phi and Phi Delta Phi, a board of trustees member of the Sturdivant Museum and Marion Institute, a board of directors member for the Marion Institute Educational Foundation, and part of the congregation of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Selma. Hare married Katheryn Terrell on September 12, 1942, in Waco, Texas. They had four children - Susan Nowlin Hare, James Albert Hare III, Virginia Terrell Hare, and William Terrell Hare. He died at Selma Hospital on May 20, 1969. He is interred at New Live Oak Cemetery in Selma, Alabama.  Opposition to civil rights  During his tenure as a judge, Hare made efforts to thwart the civil rights movement in Alabama. In July of the Freedom Summer of 1964, Hare issued an injunction forbidding any gathering of three or more people under sponsorship of civil rights organizations. The injunction made it illegal to even talk to more than two people at a time about civil rights or voter registration in Selma, even (and especially) during church services. Because it was an injunction rather than a law, Hare could jail anyone who – in his sole opinion – violated it. As a result, mass meetings were halted and for the remainder of 1964 there were no public civil rights movement events in Selma. Organization efforts were driven deep underground except for the bravest activists, and the movement was paralyzed.

It is the first on-screen confrontation between The Mummy and Frankenstein's monster. It was released on DVD and digital download. Plot summary Dr. Victor Frankenstein is a professor of medicine at an American college. After teaching his students during the morning, he does experiments on stitched together corpses at night. Frankenstein is in a relationship with Naihla Khalil, who also teaches at the same college. Khalil brought an Egyptian mummy back with her from her trip to Egypt. Victor manages to bring his creation to life and the mummy is reanimated at the same time. The two monsters eventually clash. Production Leone was inspired by the Frankenstein comic book by Bernie Wrightson and the monster's muscular build in the film was similar to that of the comic. The director stated that people were taken aback by the monster's long hair in the film, but he said that was how he interpreted a passage of the novel which \\"says that he’s got black locks of hair\\". He also intended Frankenstein's monster to resemble a zombie with rotting flesh. Leone could not use the design from the 1931 Frankenstein film because the copyright is owned by Universal Studios. Leone wanted to make the film be as serious as possible instead of campy films like Freddy vs Jason. The film is the first on-screen confrontation between The Mummy and Frankenstein's monster. The makeup effects were completed by Leone. Michael Juvinall of Horror Society wrote, \\"The mummy looks how the failed 1999 Universal Stephen Sommers' Mummy reboot creature should have looked if it wasn’t a crappy CGI monster.\\" Release The film was released on DVD and digital download on February 10, 2015, by Image Entertainment. The special feature on the DVD is a commentary from the director. Reception Jake Dee of JoBlo.com concluded his mixed review with, \\"Even if I wasn't too keen on the visual aesthetic of Frankenstein's creation, or the drawn-out runtime due to maudlin romance, I found the hyper-violence and inevitable monster showdown (even if it took forever to get there) entertaining enough.\\" JM Willis of Shock Ya! gave the film a C-, stating, \\"I did find it fun even though it was kind of awful.

As head of the department he presided over a period of liberalism in the Chinese press. Biography Zhu was born in Zhijin County, Guizhou province. He joined the Communist Party in 1949, the year the People's Republic of China was founded. He attended Guiyang Normal College. In 1964, during the Socialist Education Movement, Zhu was expelled from the Communist Party and sent to perform manual labour. Zhu was politically rehabilitated in 1978, then became head of the party organization in Guiyang, then promoted to provincial First Secretary of Guizhou. During his tenure in Guizhou he was known for the significant progress the province made in economic development; the annual increase in industrial output increased by 18%. Zhu's achievements were noted by national leaders such as Hu Yaobang. In April 1985, Zhu was named Guizhou party chief (top official of the province). In August that year, he was transferred to Beijing to serve as head of the Propaganda Department, becoming one of the top deputies of party General Secretary Hu Yaobang. During Zhu's term as propaganda department head, he spearheaded propaganda policy of \\"Generous, Tolerant, Relaxed\\" (), significantly loosening the ideological shackles of the communist state and leading to increased liberalization in the arts and in academic institutions. However, Zhu's fortunes and the policies he espoused were short-lived. Mirroring the fate of his patron Hu Yaobang, in February 1987 Zhu was dismissed from his propaganda post during the anti-bourgeois liberalization campaign. Though disgraced, he was given a position at the State Council Rural Development Centre; during the 13th Party Congress held in 1987, he failed to secure election to the party's Central Committee; that is, he appeared on the candidate list but did not receive enough votes for confirmation. However, in 1988, reformist Premier Zhao Ziyang named Zhu the first-ranked vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Zhu was yet again purged for supporting the student movement. He was expelled for the second time in his life from the Communist Party of China. He retreated from public view thereafter and died on May 9, 2010 in Beijing.

E. P. Thompson saw him as one of three outstanding figures in the early English working-class movement.E. P. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class (1963), p. 851; the other two being Doherty and Gast. Early life Henson was born in Nottingham in 1785, the son of James Henson and Mary, née Gravener.St. Mary's, Nottingham marriage transcripts, 28 January 1782. The only hint of his religious sympathies occurs in a brief acknowledgement to the Wesleyan sect in his writings, which might indicate that he was educated at one of the town's Wesleyan Sunday schools.G. Henson, The civil, political, and mechanical history of the framework-knitters (Nottingham, 1831), p. 250. He was first noticed on 8 October 1808, in the Nottingham Quarter Sessions Records, when as John Gravenor [sic] Henson, he was the subject of a bastardy order for a female child born to Elizabeth Bradwell.Records of the Borough of Nottingham, vol viii, 1800–1835 (Nottingham, 1952), pp. 75–76. Henson married Martha Farnsworth at St Mary's Church, Nottingham, on 23 December 1813.St. Mary's, Nottingham marriage transcripts, 23 December 1813. They are not known to have had any children, and she predeceased him in 1850.Nottingham Review and General Advertiser for the Midland Counties, 26 July 1850, p. 4. A contemporary said \\"he was thick set with a short neck, keen small eyes, and a head very broad at the base, rising angularly to an unusual height.\\"W. Felkin, A History of the Machine-wrought Hosiery and Lace Manufactures (1867), p. xvii. Workers' leader Henson was first apprenticed to the stocking frame, and in about 1802 or 1803 became a journeyman and moved into the lace branch of the trade, the only branch of silk and cotton hosiery to prosper during the war years. An 1809 dispute over an agreed standard of measurement as a basis for payment in the lace branch caused the workmen to approach Henson, presumably seeing him as an articulate spokesman. Later he told a Parliamentary Committee, \\"They compelled me to act, in a good-natured way... they stopped my machine.\\"Report of the Select Committee on Postage (1837–1838), XX (ii), p. 211; R. A. Church and S. D. Chapman, \\"Gravenor Henson and the making of the English working class\\", in: E. L. Jones and G. E. Mingay (eds), Land, labour and population in the Industrial revolution (1967), pp. 133–134. Led by Henson, the men struck in 1810, but due to weakening exports, the strike collapsed, and he probably spent some time in prison in 1810 as a result of the part he had played. Rising fear of revolutionary movements was creating conditions unfavourable to understanding between the burgeoning urban working class and employers, on whom a growing number depended for their employment.R. A. Church, Economic and Social Change in a Midland Town: Victorian Nottingham, 1815–1900 (1966), p. 319. In 1811 Henson tried unsuccessfully to prosecute four hosiery employers under the Combination Acts, which were intended to cover employers as well as workers, and in 1812, as \\"Deputy\\" of The United Committee of Framework Knitters, he made the first of several attempts to obtain parliamentary regulation of the hosiery and lace trades and the organization and cooperation of their workers throughout the country.M. I. Thomis, \\"Gravener Henson: the Man and the Myth\\", in: Transactions of the Thoroton Society, 75 (1971), pp. 91–97; M. Chase, Early Trade Unionism (2000), p. 94. Because of (or in spite of) these activities, he began to be suspected of being connected in some way with the Luddites or even being Ned Ludd himself. As a result, when the writ of habeas corpus was suspended in England in 1817, he was arrested on a warrant signed by the Home Secretary Lord Sidmouth and imprisoned in April for seven months in Coldbath Fields house of correction.Nottingham Review..., 19 November 1852, p. 4. The London Courier noted, \\"This man Henson has long been an object of dread to the well-disposed inhabitants of Nottingham and its neighbourhood, both on account of the leading influence he was thought to have with the Luddites, and his supposed political principles.\\"Quoted in Nottingham Journal, 19 April 1817. Even Francis Place, \\"the radical tailor of Charing Cross\\", accepted the popular view that Henson was in fact \\"King Ludd\\".Place MSS. BM. Add MSS. 27,809 (1876). This confinement in jail, however, gave Henson an alibi for the Pentrich rising on 9 June 1817 and for the weeks preceding the uprising, and he was released in November of that year. Henson later maintained he had urged the Luddites to form \\"clubs and combinations\\" as \\"an alternative means of securing their ends\\", and he claimed that his own life had been threatened repeatedly by some of the more desperate Luddites \\"for counteracting their designs, and for the freedom of language I have used at various times against their practices.\\"Report of the Select Committee on the Emigration of Artisans and the Export of Machinery (1824), VII, evidence of Henson, p. 282; Henson to Lord Sidmouth, H.O.42/166, quoted by J. L. and B. Hammond, The Skilled Labourer (1919), p. 235. Henson later pulled the leg of Francis Place by suggesting to him that Luddism was a put-up job by the government of the day, to give it an excuse for grinding the people under the heel of military despotism. Francis Place solemnly recorded this conspiracy theory as a piece of serious comment.British Museum Additional MSS 27809, Place's account of the years 1815 onwards, p. 18: quoted in M. I. Thomis, The Luddites: Machine Breaking in Regency England (1970), p. 43. E. P. Thompson thought that because Gravener Henson was involved in all the workers' activities of the time, he was most likely involved with Luddism, and that the roles of machine-breaker and Parliamentary petitioner were not incompatible.E. P. Thompson, Postscript to new edition of the Making of the English Working Class (1968), pp. 924–934. R. A. Church and S. D. Chapman, however, felt that the two roles could not have coexisted, and that Henson stood for the more sophisticated approach of the urban radicals, contrasting it with the cruder behaviour of their rural cousins, and that Nottingham, unlike the countryside around it, was a political environment in which he could identify with the radical leadership of the town, and so had no need to resort to machine-breaking.R. A. Church and S. D. Chapman, \\"Gravener Henson and the making of the English working class\\", passim. In 1823 Henson embarked on a campaign to secure parliamentary regulation of the hosiery and lace trades. Together with George White, a Clerk of Committees of the House of Commons, a bill was introduced by Peter Moore, M. P. for Coventry, which Henson hoped would repeal the Combination Acts, and replace them with a virtual charter of workers' rights. This far-sighted scheme had little chance of success, but Henson was able at least to present evidence to the Committee on Artisans and Machinery, which may well have helped to secure their repeal in 1824.S. and B. Webb, The History of Trade Unionism (1894, new ed. 1920), p. 100; Digest of Evidence before the Committee on Artisans and Machinery by George White, 1824. In 1833, lace-machine holders, owners and manufacturers joined together to support Henson (and William Felkin) in an attempt to prohibit the export of lace-making machinery. A committee was formed to prevent the smuggling of machines from England to France. (English producers were particularly anxious about French rivals.) Although the Board of Trade had always refused to grant licences for the export of lace machinery, the government had failed to prosecute breaches of the law. On Henson's authority, the committee took possession of machinery which was being dispatched abroad by a London merchant, who promptly instituted action against Henson for illegal seizure. The funds of the committee were soon exhausted by the ensuing court case, and the campaign to prevent exports of machinery was quickly abandoned.R. A. Church, Economic and Social Change in a Midland Town: Victorian Nottingham 1815–1900, pp. 98–100. It was a failure for Henson, against what he saw as the cruel system of free trade, and which he believed would work to the disadvantage of Britain's workers, if competitors were able to secure access to British technology.R. A. Church, Economic and Social Change in a Midland Town: Victorian Nottingham 1815–1900, pp. 98–100. In later life Henson seems to have distrusted the Chartists, having a poor opinion of their motives and abilities. He thought in 1842 that they were \\"disinterested lecturers and spouters\\". Nottingham Journal, 2 September 1842. He continued to back the framework knitters' attempts in 1843 to obtain a government inquiry into their conditions.Nottingham Journal, 5 May 1843. A lifetime of endeavour in the interests of the working classes, however, produced only a series of disappointments.R. A. Church and S. D. Chapman, \\"Gravener Henson and the making...\\", p. 156. William Cobbett's remark that Henson was one of those men \\"whose offensive conceit, coupled with vulgar ignorance, are sure to do injury to any cause with which they meddle...\\" must in part explain his lack of success, and his later remoteness from public life.W. Cobbett, Political Register, Vol 76 (1832), p. 496. Authorship In 1830 Henson wrote The Civil, Political, and Mechanical History of the Framework-Knitters, Vol 1, but only the one volume, down to 1780, was published, due to a lack of public support. According to William Felkin, this was because of \\"his diffusive manner and some peculiar opinions set forth with needless prominence.\\" He left behind him at his death the manuscripts of Notes of Inventions and Improvements of Lace Machines down to the year 1850, and some (or all) of these were published in an edition of 1970.W. Felkin, A History of... (1867), p. xvi 1970 edition. Death White's 1844 Directory shows him living in Nottingham's Lower Parliament Street with the occupation of \\"writer\\", and the 1851 census records him at 39 Broad Street, aged 64 (sic), with the occupations, \\"Accountant Author Trade\\".W. White, History, Gazetteer and Directory of Nottingham (1844), p. 230; TNA, HO.107/2132.15. He died at Broad Street, aged 67, on 15 November 1852, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Nottingham.Nottingham Review…, 19 November 1852, p. 4;Nottingham Evening Post, 19 February 1910, p.6. Assessment William Felkin (1795–1874), a manufacturer and historian of the lace and hosiery industries who had been mayor of Nottingham in 1851–52, said of him:Felkin, p. xvii (1867). > He had little early education, but afterwards read much. He possessed an > extraordinary memory, and delighted in the histories of manufactures and > commerce. He knew most of the laws of his own country and France regulating > these matters. His first employment was in the stocking frame, then in point > net, and afterwards in bobbin net, and he knew many of those who had > improved those classes of machines. A recent writer places him amongst the > \\"worthies of Nottingham\\".W. H. Wylie, Old and New Nottingham (Nottingham, > 1853), pp. 233–34. Others differed from this, for which his dogmatism and > warm temperament may account. E. P. Thompson suggested, in The Making of the English Working Class (presumably on the basis of Henson's early militancy), that in the history of working-class movements between 1780 and 1832, he was one of three, with John Doherty and John Gast, who were outstanding leaders.E. P. Thompson, The Making..., p. 851 Professor M.I. Thomas thought, in Old Nottingham (1968), that Henson was one of the most important working-class leaders of the first half of the 19th century, and possibly (around 1813–1814) the first full-time paid union official.M. I. Thomas, Old Nottingham (Newton Abbott, 1968), pp. 180–81. References Bibliography *G.

While visiting her parents in Nigeria as a teenager, she acquired poliomyelitis, the side effects of which she lived with throughout her life. She was only saved by an iron lung, introduced to Nigeria by her father Brigadier Norman Brading. An 18-month period of recovery in the Wingfield Hospital (Oxford; now Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre) from the acute phase of her illness meant that she was unable to accept a position to study Medicine at the University of Oxford.

She continued in Bristol, gaining a PhD exploring the function of muscle in the tapeworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), under the supervision of Peter Caldwell.

Her research focussed on the function of smooth muscle, particularly that which controls the contraction of the urinary bladder and urethra. Her early work focussed on the role of ions (particularly chloride) in the regulation of smooth muscle, developing new ways to measure the concentration of ions inside cells. In mid-career, she studied the function of drugs that relax smooth muscle, particularly potassium channel activators, moving on to develop important ties with Urological surgeons in Oxford to form the Oxford Continence Group. Her later work was on the treatment of the unstable urinary bladder, bladder outflow obstruction, anal sphincter function (particularly the role of nitric oxide), the role of the pelvic floor in maintaining urinary continence and the role of Interstitial Cells (of Cajal) in the urogenital tract. =Role in training and education= In the laboratory, Professor Brading was instrumental in training a generation of Urological surgeons in laboratory techniques, and also inspired basic science research. She was particularly proud of her contributions to the study of smooth muscle in Japan, where three of her former DPhil students, postdoctoral researchers or fellows subsequently became professorial heads of department (including Hikaru Hashitani (Nagoya) and Noriyoshi Teramoto (Saga)). She continued regular work in the Oxford Department of Pharmacology until just before her final illness. Her contributions are recognised in at Lady Margaret Hall through a scholarship fund. =Awards and honours= In 2006 she was the first non-clinician to be awarded the St Peter's Medal of the British Association of Urological Surgeons. She was awarded the title of honorary member of the Physiological Society (2008) and honorary Fellowship of the British Pharmacological Society. =Engagement with professional societies= She was an editor for the Journal of Physiology and served on the governing council of the Physiological Society. =Books= * Smooth muscle, with Edith Bülbring, T. Tomita, and A.W. Jones. * Autonomic Nervous System and Its Effectors Personal life In her later life she lived next to the canal in Thrupp, Oxfordshire, where she captained her own narrowboat, assisted by family, friends and colleagues. Alison developed post-polio syndrome meant that she had trouble standing unaided and had breathing problems that progressed as she aged. While still active in scientific research, she acquired pneumonia in September 2010, which, through many months in hospital, she unable to conquer, arguable due to her ongoing post-polio syndrome weakness.

Owing to this good form, he was selected in both of the Gentlemen v Players fixtures at the season's end, representing the Gentlemen (the amateur players). In Lagden's final year at Cambridge, he scored only a single century, an innings of 106 which once again came against Hampshire. In the same time, he was serving as captain of the Cambridge University Hockey Club. His hockey was played as a centre half-back, and he represented England in several internationals during both 1913 and 1914. Military service and later life In the First World War, which saw his brother killed in action, Lagden served as an officer in the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own). He reached the substantive rank of captain and the temporary rank of major by the war's end, and was also awarded the Military Cross. After the war, Lagden moved to Bengal, India, setting himself up as a businessman in Calcutta. He remained involved in cricket, and in December 1926 played one final first- class match, captaining the \\"Europeans of the East\\" against a touring English team.

() was a co-operative bank in Ireland associated with the Sinn Féin movement, which operated from August 1908 to October 1921. The Sinn Féin Bank is sometimes confused with the National Land Bank, established as a friendly society in 1919 with Dáil backing and premises at 5 Harcourt Street. Foundation The bank was established in 1908 to \\"carry out the business of banker and bill discounter, and of Dealer in Stocks, Shares, Bonds, Debentures and other Securities to assist in the development of Irish industries\\". Its founding council comprised George W. Russell, Arthur Griffith, and P. T. Daly. In 1910 it purchased headquarters at 6 Harcourt Street for £575, leasing the upper floors to the Sinn Féin party, from where the Sinn Féin newspaper was edited. A contemporary wrote, \\"we do not envy the man who has the job of persuading [nationalists] that the new Sinn Fein bank (which we take it will be established without complying with the requirements of British law) is a secure nest for his savings as the Bank of Ireland\\". War of Independence When the First Dáil proclaimed an Irish Republic in 1919, it opened a \\"Trustees of Dáil Éireann\\" account at the Sinn Féin Bank for a \\"Self Determination Fund\\" of donations from supporters. The Department of Finance of the Dáil ministry under Michael Collins was also in 6 Harcourt Street in 1919.Evans 2012, pp.103–4 Kathleen Kearney met her husband Stephen Behan while working at the Sinn Féin Bank. Several times in 1919 and 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP) raided and ordered the closure of 6 Harcourt Street. The bank's bookkeeping was deliberately complex, with proxy names for accounts held by republican leaders. In 1923 it was claimed that the authorities \\"were unable to make head or tail out of\\" the books it had confiscated. On 29 November 1919, the martial law authorities ordered the bank to close, and on 2 January 1920, the DMP went to enforce this order. Based on cheques recovered in a DMP raid on 6 Harcourt Street on 27 February 1920, the Attorney-General for Ireland on 2 March 1920 ordered Hibernian Bank and Munster and Leinster Bank to give evidence at a private inquiry into their relations with the Sinn Féin Bank.Evans 2012, pp.108–110 The inquiry was led by Alan Bell, a resident magistrate, as part of his broader, mostly secret, search for Dáil funds. The banks' officials were reluctant to co-operate.Evans 2012, pp.124–6 On 26 March 1920, Bell was taken from a tram and shot by Collins' IRA \\"Squad\\".Evans 2012, pp.127–9 The bank secured through the courts the return of £8000 confiscated in the raid. On 29 November 1920, the bank's office was damaged when the authorities took up the floorboards and blew open a secret underground safe. On 14 March 1921, the bank's manager, David Kelly, brother of Sinn Féin TD Thomas Kelly, was killed by crossfire on Great Brunswick Street. In the Second Dáil on 18 August 1921, Séamus Dwyer claimed \\"All the monies invested [in the Sinn Féin Bank] were in jeopardy\\". Liquidation On 19 October 1921, the bank passed a resolution to wind up the company and appointing William O'Brien Hishon liquidator. The confiscated books were returned to Hishon \\"in a sack\\" after the June 1921 truce ended the Anglo-Irish War, and he set about deciphering them. Michael Collins told the Second Dáil on 26 April 1922 that the Sinn Féin Bank was \\"now in Liquidation\\"; of £201,944 8s. 4d. Trustees Accounts of Dáil funds, £1,660 7s. 5d. was in the Sinn Féin Bank and the rest in the London Office. By December 1923, Hishon had received £3,501 in moneys due and paid out £2,685, leaving a balance of £815. The provisional government established under the Anglo-Irish Treaty merged the institutions of the Irish Republic into those of the Dublin Castle administration into the new Irish Free State. On 16 April 1923, the Free State Chancery Division ordered the winding up of the Sinn Féin Bank company, appointing Donal O'Connor as liquidator. In August 1923 the court authorised O'Connor to auction off the Harcourt Street premises, which were \\"almost derelict\\". (In March 1966 they were bought by Conradh na Gaeilge.) The court ruled in December 1923 that the 1921 winding-up resolution was invalid, and ordered Hishon to transfer the £815 balance to O'Connor. The bank was dissolved by the High Court in March 1925 and its assets were liquidated. In April 1926, Dublin County Council, presented with a demand for £113 for damage caused by the DMP raids in 1919–21, voted 13–1 not to pay. The liquidation was completed by 1931 after proceedings costing £2,406 8s. 6d. The republican Dáil had deposited money with the bank and the Irish Free State, as its legal successor, received £1,198 10s. 9d. at the standard writedown of 50%, forgoing its preferential claim under the Dáil Éireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924. Other creditors received £2,620 7s. 0d. at the same rate. In 1933, the Free State voted £2,045 in public funds to repay creditors for the shortfall.
