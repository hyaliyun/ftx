The satellite is also referred to as \\"Luch\\". It is believed to be a signals intelligence satellite. Launch Olymp-K was launched on 28 September 2014. The Proton-M rocket with a Briz-M upper stage launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome launchpad 81/24 in Kazakhstan at 20:23 UTC. After four burns of the Briz-M upper stage it was placed into geosynchronous transfer orbit. In a press release on 28 September 2014, Roscosmos referred to the satellite as \\"Luch\\". Manoeuvres Following its launch, the Olymp-K satellite made several manoeuvres before settling at 18.1¬∞ West longitude around 4 April 2015. The satellite was then positioned in an orbit directly between Intelsat 901, which was located at 18¬∞ West, and Intelsat 7, located at 18.2¬∞ West. It remained in geosynchronous orbit between the satellites for five months. At times, Olymp-K performed colocation manoeuvres, positioning itself around 10 kilometres from the satellites. In September 2015, the satellite was manoeuvred to a position at 24.4¬∞ West, adjacent to the Intelsat 905 satellite. While JFCC SPACE spokesperson and Air Force Captain Nicholas Mercurio said there were three occasions where the Olymp-K satellite had come within five kilometres of another satellite, an industry source indicated that Air Force data were predictions based on drift rates and that Olymp-K's approach had not brought it closer than 10 kilometres to the Intelsat satellites. As of December 2019, the satellite is located at 70.6¬∞ East Longitude. In 2018 France criticised Russia for manoeuvring the satellite close to the French Athena-Fidus satellite. Florence Parly, the French defence minister, accused Russia of \\"an act of espionage\\". Analysis and response Intelsat criticized the maneouvres, with Intelsat General president Kay Sears saying that \\"this is not normal behavior and we're concerned.\\" Attempts by Intelsat to contact the owners of the Russian satellite directly and via the US Defense Department did not receive a response. Members of the space community consider the incident to be among the first documented instances of a foreign military satellite approaching a commercial operator in such a manner. In a 5 October analysis of Russian proximity and rendezvous operations written for the Space Review, Secure World Foundation technical adviser Brian Weeden highlighted Olymp-K's movements. In his paper, he wrote that many Russian space program observers believe the satellite mission involves signals intelligence or communications. Observers also speculated whether there is a connection between Olymp-K and the Yenisey A1 (Luch 4) experimental satellite. A Kommersant report indicated that Olymp-K would provide secure governmental communications as well as electronic intelligence (SIGINT). Sources have also reported that the satellite has an onboard laser communications device and will provide the GLONASS system with navigation correction signals. Olymp-K's maneouvres were reported to have led to several classified meetings within the U.S. Defense Department.

Distance and proper motion Based upon an annual parallax shift of 12.30 mas which is taken during opposing points of the Earth's orbit of the sun (with compensation for its eccentricity), the star is about 265 light years away. Its (proper) motion has a net vector at present of receding from the Sun, at +15.4 km/s. Characteristics This is an evolved G-type giant star with a stellar classification of G7 III. It is a red clump star, which means it is generating energy through helium fusion at its core. The star has an estimated 1.81 times the mass of the Sun and it has expanded to 11 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 69 times the Sun's luminosity from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,150 K.

It is one of the best known examples of indeterminate problems in the early history of mathematics. The problem appears as the final problem in Zhang Qiujian suanjing (Problem 38 in Chapter 3). However, the problem and its variants have appeared in the medieval mathematical literature of India, Europe and the Arab world. The name \\"Hundred Fowls Problem\\" is due to the Belgian historian Louis van Hee. Problem statement The Hundred Fowls Problem as presented in Zhang Qiujian suanjing can be translated as follows: : \\"Now one cock is worth 5 qian, one hen 3 qian and 3 chicks 1 qian. It is required to buy 100 fowls with 100 qian. In each case, find the number of cocks, hens and chicks bought.\\" Mathematical formulation Let x be the number of cocks, y be the number of hens, and z be the number of chicks, then the problem is to find x, y and z satisfying the following equations: : x + y +z = 100 : 5x + 3y + z/3 = 100 Obviously, only non-negative integer values are acceptable. Expressing y and z in terms of x we get : y = 25 ‚àí (7/4)x : z = 75 + (3/4)x Since x, y and z all must be integers, the expression for y suggests that x must be a multiple of 4. Hence the general solution of the system of equations can be expressed using an integer parameter t as follows: : x = 4t : y = 25 ‚àí 7t : z = 75 + 3t Since y should be a non-negative integer, the only possible values of t are 0, 1, 2 and 3. So the complete set of solutions is given by :(x,y,z) = (0,25,75), (4,18,78), (8,11,81), (12,4,84). of which the last three have been given in Zhang Qiujian suanjing. However, no general method for solving such problems has been indicated, leading to a suspicion of whether the solutions have been obtained by trial and error. The Hundred Fowls Problem found in Zhang Qiujian suanjing is a special case of the general problem of finding integer solutions of the following system of equations: : x + y + z = d : ax + by + cz = d Any problem of this type is sometime referred to as \\"Hundred Fowls problem\\". Variations Some variants of the Hundred Fowls Problem have appeared in the mathematical literature of several cultures. In the following we present a few sample problems discussed in these cultures. =Indian mathematics= Mahavira's Ganita-sara-sangraha contains the following problem: :Pigeons are sold at the rate of 5 for 3, sarasa-birds at the rate of 7 for 5, swans at the rate of 9 for 7, and peacocks at the rate of 3 for 9 (panas). A certain man was told to bring 100 birds for 100 panas. What does he give for each of the various kinds of birds he buys? The Bakshali manuscript gives the problem of solving the following equations: :x + y + z = 20 :3x + (3/2)y + (1/2)z = 20 =Medieval Europe= The English mathematician Alcuin of York (8th century, c.735-19 May 804 AD) has stated seven problems similar to the Hundred Fowls Problem in his Propositiones ad acuendos iuvenes. Here is a typical problem: :If 100 bushels of corn be distributed among 100 people such that each man gets 3 bushels, each woman 2 bushels and each child half a bushel, then how many men, women and children were there? =Arabian mathematics= Abu Kamil (850 - 930 CE) considered non-negative integer solutions of the following equations: :x + y + z = 100 :3x + (/20)y+ (1/3)z = 100.

The polytechnic offers National Diplomas and Higher National Diplomas in Art and Design (Fashion Design and Clothing Technology, and General Art), Business (Accountancy, Business Administration, Human Resource Management, Marketing, Mass Communication, Office Technology Management and Production Operations Management), Engineering (Agriculture and Bio-environmental Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Foundry Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering and Welding and Fabrication) and Applied Sciences (Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics and Hospitality and Tourism Management).https://mydspg.edu.ng/schools.php  History  The Delta State Polytechnic was established by the Delta State Polytechnic Ogwashi-Uku Law, 2002. The Polytechnic officially opened on Thursday January 23 when the second executive governor of Delta State James Onanefe Ibori formally inaugurated the school. The establishment of a new polytechnic at Ogwashi-Uku was not without challenges. Before this time, there had been cries by the indigenes of the community for the reopening of Ogwashi-Uku polytechnic which had earlier been closed in 1986 by the then Military Administrator Lt. Colonel Jerry Useni, four years after its establishment. The closure was seen as manifestly unfair as the Edo State University (now AAU) which was established at the same time as Ogwashi-Uku Polytechnic was not affected. The work done by Michael Okonjo, who was then the Chairman, the House committee on Education and that of his brother, late Isaac Okonjo who was the Secretary to the Bendel State government in ensuring the establishment of the Ogwashi-Uku polytechnic had been undone by a military decree. Unhappy with this development, the people continued to fight for the reopening of the polytechnic. With the advent of democracy, the fight gathered momentum. On the forefront of the fight to reopen the Polytechnic were Chukwuka Benjamin Okonjo, the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku, Chief Oba Ilechie and other stake holders like Pascal Nwaorah, late Kisito Ilechie and many others. In early 2002, the State Government in response to the yearning of the people decided to establish a new polytechnic. However to ensure equity, the Delta State Polytechnic Oghara and Delta State Polytechnic Ozoro were also established. The Delta State Polytechnic, Ogwashi-Uku begun academic activities in 2003 with a modest population of about 200 students, in three departments namely: Accountancy, Mechanical Engineering and Fashion & Clothing Technology under the first rector of the Polytechnic, now Prof. J.E. O. Ovri. The Polytechnic at this time operated out of the former Delta Preparatory Primary School premises along Isah Road, Ogwashi-Uku with the Motto: Creativity for Development until 2004 when it moved to the former party secretariat (now Campus B which currently houses department of Fashion & Clothing Technology) along Ogwashi- Uku/Azagba road. In early 2005, the Polytechnic Rectory was moved to the Polytechnic Guest House at Kwale Junction. With the donation of a large piece of land measuring 2 km by 1 km by the host community and subsequently designated as the main campus (permanent site), the polytechnic moved the department of mechanical engineering to the main campus. By 2007, relocation of the Rectory, the Registry and other major department to the main campus had been completed. Since the establishment of the school, three substantive Rectors have been appointed. They include: ¬∑ Dr. J.E.O. Ovri: November 2002 ‚Äì November 2006 ¬∑ Professor A.O. Egwunyenga: August 2007 ‚Äì August 2011 ¬∑ Dr. (Mrs.) E.N. Mogekwu: March 2012 to date . Prof.(Mrs.) Stella Chiemeke:2017- to date ¬∑ During any interregnum, deputy rectors functioned as Acting Rectors. Those who served in acting capacity include: ¬∑ Mr. J.U. Akajagbor: Nov 2006 ‚Äì August 2007 ¬∑ Mr. S.E. Oseafiana: Aug 2011 ‚Äì March 2012 ¬∑ Mr Edafe John Atajeromavwo 2016 = Substantive Rectors = Professor James Ovri-2003-2007 (Pioneering Development Efforts) Prof. J.E.O. Ovri was the pioneer rector. Under his administration, the polytechnic moved the institution from the rented former D.P.P.S building to what is now known as Campus B, Campus C and the Permanent site. The relocation of the school is a testament of the rector‚Äôs vision, and proactiveness. Aside these, it involved considerable repairs and refurnishing of the old buildings that had been abandoned for decades. Again new buildings which now constitute part of Office Technology Management (OTM) and Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM) were constructed. In the academic sphere, Prof. Ovri ensured that the institution maintained very high standard. Under his stewardship, the polytechnic successfully expanded its NBTE approved programmes from the initial three to six. The programmes were not only approved but listed in the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). The programmes include Accountancy (code-59972A), Business Administration (code-59975k), Fashion Design and Clothing Technology (5996G), Catering and Hotel Management (code-59977C), Mechanical Engineering (code-59978J) and Welding and Fabrication (code-59979F). Mr AkajagborJ.U assumed duties as acting Rector at the expiration of Prof. Ovri‚Äôs tenure. As acting Rector, Mr Akajagbor consolidated on the programmes and vision of his boss. It is on record, that Mr Akajagbor oversaw the relocation of the rectory to the permanent site. More importantly, Mr Akajagbor continued with the expansion of academic programmes of the polytechnic by successfully piloting the successful accreditation of Mass Communication and Fine Art. Professor Andy Egwunyenga (2007‚Äì2011) The appointment of Prof. Andy Egwunyenga in August 2007 as Rector of Delta State Polytechnic, Ogwashi-Uku began a new era in the annals of the institution. Like his predecessor, Prof Egwunyenga recognised the need to develop the polytechnic‚Äôs academic, and infrastructure. In the academic front, the polytechnic organized training seminars for staff. More importantly, Professor Egwunyenga expanded the programmes available in the Polytechnic by successfully securing accreditation for HND programmes in Accountancy, Fashion Design and Clothing Technology, Hospitality and Tourism Management, and ND in Computer Science as well as Maths and Statistics. Furthermore, accreditation visitations were made for the following programmes: National Diploma Programmes in Science Laboratory Technology: Tourism: Textile Technology and Insurance. The Higher National Diploma Programmes (HND): Business Administration: Mass Communication: Sculpture, Graphics and Painting. The Polytechnic also created a school of part time studies not just to boost internally generated revenue but to afford aspiring student the opportunity of acquiring polytechnic education. In an attempt to secure the institution, Prof Egwunyenga constructed a fence from one end of the institution to the other with the school gate properly tucked at the middle. An upgrade and re- equipping of certain departments like department of hotel and tourism management, department of welding and fabrication, and the school library to NBTE standards was carried out. Besides, the polytechnic under the management of Prof Egwunyenga commenced the construction of Lecture Hall complex a building made up of four large classrooms and about 18 offices. The Polytechnic was also a beneficiary of AGIP and TETFUND infrastructural projects, like the ICT building, the AGIP halls among others. Part of the institution was also landscaped. In furtherance of the Polytechnic goal of educating its graduate in job creation, Prof. Egwunyenga successfully initiated the establishment of Student‚Äôs Resource and Entrepreneurial Development Centre. Mr Oseafiana as deputy rector began to function as the Acting Rector. As acting Rector, Mr Steve Oseafiana consolidated the gains under Professor Egwunyenga.

Since 2016 is the Director of the newly created Lomonosov MSU regenerative medicine institute.  Scientific achievements  Studies of mechanisms of hormonal regulation and intracellular signaling. In the early 70s, while working at the Department of animal biochemistry of the Faculty of biology at MSU, V. A. Tkachuk published his first papers on the mechanisms of membrane hormone receptors functioning (glucagon, adrenaline and histamine), regulation of synthesis and hydrolysis cAMP by adenylate-cyclase and phosphoesterase. This research was conducted under the guidance of the department founder, academician S. E. Severin, and became a pioneering research not only in the USSR, but in the whole world. V. A. Tkachuk and his coauthors are also credited research priority on determining the mechanisms of inhibition and activation of adenylate-cyclase by adenylyl nucleotides and nucleosides. In the 80s, as the head of molecular endocrinology lab of the All-Union cardiological research center, V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues researched the role of various G-proteins in adenylate-cyclase activity regulation and Ca2+\\\\- dependent channels in myocardium, vessel, endothelial, smooth muscle cells and platelets. This research determined the molecular mechanisms of G-proteins‚Äô influence on the development of both cell hypersensitivity and cell tolerance to catecholamine and medication. It was revealed that cell hormone sensitivity deviation developed alongside hypertension, ischemia or myocardial infarction. In the same period, more research under V. A. Tkachuk's direction determined the mechanism of hypoxia's influence on cell's hormone sensitivity. It was revealed that during hypoxia phosphoinositide signaling is activated in endothelial cells, which leads to the activation of protein kinase C triggering the endocytosis of b-adrenergic receptors, which in turn leads to the cells developing insensitivity to catecholamines. During deep hypoxia and anoxia ATF- and ADF- hydrolyzing ferments disappear from the surface of endothelial cells, which leads to enhanced aggregation of platelets and endothelium hormone secretion. In the 90s, a group directed by V. A. Tkachuk published a number of papers on stretching receptors‚Äô involvement in specific regulation of gene expression in vessel cells. It was demonstrated that when a single smooth muscle cell is rhythmically stretched, it shows increased expression of a number of genes (caldesmon, calpomin, Œ±-actine, smooth muscle myosin), along with increased proliferation ability. Discovery and research of T-Cadherin functions In the early of the 90s, while studying blood cells, V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues discovered that calcium ions get mobilized in platelets under the influence of lipoproteins, which leads to their aggregation. This effect is more pronounced under the influence of adrenaline. Around the same time it was discovered that Ca2+ is mobilized in smooth muscle cells (SMC) under the influence of angiotensin and endothelin. Using a SMC culture more fitting for experiments, the researchers managed to demonstrate that low density lipoproteins are capable of stimulating Ca2+ to exit endoplasmic reticulum. This effect occurs without involving the classic ApoB/E receptor (Goldstein and Brown received a Nobel prize in 1986 for discovering the ApoB/E receptor). To identify this new lipoprotein-binding receptor, it was purified and segregated. After that it was classified as T-Cadherin ‚Äì a protein from the group of cadherins responsible for hemophilic intracellular interaction. During further research V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues found out that unlike the other classical cadherins (N-, E-, VE- cadherin), T-cadherin does not bypass intracellular adhesion, but instead causes the cells to repel each other and is involved in the cell migration and cytoskeleton restructuring. Further research revealed that T-cadherin is a navigational receptor what helps migrating cells and growing blood vessels avoid certain tissues and that linking lipoproteins with T-cadherin can disrupt angiogenesis and affect heart and vessel remodeling. It was later determined that T-cadherin expressed in endothelial cells is able to regulate endothelium permeability and is part of tumor angiogenesis and growth, as well as melanoma metastasis. Research of the biological functions of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) Since early 90s V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues (E. V. Parfyonova, R. Sh. Bibilashvili, S. P. Domogatskiy, A. Bobik and others) have been studying the molecular mechanisms of blood vessel growth. In particular, a lot of research was focused on the role of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (Urokinase, uPA) in angiogenesis and vessel remodeling. It was revealed that an increased expression of uPA and its receptor (uPAR) occurred in damaged vessel cells. This process was accompanied by increased taxis of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, as well as narrowing of the lumen of the vessel, but if the uPA was suppressed by counteractive antibodies, the intensity of this process was reduced. It turned out that enhanced expression of uPA caused proliferation of vessel cells and stimulated the synthesis of oxidative stress and inflammation proteins. V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues have also for the first time showed urokinase's ability to transport itself into the core and interact with transcriptional factors that regulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and their transformation into miofibroblasts. The latest research showed that the urokinase system in the vessels was necessary for determining the growth and branching trajectory of the capillaries, i.e. it performs a navigational function. V. A. Tkachuk's research has revealed some interesting results regarding the role of uPA in directional cell migration. It was determined that uPA connects with uPAR and this complex concentrates on the leading edge of the cell - on the surface that is closest to the chemoattractant. Later research on uPA's significance in migration processes revealed that its concentration on the leading edge of the cell allows for local destruction of matrix proteins and facilitates migration. This process is realized through activation of plasminogen and starting fibrinolysis, as well as through the stimulating effect uPA has on MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity. These results formed the basis of the development of a drug for therapeutic angiogenesis via uPA gene delivery to the tissues affected by ischemia, as well the creation of the ‚ÄúUpicor‚Äù ‚Äì a drug used to treat chronic ischemia of lower limbs. Research of the role of mesenchyme stem cells in tissue regeneration V. A. Tkachuk directs active research on the mechanisms of physiological renewal, tissue and organ regeneration and reparation, as well as the role of mesenchyme stem cells (MSC) of various tissues in this process. It was discovered that MSC is able to induce blood vessel and nerve growth during damaged tissues recovery. It was also revealed that the stimulating effect these cells have is caused not only by their secretion of soluble proteins (growth factors, cytokines and chemokines), but also by their secretion of extracellular vesicles. During the ascertainment of the mechanisms of MSC's effects on tissue regeneration and reparation, active study was being conducted on the effects hypoxia and inflammation occurring alongside many diseases have on biological activity of this kind of cells. It was discovered that angiogenic factor production in MSC is activated under the effects of hypoxia, and that cells produce immunomodulating cytokines (including immunosuppressant cytokines) under the conditions of inflammation. The results of this research opens up new approaches for treatments of infection and systemic disease, as well as organ and tissue transplantation. A line of gene therapy drugs was developed on the basis of fundamental research conducted under V. A. Tkachuk's direction. These drugs are designed to stimulate blood vessel growth and peripheral nerves recovery after trauma. V. A. Tkachuk is the author and coauthor of 330 articles published in peer- reviewed scientific journals, 32 patents and over 20 monographs. Among his students there are 8 doctors and 36 doctors of philosophy, many of which are the leading specialists in their fields in Russia and the world.  Teaching career  During his work at the Department of animal biochemistry in the 70s, V. A. Tkachuk created a training course ‚Äì ‚ÄúMolecular endocrinology‚Äù. This course is to this day studied by the students of the Faculty of biology of MSU. V. A. Tkachuk during a lecture on molecular nanomedicine. V. A.

It aims to produce four things; signs, wooden pallets, print & mail and fulfilment. History The company is a division of national charity Royal British Legion Industries (RBLI), which was founded in 1919 as Industrial Settlements Inc. RBLI's mission was to help veterans from the First World War during their rehabilitation. The company had taken possession of Preston Hall in Aylesford and was providing care to tuberculous ex-servicemen. Some of the men found that having something to do whilst recuperating, helped not only to pass the time, but also to help engage their brains and bodies. This is how the company's manufacturing division, now Britain's Bravest Manufacturing Company, was born. Britain's Bravest Manufacturing Company currently has two factories, one in Kent and another in Surrey which manufactures the same products in the range. Previously known simply as RBLI's social enterprise, the division was rebranded as Britain's Bravest Manufacturing Company in April 2016. The factory in Aylesford operates from a site and its aim is to provide veterans with long-term careers. Some of the workers arrive directly from the forces whilst some have spent some time in the civilian world before going to BBMC. Ethos The company is run on a social care ethos with the intent and focus being on the ex-service men and women who work in the manufacturing side. They produce signs, wooden pallets and print & mailing items. In 2015‚Äì2016, the company turnover was ¬£5 million, though this a surplus and was re-invested in the company rather being seen as profit. The signs that the company produce have mostly been used on the UK railway network with Network Rail being the most numerous consumer (with Railtrack and British Rail before it) in a relationship that spans 25 years. In the financial year 2015‚Äì2016, BBMC supplied 110 signs and made ¬£493,000 from Network Rail. The market for signs has changed in recent years with 60% of signs manufactured used by the railway industry and 40% for the road industry. The main aim of Britain's Bravest Manufacturing Company is to provide work to ex-service personnel and disabled people, however they also promote other causes of the main RBLI charity including LifeWorks, an employment support programme which helps veterans around the UK to find work in various industries.

She is well known for her work in the military intelligence wing of the army. She had recently appeared in a short film titled 'Voice of an Independent Indian' available on YouTube. Childhood Rajamani was born in Rangoon, Burma (present day Myanmar). Her father owned a gold mine and was one of the richest Indians in Rangoon. Her family was a staunch supporter of the Indian freedom movement and also contributed money to the movement. As a 16 year old, inspired by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose‚Äôs speech at Rangoon, she donated all her jewellery to the INA. Realizing that the young girl might have donated the jewellery naively, Netaji visited her house to return it. However, Rajamani was adamant that he use it for the army. Impressed by her determination, he christened her Saraswathi. Work at the Indian National Army In 1942, Rajamani was recruited to the Rani of Jhansi regiment of the INA and was part of the army‚Äôs military intelligence wing. For almost two years, Rajamani and some of her female colleagues masqueraded as boys and gathered intelligence. While posing as a boy, her name was Mani. Once, one of her colleagues was caught by the British troops. To rescue her, Rajamani infiltrated the British camp dressed as a dancer. She drugged the British officers who were in-charge and freed her colleague. While they were escaping, Rajamani was shot on the leg by a British guard but she still managed to avoid capture. Her work in the army ended when Netaji disbanded the INA after World War II. Later years After World War II, Rajamani‚Äôs family gave away all their wealth, including the gold mine, and returned to India. In 2005, a newspaper reported that she was living in Chennai and although sustained by freedom fighters pension, she was struggling to make both ends meet. She appealed to the Tamil Nadu State Government for help. The then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalithaa provided assistance to her in the form of a gift of 5 lakh and a rent-free housing board flat. She has donated insignia to the INA gallery of the Netaji Subhash Birthplace National Museum in Cuttack, Odisha. In 2016, the EPIC Channel featured her story in the television series Adrishya.  Death  Freedom fighter Shri Saraswathi Rajamani died of cardiac arrest on January 13, 2018.

The Lords found that a gay couple living together could be seen as a family for the purposes of housing law, and that a family relationship did not require either a blood relationship (as between parent and child) or marriage (at the time, neither marriage nor civil partnerships were available for same-sex couples). Under the Rent Act (and later amendments under the Housing Act 1998), protected tenants could pass on their tenancy to spouses or cohabiting family members upon their death. The claimant in this case, Martin Fitzpatrick, had lived with his partner John Thompson from 1976 until his death in 1994, having met in 1969. Thompson had rented the flat from 1972 onwards. The law allows for succession in a tenancy agreement for spouses, those \\"living with him or her as a husband or wife\\", and members of one's family who have resided in the flat for at least two years before the tenant's death. The Court of Appeal rejected Mr Fitzpatrick's initial appeal, citing the precedent of Harrogate Borough Council v Simpson where the Court of Appeal determined that \\"living together as husband and wife\\" did not extend to a homosexual couple. The Court of Appeal decision expressed considerable sympathy for the appellant, citing his selfless dedication to caring for his partner for many years, but stated that it was the job of Parliament to change the law to extend protected tenancy succession rights to same-sex couples. The House of Lords allowed that the appellant and his partner did constitute a family for legal purposes. The Lords decision agreed that there was not a spousal relationship (which they interpreted to mean a heterosexual marriage), nor were they \\"living together as a husband or wife\\" (which they interpreted as providing protection only for unmarried heterosexual couples), but stated that a long-term same-sex relationship could be considered a family even without the ties of blood or marriage. The decision was welcomed by gay rights campaigners including the campaign group Stonewall.  See also  * Braschi v. Stahl Associates Co.

It is a sequel to the 2014 film Velaiilla Pattadhari and has Dhanush, Amala Paul, Vivek, Hrishikesh, Saranya Ponvannan, and Samuthirakani reprising their roles, while Kajol plays an antagonistic role in her second Tamil film after 1997's Minsara Kanavu. Dhanush, besides acting, also co-produced with N. Ramasamy, and wrote the story and dialogues for the film. Its music was composed by Sean Roldan. It was released worldwide on 11 August 2017, after initially planning to release on Dhanush's birthday, July 28. Plot The film opens two years after the events of the first film, with Anitha Constructions Civil Engineer Raghuvaran (Dhanush) winning the Civil Engineer of the Year 2016 Award and is an executive member of his company now, along with a parking spot. His wife Dr. Shalini (Amala Paul) becomes an authoritative, nagging wife who controls him. She has resigned her job to take care of the household, after marriage. Raghuvaran is also dismissive about his wife getting another job. Raghuvaran efficiently completes construction projects assigned to him, with the help of about 200 unemployed young civil, mechanical and electrical engineers, who are his friends. Vasundhara (Kajol), a chairman of a big construction company in South India, Vasundhara Constructions, witness the announcement of Raghuvaran's victory at the Engineer of the Year 2016 Awards and finds out about him. She makes Raghuvaran a job offer, but he humbly refuses. Later, Raghuvaran's project team and Vasundhara's top team are invited at the same time to exhibit their models for a proposed private medical college and hospital building to a very rich and native trader. Vasundhara exhibits her project with heavy pride and ego, while Raghuvaran explains his project in a simple manner. The trader gives the project to Anitha Constructions. Raghuvaran provides some polite advice to Vasundhara outside the building. This offends her, and she begins to go after him, placing one obstacle after another. First, she uses her influence in the state cabinet to force the trader to give the project back to her. She then makes counter-bids to all of Anitha Construction's projects at a lower price, causing the company to lose their own projects. Raghuvaran learns of this and quits his own job just to save his first company. He is approached by the son of a Delhi-based construction mogul, with an idea of starting a new construction company with 50-50 shares. Raghuvaran agrees by putting his house under mortgage of five million Rs and starts \\"VIP\\" Constructions with the 200 unemployed engineers as the company's employees. They don't get to start projects for a month. Due to a word of mouth, they get an offer from Prakash (Saravana Subbiah), a greedy businessman who wants to build a theme park in a marshy land. Raghuvaran's gang gets excited, but the soil tests prove them wrong. So, they decline the project. Prakash bribes an executive member of Vasundhara Constructions and makes her start on the same project. Raghuvaran's team starts a protest, and a countrywide uproar causes the project to be stopped by the government. Prakash is caught up between various lawsuits filed across the country. This causes a bad name and a loss of projects to Vasundhara Constructions. To eliminate Raghuvaran, she targets his company. She anonymously buys the 50% shares held by Raghuvaran, when it is legally up for sale to create funds. Raghuvaran is fired from VIP Constructions by Vasundhara, causing the employees to quit their own jobs immediately. That night, Prakash sends goons to kill Raghuvaran, but Raghuvaran beats them all up. He thinks that Vasundhara had sent them and goes to her office room in her company's main headquarters building. Vasundahra is alone in the building, as she is currently thinking about the loyalty of all the employees of VIP Constructions towards Raghuvaran. Raghuvaran initially berates, then advises Vasundara, and starts to leave. Unfortunately, the office is flooded due to heavy downpour, and they are trapped in their floor. They then cooperate to find biscuits and wine in the top floor. Due to their conversation, Vasundhara understands her mistakes and becomes friends with Raghuvaran. The next morning, Raghuvaran brings Vasundhara to his home to introduce her to his family, while both come to a deal to no longer quarrel with each other, to be business partners, and run VIP Constructions together.

However, Wynn's records were not commercially successful, and he began working as a sideman in T-Bone Walker's band, mainly playing the baritone saxophone. By the late 1940s, Wynn had developed an innovative performance style, involving dancing, stomping, and playing the saxophone while laying on his back. One reviewer said: \\"He would kick, dance, shuffle, strut, go down on his knees, roll and literally provide his own mini-show on stage, all the while blowing wild solos on his sax. He was the first of the Los Angeles area sax players to perform these antics on stage...\\". Wynn himself said: \\"Jay McNeely was a little kid when he used to come in and watch me play at weekends. Two or three years later he was laying on his back and playing. He's a great musician but he got the clowning from me.\\" Although Wynn made further recordings as leader in the 1950s, for various labels including Mercury with a band that included saxophonist Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis and guitarist Charles \\"Chuck\\" Norris, they were not hits. He worked as a session musician on many blues, R&B;, soul and pop records made on independent labels in Los Angeles in the 1950s and 1960s. He toured with Etta James and Richard Berry, and also worked extensively as a member of Johnny Otis' revue band. Wynn died in Los Angeles in 1977, aged 69.

Serving in various high military positions in the northern provinces, he was tasked with the defence of the frontier against the Mongols. He was most famous for his proposal to retake the Ordos Loop for the Ming and extend the Great Wall of China over the region, which was met with initial enthusiasm from the Jiajing Emperor; however, opponents of the proposal brought upon a quick reversal which resulted in the downfall and execution of Zeng Xian and his principal supporter, the Senior Grand Secretary Xia Yan. Early life and career Zeng Xian was born into a military family in Jiangdu of Hangzhou, Jiangsu province in 1499. By the age of 30, he had passed the imperial examinations twice, first as a juren and later as a jinshi. His first official assignment was as magistrate of the town of Changle in Fujian province, after which he was posted to Liaodong as a censor and regional inspector in January 1534. During his duty here, a mutiny broke out in Liaoyang in April 1535, and Zeng Xian's rapid action in putting down the mutiny and executing the ringleaders earned him recognition as a military expert. He was promoted as the director of the Grand Court of Revision () later in the year, and moved up to the posts of left assistant censor-in-chief () and grand coordinator of Shandong in 1541. China of the 1540s was under the threat of Altan Khan's raids across the northern frontier. As grand coordinator of Shandong, Zeng Xian initiated defence works around the city of Linqing on the Grand Canal. The resulting wall was seven miles long, crossing two rivers, and had nine gates including three water gates, along with numerous towers along its length. It became such a spectacle that the wall and the city became popularly known as the Jade Girdle City () at the time. After this, he was made vice- censor-in-chief () in September 1543 and later grand coordinator of Shanxi, being posted on various passes of the Great Wall of China in that province. The Veritable Records of the Ming notes that as a result of Zeng Xian's long service on the border and his outstanding achievements, the nomads had not attacked Xuanfu, Datong, or Shanxi. In 1546, Zeng became the vice minister of war and the Supreme Commander of the Shaanxi Three Borders Defense Areas, namely Yulin, Ningxia, and Guyuan. Proposal to retake the Ordos Zeng Xian started his new role with marked energy. Barely a month after he became supreme commander, he had the \\"Embroidered-uniform Guard\\" arrest four of his subordinates for incompetence and demoted three others, then took control of their troops and resources. It was around this time that Altan Khan invaded Shaanxi via Yan'an and Qingyang. Zeng Xian responded by sending a separate force to attack the rear of the Mongols by a circuitous route, which resulted in a slaughter of the Mongol women, children, and the elderly that travelled with the invading army at Mount Maliang (). This compelled the invaders to retreat. After the invasion, Zeng Xian led counter-attacks and strengthened local defences, but soon felt that a permanent solution was needed to deal with the nomadic raids along the border. To that end, he identified the Ordos Loopa stretch of land that is technically part of the steppe, but south of the Yellow River and capable of irrigated agricultureas a corridor that the Chinese must retake. On 8 January 1547, he memorialized the throne with a detailed proposal of a military campaign into the Ordos Loop and fortification of the land after chasing the nomads out from there. The militarily-minded Jiajing Emperor initially liked the idea, and ordered the treasury to allocate the funds needed for the endeavour. The Senior Grand Secretary Xia Yan, effectively the head of government under the emperor, placed his confidence and support behind Zeng Xian's proposal such that he might secure his position in the imperial court and associate his name with \\"an accomplishment of the kind that is seen only rarely in history\\" (). However, legitimate concerns about the costs of the operation were raised, and personal political rivals of Zeng Xian and Xia Yan banded together to use these opposing views to plot their downfall. Yan Song, a rival grand secretary, arranged to have rumours spread in the capital that Zeng Xian had been misappropriating funds to bribe influential officials to support his proposal. On 15 February 1548, the Jiajing Emperor suddenly voiced his misgivings about Zeng Xian's proposal and his character. Xia Yan was shocked at the reversal and immediately dropped his sponsorship of the project in order to limit his association with Zeng Xian. The emperor called for an re-examination of the whole issue, during which he dismissed Zeng Xian's integrity and called the proposal ill-considered. The campaign was cancelled, and Zeng Xian was arrested. Because of the scandal, Zeng Xian's name became so toxic that Xia Yan was compelled to ask for retirement. For a time, the emperor allowed Xia to retire without reducing his ranks, but Xia's enemies harped on connections of Zeng Xian's crimes to Xia Yan. As a result of these charges, Zeng Xian was executed on 25 April 1548, and Xia Yan too was beheaded on 31 October 1548. Yan Song became the head of the grand secretariat and controlled the imperial court for more than a decade since. The people of the time considered the punishment to be too harsh for the perceived crime, and in 1567, early in the reign of the Longqing Emperor, a motion was filed to review Zeng Xian's case. Thereupon the imperial court granted Zeng the posthumous name of Xiangmin () and the rank of minister of war.

It is first recorded in a document from Lorsch Abbey dating to 780. History The lords of Ortenburg (descended from the Lords of B√ºdingen) built a castle in Gedern. In 1247, after the death of Gerlach II, Bailiff of B√ºdingen, Gedern fell to Eberhard I of Breuberg from the House of Reis von Beuberg and Albert I of Trimberg, who had married Gerlach's daughter. Eberhard I of Breuberg was followed by his son Gerlach and that Gerlach's son Eberhard III, both bailiffs of Wetterau. In 1323, Eberhard III died without leaving a surviving son and so the Lordship of Gedern passed to Conrad V of Trimberg and Gottfried V of Eppstein. In 1356, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor granted the House of Trimberg market rights in Gedern. When they died in 1376/84 in Mannesstam, Gedern passed entirely to the House of Eppstein. After the House of Eppstein divided up its lands in 1433, Gedern passed to the Eppstein-K√∂nigstein line. The last of that line, Eberhard IV, had no male issue and so it passed to the house of Stolberg, to which his wife Anna and his nephew Louis of Stolberg belonged. Louis grew up with Eberhard and Anna from 1514 onwards and became Eberhard's heir. Stolberg-Gedern On Eberhard IV's death in 1535, Gedern and its associated County of K√∂nigstein passed to the Counts of Stolberg. Louis took them both over and founded the short-lived County of Stolberg- K√∂nigstein. After the male line went extinct, it passed to the Stolberg- Wernigerode line. In 1677, the house of Stolberg-Gedern was created by the division of the lands of the house of Stolberg-Wernigerode. The second count of Stolberg-Gedern, Frederick Charles, bought promotion to the status of an imperial prince from Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor on 18 February 1742. The Princes of Stolberg-Gedern became extinct in the male line in 1804 and so the lordship of Gedern was passed back to the main Stolberg-Wernigerode line. However, with the adoption of the sovereignty rights outlined in the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine, that line had to cede it to Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1816, Gedern and the Stolberg-Wernigerode line also briefly fell under Isenburg. In 1945, the area became part of Gro√ühessen, then the following year part of Hesse.

It is believed that the Mannan community were the warrior tribe of Pandyan lines, fled to the forest interiors of Idukki at time of the prolonged war between Cheras and Cholas in ancient Tamilakam. Today, they hosts an annual festival named 'Kalavoottu' as a tribute to the nature for providing sufficient harvest. An 'Aadivasi Koothu' is also conducted with the Kalavoottu festival which is primarily associated with the Kovalan-Kannagi story, mentioned in the famous Tamil literary work 'Silappatikaram'. It is also organized during the death ceremonies of kings and at times of official annual meetings.

House of Eppstein On 6 August 1505 Maximilian I granted the titles of lords of K√∂nigstein, Eppstein and Munzenberg to the brothers Eberhard, George and Philip, all from the house of Eppstein. However, all three of them remained without male issue and so their sister Anna's son was made heir to all three of them - Anna had married Botho of Stolbeg. After the imperial register of 1521, the counts of K√∂nigstein were to provide four cavalrymen and thirteen foot soldiers in case of war. House of Stolberg After Eberhard IV of Eppstein died on 25 May 1535, the county was inherited by his heir Louis of Stolberg, who had served as co-ruler with his uncle Eberhard as early as 1527. He introduced the Protestant Reformation to the county, reorganizing the church along the same lines as Wolfgang, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken, although Marienschloss Abbey successfully held out against it. Louis died without male issue and so his brother Christoph of Stolberg inherited the county but he was its last lord, dying on 5 August 1581. After this Daniel Brendel von Homburg, Elector of Mainz, stated that his brother Albrecht Georg of Stolberg was considered the county as his fiefdom, as a proxy of Rudolf II and that Mainz should act as imperial commissary for the lordship of K√∂nigstein. This promoted K√∂nigstein into an 'oberamt'. The counts of Stolberg complained to the Reichskammergericht over the issue and although it ceased to be a separately- ruled entity, it nominally existed until 1806 and the Act of Confederation, which abolished it and assigned it and Gedern to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.

Such buildings provided a valuable source of fresh meat and eggs, adding variety to meals in the winter months. The large amounts of droppings, which built up on the doocot's floors, made a valuable general fertiliser and was also used in the production of gunpowder and in such processes as the dyeing of linen and in tanning leather.Dovecotes in Scotland Windmills were often built in areas of low rainfall or where the land was flat and the water current sluggish however in this coastal location the advantage was the expectation of strong winds at all times of the year. The 1775 Armstrong map clearly shows a working windmill at Monkton with four sails.Armstrong, Andrew, 1700-1794 Workings details This type of windmill is described as \\"...a fixed tower surmounted by a movable cap which supported the sails. The windcap was turned into the wind by hand. The structure, built of local materials, often stone rubble, stood on an artificial mound over a stone-built vaulted chamber or cellar. The latter often extended outwards from the base of the mill and provided a third floor, which acted as a receiving and dispatching room.\\" Scottish Windmills - An Ootline and Inventory by Ian L.

It is endemic to Sarawak, Borneo. Common names Murud black slender toad and widow slender toad have been coined for this little known species. The latter name refers to the black colouration of this species and the fact that no male individuals are known. Etymology The specific name vidua is Latin for \\"widow\\" and refers to the uniform brownish-black colouration of this species, much like what widows have traditionally chosen. It also refers to the fact that males of this species are unknown. Distribution Ansonia echinata is endemic to Malaysian Borneo where it is only known from its type locality, Gunung Murud (=Mount Murud) in the Pulong Tau National Park, Sarawak. Description The type series consists of two adult females that measured in snout‚Äìvent length. No other specimens are known. The habitus is slender. The colouration is uniformly black-brown above; the limbs are dark brown with lighter areas on joints of the limbs and phalanges. The iris is black with small, intense red spots. The dorsum, flanks, and upper surfaces of the limbs are covered with many small, low, rounded warts that give the skin a velvet-like appearance. The warts on the dorsum, head, and limbs terminate in a single fine, keratinous spine. The tympanum is distinct and slightly greater than half eye in diameter. There are two low, longitudinal interorbital ridges. The canthus rostralis is slightly swollen. The webbing between the toes is reduced. The fingers and toes are long. Male Ansonia vidua are unknown. Hertwig and colleagues discuss the possibility that Ansonia echinata, known only from male specimens (and one unsexed juvenile), could be conspecific with Ansonia vidua. Based on morphological and ecological differences, they conclude that the two are separate species, although lack of tissue samples from A. echinata means that this question could not be settled with molecular methods. Also the tadpoles are unknown. Habitat and ecology Both known specimens were found at night, just below the summit ridge of the Gunung Murud massif at above sea level. They were resting on the leaves of lower vegetation a few meters from a small stream in undisturbed, mossy montane forest. Other aspects of its ecology are unknown.

Published in 1725 The Golconda Diamonds are Indian diamonds mined in a specific geographic area in the present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states of India. During the rule of the historic Qutb Shahi dynasty (16th century‚Äì17th century CE), also known as the \\"Golconda Sultanate\\", diamonds from these mines (especially Kollur Mine in Andhra Pradesh) were transported to the city of Hyderabad to be cut, polished, evaluated and sold. Golconda in Hyderabad established itself as a diamond trading centre and, until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and one of the largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name 'Golconda Diamond' became synonymous with Golconda itself. The Golconda region has produced some of the world's most famous diamonds, including the colourless Koh-i-Noor (now owned by the United Kingdom), the blue Hope (United States), the pink Daria-i-Noor (Iran), the white Regent (France), the Dresden Green (Germany), and the colourless Orlov (Russia), Nizam and Jacob (India), as well as the now lost diamonds Florentine Yellow, Akbar Shah and Great Mogul. One of the most popular diamond mines was Kollur Mine (presently in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh). There were also other mines around the River Krishna in South India. Along with diamonds, the region also became a trade centre for metal-ware, pearls, spices and textiles. According to The New Indian Express (22 October 2016), \\"the Hyderabad based historian, Muhammad Safiullah says such was the trade that the estimated output from all mines in Golconda was estimated to be around 12 million carats\\". History Golconda sultanate was located in between the two major sea ports of India, Surat and Machilipatnam. The town was developed as a trade centre and, under the patronage of the Qutb Shahi rulers, a thriving market particularly of diamonds was developed nearby the Golconda fort, the work force involved in the diamond trading was up to 100,000 people. The medieval diamond trade drew travellers from around the world and the ruling patrons constructed facilities and provided security for traders to stay and do business, particularly those travelling from Europe and central Asia. According to Manu S. Pillai, (The Hindu, 5 November 2016), Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, renowned French traveller and jeweller, claimed to have seen a flat diamond called the Great Table diamond kept in a dungeon in Golconda. Jean de Th√©venot and Fran√ßois Bernier were also French traders in 'Golconda Diamonds'.

It is now used as Rockenburg Prison. History It may have been preceded on the site by a hermitage dedicated to nursing. The nunnery was founded on 30 April 1338 Sir Johann von Bellersheim and his wife Gertrude, called Gezele von D√ºdelsheim. Its monastery church was consecrated to St Mary and St John the Baptist on 1 November 1339 and in 1342 pope Innocent VI incorporated the monastery into the Cistercian order and made it subordinate to Arnsburg Abbey. During the 14th and 15th century it was assigned lands. Monastic discipline declined under abbess Lucia and so in 1466 bishop Adolph II of Nassau replaced almost all the nuns and installed a new abbess. In 1535 the Protestant Reformation was introduced to Rockenberg - the monastery remained Catholic but the abbess was patron to the town's parish church and appointed tolerant Protestant pastors. In 1544 the Diet of Speyer assigned the nunnery to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and in 1581 it passed to the Electorate of Mainz. Oppershofen and Rockenberg became Catholic again in 1602-1603 due to the Counter Reformation and the abbey undertook major rebuilds from 1606 to 1619. However, it was badly looted several times soon afterwards during the Thirty Years' War and many monastery buildings were partially destroyed. These were initially repaired after the war - the vicar general Volusius reported after a visitation in 1678 that the nunnery was \\"the poorest [of them], but the nuns were the most obedient\\". It only fully revived in the 18th century with restorations under abbesses Christiane Strebin (holding office 1678 -1724), Franziska Koch (1724-1736) and Antonia Hartz (1736-1774), gradually replacing or redesigning buildings in the Baroque style and extending the cloister. Though the abbey's financial conditions remained modest, a new abbey was completed in 1733, a new provost's house in 1744 and a new Rococo abbey church between 1746 and 1749, though the church's interior was only completed with installation of the new high altar in 1778. The projects led the abbey into major debt and the war years of 1743, 1757 and especially 1792 led the abbey further into decline. It was occupied by French troops in October 1792 and two years later some of its buildings served as an \\"imperial hospital\\". It was finally taken over by Louis I, Grand Duke of Hesse, who forbade religious vows and the admission of novices. It was officially passed to Hesse-Darmstadt in 1803 by the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss. The few remaining nuns moved to live with their relatives or to a house next door to Rockenberg's parish church in 1808 before the abbey was dissolved the following year and converted into a borstal and then in 1811 into a prison. It was then converted into a prison for male teenagers in 1939 before ownership passed to the State of Hesse in 1946.

Oxamate has a molecular formula of C2H2NO3‚àí an isosteric form of pyruvate. Oxamate is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Oxamate is a possible pyruvate analog that has the ability to halt lactate production by inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase, effectively stopping the conversation process of pyruvate to lactate. Oxamate [lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor] plus Phenformin (phenethylbiguanide; an anti-diabetic agent) has been tested in conjunction with one another and it was shown that this combination has potential anti-cancer properties. Phenformin when administered by itself has a high incidence of lactic acidosis. Due to the inherent ability of Oxamate to prevent the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, oxamate can be used to counter balance the side effects of Phenformin. Oxamate also plays inhibiting roles with Oxaloacetate, an important intermediate for the Citric acid cycle. Oxamate competes and binds to the Carboxyl transferase domain active site, and reverses the reaction of oxalaoacetate decarboxylation by Pyruvate carboxylase.

It featured four icons of Communist thought, namely Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Ch√© Guevara and Mao Zedong being asked quiz questions. The sketch A quiz show named \\"World Forum\\" is hosted by Eric Idle. He introduces his four guests, Karl Marx (played by Terry Jones), Vladimir Lenin (played by Eden Fox), Che Guevara (played by Terry Gilliam) and Mao Zedong (played by Basil Tang). Despite announcing this event as a \\"unique occasion in the history of television\\" the host then simply starts asking these historical figures trivial quiz questions. Marx is asked which English football team is nicknamed \\"The Hammers\\". He has obviously no idea (in reality it's West Ham United F.C.). Idle then asks Guevara a different question, namely in which year Coventry City FC last won the FA Cup? When Guevara also fails to give any answer at all Idle throws the question open to the other guests, but still receives no answer from any of then. Idle then says: \\"Well, I'm not surprised you didn't get that. It was in fact a trick question: Coventry City have never won the FA Cup.\\" With the scores all equal the second quiz round begins. Idle asks Lenin the name of the song by Teddy Johnson and Pearl Carr which won the 1959's Eurovision Song Contest. Lenin has no clue, so Idle once again throws the question open. Unexpectedly Mao rings his buzzer and gives the correct answer: \\"Sing Little Birdie\\" (The song actually finished second.). Idle then takes Marx to the special gift section of the quiz. He is able to win a beautiful lounge suite if he is able to answer all questions correctly. The host announces that Marx has chosen questions on the workers control of factories as his special subject. He asks Marx by what other development the industrial proletariat is conditioned, to which Marx correctly answers: \\"The development of the industrial bourgeoisie\\". Idle continues asking what kind of struggle the struggle of class against class is, to which Marx again correctly replies: \\"A political struggle\\". The final question however turns out to be another sports question, when Marx is asked who won the 1949 FA Cup Final? As Marx desperately tries to reply unrelated things like \\"the worker's control of the means of production\\" and \\"the struggle of the urban proletariat\\" the host informs him that he lost and that the correct answer was in fact the Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. who beat Leicester City F.C., 3-1. The broadcast closes with stock footage of a crowd cheering over a winning goal during an association football match. A caption announces that \\"next week\\" the four leading heads of state of the Afro-Asian Nations will be playing against Bristol Rovers at Molineux. Notes about the sketch Despite what the host says, the winning song of the 1959 Eurovision Song Contest was not \\"Sing Little Birdie\\", but Dutch singer Teddy Scholten's \\"Een Beetje\\". On 16 May 1987, 17 years after this sketch was first broadcast, Coventry City F.C. did in fact win the 1987 FA Cup Final.Ross, Robert, Monty Python Encyclopedia, 1999, TV Books, The questions asked of Marx in the special gift section of the quiz are all references to his book Communist Manifesto. Later in the same Flying Circus episode, in which a sketch about the First Battle of Ypres is having difficulty getting started, the camera cuts to a quick shot of Marx and Guevara on the World Forum set, who are now kissing and embracing each other. At the end of the episode after the final credits roll, Marx & Guevara are seen in bed together. In other media An audio version of the sketch can be heard on the extended US version of Another Monty Python Record (1971), with live recordings released on Monty Python Live at Drury Lane (1974) and Monty Python Live at City Center (1976). The sketch was also featured in the 1982 concert film Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl, where Eric Idle reprised his role as the quiz host and Terry Jones as Marx. The other roles were portrayed by different actors, though. John Cleese took on the role of Lenin, Michael Palin played Guevara and Terry Gilliam in yellowface acted as Mao. While the sketch mostly follows the same pattern as in the TV broadcast there are some notable differences. Idle's final question to the four guests is the name of Jerry Lee Lewis' biggest hit, to which Mao correctly answers \\"Great Balls of Fire\\", albeit in an Engrish accent. When Idle shows Marx the lounge suite he might win he adds that it is a \\"beautiful non-materialistic lounge suite.\\" While Marx didn't say anything after losing in the TV sketch he does react to his loss here, by using the strong language: \\"Oh, shit!\\" Idle also pushes him away with the aggressive order: \\"Get out of here!\\", then says: \\"Well, no one leaves this show empty-handed, so we're gonna cut off his hands.\\" The original TV sketch was added to the compilation video Parrot Sketch Not Included - 20 Years of Monty Python (1989) and Monty Python's Flying Circus: Michael Palin's Personal Best.

Kraus & Naimer is a supplier of switchgear for industrial customers in the fields of transport (railways, vehicles, ships, etc.), conveyor systems, lift systems, mechanical engineering and power generation and power distribution systems. The parent house of the Austrian family business Kraus & Naimer is located in Vienna, Austria. It is currently active with six factories in Europe (Germany, Austria, Hungary), North ‚Äì and South America (USA, Brazil) and Oceania (New Zealand) and 18 worldwide company owned sales ‚Äì and customer consultation subsidiaries. It holds 10 of those subsidiaries in Europe (Austria, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Finland, Sweden, UK, Norway, Netherlands), two in North America (USA, Canada), two in Oceania (Australia, New Zealand), one in South America (Brazil), one in Africa (South Africa) and two in Asia (Japan, Singapore). It employs globally around 900 employees worldwide, who produce almost 163 million revenue annually. Kraus & Naimer is specialized in the field of switchgear in the course of its history and supplies its products to leading industrial companies worldwide.  History  Production site in Weikersdorf am Steinfelde, Lower Austria The company was founded in Vienna in 1907 in Wattgasse 53 within the 16th district Ottakring. The company's history began in the era of emerging electricity. Lorenz Naimer, founder and financier of the company as well as his partner Franz Kraus, who was responsible for the technical development and implementation, researched in the field of electrical special machines. On 28 September 1909, the company was officially renamed Kraus & Naimer. In 1912, the company relocated to Schumanngasse 35 in the 18th district W√§hring, which was extended in the years 1947‚Äì1961. Between 1968 and 1970 an additional production facility was built close to Vienna in Weikersdorf in Lower Austria. This was supplemented by an assembly plant from 1989 ‚Äì 1990 and expanded to almost double the size in 2013. In 1947, Hubert Laurenz Naimer took over the management of the company from his father Lorenz Naimer, which he developed into a global corporation through innovations and global business drive until his death in 2004. In 1981, his son Joachim Laurenz Naimer joined the management of the company, and has led the family enterprise since 2004.  Products  The foundation stone of the company was laid in Vienna in 1907 in the Wattgasse 53 in the 16th district Ottakring. The company initially produced knife switches, the forerunners of today's disconnectors, which are counted from construction to the simplest and the first electrical switches towards the end of the 19th century. The other main products in the first four decades of the company's existence were lever and roller switches. At the end of the 1920s the new plastic material bakelite was used in switch construction. Kraus & Naimer is the patent owner of numerous innovations in switchgear technology. For the first time, the company introduced a cam switch in the modular design (model C15) to the market in 1948, whereby customer-specific switches can be manufactured. The method of mass production of individual products is generally known in the industry also under the term mass customization. Another milestone in the company's history was the development of the world smallest cam switch (model CA4N), which has been available since 1994. At the beginning of the 50s, Kraus & Naimer was one of the first industrial companies to use thermoplastics, especially polyamides, in the switchgear technology. The entire value-added chain from research and development to sales is handled by the company itself with specially founded logistics and dispatch centers as well as worldwide dispatch cooperation partners. As one of the world's leading manufacturers of rotary cam switches which uses a small amount of gold and tin, Kraus & Naimer took necessary steps to avoid the use of materials from illegal and unethical sources in their products and purchase their raw materials from companies that are listed on the CFSI Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative CFSI.

He was a leading authority on the oracle bone and turtle shell inscriptions of the Shang dynasty (1600-1046 BC). In 1928, Dong supervised the first archaeological dig of Anyang, the Shang capital. Dong was a professor at National Taiwan University and director of the institute of philology and history at Academia Sinica from 1950 to 1954. Dong's construction of a Shang chronology was his most important research achievement.Boorman, Harvard L., editor, Biographical Dictionary of the Republic of China, \\"Tung Tso-pin\\", Columbia University Press, New York, 1967. III:345-347. Early life Dong was born 20 March 1895 to a shopkeeper's family in Nanyang in southern Henan Province. His talent for calligraphy and writing were already noticed when he was a child. As a result, he was employed by a local seal engraver when he was about 11 or 12. As his father needed help in the shop, Dong could not begin formal education until 1915. In 1922, Dong went to Beijing to audit classes at Peking University and enrolled the following year. Career Dong became a professor at National Zhongshan University in Guangzhou in 1927. He visited Anyang in the summer of 1928 and found that villagers were still digging up oracle bones and shells and selling them, as they had been since around 1895. Although many scholars assumed that thirty years of looting had already removed all valuable items, Dong's visit led him to suggest an archaeological dig. His university approved the dig and he supervised fieldwork in October 1928. This was the first systematic dig of the Anyang site. Some 784 items were uncovered. There was a total of fifteen expeditions to Anyang before work was interrupted by the Sino-Japanese War. These expeditions were directed by Li Ji, and Dong participated in most of them. The most spectacular discovery, made in June 1937, was Pit H127. This underground chamber housed the archives of two Shang kings. Three tons of finds were removed from this pit.Higham, Charles, Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations, Infobase Publishing, May 14, 2014, \\"Dong Zuobin\\", p. 96. In March 1932, Dong's breakthrough work, Jiaguwen duandai yanjiu li, was published. The work gave ten criteria for dating an inscription within the Shang dynasty. It also gave the genealogy of the Shang kings, terms of address used in the inscriptions, names of foreign countries used, grammatical constructions, and ideographic constructions. Publication of the inscriptions themselves was delayed due to wartime conditions and the arduous process of preparation. Dong finally able to published this important work in Hong Kong in 1941 as Yinxu wenzi, jia pian [Texts from Yinxu, first collection]. Dong accepted an invitation to lecture on oracle bone inscriptions in the United States in January 1947. He lectured at both University of Chicago and at Yale. He returned to China in late 1948 and immediately began work on evacuating his department to Taiwan. Among Dong's achievements was his division of the evolution of the oracle bone script into five stages. He also correlated various Shang calendars with lunar eclipses. His research also led to a chronological identification of the twelve kings who ruled Anyang for 273 years beginning 14 January 1384 BC.In 2000, the Xia‚ÄìShang‚ÄìZhou Chronology Project produced a chronology that begins with Wu Ding, whose accession is dated as 1250 BC. Dong gives 1339 BC. He also worked out the dates of individual reigns and the rounds of ancestral sacrifice. Dong died in Taiwan on 23 November 1963.

The building corners and entrances have wide trim borders, and the gable above is fully pedimented, with a triangular fan at its center. The interior contains a single large chamber, with a stage at the far end, and a small kitchen in a rear ell. with The town of Woodbury was settled in 1781, and held its first recorded town meeting in 1806. Its early town meetings were held in a district school near the town center. This town hall was built in 1842 after the town's growing population prompted the need for a larger civic meeting space.

The film follows two American soldiers (Aaron Taylor-Johnson and John Cena) trapped by an Iraqi sniper. Produced by Amazon Studios, it was released on May 12, 2017 by Roadside Attractions. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $4.5 million against a $3 million budget.  Plot  At the close of the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews (John Cena) is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by famed Iraqi sniper nicknamed ‚ÄúJuba.‚ÄùIsaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him. Isaac hears the rescue helicopters coming, so he pushes down the wall and uses Matthews' rifle to try and kill Juba, or at least flush him out so the rescue chopper can see the trap. Juba fires at Isaac twice and misses. Isaac now has the sniper's location and fires his only round. Isaac stands up and waits for Juba's next shot, but it never comes. The helicopters land and the rescue team picks up Isaac and Matthews. Once the helicopters dust off, the sniper successfully shoots down both in rapid succession. He is then heard over the radio, calling for another rescue to set a new trap.  Cast  * Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Sergeant Allen \\"Ize\\" Isaac * John Cena as Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews * Laith Nakli as Juba (voice)  Production  On November 12, 2014, it was announced that Amazon Studios had bought its first ever original spec script by Dwain Worrell, about an American sharpshooter trapped behind a wall by an Iraqi sniper. Worrell wrote his screenplay while teaching English in China. Worrell drew from his background as a playwright to flesh out the second act of the screenplay, which focuses on Isaac's conversation with the sniper. Worrell said, \\"What interested me about it was the simple conversation between two people. That could almost be had on a New York City park bench with two guys playing chess. There is that sort of dynamic between the characters in the film.\\" The script appeared in the 2014 Black List of most liked un-produced screenplays. On March 29, 2016, it was reported that Doug Liman had been hired to direct the psychological thriller. Glen Basner's FilmNation Entertainment handled the film's international sales at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, allowing for a theatrical release. On May 9, 2016, Variety confirmed that Aaron Taylor- Johnson had joined the film's cast to play Isaac, the junior American soldier. On November 29, it was reported that Amazon had partnered with Roadside Attractions to distribute the film, which would also star John Cena, and the film would now follow two American soldiers. Amazon produced the film along with Big Indie Pictures, and Picrow, and Dave Bartis. Principal photography on the film ended in November 2016 with a release of first look image. US Ranger Sniper Nicholas Irving \\"The Reaper\\" was an on-set adviser for the film. Director Doug Liman reveals on the DVD commentary that the original ending of the film was a happy ending with the successful rescue of Sgt. Isaac. After the first public showing, Liman went back to Amazon Studios for additional money to reshoot the ending.  Release  The Wall was scheduled to be released on March 10, 2017, by Roadside Attractions but was pushed back to May 12, 2017. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65% based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 6.04/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Wall makes the most of its limitations -- albeit perhaps not quite enough to stretch its tight-focused action into a consistently gripping feature-length thriller.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score 57 out of 100, based 26 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

Life  Born into an old noble Breton family near Morlaix, his ancestors included several army and navy officers. His father was Nicolas Boudin de Tromelin, lord of Tromelin (1727-1790), and his mother Genevi√®ve du Buisson de Vieux Ch√¢tel. After studying at the √âcole militaire de Vend√¥me and graduating in 1787, he entered the r√©giment de Limousin in 1788. It was then garrisoning Corsica. At the start of the French Revolution he and his family emigrated. Jacques joined the Arm√©e des Princes in 1792, fighting in all the campaigns on the Rhine and in western France as well as the Quiberon Expedition of 1795. He managed to escape the executions after the expedition's failure and returned to London, living modestly and taking drawing lessons. Missing France, he convinced William Sidney Smith to take him on board HMS Diamond. Lenotre described the episode: All √©migr√©s captured on French soil were condemned to death, so de Tromelin tried to pass as John Bromley, a Canadian servant of Smith's. he was sent back to Britain, where he organized Smith's escape. He was personally made a knight of the order of saint Louis on his return to France. He then joined the Arm√©e catholique et royale de Normandie and was captured again in Caen in 1798, but managed to flee east. He served in Egypt and Syria as a major in the Ottoman sultan's forces against the French invasion of Egypt. He returned to France in 1802 and was imprisoned at the Abbaye Prison. As a result of the plot by Pichegru, Cadoudal and Meh√©e de la Touche, he left prison after six months, was struck from the list of √©migr√©s and made a captain in the 112th Line Infantry Regiment. Put in command of a battalion in 1809 during the Dalmatian Campaign, he became a colonel after the battle of Wagram, in command of the 6th Croatian Regiment. In 1813 he became adjutant general to the Arm√©e d'Allemagne. Promoted to brigadier general and count of the Empire after the battle of Leipzig, he headed the Brigade Tromelin during the Hundred Days - this formed part of the 6th Infantry Corps of the Arm√©e du Nord. He fought at the battle of Waterloo, commanding the last French brigade to leave the field of battle, and the provisional government tasked him with requesting passports for Napoleon from Wellington. He also contributed to the cessation of hostilities in Paris before taking part in the 1823 Spanish expedition, fighting at Igualada, Caiders, Yorba and Tarragona and gaining the rank of lieutenant general. In 1828 he published Observations sur les routes qui conduisent du Danube √† Constantinople √† travers le Balcan ou mont Hoemus, suivies de quelques r√©flexions sur la n√©cessit√© de l'intervention des puissances du midi de l'Europe dans les affaires de la Gr√®ce, par le lieutenant-g√©n√©ral comte de T.

In a three-year track career he won twelve of his twenty races including seven Grade 1 events, won four JRA Awards and set the record for prize money won in Japan. He was a stayer who has produced most of his best performances over distances of 2400 metres or further. Unraced as a juvenile in 2014 he proved himself one of the best colts of his generation in Japan in the following year with wins in the Spring Stakes, St Lite Kinen and Kikuka Sho as well as third-place finishes in the Satsuki Sho and the Arima Kinen. He continued his good form in the first half of 2016 with a win in the spring edition of the Tenno Sho and a close third in the Takarazuka Kinen. He returned to the track in autumn to win the Kyoto Daishoten and the Japan Cup. His performances in 2016 saw him being voted Japanese Horse of the Year. In the following year he added four more G1 wins and was again named Horse of the Year. Background Kitasan Black is a bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred in Japan by the Hokkaido-based Yanagawa Bokujo. During his track career he has been owned by , a company owned by the popular singer Saburo Kitajima. He has been trained for all of his races by Hisashi Shimizu. Kitasan Black is a large Thoroughbred who has weighed up to 540 kg in his racing career. Kitasan Black is from the third crop of foals sired by Black Tide, who was a full-brother to Deep Impact. Black Tide was a high-class performer in his own right, winning the Spring Stakes in 2004 before his career was severely disrupted by an injury sustained in the Satsuki Sho. His dam Sugar Heart was an unraced daughter of the Japanese Champion Sprinter Sakura Bakushin O. Her dam Otome Gokoro was a half- sister to Cee's Tizzy, the sire of Tiznow. Racing career =2015: three- year-old season= Kitasan Black began his track career in a contest for unraced three-year-olds over 1800 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 31 January 2015 and won by a length from Mikki Joy and fourteen others. Three weeks later he followed up with a victory in a minor race over 2000 metres at the same track beating Tosen Rasen by about three lengths. The colt was then stepped up to Grade II level for the Spring Stakes (a trial for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 22 March. He started at odds of 11.3/1 against eleven opponents including Danon Platina, who had been named Japanese champion two-year-old colt after winning the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes and Real Steel who had defeated Duramente in the Grade III Tokinominoru Kinen. Ridden as in most of his races that year by Hiroshi Kitamura he won by a neck from Real Steel, with Danon Platina three quarters of a length back in third place. In the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at the same track on 19 April he started the 8.7/1 fourth choice in the fifteen runner field and finished third behind Duramente and Real Steel with the favoured Satono Crown (winner of the Yayoi Sho) in sixth place. Following the race his trainer Hisashi Shimizu explained \\"our horse gave it everything he had and I thought he turned in a good performance. He doesn‚Äôt give in easily\\". On 31 May at Tokyo Racecourse the colt contested the 82nd running of the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres but after racing in second place he dropped away quickly in the last 300 metres and finished fourteenth of the eighteen runners behind Duramente. Kyoto Racecourse, where Kitasan Black won the Kikuka Sho After a break of almost four months, Kitasan Black returned on 21 September for the Grade II St Lite Kinen (a trial race for the Kikuka Sho) over 2200 metres. He started at odds of 11.5/1 in a field headed by Satono Rasen who had finished second in the Tokyo Yushun, with the other fancied contenders including the Grade III winners Bright Emblem and Beruf. In a closely contested finish, he won by three quarters of a length and a head from the outsiders Musee Alien and Jun Tsubasa. On 25 October Kitasan Black was partnered by Kitamura when he started at odds of 12.4/1 in an eighteen-runner field for the Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse. The favourite was Lia Fail, the winner of the Grade II Kobe Shimbun Hai, whilst the other runners included Real Steel, Satono Rasen, Beruf, Bright Emblem, Musee Alien and Jun Tsubasa. After racing in fifth place on the inside, Kitasan Black took the lead early in the straight and held off the late challenge of Real Steel by a neck with Lia Fail half a length back in third. After the race Shimizu, who was recording his first Grade I win as a trainer, commented \\"There were concerns over his aptitude for long distances but I wanted to prove that this was wrong, as his form and movements showed that he is suited to long distances. There were horses chasing us on the outside after we took command so I just hoped that he will hold on until the wire.\\" Owner Saburo Kitajima celebrated by serenading the crowd with a rendition of his hit song \\"Matsurida (It's Festival Time)\\". On his final appearance of 2015 Kitasan Black was matched against older opponents for the first time when he was one of sixteen horses invited by public vote to contest the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 27 December. Ridden by Norihiro Yokoyama he finished third behind the four-year- olds Gold Actor and Sounds of Earth, beaten a length by the winner with Gold Ship, Lovely Day, Marialite and One and Only (2014 Tokyo Yushun) among the beaten runners. =2016: four-year-old season= Kitasan Black's owner Saburo Kitajima In 2016 the veteran Yutaka Take took over as Kitasan Black's regular jockey. The colt began his four-year-old campaign in a strong renewal of the Grade II Osaka Hai over 2000 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 3 April. He led from the start and looked likely to win before being caught in the final strides and beaten a neck into second place by Ambitious (who was carrying 2 kg less) with the next four places being filled by Shonan Pandora, Lovely Day, Isla Bonita (2014 Satsuki Sho) and Nuovo Record (Yushun Himba). On 1 May Kitasan Black moved back up in distance for the spring edition of the Grade I Tenno Sho over 3200 metres at Kyoto and started second favourite behind Gold Actor. The other sixteen runners included Cheval Grand (Hanshin Daishoten), Fame Game (runner-up in the 2015 race), Albert (Stayers Stakes), Sounds of Earth and Toho Jackal (2014 Kikuka Sho). Kitasan Black disputed the lead from the start and held on to win by a nose from the 98/1 outsider Curren Mirotic after a \\"nail-biting duel\\" over the last 150 metres. Take, who was winning the race for the seventh time said \\"I was intending to settle him in a good position after the start. He ran an ideal race, he responded beautifully. He's not the type with an enormous burst of speed, so we made an early bid. It was so close but I‚Äôm glad he never gave up and stretched the way he did\\". On his next start the colt was then one of seventeen horses invited to contest the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin on 26 June. In another close finish he took third place, beaten a neck and a nose by Marialite and the odds-on favourite Duramente after leading until the final strides. On 10 October Kitasan Black returned from a three and a half month absence for the Grade II Kyoto Daishoten and started 4/5 favourite against eight opponents headed by Lovely Day and Sounds of Earth. After racing in second place he took the lead in the straight and won the race by a neck from the outsider Admire Deus with Lovely Day and Sounds of Earth in third and fourth. The 36th running of the Japan Cup over 2400 metres at Tokyo on 27 November attracted a field of seventeen runners and Kitasan Black was made the 2.8/1 favourite. Before the race Take said \\"I‚Äôm not cooking up any special strategies... I‚Äôm going to do my best to answer the fans‚Äô expectations as a representative of Japan\\". The overseas contingent comprised Nightflower (Preis von Europa) and Iquitos (Grosser Preis von Baden) from Germany and Erupt (Grand Prix de Paris, Canadian International Stakes) from France. The leading Japanese contenders included Real Steel (who had won the Dubai Turf in March), Gold Actor, Dee Majesty (Satsuki Sho), Sounds of Earth, Cheval Grand and the filly Rouge Buck. Kitasan Black led from the start, established a clear lead entering the straight and stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths from Sounds of Earth. Take, who was winning the race for a record fourth time described the winner as \\"perhaps the strongest [horse] I've ever experienced\\". Shimizu indicated that the horse would end his season in the Arima Kinen before being campaigned internationally in 2017 saying \\"He did everything we asked him to do in the workouts so I was confident of his form. The jockey unleashed him at just the right time. You can‚Äôt help but consider Dubai and the Arc as they are natural fits for him\\". For his final run of the year, Kitasan Black was again aimed at the Arima Kinen and in the poll to determine the final line up, he topped the voting with over 130,000 votes. In the race he was ridden by Lemaire and started the 2.7/1 second choice in the betting behind the three-year-old Satono Diamond in a field of sixteen. Breaking quickly from an inside draw, Kitasan Black settled in second place behind the outsider Maltese Apogee before moving into the lead entering the straight. He turned back a sustained challenge from Gold Actor but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by Satono Diamond. =2017: five-year- old season= Yutaka Take, who rode Kitasan Black in 2016 and 2017 On 2 April, Kitasan Black began his five-year-old campaign in the Osaka Hai, which had been elevated to Grade I level for the first time and started the 2.4/1 favourite against thirteen opponents headed by Makahiki and Satono Crown. After racing in third place he moved into the lead in the straight and won by three quarters of a length from Staphanos with Yamakatsu Ace half a length away in third. After the race Take said \\"I felt his strength had increased so I had all the confidence I needed. The race developed just the way I thought it would. Since he was responding so well, I decided to launch an early bid today, earlier than I would do in other cases.\\" Four weeks later the horse attempted to repeat his 2016 victory in the Tenno Sho and started the 2.2/1 favourite against eighteen opponents headed by Satono Diamond. After racing in second place behind the outsider Yamakatsu Raiden he took the lead entering the straight, opened up a clear advantage and stayed on in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths. Cheval Grand took second ahead of Satono Diamond and Admire Deus. The winning time of 3:12.5 broke the record for the race, which had been set by Deep Impact in 2006. Take commented, \\"It was a really tough race, the pace never slowed down. Although the horse had little left, he showed amazing stamina and tenacity up to the end which only he can do. I never thought Deep Impact's record would ever be broken. This horse is just so much stronger than he was a year ago\\". In June Kitasan Black ran for the second time in the Takarazuka Kinen and started favourite against ten opponents. After tracking the leader Cheval Grand he was unable to quicken in the straight and finished eighth behind Satono Crown. Take was unable to explain the performance, saying \\"It didn't rain much so it didn't have much influence on the ground. He was in good form and there was no disadvantage either. He just didn't respond as he usually does. To be honest, I really don't know why\\". Hisashi Shimizu later suggested that the horse might still have been feeling the effects of his run in the Tenno Sho. In autumn 2017 Kitasan Black was sent directly to the Tenno Sho on 29 October without a prep race. Before the race it was made clear that the horse would retire at the end of the season and would have only two further races: the Japan Cup and the Arima Kinen. His bid to take the prize for a record third time was opposed by seventeen rivals including Satono Crown, Real Steel, Makahiki and the three- year-old filly Soul Stirring (Yushun Himba). Starting the 2/1 favourite he made an unusually slow start but recovered and moved up to join the leaders approaching the final turn. He took the lead early in the straight and held off a sustained challenge from Satono Crown to win by a neck. Take said \\"He was a bit too eager today and missed his break... He responded beautifully in the stretch and before we knew it, we were at the front. He weakened a little during the long drive but held on well\\". On 26 November the horse started favourite as he attempted to repeat his 2016 success in the Japan Cup. He took the lead soon after the start and maintained his advantage into the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Cheval Grand and the three-year-old Rey de Oro. On his farewell appearance at Nakayama on 24 December Kitasan Black made his third attempt to win the Arima Kinen and started favourite in a sixteen-runner field, with the best fancied of his opponents were Satono Crown, Cheval Grand and the improving three-year-old Suave Richard. After taking the lead from the start he broke clear of his rivals in the straight and recorded a \\"comfortable\\" length and a half victory from the mare Queens Ring, with Cheval Grand and Suave Richard close behind in third and fourth. The first prize money took his lifetime earnings to 1,876,843,000 yen, breaking the Japanese record held since 2001 by T M Opera O. Take commented \\"I‚Äôm so happy. I wanted to meet the fan's expectations, so I wanted to win no matter what. It was an honor to meet such a fine horse, and I had a great time as a jockey\\" while Shimizu said \\"All the races are good memories whether he won or lost\\". Assessment and awards In the JRA Awards for 2015 Kitasan Black finished runner-up to Duramente in the voting for the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Colt and fourth in the poll to determine the Japanese Horse of the Year.

The tramway is sometimes referred to as the Dreckly Express. Purposes The tramway was developed around 1900 by the castle's owner - Lord St Levan - to haul supplies ranging from building materials to groceries up to the castle and dustbins downhill. A notable traffic was Lord St Levan's regalia for the Coronation in 1953. It has never operated a passenger service, though one was contemplated in the late 1930s. The route The track in the lower loading area in 1984 The single track tramway originally ran from the quayside, but some years ago it was cut back to start from a short, level, enclosed loading area. At the castle end of this loading area the line plunges into a tunnel and begins its ascent which is entirely in tunnel. Most of the tunnel was built using the cut and cover method, with just the uppermost few yards being bored through granite. The tunnel is generally about wide and high, except for the section through granite which is about high. The line is level only at the loading areas at its ends. In between it runs on slopes ranging from 1 in 14 (7.14 %) near the foot to 1 in 1.9 (52.6%) for the last , giving a total rise of , emerging near the castle's kitchens. Haulage The line's varying slopes and the curve near its foot makes the wire haulage rope more prone to thrashing than most rope-worked lines, where gravity usually holds the rope in rollers. It receives its greatest wear nearest the tram, so by buying a rope deliberately longer than necessary it is possible to cut the worn end off three times before needing to replace the whole rope. Until the mid-1920s a gas engine provided the motive power. A Ruston petrol engine was then installed to provide electricity to the castle, enabling rechargeable batteries to be installed to power the tramway. In 1951 the island was connected to the National Grid, since when the rope has been powered by a AC motor. In 2018 the cable was reported to be wound by a Crompton Parkinson electric motor. The trams Tramway vehicle resembling a trunk, St Michael's Mount, Cornwall Several trams have been used over the years. That used in 1964 was built locally. It had a metal frame with a wooden floor lined with galvanised sheeting and wooden side planking, some of which could be lifted out by hand to make loading and unloading easier. The wheels were loose on their axles, which themselves were able to rotate.

ISIM is the heart of the JWST, and holds the main science payload which includes four science instruments and the fine guidance sensor. ISIM is the spacecraft chassis and instruments that take the light from the main mirror and convert that into the science data that is then sent back to Earth. The other two major sections of the JWST are the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) (mirror and their structure) and the Spacecraft Element (SE), which includes the Spacecraft Bus and Sunshield. ISIM has a mass of 1.4 metric tons (tonnes) (1.54 US tons). The infrared camera instrument integrated with ISIM passed its thermal tests in early 2016. ISIM underwent intense thermal cold testing in late 2015 to early 2016. NIRcam is extremely important to JWST, because it's not only a sensitive infrared camera, but it is also used to adjust the alignment of the main mirror segments. The tests were very positive because NIRcam showed was very stable through vibration and thermal testing. NIRcam was installed into ISIM in March 2014, and then underwent integration and testing after that, as the telescope is readied for its 2019 launch. ISIM is about 23% of the overall mass of JWST, which equates to an ISIM mass of 1400 kg (3086 lb).eoPortal - JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) Summary ISIM Electronics Compartment (IEC) ISIM contains these instruments: *Near-Infrared Camera, or NIRCam *Near- Infrared Spectrograph, or NIRSpec. *Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI *Fine Guidance Sensor/ Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph , or FGS/NIRISS ISIM also includes the MIRI crycooler, which extends down into the Spacecraft Bus (on the hot side of the spacecraft). Relevant systems and subsystems the ISIM: *Optical metering structure *ISIM Electronics Compartment (IEC) *harness radiator *ISIM Command and Data Handling System (ICDH) *ISIM Remote Services Unit (IRSU) *electrical harness system *thermal control system *flight software system *on-board script system Three regions to ISIM were defined by NASA to aid in its production. The three regions include the cryogenic instrument module (1), the electronics compartment (2), and finally the Command and Data Handling subsystem and MIRI crycooler(3), which is inside the spacecraft bus physically. MIRI needs to be colder than the other instruments so it has an additional cooler. MIRI is the mid-infrared instrument. The Command and Data Handling subsystem uses the spacecraft on- board communication standard called SpaceWire. SpaceWire was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), and provides low-power data communication at up to 200 Mbits per second. Regions: *Cryogenic instrument module *Electronics Compartment (ISIM Electronics Compartment (IEC)) *ISIM Command and Data Handling subsystem (ICDH) **This is located inside the Spacecraft Bus (JWST) **Also includes MIRI cryocooler In May 2016, OTE and ISIM were merged into what is called OTIS, which is the combination of these two regions.Maurice Te Plate, et al. \\"JWST‚Äôs near infrared spectrograph status and first OTIS test results\\", Proc. SPIE 10698, Space Telescopes and Instrumentation 2018: Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave, 1069807 (6 July 2018); https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2312651 = ISIM Electronics Compartment (IEC)= The ISIM Electronics Compartment (IEC) is a section of ISIM that houses computing and electrical resources for the instruments. The main electronics for each of the instruments is housed in this thermally wrapped box. In 2014 the electronics for NIRspec were installed in the IEC. The IEC is mounted to the cryogenic structure of the main telescope, and the enclosure must maintain a much warmer temperature for the electronics inside, but not allow that heat to negatively affect the main telescope. The box can dissipate about 200 watts of electrical power. One of the considerations is to direct the majority of the heat (radiatively) in a roughly 20 degree angle in between the back of the main mirror structure and instruments and the sunshield. Not too close to the back of the telescope or too close to the sunshield, but by using baffles and insulation, direct the heat out into space. The IEC box sits just below most of the instruments and behind it, but above the spacecraft bus. There is one side that is made of aluminum and the other sides are composite. It is wrapped in multiple layers of insulation including six layers of SLI (the JWST Single Layer Insulation). Some of the features for thermal (heat) management include a parasitic tray radiator and baffles. IEC constitutes region 2 of ISIM.

He was a careful illustrator and cartographer. He travelled extensively in Brazil around 1882-83. His most famous published work was A √çndia Portuguesa (1886) with many engravings made by Francisco Pastor (1850-1922). Mendes was born in a rural family in Vila Real in northern Tr√°s-os-Montes on January 30, 1835. He went to study at the Polytechnic Academy of Porto in 1853. He then studied at the Lisbon Agricultural Institute joining as a \\"farmer and veterinarian\\" and completed studies in 1858. His aptitude for drawing was noted and his broad training led him to be chosen by the Ministry of the Navy and Overseas of Portugal for a mission to India that began in August 1862. He travelled to Goa and studied the land, the forests and agriculture in the region. He published a note in 1864 Apontamentos sobre a prov√≠ncia de Satari do Estado da √çndia Portuguesa. He was also elected member of the Lisbon Geographical Society. In 1882 he travelled to Brazil landing in Rio de Janeiro. He visited Bel√©m in July 1883 and visited the Amazon region. Mendes' books have been of use to historians of Goa as many of the buildings illustrated are now partly or fully destroyed and his notes are sources for the lifestyle of the period. The unpublished notes and diaries of Lopes Mendes are part of the collection of Paulo Fontainha Geyer and now part of the Brazilian Museum. It includes drawings, newspaper accounts and letters.

Yowalah it is the distinctive in both its music and dancing. Leather bagpipes, flute and drums are the traditional musical instrument played during the dance. History Al-Ayyala is a popular and expressive cultural performance practised in north-western Oman and throughout the United Arab Emirates. Al-Ayyala involves chanted poetry, drum music and dance, and simulates a battle scene. Two rows of about twenty men face each other, carrying thin bamboo sticks to signify spears or swords. Between the rows musicians play large and small drums, tambourines and brass cymbals. The rows of men move their heads and sticks synchronously with the drum rhythm and chant poetic lyrics, while other performers move around the rows holding swords or guns, which they occasionally hurl to the sky and catch. In the United Arab Emirates, girls wearing traditional dresses stand at the front, tossing their long hair from side to side. The melody has seven tones in an irregular repeated pattern, and the chanted poetry varies according to the occasion. Al-Ayyala is performed during weddings and other festive occasions in both the Sultanate of Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Performers come from diverse backgrounds and age groups. The lead performer is usually an inherited role and is responsible for training others performers. Al-Ayyala is inclusive of all ages, genders and social classes. Yowalah is considered a victory dance, and it used to be performed usually after a victory in a tribal war or after returning from a successful pearl diving. The dance form is included in Unesco cultural heritage list. Al Ayyala and UNESCO UAE has successfully recorded Al Ayyala on UNESCOs Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage Items of Humanity in November 2014, in cooperation with Oman. Being part of this important list will contribute towards reviving and promoting Al Ayyala as part of the region's national identity and the heritage of humanity as a whole. Additionally, this listing helps in transferring knowledge, skills, and the values of Al Ayyala from one generation to another - and contributes towards achieving respect, mutual understanding, and peace amongst the people of the UAE.

In general, Ukhaatherium weighing about 32 g was quite small and resembled today's insect eaters. In addition, there were still some original skeletal features. Characteristics Fossil findings Since the year 1990 joint expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences took place in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia, in order to investigate Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary vertebrates. Alone more than 500 skulls of mammals were discovered at the Ukhaa Tolgod fossil field in the Nemegt Basin discovered in 1993, together with outstanding fossil dinosaurs - both skeletons, eggs and embryos -, birds and lizards. The discovery of two mammalian species from the early stages of the development of Eutheria, including the first known one from Ukhaatherium and another from Zalambdalestes, were prominent. These originate from the Djadochta Formation, which is dated to Campanian about 84 to 72 million years ago.

It is an extensive area of mixed native broadleaved woodlands overlying rocks of the Old Red Sandstone. It forms one of the largest continuous blocks of deciduous woodland in this part of Herefordshire. The soils which range from acid to alkaline and front wet to dry gives rise to a diverse woodland structure. Most of the upper plateau is dominated by sessile oak (Quercus petraea) woodland. In some areas this is associated with field maple (Acer campestre) and in others with ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Other species include hazel (Corylus avellana) and the locally rare wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis). In the woodland on the slopes, ash tends to become more dominant, often in association with birch (Betula pendula) on the drier areas and alder (Alnus glutinosa) in the wetter areas. In the south eastern part of the site is an extensive area of wild cherry (Prunus avium) and ash with a hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and hazel understorey. The variety of soils give rise to a similarly diverse ground flora which includes bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), great butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and common spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and spurge laurel (Daphne laureola). The woods have a rich fauna which includes fallow deer (Dama dama).

Career 1812 The Royal Navy commissioned Bachus in 1808 under Lieutenant Samuel Malbon. In early August Bacchus sailed with a flag of truce to the Oronoque carrying a three-man delegation.The Essequebo & Demerary Royal Gazette, Vol. 3, ‚Ññ136, 6 August 1808. In 1809 Lieutenant Charles Deyman Jermy (or Jeremy) replaced Malbon. In February Jermy and Bacchus were at the invasion of Martinique. Four decades later the operation was among the actions recognised by the clasp \\"Martinique\\" attached to the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM), awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. A British squadron under Captain George Miller in arrived at Deshaies on 12 December to reconnoiter the harbour. There they found the French navy's brig Nisus about to leave, having loaded a cargo of coffee. Miller sent in boats with the marines from Thetis, , , and Bacchus, and 78 sailors. The landing party first captured the fort at Deshaies, whereupon Nisus surrendered when the landing party turned the fort's guns on herguns were turned on her. During the operation, kept up a six-hour cannonade on Nisus and the battery. Many of the 300 men in the battery fled, as did most of the crew of Nisus before the British could take possession. The British destroyed the battery before withdrawing. British casualties amounted to two men from Thetis being wounded on shore, and two men being wounded on Attentive. The Royal Navy took Nisus into service as HMS Guadeloupe. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"13 Dec. Boat Service 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the boat action. Later, Bacchus repelled an attack by two French privateer schooners. In the attack the British had five men severely wounded.O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.529. Bacchus then participated in the capture of Guadeloupe. This led to the award in 1847 of the NGSM with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\".

It was only after 1982, once Mercedes-Benz had been persuaded to supply steel bodied coaches with right hand drive, that Wahl's UK operation was able to switch to Mercedes bodied Mercedes-Benz O303 touring coaches similar to those used elsewhere (though still modified in order to respect the UK's unique regulatory requirements). Wahl & S√∂hne KG (previously Wilhelm Wahl & S√∂hne and W. Wahl & S√∂hne KG) was a bus and coach operator based in Heidenheim an der Brenz between 1926 and 1986. By the 1970s Its principal activities involved providing touring coaches for international coach holidays and operating most of the local bus services in the Heidenheim district. With a fleet of around 400 buses and coaches, Wahl was believed to have become the largest privately owned bus company in Europe. In 1986 the business underwent a high-profile bankruptcy. Dr. Fritz Wahl, who had by this time succeeded the elder generation and was in charge of the business, disappeared. Some time later he was located in Mexico: he faced a criminal investigation in connection with the company's financial collapse. History On 6 August 1926 two brothers, Wilhelm (1903‚Äì1969) and Albert Wahl (1901‚Äì1976), set up a bus service between Heidenheim and nearby Schnaitheim. They operated the service with an 18-seat Ford bus. Just two months later they acquired a second bus. Additional local routes were opened up to Oggenhausen, Voithsiedlung and Mergelstetten. From 1930 company contracts provided for further expansion, and cunning timetabling was also used to build passenger numbers. In a region where punctuality is highly valued, the Wahl buses were scheduled to depart just slightly earlier than the corresponding postbus services. At the railway station, while the postbus was still waiting for the letters and parcels to be loaded from the train, the Wahl bus was already departing, so that only a minority of slow moving passengers were left to use the postbus. During the 1930s Wahl sought to compete with the railways, not simply locally along the Brenz valley, but further afield, offering direct travel to Stuttgart via Wei√üenstein and G√∂ppingen at prices which significantly undercut those of the national rail company. The buses were well filled, but then the company were forbidden to operate along the route. In order to work around the prohibition the buses stopped short of central Stuttgart at suburbs such as Cannstatt or Untert√ºrkheim from where passengers could complete their journeys by tram. Then these routes were also banned, which was enforced through police confiscation of buses between G√∂ppingen und Stuttgart. At this point Wahl gave up on trying to compete with the trains on routes to Stuttgart. During the war the company buses and employees were conscripted for war work, and were even required to provide some of the services previously operated by the postbuses. The postwar decades saw a massive increase in the population of Heidenheim and the surrounding region, fed by refugees from the east and economic migrants from the regions administered between 1945 and 1949 as the Soviet occupation zone. The registered population in the Heidenheim administrative district increased from 62,281 in 1939 to 111,300 in 1960. Recognising the needs and opportunities that the situation represented, Wahl created a town centre bus network supplemented with several adjacent cross-country bus routes. In 1947 the municipal authorities set up their own publicly funded rival operation, \\"Kraftverkehr Heidenheim GmbH\\", with routes connecting Heidenheim with Oberkochen and Giegen with Staufen. Six years later, in 1953, the municipality's public bus company was dissolved and its routes were taken over by Wahl and the national postbus operator. In 1955 Wahl was operating 37 vehicles. By this time the economy of what had become, in May 1949, the German Federal Republic (West Germany), was growing strongly and disposable incomes were increasing to a point where many people could contemplate foreign holidays. Wahl itself grew strongly during the later 1950s and 1960s, both in respect of local bus services and of internationally used touring coaches. By the mid 1960s, with a fleet of over 70 buses and coaches, Wahl had become one of the largest private companies of its kind in West Germany. In Heidenheim a 30-minute frequency was introduced for the city buses, and additional suburbs such as Erbisberg and Mittelrain were added to the local network. In 1970 a travel agency was opened at the K√∂nigstra√üe in Stuttgart. In 1971 an important contract was concluded with American Express for Wahl to provide touring coaches to be used for European coach tours sold to customers by American Express from America and other, mostly English speaking, countries outside Europe. Over the next few years similar deals were entered into with Global Tours and Trafalgar Tours. The company opened an international subsidiary, \\"Wahl International GmbH\\" in Frankfurt. Dr. Fritz Wahl took over the leadership of the business. The vehicle fleet grew from year to year, reaching 400 and comprising not simply Mercedes-Benz bus and coaches, but also those manufactured and / or powered by Setra, MAN and Magirus-Deutz. In July 1983 Regine Wahl, Dr. Wahl's daughter, married Patrick Reynolds, the orphaned scion of a US tobacco dynasty. Various high-profile celebrities, including Prince Johannes of Thurn und Taxis, a Kashoggi heir and the widow of a former Mexican president, were guests at the \\"dream wedding\\" ceremony. The son in law went on to be employed in the family business. However, the marriage ended two years later, formally in 1985, and Reynolds would assert his notability not as a bus and coach operator, but as a movie actor and anti-tobacco activist. The move into luxury international coach tourism was a great success. In 1984 Fritz Wahl spotted another international opportunity, this time in China. \\"It is instantly apparent what's wrong with China. So many people on bicycles, or walking long distances. They need motor transport, motor transport and then more motor transport.\\"\\"Man sieht sofort, woran es in China fehlt. So viele Menschen auf Fahrr√§dern, zu Fu√ü √ºber weite Strecken. Die brauchen Fahrzeuge, Fahrzeuge und nochmals Fahrzeuge.\\" So he purchased a lot of used buses in West Germany and sold them on in China. Dr. Wahl was never shy of publicity, and the regional minister-president, Lothar Sp√§th was present for the signing of one particularly large contract, for the sale of 500 buses in China. In the mid-1980s, as Wahl expanded its business remit, ugly rumours began to circulate as to the company's solvency. There were suspicions that the expansion was, at best, injudiciously funded. The public bus network had been ringing up deficits for the years, while the tourist coach business was highly cyclical, and vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations. The company structure, in practice, gave the chief executive and owner almost unconstrained freedom to run his business as he saw fit, and when he ran into cash flow difficulties he adopted what he would later identify as \\"emergency measures\\" (\\"Notma√ünahmen\\"). Buses were sold that he had not yet paid for, meaning that they were still the property of their manufacturers. Another variation involved securing bank debts against the value of buses which, since he had not paid for them, Wahl did not own. After the business began to unravel, it emerged that there were sometimes several banks who each thought they had first call on the same bus which they had accepted as collateral. When he found himself having to explain matters to a court, Dr. Wahl explained \\"I extinguished one fire with another fire. It was a kerfaffel (ein Kuddelmuddel)\\". Even the judge, Werner Meinhold, was unsure what to make of the matter: \\"It's all a bit very confused\\".\\"Das ist alles ein bi√üchen sehr verworren.\\" In desperation Wahl turned to minister-president, Lothar Sp√§th and Sp√§th's colleague, the Baden-W√ºrttemberg's economics minister, . There was talk of the regional government providing financial guarantees. But now events assumed their own momentum. The company applied for a \\"scheme of arrangement\\" (\\"Vergleichsantrag\\") with its creditors, but such an arrangement would have required the agreement of creditors and of the court. What followed for the company, in May 1986, was a compulsory bankruptcy. A day later Dr. Wahl and his wife disappeared, leaving behind them a shortfall of fifty million marks. An international arrest warrant was issued, but there could be no arrest while the doctor's whereabouts remained unknown. Dr Wahl was located and, in August 1989, arrested in Mexico City. It is hard to know how much effort had been made to locate him in the intervening years. Two investigative journalists, Oliver Schr√∂m and Stefan Scheytt, made their way to Mexico City, hoping to be able to interview Wahl in his jail cell. They found that he was listed in the city telephone directory, and they were able to use the information in the directory to visit his home where they found his wife, Lotte. Fritz Wahl had been working hard in the industry he knew, as a consultant with a Mexican bus manufacturer. The reporters returned to West Germany with enough material to support a series of articles. However, Dr. Wahl refused to receive them in his Mexican prison cell. As matters turned out, at the time when he was found in Mexico Dr Wahl still had not sold on all his unpaid for buses, nor handed them over to the banks who had accepted them as security on debts. Back in Germany, in May 1991 Fritz Wahl received a three and a half year jail term for deception and embezzlement. After he had served his sentence he went back to live in Mexico where, in 2008, he died. The W√ºrttemberg Railway Company and the municipality teamed up to launch the Heidenheimer Verkehrsgesellschaft (HVG / Heidenheim [public] Transport Company) on 1 May 1987, using assets recovered following the Wahl bankruptcy. By that time the luxury coach fleet had already disappeared from the company books, during its unsuccessful struggle for survival. HVG is focused on scheduled services, with only very limited involvement in private hire and one-time contracts.

Fran√ßoise Antoinette with her eldest daughter. Auguste-Fr√©d√©ric de Talhou√´t-Bonamour, marquis de Talhou√´t (8 April 1788, Rennes - 12 March 1842, Paris) was a French general of the Napoleonic Wars. He was awarded the Military Merit Order along with several French orders. Life The son of Louis C√©leste de Talhou√´t-Bonamour (1761-1812), marquis de Talhou√´t, and his wife √âlisabeth Baude de La Vieuville (1764-1814), Auguste de Talhou√´t first joined the army in 1804 in a light infantry regiment. He studied at the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Fontainebleau and graduated as a sous-lieutenant in the 15th Horse Chasseurs Regiment. He took part in the Prussian campaign, becoming Napoleon's ordnance officer in 1807, a captain in 1809 after the battle of Wagram, a baron of the Empire on 3 August 1810, chef d'escadron in 1811 and an officer of the L√©gion d'honneur on 29 September 1813 after the battle of Borodino, where he routed a Russian battalion (he had already been made a l√©gionnaire of the L√©gion d'honneur on 11 July 1807). A few days after Borodino he was appointed colonel of the Mounted Grenadier regiment in the Imperial Guard. Seriously wounded on the retreat from Russia, he only survived thanks to one of his men dragging him to an ambulance. In 1814 he shifted his allegiance from Napoleon to the restored French monarchy and on 27 December that year was promoted to commander of the L√©gion d'honneur. He was also made a knight of the Order of the Reunion on 3 April and of the Order of Saint Louis on 27 June that year. He took no action for either side during the Hundred Days and so in September 1815 was appointed mar√©chal de camp and commander of the Mounted Grenadier Regiment in the Royal Guard. In 1817 he married Alexandrine Roy (1799-1854), daughter of count Antoine Roy, several times minister of finance after the Restoration, bringing de Talhou√´t a substantial fortune and two children. Their son Auguste √âlisabeth Joseph Bon-Amour de Talhou√´t-Roy (1819-1884), marquis de Talhou√´t married L√©onie Marie Isidore D√©sir√©e Sidonie Honnorez (1829-1892) in 1847 and had issue, whilst their daughter Fran√ßoise Antoinette √âlisabeth Sophie de Talhou√´t-Roy (1818-1863) married Armand G√©raud Victurnien Jacques Emmanuel de Crussol (1808-1872), 11th duke of Uz√®s in 1836 and had issue. Promoted to a peer of France on 5 March 1819 before leaving active service, he voted for the right in the upper chamber, took the oath of obedience to the July Monarchy and was member and president of the general counsel for Sarthe, the department which included the ch√¢teau du Lude he had inherited from his mother.

The lead‚Äìcrime hypothesis is the proposed link between elevated blood lead levels in children and increased rates of crime, delinquency, and recidivism later in life. Lead is widely understood to be highly toxic to multiple organs of the body, particularly the brain. Individuals exposed to lead at young ages are more vulnerable to learning disabilities, decreased I.Q., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and problems with impulse control, all of which may be negatively impacting decision making and leading to the commission of more crimes as these children reach adulthood, especially violent crimes. No safe level of lead in the human bloodstream exists given that any amount can contribute to deleterious health issues. Proponents of the lead‚Äìcrime hypothesis argue that the removal of lead additives from motor fuel, and the consequent decline in children's lead exposure, explains the fall in crime rates in the United States beginning in the 1990s. This hypothesis also offers an explanation of the earlier rise in crime in the preceding decades as the result of increased lead exposure throughout the mid-20th century. The lead‚Äìcrime hypothesis is not mutually exclusive with other explanations of the drop in US crime rates such as the legalized abortion and crime effect. Lead exposure during the years in question correlated with exposure to urban poverty, due to close residential or primary school proximity with high-density motor vehicle traffic burning leaded gasoline or from residing in older, poorly maintained housing stock, much of which contained high levels of lead in the form of lead paint, lead solder, or other lead-based building materials; additionally, municipalities with a low taxation base often continued to receive drinking water via degraded lead pipes rather than upgrading to modern infrastructure. The difficulty in measuring the effect of lead exposure on crime rates lies in separating the effect from other indicators of low socioeconomic status such as poorer schools, nutrition, and medical care, exposure to other pollutants, and other variables that are predictive of criminal behavior. Background Lead is a naturally occurring metal of bluish-grey color that has been used for multiple purposes in the history of human civilization. Being soft and pliable, as well as resistant to corrosion compared to other metals, has resulted in lead being used for many different items across time. Some of the earliest items made from lead were beads and jewelry dating back to 7th millennium B.C. Its malleability made lead an ideal choice for the Romans to build pipes for transporting water. Furthermore, lead acetate (also referred to as \\"sugar of lead\\") has been reported to have been used medicinally in the past. However, it was also noted that exposure to lead may have health consequences. The botanist Nicander was one of the first to write about the uses of lead. Dioscorides would later report that \\"the mind gives way\\" in individuals exposed to lead. Nonetheless, despite the hazards posed by lead, its durability made it useful and it was added to items such as glass, paint, and eventually gasoline. The widespread substance is also able to function as a shield against various forms of radiation. The use of leaded products such as lead paint and leaded gasoline have resulted in higher environmental levels of lead in the air and soil. Lead is also a stable element and does not break down in the environment, so it must be physically removed. Most cases of lead exposure occur via inhalation or ingestion, though transdermal exposure is also possible. Once in the body lead has a half-life of approximately 30 days if in the blood, but can remain in the body for 20 to 30 years if it has accumulated in bones and organs. Expanded scientific investigation into organolead chemistry and the varied ways in which human biology changes due to lead exposure took place throughout the 20th century. Although it has continued to be in wide use even into the 21st century, greater understanding of blood lead levels (BLLs) and other factors have meant that a new scientific consensus has emerged. No safe level of lead in the human bloodstream exists as such; any amount can contribute to neurological problems and other health issues. Analyses of the role of lead exposure in the brain have been ongoing for the past few decades. Lead can interfere with numerous neurotransmitter systems in the brain, most likely because of its ability to mimic calcium. Exposure to lead can also alter brain structure and function. At the behavioral level, exposure to lead has been observed to cause increases in impulsiveMendelsohn, A. L., Dreyer, B. P., Fierman, A. H., Rosen, C. M., Legano, L. A., Kruger, H. A., ... & Courtlandt, C. D. (1998). Low-level lead exposure and behavior in early childhood. Pediatrics, 101(3), e10-e10. actions and social aggression, as well as the possibility of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Those conditions likely influence personality traits and behavioral choices, with examples including having poor job performance, beginning a pattern of substance abuse, and undergoing teenage pregnancy. Evidence that lead exposure contributes to lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores goes back to a seminal 1979 study in Nature, with later analysis finding the link particularly robust. The heavy metal lead can be found readily in the environment, especially in urban and industrialized areas. The majority of modern day environmental lead contamination can be traced back to leaded paint and the addition of tetraethyllead and tetramethyllead to gasoline, though other sources have contributed as well. Though some of the hazards of lead exposure have been documented for centuries, recognition of the hazards posed did not appear to gain much traction until the 1960s with the Senate hearings of Edmund MuskieCommittee on Public Works, Hearings before a Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution, United States Senate, 89th Congress, Second Section on S-3112 and S-3400, Washington, DC, 1966. that would help lead to the phaseout of leaded gasoline and lead-based paint in the 1970s. Blood lead levels would drop notably soon after the phaseout. In the decades since, scientists have concluded that no safe threshold for lead exposure exists. Though efforts to reduce environmental levels of lead were initially slowed down by the lead industry, the emergence of Clair Patterson in the 1960s would lead to more meaningful changes. The establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and the influence of the Consumer Product Safety Commission would help ensure that gasoline and paint could only contain trace amounts of lead. Furthermore, several major legislative acts were passed to help reduce the amount of lead being introduced into the environment, including the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Lead Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. The international process of trying to lower the prevalence of lead has been largely spearheaded by the Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles (PCFV). The non-governmental organization partners with major oil companies, various governmental departments, multiple civil society groups, and other such institutions worldwide. Efforts to phase-out lead in transport fuel achieved major gains in over seventy-five nations. In discussions at the 2002 Earth Summit, institutions under the umbrella of the United Nations vowed to emphasize public‚Äìprivate partnerships (PPPs) in order to help developing and transitional countries go unleaded. Research on lead‚Äìcrime correlation The lead-crime hypothesis arose out of the confluence of several events, primarily the decrease in crime rates in the 1990s and the reduction of environmental lead pollution in the 1970s. After decades of relatively steady increases, crime rates in the United States started to sharply decline in the 1990s. The trend continued into the new millennium. Multiple possible explanations have come about, with academic studies pointing to complex, multifactorial causation as different social trends occurred at the same time. The fact that in the United States anti-lead efforts took place simultaneously alongside falls in violent crime rates attracted attention from researchers. Changes were not uniform across the country, even while increasingly stringent Environmental Protection Agency rules went into force from 1970s onward. Several areas had far greater lead exposure compared to others for years. While there is strong evidence indicating that genetics influence the development of violent and aggressive behavior, more recent attention has focused on environmental factors such as lead exposure.Raine, A. (2014). The anatomy of violence: The biological roots of crime. New York: NY, Vintage. Though there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that knowledge of a relationship between lead exposure and behavior dates back centuries, direct observations would not be documented until the late 1800s.Gibson, J. L., Love, W., Hardie, D., Bancroft, P., & Turner, A. J. (1892). Notes on lead-poisoning as observed among children in Brisbane. In Proceedings of the Third Intercolonial Medical Congress, Sydney, Australia (pp. 76-83). Research in the mid-1900s observed that children previously treated for lead poisoning displayed a series of aberrant behaviors, including violence and aggression. Further research has yielded similar results, finding that past lead exposure functions as a predictor for criminal activity. Nation-wide analyses have also demonstrated positive associations between air-lead concentrations and measures of criminality and homicide. A meta-analysis of studies examining the relationship between lead and conduct problems arrived at a similar conclusion, suggesting that the magnitude of the relationship between lead exposure and behavior is comparable to the relationship between lead exposure and I.Q. While the scientific literature suggests there is a relationship between lead exposure and behavioral issues such as delinquency and criminality, directly relating these observations to the decrease in overall criminality is more difficult. According to Jessica Wolpaw Reyes of Amherst College, between 1992 and 2002 the phase-out of lead from gasoline in the U.S. \\"was responsible for approximately a 56% decline in violent crime\\". While cautioning that the findings relating to \\"murder are not robust if New York and the District of Columbia are included,\\" Wolpaw Reyes concluded: \\"Overall, the phase-out of lead and the legalization of abortion appear to have been responsible for significant reductions in violent crime rates.\\" She additionally speculated that by \\"2020, all adults in their 20s and 30s will have grown up without any direct exposure to gasoline lead during childhood, and their crime rates could be correspondingly lower.\\" According to Reyes, \\"Childhood lead exposure increases the likelihood of behavioral and cognitive traits such as impulsivity, aggressivity, and low IQ that are strongly associated with criminal behavior\\".Brazilian-German economist Achim Steiner, speaking as then head of the U.N. Environment Programme, described anti-lead efforts as a key sustainable development success. A 2011 study by the California State University found that \\"Ridding the world of leaded petrol, with the United Nations leading the effort in developing countries, has resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, 1.2 million fewer premature deaths, higher overall intelligence and 58 million fewer crimes\\", according to the United Nations News Centre. The executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Achim Steiner argued that \\"Although this global effort has often flown below the radar of [the] media and global leaders, it is clear that the elimination of leaded petrol is an immense achievement on par with the global elimination of major deadly diseases.\\" According to a May 2017 study, lead exposure in childhood substantially increased school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys in Rhode Island, suggesting that the phasing out of leaded gasoline may explain a significant part of the decline in crime in the United States beginning in the 1990s. A 2018 longitudinal study conducted in New Zealand found only a weak association between childhood lead levels and criminal conviction, which was no longer significant after controlling for sex. In New Zealand, there is no correlation between lead exposure and socioeconomic status, thus social class does not act as a confounder. The authors conclude that \\"past studies of the association between BLL and crime, in which high BLL and low socioeconomic status were associated, may not have completely overcome confounding\\".

In: We_magazine Volume 02 and based on open design and open source principles. Open manufacturing combines the following elements of a production process: new open production tools and methods (such as 3D printers), new value-based movements (such as the maker movement), new institutions and networks for manufacturing and production (such as FabLabs), and open source methods, software and protocols. Open manufacturing may also include digital modeling and fabrication and computer numeric control (CNC) of the machines used for production through open source software and open source hardware. The philosophy of open manufacturing is close to the open-source movement, but aims at the development of physical products rather than software. The term is linked to the notion of democratizing technology as embodied in the maker culture, the DIY ethic, the open source appropriate technology movement, the Fablab-network and other rooms for grassroot innovation such as hackerspaces.  Principles  The openness of \\"open manufacturing\\" may relate to the nature of the product (open design), to the nature of the production machines and methods (e.g. open source 3D-printers, open source CNC), to the process of production and innovation (commons-based peer production / collaborative / distributed manufacturing), or to new forms of value creation (network-based bottom-up or hybrid versus business-centric top down).Dickel, Sascha, Ferdinand, Jan-Peter, Petschow, Ulrich: The Multiple Applications of 3D Printing: Between Maker Movements and the Future of Manufacturing.

Jeremy Rifkin argues, that open production through 3D-printing \\"will eventually and inevitably reduce marginal costs to near zero, eliminate profit, and make property exchange in markets unnecessary for many (though not all) products\\".

In the context of socioeconomic development, open manufacturing has been described as a path towards a more sustainable industrialization on a global scale, that promotes \\"social sustainability\\" and provides the opportunity to shift to a \\"collaboration-oriented industrialization driven by stakeholders from countries with different development status connected in a global value creation at eye level\\".S.

(2016) Ten Frontier Technologies for International Development. Brighton: IDS. Page 43. Online: In such a context, open manufacturing is strongly linked to the broader concept of Open Source Appropriate Technology movement. Views According to scholar Michel Bauwens, Open Manufacturing is \\"the expansion of peer production to the world of physical production\\". Redlich and Bruns define \\"Open Production\\" as \\"a new form of coordination for production systems that implies a superior broker system coordinating the information and material flows between the stakeholders of production\\", and which will encompass the entire value creation process for physical goods: development, manufacturing, sales, support etc.Redlich, T.; Bruhns, F.-L.: Open Production - a new broker- based approach to interactive value creation and user manufacturing. In: 2008 Proceedings of the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE) Vol. 4, Design and Manufacturing, , pp. 181-189 A policy paper commissioned by the European Commission uses the term \\"maker manufacturing\\" and positions it between social innovation, open source ICT and manufacturing. Criticism A number of factors are seen to hamper the broad- based application of the model of \\"open manufacturing\\" and / or to realize its positive implications for more sustainable global production pattern. The first factor is the sustainability of commons-based peer production models: \\"Empowerment happens only, if the participants are willing to share their knowledge with their colleagues. The participation of the actors cannot be guaranteed, thus there are many cases known, where participation could only be insufficiently realized\\". Other problems include missing or inadequate systems of quality control, the persistent paradigm of high-volume manufacturing and its cost-efficiency, the lack of widely adopted platforms to share hardware designs, as well as challenges linked to the joint-ownership paradigm behind the open licences of open manufacturing and the fact, that hardware is much more difficult to share and to standardize than software. In developing countries, a number of factors need to be considered in addition to the points above. Scholar Waldman-Brown names the following: lack of manufacturing expertise and informality of current SMMs in emerging markets as an obstacle to quality control for final products and raw material as well as universities and vocational training programs not apt to react rapidly enough to provide the necessary knowledge and qualifications.

The CEO of Quid Inc., an artificial intelligence company, Goodson studied medieval literature at Oxford University, and co-founded Quid based on his interest in applying language theory to semantic search. Early life and education Goodson grew up on a farm in Norfolk, England. He taught himself to program as a child, and started writing programs for video games at 8. In 1998, as he completed his final year of high school, he received a Norfolk Scholars Award, which recognizes high achieving students from backgrounds traditionally less likely to go to university. Goodson began college in 1999 at the University of East Anglia. He graduated with honors in 2002 with a degree in English literature and philosophy. He subsequently received a scholarship from the UK Arts and Humanities Research Board, one of only 10 scholarships in the country available in his field, and began postgraduate studies in medieval literature and language theory at University College, Oxford. His graduate research focused on the analysis of medieval cento. Goodson had started several businesses before he began college, and while at UEA, he started a yoga club, a design company, Inspired, and a publishing company, Prana. In 2002, Goodson co-founded Oxford Entrepreneurs, a student society designed to connect scientists with business-minded students to support and facilitate entrepreneurship. He served as the organization's founding chairman. In November 2003, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin and other Silicon Valley executives spoke at an Oxford Entrepreneurs event. At a dinner Goodson hosted for the speakers, Levchin discussed the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the Valley. Goodson, then 23, saw an opportunity to bring his interests in language, technology, and business together. \\"Blown away by learning about those businesses,\\" Goodson flew to Palo Alto, where he had lunch with Levchin and Peter Thiel. Levchin offered him a job as the lead designer within a startup incubator, and six months after their initial meeting at Oxford, Goodson took a sabbatical and moved to San Francisco. Career In April 2004, Goodson began working with Levchin at Midtown Doornail (an anagram of World Domination) as a product manager. An investment company and incubator, Midtown Doornail helped to create several successful internet companies, including Yelp. In September 2004, Goodson became Yelp's first employee. He remained at the company for four years, serving in various roles related to product management, UX and UI design and business development. In September 2007, Goodson founded YouNoodle with Kirill Makharinsky, an Oxford-trained mathematician, and Rebecca Hwang, an MIT graduate and Stanford Ph.D. candidate in network theory. The company was first funded by Levchin, Thiel's Founders Fund, and Charles Lho, among others.

Life and career  Marsili was born in Rome, Italy. At 21, after graduating in philosophy from the University of London, he established the Postanalytic Group in protest against the hegemony of analytical philosophy in the UK. Soon after he founded the quarterly cultural review Naked Punch together with contributors such as Noam Chomsky, Gayatry Spivak and Jacques Ranciere. After spending time in China and obtaining a second degree from the School of Oriental and African Studies he launched Transnational Dialogues, an exchange program between Chinese and European artists and activists. In 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, he established pan-European network European Alternatives, developing it into an international NGO with offices in London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. He established Transeuropa Festival and was the artistic director of the first four editions. In 2013 he launched the European Media Initiative, gathering 200,000 signatures to demand an EU directive on media freedom. In 2016, he became one of the initiators of the pan-European movement DiEM25, together with Yanis Varoufakis. He writes for various European newspapers, including The Guardian, El Diario, El Pa√≠s, Al Jazeera, Neues Deutschland, Il manifesto, Il Fatto Quotidiano, Huffington Post, OpenDemocracy. Marsili appears as a guest on Italian national TV (Rai3 and La7), Al Jazeera and is host of TalkReal, a nomadic Europe-wide talk show.  Political views Marsili is a staunch advocate of transnationalism and of the construction of a new cultural and political vision beyond the nation state. In his books Il Terzo Spazio and Citizens of Nowhere he responds directly to the crisis of the European Union and the rise of the nationalist right by proposing a third way between the maintaining the status quo and accepting the demise of the European project. Marsili has argued that \\"the nation-state is not the solution, but part of the problem\\", while strongly criticising the existing structures of the European Union. He has been defined as \\"the Italian response to the euro-sceptics\\", and is an outspoken advocate of the need for pan- European political parties. In a booklet written together with Niccolo Milanese, he has argued for the need of a pan-European constituent process to draft new Treaties for the European Union. In his book La tua patria √® il mondo intero, he outlines a comprehensive transnational vision merging European cosmopolitanism with Chinese thought. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020, Marsili and Ulrike Gu√©rot called for a \\"European republic of equals\\" where every citizen could enjoy the same social protections, benefit from the same economic support and pay the same taxes.

He was the commander of the rebel forces in Benghazi under the 17 February Brigade.  Biography  Al- Salabi is 39 years old from the Barga suburb of Benghazi. He was arrested in 1997 by the Gaddafi administration for his participation in a Benghazi-based clandestine network that offered shelter for Islamist rebels, including ones that were linked to the al-Qaeda linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). He was sentenced to 6 years in the Abu Salim prison, where he became an Islamist activist, and befriended the Belhadj brothers, one of whom was a jihadist that fought in Afghanistan and an LIFG commander before the 2011 civil war in Libya. Prior to his political involvement, Salabi was a businessman, but after the outbreak of the Libyan Civil War, he became characterized for his role as a military commander of the Islamist rebel groups. Al-Salabi has strong familial links to the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya. His father, Mohammed al-Salabi was a founding member of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya during the 1960s. Salabi's brother, Ali al-Salabi, is regarded as one of the most prominent leaders and thinkers in the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, as well as the overall Islamist movement in Libya.  Beliefs  In the early on sought of the Libyan Civil War, Salabi took a stand against emerging secular groups, whom he said were giving Islamists a bad reputation that was creating political divisions that were benefiting Muammar Gaddafi. However, both he and his brother have expressed their belief that Islamic sharia law requires a democratic, constitutional government. Additionally, In the aftermath of the revolution and war, Salabi advocated for the unfreezing of Gaddafi's assets to be given to Libya and used for the Libyan people for things such as education, medical aid, and security.  Leadership of Libyan rebels  Ismail al-Salabi is most known for his role as the military commander of the Libyan Islamist fighters, known as the February 17 brigade.[xii] Under his leadership, they defended Benghazi against Muammar Gaddafi's forces, and are often credited with leading a successful final defense attempt of Benghazi, where the uprising began. He originally commanded over 3,000 Islamist fighters, and reports up to the Interior Ministry of the National Transitional Council (NTC) in Tripoli. Wikileaks later revealed that he expressed belief that the NTC should step down because of its association of former Gaddafi officials. He also went on to form an independent command brigade, called the Martyr Rafallah Sahati Brigade during the anti-Qaddafi revolution. This brigade was responsible for the death of Abdel Fatah Yunis, a former general under Gaddafi who led the rebels‚Äô army.https://www.swp- berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2012C07_sbg.pdf His rebel group was known to be receiving significant Qatari aid, giving them an increase of power during the conflict. The NTC complained that Qatari support favored the Islamists, which may account for the rift between Salabi and the NTC.[xviii] His brother was the main distributor of Qatar's aid and military to the Libyan rebels, notably including his brother. Currently, Ismail al- Salabi is associated with the Benghazi Defense Companies (BDC), a group established to track down criminal followers of the former regime. These groups have been fighting against the polarizing figure, Khalifa Hifter, who controls much of eastern Libya. The group's only source of reference for funding and fighting comes from a religious authority that's headed by Sheikh Saidq al-Ghariani, who frequently expresses support for Islamist and jihadist factions in Libya. There is also increasing evidence of affiliations between BDC and al-Qaeda affiliates and coalitions. In his role as one of the most prominent Libyan Islamist militia leaders, he has grown to lead the Benghazi Revolutionaries‚Äô Shura Council coalition, which is made up of the most prominent militant Salafist organizations in Libya including Ansar al-Sharia, the Libyan al-Qaeda affiliate, the February 17 Brigade, and the Rafallah al- Sahati Brigade, exposing close ties with terrorism. He is accused by the Egyptian government of working with Qatar and Turkey to facilitate the movement of Libyan jihadists to join al-Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood-aligned rebel groups in Syria, as well as organizing an armed opposition army called the Free Egyptian Army to overthrow the al-Sisi government in Egypt.

However, after rebelling against King Henry II, his castle was demolished. Gervase founded the Cluniac Priory of St James in Dudley and probably founded the Church of St Thomas in Dudley. He died in 1194. The Paganells of Dudley Castle The ruins of Dudley Priory, founded by Gervase Paganell following the wishes of his father, Ralph The first of the family of Paganell to hold Dudley Castle and the barony of Dudley was Fulke Paganell around the year of 1100. Dudley Castle was originally a wooden Norman castle, built by Ansculf de Picquigny, a follower of William the Conqueror. At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, the castle was in the possession of his son William fitz Ansculf together with manors in the Home counties and the English Midlands, which were rewards for services to the Conqueror. Dudley Castle was the caput of the feudal barony. The Paganell family had origins in Normandy, where Fulke's father William was Lord of Moutiers Hubert. It is not clear how Fulke came into possession of the barony of Dudley. One suggestion is that he married Beatrice ferch William, a daughter of William FitzAnsculf, but it cannot be ruled out that he may have benefited from the previous owner being dispossessed after a failed rebellion. The family name is still attached to one of their former Buckinghamshire possessions, Newport Pagnell. Dudley Castle was converted to a stone fortification by Fulke or by Fulke's son and heir Ralph. In the struggle for power between King Stephen and Matilda, a period of history known as The Anarchy, Ralph took the side of Matilda, resulting in the castle being besieged by Stephen in 1138. Since the castle survived the siege, it is assumed the castle had been rebuilt in stone by that time. Ralph was made Governor of the Castle of Nottingham in 1140. Ralph's successor to the barony was his son, Gervase. Gervase Paganell A stone carving showing the seal of Gervase Paganell, situated near the ruins of Dudley Priory Although the exact date of Gervase becoming Lord of Dudley is not known, he had inherited by 1150. By 1154, he had married, his wife being the recently widowed Countess Isabel. She had been previously married to Simon de Senlis and was the daughter of Robert, Earl of Leicester. In 1166, he was assessed as holding 55 and two-thirds knight's fees. Gervase was involved in a failed rebellion against King Henry II in 1173‚Äì4 that resulted in an order that the castle be demolished. He was later restored to the king's favour after making him a payment of a fine of 500 marks. It is not clear how much of the original stone castle was demolished but it is usually assumed that the site remained an unfortified manor house until the second half of the 13th century. Gervase founded a Cluniac priory in Dudley dedicated to St James, fulfilling a wish of his father, Ralph. It is also thought that he founded the Church of St Thomas in Dudley. The church was originally dedicated to Thomas Becket who was killed in 1170 and canonized in 1173. Gervase attended the coronation of King Richard I in 1189. When he died in 1194, his heir was his sister Hawise, who had married John de Somery. Their son, Ralph de Somery became the next baron.

The mission of the organisation is to promote a more democratic, equal and culturally open Europe. It does it by providing participatory spaces, helping to develop alternative means of political, social, and cultural participation and by connecting local activists and organisations spread around Europe.  Origins  The organisation was established in London by Lorenzo Marsili and Niccol√≤ Milanese as a nonprofit company under UK law in February 2007 and was launched with the organisation of the London Festival of Europe in March 2007, marking the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome. The opening lecture was given by Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman and main partners included the London School of Economics, Tate Modern, and Courtauld Institute of Arts. Today, the organisation has offices in Paris, Berlin and Rome and organises activities across the EU, Ukraine and Turkey.  Mission and values  The organisation aims to promote the emergence of a transitional political space empowering citizens, civil society and social movements to act at European level and reclaim their democratic agency over EU policies. European Alternatives presents itself as an infrastructure empowering members, partners, and organisations across Europe to upscale and connect their work for greater influence and impact. The organisation also promotes the emergence of real transnational parties in Europe. The organisation favours greater democratic political integration in the European Union, but is critical of the status quo, claiming that \\"the current European regime is undermining its own claims to universal rights, democracy and justice\\". Its motto is \\"Democracy, Equality, Culture Beyond the Nation-State‚Äù.

Main activities  = Projects =  TRANSEUROPA Festival  Transeuropa Festival was born in 2007 in London as ‚ÄòLondon Festival of Europe‚Äô. Transeuropa Festival was a transnational festival of culture, arts and politics, taking place in different cities all over Europe (initially in sync and distributed, but later centered at specific location). Director of European Alternatives invites in 2015 participation to the Belgrade event, as organization operates both inside and outside the current European Union. Through a series of linked practices, events and discourses it produces a shared and collaborative space to develop transnational projects tackling politics.  Campus of European Alternatives  The general objectives of the Campus are to find the best paths to combat to rise of extreme right in Europe and to share and exchange practices to create transnational movements.  Citizens Rights  The Citi-Rights project examines how, when and where people in the EU can individually and collectively protect and advance rights and, where they are limited from exercising their rights, how transnational collaboration can imagine and build a future where rights are actively protected. The project is in partnership with eleven organisations across Europe and has several components: researching citizen rights in the EU, providing trainings for civil-society activists to improve their capacity to protect and extend rights, teaching about rights in schools and universities and drafting EU policy proposals.  Civil Society Forum of the Western Balkans summit series   Talk Real  Talk Real is a nomadic political talk show for the web and new media format piloted since Summer 2015.[16] The talkshow provides a space for discussions that explore topics in depth telling the stories of different social movements across Europe.

He made technical studies of several Chinese stamp issues, including overprints produced during the Revolution of 1911.Boorman, Harvard L., editor, Biographical Dictionary of the Republic of China, ‚ÄúTung Yuan-feng,‚Äù Columbia University Press, New York, 1967, III:347-349. Early life Dong was born in Ganquan in Jiangsu Province sometime in 1883 or 1884. His father was interested in local history and was an admirer of Ming loyalist philosopher Wang Fuzhi. Dong was a nephew of Qing scholar Dong Xun. Dong received a traditional education in the classics from tutors. His father died early. Dong's early scholarship includes a revision of Gantong xiaozhi (1855), a work by his uncle concerning the topography of the Dong clan‚Äôs native village. He also prepared an annotated catalog of the family library and collected samples of calligraphy. Philatelic activity Dong's interest in treaty port stamps was criticized as unpatriotic. This one is a German stamp produced in 1905 and overprinted for use in China. On a trip to Shanghai in 1908, Dong met Chen Jintao, who had been sent abroad to investigate production methods to improve the quality of Chinese postage stamps. Chen concluded the American production techniques were the best at fighting counterfeiting, a major problem in China. Chen hired two American experts to advise China‚Äôs bureau of printing and engraving, William A. Grant and Lorenzo J. Hatch. Grant had been in charge of the engraving room of the American Bank Note Company. As a result of meeting Grant, Dong developed an interest in postage stamps and in techniques to inscribe Chinese characters on them. Dong researched the history of stamp production in China, which began in 1878. In 1918, Dong published a work concerning the postage stamps used in the various treaty ports. This monograph is written in an elegant style of classical Chinese and includes hand-drawn illustrations. Dong was one of the first Chinese to study philatelic history. In 1924-1925, Dong wrote a series of articles for Shanghai's Philatelic Bulletin concerning the provisional neutrality overprints of 1912. These were stamps issued by the Qing postal service and overprinted by local authorities with the words \\"provisional neutrality\\" and \\"Republic of China\\".For examples of provisional neutrality overprints, see here. Dong described how to distinguish genuine issues from the numerous fakes that circulated at the time. The overprints could be used to illustrate the politics of the 1911 Revolution. Dong was interested in all aspects of Chinese philately. He was fond of using philately to illustrate aspects of China's history. Dong had particular interest in postage stamps that featured portraits. In 1935, Dong went to considerable lengths to obtain a Communist postage stamp that featured a portrait of Karl Marx. The stamp was issued by an authority in the Sichuan- Shaanxi border area. Assuming his interest political, the Nationalist police arrested Dong and the stamp confiscated. Although he was released after two weeks, the experience left Dong furious. After an appeal to Chiang Kai-shek, the stamp was returned. Another focus of Dong's philatelic interest was the \\"martyr's issue.\\" These stamps depicted supporters of Sun Yat-sen who had given their lives for the revolutionary cause. Dong compiled a list of 109 differences that could be used to distinguish the Beijing printing of 1932 from the Hong Kong reprint of 1937-1941. When Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese in 1937, Dong remained. He eagerly bought rare stamps held by fellow collectors who fled to the interior. He saw this as a patriotic duty and worked to prevent \\"national treasures\\" from falling into the hands of Japanese collectors. In an article published posthumously in early 1942, Dong praised the aesthetic qualities of various Japanese postage stamps as superior to that of Chinese postage stamps. The article was later reprinted by the Nanjing Regime of Wang Jingwei, which interpreted it as pro-Japanese. Dong was consulted in the production of the bilingual Ma‚Äôs Illustrated Catalog of the Stamps of China (1947). Aside from postage stamps, Dong was uninterested in foreign innovations. Even with respect to stamps, he was interested only in their Chinese aspect. He was a supporter of the Nationalists in their early years, but grew disillusioned and apolitical after 1928. Nationalists and Communists alike found fault with his interest in treaty port stamps. Dong stood apart from the various modernizing trends that swept the nation in his time. His activities as a philatelist built on the traditional role of the gentleman in Chinese society. Eccentric study and connoisseurship are both traditions with long histories in China. Dong died in Shanghai of pneumonia in November 1941. After he died, some items in his collection were sold to British collector Sir Percival David. Some of these items were sold at an auction in London in 1964.

Name  Samsin or Samshin means \\"Three Goddesses\\" in Korean, (literally, three spirits) and they appear collectively as three grandmothers. Halmoni means grandmother, a title for a venerated ancestor goddess, embodied as a wise crone goddess. When addressed with the honorary title Samsin Halmoni or just Samsin, the three goddessess are also thought of as one Samsin, the single goddess of childbirth in Korean shamanism. A mountain in South Korea is named after Samsin Halmoni, the Samsinbong, known as the Three Spirit Peak.  Worship and beliefs  Samsin Halmoni would protect every child from birth until the seventh year of age, where the child would then be protected by the deity of Seven Stars, the Ursa Major bear. Every village and every house would have its own Samsin of childbirth. Even today, the Korean people believe that the warmest part of the anbang (main living room), belongs to Samsin Halmoni and rituals and prayers to Samsin are still performed there. Samsin Halmoni was honoured at childbirth and at birthday parties with offerings of rice, soy sauce and wine, laid out in the form of a dinner. At the third and seventh day after the childbirth, the underwear of the mother would be folded and placed in the anbang Samsin area and a little altar would be set upon them, where prayers for a long and healthy life of the child would be performed. Samsin Halmoni or Samsin was also said to visit the Samsin Danji (Korean: ÏÇºÏã† Îã®ÏßÄ) dedicated to her, an earthenware pot kept in the inner wing of the house or in the warm part of the anbang. The pot was filled with rice, then covered in paper and sealed with a knot tied counterclockwise. However, some households would perform Geongung Samsin, the act of honoring Samsin, only in the mind. Samshin Halmoni was honored with Jesas at every festival or birthday celebration in the household, and also at the third, seventh and thirty- seventh day after delivery. When a woman in the household was pregnant or has given delivery, the room where the Samsin Danji was kept, would be sealed with ropes to symbolize and contain the strong power of Samshin Halmoni. After the delivery, a rope would be also hung on the outside of the house to mark the lucky event of \\"opening what has been tied\\", symbolizing the act of birth, and to ward off evil spirits that could threaten the mother and the new baby. The belief in Samsin Halmoni is strongest in Jeju Island. To conceive, a childless woman would share her Samsin rice meal with a mother who recently delivered, pray to Samsin in the anbang area or wear a cloth that has touched a coffin.  Myth  In oral tradition, Samsin Halmoni would be the 3 daughters of the virgin sky goddess who became the first mudang shamaness, who was named T'ang Kum Agassi, or Tanggum Aeggi. She descended from heaven to Earth and gave birth to the Samsin in a cave, which is a reference to bear worship and Korean shamanism. Later, after male-oriented Buddhism has entered Korea, the myth was amended with Tanggum Aeggi also giving birth to 3 sons, who became Buddhistic heaven gods. The Samsin Halmoni then created and gave birth to the first humans on Earth, becoming the mother goddesses and ancestors of all humans. In a Samsin myth, both of the main characters - the malevolent Princess of the Dragon Palace of the East Sea and the kind Princess of the Kingdom of Myeongjin - are female, underlining how the ancient myth is related to female- oriented Korean shamanism.

The native endonym is Shqiptar. The name \\"Albanians\\" (Byzantine Greek: Albanoi/Arbanitai/Albanites; Latin: Albanenses/Arbanenses) was used in medieval Greek and Latin documents that gradually entered European languages from which other similar derivative names emerged. Linguists believe that the alb part in the root word originates from an Indo-European term for a type of mountainous topography, meaning \\"hill, mountain\\", also present in Alps. Through the root word alban and its rhotacized equivalents arban, albar, and arbar, the term in Albanian became rendered as Arb√´resh√´ () for the people and Arb√´ria () for the country. Contemporary Albanian language employs a different ethnonym, with modern Albanians referring to themselves as Shqiptar√´ and to their country as Shqip√´ria. Two etymologies have been proposed for this ethnonym: one, derived the name from the Albanian word for eagle (shqiponj√´). The eagle was a common heraldic symbol for many Albanian dynasties in the Late Middle Ages and came to be a symbol of the Albanians in general, for example the flag of Skanderbeg, whose family symbol was the black double-headed eagle, as displayed on the Albanian flag.Elsie 2010, \\"Flag, Albanian\\", p. 140: \\"The eagle was a common heraldic symbol for many Albanian dynasties in the Late Middle Ages and came to be a symbol of the Albanians in general. It is also said to have been the flag of Skanderbeg...As a symbol of modern Albania, the flag began to be seen during the years of the national awakening and was in common use during the uprisings of 1909-1912. It was this flag that Ismail Qemal bey Vlora raised in Vlora on 28 November 1912 in proclaiming Albanian independence.\\" The other within scholarship connects it to the verb 'pronounce' (shqiptoj), deriving from Latin excipere. In this instance the Albanian endonym like many others would originally have been a term connoting \\"those who speak [intelligibly, the same language]\\". Attested from 14th century onward, the placename Shqip√´ria and the ethnic demonym Shqiptar√´ gradually replaced Arb√´ria and Arb√´resh√´ amongst Albanian speakers between the late 17th and early 18th centuries. That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes. As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.  Arb√´nesh/Arb√´resh (Albanian)  Arb√´n, Arb√´nesh√´, Arb√´nuer (as rendered in northern Gheg dialects) and Arb√´r, Arb√´resh√´, Arb√´ror (as rendered in southern Tosk dialects) are the old native terms denoting ancient and medieval Albanians used by Albanians.\\"Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia\\" Jeffrey E. Cole - 2011, Page 15 The Albanian language was referred to as Arb√´risht ().\\"Everyday Arberesh\\" Martin Di Maggio While the country was called Arb√´ni, definite: Arb√´nia and Arb√´ri, definite: Arb√´ria by Albanians. These terms as an endonym and as native toponyms for the country are based on the same common root alban and its rhotacized equivalents arban, albar, and arbar. The national ethnonym Albanian has derived from Albanoi,... an Illyrian tribe mentioned by Ptolemy with their centre at the city of Albanopolis,. \\"Albanian is an Indo-European language, but like modern Greek and Armenian, it does not have any other closely related living language. Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called Shqip√´ri, and the Albanians call themselves shqiptar√´. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as Arb√´risht or Arbnisht, which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name Albanoi to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as Arbanori or Albanon. It is clear that the words Arb√´resh, Arvanitika, and even Albanian and Albania are all related to the older name of the language.\\" located in modern-day central Albania, near the city of Kruj√´.Malcolm 1998, p. 29. \\"Nor is there any mystery about the origin of this name.

Kao primjer navodim sluƒçaj zadarskih Arbanasa. Da bismo shvatili Arbanase i problem njihova etnojeziƒçnog (etniƒçkog i jeziƒçnog) identiteta, potrebno je iƒái u povijest njihova doseljenja koje se≈æe u poƒçetak 18. st., tj. toƒçnije: razdoblje od prve seobe 1726., razdoblje druge seobe od 1733., pa sve do 1754. godine koja se smatra zavr≈°nom godinom njihova doseljenja. Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s podruƒçja Skadarskog jezera - Briske, ≈†estana i Livara. Bje≈æeƒái od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u podruƒçje dana≈°njih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovni≈°tva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s onda≈°njim stanovni≈°tvom zaboraviv≈°i svoj jezik. To su npr. dana≈°nji Prenƒëe, ≈†estani, ƒÜurkoviƒái, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovni≈°tva je nastojao zadr≈æati svoj etniƒçki i jeziƒçni identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilje≈æena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgraƒëe grada Zadra. Nije bilo lako, osobito u samom poƒçetku, jer nisu imali svoju crkvu, ≈°kole itd., pa je jedini naƒçin odr≈æavanja njihova identiteta i jezika bio usmenim putem. We can say that all in some way belong to a kind of ethnic category, and often more than one. As an example, I cite the case of Zadar Arbanasi. To understand the problem of the Albanians and their ethnolinguistic (ethnic and linguistic) identity, it is necessary to go into the history of their immigration that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century., etc more precisely: the period from the first migration of 1726, the period of the second migration of 1733, and until 1754, which is considered to be the final year of their immigration. All they moved from three villages from the area of Lake Scutari - Briska, ≈†estan and Livara. Fleeing from the Ottomans, plague and other troubles, the general provider Nicola Erizzo II allowed them to settle in the area of today's Arbanasa and Zemunik. One part of the population in Zemunik became assimilated with the local population, forgetting their language. These are for example, today's Prenda, ≈†estani, ƒÜurkoviƒái, Paleke etc. The second part of the population tried to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity during these 280 years. On May 10, 2006 marked the 280th anniversary of their arrival in the suburb of Zadar. It was not easy, especially in the beginning, because they did not have their own church, school, etc., and is the only way to maintain their identity and language was verbally.\\" In modern South Slavic languages the term is Albanac.Mirdita, Zef (1969). \\"Iliri i etnogeneza Albanaca\\".

Arvanites  Albanians in the 19th century Arvanitis (ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ), plural: Arvanites (ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒµœÇ); is a term that was historically used amongst the wider Greek-speaking population to describe an Albanian speaker regardless of their religious affiliations until the interwar period, alongside with Alvanoi (ŒëŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒøŒØ). The name was established in Greek language from the original ethnonym Alvanitis (ŒÜŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ), which in return derived from Alvanos (ŒÜŒªŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ). The name appears as the ethnonym of Albanians in medieval Byzantine sources, originally as \\"Arbanitai\\",Malcolm, Noel. \\"Kosovo, a short history\\". London: Macmillan, 1998, p. 29 \\"The name used in all these references is, allowing for linguistic variations, the same: 'Albanenses' or 'Arbanenses' in Latin, 'Albanoi' or 'Arbanitai' in Byzantine Greek. (The last of these, with an internal switching of consonants, gave rise to the Turkish form 'Arnavud', from which 'Arnaut' was later derived.)\\" \\"Their traditional designation, based on a root *alban- and its rhotacized variants *arban-, *albar-, and *arbar-, appears from the eleventh century onwards in Byzantine chronicles (Albanoi, Arbanitai, Arbanites), and from the fourteenth century onwards in Latin and other Western documents (Albanenses, Arbanenses).\\" (in Greek language the letter 'b' is pronounced as 'v'; hence \\"Arvanitai\\") and was rendered in modern Greek as \\"Arvanites\\".2006, Carl Waldman, Catherine Mason; \\"Encyclopedia of European Peoples\\" - Volume 2 - Page 38 Today, the term Arvanites is used by Greeks to refer to descendants of Albanians or Arb√´resh√´ that migrated to southern Greece during the medieval era and who currently self identify as Greeks, as a result of assimilation.. \\"The term \\"Arvanite\\" is the medieval equivalent of \\"Albanian.\\" it is retained today for the descendants of the Albanian tribes that migrated to the Greek lands during a period covering two centuries, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth.\\". \\"Among Greeks, the term \\"Alvanitis\\"‚Äîor \\"Arvanitis\\"‚Äîmeans a Christian of Albanian ancestry, one who speaks both Greek and Albanian, but possesses Greek \\"consciousness.\\" Numerous \\"Arvanites\\" live in Greece today, although the ability to speak both languages is shrinking as the differences (due to technology and information access and vastly different economic bases) between Greece and Albania increase. The Greek communities of Elefsis, Marousi, Koropi, Keratea, and Markopoulo (all in the Attikan peninsula) once held significant Arvanite communities. \\"Arvanitis\\" is not necessarily a pejorative term; a recent Pan Hellenic socialist foreign minister spoke both Albanian and Greek (but not English). A former Greek foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, was an \\"Arvanite\\" from Elefsis.\\" Sometimes its variant Alvanites may be used instead. In the region of Epirus within Greece today, the term Arvanitis is still used for an Albanian speaker regardless of their citizenship and religion.. footnote. 9. \\"Until the Interwar period Arvanitis (plural Arvanitƒìs) was the term used by Greek speakers to describe an Albanian speaker regardless of his/hers religious background. In official language of that time the term Alvanos was used instead. The term Arvanitis coined for an Albanian speaker independently of religion and citizenship survives until today in Epirus (see Lambros Baltsiotis and L√©onidas Embirikos, \\"De la formation d‚Äôun ethnonyme. Le terme Arvanitis et son evolution dans l‚Äô√âtat hell√©nique\\", in G. Grivaud-S. Petmezas (eds.), Byzantina et Moderna, Alexandreia, Athens, 2006, pp. 417-448.\\" While the term Arvanitika (ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒπŒ∫Œ±) is used within Greece for all varieties of the Albanian language spoken there, whereas within Western academia the term is used for the Albanian language spoken in Southern Greece.. \\"Botsi's chapter on Arvanitika also gives much useful information but contains some unfortunate errors. The northern dialect of Albanian is Geg, not Gjeg (47 et passim), and the formulation \\"... Albanian does not constitute the direct descendent of an (one?) Indo-European language ...\\" is flat out wrong. While it is true that we are not certain which lndo-European language Albanian is directly descended from, it is as much the descendent of a single language as Greek or French. The claim that Greek and Latin are \\"at the origin of Albanian polygensis\\" (48) is mistaken. To be sure, Albanian was heavily influenced by Latin (much less by Greek, especially in the north), but the core grammar and vocabulary represent a distinct and different branch of Indo-European. The primary shape of the root alban- in deriving the various forms of the relevant name is not clearly presented and the forms Shqip√´ria (Geg Shqipnia) and Shqip(√´)tar are misspelled. The use of Arvanitika to cover all the Albanian-speakers of Greece no doubt reflects popular Greek usage, but in the North American academic community, this label is restricted to those dialects of Greece for which the term of self-ascription is Arb√´risht rather than Shqip. This latter term, which apparently came into use in the 15th century and is derived from an adverb meaning ‚Äò[speak] clearly,‚Äô is used by the √áams as well as in the villages near Florina, Konitsa, in Thrace and, we can add, in Mandres near Kilkis (an enclave that arrived from Mandrica in what is now Bulgaria as a result of the Balkan Wars, although the dialect is now moribund or dead [Eric Hamp, p.c., see Hamp 1965 for more data]). From a strictly dialectological point of view, what we can call Arvanitika proper (Southern Arvanitika in Botsi's terms) represents the southernmost extension of the Albanian dialect continuum with a consistent and gradual development of isoglosses. Arb√´resh, on the other hand, shows a diversity of Tosk dialects, the ancestors of whose speakers must have come from all along the western part of the Northern Tosk- Lab-√áam-Arvanitika continuum (Eric Hamp, p.c.). While Arvanitika proper broke off directly from southern cam, the non-cam dialects of Epirus., Macedonia and Thrace are all the results of later northern Tosk migrations.\\". \\"It is not too widely known that a majority of villages in the Athens area of Greece are inhabited by people of Albanian rather than Greek ethnic origin. These people are not recent immigrants, but the descendants of Albanians who entered the country at various times, for the most part between the 11th and 15th centuries. These Greek Albanians long retained a clearly separate ethnic identity, apparently, but gradually this identity has been eroded. Today they refer to themselves not as Albanians but as Arvanites, and call the language they speak not Albanian but Arvanitika. They are also very concerned to explain to outsiders that they are not only Arvanites but Greeks as well (see Trudgill and Tzavaras, forthcoming). The result of this development is that the main, perhaps only identifying characteristic of the Greek Albanians is now their language.\\" Alongside these ethnonyms the term Arvanitia (ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒπœÑŒπŒ¨) for the country has also been used by Greek society in folklore, sayings, riddles, dances and toponyms.. \\"Por edhe llojet e tjera folklorike, si p.sh. fjal√´t e urta, goj√´dh√´nat, gj√´agj√´zat, vallet dhe toponimet na japin vetem trajtat ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒπœÑŒπŒ¨, Œ±œÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ (arvanit, Arb√´ri, arvanit) [But other kinds of folklore, such as proverbs, legends, riddles, dances and toponyms which give us only the forms ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒπœÑŒπŒ¨, Œ±œÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ (arvanit, Arber, arvanit)].\\" For example, some Greek writers used the term Arvanitia alongside the older Greek term Eprius for parts or all of contemporary Albania and modern Epirus in Greece until the 19th century.. \\"During the period of the Ottoman domination the geographic entity of Epirus was a matter of great study for the scholars and the geographers of the time. The way the subject was dealt with was mainly a matter of the ideological perspective of each scholar and of his academic and cultural background, a factor that differentiates both them and the definitions that each one gives. It can be observed that scholars who were influenced by the Ancient Greeks favoured an approach based on Ptolemy's theory that the boundaries of Epirus are the Akrokeravnia mountain range, while those inclined to Byzantine opinions added areas of what was once New Epirus such as Avlona and Dyrrachio. All of them, though, were obliged to determine the differences between the ancient term of Epirus and the new term Arvanitia or Albania, the area of which was similarly disputed. We will confine ourselves to the references of a few scholars of the period of Ottoman domination, particularly those that belong chronologically near the era we are studying. For A. Psalida, \\"Albania, (former Illyricon and Epirus) is bordered to the east by the lower parts of Macedonia and Thessaly, to the north by Bosnan and Serbia, to the west by the Ionian Sea and to the south by the Gulf of Amvrakia\\", a perception without any ethnological basis which reflects the literature of the period. The writer uses the word Albania, the scholars‚Äô way of expressing the older Greek term Arvanitia, to refer to Epirus. \\"Albania consists of two toparchies or kingdoms, one of Epirus and one of Illyricon\\", the writer continues. With this revision he places the river Aoos as a border between Epirus and Illyricon - Ano Arvanitia (upper Arvanitia), a notion which his student Kosmas the Thesprotian also adopts to define Albania. \\"Albania to the west is bordered by the Adriatic Sea, to the east by the western parts of Macedonia, to the north by Bosnan, Dalmatia and Montenegro and to the south by Epirus, from which it is divided by the river Viosa or Vousa\\". In these descriptions it is obvious that Avlona is also included inside the borders of Epirus, although the ancient treatise clearly places it in Macedonia (Ptolemy). A few years later, at the time of the Greek revolution, Psalidas refutes, for obvious reasons, the term Arvanitia and comments: \\"Epirus is wrongly referred to as Arvanitia, since no one there knows how to speak Arvanitika (Albanian)\\". The Bishop of Athens, Meletios, in the old and new Geography (1728) defines two terms, Arvanitia which constitutes the western part of Macedonia, and the Old Epirus. The two regions are divided by the river Kelidno, which the writer identifies as a river in the area of Liapouria. We observe that this opinion coincides with Ptolemy‚Äôs scheme (Œì‚Ä≤, 12, 4.) to which the latest term, Arvanitia, is now added. As a subdivision of Arvanitia, Meletios newly introduces the old- Byzantine term of New Epirus in which he includes the lands between Hemmara and Dirrachio. In \\"Modern Geography\\", the Dimitries restore the boundary to Akrokeravnia mountain, which was the ancient Greeks line of demarcation for the lands of the area. They place the lower part of Arvanitia (Kato Arvanitia) in western Macedonia. All the rest of the geographical or ethnological approaches of the 18th and 19th century are theoretical texts that duplicate more or less the views mentioned above. It can be said that in general there is a tendency to identify the political transformations that occur over time with the determination of geographical boundaries and names.\\"  Arnaut/Arnavut  Arnaut smoking in Cairo ‚Äî Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me 1865 Arnaut (ÿßÿ±ŸÜÿßŸàÿØ), Arvanid (ÿßÿ±ŸàÿßŸÜŸäÿØ), Arnavud (ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸàŸàÿØ), plural: Arnavudlar (ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸàŸàÿØŸÑÿßÿ±): modern Turkish: Arnavut, plural: Arnavutlar; are ethnoyms used mainly by Ottoman and contemporary Turks for Albanians with Arnavut√ßa being the name of the Albanian language.\\"Arnavudca\\".

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries due to socio-political disturbances by some Albanians in the Balkans the term was used as an ethnic marker for Albanians in addition to the usual millet religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records. While the term used in Ottoman sources for the country was Arnavudluk (ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸàŸàÿØŸÑŸÇ) for areas such as Albania, Western Macedonia, Southern Serbia, Kosovo, parts of northern Greece and southern Montenegro.. \\"This Albanian participation in brigandage is easier to track than for many other social groups in Ottoman lands, because Albanian (Arnavud) was one of the relatively few ethnic markers regularly added to the usual religious (Muslim-Zimmi) tags used to identify people in state records.

In comparison with ‚ÄòSerbs‚Äô, who were not a meaningful category to the Ottoman state, its records refer to ‚ÄòAlbanians‚Äô more frequently than to many other cultural or linguistic groups. The term ‚ÄòArnavud‚Äô was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as ‚ÄòArnavudluk‚Äô, and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters ‚Äî a group, in short, difficult to control. Other peoples, such as Georgians, Ahkhaz, Circassians, Tatars, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs who were frequently identified by their ethnicity, shared similar cultural traits.\\". \\"Anscombe (ibid., 107 n. 3) notes that Ottoman \\"Albania\\" or Arnavudluk... included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia\\"; see also El2. s.v. \\"Arnawutluk. 6.

At the same time Albanian regions within the empire were referred to as Arnavudluk (Albania) and the geographic terms Gegalƒ±k (Ghegland) and Toskalƒ±k (Toskland) were also used in government documents. In modern Turkish Arnavutluk refers only to the Republic of Albania.. Historically as an exonym the Turkish term Arnaut has also been used for instance by some Western Europeans as a synonym for Albanians that were employed as soldiers in the Ottoman army.. \\"And a further complication is introduced by the term \\"Arnaut\\", which could he used as a synonym for \\"Albanian\\", hut tended to suggest those Albanians (in the ethnic-linguistic sense) who acted as soldiers for the Ottomans ‚Äî though these, it should be noted, included Catholic Albanians as well as Muslim ones. (When early reports refer to the local Ottoman forces, such as the force led by Mahmut Begolli [Mehmet Beyoƒülu], pasha of Peja, they usually state that they consisted largely of Arnauts. Those Serb historians who claim that the terms Arnaut and Albanian did not mean ethnic Albanians, when applied to the supporters of Piccolomini, seem to have no difficulty in accepting that they did have that meaning, when applied to those fighting against him.)\\" The term ArnƒÅ‚Äô≈´·π≠ (ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ±ŸÜÿßÿ§Ÿàÿ∑) also entered the Arabic language as an exonym for Albanian communities that settled in the Levant during the Ottoman era onward, especially for those residing in Syria. The term Arnaut (–ê—Ä–Ω–∞—É—Ç), plural: Arnauti (–ê—Ä–Ω–∞—É—Ç–∏) has also been borrowed into Balkan south Slavic languages like Bulgarian and within Serbian the word has also acquired pejorative connotations regarding Albanians.. \\"Der urspr√ºngliche Name ŒÜŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ (abgeleitet von ŒÜŒªŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ) wurde im Neugriechischen zu ŒÜœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ‚Ä¶ In t√ºrkischer Vermittlung erfuhr die Silbe -van- eine Metathese zu -nav-, so dass die t√ºrkische Form des Namens f√ºr die Albaner arnavut bzw. arnaut Lautet.

Albanese  Albanese and Albanesi is an Italian surname meaning \\"Albanian\\", in reference to the Arb√´resh√´ people (Italo-Albanians) of southern Italy. Among people who have the surname it is common in southern Italy and rare elsewhere in the country. \\"Alban√©se, -i {comune nel Sud, raro altrove}: dall'etnico Alban√©se o, nel Sud, 'appartenente alle colonie albanesi' (in Abruzzo, Puglie, Campania, Calabria e Sicilia).\\" The term Albanesi was used for some Balkan troops recruited (mid 18th - early 19th centuries) by the Kingdom of Naples that indicated their general origins (without implying ethnic connotations) or fighting style, due to the reputation Albanians held of serving as mercenaries in Ottoman armies. \\"In the eighty odd years during which Naples employed light infantry from the Balkans, the troops of the regiment and its successors were known popularly under three names... the seemingly national names of Greci, Albanesi, and Macedoni. These names did not, however, have their later ethnic connotations but were instead stylized terms that described the soldiers‚Äô general origins or mode of fighting... The term Albanesi was used because that nation had achieved fame for its style of fighting as mercenaries of the Ottoman Empire. Muslim Albanians had become a mainstay of the sultan‚Äôs armies and were given the nickname \\"the Swiss of the Near East‚Äù by Europeans.\\" Epirot Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi, Epirotarum principis (\\"History of the life and deeds of Scanderbeg, Prince of the Epirots\\") by Marin Barleti, 1508. By the Late Middle Ages, during the period of Humanism and the European Renaissance, the terms epirot, Epir and gjuh√´ epirote (Latin: epirota, Epirus, lingua epirotica) were preferred in the intellectual, literary and clerical circles of the time, used as synonyms for arb√´n, Arb√´n, Dheu i Arb√´nit, Arb√´n√≠/r√≠, ab√´nuer/arb√´ror, i arb√´nesh/arb√´resh, and later, respectively for shqiptar, Shqipni/Shqip√´ri, (lingua) shqipe. Subsequently, this linguistic-historical ethnic association was faithfully followed also by the Albanian intellectuals and Catholic clerics during the Middle Ages. On a letter sent to the Prince of Taranto Giovanni Orsini in 1460, the Albanian Lord Skanderbeg wrote: ‚ÄúSe le nostre cronache non mentono, noi ci chiamiamo Epiroti‚Äù (\\"If our chronicles don't lie, we call ourselves Epiroti\\"). Published in Rome in 1635 by the Albanian bishop and writer Frang Bardhi, the first dictionary of the Albanian language was titled: Dictionarium latino-epiroticum (\\"Latin-Epirotan [Albanian] dictionary\\").  Shqiptar  Albanian minority in Romania from 1889. Shqip(√´)tar and Shqyptar (in northern Albanian dialects) is the contemporary endonym used by Albanians for themselves while Shqip√´ria and Shqypnia/Shqipnia are native toponyms used by Albanians to name their country. All terms share the same Albanian root shqipoj that is derived from the Latin excipere with both terms carrying the meaning of \\"to speak clearly, to understand\\". While the Albanian public favours the explanation that the self-ethnonym is derived from the Albanian word for eagle shqipe that is displayed on the national Albanian flag.. \\"Prior to the emergence of the modern self-ethnonym Shqiptar√´ in the mid-16th century (for the first time it was recorded in 1555 by the Catholic Gheg, Gjon Buzuku, in his missal), North Albanians (Ghegs) referred to themselves as Arb√´n, and South Albanians (Tosks) Arb√´r. Hence, the self-ethnonym Arb√´resh√´ of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for ‚ÄòAlbanians,‚Äô which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (Arbanasi), Ottoman (Arnaut), Romanian (ArbƒÉnas), and Aromanian (Arbine≈ü). It is clear that scholars and Albanians themselves agree that they do not agree on any single etymology of the ethnonym ‚ÄòAlbanian.‚Äô A similar predicament is faced by the self-ethnonym Shqiptar√´. The most popular scholarly explanation is that it was formed by analogy to ‚ÄòSlavs‚Äô (*Slovene), believed to be derived from slovo (‚Äòword‚Äô), and by extension, from *sluti (‚Äòto speak clearly.‚Äô) The last explanation semantically contrasts with Slavic Niemiec (‚Äòmute,‚Äô‚Äòstammering,‚Äô‚Äòbabbling‚Äô), and Greek ‚Äòbarbarian‚Äô (from barbaros ‚Äòthose who stammer, babble‚Äô). Hence, Shqiptar√´ could be derived from Albanian shqipoi (from Latin excipere) for ‚Äòto speak clearly, to understand.‚Äô The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from shqipe (‚Äòeagle‚Äô) found on the Albanian national flag.\\" The words Shqip√´ri and Shqiptar are attested from 14th century onward, but it was only at the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries that the placename Shqip√´ria and the ethnic demonym Shqiptar√´ gradually replaced Arb√´ria and Arb√´resh√´ amongst Albanian speakers.. \\"The Albanians of today call themselves shqiptar√´, their country Shqip√´ri, and their language shqipe. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them albanesi (Italian), Albaner (German), Albanians (English), Alvanos (Greek), and Arbanasi (old Serbian), the country Albania, Albanie, Albanien, Alvania, and Albanija, and the language Albanese, Albanisch, Albanian, Alvaniki, and Arbanashki respectively. All these words are derived from the name Albanoi of an Illyrian tribe and their center Albanopolis, noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. Alban could he a plural of alb- arb-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (√áABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves arb√´nesh, arb√´resh, the country Arb√´ni, Arb√´ri, and the language arb√´neshe, arb√´reshe. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by shqiptar√´, Shqip√´ri and shqipe. The primary root is the adverb shqip, meaning \\"clearly, intelligibly\\". There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun Deutsche, \\"the Germans\\" and \\"the German language\\" (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and Shqipni/Shqip√´ri is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of Arb√´ni, Arb√´ri. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this.\\" Skipetar is a historical rendering or exonym of the term Shqiptar by some Western European authors in use from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. The term ≈†iptar (–®–∏–ø—Ç–∞—Ä), plural: ≈†iptari (–®–∏–ø—Ç–∞—Ä–∏) and also ≈†iftari (–®–∏—Ñ—Ç–∞—Ä–∏) is a derivation used by Balkan Slavic peoples and former states like Yugoslavia which Albanians consider derogatory due to its negative connotations preferring Albanci instead.. \\"emri etnik a nacional e shqiptar√´ve, p√´rkund√´r trajt√´s s√´ drejt√´ sllave Albanci, tash del t√´ shqiptohet si ≈†iptari e ≈†ipci me nj√´ konotacion p√´rbuz√´s negativ, ashtu si√ß √´sht√´ p√´rdorur n√´ krye t√´ her√´s te serb√´t edhe n√´ koh√´n e Jugosllavis√´ s√´ Vjet√´r bashk√´ dhe me form√´n ≈†iftari e Arnauti me po t√´ nj√´tat konotacione pejorative. [ethnic name or the national one of Albanians, despite the right Slavic term Albanci, now appears to be pronounced as ≈†iptari of ≈†ipci with a connotation that is contemptuously negative, as it is used in the very beginning of the Serbs era at the time of the old Yugoslavia together and the form ≈†iftari and Arnauti which have the same pejorative connotations.]\\". \\"There is similar terminological confusion over the name for the inhabitants of the region. After 1945, in pursuit of a policy of national equality, the Communist Party designated the Albanian community as ‚Äò≈†iptari‚Äô (Shqiptare, in Albanian), the term used by Albanians themselves to mark the ethnic identity of any member of the Albanian nation, whether living in Albania or elsewhere.‚Ä¶ However, with the increased territorial autonomy of Kosovo in the late 1960s, the Albanian leadership requested that the term ‚ÄòAlbanians‚Äô be used instead‚Äîthus stressing national, rather than ethnic, self-identification of the Kosovar population. The term ‚ÄòAlbanians‚Äô was accepted and included in the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. In the process, however, the Serbian version of the Albanian term for ethnic Albanians‚Äî‚Äò≈†iptari‚Äô‚Äîhad acquired an openly pejorative flavor, implying cultural and racial inferiority. Nowadays, even though in the documents of post- socialist Serbia the term ‚ÄòAlbanians‚Äô is accepted as official, many state and opposition party leaders use the term ‚Äò≈†iptari‚Äô indiscriminately in an effort to relegate the Kosovo Albanians to the status of one among many minority groups in Serbia. Thus the quarrel over the terms used to identify the region and its inhabitants has acquired a powerful emotional and political significance for both communities.. \\"Because of their allegedly rampant aggression and concerted attempts to destroy national integrity, Albanians in Macedonia are stigmatized with the pejorative term ≈†iptar (singular)/≈†iptari (plural) as an ethic Other. Especially important for the purposes of this paper, as I show below, is the ambivalent character of the stereotype ≈†iptar/i‚Äîafter all, as Bhabha ([1994] 2004:95) reminds us \\"the stereotype [is] an ambivalent mode of knowledge and power,\\" a \\"contradictory mode of representation, as anxious as it is assertive\\" (2004:100). In particular, the stereotype declares Albanians to be utterly incapable of participating in political and social life as Macedonian nationals who are committed to respecting and upholding state laws, and the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Macedonia. In this sense, they are allegedly intrinsically \\"inferior\\"‚Äî\\"stupid,\\" \\"dirty,\\" \\"smelly,\\" \\"uncultured,\\" \\"backward,\\" and so on. By the same token, however, and in the context of an ethnic-chauvinist and masculinist ideology (which I discuss in the next section), the stereotype also declares Albanians to be aggressive and capable of violating the territorial integrity of the Macedonian state and the moral integrity of Macedonian women. In this sense then, the stereotype invests Albanians with an excessive, disorderly energy that cannot be regulated and, hence, is dangerous (also see Lambevski 1997; for an analysis of the production and transgression of stereotypes, see Neofotistos 2004)..

Biography =Appointment to Transylvania= Following the October 1767 resignation of Dionisije Novakoviƒá as administrator of the Transylvania diocese, several proposals for a successor emerged. Maria Theresa named Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá to the office a year later. However, he did not have a chance to take up the position, as he became Metropolitan of Karlovci after a month. In December 1769, ƒêorƒëeviƒá called a church congress for the Serbs, and this meeting elected Kiriloviƒá, the former vicar of Novakoviƒá in the Eparchy of Buda, as the new bishop of Transylvania. In January 1770, the empress annulled the election on the basis that a Serbian congress could not elect a bishop for the Romanians of Transylvania, but at the same time named Kiriloviƒá the new bishop herself.PƒÉcurariu, p. 19 The same restrictions placed on Novakoviƒá were extended to the activity of Kiriloviƒá, with two additions. First, he was barred from interacting with his priests, particularly through canonical visits, except as authorized by the provincial government. Second, he was not to allow the presence of priests ordained outside Transylvania (i.e., in Moldavia and Wallachia), and was to denounce any he found. Also in 1770, the empress decided that all liturgical books for the Orthodox peoples of the Habsburg Monarchy were to be printing in Vienna, in an effort directed against the importation of texts from Moldavia and Wallachia. =Activity in Sibiu= Unlike Novakoviƒá, who was merely locum tenens, Kiriloviƒá had the status of a regular bishop. Furthermore, his residence was fixed at Sibiu: the provincial government was located there, and he could be more easily supervised. Consecrated at Karlovci in May 1770, he was enthroned at Sibiu two months later. He lived in a rented house and had no church, but with the help of the authorities, placed the local Greek and Aromanian Orthodox under his jurisdiction. These individuals had their own church, probably on the site of the present cathedral. According to a 1772 census, the diocese numbered 558,076 members.PƒÉcurariu, p. 20 During his time in office, Sofronije met with difficulties from the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. For instance, in 1772, the Orthodox church in Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ was seized with the help of the army, handed over to the Greek-Catholics and the parish priest arrested. Such incidents, combined with the restrictions and lack of a residence, led the bishop to request transfer to a Serbian diocese in September 1773. As successor, he recommended his secretary and interpreter, Dimitrie Eustatievici. Moreover, the local authorities had reported him to Vienna for impeding Greek-Catholic efforts at conversion. =Later years= In August 1774, the empress named Kiriloviƒá bishop of Buda, an act that discontented the Serbs, whose bishops had to be elected by the church congress. He served at Buda until 1781, when this body, following canon law, elected him Bishop of Timi»ôoara. Meanwhile, although he had left Transylvania, he was still responsible for ordaining its priests. These were recommended to him by archpriest Ioan Popovici of Hondol, who was vicar of the vacant see. Only in 1784, after ten years, did a new bishop arrive; in the interim, Greek-Catholic activity measurably increased under Bishop Grigore Maior. Sofronije ordained a number of Romanian priests at Buda and Timi»ôoara; a number of their names are present in a document of 1805. The bishop died in 1786 and was buried in the Timi»ôoara Serbian Cathedral.PƒÉcurariu, p. 21 Notes References *Mircea PƒÉcurariu, CƒÉrturari sibieni de altƒÉdatƒÉ.

Retrieved 30 November 2016 In 1951, Frankie Ervin was signed as a singer by Mercury Records, and released the single \\"High School Baby\\" / \\"Got My Shipyard Job Back Again,\\" with Maxwell Davis' band and Jesse Ervin on guitar. The following year, he recorded as featured vocalist with Oscar Moore's Combo, and in 1953 (credited as Frank Evans) recorded with Preston Love's band for Federal Records. Later in the year he recorded \\"Dragnet Blues\\" as lead singer with Johnny Moore's Three Blazers, on the Bihari brothers' Modern label. The record company faced legal action from Jack Webb of the Dragnet radio and TV show, for unauthorized use of part of the show's theme, but the case was resolved and the record sold well, reaching number 8 on the Billboard R&B; chart. The Bihari brothers persuaded Ervin to leave Johnny Moore's group and record solo, again with Maxwell Davis' orchestra, but his records were not successful and he returned to touring with the Three Blazers. In early 1955, he recorded \\"Johnny Ace's Last Letter\\" with the group. The song purported to be a letter from singer Johnny Ace explaining why he had killed himself; it reached number 15 on the R&B; chart. Later in the year, Ervin recorded several Christmas songs with the Blazers, including \\"Christmas Eve Baby\\". He also recorded under the name Frankie Day for the Caddy label set up by radio DJ Dick Hugg. In early 1958, record producer George Motola persuaded Ervin to record the song \\"You Cheated\\", which had been first recorded by a white vocal group, The Slades. Ervin was backed by an impromptu studio vocal group comprising Jesse Belvin, Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson, Tommy \\"Buster\\" Williams and \\"Handsome\\" Mel Williams, and musicians including guitarist Ren√© Hall. Mitch Rosalsky, \\"Shields (Los Angeles)\\", Encyclopedia of Rhythm & Blues and Doo-Wop Vocal Groups, Scarecrow Press, 2002, p.515 Credited to The Shields - an otherwise non-existent group - and first issued on the Tender label before being reissued by Dot Records, the record reached number 12 on the pop chart later that year, and number 11 on the R&B; chart. Ervin toured and appeared on national TV to promote the record, with different singers as his backing vocalists, but the original recording group reconvened in the studio to record less successful follow-ups, including \\"Nature Boy\\". Tom Simon, \\"The Shields\\", 2011. Retrieved 30 November 2016 Ervin continued to record occasionally under his own name for small labels in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but with little success. He left the music business in the 1960s, before re-emerging in 1982 with San Francisco band Mitch Woods and his Rocket 88. Following the release of a compilation album of his 1950s material, Dragnet Blues, in 1987, he returned to the recording studio in 1988, to record in Los Angeles with Ernie Freeman's and Charles Brown's bands. He continued to perform from then on, mainly in the San Francisco area. A compilation of his recordings from the 1950s to the 1990s, You Cheated, You Lied, was released on his own label, Punchline, in 1996. He died in San Francisco in 2009, aged 82.

It protects a mountainous region of cerrado. The park contains an abandoned village, once home to workers in a textile factory, which is now a tourist attraction. Location The Biribiri State Park is in the municipality of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, from the municipal seat and from the state capital of Belo Horizonte. It has an area of . The park is accessed via a dirt road, but it is maintained well and can be used by cars. The entrance is from the center of Diamantina. The park is in the Serra do Espinha√ßo, a range with quartz rocks in the Jequitinhonha River basin. Altitudes range from in the north to in the south. The park still has traces of gold and diamond exploration. There are archaeological sites with rock inscriptions, but their locations are not marked. Environment The climate is tropical, with annual average temperature of about . The wettest month is December. Vegetation includes cerrado, gallery forest and rocky fields. There are fragments of cerrad√£o in the north, and areas of dense forest on the slopes of streams and rivers. Flora include the Vellozia squamata, Caryocar brasiliense, jacarand√°, pau-santo, Campomanesia pubescens, Hancornia speciosa and candeia, as well as many types of evergreens, orchids and bromeliads. Fauna include maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), cougar (Puma concolor) and southern crested caracara (Caracara plancus). Other species include the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris), lesser nothura (Nothura minor), helmeted manakin (Antilophia galeata) and hyacinth visorbearer (Augastes scutatus). History The Biribiri State Park was created by decree 39.909 of 22 September 1998. The park is named after the Fazenda Biribiri, which covered most of its area. It is administered by the State Institute of Forestry (IEF). The objectives are to preserve the area due to its environmental and cultural importance. The park became part of the Espinha√ßo Mosaic of conservation units, created in 2010. Infrastructure is minimal. There is one caretaker who works in a shack at the park entrance, and there is a house at one of the highest points used as a lookout at periods of high fire risk. In April 2013, the Public Ministry and Justice department of Minas Gerais charged that the State Forestry Institute had been failing to comply with environmental legislation. There were serious problems such as lack of a management plan, physical structures and personnel, and land tenure issues with the ecological stations of Mata do Acau√£ and Mata dos Ausentes and the state parks of Biribiri, Alto Cariri, Rio Preto and Serra Negra. Attractions The Cachoeira do Sentinela, a waterfall, is about from the entrance. Visitors may bathe in the pool. Further on is the Cachoeira dos Cristais. This waterfall is from the entrance, and may be reached by car. The Caminho dos Escravos (Slave Trail) is a trail that passes through the interior of the park. Other attractions are the √Ågua Limpa and Estudante pools, and the 4 hour waterfall trail. As of 2016 the park was open every day including holidays, and admission was free. Visitors may use bicycles on the trails that lead to the waterfalls. The months from May to July are cold, and suitable for hiking. The historical village of Biribiri Vila de Biribiri The Estamparia SA, a textile factory, was created in the interior of what is now the park in 1876 by the Bishop of Diamantina, Jo√£o Ant√¥nio dos Santos. This was one of the first and most important textile factories in the state. The workers lived in a small town in the center of a valley, which held a warehouse, school and church. The church bell was made in the factory, and the clock was donated by the Portuguese royal family. The Biribiri River, which runs through the park, powered the hydroelectric turbines that delivered electricity to the factory and the village. The factory had 1,200 workers. It closed in 1976, and the village was emptied. The village is still owned by Estamparia SA, and tourists can rent the houses. There are two restaurants in the village.

He was an anti-Manchu rebel active at the time of the 1911 Revolution. He later became a left-wing member of the Nationalist Party, or KMT, and was executed as a Communist partisan in 1927.Boorman, Harvard L., editor, Biographical Dictionary of the Republic of China, ‚ÄúChan Ta-pei‚Äù, Columbia University Press, New York, 1967, pp. I:9-11. Early life Zhan was born in Qizhun in Hubei Province in 1888. Zhan's family had a scholarly background. Even as a boy, Zhan was recognized for his memory and literary talent. In the examination to enter middle school, he scored first place of 20,000 applicants. He was also the youngest of all the applicants. Nonetheless, he was expelled from the school soon after enrolling, possibly due to his rebellious attitude. Career as revolutionary A schoolmate recommended Zhan to be a member of the Tongmenghui, a revolutionary party headed by Sun Yat-sen. Zhan edited journals and attempted to convert military officers in Hubei to the revolutionary cause. When the railways were nationalized in 1911, many investors protested. As a leftist, Zhan supported nationalization in principle, but class warfare and leftist principles did not stop Zhan from siding with the bourgeois investors against the government. In an article entitled ‚ÄúRebellion is the cure for China,‚Äù he proclaimed the Manchu government illegitimate. He was arrested and sentenced to eighteen months in prison. The sentence gave him nationwide public attention and made him a hero of the revolutionary movement. He was freed in October upon the outbreak of the Revolution of 1911. Once freed, Zhan was selected leader by a group of revolutionaries in Hankou, capital of Hubei and now part of Wuhan. Zhan then ordered the execution of the Qing commander of the Hankou garrison. After the 1913 parliamentary election, the Tongmenghui merged with several smaller parties to form the KMT. Zhan was slated to be speaker of the Hubei provincial assembly. When KMT leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated in March 1913, the KMT was banned and Zhan became a revolutionary plotter once more. He was arrested in Shanghai in 1915 and imprisoned at the International Settlement. He was released when President Yuan Shikai died in 1916. In 1920, Zhan went to Guangzhou and became a propaganda officer in Sun Yat-sen‚Äôs southern government. He was a delegate to the First National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or reorganized KMT, in January 1924. After Sun died in 1925, Zhan sided with KMT leader Wang Jingwei. Wang was allied with the Chinese Communist Party, which was directed by Soviet adviser Mikhail Borodin. Zhan became an alternate member of the KMT executive committee in January 1926. In May 1926, KMT military commander Chiang Kai-shek forced Wang to take a family vacation to Europe. Advancing northward, KMT forces captured Wuhan in October and Nanchang in November. In December, left-wing leaders began to meet in Wuhan while a rival anti- Communist faction formed at Chiang's military headquarters in Nanchang. Zhan served as finance commissioner for the Wuhan faction. Wang returned from Europe in April 1927 to lead the Wuhan faction.Wang Ke-wen, Modern China: An encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism, 1998, \\"Nanjing-Wuhan split,\\" p. 225. In March 1927, the KMT captured both Shanghai and Nanjing. In April, Chiang and other right-wing KMT leaders set up a National Government in Nanjing and ordered a purge of Communists. Zhan‚Äôs name was on the list of those to be purged. A Communist uprising that began on August 1 spurred reconciliation between the KMT's rival factions. Wang and the other KMT leftists abandoned Wuhan for Nanjing in September. Meanwhile, Zhan remained in his native province with the Communists. He was arrested in late 1927 by soldiers under the command of Hu Zongduo and executed. Zhan was survived by his wife, by his son Zhan Shihua, and by his daughter Zhan Zhifang.

F. M. ( or , 4 October 1804 ‚Äì 17 March 1866) was an Italian priest and the second Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong. Biography Feliciani was born in Marano, Italy in 1804. He joined the Order of the Friars Minor in 1823 and was then sent to Macau in 1833 as an assistance to the procurator. Afterwards, he was sent to Shanxi, China, as a missionary. In 1838, he was recalled to Macau again to assist the procurator and operate a seminary for seminarians from Shanxi. In March 1842, he and Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, along with other priests and seminarians, were banished from Macau and arrived at Hong Kong. After the death of Joset in August 1842, Feliciani was appointed by the Holy See as the pro-Prefect Apostolic on 19 March 1843, which was intended to be a temporary position. He led the church out of the many troubles caused by the rather unsettled and confused situation of Hong Kong, and diligently coordinated the mission work in China. To sustain the financial position of the Prefecture, he had made substantial investment in real estates, including a large area in Wanchai such as the present St. Francis Street and Star Street. On repeated requests from Feliciani himself, he was relieved from the duty of pro-Prefect in Oct 1847 by the Holy See, and handed the responsibility of the prefecture to Bishop Augustin Forcade, who was then the Vicar Apostolic of Ryukyu. However, Bishop Forcade resigned in September 1849, and Feliciani was re- appointed to be the Prefect Apostolic on 24 August 1850. His administration lasted for about 5 years, and again resigned on 20 June 1855. He left Hong Kong in October 1856 and went to work first in Shandong (from 1856 to 1859) and then in Shanxi, where he was appointed vicar general and rector of seminary. Feliciani died in Shanxi, China on 17 March 1866, at the age of 69.

The show was nominated for the 2007 Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special. According to Linda Mizejewski, a Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies professor at Ohio State University, in her book, Pretty/Funny: Women Comedians and Body Politics, the title of the special refers to the quote by Fannie Lou Hamer, \\"I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.\\"  Plot  Sykes begins her performance by sharing two anecdotes, the first about a surprising interaction with a fan and the second about a talkative child whom she was seated next to on a flight. Sykes then talks about American Idol, which she applauds for its meanness in making eliminated contestants sing before they are told to go home. Next, she addresses the joys of being a pet owner, mentioning her dog Riley. She talks about her love and respect for animals and expresses that she doesn‚Äôt understand how people can be cruel towards them. Keeping with the theme of animals, Sykes moves on to describe her experience swimming with a dolphin that she supposed to be racist. Sykes‚Äô next topic is money. She shares her misgivings about investing in stocks, comments on the national deficit, and criticizes the spending of government money on a space program. Sykes criticizes President George W. Bush‚Äôs foreign policy, his administration, and politicians in general. She talks about the adverse effects of politics on the elderly and women, addressing such issues as Medicaid and abortion. This discussion leads into a conversation about pornography which segues into a discourse on same-sex marriage. Sykes then talks about racial profiling and the ways in which people are treated differently depending on their race. She comments on prostitution and the objectification of women. Sykes wraps up her special by discussing her new-found sense of apathy and how it has affected her sex life.Sykes, Wanda. \\"Sick and Tired.\\" Dir. Michael Drumm. HBO. Seattle, 14 Oct. 2006.

Built in 1927, the single-story, yellow brick structure is basically a utilitarian building with Spanish Revival decorative elements on its primary and secondary fa√ßades. An addition from the early 1930s complements the original building, while additions from 1957 and 1977 do not. The last addition incorporated an unrelated brick building into the bakery complex. The original building was designed by the Toledo, Ohio architectural firm of Mills, Rhines, Bellman & Nordhoff, and built by the John G. Miller Construction Company. The building represents the consolidation of the bakery industry in the early 20th century from neighborhood retail bakers to local wholesalers to national industrial wholesale bakery companies. The Campbell Baking Company entered the Waterloo market as a financial backer of the Peerless Baking Company, which was formed in 1917.

Biography Tordenskjold Statue at R√•dhusplassen in Oslo Ender was born to a farming family at Asker in Akershus, Norway. He began his art studies from 1867 to 1871 with the sculptor, Julius Middelthun, at the Royal Drawing School. He later attended the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts (1872‚Äì74) and the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich (1875‚Äì80), with financial support from King Charles IV. He also conducted study trips to Munich (1875) and Paris (1878). His most notable project was the bronze sculpture of Peter Tordenskjold, Vice-Admiral in the Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy. His commission for the statue was the result of a major artistic competition. Ender worked for ten years (1891‚Äì1901) to complete his work which now stands at R√•dhusplassen in Oslo. For his finished work, he was made a Knight in the Royal Norwegian Order of Saint Olav. His paintings were frequently in the category of Romantic nationalism. Many of his early works were exhibited at the Christiania Kunstforening (now Oslo Kunstforening). Altarpieces of his creation may be seen at √Ösnes Church in Hedmark, Haug Church in Ringerike, Kampen Church in Oslo, √òstre Porsgrunn Church in Telemark and Lunner Church in Oppland.

It began in the 1980s in Hollywood, and continues in Hawaii today, often recruiting through yoga studios. The group has been described by some former members as being a cult.  Overview  = Leader = The leader of Buddhafield is a man previously known as Michel, Andreas, The Teacher or Reyji, born Jaime Gomez. He was once known to wear nothing but swim briefs and eyeliner, though now he is regularly seen wearing a surgical mask and using a cane.  History  = Post-Waco changes = Gomez voiced his anxieties to his then-follower Will Allen after the Waco siege.Holy Hell, directed by Will Allen (2016). Allen pinpoints this as the moment when Gomez's paranoia began. Gomez left his followers for six months to find a new location for the group. Gomez also began to undergo increasing amounts of plastic surgery around this time, as well as recommending his female followers undergo similar procedures. Gomez also attempted to get followers to report on each others' perceived digressions. He kept one follower from seeing her father before he died, and encouraged another to get an abortion, claiming religious reasons.  Beliefs  Buddhafield largely uses New Age ideas. Jaime Gomez thinks of himself as God, and encourages his followers to think of themselves as God as well. Buddhafield uses the Sanskrit word shakti (meaning \\"power\\") for Jaime Gomez' alleged power transference to his followers using his finger. Gomez also cites the Bhagavad Gita as a source. Gomez demanded his followers remain celibate despite himself allegedly having sexual intercourse with various followers. Drugs and alcohol were also banned from use while in the group. Buddhafield followers change names while in the group. Holy Hell director Will Allen explained that \\"A lot of the principles of the East vs. West that we were doing‚Äîsurrendering to the guru, dropping your ego, taking your shoes off before you walk into a room and leave the world behind‚Äîwe didn't think of it as giving our power, we thought of it as empowering.\\" Three to five hour ballet practices two to three days each week were often a part of the group's activities, with members even missing their jobs for practice. The resulting performance was never shown to anyone outside of Buddhafield.  Allegations  Many allegations have been made against Jaime Gomez, most notably sexual abuse of his male followers. His victims have said that they had their confessions in their weekly hypnotherapy sessions used against them. Gomez also used the AIDS crisis to instill fear in his gay male followers to frighten them into staying. Former members such as Chris Johnston, Julian Goldstein, Radhia Gleis and Alessandra Burenin claim they were brainwashed by Jaime Gomez. Allen and other former Buddhafield members claim that they were not allowed to obtain information from outside sources, with Gomez bristling at one member purchasing a television. Gomez shunned such ex-followers and denied the allegations.  Reaction to film  Jaime Gomez has allegedly sent followers to Holy Hell's Sundance Film Festival debut screenings to \\"physically threaten\\" ex-followers featured in the film. One of Gomez's bodyguards allegedly threatened a cast member after Sundance. Gomez's official statement is as follows: > The Teacher‚Äôs formal statement on the film: ‚ÄúIt is heartbreaking to see how > history has been rewritten. Holy Hell is not a documentary, rather, it is a > work of fiction designed to create drama, fear and persecution; that is what > sells. I am saddened by this attempt to obscure the message of universal > love and spiritual awakening. It is devastating to see these friends, who > were once so filled with love for the world, become so angry. I wish them > only the best, and hold each one close to my heart. If any of my actions > were a catalyst for their disharmony, I am truly sorry. May all beings find > peace, Michel.

Inteiror of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church. Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church () is a Roman Catholic church in the Diocese of Hong Kong. It is located in the Wanchai district at 1 Star Street. The church is unique being located within a private multi-storey residential building, rather than a stand-alone structure. The current parish priest is Rev. Thomas Law Kwok-Fai. History The current church situated in the historical site of St. Francis Xavier Chapel, which was the place of worship for Catholic faithful in the Wanchai area as early as 1845. (A previous version of this paper was presented at a Seminar 'Hong Kong: its people, culture and traditions, the Centre of Asian Studies, University of Hong Kong. 15-16 April 1983) There were religious communities, Catholic hospital, and homes for abandoned babies and blind women. As the number of faithful grew, the parish priest, Father James Zilioli, and the Wanchai faithful were determined to build a new church. The preparation effort started from 1934, but due to financial difficulty, construction work could only be able to start by the end of February 1949. The new church, named as named ‚ÄúHoly Souls Church‚Äù, was finally opened in 19 July 1950, which was the feast day of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. In 1957, the church was renamed to \\"Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church‚Äù. In the 1990s, the Diocese sold the property to secure funding for other purposes. With the dedication of the Diocese and assistance of local parishioners, agreement was reached with the developer to accommodate a church within the new premises. The new church was officially opened on 10 November 2001 by Bishop John Baptist Wu Cheng-chung.

The current headquarters are at the Western Chapter, located in Guadalajara, Jalisco. As a member of the Latin American Regional Center (CRAL), and the North American Regional Center (CRNA), the OMT has gained international presence and esteem. The Western Chapter of the Mexican Translators Association is an excellent forum and meeting place for translators and interpreters in Mexico. It offers courses and workshops, continuing education opportunities and a place for colleagues to exchange ideas and opinions. One of its most important purposes is to provide translators and interpreters with opportunities to participate in the recognition of the professions, both in the labor market and with the general public. The current chairwoman of the organization is Mich√®le Cecilia Arriola de la Mora. Origin and History In 1992, the Mexican Translators Association was established in Mexico City. Years later, due to growth of translation and interpreting across the country, other chapters of the OMT began to emerge, one of which was the Western Chapter. The Western Chapter began thanks to a group of experienced translators who started organizing informal get-togethers in Guadalajara, Jalisco. As time passed, this group of translators saw a need to expand. To do this, they began forming a network of professional contacts by establishing ties with the director of the Master's Program in Translation and Interpretation at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guadalajara (which was established in 1995), as well as organizing seminars to discuss subjects related to translation, among other activities. In 1999, when deciding on how to officially organize, the group of translators decided to associate with the Mexican Translators Association in Mexico City. This was how the translators in Guadalajara established a chapter of the national association. As of 2004, there were four chapters of the OMT: the Central Chapter (Mexico City), Puebla Chapter, the Villahermosa Chapter, the Western Chapter (with main offices in Guadalajara, Jalisco). Due to various challenges that arose in some chapters towards the end of this same year (2004), the Villahermosa and Puebla chapters were dissolved, and it was decided that the president would move to the Western Chapter. The Central Chapter in Mexico City also closed its doors later that year, leaving the Western Chapter as the only active seat in the OMT. Mission Upon its establishment as part of a national association, the Western Chapter set out the following specific objectives: *To promote the professional image of translators and interpreters. (The Western Chapter also included the figure of the interpreter in its articles of association, in addition to translators.) *To promote and provide a space for the exchange of knowledge between translators and interpreters. *To establish and promote quality and ethical standards. *To serve as a reference in the realm of education and research in translating and interpreting. Significant endeavors (1996-present) =St. Jerome International Translation and Interpreting Conference= In September 1996, a group of colleagues that would later form the Western Chapter of the Mexican Translators Association got together to celebrate International Translation Day at a restaurant. Twenty years later, this meeting has become an annual conference that brings together 250 language professionals to attend workshops, presentations and roundtable events given by speakers willing to share their points of view, experience and specialized knowledge in the field of translating and interpreting. Thanks to the support of various educational institutions throughout the years, the conference has become a forum where interpreters and translators can meet to update and hone their skills while reflecting on cultural and practical issues relating to their professional field. Since 2007, the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) has included the conference as part of their activities for professionals, and thanks to this, the conference is also able to offer more opportunities to network and explore the field of translating by taking part in other activities organized by the FIL. =Educational Offering in Translating and Interpreting= One of the main objectives of the Western Chapter has been to promote the specialized training of translators and interpreters. In pursuit of this, it offers two certificate courses: English to Spanish Translation and English to Spanish Legal Translation. The latter is officially recognized by Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education and offers an online version for members and students who are interested in the course but do not live in Guadalajara. At one time, the organization also offered a course in French, but it was canceled due to a lack of students. In addition, members also organize workshops and courses related to topics on translation, including translator tools (word processing programs, Wordfast, MemoQ), audiovisual translation, literary translation, pharmaceutical translation, consecutive and simultaneous interpreting, among a wide variety of subjects that arise from the need to remain competitive as professionals, among other reasons. =Relationships with academic institutions= Since 2002, the Western Chapter of the Mexican Translators Association has established relationships with universities and educational institutions with the Monterrey Institute of Technology, Leon Campus, the Angloamericano University Center, the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guadalajara, and others throughout Mexico. =Publications= Among its endeavors, another important goal at the Mexican Translators Association is to spread knowledge about translation and interpreting through publications and published a magazine in Puebla until 2003.

It was established by the author H√©ctor Germ√°n Oesterheld. History H√©ctor Germ√°n Oesterheld created two popular characters for the Misterix magazine, of the Abril publisher: Bull Rocket and Sergeant Kirk. He wrote novelizations of both comic books, and published them on his own, in a joint business with his brother Jorge. The success prompted him to start his own publishing house. He negotiated the characters with Cesare Civita, owner of Abril. It was arranged that Bull Rocket would stay in Misterix, written by new authors, and Oesterheld would take Kirk to his new publishing house, alongside the artist Hugo Pratt. The first comic books were the Comics anthologies Frontera and Hora Cero. The first was first published on April 1957, and the second on May 1957. Oesterheld wrote the most part of the scripts, either using his name or pseudonyms as \\"H. Sturgiss\\" or \\"C. de la Vega\\", and his brother wrote the rest, signing as \\"Jorge Mora\\". The anthologies were a success, and Frontera published new related magazines, \\"Suplemento Semanal Hora Cero\\", Hora Cero extra\\" and \\"Frontera extra\\". Some comics included in the anthologies soon become successful enough to have their own runs, such as Ernie Pike and Ticonderoga by Pratt, Randall the Killer by Arturo del Castillo, Sherlock Time by Alberto Breccia, Joe Zonda and Rolo, el marciano adoptivo by Francisco Solano L√≥pez. The weekly publication El Eternauta, by Oesterheld and Solano L√≥pez, was first published on September 4, 1957, at \\"Hora Cero semanal\\", and lasted until 1959. Frontera decayed in 1959, as most artists were hired to work in Europe. Frontera fell into bankruptcy in 1959, and the magazines were taken by the publisher Emilio Ram√≠rez to pay debts. They were published until 1963.

Many of the great Babylonian rabbis of modern times arose from its halls, and rabbis from across the Arab world pursued advanced studies there.  Founding  Before the establishment of the Midrash, Hakham Abdallah Somekh would teach students free of charge. This was noted with warm approval by the Baghdadi grandee Ezekiel Reuben, who had a history of making generous contributions to charitable enterprises in Iraq and Ottoman Palestine, including the establishment of the Beis Yaa‚Äôkov Synagogue for the Perushim in the Old City of Jerusalem. In 1840, Reuben bought a suitable courtyard and built a rabbinical school devoted to Somekh‚Äôs students. It was first entitled Midrash Abu Menashi, after the Arabic nickname bestowed upon Reuben when he had his son Menashi (pronounced with an ultimate ‚Äúi‚Äù according to the Iraqi dialect of Judaeo-Arabic). In Hakham Somekh's era  Abu Menashi contributed large sums to cover monthly living stipends for the student body. In those days there was also a large Heder called Midrash Talmud Torah which catered to orphans and children of the poor, and Somekh brought the top students to his Midrash to teach them Talmud and Posekim. Abu Menashi‚Äôs support of the expanded student body remained strong, sometimes extending to matchmaking and maintenance of their families. With time, Somekh‚Äôs efforts began to bear fruit. As the school expanded, its students earned an increasing reputation for wisdom and erudition. Graduates assumed positions as instructors within the institution, earning the title Hakham as each began to teach his own small Yeshiva of students. The traveller Benjamin II, who visited Baghdad in 1848, described his impression of the Midrash as follows: Ezekiel Reuben passed away on the 14th of Tamuz, 5611 (1851), leaving behind two similarly generous sons, Menashi and Sassoon. Not only did they retain their father‚Äôs stipends, but they also created new ones for students who had not been funded in his lifetime, and added to the base budget of the Midrash so that the students could learn with their full hearts. In 1854, Menashi closed the original building that his father had constructed for the Midrash. He bought three adjacent houses: the Bet Dali house and the homes of Ezra Zilkha and Haham Abdallah Khedir. On the combined lots, he built a synagogue that he named ‚ÄúMidrash Abu Menashi,‚Äù and a larger seminary building that he named ‚ÄúMidrash Bet Zilkha.‚Äù He also purchased a number of Sifre Torah for the use of both institutions. The seminary increased in stature with time, becoming a household name to all Mizrahi Jews, while a significant number of European Jews were also aware of it. Students from across Iraq came for the chance to be steeped in the Torah of Somekh. The seminary ordained some of the great rabbis of the generation, who served in communities in Iraq, Persia, India, and the Levant. The traveller Jehiel Fischel, who visited Baghdad on the 14th of Sivan 5620 (1860), wrote: In 1863, there were 30 scholars whose sole duty was to teach rabbinical students at the seminary. The greater Midrash was subdivided into many smaller Yeshivot, one for each of this staff of instructors. In 1869, the number of Yeshivot had been consolidated to ten. Students from Kurdistan, Persia, India, and Central Asia would flock to Baghdad to learn at the Midrash. The Rosh Yeshiba was engaged in answering halakhic queries that were sent to him from abroad. Many of the questions dealt with marriages and divorce, lacunae in the education of the Persian rabbinate. Many were written in Hebrew and Aramaic, as well as a few in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, which demanded a substantial staff of scribes who were proficient in Eastern languages. Thus did Babylonian Jewry earn the popular play on Isaiah 3:2 ‚Äúfor the Torah will spring forth from Baghdad, and the word of God from its Yeshibot!‚Äù  Burning of the Midrash  In 1937, after the departure of the Kabbalist Hakham Yehuda Fatiyah from Baghdad and his emigration to Mandatory Palestine, there was a fierce controversy between the rabbinate and the community. At the height of the dispute, thugs on the side of the community ignited the Midrash complex in an act of spiteful arson. The entire Bet Midrash including most of the Sifre Torah and its extensive library were burned to ashes. A sole surviving Sefer Torah from the original Midrash, dating to the early 17th century, has been transported to the Be‚Äôer Hana synagogue in Netanya. At the time of the blaze, some elders were learning in a back room and became trapped by the flames. An oral tradition claims that as the fire reached their room they began to recite the Shema, and suddenly someone opened an external window and lowered a pole that allowed them to climb out. To this day it is not known who saved them. After the conflagration, the rabbinic staff taught in other synagogues during the two years of reconstruction of the Midrash. The King himself assumed responsibility for the restoration effort despite the fact that the arsonists were never caught or imprisoned. The library was reestablished in a diminished form with donations and offerings.  Farhud  In June 1941, after the bloody pogrom known as the farhud struck the Jewish community of Baghdad, chief rabbi Yaakov Mutzafi opened the gates of Midrash Bet Zilkha to survivors of the atrocity who were evicted from their homes. He also arranged for their upkeep via donations from philanthropists in the community.Hakhmei Bavel, Hebrew; Yeshivath Hod Yosef Publishing House, ppg. 229-230  See also  * Great Synagogue of Baghdad  References  Judaism in Iraq Jewish Iraqi history Jews and Judaism in Baghdad Schools in Baghdad Sephardic yeshivas ","title":"Midrash Bet Zilkha"},{"id":"52435732","text":"Jos√© Carlos Ram√≠rez Su√°rez (born 10 May 1996), known as Jos√© Carlos, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for AD Alcorc√≥n as a central defender.

The congregation was founded sometime before 1728 and three successive church buildings have occupied the same location since that time. The church was closed in 2016. History =Beginnings= Though Germantown was dominated by Germans from its founding in 1683, the Lutheran denomination did not become well established there until after 1740. Different German religious denominations grew and changed once they came to America. The first settlers were German Quakers and the Mennonite church soon become important in the town. Dunkards, Moravians, the German Reformed Church and other groups joined the religious mix. The Lutheran and Reformed churches had the largest membership in Germantown in the last half of the eighteenth century, with the Lutherans becoming the largest by the end of the century. See pages 211-236.. St. Michael's and other churches were affected by the lack of ordained ministers, who often rode circuits to serve many churches. It was not until 1790 that a pastor was able to settle his family in Germantown. See page 231.. The first historical record of the St. Michael's congregation is in 1728 on the death of its first pastor, Anthony Jacob Henckel, who is buried in the cemetery. Sometime after 1731 John Christian Schulz may have briefly served the Germantown congregation before returning to Germany seeking support for Pennsylvania Lutherans. See pp. 67-68 John Dylander, the Swedish pastor of Gloria Dei (Old Swedes) Church from 1737-1742, served many Lutheran churches, both Swedish and German, during this time, including the church in Germantown. Several deeds and land leases were dated between 1737 and 1751 and cover about 4 acres, from Germantown Avenue to the current Musgrave Street, bounded on the northwest by the current East Phil Ellena Street. More than half this area is still occupied by the church building or cemetery though the area from Ross St. to Musgrave St. is occupied by other buildings. Beggarstown School in 1972 The first stone church on the site may have been built in 1730. This building was expanded in 1746 and provided with a bell tower and pipe organ in the 1750s. Beggarstown School is a small adjacent building built c. 1740, which was used to teach basic reading, writing, and arithmetic to local students. While most students were part of the congregation, some attended simply because it was the closest local school. See page 33. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.NRHP Nomination Form for Beggarstown School, 1971, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, CRGIS, accessed December 2, 2016. Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, the patriarch of the Lutheran Church in America, was an early pastor after arriving in Pennsylvania in 1742. He was assigned to three churches: in Providence (the current Trappe), New Hanover and in Philadelphia proper. The church in Philadelphia, located on 5th Street, was confusingly also called St. Micheal's. Muhlenberg, however, served many other churches, including St. Michael's in Germantown. Charles W. Schaeffer, who was later pastor of St. Michael's Germantown, wrote in his Early History of the Lutheran Church in America that the Germantown church was the fourth church where Muhlenberg became pastor, but that \\"he treated (it) as an appendage of the church in Philadelphia.\\" See p. 100. Kline states that the Germantown church joined the other three churches in a united congregation three or four months after the others. In 1745 Muhlenberg assigned the Germantown and Philadelphia churches to Peter Brunnholz, an ordained minister newly arrived from Germany. After Brunnholtz died, Muhlenberg replaced him in 1757 with John Frederick Handschuh. Handschuh faced a revolt from the congregation in 1760, which ostensibly started because of bells attached to collection baskets. The congregation's dissatisfaction with Handschuh and with Muhlenberg was substantial, involving issues of local versus centralized control by Muhlenberg, their places of origin within Germany, and Muhlenberg's pietistic theological training. A small part of the congregation supporting Muhlenberg formed a new church, calling their own pastor, J. Nicholas Kurtz. In 1762 they regained partial use of St. Michael's building by court order. In 1764 they called another pastor, John Ludwig Voigt, which led to a reconciliation of the congregation. Johann Frederick Schmidt served as pastor from 1769, through the Revolutionary War, until 1786. He was an advocate of American independence and fled from the British during the Battle of Germantown in 1777. The parsonage, now known as the Michael Billmeyer House, is located near the corner of Germantown Avenue and Upsal Street, where an attack on Cliveden was directed. The parsonage was looted during the battle, and the church was occupied with the organ and pews destroyed. The large cemetery which surrounds the church includes graves of several veterans of the Revolutionary War. In 1785 the church was officially incorporated by an Act of Assembly of Pennsylvania. =Nineteenth century= Germantown's residents had begun assimilating into American culture and religion during the eighteenth century as German-speakers intermarried with English-speakers and some of their children spoke mainly English. Non-Germans migrated to the village as it grew into a suburb of Philadelphia. During the nineteenth century the assimilation continued and in 1854 the suburb was annexed by Philadelphia. By 1811 the village had Anglo- American Methodist, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian churches. Frederick David Schaeffer, who had immigrated from Germany at age sixteen in 1776, served as pastor of St. Michael's from 1790-1812. On January 1, 1813, one source reports that the congregation voted to conduct the service in English on alternate Sundays. The church's Sunday school, one of the first in the United States was begun in 1817, to teach underprivileged children on a day when they were off from work. The Sunday school program later started branches in Chestnut Hill, Nicetown, Rising Sun, and other nearby neighborhoods. A new church was built on the site in 1819 at the same time the old church was being torn down. The bells were damaged during the demolition, so a new bell tower was not constructed. The current building was dedicated in 1897. The Rev. John C. Baker served St. Michael's from 1812 to about 1826. In 1826 he was called to a church in Harrisburg and replaced by the Rev. Benjamin Keller. Keller resigned about 1837 over disputes on the question of using English or German during church services, as well as the question of the role of women in the church. Members of the congregation formed the English Evangelical Lutheran Church in Germantown, later known as Trinity Lutheran Church, in 1836. Services continued using only German until 1845 when S. Mosheim Schmucker, who only spoke English, became the new pastor. Members of the congregation who preferred German services formed the St. Thomas German Church. The German Reformed church on Market Square experienced similar language conflicts and splintering, until its 1854 transformation into the Market Square Presbyterian Church. Keller's step son, the Rev. Charles W. Schaeffer was pastor from 1849-1875. Charles W. was the grandson of Frederick David Schaeffer and the author of Early History of the Lutheran Church in America. He helped organize the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, near St. Michael's, and served there as Professor of Ecclesiastical History. A new parsonage was constructed in 1855. and a Sunday School building in 1866. Schaeffer married Elizabeth Fry Ashmead Schaeffer in 1836. She worked to raise the role of women in the church and was the founder and first director of the Lutheran Home at Germantown for orphans. This institution is still in operation and was originally located two blocks north of St. Michael's. The Gothic Revival church currently on the site was designed by Philadelphia architect T. Frank Miller and built 1896-1897.Philadelphia Architects and Buildings It is a contributing building to the Colonial Germantown Historic District, a National Landmark district. =20th and 21st centuries= By 1900 Germantown had become better integrated into the city of Philadelphia and less of a German suburb. Manufacturing plants and housing for workers grew in southern Germantown, with more than 4,000 workers employed by 82 textile firms. To the north, Chestnut Hill and Mt. Airy developed exclusive residential areas along commuter railways. In 1900 only 7.2% of Germantown's population were German immigrants or first generation German-Americans. Manufacturing jobs continued to grow until the end of World War II, then declined. As part of the Great Migration of African-Americans from the south, the ethnic character of the neighborhood changed by the mid 20th century. As manufacturing jobs declined, St. Michael's became part of an \\"inner city\\" neighborhood. The St. Thomas German Church, which had separated from St. Michael's in 1845, merged back into St. Michael's in 1957 when its Pastor, Kurt E. B. Molzhan, was called to serve at St. Michael's. German service began to be held again, along with English services. The Rev. Andrena Ingram was pastor from 2006-2016. She was the first African American woman pastor at St. Michael's. Under her guidance the church worked with local charities, reaching out to the diverse Germantown community, including the poor, the sick, and the hungry. The church promoted HIV/AIDS awareness and offered free HIV testing and prevention programs. By 2012 the congregation had only about 35 members and the sanctuary was closed over the winter to avoid the cost of heating. The church remained active for over 288 years until it closed on September 11, 2016. Bishop Claire Schenot Burkat of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod presided at the final service, assisted by the Rev. Dr. Philip D.W. Krey, a former member of the congregation and the retired president of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia. The Synod is now responsible for the church and cemetery.

Delligatti was an early franchisee of the fast food restaurant chain McDonald's, opening the first of his eventual 48 branches in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1957. Delligatti is also credited as the creator of McDonald's \\"Big Mac\\" hamburger in 1967. Early life Michael James Delligatti was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, on August 2, 1918, the son of James Delligatti, a farrier, cobbler and candy maker, and his wife, Lucille Dandrea. He was educated there and at Fairmont Senior High School in Fairmont, West Virginia, before serving in Europe during World War II with the United States Army, where he was discharged after suffering from trench foot. Career Big Mac hamburger After the war, Delligatti owned a drive-through restaurant in Newport Beach, California and, after meeting Ray Kroc at a restaurant fair in 1955, Delligatti started as a McDonald's franchisee in 1957. His franchise was based in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, about south of Pittsburgh, and his holdings grew to 48 stores. Delligatti thought up the concept for the Big Mac in 1965 and started serving it at his Uniontown McDonald's in April 1967 for 45 cents. By 1968, the Big Mac was on the menu of every American McDonald's, and in 1969, it accounted for 19% of total sales. According to a 1970s jingle the burger contains: \\"two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun.\\" Interviewed by the Los Angeles Times in 1993, Delligatti agreed that he was not the inventor of the double-decker burger: \\"This wasn't like discovering the lightbulb. The bulb was already there. All I did was screw it in the socket.\\" In an interview with a Pittsburgh television station, Delligatti said that he had received no royalty payments for the creation of the Big Mac, but had received a plaque. According to his son Michael, Jim ate a Big Mac every week. In 2007, Delligatti opened the Big Mac Museum, home to the \\"world's largest Big Mac\\", which is more than across. As of 2016, McDonald's sells about 550 million Big Macs in the U.S. every year. Personal life and death Delligatti was married twice, with his first marriage to Ann Vunora ending in divorce. They had one son. He and his second wife, Eleanor \\"Ellie\\" Carmody, had one son, five grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. He died on November 28, 2016, at his home in Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania, at age 98.

Local residents named the area the Sangong River Valley after one of the largest rivers in this region, which originates from Bogeda Peak. Altogether, five major landscapes are distributed throughout the northern and southern areas of the biosphere reserve: ice-snow belts (5,445‚Äì3,100 meters above sea level), alpine and sub-alpine meadow belts (3,100‚Äì2,500 meters asl), forest belts (2,500‚Äì1,600 meters asl), steppe belts (1,700‚Äì900 meters asl) and sand desert dunes (460‚Äì3,300 meters asl). The topography consists of a middle mountain belt, low mountain erosion hills and alluvial areas. Tianchi Lake is the only natural lake in the region and lies adjacent to the Sangong River. Ecology The Bogeda Biosphere Reserve is situated within the temperate continental arid climate zone. Different habitat types range from snowy landscapes to meadows, steppe and sand dunes, offering ideal circumstances for the development of a rich biodiversity. Alpine and sub-alpine landscapes with Koresia capilliformis and perennial herbaceous cover approximately 80% of the area. The low plain lingo halophyte vegetation desert zone contains flora species such as Suaeda physophora and Halostachys caspica. Characteristic fauna species include Ciconia nigra (Black stork), Buteo rufinus (Long-legged buzzard) and Felis lynx (Eurasian lynx). However, numerous endangered or threatened animal species within the biosphere reserve struggle for survival, including Falco subbuteo (Eurasian hobby) and Gazella subgutturosa (Black-tailed gazelle) among others. The region is also home to species of commercial or traditional importance, such as Cistanche salsa, which grows in desert habitats and is used for traditional Chinese medicine. Socio-economic characteristics Tian Shan mountains, Bogeda Biosphere Reserve About 134,000 people inhabit the Bodega biosphere reserve permanently, while over 410,000 people visit on a seasonal basis. The main economic activities are livestock, agriculture and tourism. The majority of inhabitants are Han Chinese (80%) with Hui (5%), Hasake (4%) and Uygur (4%) populations also living in the reserve. The nearest major town is Fukang City, located in the transition zone. Since the 1960s, the underground freshwater table has deepened, while the underground salt water table has risen. The result has been serious soil salinization and erosion, which hinders the cultivation of agricultural products. The Tianchi Lake, located in the core area on the mountains, is a Taoist shrine and constitutes the main cultural and traditional site of the Bogeda Biosphere Reserve.

I:170:173. He graduated from Columbia University and Yale University and served as an economics professor of Tsinghua University. He is regarded as one of China's most skilled economists and bankers in the 20th century. Life = Early life and education = Chen was born in Nanhai in Guangdong Province in 1870, the son of a merchant from Hong Kong. He graduated from Queens College in Hong Kong. He received a master's degree in math from Columbia University in 1902. He received a doctorate in political economy from Yale University in 1906. When he returned to China, he received the highest score in an imperial exam for students returning from abroad. For this reason, he is sometimes referred to as China‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst foreign scholar.‚Äù = Financial reforms and founding Bank of China = In 1908, Chen was appointed deputy director of the bureau of printing and engraving and sent on a mission overseas to investigate methods of postage stamp production. Chen concluded that American printing techniques were the best at preventing counterfeiting. He hired two American experts, William A. Grant and Lorenzo J. Hatch, to upgrade China‚Äôs postage stamp manufacturing. When he returned to China, Chen was appointed head of a currency reform board. Following the 1911 Revolution, President Sun Yat-sen, who at this time headed a southern government based in Nanjing, named Chen minister of finance. Chen did not take up the post as he was abroad attending currency-related conferences. When he returned to China in September 1912, Chen was appointed the chief financial officer and head of the central audit office in Beijing. In 1912, he also helped turn the Daqing Bank (Â§ßÊ∏ÖÈì∂Ë°å) into the Bank of China, becoming the founder and first deputy advisor of the PBC. In 1916, Chen was promoted to finance minister by Prime Minister Duan Qirui. When Duan was dismissed in May 1917, Chen was arrested for embezzlement. The Communications Clique was blamed for the arrest. Chen was exonerated in February 1918. Chen returned to public service when Duan was restored as premier in November 1924. In 1926-1927, the Nationalists in the South advanced north and defeated the Beiyang militarists based in Beijing. In the spring of 1927, the Nationalists arrested Chen in Hangzhou and accused him of collusion with the leftist Wuhan government--a charge later dropped. With the Nationalists in power, in 1929, Chen became professor of economics at Tsinghua University in Beijing. In the early 1930s, Chen briefly retired to Tianjin. In early 1935, he was appointed as an adviser on currency matters to H. H. Kung, the Nationalist finance minister. = World War 2 = In 1937, the Japanese occupied Nanjing, the Nationalist capital. While Kung and other officials fled to Chongqing, Chen remained at his post. In March 1938, he was appointed minister of finance in the collaborationist regime of Liang Hongzhi. The Liang regime had jurisdiction in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Chen retained this post until he died in June 1939.  Contributions and reform  Before 1928, Chen was one of the few Chinese officials considered expert or competent by China‚Äôs foreign diplomats. He was responsible for significant improvements in printing and engraving, as well as founding the Bank of China. The currency reforms of the early Republican period may be credited to Chen. He was a technocrat who diligently served China. He was apparently indifferent as to whether the government was imperialist, militarist, Nationalist, or collaborationist. Other than for the sake of running China's banks, his views and motives remain elusive.  Publications  He is known for writing Junfu„ÄäÂùáÂØå„Äã(meaning roughly 'Equal Wealth'), a treatise on capital and banking.

It is named after a monk, or monks, who was said to have lived in a cave in the park for a while. The cave is now a pilgrimage destination for the monk's devotees. Location The Monge State Park is in the municipality of Lapa, Paran√°. It has an area of in the Atlantic Forest biome. The vegetation consists of open fields with some groups of trees and forests. There are access roads cutting through the park, and plantations of exotic trees. The park also has waterfalls and a source of water that it considered to be miraculous. It is in the Igua√ßu River basin. History The Monge State Park was created by decree 33.427 of 21 November 1960, and altered by subsequent decrees and laws in 1962, 1964, 1977 and 1979. A quarry was operated in the park at one time, but has been closed down. Ownership is divided between the Environmental Institute of Paran√° (IAP) and the municipality. When the management plan was issued in December 2002 the area was , other than areas that had not been expropriated. The original vegetation had been cleared and replaced in the 1950s with pine and eucalyptus, invasive species. The IAP prepared a plan to eliminate the invasive specieas and restore the original meadows, funding the project from sale of the lumber. About 640 truck loads of logs were bought by a timber company in 2010, but the money was not reinvested in the park. Exotic trees reemerged. The existing infrastructure had been demolished, but work on the new structures was abandoned due to a moratorium by the state government. The park became a hang-out for drug users. A new company was hired in 2013, and work resumed early in 2014. In February 2014 it was reported that the park would reopen in a few months with limited access after a process of structural modernization. The park would now promote tourism and trade in regional handicrafts. The sidewalks would be improved, as well as the parking area, oratory, lookout point and other facilities. Monks Three \\"monks\\" named Jo√£o Maria played a significant role in Lapa and other parts of Paran√° and Santa Catarina. The first, Jo√£o Maria d'Agostini, was an Italian immigrant who preached in the Matriz da Lapa in 1845. He travelled through the region giving guidance and prescribing medicinal herbs. After he left his devotees expected him to reappear. The \\"monk's cave\\" in the park is thought to have been his home. The second monk, Anast√°s Marcaf, arrived in Lapa in 1894 with the troops of Gumercindo Saraiva during the Federalist Revolution. A peaceful man, he had great influence with the country people. The third monk was Miguel Lucena de Boaventura, who appeared during the dispute between the governments of Paran√° and Santa Catarina over the Contestado territory. He appealed to the people who had been dispossessed or wronged by the government of the time, arming them and giving them military instruction. He called himself Jos√© Maria de Agostinho, brother of the first monk, and attracted growing numbers of followers. They were attacked in 1912 by Colonel Jo√£o Gualberto. The colonel and the monk both died in combat, but the struggle continued until final defeat of the Contestado revolt after thousands had died. Activities The park is visited for research, surveillance and religious tourism. There is a restaurant and bar in the park, and other vendors at the entrance. The park has volleyball courts, grills, snack bar, restaurant and sanitary facilities. The main attraction is the monk's cave, a place of religious pilgrimage for thousands of faithful. The monk Jo√£o Maria D‚ÄôAgostini lived in the cave for some time, studying the plants of the region, praying, tending the sick and prophesying. The grotto is reached by a long stone staircase that lead down to a source of pure water. From here a trail leads to the \\"Pedra Partida\\", a large hall formed by a cleft in the rock formed through erosion.

It was founded in 2016 and launched the following year by former Politico team members Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen and Roy Schwartz. The site's name is based on the (), meaning \\"worthy\\". Axios articles are typically brief and matter-of- fact: most are shorter than 300 words and use bullet points so they are easier to scan. In addition to news articles, Axios produces daily and weekly industry-specific newsletters (including Allen's Axios AM, a successor to his popular Playbook newsletter for Politico), two daily podcasts and a documentary news series on HBO.  History  VandeHei said he wanted Axios to be a \\"mix between The Economist and Twitter.\\" The company initially targeted covered a mix of news about business, politics, technology, healthcare, and media. VandeHei said Axios would focus on the \\"collision between tech and areas such as bureaucracy, health care, energy, and the transportation infrastructure\\". At launch, Nicholas Johnston, a former managing editor at Bloomberg L.P., was named editor-in-chief. In the summer of 2016, Axios secured $10 million in a round of financing led by Lerer Hippeau Ventures. Backers include media-partner NBC News, Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective, Greycroft Partners, and David and Katherine Bradley, owners of Atlantic Media. The company had raised $30 million . It planned to focus on \\"business, technology, politics, and media trends.\\" Axios generates revenue through short-form native advertising and sponsored newsletters. It earned more than $10 million in revenue in its first seven months. Its advertisers include Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries. In January 2017, Axios hired as an executive vice president Evan Ryan, the assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs and a former staffer for Vice President Joe Biden. In March 2017, the company said it had 60 employees with 40 working in editorial. Axios had six million visitors in September 2017, according to comScore. As of November 2017, Axios said it had 200,000 subscribers to 11 newsletters, with an average open rate of 52%. The same month, it said it would use a new $20 million investment to expand data analysis, product development, fund audience growth, and increase staff to 150, up from 89. In March and April 2019, HuffPost and Wired reported that Axios had paid a firm to improve its reputation by lobbying for changes to the Wikipedia articles on Axios and Jonathan Swan. In September 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that Axios was on track to be profitable in 2020 \\"despite the economic turmoil stemming from the coronavirus that led to broad layoffs and pay cuts at many media outlets.\\"  Content  Axios's content is designed for digital platforms, such as Facebook and Snapchat, as well as its own website. Reporters have made appearances on television news on NBC News and MSNBC through a deal with NBC. Its NBC Universal partnership has featured co-founder Mike Allen on its show Morning Joe. Content is distributed via newsletters covering politics, technology, healthcare, and other subjects. Among the newsletters is a daily report by Allen, who formerly wrote Politico's Playbook newsletter. Typical articles are shorter than 300 words. In 2018 the literary magazine n+1's editors identified Axios as an example of a new style of writing that \\"is simultaneously careful and strident, low-key and declarative\\" in order to cater to impatient readers. They wrote, \\"Axios, whose name is a cross between a defense contractor and an aggressive men's deodorant, has dispensed with everything but theses and bullet points.\\" = Axios on HBO = A documentary series based on the website's reporting, also titled Axios (sometimes disambiguated as Axios on HBO), began airing on HBO in the United States and internationally on November 4, 2018. The program, which primarily features interviews with political and business figures in the news, is a co- production of Axios Media, HBO Documentary Films, and DCTV. Initially airing on Sunday evenings in blocks of four consecutive weeks once or twice a year, the program switched to year-round biweekly production, airing on Monday nights, starting in April 2020.

Education and Life  Cianciolo grew up in Providence, Rhode Island where she was raised in an Italian-American household of four generations. In her late teens she moved to New York City and in 1992 she earned her BFA from the Parsons School of Design. She now lives in Brooklyn, New York with her daughter Lilac Sky Cianciolo, with whom she regularly collaborates. As a young adult Cianciolo worked various jobs within New York's creative sector. She created the window displays at Bergdorf Goodman, worked as a graphic designer, illustrator, and for many fashion brands including Geoffrey Beene and X-Girl, the fashion line of Kim Gordon from the band Sonic Youth. Work and Career Cianciolo founded the Run Collection in 1995, a fashion line of hand crafted clothing made from found or recycled garments and textiles. Between 1995 and 2006 she released 11 collections from which selected pieces have been featured at Barneys and several other retailers and fashion magazines such as Vogue. In 2006 she collaborated with Cone Denim, a heritage mill in South Carolina, to release a collection of garments accompanied by two shows in New York and Los Angeles and a book, The Women of the Crowd, published by Printed Matter. Cianciolo taught at the Parsons School of Design from 2008 - 2011. Cianciolo identifies as \\"a designer who also makes art, and a conceptual artist who occasionally designs clothes\\" and has frequently pursued venues outside of the runway for her fashion to be exhibited including theater plays, musical productions, and video works. She continues to create iterations of her initial fashion concepts in new forms such as the Run Home Collection and the Run Restaurant. In 2001 the Run Restaurant took place in Alleged Galleries in the Meatpacking District of New York City. The month long project transformed the gallery into an eclectic restaurant with handmade decor and affordable meals prepared by the artist and her friends. Cianciolo installed a version of Run Restaurant for the 2017 Whitney Biennial in the Whitney Museum's Eatery Untitled in collaboration with chef Michael Anthony.

The reserve covers a range of forest and wetland ecosystems rich in biological diversity, including many types of endangered and rare species. Ecological interference by humans is minimal, resulting in abundant natural resources and the high quality of local vegetation and ecology. The cold temperate coniferous forest represents the most well-preserved forest system in China and is of significant scientific value. The local wetlands include Larix gmelinii swamps and Carex wetlands and have retained their original natural landscapes and wetland functions. The biosphere reserve plays a significant role in protecting water and rare wildlife resources, ensuring water purification, and maintaining the ecological balance of the Heilongjiang area and Jiliuhe River. Ecology The reserve is situated at a high altitude on the western part of the main ridge of the northern Greater Khingan Mountains. The surrounding mountains form a flat valley stretching north to south for 56 km and 32 km wide. The reserve includes a wide variety of wetlands covering more than 20,000 ha, including river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands, forest swamp, bush swamp and herbaceous swamp. The reserve also belongs to a coniferous forest ecosystem amid tundra mountains. The main vegetation forms within the reserve are Taiga forest and coniferous forest including Pinus pumila elfin and Pinus sylvestris. Hanma has a highly abundant biological diversity. Typical species include the Siberian salamander (Salamandrella keyserlingii), wolverine (Gulo gulo), moose (Alces alces cameloides), Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus), sable (Martes zibellina), great grey owl (Strix nebulosa) and other near arctic animals. Socio-economic characteristics The biosphere reserve contains the last Reindeer tribe in China distributed in and around the transition area. Thirty Evenks people owning about 300 reindeers live in the transition area as permanent inhabitants. However, the elderly and children often leave the reserve to obtain medical treatment and education, and also leave for warmer climates during the winter. The tribe's lifestyle based on hunting and living on grassland has endured for centuries and persists to this day. Their social development has resulted in the creation of remarkable minority culture based upon Shamanism, which has given local hunters a deep belief in worshipping nature and protecting natural beings. Their religious traditions, agricultural production, ways of living and unique cultural customs have left a profound mark on the Hanma Biosphere Reserve and play an important role in the region‚Äôs natural protection. The Evenks' love and passion for nature, forests and lakes have been instrumental in maintaining the state of the forest. Approximately 43,536 people live around the periphery of the Hanma reserve, including 17,641 people at Jinhe Town, 19,363 people at Ah Longshan Town and 6,532 people at Niuerhe Town. These communities rely on the natural resources of the reserve in terms of ecosystem products and services, for example, gathering and selling berries and fungi from the transition area of the reserve.

Many of these labor movements began when Kuomintang became more lenient with social movements. In addition, with the help of non- KMT political figures, such as members of the Democratic Progressive Party, many labor unions and State-owned enterprise administrations removed KMT's influence, and this reshaped a huge economic sector of Taiwan from being strictly controlled by the state.  History  = Prior to martial law = During the period of martial law in Taiwan from 1949, the Kuomintang (KMT) prohibited the formation of new political parties, outlawed collective action including labor strikes, and censored all media. It built Leninist-style party organizations in major factories, and state corporates and factory organizers worked together to tackle worker's subjections. The KMT government also executed a national industrialization policy that led to the development of many specific industries including transportation, electricity, petroleum, and telecommunications as state-owned or public companies. Labor unions were then formed to support the state and its economic plan, instead of providing a collective bargaining platform for workers in these state-own industries. It was not until the 1980s when the emergence of new political forces from the new middle class emerged within Taiwan, weakening the Kuomintang's strong opposition to social movements. The Democratic Progressive Party was formed in 1986, and martial law ended in 1987. Initially, the labor movements focused on issues such as overtime and annual bonuses, but then this movement turned into seizures of labor unions. Many corporates had close ties with the Kuomintang, but with the labor movements, the KMT party branches lost their privileges within these enterprises. = Post-martial law = In the early 1990s, labor unions began to demand that the KMT withdraw its force and influence from unions. They did so by spreading stories of party corruption, and worked with the DPP to uncover illegal activities of the KMT. During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, labor disputes and unemployment issues were brought to the attention of the government, and workers began to recognize the importance of autonomous unions. After the 2000 election, the Kuomintang lost its position as the ruling party in both the Legislative Yuan and the executive branch. The Democratic Progressive Party introduced a bill to revise the Labor Standards Law and tried to set a legal limit of 44 working hours per week. However, after compromising with the KMT, the bill was revised to set the legal working period to 84 hours per two weeks. This law went into effect in 2001. This was seen as the first move of the DPP asserting their executive power over labor movements. In addition to the revision of Labor Standards law, the state also revised Union law and Labor Dispute Mediation law. The organization of labor in the 1980s did not have much involvement of opposition political figures. However, workers followed their agendas and asserted their opposition to the enterprises and the government. As the labor movement progressed, there was also an increase in disputes between workers and their employers. The number of disputed cases rose from 1609 cases in 1987 to 10955 cases in 2001. There was also an increase in union membership as the labor movement progressed. The unionization rate increased from 37.58% in 1987 to 39.40% in 2001. In addition, many state-owned enterprises privatized starting 1989, and about 30 companies privatized between 1989 and 2003. The privatization of state-owned enterprises was not because these companies faced economic pressure such as debts, but from political and macro-economic conditions.

Smith (c. 1890 ‚Äì c. 1940), variously known as the Howling Wolf, \\"Funny Paper\\" Smith, \\"Funny Papa\\" Smith, and Howling Smith, was an American blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. He released around ten singles in his own name or variants thereof. He also recorded with Bernice Edwards, Black Boy Shine, Magnolia Harris, and Dessa Foster. His best-known song was \\"Howling Wolf Blues\\", of which several variants were recorded. Many of his original recordings were unreleased at the time. All are now available on compilation albums. Little is known about Smith, and some reported details of his life may be apocryphal. Smith's music has been compared to that of Blind Lemon Jefferson, and his guitar playing was similar in style to that of other Texas guitarists around in his lifetime. One factor that set him apart from his contemporaries was his lyrical compositions, which were highly original. On more than one occasion, his verses were so full that he had to split the song between both sides of the three-minute limitation imposed by the standard 78-rpm disc. Life and career Smith was probably born in Texas. Details of his early life are not known. His first professional role involved him working at the Lincoln Theater in New York City. He married in the 1920s and spent most of the decade as an itinerant musician, travelling around Texas and Oklahoma, performing at parties, fish fries and juke joints, often in the company of Thomas Shaw, Alger \\"Texas\\" Alexander, and Little Hat Jones. He also was seen in the Dallas, Texas, area in the 1920s and 1930s, but he never recorded there. His first recordings were made in Chicago on September 18 and 19, 1930. \\"Howling Wolf Blues\\" (parts one and two) was issued by Vocalion (Vocalion 1558) as his first single. Several sources have noted that his guitar was often out of tune, even on some of his recordings, and Shaw commented that Smith was not an accomplished guitarist. Another oddity was that although Smith called himself \\"Funny Papa\\", his record label Vocalion managed to mistake this for \\"Funny Paper\\" Smith, and that is how he was billed on his earliest releases. He recorded almost twenty songs for Vocalion in 1930 and 1931, including the aforementioned \\"Howling Wolf Blues\\", from which he acquired another pseudonym, \\"The Howling Wolf\\". Smith reportedly wore a stovepipe hat with \\"Funny Papa Smith\\" stitched upon it. Between September 1930 and April 1935, he recorded forty-one songs, but only half that number were released at that time. Around this time he performed on weekends with Thomas Shaw. In 1931, Smith was arrested after being involved in a fight in a gambling establishment and allegedly killing a man in an argument over a woman. He was jailed on a charge of murder and spent a few years in a Texas penitentiary. In 1935, he recorded some songs for the Vocalion label in Fort Worth, Texas, but they were not released. Along the way he recorded with Bernice Edwards, Black Boy Shine, Magnolia Harris, and Dessa Foster. More than one source noted that Magnolia Harris was probably a pseudonym for the contractually obliged Victoria Spivey. In 1939, he toured with Alger \\"Texas\\" Alexander. Smith's subsequent whereabouts are unknown. It has been reported that he died in 1940, but the blues historians Bob Eagle and Eric S. LeBlanc reckoned from their research that it was \\"after 1947\\". References Other sources *Harris, Sheldon (1979). Blues Who's Who: A Biographical Dictionary of Blues Singers.

Early career Ahlefeldt began his military career by serving as a page and an officer in Imperial service, and as an officer in Wallenstein's army. He later became a groom of the bedchamber to King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway. His first wife having died, he was in 1643 betrothed to the King's natural daughter with Vibeke Kruse, Elisabeth Sofie Gyldenl√∏ve, although she was only ten; they finally married five years later.Bricka, C.F.

Senior officer When the war with Sweden began in 1643, Ahlefeldt became first a lieutenant colonel, and soon enough a major general, of cavalry. After the death of Christian IV, he was persecuted by Corfitz Ulfeldt, who had him dismissed from his posts and sent to Gl√ºckstadt as commandant. Ahlefeldt supported Frederick III in his struggle with Ulfeldt, and became Generalfeldwachtmeister in 1653. In 1659, Ahlefeldt, by now a lieutenant general, successfully defended the western front of Copenhagen against desperate Swedish attacks during the siege of Copenhagen. He then commanded all Danish forces in Jutland, and took Frederiksodde from the Swedes. In 1660 Ahlefeldt became commander-in-chief of the Norwegian army, as well as Amtmann of Bergenhus len. As such he commanded the Danish-Norwegian forces during the Battle of V√•gen, having refused the bribes offered him by the English. During the reign of Christian V, he had the rank, but not the command, of a field-marshal, and was in practice retired to the governorship of Nyborg Slot, and the amtmannship of Nyborg amt.Liljefalk, A.

The organization maintains two historic structures: The Custer-Sharp House and the Middle Town School House. The organization, originally titled the Londonderry Historical Society, was founded in 1971 by local residents who wished to study the history of the town and surrounding area. The Society was originally located inside the town office, opening a small \\"Londonderry Historical Museum\\" in 1983. Upon the death of local artist Bernadine Custer Sharp in 1991, the society was bequeathed the artist's mid-1800s farmhouse; Bernadine asked for her house to be used as a local center for the arts. In 1992, the Society began an extensive renovation on the farmhouse, eventually moving its collection to the Custer-Sharp House. In 2013, the organization changed its name from the Londonderry Historical Society to the Londonderry Arts and Historical Society to better reflect their revised mission upon Bernadine's donation. The Society's collection contains nearly 3,000 works on paper by the artist Bernadine Custer Sharp as well as other local artists such as her husband Arthur \\"Jimmy\\" Sharp and Harry Shokler.

The identity of the subject, an elderly clergyman, is unknown. It is owned by the Redwood Library and Athenaeum (Identifier: PA.125), Newport, Rhode Island, USA, where it hangs. De Ville was a Dutch painter of portraits and still lifes, born in Amsterdam and active in England. Only one other known painting by de Ville (a still life) survives. Description The portrait is of an older male European seen in 3/4-length view. He is standing and turned slightly to his right. His left hand rests on a large book, probably the Bible. He has light hair and blue eyes and wears a white clerical collar and a black cassock. To left of the breast is the inscription ‚ÄúAetatis [i.e., aged] 59‚Äù. There are clear dates in two places, both 1639. The artist's signature is on the paper by the head of a gavel. History and possible subject identities The portrait may have been owned at one time by local Rhode Island historian Stephen Randall (1793‚Äì1874), who took special interest in his ancestor Roger Williams (ca. 1603‚Äì1683), the Puritan, Baptist, and founder of Providence Plantations. Randall may have gifted it to Redwood. In 1927, Providence artist Wilfred Duphinney suggested that the subject may in fact be Roger Williams himself. Wilber Cheesman Nelson was the author of a 95-page booklet on John Clarke (1609‚Äì1676), one of the founders of Portsmouth and Newport, Rhode Island.Nelson, Wilber Cheesman (1938), The Hero of Aquidneck: A Life of Dr. John Clarke; Fleming H. Revell. He popularized the notion in 1938 that it is a portrait of Clarke, a physician and Baptist minister, and this has been the popular choice ever since. Clarke biographer Louis Franklin Asher (d. 1996) even featured the portrait on the dust cover of his 1997 book. There is no evidence, however, for either of these two identifications. The subject of the painting is indicated as being 59 years old in 1639 and would, therefore, have been born about 1580, thereby ruling out both Williams and Clarke. Asher proposes that the dates on the painting are a mistake for 1659, but he advances no rationale for how such a curious double error could have come about.Asher, Louis Franklin (1997), John Clarke (1609‚Äì1676): Pioneer in American Medicine, Democratic Ideals, and Champion of Religious Liberty; Dorrance Pub Co.

Mills Goodloe, based on the 2011 novel of the same name by Charles Martin. It stars Idris Elba and Kate Winslet as a surgeon and a journalist, respectively, who survive a plane crash, with a dog, and are stranded in High Uintas Wilderness with injuries and harsh weather conditions. The film premiered on September 9, 2017, at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 6, 2017, by 20th Century Fox. Plot After their flight is canceled due to stormy weather, neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Bass (Idris Elba) and photojournalist Alex Martin (Kate Winslet) hire private pilot Walter (Beau Bridges) to get them to Denver for connecting flights to Alex's wedding in New York and Ben's emergency surgery appointment in Baltimore. Walter, who has not filed a flight plan, suffers a fatal stroke mid-flight, and the plane crashes on a mountaintop in the High Uintas Wilderness. Ben, Alex, and Walter's dog survive the crash but Alex has injured her leg quite badly. Ben straps her knee up, and buries the pilot while she is unconscious. Once conscious, Alex thinks Ben has a better chance of finding help if he leaves her behind, but Ben refuses. Stranded for days with dwindling supplies, Alex grows skeptical that they will be rescued, although Ben wants to wait for help by the plane's wreckage. Ben agrees to climb a ridge to see if there is any sign of a road. He sees nothing but mountains and barely survives falling down the side. Alex goes through Ben's things and listens to a message from his wife saying, 'I'm glad to have had this time with you'. Alex is found by a cougar who attacks the dog. She sets off a flare and scares the big cat away; it dies. The dog returns. Later, Ben comes back and tends to the dog‚Äôs wounds. They are able to cook and eat the cougar giving them, Ben thinks, ten days of food. The two argue over waiting for rescue or descending the mountain to find a phone signal. Alex starts a lone descent down the mountain. Ben catches up, having located the tail end of the plane he finds a beacon - but it is smashed. The two hike down to the tree-line and spend the night in a cave. Using her telephoto lens, Alex thinks she sees a cabin. Alex falls into freezing water near an abandoned cabin. Alex remains unconscious and severely dehydrated. Ben saves her life by fashioning an IV. They stay there for several days while Alex recuperates, and eventually they have sex. Ben reveals that his wife died two years prior from a brain tumor. As Ben sleeps, Alex takes his picture. Later, she again asks Ben to leave her behind to find help. Ben initially agrees but soon returns; they press forward again. The dog alerts them to a nearby timber yard. On their way toward it, Ben's leg gets caught in a bear trap. Alex cannot free him, but she reaches the yard and collapses in front of an approaching truck. Ben awakens in a hospital and goes to Alex's room, where he finds her with Mark (Dermot Mulroney), her fianc√©. After a brief discussion, Ben leaves heartbroken. Some time after, Mark discovers Alex is no longer in love with him. Ben and Alex go their separate ways after the hospital, with Ben keeping the dog. Alex tries calling Ben, but he ignores her calls until she sends him pictures of them on the mountain, writing that only he can understand them. This encourages Ben to call Alex. They meet at a restaurant, where it is revealed that Alex is now a part-time teacher, and Ben is a consultant at trauma clinics because his frostbitten hands will not recover sufficiently for him to perform surgery again. Ben says he did not call Alex because he thought she would be married; Alex says she could not go through with it because she fell in love with Ben. After leaving the restaurant, Ben admits to Alex that they survived because they fell in love. Alex dismisses her feelings and reminds Ben of something he said on the mountain: \\"the heart is just a muscle.\\" She tells him she doesn‚Äôt know how they could be together in the real world. They hug goodbye, and begin to depart in opposite directions. While walking away both characters become distraught, and finally turn and begin running back to each other. A split second before the two embrace, the screen cuts to black and the credits roll.

Mills Goodloe. In August 2012, Scott Frank was hired to re-write the script. In November 2014, Hany Abu-Assad replaced Naranjo, and Chris Weitz was later hired to re-write the script. Abu-Assad has said of the film, \\"I really didn‚Äôt see an epic love story against the background of survival, I think optimism and hope is crucial to survive. And to go on with your life even if you‚Äôve had a lot of bad luck. So if you give (in) to the bad luck, you will die. (But) if you fight the bad luck, you have a better chance to survive and make your life better. This is very simple wisdom, yes? But still very crucial especially in these kind of days, when everybody feels entitled to their good luck.\\" =Casting= The film went through several lead casting changes. In March 2012, it was announced that Michael Fassbender would star as Bass, but by September 2014, Fassbender dropped out due to a scheduling conflict, and Charlie Hunnam replaced him. Margot Robbie also came on board to star as Alex. In November 2014, Robbie dropped out of the project, and Rosamund Pike entered negotiations for the lead role. In December 2015, both Hunnam and Pike dropped out. In February 2016, Idris Elba came on board, followed by Kate Winslet in June 2016. Dermot Mulroney joined the cast as Winslet's character's fianc√© in early February 2017. =Filming= Principal photography started on December 5, 2016, in Vancouver, and continued until February 24, 2017. Elba and Winslet filmed scenes at the Vancouver International Airport and Abbotsford International Airport on December 7, 2016. Filming stopped for Christmas holidays, from December 20, 2016 to January 3, 2017. Filming resumed around Invermere and Panorama Mountain Village on January 4, 2017. Most of the filming took place in Canada, on the border of Alberta and British Columbia. Abu-Assad has described the locations as having very cold temperatures, and tough and harsh filming conditions. Many scenes were shot on a mountaintop, and he and the crew had to drive 40 minutes before reaching the film's base camp. When the weather was okay, they could board the helicopter to reach their destination along with their supplies. Music German-Iranian composer Ramin Djawadi composed & conducted the music for the film. The official trailer for the movie was released with \\"Dusk Till Dawn\\" by Zayn Malik and Sia Furler as the official soundtrack. The score from the film is now released at Lakeshore Records. Soundtrackdreams reviewed, 'The main theme from ‚ÄúThe mountain between us‚Äù is the best advertisement for this score; a sweeping piano and violin theme, both grandiose and intimate in the same time, a proper drama opening that gets emotional from the first minutes without an adjustment period. The first cue is the kind of piece that could have very well sat at the end as the dramatic climax of the movie. The horn buildup towards the end joins the rolling piano in making sure this theme will end up as one of the most memorable he has every written. Releases The film premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, on September 9, 2017. The film was initially set for release in the United States on October 20, 2017 but was later moved up to October 6, 2017. =Box office= , The Mountain Between Us has grossed $30.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $30.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $62.3 million, against a production budget of $35 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Blade Runner 2049 and My Little Pony: The Movie, and was expected to gross $11‚Äì12 million from 3,088 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up debuting to $10.1 million, finishing second at the box office, behind Blade Runner 2049 ($32.5 million). The film dropped 47% in its second weekend, making $5.7 million and falling to 5th. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 38%, based on 170 reviews, with an average rating of 5.11/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Mountain Between Us may be too far-fetched for some viewers to appreciate, but it's elevated by reliably engaging performances from Idris Elba and Kate Winslet.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as \\"an easily digestible love story-cum-survival tale that tosses two excellent actors in the snow and lets them do their thing,\\" before concluding that \\"what really helps Mountain overcome its far-fetched scenario is the pairing of Winslet and Elba, who know how to turn up the charm tenfold yet make Alex and Ben seem (mostly) like real people.\\" Tim Grierson of ScreenDaily noted that the film \\"struggles to balance its life-or-death stakes with its far more florid love story,\\" but added that \\"the considerable chemistry between Kate Winslet and Idris Elba certainly helps sell this tearjerker.\\" In his review for Variety, Peter Debruge described it as \\"a movie in which neither the subzero temperature nor the romantic heat penetrates more than skin deep.\\" Also criticising the film, Steve Pond of TheWrap found it unnecessarily lengthy and said that \\"a love story cheapens the grand survival story.\\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club criticized the central characters as \\"a couple of one-note personality-test types\\" with \\"zero romantic chemistry,\\" and wrote that the script \\"actually tones down the howling outrageousness of Martin‚Äôs novel, which seems to miss the point.

It represents the only member of the genus Rhodopetala and of its subfamily, Rhodopetaleinae. It is native to the Kuril, Aleutian, and Kodiac Islands. Its diet consists of coralline and laminarian algae. They extend from the Triassic period to the recent.  Taxonomy  Taxonomic characteristics of this species have been debated. In 1981, following the first examination of the soft body parts of a specimen (previous classifications had relied solely on shell characteristics), Lindberg proposed the creation of a new subfamily within the Acmaeidae to be called \\"Rhodopetaleinae\\" with this species as its only member. It is distinguished from the other subfamilies of this family by its helcioniform rather than conical shell, a silvery metallic luster in its central area rather than a porcelaneous quality, and the presence of a rudimentary gill lacking ctenidial structures. It is the combination of the shell structure (patellid) and anatomy (acmaeid) which suggest this is an intermediary group between the acmaeid and cellanid limpets.

The school closed in 2006 due to a fall in the number of students. Based on answers to an Internet questionnaire, the park was made a sports and disaster-prevention location. The park contains a memorial plaque to Nagasaki Junior High School. Facilities There is a sports center, football (soccer) pitch (multipurpose square), open space with a lawn, and in summer there is a small fountain and water area (called Jabu-Jabu Ike (Splashing Pond)). There is play equipment for children including swings and slides. As a disaster- prevention facility, the park has a water-sampling port, a manhole that can serve as a temporary toilet, and a bench that can be used as a small oven. The park also offers access to existing disaster-prevention wells and fire- prevention water tanks.

The mission was founded by the Scudder family including John Scudder Sr. (1793-1855) in 1851 in order to provide medical help and convert the Indians to Christianity. Through to the Indian Independence period, the Ascot mission was known for tis medical care as well as the successful conversion to Christianity of many Indians. Background In 1819, John and Harriet Scudder arrived in India to start missionaries. Many years later in April 1846, the Scudders were asked to go to work at the newly established Madura Mission of the American Board. At the time, there was a cholera epidemic and the Scudders were the only physicians available. This began the start of the Arcot Mission of the Reformed Church. In 1851, the Arcot mission was approved for establishment and then it was only organized in 1853. From 1853 until 1857 the mission was administered by the ABCFM. Henry Martyn Scudder the eldest son of the Scudders, was the person who established the mission along with two of his brothers. Him, along with his wife moved to the North Arcot District and started a dispensary to both help the people and also to win their favor. The mission was a test to see missionaries can be run and started by members of the same family. If it worked or failed, it would set a precedent for other missionaries.From Mission to Church: The Reformed Church in America Mission to IndiaAmerican Arcot Mission Report (hereafter \\"AAR\\"), 1854, 6-7 Mission At one time the mission included 16 missionaries, 460 Indian agents, 114 non-Christian teachers, 2,305 communicants, and 10,060 Christians.3\\\\. Life in the Churches: American Zionists Tent Meeting The Arcot‚Ä¶ The mission had multiple fundamentals to its existence including, \\"The preaching of the Gospel\\", \\"The preparation and extensive diffusion of Vernacular Tracts and Books\\", and \\"The education of those who join us\\". The missionary must preach to everyone in order to have the masses convert to Christianity. Arcot must also fuse both the Christian views with the Hindus. Issues in the Missionary A major issue, specific to India was the caste system. When people converted to Christianity they refused to give up their caste, especially if they were in a high caste. There were so many issues that in order to resolve this issue they set guidelines for people wishing to convert. This included that people needed to renounce the use of castes forever and the person had to renounce their caste again before they went to Communion (Page 34 of From Mission to Church). These rules became one of the utmost important policies of the Arcot Mission and were strictly followed. Women's Roles in the Missionary When the Arcot Mission was founded, women were not able to be missionaries. Therefore, the founding member of the mission are only men. Officially, Henry Martyn Scudder, William Waterbury Scudder, and Joseph Scudder are the founding members of the missionary. Their wives, however, played equally important role in the founding.Women Missionaries in India: Opening Up the Restrictive Policies of Rufus Anderson Legacy \\"The mission built up an indigenous church in which the Indians had full membership and equality. Francis Clark, president of Christian Endeavor, visited Arcot. By 1950, the mission claimed to have 35,000 converted Indians. With its independence granted in 1947, India put restraints on missionary activities. The collection consists of books, booklets, brochures, magazine articles, maps, pamphlets, and reports.\\"4\\\\.

Kunjah, d. c. 1695 CE) was a Persian- language poet in the Mughal Empire. He belongs to the Banu Hashim family. One of his ancestors was Ali's son Imam Abu al-Qasim Muhammad bin Hanffiyah (Alvi.Hashmi), but he used the Kunjahi name in the first half of the seventeenth century CE. Life Most of Kunjahi's life was spent in and around his native village. He traveled to, and stayed in, Kashmir, Delhi and Lahore. He was an adherent of the ·∏≤ƒÅdiriyya, a Sufi order. Works Kunjahi wrote in Persian, in the style known as sabk-i hindƒ´, the so-called 'Indian style'. This style was characterised by an enthusiasm for the ghazal form; an increased interest in realistic images, often in erotic themes; conceptual complexity of images and themes; and complex syntax. It has been suggested that Kunjahi's 'fondness for lengthy compound expressions echoes the enormous compound epithets of Sanskrit poetry of the KƒÅvya style, especially as G _h_ anƒ´mat‚Äôs century was one of considerable Muslim-Hindu cultural interaction, in which, for instance, several Sanskrit works were translated into Persian at the Mug _h_ al court'. Kunjahi's diwan is dominated by ghazals, including a poem of praise, Aurangzeb, along with the Nayrang-i  øish·∏≥ ('Talisman of Love'), from 1681 CE. This is a sentimental, sensuous romantic poem in mathnawƒ´ form , set in the India of Kunjahi's day, characterized by 'mystical and symbolical overtones'. Reception The Nayrang-i  øish·∏≥ was translated into Pashto around 1600 by  øAbd al-Hamƒ´d Mohmand.Da Hamƒ´d Nayrang-i ‚Äòishq, ed. by Siddƒ´q AllƒÅh Rishtƒ´n (Kabul, 1970). By the mid-twentieth century, Kunjahi had 'come to maintain a dim afterlife in popular local memory only as a miracle worker with some notable but minor specialist powers of the kind attributed to the lesser sort of departed Sufi saint, all over the Muslim world'. His tomb was associated with improving mental faculties, curing insanity and helping aspiring poets.}} Kunjahi gave his name to the Bazm-i- Ghanimat, a Pakistani literary organization. By his own request, the Pakistani poet Shareef Kunjahi (1914‚Äì2007) was interred in the compound of Kunjahi's mazar in Kunjah.Sharif Kunjahi laid to rest. Dawn (newspaper). 22 January 2007.

It was one of the largest gatherings of European royalty ever to take place. Description In 1897, Victoria had written instructions for her funeral, which was to be military as befitting a soldier's daughter and the head of the army, and white instead of black.Hibbert, p. 497; Longford, p. 563 On 25 January, her body was lifted into the coffin by her sons Edward VII and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and her grandson the German Emperor Wilhelm II.St Aubyn, p. 598 She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil.Longford, p. 563 An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. A dressing gown that had belonged to her husband Albert who had died 40 years earlier, was placed by her side, along with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers.Hibbert, p. 498 Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883.Matthew, H. C. G.; Reynolds, K. D. (2004; online edition October 2009) \\"Victoria (1819‚Äì1901)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, , retrieved 18 October 2010 (subscription required for online access) Her funeral was held on Saturday, 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in the Royal Mausoleum at Frogmore at Windsor Great Park.Longford, p. 565; St Aubyn, p. 600 Westminster Abbey. Special Service To be held on the occasion of the Funeral of Her Late Majesty Queen Victoria, Saturday, February 2nd, 1901, At Two o'clock. Order of Service The state funeral of Queen Victoria took place in February 1901; it had been 64 years since the last burial of a monarch. Victoria left strict instructions regarding the service and associated ceremonies and instituted a number of changes, several of which set a precedent for state (and indeed ceremonial) funerals that have taken place since. First, she disliked the preponderance of funereal black; henceforward, there would be no black cloaks, drapes or canopy, and Victoria requested a white pall for her coffin. Second, she expressed a desire to be buried as \\"a soldier's daughter\\". The procession, therefore, became much more a military procession, with the peers, privy counsellors and judiciary no longer taking part en masse. Her pallbearers were equerries rather than dukes (as had previously been customary), and for the first time, a gun carriage was employed to convey the monarch's coffin. Third, Victoria requested that there should be no public lying in state. This meant that the only event in London on this occasion was a gun carriage procession from one railway station to another: Victoria having died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, her body was conveyed by boat and train to Waterloo Station, then by gun carriage to Paddington Station and then by train to Windsor for the funeral service itself. The Passing of a Great Queen; painting by William WyllieWyllie depicts a scene during the funeral of Queen Victoria. The royal yacht, HMY Alberta, carrying the Queen's body, arrives in Gosport in the late afternoon of 1 February 1901, with the setting sun behind her. The royal standard flies at half-mast, and surrounding the small vessel are several escorting destroyers. In the background the anchored battleships fire salutes. Following behind the Alberta is the larger royal yacht HMY Victoria and Albert, flying the royal standard and carrying King Edward VII and other royal mourners. The funeral procession The rare sight of a state funeral cort√®ge travelling by ship provided a striking spectacle: Victoria's body was carried on board HMY Alberta from Cowes to Gosport, with a suite of yachts following conveying the new king, Edward VII, and other mourners. Minute guns were fired by the assembled fleet as the yacht passed by. Victoria's body remained on board ship overnight before being conveyed by gun carriage to the railway station the following day for the train journey to London. Victoria broke convention by having a white draped coffin. Victoria's children had married into the great royal families of Europe and a number of foreign monarchs were in attendance including Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany as well as the heir to the Austro- Hungarian throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Vacancy The vacancy resulted from the death of the sitting member, David Pugh, who had held the seat since it was formed in 1885. Selection of Liberal Candidate David Pugh had announced his intention not to seek re-election some weeks before his death. Therefore moves to select a new candidate were already in place when the vacancy occurred. On July, delegates from the various branches of the Liberal Party on the division met at Llandeilo and it was decided that a series of meetings would be held throughout the constituency to allow the electors to hear the candidates. A large number of candidates were proposed, including Alfred Davies, R.D. Burnie, and the well-known local doctor, Howell Rees. A number of meetings were subsequently held which gave the candidates an opportunity to address the electors. Within a few days all had withdrawn with the exception of Gwilym Evans and the Swansea-based lawyer, Abel Thomas. It appeared that Evans was largely supported by the more industrialised parts of the community while Thomas drew most support from the rural areas. At these meetings, both candidates expressed support for the mainstream Liberal policies of the day. However, it also became clear from these meetings that there were differences between the candidates. Evans addressed the first meeting at Llandovery predominantly using the Welsh language, which invited a contrast with his opponent's limited knowledge of Welsh. As a result, Thomas felt compelled at a subsequent meeting at Llandeilo to appeal that his lack of fluency in Welsh should not be held to support his opponent. Evans placed himself firmly in the radical camp, supporting Home Rule. emphasizing his prominent role as a member of Carmarthenshire County Council, and stating that he would follow in the footsteps of Mabon, David Randell and Tom Ellis. Thomas, in contrast expressed himself to be an opponent of Home Rule for Wales. It may well have been that popular momentum would have been behind Gwilym Evans, not least because of his well-known reputation as producer of his famous 'Quinine Bitters'. However, a number of questions were raised about his candidature. It was stated that he owned half a dozen public houses in the constituency. There were claims that he had publicly supported a Conservative candidate, John Jones, at the General Election of 1880. Evans countered by giving his own full version of the episode and stating that Jones had assisted him in gaining a public office. However, more recently it was stated that Evans had opposed the Association in 1886 and taken up a position akin to a Liberal Unionist over Irish Home Rule. On 29 July, some three hundred delegates from throughout the constituency gathered at Ammanford to select a candidate. The proceedings were dominated by debates about the eligibility of various delegates to vote but eventually it was agreed to proceed on the basis of the credentials provided for those delegates in attendance. Abel Thomas was selected as Liberal candidate, defeating Gwilym Evans by 170 votes against 121. It was felt that Evans's flirtation with Liberal Unionism may have proved his undoing. As the Cambrian News stated, Wales is determined to have nothing whatever to do with any candidate who in 1886 went over to the Tories. The Conservatives The Conservatives had run Sir Marteine Lloyd of Bronwydd against Pugh at the 1885 General Election but chose not to contest the seat in 1886. After a meeting held at Llandeilo it was resolved not to contest the by-election. In many ways, as the Carmarthen Journal editorial admitted, this was an indication that the Conservatives considered a fight to be hopeless, especially as no preparations had been made. The Result Abel Thomas was therefore declared elected unopposed, being formally nominated at Llandeilo by J.W. Gwynne Hughes of Tregib and the Rev. William Davies.

John Steely, a real estate broker, and Lewis Lichty, an attorney who owned the Waterloo Canning Company, bought the property known as sandhill in 1901, and opened an office for the Highland Land Company in the Century Building in 1905. The historic district is all residential buildings. The oldest house predates the development having been built in 1900. Otherwise construction began in the center of the district in 1908 and moved outward. By 1942 all but 15 houses were built. They are all frame construction with exteriors composed of wood, stucco, brick and stone. Styles popular in the district include Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival and American Craftsman. Waterloo architect Mortimer B. Cleveland is responsible for designing at least 39 of the houses here. Chicago landscape architect Howard Evarts Weed designed the Square and boulevard plantings.

Dennise Trajano serves as JAM Liner's President and CEO as well as Philtranco Services Enterprises, Incorporated.  Etymology  The name JAM Liner came from the first letter of its founders', Josefina Mercado and her husband, Artemio Mercado, first name and surname. Thus and .  History  JAM Liner was started on April 7, 1968 by Artemio Mercado and his wife, Josefina Mercado with only four buses. They initially served the Bi√±an, Laguna to Manila route. By then, the Mercados expanded their bus transport business in Laguna. It came to the point that around 30 percent of the province's transportation services were theirs. In 1990, they increase their bus network to the provinces of Quezon, Batangas, Camarines Sur, Albay and Sorsogon. They had grown their franchises to around 290 bus units. However, in 2000, the Jose ‚ÄúPepito‚Äù Ch. Alvarez-led Penta Pacific Realty Corporation took over the management. Chavez integrated JAM Liner's operations with Philtranco Services Enterprises, Inc., a bus company that Penta Pacific also bought out in 1999. Despite the integration of these two bus companies, JAM Liner and Philtranco run by their own set of company structures, management and subsidiaries. JAM Liner is operated under JAM Group of Companies with their subsidiaries: JAM Liner, JAM Transit, Phil Tourister and First Charters and Tours Transport Corporation; while Philtranco Services Enterprises Inc. has its own subsidiaries: Philtranco, Phikargo, and Amihan Bus Lines. The company was later headed by its president and CEO, Dennise Trajano. JAM Liner, along with Philtranco became innovative in their ticketing services with their ventures to VMoney, and Smart's Pinoy Travel. In 2013, The Dawn composed and perform their company theme song entitled \\"JAM Tayo\\" (Tagalog: Let's Jam). In 2015, JAM Liner had a joint venture with SM Investments Corporation in expanding their operations to Cebu. The joint venture formed the Metro Rapid Transit Service Inc. or known as \\"Cebu MyBus\\". A bus rapid transit system with services within SM Seaside City, SM City Cebu, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, to key cities along Metro Cebu and vice versa. It was JAM Liner's first expansion to Visayas and one of their biggest attempt in the region which is predominated by the country's largest, Yanson Group of Bus Companies. In 2016, JAM Liner along with QRS Logistics and University of the Philippines had their own basketball team for the PBA Developmental League as UP-QRS-JAM. Majority of their team members are from UP Maroons who played for UAAP Basketball Games. In March, JAM Liner along with their alliances Philtranco and FastCat unveiled their modernization program in aiming to link Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Accordingly, Philtranco and JAM Liner envisioned having a fleet of 1000 with FastCat as their partner in sea to expand their road network, nationwide.

These included many Jewish children threatened by the Holocaust and rescued in the operation known as the Kindertransport. In 2010, she was recognised as a British Hero of the Holocaust. Early life and education Her father worked for the Quaker chocolate maker, Cadbury, in their model village of Bournville. Her mother was Annie n√©e Miles. She went to Birmingham University and, after graduating, she worked in personnel and as a teacher for five years. Quaker relief work She joined the Society of Friends ‚Äì the Quakers ‚Äì when she was about eighteen. In 1921, she left teaching to work at the Quaker Centre in Vienna where she founded and operated youth clubs. She enjoyed singing with young people and her work in these centres gave her good fluency in the German language and a network of many contacts. The Quaker International Centres had been conceived by Carl Heath in 1916 and eight of them were established across Europe after the First World War. After Vienna, Bracey moved to Germany where the hyperinflation and instability of the Weimar Republic caused great hardship. At the centres in Nuremberg and then Berlin, she organised aid for the population, especially children. The provision of food to the impoverished and starving was known as the Qu√§kerspeisung ‚Äì the Quaker feeding ‚Äì and it so endeared the Quakers to the German people that it enabled them to aid refugees during the Nazi era. In 1929, she became an Administrative Secretary of the Germany and Holland Committee in the Quaker headquarters in London, responsible for the relief operations in Germany and Holland. In 1933, she took charge of the newly-formed German Emergency Committee and this was later renamed as the Friends Committee for Refugees and Aliens. As the work expanded, her staff in Friends House grew from a single assistant to 59 case- workers in 1938 and, with crowds of refugees to process, they overflowed into Drayton House nearby. Schools She helped found the Stoatley Rough School for German refugees in Haslemere in England. This started when Hilde Lion contacted the German Emergency Committee in 1933 with plans to form a school to help German children adjust to British education. Bracey chaired the board of governors from 1938 to 1945 and continued as a governor of the school until 1960. In 1934, she helped establish a school for German Jewish children in the castle of Eerde in Holland. Kindertransport Bracey had recognised the threat to the Jews of Germany in 1933, after Hitler became Chancellor and the Nazi party took control, \\"Words are not adequate to tell of the anguish of some of my Jewish friends\\". After the great pogrom of Kristallnacht in 1938, she visited Berlin and was then part of the delegation which met with the British Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare to convince him to expedite the acceptance of Jewish children as refugees from Germany. She then led the Quaker team which formed part of the Movement for the Care of Children from Germany. Initially, they were based in Friends House but this was overcrowded and so the Palace Hotel in Bloomsbury Street was bought to become Bloomsbury House ‚Äì a centre for all the refugee organisations to work together. Bracey became secretary of the Inter-Church Council for German Refugees and led a team of 80 Quaker case-workers on the third floor. During the war, she took on further duties. In 1940, after the fall of France caused concern about the security risk of having German refugees in Britain resulting in internment, she led the Central Department for Interned Refugees which addressed the practical and humanitarian issues arising from this policy. At the end of the war, she was still saving children. For example, in 1945, she arranged for the RAF to fly 300 orphans from Theresienstadt concentration camp to a reception centre by Windermere. Later life In the aftermath of the war, there were many displaced persons so she joined the Allied Control Commission to handle refugees in Germany. Later she was made responsible for women's affairs in the American and British Zones of Occupation. She then retired from this post in 1953, having reached the age of 60. In the 1960s she moved to a flat in Langton Green, near Tunbridge Wells, in the block next door to her sister Emily. Later she moved to East House in Adderbury, near Banbury where she ended her days. In her nineties she suffered from a tremor, at one stage thought to be Parkinson's disease though in fact it was not. She remained cheerful, alert and an inspiration to others. During a visit in her last years, she told her great nephew, Nick Bamford, the story of how she used to take false papers to the Jews she was helping to escape from Germany in the 30s. Knowing that if she were caught with these she would be arrested and in serious trouble, her strategy was to play up the role of a slightly dotty, middle-aged schoolmistress by approaching every man in uniform and asking \\"Do I need to show you my papers?\\". She was quickly hurried on and so her mission was accomplished. Awards and memorials In 1942, she was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to refugees. In 1999, a rose was dedicated to her at the Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre. In 2010, she was recognised as a British Hero of the Holocaust by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Naomi Blake, who was herself a survivor of Auschwitz, sculpted a statue dedicated to Bertha Bracey and it is now on display in Friends House.

Kubiak is an American inorganic chemist, currently a Distinguished Professor in Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Harold C. Urey Chair in Chemistry at the University of California, San Diego. Over the course of his career, Kubiak has published over 200 scientific articles. He has also received the American Chemical Society Award in Inorganic Chemistry, and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and American Chemical Society. In 2020 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/five-uc-san-diego-professors-elected- national-academy-sciences Early life and education Kubiak grew up in Connecticut, and displayed an interest in chemistry from an early age. In 1975, Kubiak received his bachelor's degree with honors in chemistry from Brown University. He also received a Ph. D. in chemistry from the University of Rochester in 1980, where he was a Sherman Clarke Fellow and an Elon Huntington Hooker Fellow.  Career  After receiving his Ph. D., Kubiak performed postdoctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Mark S. Wrighton, where he worked from 1980 to 1981. In 1982, Kubiak joined the faculty of Purdue University as an assistant professor; in 1987, he became an associate professor, before becoming a full professor in 1990. During this time, he was also named the Robert A. Wheland Visiting Professor at the University of Chicago in 1997. In 1998, Kubiak left Purdue University and moved to the University of California, San Diego as the Harold C. Urey Endowed Chair Professor in Chemistry. During his time at UCSD, he has also held the position of Chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry from 2002 to 2006, and was named Distinguished Professor in Chemistry and Biochemistry in 2008. In 2012, he was also appointed to the position of Visiting Associate in Chemistry at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP) at the California Institute of Technology. He was also an Invited Visiting Professor of electrocatalysis at the Paris Diderot University in 2014, and has been appointed to additional visiting positions at Tohoku University and the University of Erlangen. Kubiak has also served on the editorial advisory boards of several publications, such as Accounts of Chemical Research, Inorganic Chemistry, and Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing.  Research  The Kubiak Research Group at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Graduate Program in Materials Science and Engineering currently studies the reduction of carbon dioxide by means of electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. In addition, his team has expanded research regarding electron-transfer reactions, which can be used in the advancement of molecular electronic devices. = Contributions to nanoscience = Kubiak was involved in the research of nanoscience, with a focus on self- assembled monolayers, from its early days in the 1990s. His work in this field has included research into gold nanoclusters and molecular conductivity.  Gold nanoparticles  Electron transfer between discrete Ru3O clusters through gold nanoparticles, as pictured, is ultrafast. Among the properties of gold nanoparticles (or NPs) is their conductivity, allowing ultrafast electron transfer. In 2005, Kubiak, along with Gabriele Canzi, used gold NPs to generate a picosecond ground-state electron transfer reaction, marking the first time such a reaction had been performed. This ground-state electron transfer allowed for the accurate measurement of the resistances of individual carbon-based molecules. In 2005, J. Catherine Salsman, Tasuku Ito, and Kubiak energetically distinguished the conductive properties of gold nanoclusters and individual molecules by labeling the structures isotopically, and utilized infrared spectroscopy to observe asymmetry.  Molecular self-assembly  In 1997, Kubiak and colleagues theoretically calculated the current-voltage properties of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of organic polymers. Such properties depend on the equilibrium Fermi energy and the voltage division factor, Ef and Œ∑ respectively, as determined by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). = Carbon dioxide fixation = In 2014, Kubiak and his colleagues from the University of California, San Diego determined the efficiency of an alternate ReI(bpy) catalyst complex pathway, an assembled supramolecular system, which can assist in the reduction of CO2. Later, his group also lead the work on replacing the scarce Re to the more abundant Mn in the catalyst for CO2 reduction. It was seen that the reduction of byproduct CO2, driven by solar power, wind, or electricity generated by running water, can produce fuels by means of a carbon-neutral energy cycle.  Non-scientific pursuits  In addition to his work in the scientific community, Kubiak has also served as the Faculty Athletics Representative for the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics at the University of California, San Diego, a position he has held since 2007. It is in this capacity that Kubiak received the Athletic Department's Meritorious Service Award in June 2013. He also chairs the Faculty Athletic Board of Advisors at the same university.  Personal life  Kubiak is married, and currently resides with his wife in Del Mar, California.  Controversies  In May 2011, a University of California, San Diego web page attributed to Kubiak was criticized for its use of a racial slur, specifically one targeting people of East Asian descent, as part of a list of ‚Äúlab rules‚Äù supposedly meant to be humorous. The web page was subsequently removed by UCSD officials; additionally, a statement was issued by Suresh Subramani and Mark Thiemens, respectively the executive vice chancellor for academic affairs and the dean of physical sciences at UCSD, offering an apology for Kubiak's actions. Kubiak himself issued an apology as well, claiming that he had no knowledge of the slur's presence on his website but accepting full responsibility regardless. Awards and honors In 2012, Kubiak was awarded the American Chemical Society Award in Inorganic Chemistry. In addition to this prestigious award, he has also received a number of other awards and honors, including the following: = Awards = * 1989: Frank D.

Hosted by Chris Thile, it aired live on Saturday evenings. The show's home was at the Town Hall in New York City, though initially it was at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota. The show debuted in its new home in the 2019-2020 season at The Town Hall, with its broadcast on September 7, 2019. The show was derived from the historic A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor (APHC) radio show. The original host, Garrison Keillor, performed his final show in July 2016, and Thile's program began on October 15, 2016. Thile, an American virtuoso mandolinist and singer-songwriter, had a two-decade history with APHC and is known for his work in the folk and progressive bluegrass groups Nickel Creek and Punch Brothers. After two unprecedented guest host spots in 2015, Keillor decided on his successor, featured Thile as host again in January‚ÄìFebruary 2016, and fully ceded his hosting role to Thile in the October 2016 performance at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, continuing as the show's Executive Producer. Thile's new program presented expanded musical and comedic elements, retaining the template of the earlier program (e.g., its then present acting and sound effect cast, and \\"sponsorships\\" from fictitious companies), but without such features as its earlier signatures \\"Lives of the Cowboys\\" series and \\"News from Lake Wobegon\\" monologue. American Public Media announced after the June 13, 2020 broadcast that due to \\"financial challenges and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic,\\" they had canceled the show effective immediately. APM did not allow the show a series finale. Program host Chris Thile, born in 1981, is an American virtuoso mandolinist and singer-songwriter known for his folk and progressive bluegrass work in the trio Nickel Creek and the quintet Punch Brothers. A child prodigy in music‚Äîself-described as \\"begging [his] parents for a mandolin from the time [he] was 2\\" and picking up the mandolin for the first time at the age of 5‚ÄîThile was one of a trio, with siblings Sara and Sean Watkins, home-schooled California children from musical backgrounds, who formed the group Nickel Creek with Thile's father in 1989. An acoustic group, it continues as a trio to the present day (2016), with Thile's participation alongside his more recent acoustic quintet Punch Brothers, both variously described using terms such as folk, progressive, bluegrass, \\"newgrass,\\" and roots music. Thile was awarded BBC's Folk Musician of the Year award in 2007, a MacArthur Fellowship \\"genius\\" award in 2012, and eight Grammy Award nominations, four of which he won for Best Album in 1997, 2002, 2013, and 2015 (in the categories of Bluegrass, Contemporary Folk, Folk, and Contemporary Instrumental, respectively). Garrison Keillor has made known his personal opinion, that Thile is \\"the great bluegrass performer of our time.\\" As well, others have observed that \\"[t]hough charming and cheery, Thile is by nature deeply competitive,\\" and understands the business side of matters, and that the size of audiences that the show attracts will matter.  History  = History with APHC =  Guest performances  Thile first performed with Garrison Keillor on A Prairie Home Companion in 1996, at age 15. Over the next two decades, Thile returned to APHC eight times (according to the program's website), performing both as a solo artist and as a part of the groups Nickel Creek and Punch Brothers. These guest appearances included performances at the programs home venue, the Fitzgerald Theater, and at tour venues. Programs in which Thile participated that received press coverage or are otherwise sourced and noteworthy appear below. * May 11, 1996‚ÄîAt The Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota. In the Young Artists Showcase, Thile as a 15-year old.The references provided here state 14 years old, while the biography for Thile linked therein indicate 15 years old, as do all other sources cited in this article, and so the 15 years is the age stated. With regulars Tim Russell, Chris Forth, Tom Keith and \\"The Guys All-Star Shoe Band\\" (Richard Dworsky, Andy Stein, Pat Donohue, Greg Hippen, and Arnie Kinsella), and other guests Kate MacKenzie,See the Musicians section at the Radio Songs (album) article. Michael Cleveland, and Seamus Egan and Solas (Karan Casey, John Doyle, Winifred Horan, and John Williams). Thile performed his songs Shadow Ridge (1992), What's the Matter with the Mill? (1996), and Faith River (1996), Keillor's song Greenland Whale Fisheries (1996), traditional and other songs (e.g., by Bill Monroe and MacKenzie) including Stoney Lonesome, Mother the Queen of My Heart (1933), The Sweetest Gift A Mother's Smile, Don't this Road look Rough and Rocky, Wheel Hoss, and The Red River Valley (1879), as well as the Powdermilk Biscuit Theme. See the preceding Note regarding Thile's age at this performance, appearing within this bullet point, above. * June 11, 2016‚ÄîAt the Ravinia Festival, in Highland Park, Illinois. With Punch Brothers. Trial guest hosting Thile as guest host in January 2016 When Keillor announced in November 2014 that he would absent himself from APHC for \\"only the second time in decades,\\" he yielded the host's microphone to Thile for these guest host appearances. Thile began these appearances in 2015 and appeared a total of 4 times in the twelve months thereafter, the final two guest host spots being on January 30 and February 6, 2016. The guest host appearances gave an indication of the type of crew that Thile would assemble, the kinds of guests he would attract, and the style in which he might host (see Format and Cast, below). The hosted programs were on the following dates, and featured the following guest artists: * January 30, 2016, with Thile's fellow Punch Brothers group members, with musical guests Brandi Carlile, Ben Folds and Sarah Jarosz. A special comedy spot was done by comedian Maria Bamford. * February 6, 2016, again with Punch Brothers and Sarah Jarosz, with musical guests Paul Simon and Andrew Bird, with special comedy again from Maria Bamford. Thile also covered Kendrick Lamar's song about police brutality, Alright, to some social media criticism, about which he later said, \\"I would readily admit that my love of the song kind of blinded me,\\" and \\"I think it was a bad call.\\" Thile is described as having \\"test dr[iven]\\" his idea for a newly-penned Song of the Week, with themes \\"tailored to current events,\\" in his performance of \\"Omahallelujah,\\" about Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning during this episode.  Final Keillor program  In 2015, Keillor announced that he would step down from hosting the program and designated Chris Thile as the new host. Keillor's final episode of the show was recorded live on July 1, 2016, at the Hollywood Bowl in California for an audience of 18,000 fans and broadcast the next day. Keillor retained artistic rights and trademark to the show's name as well as some distribution rights and rights to retail items connected with A Prairie Home Companion. Thile made his debut as permanent host on October 15, 2016.  Name change  In November 2017 Minnesota Public Radio severed all business ties with former APHC host Garrison Keillor over unspecified \\"inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.\\" The Minnesota Public Radio website listed the show under the working title The Show with Chris Thile, as the trademark for A Prairie Home Companion is held by Keillor, not MPR. Thile addressed the situation on the December 2 installment of the series, and Thile began using a new theme, \\"Radio Boogie\\". The show aired under the placeholder title of The Show with Chris Thile for the next two Saturdays. Finally, on December 16, Thile announced the show's new name as Live from Here. =New APHC format= Thile has referred to the program that Keillor created as a \\"truly great wor[k] of art\\" and so \\"immortal,\\" so that he would \\"keep using the template [Keillor] created to tell each other stories and to escape from our daily cares. Even so, Andrew Leahy of the Rolling Stone wrote that Thile had added to the mandate of \\"preserving the show's appeal\\" a further one of \\"revising its structure and broadening its reach to younger generations.\\" Hence, the program continues to present a variety of program elements, including music, and storytelling, comedic and otherwise (see following), but Thile has indicated some changes in direction, and others are noted in early reviews. Absent from the new program is the \\"Lives of the Cowboys\\" sketch, and the signature weekly \\"News from Lake Wobegon\\" monologues from Garrison Keillor; still present as of October 2016 are \\"old favorites\\" such as the program's faux sponsorship by Powdermilk Biscuits. As of the opening month of the program, the planned replacement for the Keillor monologue was a slate of appearances from standup comics, for instance, the Irish comedian Maeve Higgins. New music from the host, and expanded music in general, have been noted as features of the new program. Andrew Leahy of Rolling Stone offers as perspective, that Thile has indicated that the musical variety of the premiere program (see below) will continue, with listeners to expect \\"roots-rockers, folksingers, jazz musicians, soul revivalists and bluegrass bands all taking the stage.\\" Cast and crew In addition to Chris Thile, who will contribute originally composed music and performances on his various instruments, the musical and acting cast and crew consists of the following artists: * Bodine Boling, creative director and announcer. * Serena Brook, actress and voice- over artist. * Madison Cunningham, singer and guitarist. * Chris Eldridge, Punch Brothers guitarist. * Mike Elizondo, musician and songwriter. Musical director of Live from Here from September 2018. * Brittany Haas, fiddler. * Alan Hampton, multi-instrumentalist * Greg Hess, writer, performer, and improviser * Sarah Jarosz, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist. * Paul Kowert, Punch Brothers bass player. * Julian Lage, guitarist * Holly Laurent, comic, improviser, writer, and director * Gaby Moreno, vocalist * Aoife O'Donovan, singer-songwriter * Tom Papa, comedian, head writer. * Ted Poor, drummer. * Gabe Witcher, violinist * Mike Yard, comedian =Former members= * Sue Scott, APHC veteran, actress and voice-over artist.

Musical director of A Prairie Home Companion and Live from Here until September 2018. * Tim Russell, APHC veteran, voice actor and impressionist. Left in 2018. Broadcast information Local public radio stations carried the weekly production of Live from Here with Chris Thile at one or more broadcast times, varying by station. The NPR Now channel on SiriusXM Satellite Radio carried the program on Saturdays at 5 p.m. and Sundays at 11 a.m., both Central Time (UTC‚àí6).Central Time is six hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). See The audio of the program also streamed live online, at livefromhere.org on Saturdays from 5 to 7 p.m. Central, and video streams were likewise available when the program broadcasts from their home venue, The Fitzgerald Theater, or their \\"home-away-from-home\\", The Town Hall in New York City. Streaming audio from each show posts following the Saturday broadcast at livefromhere.org, as of March 2018 at noon, Central Time on Sunday. Highlights from the show, including Chris Thile's \\"Song of the Week\\", are available via RSS, iHeartRadio, iTunes, Stitcher, and TuneIn.  Comments on the changeover  In the announcement of the change in host for the program, American Public Media stated: Keillor, who had made various statements regarding retirement in the past, was described in June 2016 as being \\"fairly serious this time,\\" and he is quoted as saying \\"Chris is my man, and I'm eager to stay home and read books.\\" Elaborating further, Keillor wrote to Abe Streep of The New York Times Magazine, indicating that Thile's adventurous nature‚Äîalongside his high esteem for \\"the great bluegrass performer\\"‚Äîwere reasons for his consideration as Keillor's replacement, which would be tested via a trial run of guest host appearances in January‚ÄìFebruary 2016; Keillor wrote, Keillor went on to write about Thile, \\"He takes big chances ... He can be a chameleon, he can swim in every event, and for all his brilliance, nobody sounds better singing old American songs than he. Nobody.\\" Thile, in discussing the changeover with Minnesota Public Radio, indicated that he would continue to write new musical material, as he has in initial programs since his debut as host: \\"I would like to write something new every week ... I've written a new song for each show. I want to keep doing that. It's so much fun.\\" In addition, he has highlighted comedy as an element for the new show, noting the success of appearances of comedian Maria Bamford in shows he had hosted early in 2016 which gave \\"five or six minutes of hilarity.\\" With regard to story telling, he noted the success of an appearance by actor Ed Helms, indicating that the new APHC will \\"have that kind of thing going on.\\" When asked about future on-air material from show originator and current executive producer Garrison Keillor, Thile replied, \\"He's such an amazing writer that if he comes up with an idea that would be good for the show ... I imagine we'll get a script here and there.\\" = APM business strategy = While much media focus during the changeover was on the artistry and styles associated with Keillor and Thile, APHC and American Public Media (APM) are businesses as well; at its peak, the original APHC radio program had garnered in excess of four million weekly listeners, and Rivertown Trading Company, the purveyor of APHC-themed products, was sold in 1998 by Minnesota Public Radio for US $120 million. Sensitive to the potential loss of audience due to the change of the show's hosting‚ÄîThile said that he knew he would lose some listeners devoted to Keillor, stating at the time that \\"[the] goal is to lose one million ... and add two.\\"‚Äîthe program's distributor, American Public Media, indicated its intent to ease listeners completely away from experiencing the earlier Keillor format by \\"mix[ing] in\\" more than a dozen of the new APHC programs with Thile, alongside a set of reruns where Keillor is at the helm.  Critical response  Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Steve Johnson notes that the new program \\"still rel[ies] heavily on an air of authenticity derived from its Minnesota locale, [but] now leans a little more toward music,\\" and \\"away from storytelling.\\" Johnson concludes that the program remains \\"an easy, graceful listen\\" featuring \\"a killer musical repertoire in the Americana tradition,\\" and \\"humor ranging from corny to cutting.\\" Jon Bream of Minneapolis' Star Tribune complimented Thile's musical expertise, especially relative to the more amateur Keillor: \\"Unlike Keillor, Thile is a host who can actually sing duets with authority, not just aspiration\\" as well as suggesting that Thile's connections to popular music would benefit the production, such as to Jack White, who performed on the show. Not all critics have been as certain that the shift in the show's brand has been a good one. Erik Sherman, writing for Inc. This Morning, observed: \\"...brands are fragile and this one just hit the ground and shattered. ...the new name is Live From Here. A more anodyne and empty brand would be difficult to achieve. This is the sort of concoction that a satirist mocking such a production might adopt,\\" and points out that the show's listenership was down to 2.6 million at the end of 2017.

The Troad region in northwestern AnatoliaThe location of Cebrenia was described by Strabo (c. 64 BCE-24 CE) in section 13.1.33 of his Geography: \\"Above them [the coastal cities near Troy] lies the plain of Troy, extending as far as Mount Ida to the east ... The part at the foot of the mountain is narrow ... This country Homer places under the command of Aeneas and the Antenoridae, and calls it Dardania. Below it is Cebrenia, which for the most part consists of plains, and lies nearly parallel to Dardania. There was also formerly a city Cybrene. ... Cebrenia extends as far as the Scepsian district. The boundary is the River Scamander, which runs through the middle of Cebrenia and Scepsia. There was continual enmity and war between the Scepsians and Cebrenians till Antigonus settled them both together in the city then called Antigonia, but at present Alexandria Troas. The Cebrenians remained there with the other inhabitants ... \\" Cebrenia is also briefly noted in Book 5, chapter 33 of Pliny's later Natural History, concerning Troas and the adjoining nations: \\"The first place in Troas is Hamaxitus, then Cebrenia, and then Troas itself, formerly called Antigonia, and now Alexandria, a Roman colony.\\" The name Cebrenia had mythological roots.

During his long career, American film director Darren Aronofsky has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell in \\"development hell\\" or were cancelled.  1990s  = Ronin = Eleven days after the release of Pi, his first film, Aronofsky signed a deal with New Line Cinema in July 1998 to direct a film adaptation of Frank Miller's Ronin comic book series. Frank Miller, the author of the comic book, was attached to write the script. However, the project never materialized and Aronofsky left it to direct Requiem for a Dream.  2000s  = Sector 7 = On May 24, 2000, Aronofsky was announced to direct a film adaptation of David Wiesner's Sector 7 for Nickelodeon Movies. Eric Watson was attached to produce the film.

The film was intended to be a reboot of the film series, after the failure of Batman & Robin in 1997, although Warner Bros. originally planned to release the film as a prequel of Tim Burton's Batman. Christian Bale, who later portrayed Batman in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy was attached to star in the lead role. Gillian B. Loeb was supposed to be the main antagonist of the film, replacing Carmine Falcone as the head of Gotham City's mafia. Aronofsky also planned to film the movie in Ciudad Vieja, Montevideo, Uruguay. However, on June 30, 2002, Aronofsky and Miller finally left the project due to other commitments. A reboot of the Batman film series was finally released in 2005 as Batman Begins and directed by Christopher Nolan. = Flicker = On January 28, 2003, Aronofsky was reported to direct a film adaptation of Theodore Roszak's novel Flicker.

Sixteen days later, it was announced during the San Diego Comic-Con International 2008 that Aronofsky would direct the film with David Self attached to write it, leaving the production of Paramount Pictures' The Fighter. On June 12, 2009, it was reported that the film would be released in 2011. However, in July 2009, during the San Diego Comic-Con, MGM reported that the project was slowing down due scheduling conflicts with Aronofsky. Finally, on March 2, 2011, it was reported by Internet Movie Database that Brazilian director Jos√© Padilha would direct the film instead of Aronofsky. The film was finally released in 2014 and directed by Padilha. = Breaking the Bank = On September 21, 2009, Darren Aronofsky was in talks to direct the Lee Murray biopic Breaking the Bank from a script by Kelly Williamson.

However, Aronofsky refused to direct it due his commitment with Wolverine 2. A reboot of the Superman film series was finally released in 2013 as Man of Steel and directed by Zack Snyder. = The Wolverine = On October 13, 2010, SuperHeroHype.com reported that Aronofsky was in talks with 20th Century Fox to direct Wolverine 2, the sixth entry of the X-Men film series that started with X-Men and the planned sequel of Gavin Hood's poorly- received film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, after X-Men director Bryan Singer turned down the offer of directing the film in March 2010. Seven days later, Hugh Jackman confirmed via Vulture.com that Aronofsky would direct the film. On November 13, 2010, Aronofsky confirmed via Upprox that the film would be titled now The Wolverine. However, on March 17, 2011, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Aronofsky left the project because directing would have meant that he had to leave his country for a long time and be away from his family. The film was finally released in 2013 and directed by James Mangold. = Machine Man = On October 26, 2010, Aronofsky reported that he would direct Max Barry‚Äôs novel Machine Man from a Mark Heyman script with Barry producing, for Mandalay Pictures. = Hobgoblin = On March 16, 2011, one day before announcing his departure from The Wolverine film, Aronofsky reported via Deadline Hollywood that he would direct the pilot of a planned TV series entitled Hobgoblin for HBO.

Following Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba's deposition in September 1960 in the midst of the Congo Crisis, many of his supporters became disillusioned with the government in L√©opoldville (modern-day Kinshasa). Under Lumumba's deputy, Antoine Gizenga, leftists organised in Stanleyville (modern-day Kisangani) and in December declared their own government to be the legal successor to the prime minister's administration. Gizenga quickly amassed military strength and, by February 1961, had occupied vast portions of Congolese territory. In August, negotiations between the two governments resulted in Gizenga agreeing to stand down. He returned to the office of deputy under the new prime minister, Cyrille Adoula. Still, Gizenga distanced himself from the central administration and rebuilt his own political and military power. The rival government was not fully reintegrated into the Republic of the Congo until Gizenga was arrested in January 1962.  Background  On 30 June 1960, the Belgian Congo became independent as the Republic of the Congo. However, the domestic situation quickly devolved as the army mutinied, beginning the Congo Crisis. In spite of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba's efforts to calm the troops, the situation worsened. Katanga and South Kasai subsequently seceded from the central government. The United Nations (UN) organised a peacekeeping operation and sent troops to the Congo. On 5 September, President Joseph Kasa- Vubu dismissed Lumumba from his post. The government was paralyzed by the political battle that ensued, and on 14 September, Colonel Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu announced a takeover in L√©opoldville (modern-day Kinshasa) and the installation of his own administration. Two days later, Lumumba was placed under house arrest. By October, supporters of the prime minister were convinced that few of their goals could be achieved through the new government. Antoine Gizenga, Lumumba's deputy prime minister, left for Stanleyville (modern-day Kisangani) on 13 November to form his own government. Other nationalists attempted to join him, including Joseph Mbuyi, Maurice Mpolo, Anicet Kashamura, Christophe Gbenye, Pierre Mulele (former ministers in Lumumba's government), Joseph Okito (vice president of the Senate), and Barth√©lemy Mujanay (governor of the Central Bank of the Congo). Of these, only Kashamura, Gbenye, and Mulele succeeded. Mpolo and Okito were arrested and brought back to the capital while Mbuyi and Mujanay were killed in the Charlesville region. General Victor Lundula, Lumumba's army commander who had been arrested by Mobutu, escaped custody in L√©opoldville and made his way to Stanleyville. He and troops loyal to him pledged allegiance to Gizenga. Gizenga's military strength in Orientale Province rapidly increased, and his army amassed to be 6,000-strong. On 26 November Lundula organised a military parade in Stanleyville involving almost all of the military units in Orientale. The army's cohesion was primarily due to the soldiers' admiration and respect for Lundula and their attraction to Lumumba's nationalist ideals. Also in November, the United Nations General Assembly voted to recognise a delegation assembled by Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu, definitively ending Lumumba's hopes of a legal return to power. On 27 November, the deposed prime minister escaped from his house and made his way towards Stanleyville to join Gizenga, but he was arrested five days later and imprisoned at the army camp in Thysville. Thomas Kanza, Lumumba's appointed delegate to the United Nations, switched allegiances and acted as a representative for Gizenga abroad.  History  Antoine Gizenga On 12 December 1960, Gizenga declared his new government, the Free Republic of the Congo, based in Orientale Province, the legitimate ruling authority in the Congo. The central government almost immediately imposed an effective supply blockade along the Congo River. Despite the military power it possessed, the Stanleyville government never established an extensive administrative structure, functioning in the manner of a government in exile. Still, it had more popular support than either the College of Commissioners-General or Tshombe's government. Most administrative functions remained a responsibility of the former provincial government, which had difficulties coexisting with Gizenga's new centralised authority. The moderate deputies of the provincial assembly fled to L√©opoldville. By 20 February 1961, the Free Republic of the Congo was recognised as the legitimate government of the country by the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, Poland, East Germany, Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Cuba, Iraq, the United Arab Republic, Ghana, Guinea, the Algerian provisional government, and Morocco. Gizenga demanded that Western nations relocate their embassies to Stanleyville or risk having their consuls expelled. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev authorised a payment of $500,000 to Mulele. This money was to be used to pay the rival government's soldiers, as taxes had not been levied in its territory and it was not receiving any revenue by which it could fund the army. Regardless, Soviet spies believed that Mulele embezzled some of the money. The Czech government proposed supplying the regime with weapons via an air bridge from Prague through Egypt, but President Gamal Abdel Nasser vetoed the proposal. Meanwhile, General Lundula established a staff consisting of officers mostly from Orientale and Kasa√Ø. His three most important commanders were Major L. Loso (in charge of the military police), Major Joseph Opepe, and Colonel Camille Yangara. In order to bolster his army, Lundula increased recruitment efforts among the unemployed youth in Stanleyville and younger members of the Mouvement National Congolais. The Free Republic of Congo continued to gain strength throughout the winter. On 24 December, Stanleyville troops occupied Bukavu and arrested the local army commander. Jean Miruho, the Provincial President of Kivu, tried to intervene the next day, but he too was arrested by Gizenga's soldiers and sent to Stanleyville along with the Bukavu army commander. Several provincial deputies were also taken to Stanleyville. At dawn, on 1 January 1961, central government troops advised by the Belgians entered Bukavu from Ruanda and occupied the Saio military camp. Stanleyville forces subsequently intervened, capturing 40 soldiers and ejecting the expedition back into Ruanda. Both sides continued to exchange fire over the border throughout the afternoon. The following day, Anicet Kashamura arrived to take over the Kivu provincial administration. The situation in southern Kivu became chaotic in the following months; Europeans were robbed, beaten, and harassed, with many choosing to flee the area, while over 200 Congolese were killed. UN peacekeepers were unable to contain the violence. Central government soldiers from the raid on Bukavu detained in Stanleyville By 10 January, Stanleyville forces had occupied northern Katanga as far in as Manono without facing resistance. Gizenga's authority was also established over the Sankuru District of Kasai Province. Around then, control had been consolidated in Goma and the northern Kivu region. All local political prisoners were released. Fear of another Belgian-supported invasion from Ruanda led to an exchange of fire on 12 January over the border between Goma and Gisenyi. The rival government reached its greatest territorial extent on 24 February when some of its forces briefly earned the allegiance of the Luluabourg garrison. Also in February, seven Lumumba supporters including Orientale Provincial President Jean-Pierre Finant, were tried by a \\"traditional court\\" of Baluba chiefs near Bakwanga and were executed for committing \\"crimes against the Baluba nation\\". In retaliation, Free Republic of the Congo authorities shot 15 political prisoners in Stanleyville, including Gilbert Pongo, one of the military officers who captured Lumumba, and Lumumba's minister of communications, Alphonse Songolo. Songolo had broken with Lumumba's stance in mid-October and traveled to Stanleyville with several colleagues to try to garner support against him until he was arrested. The central government had unsuccessfully tried to secure his release. On 17 January 1961, discipline in Thysville faltered and the central government transferred Lumumba to √âlisabethville, the capital of Katanga. Once there, he was brutally tortured at the hands of Mo√Øse Tshombe and Godefroid Munongo, his chief political rivals and the leaders of the secessionist state. That night he was executed by a Belgo-Katangese firing squad. When news of Lumumba's death broke in February, 3,000‚Äì4,000 angry soldiers gathered in the European quarter of Stanleyville to enact revenge upon the local residents. General Lundula negotiated with them through the night and eventually persuaded them to leave the city in peace. On 15 February, the Stanleyville government released all detained foreigners. Still, the death of Lumumba brought negative opinion of both Katanga and the central government to an all-time high. Hoping to defuse the situation, the central government opened serious negotiations with Gizenga's government. In March, Cl√©ophas Kamitatu was dispatched from L√©opoldville to Stanleyville for talks. The blockade on the Free Republic of Congo was lifted the following month. Several attempts were made in June to bring Gizenga's government into the Non-Aligned Movement, though the proposals were blocked by other member states. In July, the Soviet diplomatic mission arrived in Stanleyville followed by the Chinese later that month. = De jure disestablishment = Alphonse Songolo Delegates from both governments met at the United Nations mission in L√©opoldville for negotiations on 13 June. The central government was represented by Cyrille Adoula, Jean Bolikango, and Marcel Lihau while the Stanleyville government was represented by Jacques Massena, Etienne Kihuyu, and S. P. Mapago. Meetings were held over the next three days and on 19 June. At the conclusion of the last meeting, the delegates signed an agreement stipulating the holding of a UN-supervised conference at Lovanium University to discuss the political future of the Congo. In July UN peacekeepers cordoned off Lovanium and prepared it for the reconvening of Parliament. Gbenye, Kashamura, and 58 other deputies from Orientale and Kivu attended, but Gizenga chose to remain in Stanleyville. The nationalists held a slight advantage, and on 2 August a new coalition government was sworn in with Adoula as Prime Minister and Gizenga as First Deputy Prime Minister. Gbenye returned to Stanleyville to convince Gizenga to go to the capital and assume his post. On 6 August he declared his recognition of the Adoula Government as legitimate but made no statement on whether he would go to L√©opoldville. The mending of relations was formally celebrated on 15 August when Adoula flew to Stanleyville and laid a wreath on a monument dedicated to Lumumba. Provincial deputies from the Sankuru region resumed their work in the Kasai Provincial Assembly. With Gizenga brought back into the central government, the Soviets quickly returned their diplomatic mission to L√©opoldville and encouraged Adoula to carry on Lumumba's legacy and end the Katangan secession. China, however, recalled its diplomatic mission back to Beijing and stated that Gizenga's government had \\"terminated its existence\\". The United Arab Republic (UAR) kept its ambassador in Stanleyville and declared that it would follow the direction of the Stanleyville government. After being informed on the plan for Stanleyville's integration into the central government, the UAR announced that it would relocate its embassy back to the capital in January 1962. = Final dissolution = Gizenga returned to Stanleyville in September to rally armed forces to retake northern Katanga. The invasion failed, but Gizenga refused to return to L√©opoldville. Fulfilling none of his official duties, he established a 300-strong militia and began administrating the Orientale Province independent of the central government. On 19 October he engineered the removal of Provincial President Jean Manzikala and replaced him with Simon Losala, one of his supporters. Pro-Gizenga administrators were installed in the Maniema and Sankuru districts, while Orientale and Kivu-based army units seemed to be under his control. The Orientale provincial gendarmerie also repudiated the authority of the central government army and provincial authorities, pledging complete loyalty to Gizenga. By November, Gizenga once again posed a significant political and military threat to the L√©opoldville administration. His actions deeply divided the nationalists in Parliament, as some felt that it was appropriate to join him and re-establish a Stanleyville regime, while other felt it best to stay in the capital and push for their preferred policies through the government. However, by then Gizenga had forfeited his claim of a legitimate successor government and appeared to be planning an outright rebellion. But military setbacks and political deterioration in Orientale shook the faith of the moderate Lundula; on 11 November, he left Orientale for L√©opoldville. That same day Gizenga's reputation was further diminished when Stanleyville troops murdered 13 Italian UN aviators in what became known as the Kindu atrocity. On 13 November Lundula pledged his allegiance to Adoula's government, disavowing Gizenga's actions as illegal. In December the central government reached a temporary truce with Katanga, and refocused its efforts on eliminating the threat posed by Gizenga. A 1963 postage stamp commemorating the \\"reconciliation\\" of the political factions in the Congo after the end of the secessions in Katanga and South Kasai as well as in the east On 23 December 25 members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, introduced a motion calling for the central government to recall Gizenga to the capital, disband his gendarmerie, and appoint a special commissioner to assume control over Orientale's administration. On 8 January 1962, the Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution demanding that Gizenga be recalled and return to L√©opoldville within 48 hours, the disbanding of his militia, and the appointment of a special commission to reestablish central authority in Orientale. Two days later, Gizenga responded by saying he would do nothing unless the Katangan secession was resolved. Adoula ordered General Lundula to arrest Gizenga and dissolve what remained of his administration. Gizenga retaliated by ordering the provincial gendarmerie to detain Lundula and the UN officials in Stanleyville who had been investigating the Kindu atrocity. The officers of the gendarmerie refused to enforce the order, probably because the UN alerted its local garrison of the situation. On 12 January, a motion to strip Gizenga from his ministerial post was introduced in the Chamber. The following day, the provincial president of Orientale pledged his support to the central government and expressed his wish for Gizenga to leave Stanleyville. Clashes between gendarmes and central government troops throughout the city ensued, resulting in several deaths. Lundula, with the support of Adoula, requested UN assistance in eliminating the gendarmerie. UN Secretary General U Thant ordered peacekeeping troops to restore order while Lundula's soldiers surrounded Gizenga's residence. Gradually Gizenga's militia surrendered and he was placed under house arrest. From 14 to 16 January a platoon of peacekeepers assisted Lundula's troops in disarming the provincial gendarmerie. On 15 January Gizenga was formally censured by Parliament and stripped of the vice premiership.  Aftermath  Gizenga's arrest deepened divisions in Parliament. Upon his own request, UN troops assumed the task of guarding Gizenga. On 20 January 1962, he was, at the behest of General Lundula and the provincial government, flown by the UN to L√©opoldville. Two days later, Gizenga requested that the UN lift its guard, which was quickly replaced by the central government's \\"protection\\". On 25 January, he was imprisoned at Camp Kokolo. Upon request from Gizenga, Thant asked that Adoula respect the rival leader's legal rights. In February Adoula assured leftist members of his government that Gizenga would not be executed. He was eventually incarcerated on Bula Mbemba Island at the mouth of the Congo River, where he would remain until his release in 1964. In May, a Chamber of Deputies commission found Gizenga guilty of inciting a mutiny, mistreating prisoners, and seeking foreign aid (from President Nasser of Egypt) to launch a rebellion. He was formally impeached and his parliamentary immunity was removed. In August, the Orientale was divided into three provinces, thereby weakening its position as a political body. The following month, Stanleyville was brought directly under central administration.

Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings. Robert commanded 60 ships in the fleet supporting the landing of William I of England and the Norman conquest of England. Around 1068, Robert was given the Hastings Castle and the adjacent territories previously owned by Onfroy du Tilleul. According to the Domesday Book, Robert and his son William each possessed lands in separate counties. The sum of the annual income generated by the lands of the two men amounted to about 690 pounds sterling. In 1069 he was charged by the king to support Robert, Count of Mortain, to monitor the Danes, whose fleet moored in the mouth of the Humber, while the latter was to repress the revolt initiated by Eadric the Wild the west. When the Danes left their sanctuary to plunder the neighbourhood, the two commanders and their army fell upon them unexpectedly, crushing them, and forcing them to flee by sea. After the death of King William, Robert followed the party of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy. Dismayed by his softness and debauchery, he turned, along with several other Norman lords, towards the king William II the Red, from whom he received several garrisons for his castles. During the attempted intervention of the English king in Normandy in February 1091, he was one of his supporters. He died after this episode and his son William II succeeded him as count. Robert married first Beatrix de Falaise, sister of Arlette de Falaise. Robert and Beatrix had four children: * Raoul d'Eu (d. after 1036) * Robert d'Eu (d. 1149) * Condoha (Condor) (d. after 1087) married in 1058 to Fulk d'Angoul√™me, and was mother of William V d'Angoul√™me and grandmother of Wulgrin II d'Angoul√™me. * William II, who succeeded his father as Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings * Eremburga of Mortain (possible), the second wife of Roger i, Count of Sicily. * Armand of Mortain (possible), married to Beatrix, daughter of Tancred of Hauteville. Very devout, he made numerous donations to the Church, notably lands at F√©camp Abbey of Rouen in 1051. After being widowed, he remarried, to Mathilde de Hauteville, daughter of Roger I, Count of Sicily, and Judith of Evreux, a second cousin of William the Conqueror. He repudiated her, however, and in 1080 she was married to Raymond IV of Saint-Gilles, Count of Toulouse and Marquis of Provence. He was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Michel du Tr√©port, which he had founded in Tr√©port, near the town of Eu, between 1057 and 1066, in memory of his first wife. Robert was assisted by the council of Duke William and Maurilius, archbishop of Rouen. Robert was succeeded as Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings by his son William.

He worked in a cigar factory first, then a comb factory.Biographical notes @ Verein Hamburgischer Staatsbeamter. After his father's death in 1868, he followed his true inclinations and enrolled at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, where he studied with Ludwig Knaus until 1871. After that, he took private lessons from Wilhelm Sohn. In 1873, he had his first major showing at the World Exposition in Vienna and, the following year, began exhibiting regularly at the Prussian Academy of Arts. In 1877, he was awarded a gold medal at an exhibition in Ghent. During the 1880s, he undertook an extensive study trip through the marshlands of North Friesland; inspired by the \\"Volkskunde\\" (ethnographic) approach to painting, pioneered by Rudolf Jordan. In 1883, he became associated with the artists' colony at Katwijk. From 1892 to 1893, he worked as a professor of genre painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, then transferred to the Berlin University of the Arts. In both positions, his friend, Fritz Mackensen, served as his personal assistant. He also became a member of \\"\\", a progressive art society in D√ºsseldorf, and the Prussian Academy.

However it is capable of reaching very high temperatures, up to about 1370¬∞C. There is a door or bricked-up opening at the front for loading and unloading, and one or two short chimneys at the rear. They are one type of \\"cross-draught\\" kilns, where the flames travel more or less horizontally, rather than up from or down to the floor.Rawson, 364; Wood. However, references can be found referring to them as up-draught, and also down-draught The kilns were normally made of brick; sometimes most of the structure was dug out below the loess soil, with only the dome and chimney protruding above ground. In either case the interior was normally lined with a refractory fireclay. In some cases, especially in later periods, the fire box was approached by a tunnel. Initially the kilns were fired with wood, but during the Northern Song period (960‚Äì1127) there was a general switch to coal, easily found in north China, which required a smaller fire box, but the introduction of saggars to protect the pieces from gritty coal ash. This changed the reducing quality of the atmosphere during firing, which affected the colours of various wares, wood giving a reducing atmosphere and coal an oxidizing one.Vainker, 124 A firing might take as long as two weeks, including the cooling time.\\"Mantou kiln, in Song greenwares\\", Ashmolean Museum The details of the design could be very variable. A temporary \\"bag wall\\" might be built at the front of the kiln, once loaded, to protect the wares from the direct flames, and enclose the fire. The back interior wall might be straight, giving a semi-circular shape to the chamber. Various different arrangements for controlling the airflow at front and back by vents and stone doors are found.Medley, 117‚Äì118 Generally the firing was even across the various parts of the chamber compared to the dragon kiln, but the load far smaller, with saggars perhaps only hundreds of pieces, rather than the tens of thousands a large dragon kiln could take for a single firing.Kerr, 348 Wares fired in mantou kilns include Ding ware, Yaozhou ware and other Northern Celadons, Jun, Ru, and Cizhou wares. The zhenyao \\"egg-shaped kiln\\", developed for Jingdezhen ware in the late Ming dynasty,Rawson, 370 is in some ways a compromise between mantou and dragon kilns, like a stretched mantou kiln.

He has also written on a variety of topics, including cancer research, litigation, and financial matters, such as real estate loans, mortgages and credit consolidation. Biography =Career= Over the past thirty years, Hamel has penned hundreds of articles on secular and religious themes. His articles have appeared in national magazines, including James Dobson's Focus on the Family. Hamel has also researched and written scientific articles, ranging in topics from Big Pharma to surviving cancer for such notable organizations as the Institute for Justice, which litigates liberty issues in the nation's highest courts. Hamel was himself an IJ plaintiff in a case that was won in Federal Court. Hamel has contributed to Religion at the Margins and the internationally distributed Solutions Journal and has reviewed books, spanning subjects from religion to neuroscience. Hamel was part of the founding of the ROW Foundation in 2015 and served as its first Director of Communications. The ROW Foundation provides treatment resources to people with epilepsy and associated psychiatric disorders. ROW also helps neurologists and psychiatrists in the developed world train practitioners in the developing world to more effectively treat epilepsy and associated psychiatric disorders. The Foundation has received GuideStar‚Äôs Platinum Seal of Transparency. Hamel wrote the book One World: One Standard, which outlines the Foundation‚Äôs mission and unique method of helping people in undeveloped regions of the world deal with epilepsy. Hamel is also a regular contributor to Pinnacle Forum America, writing their monthly Pinnacle Pulse articles, Hamel is a multi-time cancer survivor, having gone through two bone marrow transplants and multiple other treatments to fight lymphoma. He wrote about his experience in a seminal book that explores his journey from diagnosis to treatment to surviving, called Stumbling Toward Heaven. Hamel also produced a video series about his cancer journey in order to demystify the experience of cancer treatment. In recommending Hamel's book, We Will Be Landing Shortly: Now What?, nationally renowned author and speaker, Brian D. McLaren, who was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the most influential evangelical leaders in the U.S. said, \\"I trust Mike Hamel's questions more than I trust most people‚Äôs answers. I also trust his wisdom‚Ä¶ a treasure which nobody gains without pain and struggle. It is a rare gift to enter into the thoughts of a good and wise man who faces something daily we all must face someday.\\" In We Will Be Landing Shortly: Now What? Hamel also explained how he turned the bedtime stories he had told his four children into Young Adult (YA) novels. He completed the decade-long effort, resulting in a YA novel series called Matterhorn the Brave, which was published in 2006 by Living Ink Books, an imprint of AMG Publishers. Each book in the series is set in a different location and time period and features a supporting cast of diverse characters, modeled after his own children. Matterhorn the Brave features four adolescents (ages 12‚Äì14) who are recruited by the Praetorians of First Realm ‚Äî a mirror world of Earth ‚Äî to keep an eye on the development of civilization. To do this, they time-travel through portals and physically mature to adulthood in the process. When heretics murder the king of First Realm, his daughter, Queen Bea, enlists the kids‚Äô help to recover some of the Ten Talis hidden on Earth. The Talis were fashioned by The Maker as tangible symbols of his power. The heretics need these sacred objects for their scheme of taking over the Earth by rewriting its history. The Pulitzer Prize winning daily newspaper, The Gazette, called Hamel's Matterhorn the Brave series \\"a blend of adventure, fantasy and science fiction. There are sword fights, a cast of characters that includes leprechauns, Sasquatch and merpeople, and time travel to various lands and centuries, accompanied by heady physics discussions of how it all works. He [Hamel] eschews interior monologue for action and dialogue and engaging the senses.\\" The book titles in the Matterhorn series are: * Book 1 ‚Äî The Sword and the Flute: Ireland, AD 700 * Book 2 ‚Äî Talis Hunters: Pacific Northwest, 10,000 BC * Book 3 ‚Äî Pyramid Scheme: Egypt, 1325 BC * Book 4 ‚Äì Jewel Heist: Bermuda Triangle, AD 1292 * Book 5 ‚Äì Dragon‚Äôs Tale: China, 246 BC * Book 6 ‚Äì Rylan the Renegade: Greenland, AD 985 * Book 7 ‚Äì Tunguska Event: Siberia, AD 1908 and Asia, 160 BC * Book 8 ‚Äì The Book of Stories: Chicago, AD 1983 Hamel went on to write The Lighthouse Company(TLC) book series, which chronicles a group of kids in the fictional Washington town of Cape Myra, near the Northwest tip of the continental U.S. They meet in the basement of the lighthouse run by Mr. Tyler, aka The Captain. His grandson, JJ, comes to live with him every summer and leads TLC in solving mysteries, finding treasures and helping Cape Myra's two-man police force.

It is one of the most species-rich genera of Asilidae, with particularly high diversity in arid or semi-arid ecosystems of the New World. Description Small to large-sized robber flies (10‚Äì40 mm) with distinctly different shape of the posterior end of the abdomen in males versus females. Females have a short or long ovipositor that is hairless and short conical to slender wedge-shaped, its color is usually glossy black. Males have a \\"helicopter tail\\" with glossy black claspers that are covered in hairs, forming part of a complex genital structure (the combined epandrium and hypandrium) that is clearly larger than the abdominal segments and is oriented diagonally to vertically upwards relative to the main body axis. Abdominal coloration is usually greyish to brownish in females, versus more contrasting with silvery and/or black segments or patches in males. In both sexes the tip of the genitalia usually extends past the wing tips. Wings are clear or uniformly tinted, with tints varying from transparent brown to dark black. Venation includes a recurrent vein on R1, narrow cell r4, R4 extending roughly parallel to R5 or converging moderately with R5 towards the wing tip. Biology As is typical for robber flies, adult Efferia are ambush predators, taking off from a resting position on the ground or on a branch to intercept other flying insects in mid-air. Prey are taken from a wide variety of insect orders: Robert Lavigne's Predator-Prey Database for the family Asilidaehttp://www.geller-grimm.de/catalog/lavigne.htm Predator-Prey Database for the family Asilidae has 918 records for Efferia species feeding frequently on Diptera, Homoptera, Hymenoptera, Heteroptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, as well as a few reports of prey species belonging to Neuroptera, Odonata, Ephemeroptera - and even one record for Araneae (spiders). Other asilids are frequently preyed upon, and cannibalism is common as well. Efferia species of deserts and grasslands can occur in high abundance, at times even exceeding one individual per square foot. They tend to perch close to the ground and often remain quite immobile - sometimes until they're about to get stepped on. Spotting them is often a matter of first hearing the typically short evasive flight, before seeing where one landed. This is especially true for the males, which emit a characteristic pulsing buzz during the few seconds in flight; this sound tends to be loud and noticeably higher pitched than that of a flying female. If you slowly approach a perched individual during hot weather then it may repeatedly fly up and grab any mosquitoes or freeloader flies circling around you, often returning to its original perch to feed for several minutes after each catch.

Plot  In the Nevada Desert, Daphne Blake, host of \\"Daphne Blake's Mysterious Mysteries\\" on the Knitting Channel, and Fred Jones, Daphne's best friend and cameraman, are waiting to meet up with a contact for their latest scoop: Doctor Velma Dinkley. Velma is one of the chief scientists in a private research facility known as the Complex. When Velma goes to meet the two from an underground entrance, Velma is accidentally attacked by Fred. Scooby-Doo, a subject prototype in the Complex's Smart Dog program, and Norville \\"Shaggy\\" Rogers, his trainer, are attending the Blazing Man Festival nearby, when Scooby is alerted to Velma's attack. Scooby and Shaggy go track Velma, and meet up with her, Daphne, and Fred. Velma decides to explain to Daphne why she called her to Nevada, and brings everyone into the Complex. Velma explains that the people who founded the Complex (known as the Four) were working on a top-secret project known as Elysium. The project involved dispersing self-replicating nanites around the world. These nanites would \\"Transform Humanity\\", and help rid humans of their primal urges, such as violence and greed, and thereby creating a more peaceful world, one that would work toward the betterment of humanity overall. However, Velma learned that the Four modified the nanites' code so that they wouldd be able to control the humans, which is why she decided to reveal the truth. While in the Complex's Safe Room, an alarm goes off, alerting Velma that the nanites have been activated on their own, when only the Four can activate them when they are all together in the Complex. After leaving the Safe Room, the group learn that the nanites have transformed the majority of the Complex's employees into monster- like creatures (nicknamed Beasties), killing and eating humans who have not transformed. After seeing what has happened, the group decides to flee. Shaggy remembers one scientist was working on an armored van designed for an apocalypse-like scenario, dubbed the Mystery Machine, which the group uses to flee the Complex. While driving away from the Complex, Scooby and Shaggy notice the Blazing Man festival has been completely overrun with Beasties, meaning that the nanite plague was not just contained in one area, as hoped by Velma. The group finds a retail store, and use it for food and supplies. However, while there, a horde of Beasties come by. Scooby is able to distract most of them, but Fred is attacked by one of the Beasties, breaking his leg. The group quickly stock up and head to a hospital nearby in order to fix Fred's leg. While there, Velma notices that some people who had some technology embedded in them were not affected by the plague. The group is able to get Fred's leg fixed up, while Velma is able to get a laptop to hack into the Complex's network and access its files. Somewhere in California, the group is resting up, while Velma decides to run away, leaving a note that says \\"I'm sorry\\" on her laptop, which is open to her notes on Project Elysium. In her notes, Velma reveals that the Four were actually the Five. The Four were her four brothers, each who had been successful in their own field: Military, Politics, Science, and Business. Velma had also excelled in Science, gaining several doctorates in various fields, but was a social outcast. However, when the Complex was in process of being built, they had invited her into joining them, and turning the Four into the Five. Velma was the one who came up with Project Elysium and made it a reality. When Velma had released the final set of nanites in Paris, she discovered the truth about the Four going behind her back and changing the goals of Project Elysium, and decided to contact Daphne in the hopes of releasing her story, as her brothers' influence would be able to detect and shut down the story if it was coming from the mainstream media. Although her brothers modified her work, Velma blames herself for the plague. After discovering her notes, the group is able to track Velma down. Daphne, who had suspected Velma of hiding something from the beginning, forgives her. With the group reunited, Velma suggests heading north to Dinkley Tower in Seattle, Washington, where her brother, Rufus Dinkley, resides. Velma knows that the Complex had several facilities, and that Dinkley Tower (or better yet, Rufus) may have the locations for the other facilities, in hopes of developing a cure. Meanwhile, Scooby is revealed to not be the only Smart Dog that survived the Complex. The pack of Smart Dogs, led by a small dog named Scrappy Doo, have been mostly ignored by the Beasties, but their cerebral implants have been malfunctioning. Scrappy's implants seems to be working the most, but he knows that his are deteriorating. In order for the pack to survive, they need to keep the human intellect they have gained, which means they need to find Velma to fix their implants. Scrappy realizes that he needs to become stronger if he and his pack want to live, so he activates some experimental nanotechnology embedded in his body, dramatically increasing his size and strength, and allowing him to walk on only his hind legs. While Scrappy and his pack track Velma, he finds a boy named Cliffy, who lost an arm and his family to the Beasties. Scrappy decides to bring Cliffy along with them. As the group approaches Seattle and Dinkley Tower, they notice that for some reason, there have been almost no Beasties in sight. Velma believes that due to the nanites, the Beasties are working as a hive mind, and are migrating to some location. As they get closer, they notice that several cars on the road to Seattle have been abandoned, making it nearly impossible to drive there. Fred, still with an injured leg, is forced to stay in the Mystery Machine, while the rest head to Dinkley tower. As they approach, they see a wall of Beasties covering one side of the tower, appearing as a shrine to someone or something. Meanwhile, Rufus and his wife, Daisy, have been surviving in Dinkley Tower. Rufus' mind and memory has been slowly deteriorating, although he does not realize it, and when Daisy tries to point something out, he hits her. Rufus had two scientists, and tried to force them to figure out how to control the Beasties, but when they are not able to, he got enraged and beat them to death. While Velma confronts her brother, Fred calls Shaggy, as he notices the Beasties have built a giant statue shaped like Rufus, and are climbing up the Tower. While Daisy believes that they should be safe thanks to the Tower's security system, Rufus reveals that he disabled it, as he believes the Beasties are here to worship him. The group, realizing that he has gone crazy, leaves the Tower, with Daisy joining them. As they escape, Rufus is last seen taken by the Beasties and placed into the statue, burned alive. AS the group move through Washington, Scooby tells Velma that he can hear a signal that's directing the Beasties to some location. As they follow the Beasties, they encounter Scrappy Doo and his pack, who tells them that he wants to kill Scooby and get Velma to fix his (and the pack's) implants. However, Scrappy, Velma, Scooby Doo, and Cliffy encounter a group of Beasties, who attempt to attack them. Scrappy stays behind to defend them, as the others head back to the rest of the group and the Mystery Machine. While Scrappy survives, his pack does not. Scrappy finds out that the Beasties are coming together to form one giant being, controlled by a Beast with a rather intelligent mind. The being attempts to walk, but with a lack of structure, it fails. After hearing Velma's thoughts, the Mind Beast wants to add Velma to the giant, but Scrappy goes in to destroy the Mind Beast, with Scooby following behind. Scrappy defeats the Mind Beast, but before they can celebrate, the Beasties come back to consciousness. Shaggy is saved by Scrappy Doo, who gives the group time to escape. While they succeed in escaping, Scrappy is never found, upsetting Cliffy. Sometime around Christmas Eve in Wisconsin, the group head to a place known as the Athena Center, which housed the Complex's cloud servers and backup data. Velma tries to gain information from the servers in hopes of finding a cure, but finds that it is hopeless for her to be able to do so. As the group travels around the U.S. in order to survive the apocalypse, they find a mall in Albany, New York. Velma sees the mall and believes that it is the perfect place to start a survivor's camp/fortress. Using the city's sewers, they are able to get in, and find that every few hours, Beasties from two stores opposite of each other in the mall (CJ Nickel and MEARS) come out and fight each other, leaving a pile of Beast corpses in the mall. The group decides to shelter in the upper levels of the mall. As they do so, Daisy sets bombs near the stairs and escalators to prevent the Beasties from inside the mall from reaching them, while the group barricades the other entrances and exits, protecting them from the Beasties outside. While the group waits for the warring Beastie factions to dwindle in size, Cliffy notices that every time they fight, both sides always have a large amount of Beasties that never seems to be shrinking. Velma comes to a conclusion that the Beasties may be breeding. Daphne and Fred decide to go to one of the stores, CJ Nickel, to check. Before they do so, Fred asks Daphne to marry him [which he has asked millions of times before, with her always saying no]. However, he tells her this will be the last time. Daphne says yes, as they enter. The two go in and find a room full of eggs, where the Beasties are growing. Daphne shoots at the eggs, killing nearly all of them. When they look outside the room, they find that the matured Beasties are all dead, likely due to a psychic link between the children and the parents. However, one egg hatches, and the beast mortally wounds Fred before Daphne can kill it. Daphne goes back to the group, and they mourn Fred's death. Six months later, the Hudson Mall has been turned into Jonestown, a shelter for the humans who survived the nanite plague, named after Fred. Velma is currently the leader of Jonestown, and has been dating Shaggy for some time. Daisy has become a mother of sorts to Cliffy. Daphne, meanwhile, has become distant and vengeful since Fred's death (six months prior, when the group went back to CJ Nickel after Fred's death, his body was found missing, and was presumed to have been taken by the Beasties). Scrappy Doo is revealed to have survived, and his implants are now functioning again. Scrappy becomes a citizen of Jonestown, and joins Daphne on her hunts. While some citizens of Jonestown rescue a few survivors, they find Fred, who appears to be in a zombified state, approaching them. They shoot him and report back to Velma, who believes it is best not to tell Daphne at this time. A day later, Scooby accidentally shocks himself while Daisy is fixing an electrical grid. Surprisingly, the electric shock fixes Scooby's implants, causing him to speak with a fully intellectual mind, rather than his usual limited vocabulary. Daphne laughs at this surprise, and the others join in (although Scooby does not find it amusing). Daphne apologizes, as there have been few times in their lives to laugh since Fred died. Upon saying this, she notices an uneasy silence in the room. Velma decides to come clean about Fred's return as a zombie. Daphne decides to blow off some steam by going hunting with Scrappy. Some time after hunting for Beasties, Scrappy and Daphne decide to take a rest. While Scrappy sleeps, Daphne contemplates suicide, as she wishes join Fred in death. Before she pulls the trigger, Zombie Fred approaches with a group of Beasties. Scrappy sees this, and tries to help Daphne with dealing with the Beasties, but Daphne (as well a mysterious stranger Scrappy seems to be working with) tells Scrappy to head to Jonestown to get backup. As Scrappy heads back, the stranger tells him to trust him, as this is for the best. The stranger also tells Scrappy that he is heading to Albany. It is revealed that Rufus is alive, and is with the stranger. The stranger is revealed to be another of Velma's brothers, Quentin Dinkley. At Jonestown, Cliffy tries to cope with Scooby's new intelligence, as he feels that he will lose him, just as he has lost his friends and family in the apocalypse. Scooby promises that will not happen. Meanwhile, Shaggy has noticed that Velma has been behaving erratically, even going back to calling him \\"Norville\\", which she knows that Shaggy hates. Shaggy confronts her, and she admits that she is now pregnant. While Shaggy is ecstatic, the celebration is cut short when Scrappy comes back and tells them that Zombie Fred has kidnapped Daphne. Fred tries to get Daphne to listen to her, but she refuses, as she does not believe that she is talking to the real Fred. Fred tries to explain that the nanites have chosen him as an avatar to represent their voices, but she does not listen to him. Daphne is able to escape from Fred and his Beasties just as the group come by with the Mystery Machine. As they are heading back, Fred stands in front of the way. Daphne tells Shaggy to run him over, but Shaggy refuses, braking just before touching Fred. Fred gets on his knees and surrenders. As the gang approaches, a helicopter arrives, carrying Velma's brothers, Quentin and a severely burned Rufus. Quentin says he will explain, but shoots Fred's head off first. The Nanites re-attach Fred's head back onto his body. Quentin explains he did that so that the group would lose any emotional attachment. Fred offers to explain, and the group takes Quentin, Rufus, and Fred back to Jonestown. Scrappy explains to Scooby that after fighting off the Beasties in Washington, he had been struggling to survive and recover, going from place to place to rest and get food. Unfortunately, his implants were starting to fail, and he was losing intelligence, making it harder for him to survive. Eventually, he found himself in Sacramento, surrounded by Beasties. As all hope was lost, a drone came by and took out the Beasties. Scrappy followed the drone to the Beta Complex, which was housing Quentin and some scientists. Quentin healed Scrappy and fixed his implants. After he had fully recovered, Quentin requested Scrappy to head to Jonestown and give reports. Velma talks to Quentin in her office, where Quentin explains that Rufus survived due to a vaccine made to counteract the nanites. Outside Velma's office, Rufus sees Daisy. Rufus tries to follow her and tell Daisy that he loves her, but a pair of guards stop him. Daisy feels traumatized, and Shaggy comforts her. Meanwhile, Daphne has Fred kept in a room, surrounded with guns trained on him. Fred keeps trying to get her to believe that it is him, but she does not. A group of guards report to Daphne that the Beasties outside seem to be acting up, as if they are working together in an intelligent manner. Daphne immediately accuses Fred of controlling these Beasties. Fred claims that it is not him, then reacts, and tells them that the Nanite King has arrived. Fred explains how the nanites had developed into two factions: the first one believed that humans were beyond redemption, and that they should extinguish human life, turning most humans into Beasties, and a second faction, a smaller group that now resides in Fred, believed that the world can be saved by combining humans and nanites together. The first group created a body of nanites to lead the Beasties, calling itself the Nanite King. The Beasties that are currently surrounding the mall is being led by the King. Fred asks to fuse his nanites with everyone, but Daphne says that they have survived thus far without the nanites' help. Meanwhile, Quentin explains that the vaccine was a potential cure that was still in its experimental stages, but Rufus took it anyway. Rufus, like most inhabitants of Jonestown, had a biological immunity to the nanites, but while the vaccine helped prevent dying from the fire, it was destroying him, making him mentally unstable, as Daisy and the others had seen when they last saw him in Seattle. Before they can discuss any further, the Beasties start attacking from the roof and start killing the inhabitants in the upper levels of the mall. Daisy activates the bombs she set near the upper levels to slow them down. When a Beastie comes close to Daisy, Rufus protects her. As they get overwhelmed, Fred releases the nanites from his body to take out all the Beasties in the mall at once. However, the Nanite King retaliates by using his own nanites to destroy the mall. Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, Scooby, Daisy, Cliffy, Scrappy, Quentin, and Rufus all manage to survive by hiding in the sewers, along with a handful of Jonestown citizens. After reaching the surface, a jet comes by to pick everyone up and take them to Complex Beta. An excited Velma states that with the technological advancements that surpass the Nevada Complex, and with the information of the experimental vaccine Quentin used on Rufus, she can make a cure. While Velma starts working on a cure, the Nanite King comes to Velma, referring to her as the Nanites' \\"mother.\\" Because she created them, the Nanite King gives her an offer: a chance for her and her unborn child to join them. The Nanite King gives her three days to consider, or they will attack, and kill her with all the other humans. Rufus' cell structure becomes unstable and he dies, surrounded by Daisy, Quentin and Velma. Before he dies, Rufus tells Velma that he is sorry for everything. Three days later, while everyone is sleeping at night, the Nanite King approaches Velma to know her decision. Velma offers to go with the Nanite King, as long as the nanites do not hurt anyone else. The Nanite King refuses. Daphne and Shaggy attack the Nanite King, while Fred sneaks up and merges its nanites with the Nanite King. Fred explains that Velma gave him a virus to disable the nanites. With all the nanites destroyed, there is nothing keeping Fred alive anymore. As he dies again, he tells Daphne he loves her. In the following months, the effects of the nanite plague started to decrease. Some of the Beasties reverted back to their human forms, and eventually regained their intelligence, while others were immune to the cure. However, humanity was able to start rebuilding civilization. The story ends with Velma giving birth to a baby boy: Frederick Rufus Rogers Dinkley. Shaggy and Velma name Daphne as Frederick's godmother and Scooby-Doo as his godfather.  Characters  = Main characters = * Scoobert \\"Scooby\\" Doo ‚Äì Scooby-Doo is a \\"Smart Dog\\" prototype, who is able to talk like a human being, thanks to a chip that was implanted in his cerebral cortex. This enables him to communicate with others, either by words or through the use of a pair of emoji-goggles. He was treated poorly by the rest of the smart dogs in the underground Nevada complex as the runt of the litter, being constantly attacked by them. Eventually, he ended up standing up against the other dogs after Shaggy taught him how to defend himself. Unlike his cartoon counterpart, Scooby is quite brave and is not afraid of anything that stands in his way. His original name was 24062, having been named Scooby-Doo by Shaggy himself. * Frederick \\"Fred\\" Jones ‚Äì Fred Jones was the doting cameraman of Daphne Blake's Mysterious Mysteries, hosted by his long-time friend, Daphne Blake. Having attended the same college as Daphne, Fred has always been there for her. Over the years he developed a crush on Daphne and has since tried to prove himself as a man worthy of her affections (he states that he proposed to her numerous times), even though Daphne states that she sees him only as a friend (which he does not believe for a minute). He acts as Daphne's moral compass sometimes, and is usually the voice of reason whenever there are fights among the gang. Nearly after a year after the nanite apocalypse happened, he is killed, only to be resurrected by the nanites. * Daphne Blake ‚Äì Daphne Blake was a budding journalist, who came from a wealthy family. Her career plummeted after she failed to expose a story she had been working on for almost a year. After that, she was lucky to get a slot on the Knitting Channel, hosting Daphne Blake's Mysterious Mysteries, which further contributed to her being seen by her peers as a laughing stock. As a journalist, she feels compelled to finding the truth, no matter what the cost. Known for being extremely distrustful, she has a sharp tongue and a sarcastic vein. Still, under a tough shell, Daphne is shown to be very caring and very fearful for the well-being of everyone in the gang, especially Fred, for whom she has a soft spot. * Norville \\"Shaggy\\" Rogers ‚Äì Norville Rogers, nicknamed Shaggy by his friends, was a dog handler in the Nevada Complex, where he was responsible for the treatment and training of the \\"Smart Dog\\" prototypes. On his first day on the job, he saved Scooby-Doo from being ripped to pieces by the other prototypes, making it his mission to show the Great Dane how to defend himself against the others. Later, this earned him the canine's loyalty and friendship. He also became an acquaintance of Dr. Krebs, the creator of the Mystery Machine, who taught him how to drive it. Normally, Shaggy is laid- back and is always hungry. He defends his philosophy of life, in which a person must be open-minded to the universe and to what the universe throws at people. He also believes in numerous gods and deities and is very superstitious. Still, in moments of tension, he is the one that tries to keep the peace between the gang, reminding them that, in order to survive, they have to stick together. * Velma Dinkley ‚Äì Velma Dinkley was a leading scientist in the Nevada Complex. Throughout her life, Velma never had any friends and considered herself as incapable of making them due to her extraordinary intelligence and low social skills. She would later collaborate in a top secret research project called Project Elysium which, through the use of nanites, was supposed to alter mankind's DNA, eliminating mankind's bad and vile instincts. She was also the coordinator of the \\"Smart Dog\\" program, which created Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo. Being quite shy and socially awkward, Velma does not speak very much. Still, with a brilliant and objective mind, and armed with doctorates in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, astrophysics, astronomy, mathematics and engineering, she is usually the one that comes up with theories and plans on how to deal with the numerous monsters that attack her and the rest of the gang. In the time-skip following the death of Fred, she becomes romantically involved with Shaggy and announces that she is pregnant with his child, whom upon birth they name Frederick Rogers-Dinkley after Fred. = Recurring characters = * The Four ‚Äì The Four are Velma's former employers who operate several underground facilities and perform weird scientific experiments. They are revealed to be Velma's older brothers, who positioned themselves in strategic places of a specific field (Hugo Dinkley in the military, Cheeves Dinkley in politics, Quentin Dinkley in the Secret Service and Rufus Dinkley in a research medical company) Velma describes them as a unique mind that shared four bodies when they were younger. Along with Velma, they created Project Elysium and, unknown to her at the time, used Velma's research for their own benefit, plunging the world into an apocalyptic nightmare. * Scrappy-Doo ‚Äì Scrappy-Doo is one of the test subjects of the \\"Smart Dog\\" program at the underground Nevada Complex. Scrappy has two objectives on his mind: upgrading his implants that give him human- like attributes and killing Scooby-Doo, the prototype of the Smart Dog program, who he hates because he sees him as a soft-hearted weakling. He also hates humans, given the experiments that they performed on him. He leads the Scrappy Gang, which is composed of some of the other test subjects of the program, as well as a runaway orphan named Cliffy, who he adopted and has grown fond of ever since. * Daisy Dinkley ‚Äì Daisy is Rufus Dinkley's wife and Velma's sister-in-law. Being Rufus' trophy wife, she was always treated as such, with Rufus always demeaning her. The truth is that Daisy is a lot smarter than she shows and when the gang shows up, she ditches Rufus and goes with them, hoping to find a cure to the nanite apocalypse for which her husband was partly responsible. It is hinted that she has developed feelings for Shaggy. * Cliffy ‚Äì Cliffy is a runaway orphan that Scrappy-Doo adopts while searching for Velma and the rest of the Scooby Gang. * The Nanite King ‚Äì The artificially intelligent being behind Project Elysium and the true mastermind behind the monster apocalypse. Backup stories A serialized, rebooted Secret Squirrel and Morocco Mole story ran in issues #16-29, and a similar Atom Ant story ran in issues #30-36. Secret Squirrel Agent 000 (Secret Squirrel) of the I.S.S. works with Agent Honey Bea of MI6, an ex-girlfriend of his, as well as Morocco Mole (who is now the Chief of the I.S.S., although Secret Squirrel himself does not acknowledge this) to discover who has been killing scientists all over the world and stealing their brains. Atom Ant Atom Ant, as well as a sentient plant named Itty, are auditioning to join the Justice League of America. They are put to the test by different members of the Justice League, each getting three points. Despite Itty actually performing better than Atom Ant and listening to the League members' instructions during each test, the Justice League offers the role to Atom Ant. Before he accepts, Atom Ant sees Itty disappointed, and declines. The League then offers the role to Itty, but Itty also declines. Atom Ant and Itty decide to team up and be a superhero duo together, while the Justice League is stupefied that an ant and a plant both declined membership to the Justice League.

It can happen when a municipality is in a period of economic prosperity and sees that its poorest and most blighted communities are both the cheapest targets for revitalization as well as the areas with the greatest potential for improvement. It is when a city is facing urban decay and chooses to allocate fewer resources to the poorest communities or communities with less political power,A Plague on Your Houses: How New York Was Burned Down and National Public Health Crumbled By Deborah Wallace, Rodrick Wallace. 2001. (Note: fire chief interviewed in the BBC-TV special \\"The Bronx is Burning,\\" in 1976.) and disenfranchised neighborhoods are slated for demolition, relocation, and eventual replacement. Disinvestment in urban and suburban communities tends to fall strongly along racial and class lines and may perpetuate the cycle of poverty exerted upon the space, since more affluent individuals with social mobility can more easily leave disenfranchised areas.  History  = The New Deal and the postwar era = Out of the New Deal came the Public Works Administration, funding the construction of thousands of low-rent homes and infrastructure development. Meanwhile the Homeowners Refinancing Act, as well as the Wagner-Steagall Housing Act three years later, provided generous incentives and reimbursements aimed at Americans recovering from the Great Depression who could not yet afford to invest in equity. In the postwar era, returning veterans were seeking homes to start families.\\"The House We Live In.\\" Race: The Power of an Illusion, episode 3, written by Larry Adelman, edited by Llewellyn M. Smith, PBS, 2003. There was a period of intense residential expansion surrounding major US cities, and banks were gratuitously providing loans in order for families to afford moving there. It is in this new economic landscape where redlining, exclusionary zoning, and predatory lending flourished. The programs enacted during this time provided more displacement than they did replacement: the beginning years of housing and infrastructure development were defined by their clearance and destruction of communities. The Housing Act of 1949 increased the mandate for public housing, but in claiming to combat \\"slums\\" and \\"blight\\" the act was worded so vaguely that those terms could have been applied to most any post-Depression urban neighborhood. What was intended to rebuild in decayed communities was used against poor but otherwise flourishing neighborhoods by labeling them ghettos. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 extended demolition of neighborhoods, with new roads cutting through the most vulnerable neighborhoods in order to create more direct arteries between the metropolitan and the downtown areas. The highway's construction expanded upon the already widening schism of urban poor and the suburban by further enabling white flight and reducing a focus on public transport. = Civil Rights Movement and the Great Society = During the postwar era, municipalities sought to grow enriched and modernized communities from the slums they demolished. As the Civil Rights Movement was in full display through highway revolts and responses to racial violence, there was a growing mindset among urban planners that a communal-focused, people-first approach should be taken, along the same lines as community development handled by the recently-enacted Peace Corps. Lyndon B. Johnson continued the policies of his predecessor John F. Kennedy, and in the first year in office he signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and followed soon after with a series of bills that comprised the foundation of what was termed the \\"War on Poverty\\" and \\"Great Society\\", despite the protesting of a largely anti-integration Congress. The new philosophy of the administration focused intently on Community Action Agencies, fulfilling the demand from modernist social theorists and pouring funding and resources into volunteer forces. The direction of policy was seen as some as a form of direct investment in impoverished and minority neighborhoods, in contrast to the previous focus on new construction. Daniel Patrick Moynihan served as Assistant Secretary of Labor under the Johnson Administration, and was a primary influence on policy development. Stemming from his controversial Moynihan Report, many of the programs enacted within the War on Poverty intended to educate black and poor families in order to modernize their \\"culture.\\" Government assistance, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, was intended for organic community growth, nurturing local governance, and a gradual transition from developing to developed urban regions. However, when shirking programs that were directly- run by municipalities, the money was diverted to smaller, unorthodox community action associations with unions or \\"social protest agendas\\". For example, it was an Office of Economic Opportunity-funded community center where the Black Panther Party started its development. = Change in urban development policy = Johnson responded to the radicalization of Black Americans Watts Riots by ceding control of local OEO's to municipal authorities such as the mayor (a reversal of the original strategy of community-lead development) while funding was reduced and the practices of the offices and local community projects were more closely supervised. Moynihan was startled by what he perceived as the consequences of the War on Poverty and changed his philosophy and its practice under Johnson. He found the social policies of the past decades naive for trying to fix the \\"tangled pathology\\" he described in the white paper he authored for the US Department of Labor, The Negro Family: The Case for National Action. When the administration transitioned over to Nixon, Moynihan remained as Counselor to the President, where he further pushed for dismantling the OEO. Though it continued to exist into the Reagan Administration, the OEO was put under the control of Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, who more tightly controlled its function. It is during this time that Moynihan suggests to Nixon that Black communities be treated with a \\"benign neglect,\\" a philosophy-of-action which would later be translated into the planned shrinkage policies of the 70s and 80s.  Redlining   Exclusionary zoning   Benign neglect  Benign neglect is a policy proposed in 1969 by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was at the time on President Richard Nixon's staff as an urban affairs adviser. While serving in this capacity, he sent the President a memo that suggested, \\"The time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect.' The subject has been too much talked about. The forum has been too much taken over to hysterics, paranoids, and boodlers on all sides. We need a period in which Negro progress continues and racial rhetoric fades.\\"#1579 Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations (1989) The policy was designed to ease tensions after the Civil Rights Movement of the late 1960s. Moynihan was particularly troubled by the speeches of Vice-President Spiro Agnew. However, the policy was widely seen as an abandonment of urban neighborhoods, particularly ones with a majority black population, as Moynihan's statements and writings appeared to encourage, for instance, fire departments engaging in triage to avoid a supposedly futile war against arson.  Planned shrinkage  The large number of fires in the South Bronx after the city slashed fire service there serves as a symbol of planned shrinkage to critics. Planned shrinkage is a controversial public policy of the deliberate withdrawal of city services to blighted neighborhoods as a means of coping with dwindling tax revenues. Planned shrinkage involves decreasing city services such as police patrols, garbage removal, street repairs, and fire protection, from selected city neighborhoods. While it has been advocated as a way to concentrate city services for maximum effectiveness given serious budgetary constraints, it has been criticized as an attempt to \\"encourage the exodus of undesirable populations\\" as well as to open up blighted neighborhoods for development by private interests. Planned shrinkage was mentioned as a development strategy for the South Bronx section of New York City in the 1970s, and more recently for another urban area in the United States, the city of New Orleans. The term was first used in New York City in 1976 by Housing Commissioner Roger Starr.The Living City by Roberta Brandes Gratz. Simon and Schuster 1989. For example, in the South Bronx, many firehouses were closed in the 60s, 70s and 80s. Although, firehouses were shut down all over the city during this period, by 1976 the average number of people per engine was over 44,000 in the South Bronx compared to just 17,000 in Staten Island. Firehouses in the Bronx were closed even as the fire alarm rate rose through the 60s and 70s. Many of these planning decisions can be tracked to models created by the Rand corporation. = Background = During the twentieth century, a boom in suburban growth caused in part by increased automobile use led to urban decline, particularly in the poorer sections of many large cities in the United States and elsewhere. A dwindling tax base depleted many municipal resources. A common view was that it was part of a \\"downward spiral\\" caused first by an absence of jobs, the creation of a permanent underclass, and a declining tax base hurting many city services, including schools. It was this interplay of factors which made change difficult. New York City was described as \\"so broke\\" by the 1970s with neighborhoods which had become \\"so desperate and depleted\\" that municipal authorities wondered how to cope. Some authorities felt the process of decline was inevitable, and instead of trying to fight it, searched for alternatives. According to one view, authorities searched for ways to have the greatest population loss in the areas with the poorest non-white populations. = The RAND report = In the early 1970s, a RAND study examining the relation between city services and large city populations concluded that when services such as police and fire protection were withdrawn, the numbers of people in the neglected areas would decrease. There had been questions about many fires that had been happening in the South Bronx during the 1970s. One account (including the RAND report) suggested that neighborhood fires were predominantly caused by arson, while a contrasting report suggested that arson was not a major cause. If arson had been a primary cause, according to the RAND viewpoint, then it did not make sense financially for the city to try to invest further funds to improve fire protection, according to this view. The RAND report allegedly influenced then Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who used the report's findings to make recommendations for urban policy. In Moynihan's view, arson was one of many social pathologies caused by large cities, and suggested that a policy of benign neglect would be appropriate as a response. = Case studies =  New York City  Myrtle Avenue elevated line in Brooklyn, New York City, was demolished. Pictured is the remaining portion in 1974 Partly in response to the RAND report, and in an effort to address New York's declining population, New York's housing commissioner, Roger Starr, proposed a policy which he termed planned shrinkage to reduce the impoverished population and better preserve the tax base. According to the \\"politically toxic\\" proposal, the city would stop investing in troubled neighborhoods and divert funds to communities \\"that could still be saved.\\" He suggested that the city should \\"accelerate the drainage\\" in what he called the worst parts of the South Bronx through a policy of planned shrinkage by closing subway stations, firehouses and schools. Starr felt these actions were the best way to save money.Breathing Space: A Spiritual Journey in the South Bronx By Heidi B. Neumark Starr's arguments soon became predominant in urban planning thinking nationwide. The people who lived in the communities where his policies were applied protested vigorously; without adequate fire service and police protection, the residents faced waves of crime and fires that left much of the South Bronx and Harlem devastated. A report in 2011 in the New York Times suggested that the planned shrinkage approach was \\"short-lived\\". Under the planned shrinkage program, for example, an abandoned 100-unit development on one piece of land could be cleared by a real estate developer, and such an outcome would have been preferable to ten separate neighborhood-based efforts to produce 100 housing units each, according to advocates of planned shrinkage. According to this view, a planned shrinkage approach would encourage so-called \\"monolithic development\\", resulting in new urban growth but at much lower population densities than the neighborhoods which had existed previously. The remark by Starr caused a political firestorm: then mayor Abraham Beame disavowed the idea while City Council members called it \\"inhuman,\\" \\"racist\\" and \\"genocidal.\\" According to one report, the high inflation during the 1970s combined with the restrictive rent control policies in the city meant that buildings were worth more dead for the insurance money than alive as sources of rental income; as investments, they had limited ability to provide a solid stream of rental income. Accordingly, there was an economic incentive on the part of building owners, according to this view, to simply let the buildings burn. An alternative view was that the fires were a result of the city's municipal policies. While there are differing views about whether planned shrinkage caused fire outbreaks in the 1970s, or was a result of such fires, there is agreement that the fires in the South Bronx during these years were extensive. Patricia Harris, Jimmy Carter and New York Mayor Abraham Beame tour the South Bronx in 1977. By the mid-1970s, the Bronx had 120,000 fires per year, or an average of 30 fires every 2 hours. 40 percent of the housing in the area was destroyed. The response time for fires also increased, as the firefighters did not have the resources to keep responding promptly to numerous service calls. A report in The New York Post suggested that the cause of the fires was not arson but resulted from decisions by bureaucrats to abandon sections of the city. According to one report, of the 289 census tracts within the borough of the Bronx, seven census tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings, and 44 tracts lost more than 50% of their buildings, to fire and abandonment. There have been claims that planned shrinkage impacted public health negatively.Wallace, Rodrick. \\"A synergism of plagues:‚Äúplanned shrinkage,‚Äù contagious housing destruction, and AIDS in the Bronx.\\" Environmental research 47.1 (1988): 1‚Äì33.Wallace, Rodrick, and Deborah Wallace. \\"Origins of public health collapse in New York City: the dynamics of planned shrinkage, contagious urban decay and social disintegration.\\" Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine 66.5 (1990): 391. According to one source, public shrinkage programs targeted to undermine populations of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in the South Bronx and Harlem had an effect on the geographic pattern of the AIDS outbreak. According to this view, municipal abandonment was interrelated with health issues and helped to cause a phenomenon termed \\"urban desertification\\".R. Wallace, \\"Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx.\\" Social Science & Medicine, Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801‚Äì813 ‚Äì abstract retrieved on July 5, 2008 from PubMed The populations in the South Bronx, Lower East Side, and Harlem plummeted during the two decades after 1970. Only after two decades did the city begin to invest in these areas again.  New Orleans  New Orleans differed from other cities in that the cause of decline was not based on economic or political shifts but rather a destructive flood caused by a hurricane. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, planned shrinkage was proposed as a means to create a \\"more compact, more efficient and less flood-prone city\\". Areas of the city which were most damaged by the flooding ‚Äì and thus, most likely to be flooded again ‚Äì would not be rebuilt and would become green space. These areas were frequently less desirable, lower-income areas which had lower property values precisely because of the risk of flooding. Some residents rejected a \\"top- down\\" approach of planned shrinkage of municipal planners and attempted to rebuild in flood-prone areas.  Detroit  The city of Detroit, in the U.S. state of Michigan, has gone through a major economic and demographic decline in recent decades. The population of the city has fallen from a high of 1,850,000 in 1950 to 677,116 in 2015, kicking it off the top 20 of US cities by population for the first time since 1850.Detroit population rank is lowest since 1850, The Detroit News However, the city has a combined statistical area of 5,318,744 people, which currently ranks 12th in the United States. Local crime rates are among the highest in the United States (despite this, the overall crime rate in the city has seen a decline during the 21st century), and vast areas of the city are in a state of severe urban decay. In 2013, Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy case in U.S. history, which it successfully exited on December 10, 2014. Poverty, crime, shootings, drugs and urban blight in Detroit continue to be ongoing problems. median household income is rising,https://www.usnews.com/news/best- states/michigan/articles/2017-09-14/census-figures-show-drop-in-detroit- poverty-rate criminal activity is decreasing by 5% annually as of 2017,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit- city/2017/09/29/detroit-police-crime-statistics/106123962/ and the city's blight removal project is making progress in ridding the city of all abandoned homes that cannot be rehabilitated.  Roxbury, Boston  Planned shrinkage in Roxbury is not unique to the RAND policies enacted in the 70s and 80s. The area succumbed to numerous fires as out-of-town landlords sought out the only way to earn back some profit on homes that no longer sold. However, the neighborhood's response to planned shrinkage through community action has made it an example to other neighborhoods of the success of people-first organizing. The neighborhood had worked with the Boston's administration, but refused to give in to bureaucratic control by the city, protesting whenever the municipality neglected their redevelopment.Mahan, L., Lipman, M., Neuburger, J., Ragazzi, C., & Holding Ground Productions. (1996). Holding ground: The rebirth of Dudley Street. Boston: Holding Ground Productions.  \\"Shrink to survive\\"  \\"Shrink to survive\\" is a contemporary form of planned shrinkage which emphasizes short-term razing of the city: Where a city enacting planned shrinkage policies takes a Laissez-faire approach to disinvesting in its communities, cities can take an active role in that reduction. This includes investing in more aggressive land buyback and enforcement of eminent domain in order to obtain ownership of a property, relocate its residents, and demolish it. Shrink to survive is used in cities with a large number of abandoned buildings, such as this home in Detroit. Such proposals, which began around 2009, entail razing entire districts within some cities or else bulldozing them to return the land to its pre-construction rural state. The policies have been studied not only by municipal and state authorities but also by the federal government, and may affect dozens of declining cities in the United States. One report suggested that 50 U.S. cities were potential candidates, and include Detroit, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Memphis. Proponents claim the plan will bring efficiency with less waste and fraud; detractors complain the policy has been a \\"disaster\\" and advocate for community-based efforts instead. = Flint = Shrink to survive was initiated by Dan Kildee during his term as Treasurer of Genesee County, Michigan. He proposed it as a way to handle municipal problems in Flint, which had experienced an exodus of people and business during the automobile industry downturn. Flint had been described as one of the poorest Rust Belt cities. One estimate was that its population had declined by half since 1950. In 2002, authorities established a \\"municipal land bank\\" to buy abandoned or foreclosed homes to prevent them from being bought up by real estate speculators. One report was that by the summer of 2009, 1,100 homes in Flint had been bulldozed and that another 3,000 had been scheduled for demolition. One estimate was that the city's size would shrink by twenty per cent, while a second estimate was that it needed to contract by 40% to once again become viable financially. = Shrink to survive in other cities = Shrink to survive has been enacted in other medium-sized cities in the American Rust belt such as the Michigan city Benton Harbor, as well as the Ohio city of Youngstown. One report suggested that city authorities in Youngstown had demolished 2,000 derelict homes and businesses. In addition, shrink-to-survive has been considered for inner city suburbs of Detroit. Municipal authorities in Gary, Indiana are considering plans to shrink the city by 40%, possibly by demolition or possibly by letting Nature overgrow abandoned buildings, as a way to raise values for existing structures, reduce crime, and restore the city to fiscal health.Nick Bogert, June 19, 2013, NBC News, Battered city of Gary, Ind., considers shrinking 40 percent to save itself, Accessed June 19, 2013 The city has suffered a sustained decline in job losses and a consequent housing bust.

The hospital is a member of the Eastern Health network, and is located near a number of medical facilities that support the hospital, such as Angliss House and Chandler House. History The hospital was originally named William Angliss Hospital and then changed to Angliss Hospital. It was established in 1939 and named after Sir William Charles Angliss, a respected local politician and philanthropist who contributed financially to the hospital's foundation. The Angliss family continued to play a significant role in the hospitals growth and management, well into the 20th Century. In 1945 a decision was made to relocate the hospital due to increased demand, and in 1958, Lady Angliss opened the hospital in its now present location. Funding from the Angliss' charitable foundation allowed for the hospital to build an additional 27 beds in 1965. In 2010 the hospital celebrated the 85,000th birth to have occurred at the hospital. Facilities The Angliss Hospital is considered a medium metropolitan hospital by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and has an Emergency Department, Radiology, Midwifery, Intensive Care, Obstetric, Paediatric and Rehabilitation departments. In addition to these facilities, the hospital operates the aged care facility located on adjacent Edward Street. The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Angliss Hospital was completed in 2018, at a cost of $20 million, adding 14 intensive care beds to the hospital as well as a new short-stay expansion of the hospital's emergency department. Future expansion In 2018, the recently re-elected Andrews government pledged to expand the hospital with an additional 25 hospital beds. The planned expansion is considered an extension of the most recent development at the hospital completed in 2018, which added an intensive care unit to the hospital and a fourth floor. The cost of the expansion is around $170 million and includes an additional 120 beds at a nearby aged care facility.

His work has been shown in Italy, France, Belgium, Yugoslavia, United States, South Korea, Austria, Hungary, Spain, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica and Venezuela. Most of Venezuelan national museums present permanent exhibits including Caracas' Museo de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Museum) and Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo (Caracas Contemporary Art Museum). Carlos Medina currently works in Caracas and Paris. Carlos Medina is known for his minimalist geometric compositions and large spatial interventions in combination with sculpture techniques and plastic arts.  Education  Carlos Medina was born in 1953 in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. After finishing his art studies in 1975 in the Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas Crist√≥bal Rojas de Caracas (School of Plastic Arts Cristobal Rojas), he produced his first large exposition in the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo where he presented geometric works in iron assembly carved from Cumarebo limestone. In 1977, he was granted the fellowships by the Italian government and FUNDARTE (Fundaci√≥n para la Cultura y las Artes). He spent seven years in Italy developing professional skills in carving, lathing, and 3D modeling by participating in workshops with Carlo Andrei from Gonari Marmi in the industry, crafting bronze sculptures in Pietrasanta Fonderia Artistica Mariani and attending courses in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara. He received the 1975 Sculpture Prize in the 4th National Salon of Young Artists organized by the National Institute of Culture and Fine Arts (INCIBA) at Caracas, the Carrara City Honors in 1978 and the Critical Art Association Award (AICA), Venezuela in 1984. Throughout his training, Carlos Medina studied graphical techniques in the Frans Masereel Centrum in Belgium and frequents different workshops of sculptors like S√©rgio de Camargo, Gi√≤ Pomodoro, Alicia Penalba and Gonzalo Fonseca.  Work  In 1984 he returned to Caracas where he presents the exhibition Esculturas, a series of more than 30 sculptures in granite, marble and travertine, with the addition of around 30 engravings and drawings using black and gold India ink. This exposition has been presented in the Museo de Bellas Artes and the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo in Caracas, as well as in the main arts museums of other cities like Barquisimeto, Porlamar and Maracay. Later he developed relationships with the great masters of the Venezuelan art Alejandro Otero, Jes√∫s Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez, who through their exchanges motivate him to orient his investigations towards a challenging intervention of the space. In the following decades he developed more than twenty large scale sculptures: Fragmentos de lluvia (Rain fragments) is a recurrent project that dates from 1989 and culminates in 2014 with a large scale replica as gift to the city of Caracas. It consist of seven metallic droplets of 6 meters high, now in open air by the side of the Francisco de Miranda Freeway, one of the main routes of the capital. The works of Carlos Medina also integrates the public domain including Caracas Metro, SIDOR, and a variety of public squares and commercial centers in the national territory. From 2012 he started the Essentials concept in the MUSA (Museo de las Artes de Guadalajara), Mexico. The exposition has been presented in Panama City and Miami. It covers a series of delicate almost-geometrical structures constructed with the use of different techniques of blacksmith‚Äôs workshop, carpentry, laser cutting and refinery of PVC sheets. Recurrent themes are based on abstract depiction of tears/droplets, surfaces and neutrinos (spherical atoms) suspended in three dimensional spaces. ArtNexus summarizes his work as: the possi-bility of expressing through matter that which transcends the matter itself, the very essence of objects manifested only in the presence of objects. Carlos Medina's career has been awarded with several distinctions. In 1993 he won the grand prize of Sal√≥n Michelena LI edition and the Sculptor Prize in Argentina, in addition to the Honorific Mention in the I Biennale of Guadalajara (2008) and the 2014 Sculpture Prize from Venezuelan Association of Plastic Artists (AVAP) .

He previously played as a rifler/lurker for Cloud9, before going inactive. n0thing is one of the most experienced North American players. Before playing Global Offensive, n0thing was a professional Counter Strike 1.6 player. Jordan won his first LAN tournament at just 10 years old. Since then, he has grown into a major figure in the CS:GO scene. In fact, his large following has garnered him popularity that has allowed him to gain exposure outside of the CS:GO scene, even appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.  Career  = Counter-Strike 1.6 = During Counter Strike 1.6, n0thing was best known as the star player on Evil Geniuses, who signed him in March 2008. He was nominated from the North American region as Best Newcomer in 2008, and the eSports Player of the Year in 2008 and 2009. In 2011, he was named as the 11th best player of the previous year in a ranking by HLTV. This was based on his performance in 2010, which included leading his team to victory in seasons 5‚Äì7 of ESEA League's Invitational tournaments and finishing second at both Intel Extreme Masters American Championship Finals and the World Cyber Games's Pan-American Championship. During his time playing 1.6, n0thing was one of the players who participated in DirecTV's failed Championship Gaming Series. = Counter-Strike: Global Offensive = n0thing previously competed for CompLexity Gaming, an outfit acquired by Cloud9 on July 30, 2014. In the summer of 2015, n0thing's team made the grand finals of three tournaments in a month. After the departure of three of his teammates, including ingame leader Sgares, after that successful Summer 2015 run, n0thing stepped in as IGL until replaced by Slemmy before DreamHack Open Austin 2016. In May 2016, n0thing had a highlight play against Luminosity Gaming in ELEAGUE Season 1's group stage final, where he snuck through a deployed smoke grenade, killed Luminosity's sniper with his pistol, and then picked up the dropped rifle to eliminate half of the enemy team. Although they lost the group stage finals 2-1, they advanced to the playoffs when Luminosity was subsequently disqualified. In October 2016, n0thing's Cloud9 team became the first North American team since 2006 to win a major tournament, after they won ESL Pro League Season 4 and US$200,000 over SK Gaming. Despite n0thing having played Counter-Strike professionally for his entire adult life, it was his first time winning a major international CS:GO tournament. In November 2016, n0thing's performance against OpTic Gaming at Dreamhack Winter 2016 led Cloud9 to 2-0 their North American counterparts and start their run in the loser's bracket. In December 2016, n0thing's performance in the Americas Minor against Team SoloMid helped Cloud9 make the major qualifier for the ELEAGUE Major 2017. Outside of competitive play, n0thing created a dance move based around the flashbang grenade animations in the game. In 2014, he was a notable victim of a Swatting hoax while he was live streaming, an incident that was covered in an episode of French television show L'Effet Papillon on Canal+. n0thing also makes videos instructing viewers on how to improve at playing Counter-Strike.

At the time he belonged to the Congress Socialist Party, but he was known for shifting party affiliations frequently. A.M.A. Zaman was involved in different trade unions. He was a leader of Jute mill workers during the struggle for independence. Whereas many other leaders hailed from the bhadralok, upper classes, A.M.A. Zaman hailed from a working-class background and had been a jute mill worker himself. In the midst of the 1936-1937 labour unrest he founded a jute mill workers union, which was registered in 1936. In July 1937 A.M.A. Zaman was convicted of rioting at a strike in the Wellington Jute Mills in Rishra, but thousands of Hooghly workers turned to the streets to demand his release. A.M.A. Zaman was one of the key speakers of the mass labour rally in Calcutta of 29 July 1937. In December 1937 he was elected general secretary of the Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress. However, his influence in Hooghly decreased as sardars and babus disseminated a rumour that he had taken a bribe from mill management. A.M.A. Zaman left the CSP in 1939, after which the party ceased to be influential in Hooghly District. He belonged to the grouping that opposed Indrajit Gupta's influence in the BPTUC.

It is a benthopelagic predatory fish with a bioluminescent organ on its ventral surface. The glowbelly is an important food fish in some areas. Description Acropoma japonicum has a moderately elongated and compressed body with a covering of large scales which are deciduous. It has two light-producing organs, photophores in the abdominal muscle which run from the thorax to just past the anus, these are connected at the end nearest the fish's head. The dorsal fin of the glowbelly has 9 spines in its anterior portion with 10 soft rays behind them while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of . Distributuion Acropoma japonicum has a wide distribution in the Indo- Pacific region and it can be found from the eastern coast of Africa through the Indian Ocean and into the western Pacific Ocean as far north as Japan. Habitat and biology Acropoma japonicum is a marine species with a depth range of It inhabits sand and sandy mud bottoms. This is a predatory species in which the smaller individuals feed on copepods and caridean shrimp while the larger fish fed on those groups too but also preying on small fishes and krill. This species is unusual in having what appears to be a short life cycle for a predatory fish, the juvenile fish begin to settle at the end of the breeding season and are sexually mature by the start of the following breeding season. As the breeding season progresses the body condition of the males worsens and as a result they have a higher mortality than the females. Most fish do not survive beyond their first breeding season and females dominate older age classes. The older age classes may also migrate to deeper waters. Abstract Human usage Acropoma japonicum is an important food fish which is a bycatch in Korean waters but in Japan it is used in the commercial manufacture of fishcakes. It is also used to make fishmeal. This species is also of ecological importance as it is an important constituent of the diet of many commercially important fish species. Taxonomy Acropoma japonicum was first formally described in 1859 by the German born british zoologist Albert G√ºnther (1830-1914) with the type locality being given as the \\"Japanese Sea\\". When G√ºnther described it he placed it in a monotypic genus, Acropoma and so this species is the type species of that genus. A number of new species have been described in the 2000s in the genus Acropoma, for example the glowblellies around Australia have been named as Acropoma leobergi.

The book chronicles the life of Chabon's grandfather, a WW2 soldier, engineer and rocket enthusiast who marries a troubled Jewish survivor from France and lives a challenging, wandering life in postwar America. Chabon tells the story using a mixture of strict memoir and creative fiction writing. The narrator functions as a proxy for the author, Chabon.  Plot summary  The novel is about the story of the author's (Chabon) grandfather. Throughout the book, the grandfather's name is not referred to. The story is sort of a memoir, jumping around in time. It starts with the narrator stating how his grandfather got arrested. Reception Sam Sacks writing for The Wall Street Journal appreciated the non-fiction elements of the novel in contrast to Chabon's other works. Sacks said, \\"Moonglow is a movingly bittersweet novel that balances wonder with lamentation.\\" For The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani found that, \\"Mr. Chabon weaves these knotted-together tales together into a tapestry that‚Äôs as complicated, beautiful and flawed as an antique carpet.

After Hunt's death, his subordinate and close friend, Lt.Harry Morant, responded with a series of revenge killings of both POWs and many local civilians. This led directly to the Court-martial of Breaker Morant, one of the first war crimes prosecutions in British military history.  Early life  Hunt was born on May 28, 1873 in Pau, France. He joined the British Army on 2 July 1894 and received a commission in the York and Lancaster Regiment. On 9 December 1894, he transferred to the 13th Hussars as a 2nd Lieutenant. Less than two years later, Hunt resigned his Commission. Arthur Davey (1987), Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers, Van Riebeeck Society, Cape Town. Page xlii. According to South African historian Arthur Davey, \\"During the South African War his service was with irregular units,in his first tour of duty with French's Scouts. After the occupation of Pretoria in June 1900 he was one of several officers on the staff of the Military Governor who undertook civil duties, his own assignment being that of a marriage officer. After a holiday in England he returned to the war theatre and was re-engaged in the newly established South African Mounted Irregular Force. With effect on 16 June 1901 he was promoted to a captaincy in the BVC.\\" Arthur Davey (1987), Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers, Van Riebeeck Society, Cape Town. Page xlii.  Friendship with Harry Morant  Hunt and Morant are likely to have met in Pretoria sometime between July-November 1900, just after Morant's service in the South Australian Mounted Rifles had been completed. They developed a friendship over time, and eventually Hunt invited Morant to join the recently formed, Bushveldt Carbineers in April, 1901.  Death  =Prelude= At the end of July 1901, the garrison at Fort Edward received a visit from the Reverend Fritz Reuter of the Berlin Missionary Society and his family. Rev. Reuter was assigned to the Medingen Mission Station and, despite later claims by his family, he \\"seems to have been an exception\\" to the generally Republican sympathies \\"of the Zoutpansberg German population\\". In conversation with Captain Hunt, Rev. Reuter reported that Field cornet Barend Viljoen's Letaba Commando was present at Duivelskloof and had been \\"harassing local noncombatant farmers\\". Rev. Reuter further alleged that his own mission station had been threatened. In response, Captain Hunt ordered a detachment under BVC Sergeant A.B.C. Cecil to protect the missionary and his family on their return journey. Charles Leach (2012), The Legend of Breaker Morant is Dead and Buried, Louis Trichardt. Pages 37-38. After Rev. Reuter's intelligence had been confirmed by a Native runner, Captain Hunt also learned that Sergeant Cecil's patrol had been ambushed near the Medingen Mission Station. In response, the captain departed Fort Edward on 2 August 1901 with the intention of ambushing the Viljoen Commando. In addition to service personnel of the Bushveldt Carbineers, the patrol included Tony Schiel, a defector from the Zoutpansberg Commando and Intelligence Scout for Captain Alfred Taylor.Leach (2012), pages 38-39. It was to be Schiel's task to command between 300 and 400 irregulars drawn from the local Lobedu people. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt had received \\"warnings and expressions of caution\\" regarding \\"the wisdom of attacking an enemy position at night\\" without normal reconnaissance of the place. Deciding to proceed anyway, Captain Hunt led \\"his patrol into a situation that would echo through the next 100 years.\\"Leach (2012), pages 39-40. =Ambush= According to the diary of BVC Trooper J.S. Silke, Rev. Reuter warned Captain Hunt against attacking. The Viljoen farmhouse, he explained, was built on a rocky hillside and \\"was unassailable\\". Furthermore, the nearby Botha farmhouse contained more than 40 armed men who could easily cut off the Bushveldt Carbineers' line of retreat. Despite the missionary's warnings and the fact that it was a bright moonlit night, Captain Hunt chose to attack anyway.Leach (2012), pages 40-43. After planning a two-pronged attack, Captain Hunt ordered Trooper Silke to wait for a signal shot and rush the farmhouse from behind with 50 Lobedu warriors. Then, Captain Hunt approached the farmhouse via the concrete steps terraced into the hillside. According to the memoirs of Hendrik Adriaan Jacobs, the Viljoen Commando knew that an attack was coming. The Commando's members, however, were \\"feverish\\" from the effects of malaria and fatalistically waited for the arrival of the Bushveldt Carbineers. Jacobs later recalled how he saw Hunt's party through a window and began shooting. Possibly mistaking Jacobs' first shot for the signal, the BVC and the Lobedu also began shooting and general pandemonium ensued. In an exchange of fire, Captain Hunt was shot through the chest. Anglo-African Bushveldt Carbineers Sergeant Frank Eland was killed while attempting to go to Hunt's aid, as was at least one Lobedu warrior. On the Boer side, Barend Viljoen, his brother J.J. Viljoen, and G. Hartzenberg were killed. The dead of both sides were left behind by their retreating comrades.Leach (2012), pages 40-45. =Aftermath= When the surviving members of the patrol returned to Medingen Mission Station, Rev. Reuter asked them about their officers and \\"was told a confusing and contradictory story of what had happened\\". Decades later, Rev. Reuter's daughter recalled in a televised interview, \\"My father roused on them, asking how they could leave their Captain like that.\\"Leach (2012), page 43. The body of Captain Hunt was later found stripped, with his neck broken, his face stomped on with a hobnailed boot, and with his legs slashed with a knife. Davey (1987), page xliii. According to South African historian Charles Leach, however, Captain Hunt's broken neck would be consistent with a fall down the concrete steps after being shot in the chest. The mutilations found on his body were also found on the bodies of the three dead Boers. Both sides blamed the other for the disfigurement of the dead. Viljoen Commando member Hendrik Jacobs, however, believed that Lobedu witch-doctors were to blame. According to historian Charles Leach, accounts by French anthropologist Henri Junod reveal that the traditional practice of the Lobedu people was to disembowel dead and dying warriors on the battlefield in order to set their spirits free.Leach (2012), pages 44-51. The body of Captain Percy Hunt was buried at the Medingen Mission Station, after a brual service was read over his body by Rev. Fritz Reuter. A cross was later installed at the Captain's grave by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Sergeant Eland was buried at his family's nearby homestead, the Ravenshill Farm, after a burial service was also read over him by Rev. Reuter. Captain Hunt's death was reported in the Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser on 19 August 1901. Legacy Hunt was allegedly engaged to a woman whose sister was engaged to Morant. Hunt's death at the hands of the Viljoen Commando inspired a series of revenge killings which led to Morant's Court-martial and execution.R. K. Todd, 'Morant, Harry Harbord (Breaker) (1864‚Äì1902)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/morant-harry-harbord-breaker-7649/text13377, published first in hardcopy 1986, accessed online 1 December 2016. According to South African historian Arthur Davey, \\"...Hunt was only 28 when he was killed and therefore younger than his subordinates, Morant and Handcock, and only a year older than the hapless Witton. His tenure as a junior officer in the regular army had been short and it can be supposed that his knowledge of military law was limited. At the courts-martial several witnesses, Sergeant S. Robertson and Lieutenants Morant, Handcock, and Picton mentioned that Hunt had given orders that no prisoners should be taken. Ex-Captain Robertson, giving evidence at the trial of Lenehan, stated that he, Taylor, and Hunt had known the truth about the death of Trooper van Buuren which had been concealed 'in the interest of the corps.' As the Heese case shows, the veracity of Morant and Handcock is suspect, whilst Captain Robertson was a man who had turned King's Evidence, so Hunt's reputation remains, as it were, in limbo.\\" Davey (1987), pages xlii-xliii. In popular culture In the award-winning 1980 film Breaker Morant, Captain Percy Frederick Hunt, who was renamed Simon Hunt, was played by Anglo-Australian actor Terence Donovan. The character was depicted as much older than the real Hunt and was performed with an Australian rather than an English accent.

In 1853 he described the preparation and use of quinine.P. Briquet (1853) Trait√© th√©rapeutique du quinquina et de ses preparations from Internet Archive He published Trait√© clinique et th√©rapeutique de l‚ÄôHyst√©rie in 1859, and the following year he was admitted to the Academie de Medecine.

Familial Relationship between Sociopathy and Hysteria (Briquet's Syndrome)\\", British Journal of Psychiatry 127:23-32. is classified as somatic symptom disorder. He first described this in 1859. \\"Although many of his theoretical concepts, basic scientific knowledge and data processing techniques were primitive by our standards, his approach, his emphasis on demonstrable facts, and his many well-substantiated conclusions mark his Treatise on Hysteria as an avant-garde work relevant even today\\" Francois M. Mai (1982) \\"The forgotten avant-garde\\", Trends in Neurosciences 5: 67,8 Briquet was a proponent of male hysteria in his Treatise. He cites Louyer-Villermay, M. Dubois, M. Landouzy, and M. Monneret as putting to rest the doubt over male hysteria.P. Briquet (1859) Trait√© clinique et th√©rapeutique de l‚ÄôHyst√©rie from Gallica He wrote, \\"Regardless of the denials, men may suffer from hysteria, and the cases that prove it are not rare, and it is only possible to prevent it by acknowledging that.\\" As a mental condition, hysteria is not due to uterine influence: \\"Hysteria may occur in men, who have no uterus, in non-menstruating young women whose uterus is still in a rudimentary state and where it remains without influence, and in old women where it no longer influences.\\" Briquet describes circumstances where simultaneously the senses are excited, and efforts are made to conceal the excitation, as precursors to hysteria. In Mark Micale‚Äôs reading of Briquet‚Äôs Treatise,Mark S. Micale (2009) Hysterical Men: the hidden history of Male Nervous Illness, Harvard University Press the introductory section on male hysteria is followed by prejudice against the male victims of the disorder. :Briquet chooses to begin the main body of his book with a 40-page discussion of hysteria in the adult male ‚Äì the very first discussion of its kind in a nineteenth-century medical text. :By the end of Briquet's long and authoritative exposition, an adult man capable of \\"affective impressions\\" is seen as not only sick and abnormal, but also as a deviation from, and menace to, the bourgeois family order. Apart from the gender factor, Briquet studied the epidemiology of hysteria through 430 patients that he attended over a decade of clinical work. Micale describes the anticipation of affective neuroscience: :[Briquet centers] hysteria in the brain, conjecturing that a part of the human brain is reserved for emotional or \\"affective sensations\\", as opposed to motor control and intellectual operations. He then specifies that \\"hysteria is an illness consisting of a neurosis of the part of the brain destined to receive affective impressions and feelings\\". He goes on to maintain that the disorder is caused by the complex and highly individual interaction of many disparate factors, including age, gender, emotional disposition, family history, mode of education, previous physical illness and psychological stress. The malady develops temperamentally, he claims, in individuals with an \\"affective predominance\\". In his 2004 history of mental illness, Theodore Millon noted Briquet's advances: :[Briquet] speculated on untoward developmental and life experiences as playing a pathogenic role (e.g. parental mistreatment, spousal abuse, unfavorable employment circumstances, or business failures). Recognizing that only a small subset of those subjected to these psychosocial experiences developed the hysterical syndrome, Briquet proposed predispositions as pathogenic factors. Aware that life circumstances troubled his patients, he suggested that many would benefit by speaking to an empathetic counselor or physician who might serve as a confidant. Briquet showed great sensitivity in going beyond the crude medications of the day to employ a psychotherapeutic approach to his patients' difficulties.Theodore Millon (2004) Masters of the Mind, page 170, John Wiley & Sons References * De l‚ÄôHyperesth√©sie de hyst√©rique et notamment de hyperesth√©sie de muscles chez les hyst√©riques ** Citation at Bibliotheque nationale de France * Pierre Briquet from Redepsi 1796 births 1881 deaths 19th- century French physicians French psychiatrists ","title":"Paul Briquet"},{"id":"52439374","text":"Suzan Wooduff (born Phoenix, Arizona) is an American abstract painter, currently living and working in Los Angeles.

Biography Semra Ertan was born on 31 May 1956, in Mersin, Turkey. She was the daughter of Gani Bilir and Vehbiye Bilir, who lived in Kiel and Hamburg as foreign workers. She moved to Germany at the age of 15, with her sisters following a little later. In addition to working as an interpreter, she wrote more than 350 poems and political satires. Devoted to lyricism, one of her most notable poems, \\"Mein Name ist Ausl√§nder\\" (My name is foreigner), was published in Turkish school books. She also published books in Germany regarding the \\"emotional and physical effects that loneliness, deprivation, and alienation have on immigrants\\". A few days before her 26th birthday, Ertan called the broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk to announce she would be committing suicide by self-immolation. She explained her motive as a response to growing xenophobia in Germany. The public self-immolation occurred in the early morning hours at the intersection of Simon-von-Utrecht-Strasse and Detlef-Bremer-Stra√üe in Hamburg's St. Pauli quarter.Hamburger Abendblatt, 1 June 1982 Ertan doused herself with of gasoline that she had purchased at a petrol station that morning and ignited it. Coincidentally, a police unit was marching past the marketplace at the time and attempted to smother the flames with blankets. However, Erten died in hospital due to extensive burns. Ertan's perception of increasing xenophobia was confirmed by statistical data and sociological studies. In November 1978, 39% of Germans demanded that foreigners return to their home countries, while two months before Ertan's death, 68% of West Germans were of this opinion.Harenberg, Chronik des 20. Jahrhunderts. S. 1183 (in German) In addition, violence against foreigners in 1982 was no longer an isolated phenomenon. Furthermore, foreigners were increasingly excluded from social life in the country, and contact with them by the Germans was avoided to the extent possible. With unemployment and housing shortages in Germany, migrant workers were increasingly seen by Germans as competitors to the workplace and living space. Legacy German novelist Sten Nadolny credited the genesis of his 1990 novel Selim oder Die Gabe der Rede (Selim or the Gift of Speech) to Ertan's suicide. The novel's protagonist, Ayse, is a fictionalized version of Ertan. German investigative journalist G√ºnter Wallraff dedicated his 1985 book Ganz unten (The Lowest of the Low), which examined his experience posing as a Turkish guest worker in Germany, inter alia, to Semra Ertan. Semra Ertan, a 2013 documentary produced by Cana Bilir-Meier, screened at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen and received the Innovative Film Award at the YOUKI International Youth Media Festival Austria.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the Japanese government launched the Japanization towards the Chinese people in Taiwan, which also resulted in the eviction of the association from the building in 1938. In 1938-1945, the building was used by the Xinmin Society (), a pro-Japanese organization based in Peking.

The contributing buildings include the Shimer-Boehringer-Lange Cottage, which is composed of three sections. The original part of the house Is the Shriner cottage that was built on this property sometime before 1887. The Lange's moved in when they bought the property and raised their seven children here.
