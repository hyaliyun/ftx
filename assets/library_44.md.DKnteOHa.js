The Travco design originally emerged as a 1961 model called the \\"Dodge Frank Motor Home\\" and marketed with the assistance of the Chrysler Corporation, which was the maker of its chassis. One hundred thirty one were produced the first year, with an average price tag of $9000. The Travco/Dodge Motor Home design and fiberglass body were refinements by Ray Frank to the original Frank Motor Home, a conventional box-type design based on the Dodge chassis and built in Brown City, Michigan from 1958 to 1962. Ray Frank, founder of Frank Industries, also made up the name \\"motorhome\\" and went on to develop Xplorer Motorhomes. Frank has been inducted into the RV/MH Hall of Fame & Museum (RV/MH Heritage Foundation, Elkhart Indiana) as the father of the motorhome. Travco enjoyed a large market share of the budding motorhome market. Its success played a part in the demise of more established makes such as the Corvair-powered UltraVan, and opened the market to lower-cost makes such as Winnebago. Travco's use of the Dodge Motor Home chassis established Dodge chassis as the most popular make of motorhome chassis for twenty years. The original Dodge Motorhome Chassis used for the Travco, and many other makes, was powered by the Chrysler 318 \\"Polysphere\\" engine. Many heavy duty refinements were made to this outstanding small engine to increase its durability for hauling the heavy motorhome body. GVWs could exceed six tons, but the small and efficient 318 engine with the distinctive parabolic combustion chamber design netting around 200 horsepower could manage to keep up with traffic, and had a top speed of slightly over 70 mph in most configurations. The 318, and later 413 and 440 engines, were mated to the Chrysler Torqueflite 727 transmission; until the 1964 model, these transmissions shared the \\"pushbutton\\" selector quadrant used on other Chrysler Corporation vehicles. From 1965 on, Torqueflite used an instrument panel‚Äìmounted selector lever similar to the Corvair Powerglide. All Dodge motorhome chassis engines were specially improved \\"truck\\" versions, that operated on regular gasoline, with special durability features such as improved valves and stress-relieved castings and forged crankshafts. The Dodge chassis utilized a live dual rear wheel axle and an \\"I\\"-beam front axle suspended on semi-elliptic leaf springs at both ends. Travco offered a variety of lengths and floorplans over the years; its 27-foot model was the most popular. The Travco Corporation challenged the tax law on RV chassis, which were considered \\"trucks\\" and taxed at a higher rate than private motor vehicles. Travco won its case in 1971, and the IRS-accepted Motorhome Chassis would be taxed at the lower rate. This was a significant victory that served all manufacturers in the industry. The 1962 Dodge Motor Home (later Travco) design was revolutionary due to its shape and fiberglass-over-steel construction, thus eliminating paint jobs and dry rot. It was sold as the Frank Motor Home from 1958 to 1963 until the company went bankrupt. Two investors bought the RV body molds and patent rights, and opened Travco Corporation a short time after, incorporating as PRF Industries. A little- known fact is that Travco's sister company, Gemini, built the interiors of the GMC Motorhome between 1973 and 1974 in Mt. Clemens, MI. Production of GMC Motorhome interiors shifted to GM's own factory in Pontiac, MI with the 1975 models. History In 1964, Travco Corporation (contraction of \\"Travelers Company\\") took control, the windows were enlarged and various other cosmetic modifications were added. The mid-1960s Travco was offered in six color combinations. The design changed very little from 1964 to 1980 except for a choice of grille designs that hurt the look of the well-designed RV. Five sizes were offered; the 21-foot 210, 22-foot 220, the 27-foot 270, the 29-foot 290, and the 32-foot 320. Out of the five, the 270 was the best seller, and the best selling color in the 1960s was white with a red band running lengthwise around the center. The popular colors in the 1970s were any shade of earth tone with or without a two-tone. Eventually, the \\"Atomic Age\\" design failed to impress most buyers, despite the more modern-looking grille introduced in the mid-1970s. As part of the loan guarantees to the Chrysler Corporation during its financial crisis in the late 1970s, Chrysler was told to abandon the medium duty truck market (including the Dodge Motorhome Chassis) and concentrate on building light trucks; International Harvester was told to do the reverse, and get out of light trucks and concentrate on medium and heavy duty vehicles as part of their agreement with the US federal government. This stopped production of both the very popular Dodge chassis, the 440 ci big-block V8, and contributed to the demise of the Travco, which was identified strongly with the Chrysler Corporation. Other factors, including management changes and extraordinarily high fuel costs and interest rates in the 1979-era contributed to Travco's difficulties. However, the body shells were used by a luxury-RV maker called Foretravel until around 1990. The Travco body-shell molds have probably been destroyed, so no more replacement body parts will be made. Body molds for some of the mid to late 70s Class A and the Lspirit are listed for sale on the Facebook Dodge Travco Lovers Page. They have pictures and not all of them have been destroyed as previously thought. In a side note, Travco also offered van conversions called \\"Family Wagons\\"Dodge A-Series Travco Family Wagons (McLellan's Automotive) as well as class C Minihomes called \\"Family Wagon\\", with aluminum sides similar to Winnebago's \\"Minnie winnie\\", and a fiberglass version called \\"L'Esprit\\".1977 Travco Parade (MyTravco.com) Travco motorhomes, regarded as among the very best in the industry in contemporary reports and now considered a classic RV on par with Airstream, Avion, Silver Streak, Sportscoach and Spartan, were owned by both the famous and ordinary families. The country music star Johnny Cash owned and toured in several Travcos (many of which are included in documentaries and films about him) over the course of his career; William Shatner of Star Trek had a specially customized 1979 Travco with four wheel drive. Travco was considered a leader in the industry, and was the first manufacturer to create a vehicle that defined the modern day motorhome. Almost every feature regarded as typical of the class A motorhome originated with Travco and its Dodge Motor Home/Frank motorhome predecessors, from central air conditioning, to self-contained electricity generation, to a toilet (\\"Destroilet\\") that incinerated its own waste. In a recent survey of all-time highest quality and desirable makes of RV on the RV.net website, Travco models were in the top three postwar RV manufacturers. Even within the Travco company, their product was affectionately referred to as \\"the tank\\"‚Äîa reflection of its toughness and stout lifetime construction. Interiors Early Travco coach interiors were arguably the most well-made and practical. Upholstery pieces featured simple patterns in durable vinyl. Carpets and interior trim were functional and durable. The mid-70s and the 80s brought twin swivel chairs under a crank-out bunk bed. A dinette table was located across the way, with cabinets above, and the kitchen was fully equipped with not only the expected four-burner range/oven, double-door refrigerator and double sink, but some even came with built-in toasters and coffee pots. Interior fabrics and floor coverings were more ornate. The bathroom was large, and it was fully equipped with marine toilet, sink, and shower. A large closet was across from that. A tiny bedroom with bed, a mirror, and numerous storage areas occupied the rear end of the motorhome. Over the years, floorplans varied from the luxury 27 foot \\"Dodge Mahal\\" in the early 1970s which offered posh comfort intended for just two, to family floor plans sleeping up to ten. The \\"SightSeer\\" economy motorhome was a basic, stripped down and shorter model directed at the economy market typified by Winnebago. Sightseer was a conventional box-style motorhome that did not share the distinctive flowing aerodynamic Travco signature body style.  In popular culture  A fourth- season episode of The Donna Reed Show titled \\"The Caravan\\" which premiered on May 10, 1962, extensively showcased a 1962 Dodge Travco. As the Stone family travels west on vacation the Travco is shown in a variety of locations on the Columbia Pictures/Screen Gems backlot as well in numerous live action sequences along the Las Vegas strip and at the Riviera (hotel and casino). Throughout the show Donna and the Stone family affectionately refer to the Travco as \\"our house bus\\". Charles Kuralt and his On the Road crew for CBS News traveled about the country in a motorhome from 1967 to 1994 to come up with unique feature stories that appeared on the CBS Evening News and later on the CBS News Sunday Morning program, also hosted by Kuralt. One of the motorhomes used by the On the Road crew was a Travco.

Located on the western outskirts of the modern-day suburban town of Raheen, it was operational from 1882 until 1974 when it closed as a school for the last time. The college produced over 1000 priests in that period. It had previously been an agricultural college and a Limerick diocesan seminary until 1888. The secondary school was relatively small, with around 225 boarders and 25 day boarders. Mungret was one of a number of Jesuit schools founded in Ireland. History =Pre-1882= In 1858 the Commissioners of Education had opened an agricultural college near the village of Mungret, from which Mungret College takes its name. This was largely due to the influence of Lord Monteagle of Brandon, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British Government and a good Irish landlord. It was built to accommodate seventy to eighty students but never had more than fourteen students and at times as few as four. In 1877 it was decided to close the college. It was rented by the Bishop of Limerick for his seminarians for the scholastic year of 1880‚Äì1881 and was then vacated. =Foundation= In 1850 a young priest of the Diocese of Dromore was received into the order of the Society of Jesus; his name was Fr. William Ronan. In 1872 he was appointed rector of the Sacred Heart Church and Crescent College, Limerick, a position he was to occupy for the next ten years. There he thought about the possibility of setting up a college to provide for unfulfilled vocations in Ireland.http://www.mungret.com/history-of-mungret-college/ He discovered that a fellow Jesuit in France, in 1865, had started a scheme for the endowment of special colleges in France and Belgium, called apostolic schools, which were supported by benefactors and by the parents of students. He travelled to the Continent to visit these colleges and to seek out an experienced man to take charge of a similar college in Limerick. While staying in a Jesuit house in France, he met Fr Jean Baptiste Ren√©, a jesuit priest and member of the community, an English speaker and to the great delight of Fr. Ronan, a former head of the apostolic school at Poitiers. He was also willing to come to Ireland if his Provincial would sanction his departure. With some difficulty this permission was obtained and Fr Ren√© was in Limerick for the opening of the apostolic school at Crescent House in September 1880. This had eight boys in its first year and by the end of the second year there were twenty eight. However overcrowding became an issue with the day pupils at Crescent and clearly a larger building was required. From 1888 until 1909 students were matriculated and examined for degrees by the Royal University of Ireland, subsequently with its dissolution and the establishment of the National University of Ireland, students were examined and had degrees awarded until 1912. =Mungret= Fr. Ronan had been considering the former agricultural college at Mungret as an alternative. However the apostolic school alone was not a viable proposition so he persuaded the Bishop of Limerick to send the diocesan seminary back to Mungret. The apostolics moved to Mungret on the 10th of August 1882, and were joined by the seminarians on September 14 of that year. Fr. Ronan was the first Rector and Fr Ren√© was in charge of the apostolics. The college began with 32 apostolics and 31 seminarians. Shortly after its founding a new Bishop of Limerick decided to house the seminarians in the city where they would be nearer the cathedral. This reduction in numbers was made up by accepting more lay boys. In the course of time the numbers of lay boys considerably exceeded the numbers of apostolics. At its height the College catered for 267 full-time and day boarders. =Closure= Mungret College closed in 1974. Many of its teaching staff transferred to Crescent College, another Jesuit school in Limerick, out of which Mungret College had originally grown. Dineen and Company purchased Mungret College and its of land in 1979 and subsequently purchased additional adjacent land.Limerick's Life, Mungret College The company has now closed down and it was dissolved on 12 February 2020.SoloCheck.ie, Dineen and Company Ltd., accessed 14 February 2020 Notable past pupils *The 1st Viscount Bracken, a journalist and businessman who served as a British Conservative Cabinet minister under Prime Minister Winston Churchill during World War II.

The instrument may be used to monitor ozone values for industrial applications or to determine the amount of ambient ozone at ground level and determine whether these values violate National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The ozone molecule absorbs ultraviolet radiation, and most ozone monitors utilized in regulatory applications use ultraviolet absorption to accurately quantify ozone levels. An ozone monitor of this type operates by pulling an air sample from the atmosphere into the machine with an air pump.http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/criteria/4-79-057.pdf During one cycle, the ozone monitor will take one air sample through the air inlet, and scrub the ozone from the air; for the next cycle, an air sample bypasses the scrubber and the ozone value calculated. The solenoid valve is electronically activated to shift the air flow either through the scrubber or to bypass it on a timed sequence. The difference between the two sampled values determines the actual ozone value at that time. The monitor may also have options to account for air pressure and air temperature to calculate the value of ozone. Image:ozoneairsampleflow.jpg The concentration of ozone is determined using the Beer-Lambert Law that basically says that the absorption of light is proportional to the concentration. For ozone, a 254 nanometer wavelength of light created by a mercury lamp is shined through a specific length of tubing with reflective mirrors. A photodiode at the other end of the tube detects the changes of brightness from the light. The onboard electronics process the values obtained and display the value on the screen and can also output an electrical signal in volts or a 4-20 mA current that can be read by an electronic data logger.

It was the location for the world's earliest known organised cricket match. The parish is located to the north west of Sevenoaks on the southern slopes of the North Downs. The parish is a small one, being in length and wide. It had a population of 3,092 at the 2011 Census. Apart from the village the remaining area is rural. Chevening House is located here. The Pilgrims' Way crosses the parish. Close to Chevening, the path of Harold Godwinson's army en route to the Battle of Hastings in 1066, heading south along what is now Chipstead Lane, crosses William the Conqueror's route after the battle towards London along the Pilgrim's Way. The village of Chevening is also small. It stands on the upper reaches of the River Darent. The village lies very close to the M25 motorway. Parish Church The parish church is dedicated to St Botolph. It is within the diocese of Rochester, and the deanery of Shoreham. The church has an albaster tomb to the lord of the manor, Sampson Lennard, and his wife Margaret, Lady Dacre. The church office, parish hall and rectory are located 1.3 miles distant from the parish church, on the outskirts of the village of Chipstead. The church is linked with Chevening (St Botolph's) Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School, which is located 1 mile from the church, also in the village of Chipstead. Cricket Chevening was the venue for the world's earliest known organised cricket match. The match can be deduced from a 1640 court case recording a \\"cricketing\\" of \\"Weald and Upland\\" against \\"Chalkhill\\" at Chevening \\"about thirty years since\\" (i.e. around 1611). The case concerned the land on which the game was played.Underdown, David (2000) Start of Play, p.4. London: Allen Lane. . Railway Chevening was served by a halt on the Westerham Valley Branch Line running between Westerham and Dunton Green: the branch opened in 1881 but the halt at Chevening was not added until 1906 when steam railmotor services began on the line.

Of noble Lithuanian extraction, Dobuzhinsky was born on August 14, 1875 in Novgorod into the family of an army officer. From 1885 to 1887, he attended the Drawing School of the Society for the Promotion of the Artists. Between 1895 and 1899, he read Law at the University of St. Petersburg, simultaneously studying in private studios. After graduating from the University, he was trained from 1899 to 1901 by Anton A≈æbe in Munich and Simon Holl√≥sy in Nagyb√°nya (Austria-Hungary). In Munich, he came to be influenced by the Jugendstil. On his return to Russia, he joined the Mir Iskusstva, an artistic circle which idealized the 18th century as the \\"age of elegance\\". Dobuzhinsky was distinguished from other miriskusniki by his expressionist manner and keen interest in modern industrial cityscapes. He often painted seedy or tragic scenes from urban life which expressed the nightmarish bleakness and loneliness of modern times. Among his works were also humorous vignettes and sketches with demon-like creatures which seemed to embody the monstrosities of urbanization. Like other members of the Mir iskusstva, Dobuzhinsky also experimented with scenic design. At first he worked for Constantin Stanislavski at the Moscow Arts Theatre, but later on also contributed sets to several Diaghilev productions. He was renowned as an excellent art teacher; among his young pupils was Vladimir Nabokov, with whom he maintained correspondence for decades. Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, A man with eyeglasses, or The portrait of Konstantin Sunnerberg, 1901-1902, The Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow. During the First World War Dobuzhinsky went with Eugene Lanceray to the front lines to sketch. In 1918, he supervised the theatrical workshop at the State Educational Workshops of the Decorative Arts (the former Stieglitz School of the Technical Drawing). In 1920, he took part in the Second Congress of the Communist International. In 1923-24, he went abroad to study developments in European art and to arrange one-man shows. In 1924, Dobuzhinsky followed the advice of Jurgis Baltrusaitis and withdrew to Lithuania. He was naturalized there in 1924 and lived in Kaunas until 1925. Between 1925 and 1929 lived in Paris where he designed sets for Nikita Balieff's The Bat. He returned to Lithuania in 1929. In Lithuania he worked at a state theatre as scenographer and created scenography for 38 plays, besides running a private painting school (1930‚Äì1933).He then emigrated to England in 1935, and moved to the United States in 1939 where he stayed for the duration of the war. He spent the last ten years of his life in Europe, occasionally returning to New York for theatrical work. He died in New York on November 20, 1957. His memoirs were published posthumously in Russian. Among his later works are series of masterful and dramatic illustrations, notably for Dostoyevsky's White Nights (1923) and Yuri Olesha's Three Fat Men (1925). Dobuzhinsky contributed sets for theatre productions in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, and D√ºsseldorf. During World War II, Dobuzhinsky painted imaginary landscapes of the besieged Leningrad.

Anderson to describe and model how a person integrates information from a number of sources in order to make an overall judgment. The theory proposes three functions. The valuation function V(S) is an empirically derived mapping of stimuli to an interval scale. It is unique up to an interval exchange transformation ( y = ax + b ). The integration function r = I{s_1,s_2, .., s_n} is an algebraic function combining the subjective values of the information. \\"Cognitive algebra\\" refers to the class of functions that are used to model the integration process. They may be adding, averaging, weighted averaging, multiplying, etc. The response production function R = M(r) is the process by which the internal impression is translated into an overt response. Information integration theory differs from other theories in that it is not erected on a consistency principle such as balance or congruity but rather relies on algebraic models. The theory is also referred to as functional measurement, because it can provide validated scale values of the stimuli. An elementary treatment of the theory, along with a Microsoft Windows program for carrying out functional measurement analysis, is provided in the textbook by David J. Weiss. Weiss, D. J. (2006). Analysis of variance and functional measurement: A practical guide. New York: Oxford University Press.  Integration models  There are three main types of algebraic models used in information integration theory: adding, averaging, and multiplying. Adding models R = reaction/overt behavior F/G = contributing factors R_1 = F_1 + G_1 (Condition 1) R_2 = F_2 + G_2 (Condition 2) Typically an experiment is designed so that: R_1=R_2, and F_1>F_2, so that G_1. There are two special cases known as discounting and augmentation. Discounting: The value of any Multiplicationfactor] is reduced if other factors that produce the same effect are added. Example: F_2 is not present or has a value of zero. If F_1 is positive, then G1 must be less than G_2. Augmentation: An inverse version of the typical model. Example: If F_1 is negative, then G_1 must be greater than G_2. Two advantages of adding models: # Participants are not required to have an exact intuitive calculation # The adding model itself need not be completely valid. Certain kinds of interaction among the factors would not affect the qualitative conclusions. Notes References *Anderson, N. H. Application of an Additive Model to Impression Formation.

London: Penguin, 2003. p.1406 Stapenhill was known for its brickyards in the 18th and 19th centuries. http://www.burton-on-trent.org.uk/category/surviving/stapenhill/stapenhill- general Several major music festivals take place every summer at Catton Hall, on the outskirts of the village. Summer bedding in Stapenhill GardensStapenhill from the South Stapenhill Gardens is the epitome of Stapenhill. Its main feature is a giant artificial swan with all flowers planted in it. This represents the swans who have historically inhabited the Gardens, and also the wider immutability of life in general. Similarly, the local football team is Stapenhill Swans. Stapenhill Gardens is also the location of the annual \\"Tulip Festival\\", an event unrivalled outside The Netherlands, although this has not run for several years. Current and former pubs and bars in the area include The Copper Hearth (now a Tesco supermarket), The New Inn, The Punch Bowl (now a care home), The Barley Mow (new home of the BIS), The Crown, The Grove, The Dart, The Freehold Tavern (now a Chinese restaurant), The Plough (now demolished for housing), and The Elms. Stapenhill is well known for its wide variety of shopping opportunities, ranging from major chain-stores to independent craft butchers. The primary retail centres are Main Street; Rosliston Road/Brackenwood Road area; and Short Street/Lincoln Road. Other local features include St Peter's Church of England church and a large cemetery. The main Secondary Schools in the area are Paulet High School and Blessed Robert Sutton Catholic Voluntary Academy. Primary schools include Violet Lane Infants and Edge Hill Junior to the east, and to the south Waterside Junior and Short Street Infants merged in 2011 to become Riverview Primary. The village is east of the Trent, and thus was administered as part of Derbyshire from at least 1086 until the Local Government Act 1888, when it passed into Staffordshire as a result of boundary changes. The boundaries of the original ancient village were Rosliston Road, Cumberland Road, Short Street and Norfolk Road.

Certified email is meant to provide a legal equivalent of the traditional registered mail: by paying a small fee, users are able to legally prove that a given email has been sent and received. Registered mail is mainly used in Italy,http://www.dirittodellinformatica.it/ict/pubblica- amministrazione/futuro-della-pec-armonizzazione-riconoscimento-europa.html but there are present efforts to extend its legal validity according to the framework of the European Union.http://www.progettocrescitadigitale.com/la- posta-elettronica-certificata-verso-le-regole-europee-giovanni-manca/  Description  A certified email can only be sent using a special Certified Email Account provided by a registered provider. When a certified email is sent, the sender's provider will release a receipt of the successful (or failed) transaction. This receipt has legal value and it includes precise information about the time the certified email was sent. Similarly, the receiver's provider will deliver the message in the appropriate certified email account and will then release to the sender a receipt of successful (or failed) delivery, indicating on this receipt the exact time of delivery. If either of these two receipts are lost by the sender, providers are required to issue a proof of transaction with equal legal validity, if this proof is requested within 30 months of delivery. In terms of user experience, a certified email account is very similar to a normal email account. The only additional features are the receipts, received as attachments, providing details and timestamps for all transactions. A certified email account can only handle certified email and can't be used to send regular email.  Technical Process  The development of this email service has conceptual variations that are dominated by two-party scenarios with only one sender and one receiver as well as a trusted third party (TTP) serving as a mediator. As in traditional registered mail, many certified email technologies call for the parties involved to trust the TTP, or the \\"postman\\", because it has the capacity to reveal the identity of the sender to the recipient once the protocol is initiated. There are, however, some applications based on multi- party email protocols; these include the technology originally proposed by Markowitch and Kremer, that involves an online or offline TTP in addition to the sender and receiver. There is also a multi-party version, wherein a user can send the same email to multiple recipients. In this system, those who acknowledge the receipt are able to view the data. Some applications also offer add-in features, such as the integration of the concept of timeliness, wherein a participant to the process can terminate a session in finite time in order to avoid waiting for a reply forever. The mediation of a trusted third party (TTP) requires both parties, the sender and the recipient, to come to terms in approving who will be the mediator. In compliance scenarios, where a regulation may simply require a party to deliver a notice to a given recipient and be able to prove having done so (i.e. GDPR), the role of a TTP can be trusted to an electronic registered delivery service capable to secure timestamped evidence of the contents and delivery of the electronic message, without the recipient's intervention.Carlos Tico (2012).

Certified Email in Italy  The Italian certified email (Posta elettronica certificata, PEC) was established in 2005 and it uses protocols described in the RFC 6109 (Request for Comments 6109), which was drafted in order to make the protocols public to the Internet community. Since July 1 of 2013, all communication between enterprises and the Italian public administration is required to be sent through PEC and paper documents are no longer accepted. All matters concerning PEC in Italy are supervised and regulated by a special government agency called AgID (\\"Agenzia per l'Italia digitale\\") which determines the authorized certified email providers, the legal framework of PEC and the rules and terms of use.

This species' common names vary between states; the name southern bell frog applies to New South Wales, growling grass frog in Victoria and South Australia, and green and gold frog in Tasmania. This species has been introduced to New Zealand. Description A light-green Litoria raniformis The growling grass frog is a very large, ground-dwelling tree frog up to 10 cm (almost 4 in) from snout to vent. It is a mottled bright green and bronze colour above, often with dark brown enameled bumps. It has a pale cream underside, with a faint cobbling pattern. A pale stripe runs from the side of the head down the flanks as a skin fold. The thighs are blue-green in colour. There are a series of shallow bumps over its back. This frog closely resembles the green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea), but is distinguished by the shallow bumps on its back, a shorter call, and a slightly different head and snout shape. The tympanum is visible in these frogs. The tadpoles are also very large (up to 9.5 cm or 3.7 in). The tadpoles often have a coppery pigment along their sides and an iridescent green sheen along their backbones. Ecology and behaviour This species is associated with large swamps, permanent dam impoundments, ponds, and lakes (particularly ones with reeds) in woodland, shrubland, open and coastal areas. This frog is an agile climber, but is most often found among dense reeds or along swampy grasslands. It hunts and basks in the sun during the day. Growling grass frogs reportedly hunt other frogs by zoning into the sound of their calls. The call is a three part moaning \\"craw-ork ar-ar\\", rising and then falling in tone (described as the sound of a duck or goose being strangled). The males develop black, rough nuptial pads on their thumbs during the breeding season, which occurs during spring although to late summer. Females have the ability to hiss when threatened. The eggs (up to several thousand) are distributed in a loose pile. These frogs stay in tadpole stage for at least one year. This frog is believed to be in decline across much of its range. In some regions, it has disappeared altogether, but in others it remains locally abundant (such as parts of northern Victoria and the Riverland in South Australia, associated with the Murray River). As a pet It is kept as a pet; in Australia, this animal may be kept in captivity with the appropriate permit.

The titles Seedy Saturday and Seedy Sunday are dedicated to the public domain by the event founder Sharon Rempel.submitted by Sharon Rempel, event founder, www.grassrootsolutions.com The first Seedy Saturday was held at VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver, Canada, in 1990. History The idea of conserving heritage varieties of garden and field crops was in its infancy in Canada in 1989. It was very difficult to find heritage varieties of vegetables, fruits, flowers and grains. In 1988 Sharon Rempel wanted to find period-appropriate heritage vegetables, flowers and wheat for the 1880s heritage gardens she was creating at the Keremeos Grist Mill museum. The Abundant Life Seed Foundation in Washington state was her sole source that added the date of the variety with the seed listing. Rempel organized the first Seedy Saturday event. It was held at VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver, Canada, in early 1990. In Canada, Seedy Saturdays and Seed Sundays continue to be locally or regionally organized events. Almost all of these events occur in the late winter, with a few in the autumn. In 2012 there were more than 100 events held in Canada.

History The Animal Welfare Board of India was established in 1962 under Section 4 of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,1960. Well-known humanitarian Rukmini Devi Arundale was instrumental in setting up the board and was its first chair. The Board consists of 28 Members, who serve for a period of 3 years. Its headquarters was in Chennai, which moved to Ballabhgarh of Faridabad district in Haryana state in early 2018. The Board was initially within the jurisdiction of the Government of India's Ministry of Food and Agriculture. In 1990, the subject of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was transferred to the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate change, where it now resides. =Lab animals= Concerned about the abuse of animals in research, in the Board's early history, it recommended that the government create the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). The Committee was created, and the Board's representative Dr. S. Chinny Krishna deposed twice before the Committee about \\"the dismal state of laboratories in India.\\" A number of years passed before the subject was \\"taken up effectively by the Government.\\" In 2001, the government passed Rules covering the breeding and experimentation on animals. =Animals in entertainment= Another early concern of the Board was the cruelty involved when animals were used in entertainment. In 1964, the Board published the booklet, \\"Circuses - Amusement for the Uncivilised\\". In 2001, the government passed the Performing Animals Rules, which were amended in 2005. In 2012, the Board reported that the Rules were being implemented in an effective way. Functions Some of the functions of the Board include: =Recognition of Animal Welfare Organisations= The Board oversees Animal Welfare Organisations (AWOs) by granting recognition to them if they meet its guidelines. The organisation must submit paperwork; agree to nominate a representative of the Animal Welfare Board of India on its Executive Committee; and to submit to regular inspections.

Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch, served as ports and trading centers in the Nanda, Maurya, Satavahana and Gupta empires as well as Western Kshatrapas period. After the fall of the Gupta empire in the 6th century, Gujarat flourished as an independent Hindu/Buddhist state. The Maitraka dynasty, descended from a Gupta general, ruled from the 6th to the 8th centuries from their capital at Vallabhi, although they were ruled briefly by Harsha during the 7th century. The Arab rulers of Sindh sacked Vallabhi in 770, bringing the Maitraka dynasty to an end. The Gurjara-Pratihara Empire ruled Gujarat after from the 8th to 10th centuries. As well as, for some periods the region came under the control of Rashtrakuta Empire and Pala Empire. In 775 the first Parsi (Zoroastrian) refugees arrived in Gujarat from Greater Iran. During the 10th century, the native Chaulukya dynasty came to power. From 1297 to 1300, Alauddin Khalji, the Turkic Sultan of Delhi, destroyed Anhilwara and incorporated Gujarat into the Delhi Sultanate. After Timur's sacking of Delhi at the end of the 14th century weakened the Sultanate, Gujarat's governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar asserted his independence, and his son, Sultan Ahmad Shah I (ruled 1411 to 1442), restructured Ahmedabad as the capital. In the early 16th century the Rana Sanga invasion of Gujarat weakened the power of Gujarat as he annexed northern Gujarat and appointed his vassal to rule there, however after his death, the Sultan of Gujarat recovered its kingdom and even sacked Chittor Fort in 1535. The Sultanate of Gujarat remained independent until 1576, when the Mughal emperor Akbar conquered it and annexed it to the Mughal Empire as a province. Surat had become the prominent and main port of India during Mughal rule. Later in the 18th century, Gujarat came under control of the Maratha Empire who dominated the politics of India. The British East India Company wrested control of much of Gujarat from the Marathas during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. Many local rulers, notably the Gaekwads of Baroda, made a separate peace with the British and acknowledged British sovereignty in return for retaining local self-rule. Gujarat was placed under the political authority of the Bombay Presidency, with the exception of Baroda state, which had a direct relationship with the Governor-General of India. From 1818 to 1947, most of present-day Gujarat, including Kathiawar, Kutch, and northern and eastern Gujarat were divided into hundreds of princely states, but several districts in central and southern Gujarat were ruled directly by British officials. Mohandas Gandhi, considered India's \\"father of the nation\\", was a Gujarati who led the Indian Independence Movement against the British colonial rule. Gujarat was formed by splitting Bombay state in 1960 on linguistic lines. From 1960 to 1995, Indian National Congress retained power in Gujarat Legislative Assembly while other political parties ruled for incomplete terms in the 1970s and 1990. Bharatiya Janata Party has been in the power since 1998. Stone Age (before 4000 BCE) The cultural history of Gujarat begins from the Middle Pleistocene. The lands of Gujarat has been continuously inhabited from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 200,000 BP) period. Several sites of stone age are discovered in riverbeds of Sabarmati, Mahi river and lower Narmada rivers of Gujarat. The Middle Paleolithic sites are found from Kutch, Jamnagar, Panchmahals, Hiran valley in Saurashtra and Vapi and Lavacha of Valsad district. The Upper Paleolithic period sites from Visadi, Panchmahals, Bhamaria, Kantali, Palanpur and Vavri are also explored. The Middle (c.45,000‚Äì25,000 BP) and Late Palaeolithic artifacts include hand-axes, cleavers, chopping tools, borers, points, and scrapers. The sites in Kutch and Bhadar riverbeds in Saurashtra has also yielded stone age tools. Bhandarpur near Orsang valley is rich in Palaeolithic tools. Some of other such sites are Hirpura, Derol, Kapadvanj, Langhnaj and Shamlaji. More than 700 sites are located in Gujarat which indicate Mesolithic/Microlithic using communities dated to 7000 BC to 2000 BCE divided in Pre-Chalcolithic and Chalcolithic period. Some Mesolithic sites include Langhnaj, Kanewal, Tarsang, Dhansura, Loteshwar, Santhli, Datrana, Moti Pipli and Ambakut. The people of the Mesolithic period were nomadic hunter-gathers with some managing the herds of sheep-goat and cattle. Neolithic tools are found at Langhnaj in north Gujarat. Chalcolithic to Bronze Age (4000 BC‚Äì1300 BCE) An ancient well at Lothal, and the city drainage canals. Total 755 chalcolithic settlements are discovered in Gujarat belonging to various traditions and cultures which ranged from 3700 BCE to 900 BCE. Total 59 of these sites are excavated while others are studied from artifacts. These traditions are closely associated with Harappan civillization and difference between them is identified by difference in ceramics and findings of microliths. These traditions and cultures include Anarta Tradition (c. 3950‚Äì1900 BC), Padri Ware (3600‚Äì2000 BC), Pre-Prabhas Assemblage (3200‚Äì2600 BC), Pre Urban Harappan Sindh Type Pottery (Burial Pottery) (3000‚Äì2600 BC), Black and Red Ware (3950‚Äì900 BC), Reserved Slip Ware (3950‚Äì1900 BC), Micaceous Red Ware (2600‚Äì1600 BC). Prabhas Assemblage (2200‚Äì1700 BC) and Lustrous Red Ware (1900‚Äì1300 BC) are some late material cultures. The few sites associated with Malwa Ware and Jorwe Ware are also found. Gujarat has large number of the archaeological sites associated with Indus Valley Civilization. Total 561 Classical Harappan (2600‚Äì1900 BC) and Sorath Harappan (2600‚Äì1700 BC) sites are reported in Gujarat. The sites in Kutch, namely, Surkotada, Desalpur, Pabumath and Dholavira are some major sites of Urban period. The sites of the post- Urban period include Lothal B, Rangpur IIC and III, Rojdi C, Kuntasi, Vagad I B, Surkotada 1C, Dholavira VI &VII.; Iron Age (1500‚Äì200 BCE) At several sites the post-Harappan culture continued. Pastoralism was also widespread and served as trade-links between sites. These cultures are associated with rise of Mahajanapadas. There is an insufficient archeological data for transition to the Early Historic period. This Vedic period is referenced with Vedic and Puranic sources. According to both legends and tradition, the Yadavas under Krishna inhabited of the Saurashtra peninsula of Gujarat before it came under the Mauryas. But there is no archaeological and historical evidence to prove this. There are some evidences of occupation prior to 400 BC from Dwarka, Nagara and Prabhas Patan. Bharuch was the major port town of Iron Age. =Early Historic= The Early Historic material culture of Gujarat include the presence of Northern Black Polished Ware, continued dominance of Black- and-Red Ware, slow introduction and later domination of Red Polished Ware, occurrence of Roman Amphorae, Rang Mahal Ware (100‚Äì300), introduction of glass and lead, followed by gradual conquest of Iron, an agriculture-based economy, shell industry, development of script, rise of the urban settlements, brick structural remains, monumental buildings, international trade and development of Jainism, Buddhism, and Vaishnavism. The excavated sites of the Early Historic period include Dhatva, Jokha, Kamrej, Karvan, Bharuch, Nagal, Timbarva, Akota from South Gujarat; Nagara from central Gujarat; Vadnagar, Shamlaji, Devnimori from north Gujarat and Amreli, Vallabhi, Prabhas Patan, Padri and Dwarka from Saurashtra.

Crowned Sasanian-style bust right / Fire altar with ribbons and attendants; star and crescent flanking flames.CNG Coins Chandragupta Maurya of Maurya dynasty conquered a number of earlier states of Gujarat circa 300 BC. Pushyagupta, a Vaishya, was appointed Governor of Saurashtra by the Mauryan regime. He ruled (322 BC to 294 BC) Girinagar (present Junagadh) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his famous edicts on the rock at Junagadh, but asked his Governor Tusherpha to take out canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan Governor had built a dam. Between the decline of the Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of Samprati Mauryas of Ujjain, there was a Greek incursion into Gujarat led by Demetrius. In the first half of the first century A.D. there is the story of a merchant of King Gondaphares landing in Gujarat with Apostle Thomas. The incident of the cup-bearer killed by a lion might indicate that the port city described is in Gujarat.The Acts of Judas Thomas, M.R.James,Tr.by M. R. James, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924.A.E. MEDLYCOTT: AND THE APOSTLE THOMAS Indo- scythians For nearly 300 years from the start of the 1st century AD, Saka rulers played a prominent part in Gujarat's history. Weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the Ruler Rudradaman I (100 AD) of the Saka satraps known as Western Satraps, or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat several battles were fought between the south Indian Satavahana dynasty and the Western Satraps. The greatest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century CETrade And Trade Routes in Ancient India von Moti Chandra page: 99  Middle Kingdoms (230 BCE ‚Äì 1206 CE)  =Guptas and Maitrakas= The Kshatrapa dynasty was replaced by the Gupta reign with the conquest of Gujarat by Chandragupta Vikramaditya. Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta has left an inscription (450 AD) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the repairs of the embankment, damaged by floods, of Sudarshan lake by his Governor. Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both part of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century the Gupta empire started to decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the Maitraka general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 AD he set up what came to be known as the Maitraka state. He shifted his capital from Girinagar to Valabhipur, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast. Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful and their rule prevailed over large parts of Gujarat and even over adjoining Malwa. Maitrakas set up a university which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the famous Nalanda university. It was during the rule of Dhruvasena Maitrak that Chinese philosopher-traveler Xuanzang visited in 640 AD. = Gurjara-Pratihara Empire = Rani ki Vav (The Queen's stepwell) at Patan was built in the 11th century.alt=left In the early 8th century some parts of Gujarat was ruled by the south Indian Chalukya dynasty. In the early 8th century the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate established an Empire which stretched from Spain in the west to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east. The Arab rulers tried to expand their Empire in the 8th century and invaded Gujarat but the Arab invaders were defeated by the Chalukya general Pulakeshin. After this victory the Arab invaders were driven out of Gujarat. Pulakeshin received the title Avanijanashraya (refuge of the people of the earth) by Vikramaditya II for the protection of Gujarat. In the late 8th century the Kannauj Triangle period started. The 3 major Indian dynasties the northwest Indian Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, the south Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty and the east Indian Pala Empire dominated India from the 8th to 10th century. During this period the northern part of Gujarat was ruled by the north Indian Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty and the southern part of Gujarat was ruled by the south Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty.Ancient India by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar p. 366 Southern Gujarat was ruled by the south Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty until it was captured by the south Indian ruler Tailapa II of the Western Chalukya Empire.History, Religion and Culture of India, by S. Gajrani p.32 = Chaulukya Kingdom = Taranga Jain Temple constructed by Kumarapala (1143 ‚Äì 1172 CE) The Chaulukya dynastyThe Chaulukya dynasty is not to be confused with the Chalukya dynasty. ruled Gujarat from c. 960 to 1243. Gujarat was a major center of Indian Ocean trade, and their capital at Anhilwara (Patan) was one of the largest cities in India, with population estimated at 100,000 in the year 1000. In 1026, the famous Somnath temple in Gujarat was destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni. After 1243, the Chaulukyas lost control of Gujarat to their feudatories, of whom the Vaghela chiefs of Dholka came to dominate Gujarat. In 1292 the Vaghelas became tributaries of the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri in the Deccan. Karna of the Vaghela dynasty was the last Hindu ruler of Gujarat. He was defeated and overthrown by the superior forces of Alauddin Khalji from Delhi in 1297. With his defeat Gujarat not only became part of the Muslim empire but the Rajput hold over Gujarat lost forever.  Late Medieval period (1206‚Äì1526 CE)  =Delhi Sultanate (1298‚Äì1407 CE)= Before 1300, Muslims had little presence in Gujarat. The occasional was mainly either as sea-farers or traders coming from Arabian Sea. They were allowed to establish two small settlements in Cambay (now Khambhat) and Bharuch. Gujarat finally fell under Delhi Sultanate following repeated expeditions under Alauddin Khalji around the end of the 13th century. He ended the rule of Vaghela dynasty under Karna II and established Muslim rule in Gujarat. Soon the Tughluq dynasty came to power in Delhi whose emperor carried out expeditions to quell rebellion in Gujarat and established their firm control over the region by the end of the 14th century. =Gujarat Sultanate (1407‚Äì1535 CE)= Jama Masjid, Ahmedabad. Following Timur's invasion of Delhi, the Delhi Sultanate weakened considerably so the last Tughluq governor Zafar Khan declared himself independent in 1407 and formally established Gujarat Sultanate. The next sultan, his grandson Ahmad Shah I founded the new capital Ahmedabad in 1411. The prosperity of the sultanate reached its zenith during the rule of Mahmud Begada. He subdued most of the Rajput chieftains and built navy off the coast of Diu. In 1509, the Portuguese wrested Diu from Gujarat sultanate following the Battle of Diu (1509). In 1520 Rana Sanga of Mewar invaded Gujarat with his Powerful Rajput confederacy of 52,000 Rajputs supported by his three vassals.Rao Ganga Rathore of Marwar too joined him with Garrison of 8,000 Rajputs,other allies of Rana were Rawal Udai singh of Vagad and Rao Viram deva of Merta.He defeated the Muslim army of Nizam khan and chased them upto Ahmedabad.Sanga call of his invasion 20 miles before of capital Ahemdabad.He plunder down the royal treasuries of Gujarat and destroy several mosques and built temples over them. Sanga successfully annexed Northern Gujarat and appoint one of his vassals to rule there. Mughal emperor Humayun attacked Gujarat in 1535 and thereafter Bahadur Shah was killed by the Portuguese while making a deal in 1537. The decline of the Sultanate started with the assassination of Sikandar Shah in 1526. The end of the sultanate came in 1573, when Akbar annexed Gujarat in his empire. The last ruler Muzaffar Shah III was taken prisoner to Agra. In 1583, he escaped from the prison and with the help of the nobles succeeded to regain the throne for a short period before being defeated by Akbar's general Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana. Early modern period (1526‚Äì1858 CE) =Mughal Empire (1535‚Äì1756)= Flight of Sultan Bahadur during Humayun's campaign in Gujarat, 1535. Folio from an Akbarnama (History of Akbar), c. 1590. Under Akbar the Great (1542‚Äì1605), Gujarat became the province (subah) of the Mughal Empire governed by the viceroys and officers appointed by the Mughal emperors from Delhi. Akbar's foster brother Mirza Aziz Kokaltash was appointed as the viceroy who strengthened Mughal hold over the region. The nobles of former Sultanate continued to resist and rebel during the reign of the next emperor Jahangir (1605‚Äì1627) but Kokaltash and his successor viceroys subdued them. Jahangir also permitted the British East India Company to establish factories in Surat and elsewhere in Gujarat. The next emperor Shah Jahan (1627‚Äì1658) expanded his territories in south and his viceroys made hold over Kathiawar peninsula including Nawanagar. Shah Jahan had also appointed his prince Aurangzeb, who was involved in religious disputes, prince Dara Shikoh and later prince Murad Bakhsh as viceroys. Following battle of succession, Aurangzeb (1658‚Äì1707) came to the Mughal throne and his policies resulted in revolts and discontent. His prince Muhammad Azam Shah also served as a viceroy. During the next three emperors (1707‚Äì1719) who had brief reigns, the nobles became more and more powerful due to instability in the Delhi. The royals of Marwar were appointed viceroys frequently. During the reign of the emperor Muhammad Shah (1719‚Äì1748), the struggle between the Mughal and Maratha nobles were heightened with frequent battles and incursions. The south Gujarat was lost to the Marathas and the towns in north and central Gujarat was attacked on several occasions with frequent demand of tributes. The Marathas continued to grow their hold and the frequent change of viceroys did not reverse the trend. The competing houses of Marathas, Gaikwars and Peshwas engaged between themselves which slow down their progress for a while. They later made peace between themselves. During the reign of the next emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur (1748‚Äì1754), there was nominal control over the nobles who acted on their own. There were frequent fights between themselves and with Marathas. Ahmedabad, the capital of province, fell to the Marathas in 1752. It was regained by noble Momin Khan for a short time but again lost to the Marathas in 1756 after a long siege. Finding opportunity, the British captured Surat in 1759. After a setback at Panipat in 1761, the Marathas strengthened their hold on Gujarat. During this fifty years, the power struggle between the Mughal nobles and Marathas caused disorder and the decline in prosperity. =Maratha Empire (1718‚Äì1819)= When the cracks had started to develop in the edifice of the Mughal empire in the mid-17th century, the Marathas were consolidating their power in the west, Chatrapati Shivaji, the great Maratha ruler, attacked Surat twice first in 1664 and again in 1672. These attacks marked the entry of the Marathas into Gujarat. However, before the Maratha inroads into Gujarat, the Europeans had made their presence felt, with the Portuguese leading them, followed by the Dutch and the English. The Peshwas had established their sovereignty over Gujarat including Saurashtra, and collected taxes and tributes through their representatives. Damaji Gaekwad and Kadam Bande divided the Peshwa's territory between them, with Damaji establishing the sway of Gaekwad over Gujarat and made Baroda (present-day Vadodara) his capital. The ensuing internecine war among the Marathas were fully exploited by the British, who interfered in the affairs of both Gaekwads and the Peshwas. The British also embarked upon their policy of Subsidiary Alliance. With this policy they established their paramountcy over one princely state after another. Anandrao Gaekwad joined the Alliance in 1802 and surrendered Surat and adjoining territories to the British. In the garb of helping the Marathas, the British helped themselves, and gradually the Marathas' power came to an end, in 1819 in Gujarat. Gaekwad and other big and small rulers accepted the British Paramountcy. Colonial period (1819‚Äì1947 CE) Map of Gujarat, 1866 Princely states of Gujarat in 1924 In the 1600s, the Dutch, French, English and Portuguese all established bases along the western coast of the region. Portugal was the first European power to arrive in Gujarat, and after the Battle of Diu and Treaty of Bassein, acquired several enclaves along the Gujarati coast, including Daman and Diu as well as Dadra and Nagar Haveli. These enclaves were administered by Portuguese India under a single union territory for over 450 years, only to be later incorporated into the Republic of India on 19 December 1961 by military conquest. The British East India Company established a factory in Surat in 1614 following the commercial treaty made with Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim Jahangir, which formed their first base in India, but it was eclipsed by Bombay after the English received it from Portugal in 1668 as part of the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal. The state was an early point of contact with the west, and the first British commercial outpost in India was in Gujarat.WINGS Birding Tours to India: the West ‚Äì Gujarat and the Rann of Kutch ‚Äì Itinerary .

Most notably, from 1705 to 1716, Senapati Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Pilaji Gaekwad, first ruler of Gaekwad dynasty, established the control over Baroda and other parts of Gujarat. Laxmi Vilas Palace, completed in 1890 is one of the largest palaces in India.

In 1956, Bombay state was enlarged to include Kutch, Saurashtra, and parts of Hyderabad state and Madhya Pradesh in central India. The new state had a mostly Gujarati-speaking north and a Marathi-speaking south. Mahagujarat Movement led by Indulal Yagnik demanded splitting of Bombay state on linguistic lines. On 1 May 1960, Bombay state bifurcated into Gujarat and Maharashtra. The capital of Gujarat was Ahmedabad. Kutch was hit by the earthquake in 1956 which destroyed major parts of Anjar town. Gandhidham, Sardarnagar and Kubernagar were refugee settlements established for the resettlement of Sindhi Hindu refugees arriving from Pakistan after partition. =1960‚Äì1973= left Members of legislative assembly were elected from 132 constituencies of newly formed Gujarat state. Indian National Congress (INC) won the majority and Jivraj Narayan Mehta became the first chief minister of Gujarat. He served until 1963. Balwantrai Mehta succeed him. During Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Mehta flew on aircraft to inspect Kutch border between India and Pakistan. The aircraft was shot down by Pakistan Air Force. Mehta was killed in the crash. Hitendra Kanaiyalal Desai succeeded him and won assembly elections. In 1969, Indian National Congress split into Congress (O) headed by Morarji Desai and Congress (I) headed by Indira Gandhi. At the same time, the Hindu nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) had established itself deeply in Gujarat around this period. The riots broke out across Gujarat in September to October 1969, resulting in large number of casualties and damage to properties. Desai resigned in 1971 due to split of INC and President's rule was imposed in Gujarat. Later Ghanshyam Oza became chief minister when Indira Gandhi led Congress (I) won majority in parliament after 1971 Indo-Pakistani war. Chimanbhai Patel opposed Oza and became chief minister in 1972. The capital of Gujarat moved from Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar in 1971 but legislative assembly building was completed in 1982. =1974‚Äì2000= Navnirman movement started in December 1973 due to price rise and corruption in public life. People demanded resignation of Patel. Due to pressure of protests, Indira Gandhi asked Patel to step down. He resigned on 9 February 1974 and President's rule imposed. The governor suspended the state assembly and President's rule was imposed. Opposition parties led stepped in with demand for dissolution of state assembly.Congress had 140 out of 167 MLAs in state assembly. 15 Congress (O) and three Jan Sangh MLAs also resigned. By March, protesters had got 95 of 167 to resign. Morarji Desai, leader of Congress (O), went on an indefinite fast in March and the assembly was dissolved bringing end to agitation. No fresh election held until Morarji Desai went on indefinite hunger strike in April 1975. The fresh elections were held in June 1975. Chimanbhai Patel formed new party named Kisan Mazdoor Lok Paksh and contested on his own. Congress lost elections which won only 75 seats. Coalition of Congress (O), Jan Sangh, PSP and Lok Dal known as Janata Morcha won 88 seats and Babubhai J. Patel became Chief Minister. Indira Gandhi imposed the emergency in 1975. Janata Morcha government lasted nine months and president's rule imposed in March 1976 following failure of passage of budget in assembly to opposition of coalition partners. Later Congress won elections in December 1976 and Madhav Singh Solanki became Chief Minister. A year later Madhav Singh Solanki resigned and again Babubhai Patel led Janata Party formed the government. He shifted his cabinet to Morbi for six months during 1979 Machchhu dam failure disaster which resulted in large casualties. Janata Morcha government was dismissed and president's rule was imposed in 1980 even though it had majority. Later Madhav Singh Solanki led INC won the election in 1980 and formed the government which completed five years in office. Amarsinh Chaudhary succeeded him in 1985 and headed government till 1989. Solanki again became chief minister until INC lost in 1990 election following Mandal commission protests. Chimanbhai Patel came back to power in March 1990 as the head of a Janata Dal -Bharatiya Janata Party coalition government. Coalition broke just few months after in October 1990 but Chimanbhai Patel managed to retain majority with support of 34 INC legislatures. Later Patel joined the INC and continued till his death in February 1994. Chhabildas Mehta succeeded him and continued till March 1995. In 1994 plague endemic broke out in Surat resulting in 52 deaths. Following the rise of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at centre, Keshubhai Patel led BJP won in 1995 assembly election. Keshubhai Patel became the chief minister of Gujarat in March but resigned eight months later as his colleague Shankersinh Vaghela revolted against him. BJP was split as Rashtriya Janata Party was formed by Vaghela who became the Chief Minister by support of INC. Assembly was dissolved in 1998 as INC withdrew its support. BJP returned to power led by Patel in 1998 assembly elections and he became the chief minister again. In 1998, a severe tropical cyclone hit Kandla port and Saurashtra and Kutch regions. =2000‚Äìpresent= Aftershocks, 2001 Gujarat earthquake ‚Äì yellow star marks epicenter Gujarat was hit with a devastating earthquake on 26 January 2001 which claimed a staggering 20,000 lives, injured another 200,000 people and severely affected the lives of 40 million of the population.

Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration; as well as a loss of BJP seats in by-elections and mismanagement of relief works during the aftermath of the 2001 Bhuj earthquake; prompted the BJP's national leadership to seek a new candidate for the office of chief minister. He was replaced by Narendra Modi. The skyline of Ahmedabad filled with smoke as buildings are set on fire by rioting mobs during the Gujarat Riots of 2002. The riots led to at least 1,044 dead, 223 missing, and 2,500 injured. The Gujarat Riots of 2002, was a three-day period of inter-communal violence in Gujarat between the Hindus and Muslims, characterized by mass murder, loot, rape, and destruction of property, affecting thousands of people, mostly Muslims. Though officially classified as a communalist riot, the events of 2002 have been described as a pogrom by many scholars. Scholars studying the 2002 riots state that they were premeditated and constituted a form of ethnic cleansing, and that the state government and law enforcement were complicit in the violence that occurred. However, Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Supreme Court of India, rejected claims that the state government had not done enough to prevent the riots. In September 2002, there was a terrorist attack on Akshardham temple complex at Gandhinagar. Modi led BJP won December 2002 election with majority. In 2005 and 2006, Gujarat was affected by floods. In July 2008, a series of 21 bomb blasts hit Ahmedabad, within a span of 70 minutes. 56 people were killed and over 200 people were injured in the attack. 2009 Gujarat hepatitis outbreak resulted in 49 deaths.

Heavy rain in June and July 2015 resulted in widespread flooding in Saurashtra and north Gujarat resulting in more than 150 deaths. The wild life of Gir Forest National Park and adjoining area was also affected. Starting July 2015, the people of Patidar community carried out demonstrations across the state seeking Other Backward Class status which turned violent on 25 August and 19 September 2015 for brief period. The agitation continued and again turned violent in April 2016. In late 2016, Dalits protested across Gujarat in response to an assault on Dalit men in Una. Following heavy rain in July 2017, the state, especially north Gujarat, was affected by the severe flood resulting in more than 200 deaths. In October 2018, a rape incident had triggered the attacks on the Hindi-speaking migrants in Gujarat leading to exodus. In 2019, Vadodara was flooded while there was a fire in a commercial complex at Surat causing death of 22 children.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The home is open to visitors from April to October. History =General= The Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home was constructed in Dixon, Illinois, in 1891; its design is fairly typical of American houses during the time period. The house's original owners were William C. and Susan Thompson; it was eventually sold, in 1917. The home's most significant period was between 1920 and 1923 and between 1975 and 1977 when it changed hands twice. In August 1980 a group of local residents, led by Lynn Knights of Dixon, Illinois, purchased the home. The group was then known as the Reagan Home Preservation and Restoration Committee.Redebaugh, Caroline. \\"Ronald Reagan's Boyhood Home\\", National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form, April 24, 1981, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, accessed January 22, 2009. =National Historic Site designation= The home is open to the public and operated by the Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home Foundation. On February 6, 2002, (Public Law 107-137), the United States Secretary of the Interior was authorized to purchase the property from the foundation and establish a U.S. National Historic SiteNot to be confused with the home's 1982 listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service (NPS).\\"Public Law 137-107\\", February 6, 2002, 107th United States Congress, accessed January 20, 2009.\\"Reagan turns 91\\", CBS News, February 6, 2002, accessed January 23, 2009. The law specifies that the site will not be designated as the Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home National Historic Site until after the Department of the Interior acquires the property. The foundation made a point of pride in receiving no funding from the state or federal government, in keeping with Reagan's motto that \\"government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem.\\" But as Reagan and his presidency receded from memory, visits dwindled to 5,000 per year by 2019, and the house increasingly fell into disrepair. In 2018, the foundation's perilous finances forced it to offer to sell the home to the National Park Service, which manages 16 other presidential homes.

Historic significance =National Register significance= The Reagan Boyhood Home is most significant as the home of 40th U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his family from late 1920 until 1923. Reagan was nine years old at the time and in grade school. Though the family moved from the house they remained in Dixon throughout the former president's formative years.

While they lived in the home the Reagan brothers shared a second-floor bedroom, despite the house having three bedrooms. Ronald's mother used the third as a work room. The lone outbuilding on the property was used by the brothers for such activities as raising rabbits.

There are currently three operational Radio Battalions in the Marine Corps organization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. In fleet operations, teams from Radio Battalions are most often attached to the command element of Marine Expeditionary Units. Concept A Radio Battalion consists mainly of signals intelligence and electronic intelligence operators organized into smaller tactical units with different roles. Basic collection teams consist of 4‚Äì6 operators using specialized equipment based in HMMWVs. A variation on this is the MEWSS (Mobile Electronic Warfare Support System), which is an amphibious light armored vehicle equipped with similar electronic warfare equipment. MEWSS crews serve dual roles as electronic warfare operators and LAV crewmen. Radio Reconnaissance Platoons serve in a special operations role where the use of standard collection teams is not possible, such as covert infiltrations or tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel (TRAP). History In June 1943, 2nd Radio Intelligence Platoon was activated at Camp Elliott, California. The unit took part in the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Peleliu. The 3rd Radio Intelligence Platoon was also formed in June 1943 and took part in the Battles of the Kwajalein Atoll and Okinawa. From World War II until the early 1960s, various units performed radio intercepts, growing from platoon to company and, in 1964, to 1st Radio Battalion. Sub-units of the battalion were deployed to Vietnam from 1965 to 1975, including participation in evacuation efforts during the Fall of Saigon. In the early 1980s, 2nd Radio Battalion was part of the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut, Lebanon. More recently, Radio Battalions served in Operation Desert Storm, Somalia, Kosovo, the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, and the 2004 Operation Phantom Fury in Fallujah. Radio Battalions also send detachments to augment intelligence efforts at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, and at other bases throughout the world. In Afghanistan, Radio Battalion has proven especially effective against improvised explosive devices.Nygaard, Bryan. \\"Radio Battalion Helps ANGLICO Intercept Insurgents.\\" US Marine Corps News, 6 June 2011.

The (C) symbol shows that the Bren carrier is a reinforcement unit. A set up of \\"Richard III\\", a block wargame A counter is usually a small cardboard square moved around on the map of a board wargame to represent relevant information or determine certain things. The first wargame based on cardboard counters was War Tactics or Can Great Britain Be Invaded? invented by Arthur Renals of Leicester in 1911.Christopher Lewin, War Games and their History, Chapter 8, Fonthill Media, Stroud (GB) 2012, The first wargame bringing counters to a mass-market was Tactics, invented by Charles S. Roberts in 1952. Traditional wargames typically have hundreds of counters (The Russian Campaign, 225; GI: Anvil of Victory, 856; Terrible Swift Sword, >2,000). Squad Leader had counters of different sizes: 520 -inch counters and 192 -inch, with the different sizes used for different purposes. Boardgame counters are often closely related to military map marking symbols, such as those seen in the NATO standard APP-6a, and often include a simplified APP-6a representation as part of the counter. Types *Representational counters, usually called \\"unit\\" counters, directly represent a unit, individual, vehicle, or weapon. *Informational counters don't represent a specific type of character, unit, or weapon, but describe a state such as destroyed, immobilized, out of ammunition, captured, etc. These are sometimes called \\"markers\\", or \\"system counters\\" (for example, a counter used on a turn record track) as they aid in managing systemic elements of the game such as length. *Chits are not directly representational or informational, but are used to determine things such as turn order. Variations In microgames, counters were printed on one or more sheets of thick paper which the player had to cut for themselves rather than the die-cut cardboard sheets included with most board wargames. Dragon Magazine used to include counters printed on a cardstock centerfold for monthly games (especially by Tom Wham). In block wargames, wooden blocks are used instead of cardboard as the counters to represent pieces, in order to emulate the fog of war (by placing the blocks upright to make the information visible to only one of the players). Often, when units take damage, the counter is rotated to signify the units new attack strength. Although counters are typically square, some games use oblong rectangles as counters for individual ships, as in Flying Colors, or for land units in tactical-scale games when the designer wishes to emphasize the facing or linearity of the unit, as in the Great Battles of History series. Other variations are of course possible. The unit counters in Luftwaffe are circular, while one game covering the Eastern Front in World War II had hexagonal counters.

It is located in the municipality of ƒåukarica. Completed by 1988, in January 2019 it became the first modern neighborhood of Belgrade which was declared a cultural monument. It is registered at the Docomomo International and is represented at the permanent exhibition in the New York's Museum of Modern Art.  Location  Cerak Vinogradi is bordered by the neighborhoods of Cerak and Filmski Grad to the north, Rakovica and Skojevsko Naselje to the east, Vidikovac to the south and Ibar Highway to the west. Across the highway are the southern sub-neighborhoods of ≈Ωarkovo, Bele Vode and Rupƒçine. It is divided in two sections, Cerak I and Cerak II. \\"Pilota Mihajla Petroviƒáa\\" Street, which divides Cerak Vinogradi and Vidikovac is also a municipality border between ƒåukarica and Rakovica.  History  Initial archeological work discovered a previous settlement at the site, dated to Lower Paleolithic period and Vinƒça culture. The area of the present neighborhood was designed in the last years of the 1970s, and is a prime example of late Modern architectural style. The construction began in 1979 and the arrangement of the neighborhood was fully finished in 1988. Once considered one of the most modern and beautiful boroughs of Belgrade, in the 1990s, together with the deteriorating socio-economic conditions of the country, Cerak Vinogradi saw the effect of low maintenance, degradation of the environment, etc. The settlement was planned for 15,000 inhabitants. There are objects which were part of the project, but were not built: public swimming pool, sports arena, multifunctional center at the corner of the Jablaniƒçka Street and the Ibar Highway, etc. One of the neighborhood's architects, Milenija Maru≈°iƒá, stated in 2019 that she will continue to insists that everything is built, as per project.  Characteristics  A green space area in Cerak Vinogradi. One of the street corners in Cerak Vinogradi The borough is residential, with neighborhood type commercial content, and extensive parks and green spaces, with a population of 12,642 in 1991 and 13,091 in 2002. Administratively a local community, sub-municipal administrative units since the 1980s, it merged with the neighboring Cerak and Sportski Centar local communities prior to the 2011 census. United Cerak local community had a population of 43,993. As of June 2015 it has three large supermarkets, a medical center, an elementary school and three large kindergartens. All streets are named after a species of the tree lining the whole length (Ash Street, Linden Street, Cedar Street, etc.). The building type is apartment block, usually paired in a line of G+3 and G+6 floors high. There‚Äôs only light traffic (access roads) inside the neighborhood. The nearby area is residential with developing commercial sector since the 1990s. A shopping mall with a McDonald's restaurant is in the immediate vicinity, with a farmers' market and a number of other stores nearby. The name itself describes a previous state of the area (Cerak is Serbian for turkey oak forest and Vinogradi is for vineyards). The neighborhood (including Cerak I and Cerak II, finished in 1987) spreads over an area of and has 3,650 residential units in 67 buildings.  Assessment  The neighborhood features in the New York's Museum of Modern Art 2018 exhibition exploring the architecture of the former Yugoslavia, Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948‚Äì1980. The museum researchers preparing the exhibition, stated that Cerak Vinogradi is the only modern neighborhood in former Yugoslavia that hasn't ben ruined by additional construction on the green areas and that ambient unit hasn't been devastated. Due to architectural-urbanistic value, the area was originally under the regime of \\"full protection\\", meaning complete preservation of the area, with no changes (possible use changes inside particular objects, with preservation of the authenticity and architectural values of the object) - Criteria K2, K8, K6. On 18 January 2019, Cerak Vinogradi was placed under the state protection and declared a cultural monument, as the first modern neighborhood in Belgrade to be protected. After the Concrete Utopia exhibition was finished, together with New Belgrade's Block 23, Cerak Vinogradi remained represented at museum's permanent collection. After previous bad experience with Blocks 61, 62 and 63, where they had to work under the dictate of the urbanists, here the Maru≈°iƒás worked together with the chief urbanist in the project, Dragutin Kadoviƒá. They followed the rules set by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the 1st century: architecture depends on order, layout, euryhtmics, symmetry and economy. The resulting architecture of Cerak Vinogradi is \\"stylishly clear, inconspicuous, economically rational and proportional to the people of all generations, offering the sense of harmony, simplicity and warmth\\". The neighborhood remains one of the last integrally planned urban units in Belgrade and the superior achievements in the entire Yugoslav architecture. Authors (Milenija and Darko Maru≈°iƒá and Nedeljko Borovnica) won The October prize (–ûktobarska nagrada) for the Cerak Vinogradi project in 1985.  Transportation  Cerak Vinogradi is a few minutes away from the park-forest of Ko≈°utnjak, a short bus ride from major commercial center of Banovo Brdo, river Sava and the island and lake of Ada Ciganlija. It is also well connected with the rest of the city by public bus (GSP Belgrade) lines 23, 37, 50, 51, 52, 53, 56, 59, 89, 531, 532, 533 and 534.

British General William Howe, after unsuccessfully attempting to draw the Continental Army under General George Washington into a battle in northern New Jersey, embarked his army on transports, and landed them at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay. From there, he advanced northward toward Philadelphia. Washington prepared defenses against Howe's movements at Brandywine Creek, but was flanked and beaten back in the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777. After further skirmishes and maneuvers, Howe was able to enter and occupy Philadelphia. Washington then unsuccessfully attacked one of Howe's garrisons at Germantown before retreating to Valley Forge for the winter. Howe's campaign was controversial because, although he successfully captured the American capital of Philadelphia, he proceeded slowly and did not aid the concurrent campaign of John Burgoyne further north, which ended in disaster at Saratoga for the British, and brought France into the war. General Howe resigned during the occupation of Philadelphia and was replaced by his second-in-command, General Sir Henry Clinton. Clinton evacuated the troops from Philadelphia back to New York City in 1778 in order to increase that city's defenses against a possible Franco-American attack. Washington harried the British army all the way across New Jersey, and successfully forced a battle at Monmouth Court House that was one of the largest battles of the war. At the end of the campaign the two armies were roughly in the same positions they were at its beginning. Background Following General William Howe's successful capture of New York City, and George Washington's successful actions at Trenton and Princeton, the two armies settled into an uneasy stalemate in the winter months of early 1777. While this time was punctuated by numerous skirmishes, the British army continued to occupy outposts at New Brunswick and Perth Amboy, New Jersey. George Germain General Howe had proposed to George Germain, the British civilian official responsible for conduct of the war, an expedition for 1777 to capture Philadelphia, the seat of the rebellious Second Continental Congress. Germain approved his plan, although with fewer troops than Howe requested.Ketchum, p. 81 He also approved plans by John Burgoyne for an expedition to \\"force his way to Albany\\" from Montreal.Ketchum, pp. 85‚Äì86 Germain's approval of Howe's expedition included the expectation that Howe would be able to assist Burgoyne, effecting a junction at Albany between the forces of Burgoyne and troops that Howe would send north from New York City.Ketchum, p. 104 Howe decided by early April against taking his army overland to Philadelphia through New Jersey, as this would entail a difficult crossing of the broad Delaware River under hostile conditions, and it would likely require the transportation or construction of the necessary watercraft.Martin, p. 15 Howe's plan, sent to Germain on April 2, also effectively isolated Burgoyne from any possibility of significant support, since Howe would be taking his army by sea to Philadelphia, and the New York garrison would be too small for any significant offensive operations up the Hudson River to assist Burgoyne. Howe's evolving plans General Sir William Howe Washington realized that Howe \\"certainly ought in good policy to endeavor to Cooperate with Genl. Burgoyne\\" and was baffled why he did not do so.John E. Ferling, The First of Men: A Life of George Washington (2010) p. Washington at the time and historians ever since have puzzled over the reason Howe was not in place to come to the relief of General John Burgoyne, whose invasion army from Canada was surrounded and captured by the Americans in October. Historians agree that Lord Germain did a poor job in coordinating the two campaigns.Jeremy Black, War for America: The Fight for Independence, 1775‚Äì1783 (1998) pp. 117‚Äì21 Following Howe's capture of New York and Washington's retreat across the Delaware, Howe on December 20, 1776 wrote to Germain, proposing an elaborate set of campaigns for 1777. These included operations to gain control of the Hudson River, expand operations from the base at Newport, Rhode Island, and take the seat of the rebel Continental Congress, Philadelphia. The latter Howe saw as attractive, since Washington was then just north of the city: Howe wrote that he was \\"persuaded the Principal Army should act offensively [against Philadelphia], where the enemy's chief strength lies.\\"Ketchum, Saratoga (1999), p. 81 Germain acknowledged that this plan was particularly \\"well digested\\", but it called for more men than Germain was prepared to provide.Martin, p. 11 After the setbacks in New Jersey, Howe in mid-January 1777 proposed operations against Philadelphia that included an overland expedition and a sea-based attack, thinking this might lead to a decisive victory over the Continental Army.Gruber, The Howe Brothers in the American Revolution (1972), p. 183 This plan was developed to the extent that in April Howe's army was seen constructing pontoon bridges; Washington, lodged in his winter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey, thought they were for eventual use on the Delaware River.Ketchum, p. 61 However, by mid-May Howe had apparently abandoned the idea of an overland expedition: \\"I propose to invade Pennsylvania by sea ... we must probably abandon the Jersies.\\"Mintz, The Generals of Saratoga (1990), p. 117 Howe's decision to not assist Burgoyne may have been rooted in Howe's perception that Burgoyne would receive credit for a successful campaign, even if it required Howe's help; this would not help Howe's reputation, as the Philadelphia expedition would if it succeeded. Historian John Alden notes the jealousies among various British leaders, saying, \\"It is likely that [Howe] was as jealous of Burgoyne as Burgoyne was of him and that he was not eager to do anything which might assist his junior up the ladder of military renown.\\"Alden, The American Revolution (1954) p. 118 Along the same lines Don Higginbotham concludes that in Howe's view, \\"[The Hudson River campaign] was Burgoyne's whole show, and consequently he [Howe] wanted little to do with it. With regard to Burgoyne's army, he would do only what was required of him (virtually nothing).\\"Higginbotham, The War of American Independence (1971) p. 180. Howe himself wrote to Burgoyne on July 17: \\"My intention is for Pennsylvania, where I expect to meet Washington, but if he goes to the northward contrary to my expectations, and you can keep him at bay, be assured I shall soon be after him to relieve you.\\"Mintz, The Generals of Saratoga (1990) p. 164 He sailed from New York not long after. Early feints Portrait of George Washington by L√©on Cogniet Washington's Continental Army had been encamped primarily at Morristown, New Jersey, although there was a forward base at Bound Brook, only a few miles from the nearest British outposts. In part as a retaliatory measure against the ongoing skirmishes, General Charles Cornwallis executed a raid against that position in April 1777, in which he very nearly captured the outpost's commander, Benjamin Lincoln. In response to this raid, Washington moved his army forward to a strongly fortified position at Middlebrook in the Watchung Mountains that commanded likely British land routes toward Philadelphia. For reasons that are not entirely clear, General Howe moved a sizable army to Somerset Court House, south of New Brunswick. If he performed this move as a feint to draw Washington out from his strong position, it failed, as Washington refused to move his army out in force. Washington had intelligence that Howe had not brought the necessary equipment for either bringing or constructing watercraft, so this move seemed unlikely to him to be a move toward the Delaware River. When Howe eventually withdrew his army back toward Perth Amboy, Washington did follow. Launching a lightning strike, Howe sent forces under Cornwallis in an attempt to cut Washington off from the high ground; this attempt was foiled in the Battle of Short Hills. Howe then withdrew his troops to Perth Amboy, embarked them on transports, and sailed out of New York harbor, destined for Philadelphia. Washington did not know where Howe was going. Considering the possibility that Howe was again feinting, and would actually sail his army up the Hudson to join with Burgoyne, he remained near New York. Only when he received word that Howe's fleet had reached the mouth of the Delaware, did he need to consider the defense of Philadelphia. However, the fleet did not enter the Delaware, instead continuing south. Uncertain of Howe's goal, which could be Charleston, South Carolina, he considered moving north to assist in the defense of the Hudson, when he learned that the fleet had entered Chesapeake Bay. In August, he began moving his troops south to prepare the city's defenses. General John Sullivan, who commanded the Continental Army's troops facing Staten Island, had, in order to capitalize on perceived weaknesses of the British position there following Howe's departure, attempted a raid on August 22, that failed with the Battle of Staten Island. Capture of Philadelphia Hessian map of the campaign from August 25 ‚Äì September 26, 1777 General Howe landed 15,000 troops in late August at the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay, about 55 miles (90 km) southwest of Philadelphia. General Washington positioned 11,000 men between Howe and Philadelphia but was outflanked and driven back at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777 and suffered over 1,000 casualties, and the British lost about half that number.Higginbotham, The War of American Independence, pp. 181‚Äì86 The Continental Congress once again abandoned the city, relocating first to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and later York, Pennsylvania. British and Revolutionary forces maneuvered around each other west of Philadelphia for the next several days, clashing in minor encounters such as the abortive Battle of the Clouds and the so-called \\"Paoli Massacre.\\" On September 26, Howe finally outmaneuvered Washington and marched into Philadelphia unopposed. Capture of the rebel capital did not bring the end to the rebellion as the British thought it would. In 18th-century warfare, it was normal that the side who captured the opposing force's capital city won the war, but the Revolutionary War would continue for six more years until 1783 because of the rebels' unconventional warfare tactics. Operations on the Delaware River, Oct‚ÄìNov, 1777 After taking the city, the British garrisoned about 9,000 troops in Germantown, 5 miles (8 km) north of Philadelphia. On October 2 the British captured Fort Billingsport, on the Delaware in New Jersey, to clear a line of chevaux de frise obstacles in the river. The idea of placing those obstacles is attributed to Benjamin Franklin, and they were designed by Robert Smith.Robert Smith at Find a grave An undefended line had already been taken at Marcus Hook, and a third line was nearer Philadelphia, guarded by Fort Mifflin and Fort Mercer. Washington unsuccessfully attacked Germantown on October 4, and then retreated to watch and wait for the British to counterattack. Meanwhile, the British needed to open a supply route along the Delaware River to support their occupation of Philadelphia. After a prolonged defense of the river by Commodore John Hazelwood and the Continental and Pennsylvania Navies, the British finally secured the river by taking forts Mifflin and Mercer in mid-November (although the latter was not taken until after a humiliating repulse). In early December, Washington successfully repelled a series of probes by General Howe in the Battle of White Marsh.Higginbotham, The War of American Independence, pp. 186‚Äì88 General Washington's problems at this time were not just with the British. In the so- called Conway Cabal, some politicians and officers unhappy with Washington's performance in the campaign secretively discussed his removal. Washington, offended by the behind-the-scenes maneuvering, laid the whole matter openly before Congress. His supporters rallied behind him, and the episode was abated.Higginbotham, The War of American Independence, pp. 216‚Äì25 Valley Forge and Monmouth (Courthouse) Washington and his army encamped at Valley Forge in December 1777, about 20 miles (32 km) from Philadelphia, where they stayed for the next six months. Over the winter, 2,500 men (out of 10,000) died from disease and exposure. However, the army eventually emerged from Valley Forge in good order, thanks in part to a training program supervised by Baron von Steuben.Douglas Southall Freeman, Washington (1968) pp. 381‚Äì82. The March to Valley Forge by William B. T. Trego, 1883 Meanwhile, there was a shakeup in the British command. General Howe resigned his command, and was replaced by Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton as commander-in-chief. France's entry into the war forced a change in British war strategy, and Clinton was ordered by the government to abandon Philadelphia and defend New York City, now vulnerable to French naval power. The British sent out a peace commission headed by the Earl of Carlisle, whose offers, made in June 1778 as Clinton was preparing to abandon Philadelphia, were rejected by Congress. As the British were preparing their withdrawal, Washington sent out Lafayette on a reconnaissance mission. Lafayette narrowly escaped a British ambush at the Battle of Barren Hill. Clinton shipped many Loyalists and most of his heavy equipment by sea to New York, and evacuated Philadelphia on June 18. Washington's army shadowed Clinton's, and Washington successfully forced a battle at Monmouth Courthouse on June 28, the last major battle in the North. Washington's second-in-command, General Charles Lee, who led the advance force of the army, ordered a controversial retreat early in the battle, allowing Clinton's army to regroup. By July, Clinton was in New York City, and Washington was again at White Plains, New York. Both armies were back where they had been two years earlier. Aftermath Shortly after the British arrived in New York, a French fleet arrived outside its harbor, leading to a flurry of action by both sides. The French and Americans decided to make an attempt on the British garrison at Newport, Rhode Island; this first attempt at coordination was a notable failure. Under orders from London, Clinton reallocated some of his troops to the West Indies, and began a program of coastal raiding from the Chesapeake to Massachusetts. In and around New York, the armies of Clinton and Washington watched each other and skirmished, with occasional major actions like the 1779 Battle of Stony Point and the 1780 Battle of Connecticut Farms. Clinton considered making new attacks on Philadelphia, but these ideas never came to fruition. The British also began a wider frontier war organized from Quebec City, using Loyalist and Native American allies. British and French forces engaged each other in the West Indies and in India beginning in 1778, and the 1779 entry of Spain into the war widened the global aspects of the war even further. In 1780, the British began a \\"southern strategy\\" to regain control of the rebelling colonies,John E. Ferling, The First of Men: A Life of George Washington (2010) ch 9 with the capture of Charleston, South Carolina. This effort would ultimately fail at Yorktown.

The car saw limited action during the Battle of France. The manufacturer had insufficient capacity for production of the armoured car alongside their artillery tractors, so the design and construction techniques were passed to Rootes and used as a basis for the Humber Armoured Car Development In 1938, Guy Motors built five Guy Quad armoured car prototypes to a design by the Woolwich Arsenal based on the Quad Ant artillery tractor chassis.Accession Record In early 1938, a number of different 4√ó4 chassis from British and foreign manufacturers had been tested to see which was the best for development of a new line of armoured cars to replace those older designs in use. By September, three armoured cars had been built by Guy. While chassis with more advanced features were seen as having better potential, it was decided that in order to get production under way the Guy chassis was preferred. The vehicles successfully completed troop trials and from 1939‚Äì1940 a further 101 of the armoured cars ‚Äì initially designated \\"Tank, Light, (Wheeled) Mark I\\" ‚Äì were produced. While the contract specification had been for riveted construction, they were actually welded following Guy's suggestion that this would be more suitable and effective. To that end, they developed the necessary techniques including rotating jigs, which meant the bodies and turrets could be produced quicker and cheaper. The Royal Commission for Awards to Inventors recognised this after the war. The vehicle had a welded hull (making it the first British armoured car with an all-welded construction) with a sloped glacis plate. Above the centre of the hull was mounted a turret with two Vickers or Besa machine guns. The engine was located at the rear. The vehicle carried a No. 19 radio set. The body of the Guy vehicle formed the basis of the later Humber Armoured Car, which employed a new chassis. Service history Six cars were sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), but were lost when France fell to the Germans. Four cars, two each with the 12th Lancers and 2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry, had their guns removed and additional seats fitted in 1940 for use in the Coats Mission to evacuate King George VI, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret in the event of German invasion. The rest served with different British Army, Belgian Army, Danish and Dutch units stationed in Britain. By 1943, they were replaced by more modern vehicles.

It was a development of the marginal oscillator. Strictly one should distinguish between the marginal oscillator and the Robinson oscillator, although sometimes they are conflated and referred to as a Robinson marginal oscillator. Modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems are based on pulsed (or Fourier transform) NMR; they do not rely on the use of such oscillators. The key feature of a Robinson oscillator is a limiter in the feedback loop. This means that a square wave current, of accurately-fixed amplitude, is fed back to the tank circuit. The tank selects the fundamental of the square wave, which is amplified and fed back. This results in an oscillation with well-defined amplitude; the voltage across the tank circuit is proportional to its Q-factor. The marginal oscillator has no limiter. It is arranged for the working point of one of the amplifier elements to operate at a nonlinear part of its characteristic and this determines the amplitude of oscillation. This is not as stable as the Robinson arrangement. The Robinson oscillator was invented by British physicist Neville Robinson.  References  * Robinson, F. N.

Dickinson was one of the climbers caught in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. In 2003 he was the co-writer and director of Cloud Cuckoo Land‚Äîan independent British movie.IMDB  Biography  He was educated at The Hemel Hempstead School up to the age of sixteen and Gresham's School in Norfolk where he did his A levels. He joined the BBC in 1984, training as a researcher and production manager and working on programmes such as Wogan and Ever Decreasing Circles. Dickinson left in 1988 to pursue a freelance career as a production-director. In November 2015 Matt Dickinson visited schools across the UK to show students his achievements in his life, including to be part of the first camera crew to summit Mount Everest. Specialising in adventure documentaries, Matt Dickinson's credits include BBC 1's Classic Adventure and several hour-long films such as Channel 4's Encounters, Equinox and ITV's Network First. His programmes have been broadcast in more than thirty-five countries and have won awards at film festivals such as the Graz Mountain Film Festival, The Trento Mountain Film Festival and the Napa/Sonoma Film Festival. In the pre-monsoon Everest season of 1996, amid the worst weather conditions on record, with Alan Hinkes, Britain's foremost high-altitude climber, Dickinson made a successful ascent of Mount Everest's notorious North Face, one of the most technically demanding climbs on the world's highest peak, beating hurricane-force winds and temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius. Three of the eight deaths on Everest that day were on the North Face. He was climbing further up Everest when he came across the famous 'Green Boots' he was confused why someone would have fallen asleep on the north face of Everest but it was soon to occur to him that this body was no longer alive. It was an Indian climber that was separated from the rest of his team in 1996 and was found for the first time. He became one of the first British film-maker to film on the summit and return alive, and his film called Summit Fever has now been seen by more than twenty million people worldwide. His written account of the same expedition, The Death Zone (Random House) has been published to critical acclaim in more than fifteen different countries.

Rothblatt graduated from University of California, Los Angeles with J.D. and M.B.A. degrees in 1981, then began to work in Washington, D.C., first in the field of communications satellite law, and eventually in life sciences projects like the Human Genome Project. She is the founder and chairwoman of the board of United Therapeutics. She was also the CEO of GeoStar and the creator of SiriusXM Satellite Radio. She was the top earning CEO in the biopharmaceutical industry in 2018.  Early life and education  Born as Martin Rothblatt to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist, she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California. Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct- broadcast satellites. As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's \\"High Frontier\\" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS). During her four-year J.D./M.B.A. program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter. Career Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint J.D./M.B.A. degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as vice president by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System. Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney. She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) board of trustees. In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement his PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairman and CEO of United Therapeutics. Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990). Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig. She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services. As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998). Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension, Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996). That same year, she says, she had sex reassignment surgery. At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine. In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million. Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On December 5, 2017, North Carolina State University conferred her an honorary Doctor of Sciences degree. On May 11, 2010, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology. In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society. As of April 2018, Rothblatt earned a compensation package worth $37.1 million from United Therapeutics. The majority of the compensation package is for stock options. On May 16, 2018, Martine Rothblatt and Didi Chuxing President Jean Liu were awarded Doctors of Commercial Science degrees, honoris causa, at NYU's 186th Commencement at Yankee Stadium. In 2019 she was recognised as one of Business Insider's most powerful LGBTQ+ people in tech. In 2018, the University of Victoria's Chair in Transgender Studies, Founder and Academic Director of the Transgender Archives, nominated Martine for an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) from the University of Victoria, located in Victoria, British Columbia. She was officially awarded this on November 13, 2019, at the 10:00am graduation ceremony. = Aviation = (L-R) United Therapeutics CEO Martine Rothblatt, OC Helicopters Pilot Ric Webb, Tier 1 Engineering President Glen Dromgoole, United Therapeutics Executive Vice President Paul Mahon before a flight test at Los Alamitos Army Airfield. In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield. This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, president of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters. The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology. On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt's electric helicopter established new world records of a 30-minute duration flight and an 800-foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield. At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter. On December 7, 2018, Rothblatt earned certification in the Guinness Book of World Records for the farthest distance travelled (56.82 kilometers) by an electric helicopter. Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System. In 2018, Rothblatt received the American Helicopter Museum and Education Center Annual Achievement Award for innovation in rotary-wing flight. In 2019, she received the inaugural UP Leadership Award for her advances in eVTOL technology. = Sustainable building = In September 2018 Rothblatt inaugurated the world's largest site net-zero office building, called the Unisphere, containing 210,000 square feet of space in Silver Spring, Maryland, powered, heated and cooled completely from on-site sustainable energy technologies. This office building uses 1 MW of solar panels, fifty-two geothermal wells, a quarter mile long earth labyrinth and electrochromic glass to operate with a zero carbon footprint while graphically communicating its net energy status in real time to the building occupants.  Personal life  In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California. Rothblatt and Aspen each had a child from a previous relationship and legally adopted each other's children; they went on to have two more children together. In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights. = Social activism = In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a \\"Terasem Island\\" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims, which was constructed by the E-Spaces company. Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act or HB-2 law. Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about \\"the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality\\" and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds. Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district but lost. Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.  Reception  Lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can \\"preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology\\". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of \\"longevity products\\". Rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology. Carrico later criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and \\"mindclones\\" as being nothing more than wishful thinking. Carrico went on to criticize Rothblatt for caring more about rights of \\"virtual, uploaded persons\\"‚Äîwho he argues are neither real nor possible‚Äîmore than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins. Describing a conversation with BINA48, one of \\"humanity's first cybernetic companions,\\" created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics, journalist Amy Harmon concluded it was \\"not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects.\\" In September 2017 Forbes magazine named Rothblatt one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds of the past century, with special reference to her roles as a \\"perpetual reinventor, founder of Sirius and United Therapeutics, and creator of PanAmSat.\\" In January 2018 Rothblatt was presented the UCLA Medal, the university's highest award, in recognition of her creation of Sirius XM satellite radio, advancing organ transplant technology, and having \\"expanded the way we understand fundamental concepts ranging from communication to gender to the nature of consciousness and mortality.\\" In 2019, Rothblatt received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Sir Peter Jackson during the International Achievement Summit in New York City.

He was active in many anti-South Vietnamese organizations before joining the newly created Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam as the Minister of Justice. He spent many years in the jungles near and in Cambodia until the Fall of Saigon in 1975. He quickly became disillusioned with the newly imposed North Vietnamese regime and escaped the reunited Socialist Republic of Vietnam via a boat in August 1978. He was sent to a refugee camp in Indonesia before moving to Paris, France, to live out his life in exile. Early life T·∫£ng grew up in Saigon as one of six sons of a rich father who owned a rubber plantation and a printing house and taught (\\"for pleasure\\") at the Coll√®ge Chasseloup- Laubat; since his father intended him to be a pharmacist, after studying (exclusively in French) at the Coll√®ge Chasseloup-Laubat, T·∫£ng was sent to Hanoi University for a year and then (after a delay caused by the violence attendant on the end of World War II in Vietnam) to France in 1946 to study pharmacy. While in Paris, however, T·∫£ng was introduced to the movement for Vietnamese independence, met H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, and transferred to the √âcole des Sciences Politiques, where he focused on military and diplomatic subjects and was especially drawn to Marxist writings on colonialism. When he refused to return to Saigon at his father's command, he was cut off and had to work as a dishwasher to earn his living. By 1951, he had completed his studies, having earned a master's degree in political science and having gone on to take a licentiate in law at the University of Paris. However, at the end of the year, he returned to Vietnam at his father's urgent request to help put his brothers through school. To avoid draft into the South Vietnamese army, he joined the newly created French School of Naval Supply in 1954. At the end of 1955, he took a job as Controller-General of the Viet-Nam Bank for Industry and Commerce, but he also became involved in opposition to the Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám government. Anti-government organizer Through contacts that he had made during his studies in France, T·∫£ng became involved in the anti-government activities in South Vietnam. His position as corporate executive gave him access to the ruling circle and he could easily recruit non-communist anti- government people. Through this time he became close friends with co- conspirator Albert Th·∫£o until Th·∫£o's death in 1965. In February 1965, he was arrested and held for six months by the National Police and held in jail under suspicion of being part of the Self-Determination Movement, an anti-government group opposed to the Di·ªám regime (the Di·ªám regime had already ceased in 1963, two years earlier). After his wife paid a US$5,000 (US$ in ) bribe to the South Vietnamese military tribunal, T·∫£ng was sentenced to just two years, which were then suspended. His arrest did not stop T·∫£ng's activities and he continued his urban organizing of anti-government forces before being arrested a second time. Arrest and life in the jungle On June 16, 1966, he was pulled over by agents working under General Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan. He was held at a National Police secret prison where he was tortured and held without charge. An anti-government agent, Ba Tra, had been arrested and gave the South Vietnamese government extensive information on anti-government forces working in the city. Ba Tra was held and tortured for about two weeks before signing a confession that he was a communist. Another bribe by his wife of US$6000 (US$ in ) got him transferred to National Police headquarters where, in a small cell, he spent the next six months. In February 1967, he and two other women anti-government organizers, San No and Duy Lien, were part of a secret prisoner exchange for two American prisoners. The three were handed over to American forces and then flown out to the jungle where they were handed over to Vi·ªát C·ªông operatives. During his stay in the jungles of South Vietnam, he was one of the founders of the Vi·ªát C·ªông, or National Liberation Front (The NLF had already been established in 1960, seven years earlier), and Minister of Justice for the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG) during the Vietnam War. In April 1970, he was part of the escape of the Provisional Revolutionary Government when the military and civilian leadership of PRG and NLF were almost wiped out by ARVN forces. Disillusionment After the Fall of Saigon, T·∫£ng emerged from the jungle after more than eight years. The nature of the collapse of the South Vietnamese regime and the total victory of the North Vietnamese military gave total control to the North Vietnamese. The nationalist forces in the south were brushed aside in favour of communist cadres from the north. In 1978, only two years after North Vietnamese forces finally took Saigon and united Vietnam under the Communist rule, T·∫£ng became disillusioned with the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, which he believed did not give equal standing to southern sympathizers. Not helping matters was the imprisonment of two of his brothers in North Vietnamese reeducation camps. While it was supposed to last only thirty days, the imprisonment of his younger brother, Bich, a director at the National Bank, was prolonged, and he was released only after many months of lobbying on the part of T·∫£ng. The older brother, Quynh, a doctor who worked with the Health Ministry, was moved to a high security camp in the north where he was incarcerated at least until 1985. After spending some time in exile in the Vietnamese countryside, T·∫£ng decided to leave the country before things got worse. Through friends of his wife, he and others pooled their money to buy a boat which they boarded in August 1978. While on the open ocean, they tried to flag down ships patrolling the busy shipping lanes. However none of the freighters would stop to pick them up, and they drifted further and further south. They were attacked by Thai pirates who stole money and valuables from the passengers but let the boat continue on. Their boat travelled almost to Indonesia before coming across an Indonesian oil platform. Stopping there, they were picked up by UN ships and taken to a refugee camp on Galang Island, Indonesia. From there, T·∫£ng went into exile in Paris, and, in 1985, published a book about his life as a Viet Cong in the NLF and PRG. The book, A Vietcong Memoir, outlines not only his own experiences, but also the impact of the war among other revolutionaries.

It is located on Route 77, approximately southeast of Charleston. Etymology The name of the town is speculated to be originated from the Dutch city Deventer, Overijssel, The Netherlands. It is therefore very well possible that Dutch immigrants settled in the area and named a nowadays unpopulated settlement \\"Deventer\\". However, an MA thesis from 1938Hamlett, Mayme L. \\"Place Names Of Six Southeast Counties Of Missouri.\\" M.A. thesis., University of Missouri-Columbia, 1938. has a completely different reason for naming it Deventer: in this small settlement in the eastern part of Mississippi Township, a post office was established in 1910. Mr. Frank May, a prominent landowner, asked for the post office to be established and Mr. Dave Reeves, also a landowner, went on his bond when he made application for the position of postmaster. Eight names were submitted by Mr. May to the government. These were: Earl, for a friend of Mr. May and Mr. Reeves; Reeves, for Mr. Reeves; Harris, for the father of C.P. Harris; Mayville, for Mr. May; Boyce, for a friend; Tinner, for a landowner; and Prat, for another landowner. The last name, Deventer, for Deventer Miller, now in the insurance business in St. Louis, but then a clerk in a store in Oran, and friend of Mr. May, was the name which was accepted by the postal authorities.

The station is owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. KAAH's studios are located on Smith Street in downtown Honolulu, and its transmitter is located on Palehua Ridge, north of Makakilo. On cable, the station is available on Oceanic Spectrum channel 26 throughout most of the state, with the exception of the island of Hawai'i (the \\"Big Island\\"), where KAAH is not carried at all. History Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters applied for the channel 26 allocation in 1978 under the umbrella name Mauna Kea Broadcasting Company. KSHO signed on the air December 23, 1982 as Hawaii's first television station operating on the UHF band. Originally operating as a general entertainment independent station, the station offered a lineup of cartoons, sitcoms, drama series and movies during its early years. The station also aired Asian programming, primarily on weekends. In its early days, it carried business news programming from the Financial News Network, ethnic programming from the International Television Network, and carried ABC, CBS, and NBC programs that KITV (channel 4), KGMB (then on channel 9, now on channel 5) and KHON-TV (channel 2, now a Fox affiliate) chose to decline; programming from ABC's daytime lineup that was preempted by KITV was the most visible on KSHO's schedule. At the same time that channel 26 launched, the station would get more competition when KIKU (channel 13, now KHNL), which had a part-English/part-Japanese programming schedule up until 1980 when it reverted to an English-language general entertainment format but retained some Asian language programs airing during the day, began adding more English-language programming and moved most of its Japanese programming to Sundays in an effort to be more competitive with KSHO. That would later be followed by the debuts of four additional stations that also added English-language first-run programming at the time: KHAI-TV (channel 20, now KIKU, no relation to the present-day KHNL that once bore those call letters) in 1983, KWHE (channel 14) and KBFD (channel 32) in 1986, and KFVE (then on channel 5, now on channel 9) in 1987. In between that period, channel 26 changed its call letters to KMGT in 1986. From 1986 to 1990, the station was branded as \\"K-Magic\\"‚Äîand even carried Los Angeles Lakers basketball games featuring Magic Johnson (who, in one promo for \\"K-Magic\\", said, \\"What a great name for a TV station!\\"). By 1989, KHNL and KFVE had taken the first- and second-tier syndicated movies and reruns meant for broadcast by independent stations, and KMGT was running a schedule of lower-budget programs. Knowing the station was a money-losing proposition, Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters sold KMGT to Oceania Broadcasting Network for $4.3 million. By 1990, KMGT began phasing out general entertainment programming in favor of carrying Home Shopping Network and religious programming from TBN as a dual affiliate; the station eventually changed its call letters to KOBN in 1992. The following year, the station was sold to All American Broadcasting (a company with no relationship whatsoever with the syndicator known as All American Television). In 1996, the station would switch call letters again to KAAH; it dropped HSN programming that year and began carrying TBN programming full-time. The Trinity Broadcasting Network would later buy the station outright in 2003; however, although it is owned by a nonprofit broadcaster that operates mainly non-commercial stations, KAAH-TV continues to be licensed by the Federal Communications Commission as a commercial outlet (three other religious stations in the market‚ÄîKKAI (channel 14), KWHE-TV (channel 14) and KUPU (channel 15)‚Äîare also licensed as commercial stations, although only the latter two carry secular programming). KAAH operated KLEI in Kailua-Kona as a satellite station during the 1990s; that station is now a full-power standalone outlet serving as an affiliate of Telemundo. KAAH formerly operated a low-power repeater station, K34HC in Hilo. TBN took K34HC off-the-air on April 13, 2010 due to declining financial support, which has been attributed to the digital transition. Digital television RabbitEars TV Query for KAAH =Analog-to-digital conversion= In February 2006, K34HC was granted a construction permit to begin converting operations to digital television prior to being taken off the air. Had it been completed, the station would have broadcast at an effective radiated power of 15 kW. KAAH-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 26, on January 15, 2009, the date in which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts (six months earlier than the June 12 transition date for stations on the U.S. mainland). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 27, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 26.

Born in 1913 in Udine, Italy, Sergio made his first violin in 1943 before moving to Caracas, Venezuela, in 1947. There he primarily did repair work for the Venezuelan Symphony Orchestra and had a modest production of new instruments. He moved to Philadelphia in 1963 and was employed by William Moennig and Son. It was under the aegis of the Moennig shop that Peresson was finally able to see and copy the best instruments. He fashioned many copies of old masters (among them the 1743 'Spalding' Guarneri del Ges√π http://www.cozio.com/Instrument.aspx?id=5063 owned by concertmaster Norman Carol) and gained notoriety among players. He left Moennig in 1971 and established himself with a workshop in his home in Haddonfield, New Jersey.Deitch, Edward. \\"The Stradivari of Haddonfield\\", The New York Times, July 9, 1978. Accessed October 25, 2018. \\"Haddonfield - A Photograph of Sergio Peresson shows him sitting at his workbench, holding a violin that he made..... The picture is on a wall in Mr. Peresson's second‚Äêfloor workshop in his home in this quiet Philadelphia suburb.\\" It is generally acknowledged that Peresson's finest instruments were crafted from about the mid 1970s to the early 1980s. Soloists who have owned and performed on Peresson instruments include: Isaac Stern, Yehudi Menuhin, Ivan Galamian, William DePasquale, Pinchas Zukerman, Norman Carol, Jaime Laredo, Eugene Fodor, Maria Bachmann, Lenuta Ciulei, Mstislav Rostropovich, Jacqueline du Pr√©, and Alexander Markov who performed his famous recording of Paganini's 24 Caprices on a 1970 Peresson violin.http://www.violinist.com/blog/laurie/20146/15886/ Peresson mostly made violins and violas, but his cellos are exceptional. Norman Carol, former concertmaster of the Philadelphia Orchestra and owner of two Peresson violins, called him \\"the most outstanding maker\\" in the world. From 1970, du Pr√©'s primary performance instrument was a Peresson cello. Commissioned by her husband Daniel Barenboim in 1970, it was used in the live 1970 recording of the Elgar Cello Concerto, with Barenboim conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. After du Pr√©'s death in 1987 the instrument passed to Alison Eldridge for a time, and is on loan from Barenboim to Kyril Zlotnikov of the Jerusalem String Quartet. In 1982, Peresson stopped taking new orders for his instruments because he couldn't meet the demand. There was a waiting list of 180 musicians who had placed orders, said his wife, Margit. Although his instruments sound like those of the Stradivarius or Guarnerius instruments, Peresson liked to think there is also a distinct Peresson sound. He firmly believed that important elements in any musical instrument are a beautiful and rich tone, carrying or projecting power, and being responsive to the fingers of the player. He likened violin making to violin playing, in that with both, the genuinely great can be distinguished easily from the good. Mrs. Peresson sent a message on her late husband's behalf: \\"My instruments are my own model, and in my opinion the principal qualities of an ideal violin, viola or violoncello are beauty, quality, evenness and clarity of tone, rich sonority, powerful projection, and quick and easy response.\\" Quotations References * Il liutaio Sergio Peresson (1913-1991), Pizzicato ed. musicali, Udine 2001, written by Lorenzo Nassimbeni *1743 Spalding Guarneri del Ges√π 1913 births 1991 deaths Luthiers Bowed string instrument makers People from Haddonfield, New Jersey ","title":"Sergio Peresson"},{"id":"4332249","text":"Barrhead station in 1970 Barrhead railway station is a railway station in the town of Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, Greater Glasgow, Scotland. The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Glasgow South Western Line, southwest of .  History  The station was opened by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway on 27 September 1848. The line southwards beyond Neilston (Low) to via Dunlop (the Glasgow and Kilmarnock Joint Railway) was added between 1871 & 1873 by the Glasgow and South Western Railway and Caledonian Railway, giving travellers access to the G&SWR; main line to Dumfries and Carlisle. The GB&NDR; had originally been absorbed by the Caledonian Railway three years after completion, but was subsequently vested jointly into the CR and G&SWR; by an Act of Parliament in 1869 in order to facilitate the extension southwards.\\"Glasgow, Barrhead & Kilmarnock Joint Railway\\" Speller, J spellerweb.net; Retrieved 30 August 2016 Regular passenger services to the former G&SWR; terminus at St Enoch ended with its closure in June 1966 - all services from here have henceforth used the former Caledonian station at Glasgow Central as their terminal. The section south of here towards Kilmarnock was singled (with a loop at ) in 1973 as an economy measure, following the completion of electrification work on the Carlisle to Glasgow Central section of the West Coast Main Line. The original G&SWR; main line from Kilmarnock to was also closed to all traffic that year, leaving the line through here as the only available one for Kilmarnock to Glasgow trains. The section south of Lugton has since been partially redoubled, but Barrhead to Lugton remains single. This section is steeply graded in parts, with southbound services having to negotiate a climb of at 1 in 67-70 upon departure . A signal box remains in operation to supervise the station area and control the single line stretch southwards.  Facilities  The station has three platforms - one north-east facing bay (on the north-west side) specifically for terminating services and two through platforms, 1 and 2, which can be used for any service. A ticket machine serves platforms 2 and 3 whilst there is a staffed ticket office at street level adjacent to platform 1 (manned Monday - Saturday 06:50 - 23:15, Sunday 09:10 - 16:50). There are toilets and a pay phone on the concourse next to the ticket office.

Early life Gray was born in Bournemouth, Dorset, the son of Maude Elizabeth (n√©e Marshall) and Donald Gray, who was a surveyor. Gray attended Bournemouth School alongside Benny Hill, whose school had been evacuated to the same buildings, during the Second World War. Some of his friends remember that his bedroom walls were plastered with pictures of film stars. Stage career By his mid-twenties, Gray had left his first job as a clerk for an estate agent to become an actor. He began his stage experience at the theatre club next to the Palace Court Hotel in Bournemouth, where he was a last-minute cast replacement in The Beaux' Stratagem. Gray surprised everyone, including himself, with the quality of his performance. He moved away from Bournemouth in the late 1950s, but his parents remained at the family home until their deaths. On becoming a professional actor he had to change his name, as there was already an actor named Donald Gray. He chose Charles Gray partly because Charles was the name of his maternal grandfather, partly because he had a close friend named Charles, and partly because he thought it sounded nice. For his first appearance on Broadway, in the 1961 musical Kean, he went under the name Oliver Gray. Charles Gray distinguished himself in theatrical roles, in the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, London, at the Royal Shakespeare Company, Stratford-Upon-Avon and at the Old Vic. He received his vocal training at the RSC and became noted for his imposing presence. Film and television During the 1960s, Gray established himself as a successful character actor and made many appearances on British television. Work in this period included Danger Man, with Patrick McGoohan, and Maigret. Gray also appeared opposite Laurence Olivier in the film version of The Entertainer (1960) as a reporter. In 1964, he played murderer Jack Baker in the Perry Mason episode, \\"The Case of the Bullied Bowler\\". His breakthrough year was 1967, when he starred with Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif in the Second World War murder-mystery film The Night of the Generals. The following year he played Dikko Henderson, an Australian intelligence officer assigned to their Embassy in Tokyo, in the Bond film You Only Live Twice (1967). Four years later, he appeared as Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever, both films starring Sean Connery as James Bond. Gray's most prolific work as an actor was between 1968 and 1979, when he appeared in more than forty major film and television productions. From this period, he is perhaps best known for portraying the Criminologist (the narrator) in The Rocky Horror Picture Show and a similar character, Judge Oliver Wright, in its sequel Shock Treatment (1981). This more expansive role is said to be the same character (the Criminologist in The Rocky Horror Picture Show is not named). In 1973, he played Lord Seacroft in the television series The Upper Crusts opposite Margaret Leighton, and in 1983, he starred alongside Coral Browne and Alan Bates in the award-winning made-for-TV film An Englishman Abroad. In 1985, he starred in an episode of the BBC-TV detective series Bergerac, entitled \\"What Dreams May Come?\\". Other well-known film work includes The Devil Rides Out, Mosquito Squadron, Cromwell and The Beast Must Die. In 1991, Gray co-starred with Oliver Tobias in the science-fiction film Firestar - First Contact for Ice International Films. Later work Gray portrayed Mycroft Holmes in both the film The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976) and opposite Jeremy Brett's Sherlock in four episodes of the Granada Television series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1984). In two episodes of the final Brett series, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, he had leading roles as Mycroft, the first because Edward Hardwicke, who played Doctor Watson, was busy on another project and the second as a result of Brett's illness. Other television appearances included roles in Dennis Potter's Blackeyes, The New Statesman, Thriller, Upstairs, Downstairs, Bergerac, Porterhouse Blue plus a range of Shakespearean roles, such as Caesar in Julius Caesar and Pandarus in Troilus and Cressida. He dubbed for Jack Hawkins in the film Theatre of Blood and others after Hawkins's larynx was removed to combat throat cancer. Death Gray died on 7 March 2000. He never married.

The word means \\"old\\" based on the adjective \\"old (feminine)\\".: The adjective derives ultimately from the PIE root *«µerh2-/*«µreh2-, \\"to grow old\\" via Proto-Greek *gera-/grau-iu. History According to the historian Georg Busolt, the Graecians were among the first to colonize Italy (i.e., Magna Graecia) in the 9th century BC when they established the city of Cumae; they were the first Greeks with whom the Latins came into contact, which then made them adopt the name of Graeci by synecdoche as the name of the Hellenes. Aristotle (4th-century BC) records that during the deluge of Deucalion, the Graecians were the inhabitants of Hellas (i.e., \\"the country about Dodona and the Achelous [river]\\") who were also known as Hellenes.Aristotle.

Their career is generally agreed to have peaked with the album Alright Jack, and has had an influence on later work. John Tams and several other members of the band, have had solo careers and worked in other projects. In 2016 John Kirkpatrick replaced Tams as main singer in Home Service, and features as such on their next album. History =Origins= Home Service was formed out of members of the Albion Band, who had participated in recording Rise Up Like the Sun (1978). Their establishment was partly out of the confusion caused by line-up changes when the Albion Band were playing as, in effect, a house band in Bill Bryden's National Theatre productions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including Lark Rise to Candleford. Members of the group took part in an adaptation of Michael Herr's Dispatches without band leader Ashley Hutchings. In late 1980, eight members began to rehearse together in Southwark, London and had soon splintered off from the parent band.Sleeve notes for Alright Jack reissue (Fledg'ling, 1997). The original line-up was: John Tams (vocals, melodeon), Bill Caddick (vocals, guitar, dobro), Graeme Taylor (vocals, guitar), Michael Gregory (drums), Roger Williams (trombone, tuba), Howard Evans (trumpet), Colin Rae (trumpet) and Malcolm Bennett (bass). The large group was somewhat unwieldy and complicated by other projects, including the fact that both Evans and Williams were also members of Brass Monkey. Rae soon left and the remaining members initially chose the name 'The First Eleven' and then switched to Home Service, which had both associations of Britishness/Englishness and of a bygone world in the defunct BBC Home Service radio station. =Early recordings= In 1982, two tracks from what was initially intended as a demo session were released as a single, \\"Doing The Inglish\\", with the B-side \\"Bramsley\\", designed to accompany the group's appearance at the Cambridge Folk Festival and their transmission on the BBC TV programme A Little Night Music. Bass player Malcolm Bennett then left the band to work as Musical Director of the National Theatre's production of Aeschylus' Oresteia and was replaced by Jon Davie. Further recording was delayed by their return to the National Theatre as a supporting band. Having been joined by keyboard player Steve King while recording, among considerable expectations, they released their eponymous first album in 1984. The album made good use of their two experienced songwriters, Tams and Caddick, and the arranging talents in the group for a mixture of original songs and traditional tunes. The result was favourably reviewed, but suffered in retrospect from the fragmented nature of the recording process among their busy schedules, leading to a lack of spontaneity. Theatre productions continued to dominate the group's existence, particularly Brydon‚Äôs trilogy based on the Wakefield cycle of mystery plays known as The Mysteries. Augmented by other musicians, including Linda Thompson on vocals and Andy Findon on saxophone, clarinet and flutes, they released a selection of the music as The Mysteries in 1985. Findon joined the band as a full member, but Bill Caddick, unhappy with the lack of live work, left the group soon after the end of the play's London run. =Alright Jack= With this line up the band began working on their third album, attempting to use their considerable talents to the full and overcome the problems that had limited their previous work. The result, Alright Jack (1985), was built around an arrangement of six folk songs by Percy Grainger. There were also three other traditional tunes, but the most striking element of the album were Tams' compositions, which bracketed the traditional material on both sides, including the title track, the apocalyptic and uplifting \\"Sorrow/Babylon\\" and the haunting \\"Scarecrow\\". Alright Jack was the group's greatest achievement and almost their last. Tams left soon after and the remaining members gradually moved on to other projects. =Later work= They reunited, without Tams, in 1991 to contribute to the charity compilation All Through the Year and with Caddick toured the UK, recordings of which were released as Wild Life (1995), but they disbanded soon after. In 2011, it was announced that Home Service were reuniting for live performances. The reunion was taking place to promote a forthcoming album of previously unheard live recordings from 1986. In 2015, Tams retired from Home Service and was replaced by John Kirkpatrick as main singer. Kirkpatrick features as such on their first new album, A New Ground.

The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Glasgow South Western Line.  History  The original Kilmaurs station was opened on 26 June 1873 by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway. The buildings on the Up platform (the platform for trains to Kilmarnock and the South) were destroyed by fire in 1914 and replaced by a brick building which, until its closure in 1966, was the only one in south west Scotland to be centrally heated. To the south of the station, a signal box containing 17 levers controlled the section and allowed access to a goods yard. The station officially closed on 7 November 1966. The current station opened on 12 May 1984 by British Rail. Platform extension work started in September 2009 to cater for longer units associated with the track doubling works between Stewarton and Lugton. Being so close to Kilmarnock station the guards often failed to sell tickets to all passengers travelling to Kilmarnock. In 2012 a ticket machine was installed at the station.  Service  = 2019 service pattern = Since the doubling of the line between Lugton and Stewarton in December 2009 the service pattern has been: * Mondays to Saturdays - a mainly half-hourly service northbound to Glasgow Central and southbound to , with selected services extended beyond Kilmarnock towards either Carlisle & Newcastle or Girvan, Ayr and Stranraer. * Sundays - hourly each way served by trains between Glasgow Central and Kilmarnock, with a few extended south towards Dumfries and Carlisle.

He was previously a Director-General at the Department of Health and a member of the Management Board of the National Health Service (NHS) in England (July 2007‚ÄìSeptember 2009), as well as Chief Executive of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and the South Central Strategic Health Authority. Career Having studied history at the University of Warwick, he joined the fast-track NHS Management Training Scheme in 1989, receiving his post-graduate education at Warwick Business School at the University of Warwick.Britnell profile in The Guardian His early career included various management posts in the NHS, a spell with the Australian health service, a year in the civil service fast stream during which he was sponsored by the Australian College of Health Service Executives to work in Melbourne and Sydney before being seconded to the NHS Executive in 1992. Britnell joined St Mary's Hospital in London as a General Manager before being appointed as a Director at Central Middlesex Hospital (now part of North West London Hospitals NHS Trust) in 1995, when he was named Project Director for an Ambulatory Care and Diagnostic (ACAD) Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme - the first of its kind in the UK.Britnell biodata at the UK Department of Health At 34 years of age, he became chief executive at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the youngest people to be appointed to a chief executive role in the NHS.Britnell profile in The Guardian Britnell had previously been chief operating officer there. He led the organization from 1998 to 2006. As one of the highest performing trusts he took it to NHS Foundation Trust status as part of the so-called 'first wave' of organisations to be approved. He also secured the largest PFI single hospital build in England and established the first Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in partnership with the Ministry of Defence.We Must Sell Healthcare to the Whole World, Mark Britnell, The Times, 23 January 2013 In 2006 he was appointed as chief executive of the NHS South Central strategic health authority (which covered an area from Oxford to the Isle of Wight). He was Director-General for Commissioning and System Management for the National Health Service (NHS) of England (July 2007-September 2009). During this time he oversaw the development of the World Class Commissioning policy, the creation of the Cooperation and Competition Panel and reforms to primary care, patient and public engagement, integrated care and community services. Later his major focus was working with Lord Ara Darzi to develop High Quality Care for All, the final report of the Next Steps Review on the future of the NHS. He has twice been tipped as a likely contender for the post of NHS Chief Executive (in 2006 and 2013) but in both instances declined to apply.Mark Britnell, Patrick Butler, The Guardian, 19 September 2001 Mark Britnell rules himself out of NHS England Chief race, Dave West, Health Service Journal, 17 October 2013 In 2009 he joined KPMG as Head of Health for the UK and Europe, becoming Global Chairman for Health in 2010 and Global Chairman and Senior Partner for Healthcare, Government and Infrastructure in 2018, responsible for 40,000 staff across 157 countries. He reports that in these roles he has worked in 80 countries on more than 345 occasions. He finishes his global role in 2020, and will remain as a UK health partner for KPMG. Books In October 2015 Britnell published 'In Search of the Perfect Health System',In Search of the Perfect Health System: Palgrave.co.uk an analysis of 25 national health systems around the world and seven key trends facing healthcare globally. It won the health and social care category in the British Medical Association's Medical Book Awards 2016 and Best Health Book in China in 2017 from the Chinese Medical Doctors Association. The book is published in Mandarin, Portuguese and Korean, and the publisher has reported that it has been sold in 109 countries. In March 2019 he published 'Human: solving the global workforce crisis in healthcare'. It is a response to the warning from the World Health Organization that by 2030 there will be a global shortage of around 18 million healthcare workers ‚Äì about a fifth of the required workforce. Britnell argues that no country, no matter how wealthy, can buy its way out of this crisis. Instead it requires concerted international action on 10 major aspects of healthcare including productivity, the role of women in the professions, integrating artificial intelligence with human systems, the quality and style of leadership and breaking down institutional barriers which prevent clinicians from performing at the top of their game. He has subsequently argued that major reforms are even more urgent in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.Britnell, M, 'Protect the NHS' was an expression of anxiety, Health Service Journal, 28 July 2020 In 2020 'Human' was published in Mandarin. As a survivor of prostate cancer, Britnell gives the charity Prostate Cancer UK all the royalties from both books.

NHS competition controversy In 2010, while discussing British health reforms at a healthcare industry conference in the US, Britnell was quoted as stating: \\"In future, The NHS will be a state insurance provider not a state deliverer\\", and that \\"The NHS will be shown no mercy and the best time to take advantage of this will be in the next couple of years.\\"The Observer, 15 May 2011, \\"David Cameron's adviser says health reform is a chance to make big profits\\" Britnell refuted this. KPMG issued a press statement on his behalf on 16 May 2011 stating \\"The article in The Observer [15 May] attributes quotes to me that do not properly reflect discussions held at a private conference last October. Nor was I given the opportunity to respond ahead of publication. I worked in the NHS for twenty years and now work alongside it. I have always been a passionate advocate of the NHS and believe that it has a great future. Like many other countries throughout the world, the pressure facing healthcare funding and provision are enormous. If the NHS is to change and modernize the public, private and voluntary sectors will all need to play their part.\\" The Health Service Journal website published a longer statement from Britnell on 17 May, prompted by the article in The Observer. In it Britnell explained his perspective on the reform of the NHS. Among wide-ranging remarks he stated that \\"[o]f course, the vast majority of care - quite rightly in the UK context - will always be provided by public sector organisations (currently, about 95% of it) and will be paid out of taxation\\" and \\"[t]he issue of competition, which now seems to be conflated with privatisation, is unhelpful and misleading and, at best, only a small part of reform. Competition can exist without privatisation and the NHS can maintain its historic role in funding care while dealing with a richer variety of providers - public sector, social enterprise and private organisations\\".\\"Britnell responds to 'privatisation' storm\\" Commenting on the UK health service in an article for the Guardian Health Network, Britnell said \\"I'm proud to have worked for the NHS, with its great people, and now feel privileged to be able to work on health systems internationally.\\"The Guardian Health Network, 30 March 2012, \\"A Day in the life of Mark Britnell\\" Publications * In Search of the Perfect Health System, Palgrave 2015 * Human: Solving the global workforce crisis in healthcare, Oxford University Press 2019 References External links *Profile: Dr Mark Britnell, Global Head of Health, KPMG *Mark Britnell at the Department of Health, 11 March 2008 (archived) *Column archive at NHS/CPC Creative *Mark Britnell collected news and commentary at Health Service Journal 1966 births Living people Administrators in the National Health Service Alumni of the University of Warwick British civil servants English healthcare chief executives KPMG people Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mark Britnell"},{"id":"4332319","title":"Get Together (Madonna song)"},{"id":"4332321","text":"Reverse compensation, in United States broadcasting, is the practice of a commercial television station paying a television network in exchange for being permitted to affiliate with that network. The word \\"reverse\\" refers to the historical practice of networks paying stations to compensate them for the airtime networks use to run network advertisements during their programming. Reverse compensation first appeared in the 1990s, with The WB Television Network receiving reverse compensation from several stations. In 2001, San Jose, California station KNTV agreed to pay $362 million over ten years to become the NBC affiliate for the Bay Area market, the largest such agreement to date. Shortly after, NBC bought KNTV when the station's owner ran into financial difficulty.The Story At 11, Jeff Kearns, Metro (Bay Area), December 6, 2001 The practice played a role in the 2006 affiliation drives of two newly announced networks, The CW Television Network and My Network TV. The CW reportedly demanded reverse compensation from affiliates for an arguably proven, but still low-rated, primetime schedule; My Network made no such demand and also allowed stations to keep more ad time than a traditional network would.TV Station Execs Debate Choice..., MediaPost Publications, February 24, 2006 As a result, several stations that seemed to be good candidates to become CW affiliates, including most WB- and UPN-affiliated Sinclair Broadcast Group stations, announced affiliations with My Network instead, though in cases where Sinclair had market duopolies, eventually relented and affiliated the second stations with The CW before their launch.My Network TV Inks 17 Sinclair Affils, Katy Bachman, Mediaweek, March 6, 2006 Pappas Telecasting and Tribune Company, the two major station groups which did carry The CW, both filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008.Pappas Telecasting files for bankruptcy, blames CW ratings, Dow Jones May 10, 2008 Tribune, which operated the largest group of CW affiliates at the time of the network's launch, removed the network name from its stations' branding for a few years, until management changes returned the network branding to most of their affiliates.Tonight‚Äôs Top Story on Tribune‚Äôs TV Stations: Its Bankruptcy Filing, Brian Stelter, New York Times, December 8, 2008 In Canada, CTV attempted to move from a traditional network affiliation contract to a reverse compensation model in the early 2000s, which played a role in the disaffiliation of CHAN-TV in Vancouver, British Columbia and CJON-TV in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador from the network.

It was created by Stefan Gro√ümann and Tilo Ladwig in 1995.  History  The formation of Absurd Minds began in 1995 with Stefan Gro√ümann (voice, composing) and Tilo Ladwig (composing, programming, sampling). Musically they were inspired by the EBM of the early 1990s. The lyrics are inspired by religion and urge the listener to think for themselves, about themselves, about dreams, deceptions by the media and the forces of nature. In the years 1995-1999, Absurd Minds released 3 CD-R's in limited quantities, laying the foundation for further developments by the band. After a long creative phase their first concert took place at the Dresden club, Bunker. As a result of this, the band came into contact with Music Cooperation who undertook the job as management. A recording contract with the label, Scanner, followed in December, 1999. In the meantime, Absurd Minds played in Electromania II in Leipzig. The recording for their first single, \\"Brainwash\\" and album, Deception began in January, 2000. In March, the band played live at the Nostromo Festival in G√∂rlitz and opened for the Electromania III festival which was part of the Wave-Gotik-Treffen 2000. In December their second single, \\"Come Alive\\" appeared and in January, 2001 they began recording the album, Damn the Lie. During the work on this album the band took on a third member, Timo Fischer, who up to then had only played as reinforcement during live performances. Their third album The Focus followed in October 2003, with the singles 'Master Builder' and 'Herzlos' both doing well in the DAC. Another appearance at the Wave-Gotik Treffen followed in 2004, whilst the fourth Absurd Minds album Noumenon was released in November 2005. It would take another five years for Absurd Minds to release their fifth album, Serve or Suffer, in 2010.

There are three species in the genus Dyacopterus: D. spadiceus, D. brooksi and D. rickarti. All are found in the forests of Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Few specimens of any of the three species exist, due not only to their rarity, but also because they rarely enter the subcanopy of the forest where they can be caught in scientists' nets. Distribution D. spadiceus is considered a very rare fruit bat species in Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo and none in Thailand. The species were netted in four sites at Poring, Kubah, Kota Samarahan and Pontianak, all on Borneo. The specimens, MTA96268 and MTA96269, that were held at Tanjungpura University, are the first record for this distinctive species in Kalimantan Barat, Indonesian Borneo. Specimens UMS0010, MTA96237, and MTA96238 from Sarawak and MTA96208 from Sabah are new additional records for the species in the sampling areas. These new sites have extended the range of D. spadiceus to the western and southern parts of Borneo. Previous distribution records includes Selangor and Negeri Sembilan in Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra; Sepilok and Baturong Caves in Sabah; Baram and Niah areas in Sarawak (Medway 1978, Payne et al. 1985). Description The dayak bat averages less than 150 grams. It is gray-brown dorsally with a silver-gray ventral side. Its fur is short. It has a short tail, ranging from ten to twenty percent of its body length. Its wing membranes attach to the second toe on each foot. D. spadiceus is the smallest of the bats in the genus Dyacopterus. It has the smallest skull size, averaging less than 36.1 mm from the premaxilla to the base of the skull. It has a proportionally wide skull, however, when compared to the other bats in the genus. Diet The dayak bat is frugivorous, feeding on fruits from trees extending into or past the canopy of the forests of Malaysia. Figs are a staple of its diet, as are whatever fruits are seasonally available in the high canopy. D. spadiceus seems to prefer the fruits of old-growth Paleotropical rainforest, or montane rainforest. This makes them particularly susceptible to deforestation. Frugivorous bats are one of the main agents of seed dispersal in the rainforest, making them essential to the ecosystem. Biology and ecology A male and five female adults were mist-netted. Two females collected from Kalimantan Barat in September 1996 were in early and late pregnancy. Both bats were caught in a mist net placed near fruiting Ficus tree in disturbed peat swamp forest. Females from Kota Samarahan and Kubah were lactating in September 1994 and August 1996 respectively. Two individuals were caught in the subcanopy (between 10 ‚Äì 15 m ) by using a vertically-hoisted mist net placed in the Sungai Rayu at Kubah. The individual from Poring was caught in the emergent tree above the main canopy (> 30 m from the ground level). However, the two specimens from Kalimantan Barat were taken from the ground level nets in a peat swamp forest. There is no previous information on the biology and ecology for D. spadiceus as indicated by Medway (1978), Payne et al. (1985) and Mickleburg et al., (1992). Reproduction As there are few samples of Dyacopterus spadiceus, and no socioeconomic studies have been performed, there is little data available on the reproduction and habits of any of the Dyacopterus species. However, from information gained during studies of Malaysian fruit bats in general, D. spadiceus seems to be a monogamous species, with both sexes coming into sexual maturity when they reach 70 grams (approximately one-half adult body weight). While it is unknown how long the females gestate, females have been found carrying embryos from June to July, and have been found lactating from June until September. This would suggest a one- to two-month lactation time, after which the young is weaned and probably leaves the nest. Females have been found carrying either one or two embryos. In a study on the abundance of fruit bats in Malaysia, two fruit bats, one male, one pregnant female, were found roosting in a hollow limb of a fig tree. Paternal lactation The male of the D. spadiceus species is one of the known natural occurrences of paternal lactation. While the reasons the male would lactate are currently unknown, it could be a mechanism to take some of the pressure of lactation off the female. This may confer an evolutionary advantage in lactating males over other non-lactating males. See also *Mammals of Borneo References in Borneo * *Hall LS, Gordon G.

Solo singer  Tams has released three solo albums to date, Unity (2000), Home (2002) and The Reckoning (2005); all of which have met with critical acclaim. At the 2006 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, Tams won Best Album for The Reckoning, Best Traditional Track (for Bitter Withy) and Folk Singer of the Year. Tams is the only artist to have won the Album of the Year award twice, the first time was with his first solo album Unity in 2001. At the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2008 he and singing partner Barry Coope were presented with the prestigious Best Duo award from actor Sean Bean, alongside whom he acted in the Sharpe TV series. Tams has now received ten nominations, resulting in six BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. The book accompanying the Topic Records 70th anniversary boxed-set Three Score and Ten lists Unity as one of its classic albums, and two of Tams‚Äôs tracks appear in the collection: Bitter Withy from The Reckoning is track 16 on the first CD; and Unity (Raise Your Banners High) from Unity is track one on the fifth CD.  Radio producer  In 2006 Tams became musical director of the BBC Radio 2 2006 Radio Ballads, an updating of Ewan MacColl's Radio Ballads. The series was short-listed for two Sony Radio Awards in 2007. In the event it won a Sony Gold Radio Academy Award for Song of Steel and a Bronze award for Thirty Years of Conflict. It has been nominated for a Clarion Award. The song Steelos, written by Tams for the Song of Steel episode of the 2006 Ballads, was nominated Best Original Song at the 2006 Radio 2 Folk Awards. Currently, Tams is also working on a stage version of Steelos to be performed at the Magna Centre in the Rother Valley in 2009. He worked on John McCusker's commission 'Under One Sky' alongside Graham Coxon, Roddy Woomble, Julie Fowlis and others. In November 2007 Tams was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Sheffield Hallam University, then in January 2009 another Honorary Doctorate from Derby University. In November 2015 Tams was presented with a Gold Badge from the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS).  Personal life  Tams is married to Sally Ward, a Derbyshire Funeral Celebrant.

The station was opened on 6 October 1838 on the Dundee and Arbroath Railway. When North British Railway were granted joint ownership of the line on 21 July 1879, the station buildings were gradually rebuilt until around 1900. It is the oldest railway station in Scotland which is still in operation.  History  At 7:20 pm on 21 October 1991, a Dundee bound Aberdeen-London Intercity express destroyed two out of the four gates of the level crossing. The fifty passengers on board and five people in a passing car were fortunate to avoid collision when the train passed through the crossing at around 80 miles per hour. The gates had not been closed before the train passed the level crossing. Dundee District Council (now defunct) had previously postponed planning permission to modernise the gates. They were replaced by the current arrangement of four barriers in 1995, with control transferred to Dundee Signalling Centre. Subsequent restoration of the station saw the removal of the historic footbridge, which now languishes behind the westbound platform, leaving only an underpass for those wishing to cross the line at Gray Street, or walk the short distance to another overbridge, when the barriers are lowered. The footbridge was closed to the public before the crossing was modernised. Service frequencies at the station have varied significantly over the years - prior to 1990, there were regular local trains to Arbroath & Dundee/Perth throughout the day along with a small number of longer-distance workings (see the GB National Rail Timetables 1988/89 Table 242 for details), but a shortage of rolling stock led to the service being significantly cut at the May timetable change that year. For the next twenty years, only a handful of trains (4 per day each way on average) stopped here, but since then there has a gradual increase in provision following a campaign by the local authority & rail user groups (eight additional stops were added in December 2011 \\"Campaign pays off with more train stops at Broughty Ferry\\"The Courier news article, 16 September 2011; Retrieved 18 August 2016). From 2018, an hourly service is planned for this station, and as part of a major timetable upgrade backed by Transport Scotland.\\"‚ÄòRail revolution‚Äô means 200 more services and 20,000 more seats for Scots passengers\\" Transport Scotland press release 15 March 2016, Retrieved 18 August 2016 From December 2018, a roughly hourly service (Monday to Saturday daytime) to Arbroath northbound, and to Edinburgh southbound, was introduced.

This can be face-to-face, on the telephone, or over the internet. Credit cards have become the preferred method of payment in today's market, making a merchant account essential for most businesses. Overview Historically credit card processing services were supplied by banks that were members of the Visa or MasterCard networks. Typically banks both issued credit cards and helped merchants process them, but over time the industry consolidated. Now the industry is dominated by a few large issuers - Elavon, Citibank, Capital One, MBNA / Bank of America, and Chase. Even fewer banks process credit cards. Banks found that it was not within their skillset to convince every small merchant to accept credit cards, and they began to outsource the selling of such services to small companies called ISOs (Independent Sales Organizations). They also found that massive scale helped reduce the cost of processing credit cards, so they began to outsource processing to a few processors including Elavon, TSYS, First Data and MSI. While some merchants buy their credit card processing services directly from a bank, more typically they get their credit card processing services from an ISO, which is responsible for selling the service to the merchant, providing technical support, processing the transaction (authorizing it and submitting it to the Visa or MasterCard network), bearing the risk of chargeback(s), and setting the price of the services. If the ISO is small it might outsource some of those services (for example, providing technical support) to a larger ISO. Except for the few very largest ISOs, the ISO outsources the actual processing to a larger company that focuses solely on processing. While each of the firms discussed above provides merchant accounts and could legitimately be called the merchant account provider, in practice the phrase usually refers to whichever organization has responsibility for directly maintaining the relationship with the merchant. Services =Point of sale (POS) equipment= Point of sale terminals, also known as EPoS ('e' signifying this is an electronic point of sale) may be portable, mobile, fixed, adapted for transactions carried out behind a glass partition, or specially adapted for business-to-business transactions.

Biography Anthony lost his mother at the age of four months, as she died from cancer. He was raised by the help of his aunts and uncles, as his father had 11 siblings. Tony had psychological and learning difficulties when growing up ‚Äì as he could not read or write at the age of 15, but nowadays reads a book every week. Kendall worked as an apprentice building merchant, but was given a break by John Kirkland, who allowed him to set up a company. The company went on to make a turnover of ¬£53,000,000 per annum, allowing Kendall to retire early and concentrate on poker.  Timetable  =Early life= Tony Kendall was always destined for stardom from an early age. After a brief stint in the 40s London Music Hall scene where he made quite a name for himself as a Ventriloquists dummy before progressing to a young drag act in Rex Jameson's turn, that is said to have influenced the great Danny La Rue to take up the wig and dress. LA Rue is quoted as saying in later life that Kendall was \\"an inspiration for all I have done\\". In the late 50s Kendall always one for spotting trends moved away from Music Hall and his departure is seen as the beginning of the end for the dated medium. Kendall then turned his attention to British Railways and a role at the British Transport Commission. He is thought to have met Dr. Richard Beeching at a polo match in the late 50s although the exact details are lost in annuals of the London social scene. Kendall a non-believer in the Railway network aided Beeching in the systematic dismantling of the wider Network. Kendall said on his \\"This is your life\\" appearance that his proudest moments are connected with the dismantling of the Great British Railway Network. Kendall quickly fell out with Beeching as Beeching took all the plaudits for the dismantling of the British Railway Network and Kendalls name was removed from this part of history. He retreated to his property at 165 Oxford Street, where he met struggling accountant Harold Pendleton. As the 50s drew to a close the property on Oxford Street became a \\"House of free music and love\\" and a marquee was erected in the rear of the property. The Marquee housed a small stage and basic speaker set up, decorated in the now iconic Red and White stripes of Kendalls football team Leighton Town. Kendall would invite friends to come and blow horns on a regular basis. The last of great Blues and Jazz artists were often heard trotting out the standards on any horn they could get their hands on. In 1964 Kendall sold the name \\"The Marquee Club\\" to a property in Soho. Many bands and acts played the Marquee over the coming years trying to recapture the glory days of 165 Oxford Street, but the new venue never quite reached the same level of prominence as the original Oxford Street venue. Late 64 and Kendall moved to Bolivia for a couple of summers. Un-confirmed reports that he became a CIA informant, integral to the capture and execution of Che Guevara have never been proven. Kendall never talks of the \\"lost years\\", but he has been heard to mutter \\"death to the Hippies\\" when on his Buckfast retreats on the Isle of Skye in his later years. Kendall to this day also loves a Cuban heel. Also in the sixties, he tried his hand at acting with a cameo role in the film \\"2001, a Space Odyssey\\", where he played one of the apes surrounding the black obelisk at the start of the film. Appalled by the violence in the later \\"enlightened ape\\" scene, he stormed off the set, ending his acting career. The 70s saw Kendall return to the public eye with his now infamous 3 way relationship with Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren. Kendall said to be the inspiration of McLaren's now developing ruthless personality. Westwood is also adamant to this day that Kendall was the true inspiration behind \\"Sex\\" and \\"Too fast to live Too young to die\\". In this period Kendall touched many of the greats who went onto shape the world, and his influence can be seen in all walks of life ‚Äì From the Sex Pistols to Paul Raymond's revue bars whom he was quality control manager for many years. He met and helped Alexander Shulgin's work in drug development and many more \\"doff the cap\\" to the influence Kendall had on their lives around this time. Kendall's biggest contribution to British life came when he met a young Richard Branson in 1972 after Branson had opened his first megastore. Kendall joined \\"team Branson\\" as advisor. He is thought to have steered Branson in new directions and been a \\"rock\\" for Branson. Kendall is thought to have been behind the development of both the Virgin name and brand, and is the mastermind behind Virgin Nigeria and Virgin Cola. Never one to be afraid of putting the boot in, Kendall then steered Branson towards Virgin Trains and again Kendall helped destroy the now rebuilt train network. By the mid 80s Kendall was advising (in his spare time) Rupert Murdoch on how to grow his fledgling TV business. After Branson and Kendall went their separate ways, Kendall devoted all his time into the business plan for Murdoch's TV Empire. Seen by Murdoch's inner circle as \\"Pie in the Sky\\" Kendall went on to Mastermind global domination of the TV world. Sky and Fox TV in the US went on to change the broadcasting landscape for ever. \\"Insightful TV for Insightful people\\" was the tag line in the US. Kendall slowly manufactured a place for himself in front of the cameras on Sky's flagship show, where he can still be seen today ‚Äì displaying his cutting edge fashion and insight into all manner of topics from Ducks to concrete. =2003= He shared his beginning on the poker circuit with Julian Thew and Ian Oldershaw. In 2003 Kendall finished in the money of three tournaments, scooping over $5,000.

The tournament saw 129 entrants and 315 rebuys. He earned $51,014 in prize money throughout the year. Retired from business in April, just decided to enjoy my final years playing poker & chilling. Split with 10-year partner Wendy in October. Began writing articles on The Hendon Mob and for Poker Europa. =2005= 2005 was an even busier year for Kendall, as he cashed in fifteen tournaments.

Although he finished runner-up, he collected $27,895 in prize money. This was his highest earning yet to date, accumulating over $63,000. Was invited to Screen Test as a Presenter for Poker 425, & got the job, the show airing nightly for the rest of the year.

We should have known better than to expect to come here and prevail against the Corporate conglomerate of the Casinos.\\" Phil Ivey revealed that Tony Kendall would be his representation in a similar lawsuit in the US Courts. In appreciation for Kendall's efforts ‚Äì Ivey purportedly gifted Tony a $$65,000 model train set, one of the largest collections in the world and a lifelong passion of Kendall's. ** In the same year, Tony Kendall was awarded the 'Best Contribution to Growing/Promoting UK Poker' at the British Poker Awards. ** At the Federation of European Golf Greenkeepers Association awards held in Crans-Sur-Mer in October 2014 Kendall was awarded a lifetime achievement award for services to the industry such was the amount of time over the years (particularly on courses in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire) he has spent in golf course bunkers. He became an acknowledged world expert in the topography of greens in golf course design in the late 1990s where he spent many a late night surveying the lie of the land. Jack Nicklaus' golf design business engaged Kendall as a bunker consultant for a while in 2005 and this led to suggestions that Kendall may front Sky Sports golf coverage, but this idea was eventually parked away in a multi-padlocked box and buried very deep somewhere only Rupert Murdoch knows as it was felt that the combination of Kendall, and his penchant for stories about aqueducts and Colin Montgomerie, with his penchant for talking about himself, would turn off viewers. =2020= **After a number of years off the radar Kendall returned to significance as one of the key investigators into the ‚Ç¨2bn Wirecard accounting scandal.

The Great Horologion will also contain a list of Saints commemorated throughout the year (with their Troparia and Kontakia), selected propers for Sundays, and moveable Feasts (from the Menaion, Triodion and Pentecostarion), and various Canons and other devotional services. The Great Horologion is most commonly used in Greek-speaking churches. Various editions of the Horologion are usually shorter; still giving the fixed portions of the Daily Office in full, but with the other texts much more abbreviated (all of which are found in full in the other liturgical books). In addition, such texts often also contain Morning and Evening Prayers, the Order of Preparation for Holy Communion, and Prayers to be said after receiving Holy Communion.

The band's name, Sambomaster, refers to the Russian martial art called Sambo. History Lead vocalist and guitarist Takashi Yamaguchi first met drummer Yasufumi Kiuchi a few years back, at a university music club they were both members of. The duo ran into bassist Yoichi Kondo during February 2000, and the three went on to officially form the band now known as Sambomaster. They made their debut at a live house in Tokyo's K≈çenji district and soon followed this up with the self- production of their first single \\"Kick no Oni\\" (Kicking Demons), which they spent nearly a year working on. It was subsequently released in April 2001 as a limited edition of 300 copies. For the first time, listeners outside of a live show were presented with vocalist and frontman Yamaguchi's vocals, which shift between a soft, sandpaper-like melodic voice to all-out screaming madness. Sambomaster's musical style is a blend of punk/classic rock, pop, jazz and rock ballads. The year 2003 saw the release of their very first major-label album, Atarashiki Nihongo Rock no Michi to Hikari and a live performance at the Fuji Rock festival's Rookie GO GO. This led to a huge rise in their success and more widespread notoriety. They have been gathering acclaim from both critics and regular listeners ever since. In 2004 and 2005, Sambomaster released the majority of their hit singles including \\"Seishun Ky≈çs≈çkyoku\\" and \\"Sekai wa Sore wo Ai to Yobundaze\\"; \\"Seishun Ky≈çs≈çkyoku\\" was used as the fifth opening theme to the hit anime series Naruto, and \\"Sekai wa sore Ai to Yobunda ze\\" ended up being the ending theme to the popular Japanese television drama Densha Otoko (and also Nintendo DS game Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2). They were also asked to do the main theme to the movie Koi no Mon, which became the song Tsuki ni Saku Hana no Y≈ç ni Naru no. Recently, their song Hikari no Rock was featured as the single for the film Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion. In March 2009, their song \\"Kimi wo Mamotte, Kimi wo Aishite\\" was announced to be the nineteenth ending song in the hit anime series Bleach. In 2010, they performed the ending theme for the Kuragehime anime, \\"Kimi no Kirei ni Kizuite Okure\\". =Parody= In March 2005, 3 members of the television variety show Haneru no Tobira (\\"You Knock on a Jumping Door!\\") filmed a comedy sketch called \\"Busambomaster\\". The sketch featured a music video parody of the 3 Haneru members pretending to be Sambomaster, playing a Sambomaster-style song called \\"Iitai koto mo iezuni\\" (English: \\"Not even saying what I want to say\\"). However, the 3 Haneru members also made their faces look like caricatures of Yamaguchi, Kiuichi, and Kondo, with features such as enlarged nostrils, buck teeth, and profuse sweating. The lyrics of the song were also made to humiliate lead vocalist Yamaguchi's tendency to scream his thoughts out to fans before and after songs (and sometimes in the middle of songs). Many Sambomaster fans were offended by the song, and after much protesting, Haneru no Tobira eventually apologized on their show.

He is the co- recipient of the 1977 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Annie Hall. He is also known for playing the banjo with Eric Weissberg in the 1960s, and for a series of comical parodies published in The New Yorker. Life and career Brickman was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to American parents Pauline (n√©e Wolin) and Abram Brickman. His family was Jewish. After attending the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, he became a member of Folk act The Tarriers in 1962, recruited by former classmate Eric Weissberg. Following the disbanding of The Tarriers in 1965, Brickman joined The New Journeymen with John Phillips and Michelle Phillips, who later had success with The Mamas & the Papas. He left The New Journeymen to pursue a career as a writer, initially writing for television in the 1960s, including Candid Camera, The Tonight Show, and The Dick Cavett Show. It was during this time that he met Allen, with whom he would collaborate on three completed film screenplays during the 1970s: Sleeper (1973), Annie Hall (1977, which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar), and Manhattan (1979). Brickman directed several of his own scripts in the 1980s, including Simon, Lovesick, and The Manhattan Project, as well as Sister Mary Explains It All, a TV adaptation of the play by Christopher Durang. His script with Allen for Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) had been put aside some years earlier when the project was later revived. With partner Rick Elice, he wrote the book for the Broadway musical Jersey Boys, about 1960s rock 'n' roll group The Four Seasons. The two collaborated again in 2009 to write the book for the musical The Addams Family. Brickman's \\"Who's Who in the Cast,\\" a parody of a Playbill cast list, was published in the July 26, 1976, issue of The New Yorker, and drew so much attention that it was republished in the special theatre issue of May 31, 1993.

It includes Boraginaceae and closely related asterid families. The Boraginales include about 125 genera, 2,700 species and its herbs, shrubs, trees and lianas (vines) have a worldwide distribution.  Taxonomy  = History = The classification of plants now known as Boraginales dates to the Genera plantarum (1789) when Antoine Laurent de Jussieu named a group of plants Boragineae, to include the genus Borago, now the type genus. However, since the first valid description was by Friedrich von Berchtold and Jan Svatopluk Presl (1820), the botanical authority is given as Juss. ex Bercht. & J.Presl, where the ex refers to the prior authority of Jussieu. Lindley (1853) changed the name to the modern Boraginaceae. Jussieu divided the Boragineae into five groups. Since then Boraginaceae has been treated either as a large family with several subfamilies, or as a smaller family with several closely related families. The family had been included in a number of higher order taxa, but in 1926 Hutchinson erected a new order, Boraginales, to include the Boraginaceae. Although Boraginales was included in a number of taxonomic classifications including Dahlgren (1980), Takhtajan (1997) and Kubitzki (2016) as an order, it was not recognized in either of two major systems, the Cronquist system and the APG system. In the Cronquist system, Boraginaceae (including Cordiaceae, Ehretiaceae, and Heliotropiaceae) and Lennoaceae were placed in the order Lamiales, while the related Hydrophyllaceae was placed in Solanales. The APG system took a broad view of Boraginaceae (Boraginaceae s.l.), including within it the traditionally recognized families Hydrophyllaceae and Lennoaceae based on recent molecular phylogenies that show that Boraginaceae, as traditionally defined, is paraphyletic over these two families. APG III included Boraginaceae in the Euasterid I (lamiid) clade but this family was otherwise unplaced; its precise relationship to other families in the Euasterid I group remained unclear. In a phylogenetic study of DNA sequences of selected genes, Boraginales was resolved as sister to Lamiales sensu APG, but that result had only 65% maximum likelihood bootstrap support. In the 2016 APG IV system Boraginales is an order with only one family Boraginaceae, which includes the former family Codonaceae. At the time of the APG IV consensus there was insufficient support to further divide this monophyletic group further. (for a complete discussion of the history of the taxonomy of Boraginales, see ) = Boraginales Working Group = Following the publication of APG IV, a collaborative group along similar lines to the APG, the Boraginales Working Group, was formed to further elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the Boragnaceae s.l.. As a result it has been split into eleven families, including: Boraginaceae s.s. or s.str., Cordiaceae, Ehretiaceae, Heliotropiaceae, and Hydrophyllaceae. A number of these were monogeneric. Boraginaceae is hard to characterize morphologically if it includes the genera Codon and Wellstedia. Codon was long regarded as an unusual member of Hydrophyllaceae, but in 1998, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that it is closer to Boraginaceae, and both Codon and Wellstedia have been allocated to their own families, Codonaceae and Wellstediaceae. The achlorophyllous holoparasites Lennoa and Pholisma were once regarded as a family, Lennoaceae, but it is now known that they form a clade that is nested within Ehretiaceae. Some studies have indicated that Hydrophyllaceae is paraphyletic if the tribe Nameae is included within it, but further studies will be needed to resolve this issue. The inclusion of the genus Hoplestigma in Boraginales was occasionally doubted until it was strongly confirmed in a cladistic study in 2014. Hoplestigma is the closest relative of Cordiaceae and it has been recommended that the latter be expanded to include it. Hydrolea was thought to belong in Hydrophyllaceae for more than a century after it was placed there by Asa Gray, but it is now known to belong in the order Solanales as sister to Sphenoclea. Pteleocarpa was long regarded as an anomaly, and was usually placed in Boraginales, but with considerable doubt. The molecular evidence strongly supports it as sister to Gelsemiaceae, and that family has been expanded to include it.  References   Bibliography    * Diane, N., H. F√∂rther, and H. H. Hilger. 2002.

The flag of India was hoisted by Jawaharlal Nehru on 31 December 1929 on the banks of Ravi river, in Lahore, modern-day Pakistan. The Congress asked the people of India to observe 26th of January as Independence Day (see Legacy). The flag of India was hoisted publicly across India by Congress volunteers, nationalists and the public. Background Before 1930, Indian political parties had openly embraced the goal of political independence from the United Kingdom. The All India Home Rule League had been advocating Home Rule for India: dominion status within the British Empire, as granted to Australia, Canada, the Irish Free State, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa. The All India Muslim League favoured dominion status as well, and opposed calls for outright Indian independence. The Indian Liberal Party, by far the most pro-British party, explicitly opposed India's independence and even dominion status if it weakened India's links with the British Empire. The Indian National Congress, the largest Indian political party of the time, was at the head of the national debate. Congress leader and famous poet Hasrat Mohani was the first activist to demand complete independence (Poorna Swaraj) from the British in 1921 from an All-India Congress Forum. Veteran Congress leaders such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Sri Aurobindo and Bipin Chandra Pal had also advocated explicit Indian independence from the Empire. Following the 1919 Amritsar Massacre, there was considerable public outrage against British rule. Europeans, (civilians and officials) were targets and victims of violence across India. In 1920, Gandhi and the Congress committed themselves to Swaraj, described as political and spiritual independence. At the time, Gandhi described this as the basic demand of all Indians; he specifically said that the question of whether India would remain within the Empire or leave it completely would be answered by the behaviour and response of the British. Between 1920 and 1922, Mahatma Gandhi led the Non-Cooperation movement: nationwide civil disobedience to oppose the Rowlatt Acts and the exclusion of Indians from the government, and the denial of political and civil freedoms. Simon commission and the Nehru report In 1928, the British government further outraged people across India by appointing a seven-man, all-European committee led by Sir John Simon, called the Simon Commission to deliberate on constitutional and political reforms for India. Indian political parties were neither consulted nor asked to involve themselves in the process. Upon arrival in India, Chairman Sir John Simon and other commission members were met with angry public demonstrations, which followed them everywhere. The death of a prominent Indian leader, Lala Lajpat Rai, from severe beatings by British police officials further outraged the Indian public. The Congress appointed an all-Indian commission to propose constitutional reforms for India. Members of other Indian political parties joined the commission led by Congress President Motilal Nehru. The Nehru Report demanded that India be granted self-government under the dominion status within the Empire. While most other Indian political parties supported the Nehru commission's work, it was opposed by the Indian Liberal Party and the All India Muslim League. The British ignored the commission, its report and refused to introduce political reform. Dominion or republic? The Nehru Report was also controversial within Congress. Younger nationalist leaders like Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanded that Congress resolve to make a complete and explicit break from all ties with the British. Jawaharlal Nehru had been influenced by the idea of Bhagat Singh (\\"total independence\\"), which Singh had introduced a resolution demanding in 1927, which was rejected because of Gandhi's opposition.Rajmohan Gandhi, Patel: A Life, p. 171, ASIN: B0006EYQ0A Now Bose and Nehru opposed dominion status, which would retain the Monarch of the United Kingdom as the constitutional head of state of India (although in the separate capacity as King of India), and preserve political powers for the British Parliament in Indian constitutional affairs. They were supported in their stand by a large number of rank-and-file Congressmen. In December 1928, Congress session was held in Kolkata and Mohandas Gandhi proposed a resolution that called for the British to grant dominion status to India within two years. After some time Gandhi brokered a further compromise by reducing the time given from two years to one. Jawaharlal Nehru voted for the new resolution, while Subhash Bose told his supporters that he would not oppose the resolution, and abstained from voting himself. The All India Congress Committee voted 118 to 45 in its favour (the 45 votes came from supporters of a complete break from the British). However, when Bose introduced an amendment during the open session of Congress that sought a complete break with the British, Gandhi admonished the move: > You may take the name of independence on your lips but all your muttering > will be an empty formula if there is no honour behind it. If you are not > prepared to stand by your words, where will independence be?D. G. Tendulkar, > Mahatma, Bombay, 1951, p. 441 The amendment was rejected, by 1350 to 973, and the resolution was fully adopted. On 31 October 1929, the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin announced that the government would meet with Indian representatives in London for a Round Table Conference. To facilitate Indian participation, Irwin met with Mohandas Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and out-going Congress President Motilal Nehru to discuss the meeting. Gandhi asked Irwin if the conference would proceed on the basis of dominion status and Irwin said he could not assure that, resulting in the end of the meeting.R. Gandhi, Patel: A Life, p. 185 The declaration As a result of the denial of reforms and political rights, and the persistent ignorance of Indian political parties, the Indian National Congress grew increasingly cohesive ‚Äì unified in the desire to out the British from India completely. A very large number of Congress volunteers and delegates, members of other political parties and an especially large public gathering attended the session convened in Lahore. Despite the bitterly cold weather, Pattabhi Sitaramayya records that: > The heat of passion and excitement, the resentment at the failure of > negotiation, the flushing of faces on hearing the war drums ‚Äì oh, it was all > in marked contrast to the weather.Pattabhi Sitaramayya, The History of the > Congress, Allahabad, 1935, p. 600 Jawaharlal Nehru was elected President and veteran leaders like Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel returned to the Congress Working Committee. They approved a declaration of independence, which stated: > The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of > their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and > has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually.... > Therefore...India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraj > or complete independence. At midnight on New Year's Eve, President Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon the banks of the Ravi in Lahore, which later became part of Pakistan. A pledge of independence was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The massive gathering of public attending the ceremony were asked if they agreed with it, and the vast majority of people were witnessed to raise their hands in approval. One hundred seventy-two Indian members of central and provincial legislatures resigned in support of the resolution and in accordance with Indian public sentiment. The Declaration of Independence was officially promulgated on 26 January 1930. Gandhi and other Indian leaders would immediately begin the planning of a massive national non-violence would encourage the common people not to attack Britishers even if they attacked them. Subsequently, the Salt Satyagraha was initiated by Mahatma Gandhi on 12 March 1930 and what followed gave impetus to the Indian independence movement and sparked off the nationwide Non- Cooperation Movement. The resolution was a short 750-word document; it does not have a legal/constitutional structure ‚Äì instead, it reads more like a manifesto. The document called for severing ties with the British and claimed ‚ÄòPurna Swaraj‚Äô or completes independence. It indicted British rule and succinctly articulated the resulting economic, political and cultural injustice inflicted on Indians. The document spoke on behalf of Indians and made its intention of launching the civil disobedience movement clear. Authorship There is some dispute as to who drafted the text of the declaration. Gandhi directly claimed authorship in 1940, while other sources either cite Nehru as a major editor or attribute it to Nehru outright. Legacy The Congress regularly observed 26 January as the Independence Day of India ‚Äì commemorating those who campaigned for Indian independence. In 1947, the British agreed to transfer power and political finesse to India, and 15 August became the official Independence Day. However, the new Constitution of India, as drafted and approved by the Constituent Assembly, was mandated to take effect on 26 January 1950, to commemorate the 1930 declaration. On that day in 1950, India became a republic. 26 January is now celebrated as Republic Day of India every year.

Currently, the service is available in Chile, Per√∫, Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela and Argentina. In Spain, this service merged with the satellite platform Canal+, resulting in a new platform called Movistar+.  History  The service was started as a commercial test pilot in the city of Alicante in 2001 and later extended to some major cities such as Madrid and Barcelona in April 2004. In 2013, Movistar Imagenio was rebranded to Movistar TV. As of March 2006, coverage has yet reached the whole of Spain. Major cities and province capitals are covered, but not rural areas or minor cities. It is possible for users to check on-line if the service is available for their phone line on the Movistar website . The channel line-up includes some international English-language channels, such as CNN International and BBC World News. Additionally for certain channels, Movistar TV allows the viewer to switch instantly from the dubbed Spanish versions of foreign-made programs to the original-language version. This facility is available for many digital channels such as TCM, Calle 13, FOX and Disney Channel but not for national terrestrial/digital channels such as TVE, Antena3 or Telecinco.  Technology  The Movistar TV (then called Imagenio) platform is powered by Alcatel- Lucent (formerly Lucent Technologies) since 2006. Previously, Imagenio platform was an in-house development held by Telef√≥nica I+D (the R&D; branch of Telef√≥nica). In 2006, C√©sar Alierta (CEO of Telef√≥nica) signed an agreement with Patricia Russo (CEO of Lucent Technologies at that time) for the Imagenio base-technology transfer. Since November 2007, Imagenio incorporated new features that allow the customer to have a truly TV 'a la carte': the services \\"Past TV,\\" \\"Shift TV,\\" \\"Rewind TV\\" and \\"Recorder Staff. \\" These services are made possible by a HD TV (High Definition Television) decoder with a hard drive of 160 GB, similar to TiVo. \\"Past TV\\" is an exclusive service of Movistar TV, which makes it possible to access content broadcast up to seven days before, has been officially recorded by Imagenio without the client having to do anything. \\"Shift TV\\" is an option that allows users to stop live broadcast of any program from any channel, and then continue viewing.

She later had a career as an actress in movies, most prominently in TNT Jackson, in which she played the title character, and supporting roles in Mean Streets and The Klansman, as well as occasional TV appearances. Biography Bell grew up in Houston, Texas, along with three younger sisters and attended Texas Southern University, majoring in business administration. Jean was the first African American woman to participate in the Miss Texas Pageant, which is part of the Miss Universe competition. She aspired to professional bowling or acting. When she appeared in the October 1969 issue of Playboy, Bell was only the second African-American woman to grace the centerfold (the first was Jennifer Jackson, in March 1965). Her centerfold was photographed by Don Klumpp. A few months later, Bell became the first black person to appear on the magazine's cover. Darine Stern, who is often erroneously credited with this distinction, was actually the first black woman to appear on the cover of Playboy on her own, in the October 1971 issue. Bell was featured with four other playmates in the January 1970 cover of the magazine. After Bell's appearance in Playboy, she enjoyed a brief acting career, working on such films as Mean Streets and The Klansman (for some roles she was credited as Jeanne Bell). Her most notable role was the title character in 1975's TNT Jackson. Bell dated Richard Burton and helped him quit drinking and as a result was credited with getting him back together with Elizabeth Taylor afterwards. An Earl Wilson column in September 1975 revealed Bell's three-month friendship with the actor. She visited Burton at his villa in C√©ligny, Switzerland, during her effort to help him \\"dry out\\". With his assistance Bell acquired a place of her own in Geneva, Switzerland. Around that time, Bell worked at Splendors Gentlemen's club in Houston and went by \\"Bunny\\". Bell posed nude again for Playboy in the December 1979 pictorial \\"Playmates Forever!\\", and subsequently disappeared from public life. In 1986 she married businessman Gary Judis after an eight-year courtship.Actress Jeannie Bell, Multi-Millionaire Wed, Jet, November 24, 1986, p. 54  Film and television work  =Films= * The Choirboys (1977) ....

The label OKNO ≈ªYCIA means \\"Window of Life\\" A baby hatch or baby box is a place where people (typically mothers) can bring babies, usually newborn, and abandon them anonymously in a safe place to be found and cared for. This kind of arrangement was common in the Middle Ages and in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the device was known as a foundling wheel. Foundling wheels were taken out of use in the late 19th century but a modern form, the baby hatch, began to be introduced again from 1952 and since 2000 has come into use in many countries, notably in Germany, where there are around 100 hatches and in Pakistan where there are more than 300 as of 2006. The hatch is known in German-speaking countries as a Babyklappe (baby hatch or flap), Babyfenster (baby window) or Babywiege (baby cradle);The 'baby box' returns to Europe, BBC News, 26 June 2012 in Italian as Culla per la vita (life cradle); in Sicilian as la ruota (the wheel); in Japanese as ; in Mandarin Chinese as Â©¥ÂÑøÂÆâÂÖ®Â≤õ () and in Polish as Okno ≈ºycia (window of life) and in South Africa originally known as \\"the hole in the wall\\" by Door of Hope Children's Mission. The hatches are usually in hospitals, social centres, or churches, and consist of a door or flap in an outside wall which opens onto a soft bed, heated or at least insulated. Sensors in the bed nowadays alert carers when a baby has been put in it so that they can come and take care of the child. In Germany, babies are first looked after for eight weeks during which the mother can return and claim her child without any legal repercussions. If this does not happen, after eight weeks the child is put up for adoption. History Foundling wheel at the \\"Ospedale Santo Spirito\\" in Rome Baby hatches have existed in one form or another for centuries. The system was quite common in medieval times. From 1198 the first foundling wheels (ruota dei trovatelli) were used in Italy; Pope Innocent III decreed that these should be installed in homes for foundlings so that women could leave their child in secret instead of killing them, a practice clearly evident from the numerous drowned infants found in the Tiber River. A foundling wheel was a cylinder set upright in the outside wall of the building, rather like a revolving door. Mothers placed the child in the cylinder, turned it around so that the baby was inside the church, and then rang a bell to alert caretakers. One example of this type which can still be seen today is in the Santo Spirito hospital at the Vatican City; this wheel was installed in medieval times and used until the 19th century. Another foundling wheel dating to at least 1601 is on display for visitors to Naples' Church of the Annunciata. In Hamburg, Germany, a Dutch merchant set up a wheel (Drehladen) in an orphanage in 1709. It closed after only five years in 1714 as the number of babies left there was too high for the orphanage to cope with financially. Other wheels are known to have existed in Kassel (1764) and Mainz (1811). Foundling wheel at the \\"Ospedale degli Innocenti\\" in Florence In France, foundling wheels (tours d'abandon, abandonment wheel) were introduced by Saint Vincent de Paul who built the first foundling home in 1638 in Paris. Foundling wheels were legalised in an imperial decree of January 19, 1811, and at their height, there were 251 in France, according to author Anne Martin- Fugier. They were in hospitals such as the H√¥pital des Enfants-Trouv√©s (Hospital for Foundling Children) in Paris. However, the number of children left there rose into the tens of thousands per year, as a result of the desperate economic situation at the time, and in 1863 they were closed down and replaced by \\"admissions offices\\" where mothers could give up their child anonymously but could also receive advice. The tours d'abandon were officially abolished in law of June 27, 1904. Today in France, women are allowed to give birth anonymously in hospitals (accouchement sous X) and leave their baby there. In Brazil and Portugal, foundling wheels (roda dos expostos/enjeitados, literally \\"wheel for exposed/rejected ones\\") were also used after Queen Maria I proclaimed on May 24, 1783, that all towns should have a foundling hospital. One example was the wheel installed at the Santa Casa de Misericordia hospital in S√£o Paulo on July 2, 1825. This was taken out of use on June 5, 1949, declared incompatible with the modern social system after five years' debate. A Brazilian film on this subject, Roda Dos Expostos, directed by Maria Em√≠lia de Azevedo, won an award for \\"Best Photography\\" at the Festival de Gramado in 2001. Foundling Hospital in London In Britain and Ireland, foundlings were brought up in orphanages financed by the Poor Tax. The home for foundlings in London was established in 1741; in Dublin the Foundling Hospital and Workhouse installed a foundling wheel in 1730, as this excerpt from the Minute Book of the Court of Governors of that year shows: :\\"Hu (Boulter) Armach, Primate of All-Ireland, being in the chair, ordered that a turning-wheel, or convenience for taking in children, be provided near the gate of the workhouse; that at any time, by day or by night, a child may be layd in it, to be taken in by the officers of the said house.\\" The foundling wheel in Dublin was taken out of use in 1826 when the Dublin hospital was closed because of the high death rate of children there. Modern examples Door of Hope Children's Mission, Johannesburg The first modern baby hatch was in South Africa in July 1999 and was installed by Door of Hope Children's Mission (Hole in the Wall) at a small mission church in Berea in Johannesburg. In 1999 the pastor, Cheryl Allen, and deacons learned with deep distress that a high number of newly born infants were abandoned. Pastor Allen realised that many of those desperate women and girls may well have acted differently if there had been an alternative. The church made a hole in their wall and a \\"baby bin\\" was installed allowing for mothers to leave their babies any time, day or night. The moment a baby is placed in the \\"baby bin\\" care workers on duty receive an electronic signal alerting them. The baby is taken in and the anonymity of the \\"donor\\" ensured. Baby M was the first baby that came through the \\"baby bin\\", arriving on 3 October 1999. To date (2013), Door of Hope has received over 1300 babies. 148 have come through the \\"baby bin\\" but most come from hospitals, police or community members and some babies have even been brought personally by the mothers. The second modern baby hatch in Germany was installed in the Altona district of Hamburg on 11 April 2000, after a series of cases in 1999 where children were abandoned and found dead from exposure. It consisted of a warm bed in which the child could be placed from outside the building. After a short delay to allow the person who left the child to leave anonymously, a silent alarm was set off which alerted staff. By 2010, 38 babies had been left in the \\"Findelbaby\\" baby hatch in Hamburg, 14 of whom were later reclaimed by their mothers. The Edhi Foundation in Pakistan offers a similar system. Reasons for using baby hatches Baby hatch in Rabat, Malta One reason many babies have been abandoned, especially in the past, was that they were born out of wedlock. Today, baby hatches are more often intended to be used by mothers who are unable to cope with looking after their own child and do not wish to divulge their identity. In some countries, it is not legal for mothers to give birth anonymously in a hospital, and the baby hatch is the only way they can safely and secretly leave their child to be cared for by others. In IndiaCradles plan for unwanted girls BBC News, 18 February 2007 and Pakistan, the purpose of baby hatches is mainly to provide an alternative to female infanticide, which occurs due to socio-economic factors including the high cost of dowries. Legal aspects Some legal problems with baby hatches are connected to children's right to know their own identity, as guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child's Article 8. =Austria= In Austria, the law treats babies found in baby hatches as foundlings. The local social services office for children and young people (Jugendwohlfahrt) takes care of the child for the first six months and then it is given up for adoption. Women have had the right to give birth anonymously since 2001. =Czech Republic= In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Social Affairs confirmed in 2006 that baby hatches are legal under Czech law. In contradiction to this, in March 2006, Colonel Anna Piskova, a police officer, said on Czech television that the police would look for the mothers of abandoned children. The head of the Czech baby hatch organization Statim, Ludvik Hess, complained about this statement and was officially supported by the Save the Children Foundation. , there are 76 baby hatches in the country, mostly in major cities. So far, they have helped to save 187 children.Babybox nƒõkdo otev≈ôel a zav≈ôel, holƒçiƒçku pak dvƒõ ≈æeny p≈ôedaly sestr√°m The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has questioned the legality of baby boxes, criticizing the high number of children's group homes and claiming the boxes violate children's rights.Committee on the Rights of the Child reviews report of the Czech Republic, United Nations, 31 May 2011Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations: Czech Republic, CRC/C/CZE/CO/3-4, Committee on the Rights of the Child, Fifty-seventh session, 30 May ‚Äì 17 June 2011 (4 August 2011) Czech internet news server novinky.cz has reported that United Nations wants to ban baby hatches in the Czech Republic. =France= In France, the Vichy government adopted the Legislative Decree of 2 September 1941 on the Protection of Births allowing children to be born anonymously. This law, somewhat modified, became the modern right to anonymous birth (accouchement sous X) set down in the French Social Action and Families Code (Art. 222-6). It covers children up to one year of age. In 2003, the European Court of Human Rights upheld this law,odi√®vre ‚Äì 42326jnv.gc 13022003e ruling that it did not violate the European Convention on Human Rights. =Germany= In Germany, the baby hatch system only just borders on the legal; normally a mother who abandons her child is committing a criminal act. However, according to the German social laws, parents are allowed to leave their child in the charge of a third party for up to eight weeks, for example if the parents need to go into hospital. After eight weeks, however, the youth welfare office must be called in. German law considers babies left in the baby hatch as if they have been left in the charge of a third party. This loophole is extremely controversial as there have been some cases in Germany where the baby hatches have been used to abandon disabled children or babies already three months old. Several attempts have been made to clear up the legal basis for baby hatches and how to treat the children left in them, but as yet the situation is still not clearly regulated. =Japan= In Japan, abandoning a baby is normally punished with up to five years in prison. In 2006 officials at Jikei Hospital applied to Kumamoto Prefecture government, Kumamoto city and other offices before opening a baby hatch were told that it would not count as abandonment, as the baby is under the hospital's protection. However, the Japanese ministry of health, labour and welfare would not comment on the issue, apart from saying that there was no precedent. =Malta= * =Belgium= In Belgium the legal framework is absent, and abandoning babies is illegal, but in practice the babies are placed in foster care and become available for adoption after a few months. The Belgium hatch operates in a legal vacuum under Belgian law. Even spreading the information is considered \\"Promoting child abandonment\\" and those responsible for the existence of the baby Hatch (babyschuif) sensu stricto remain punishable under Belgium law. =Russia= Since 2011, ten baby hatches or so-called baby boxes have come into use in Russia. In less than one year of activity, the boxes helped to save three children. The charity fund The Cradle of Hope (–ö–æ–ª—ã–±–µ–ª—å –Ω–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥—ã, www.babyboxrf.ru) established in Perm is the main project organizer. Along with installing and setting up baby hatches, the organization works to prevent infanticide, and helps families cope with crisis situations. The baby hatches are installed in hospitals and run by the wardship and guardianship authority. The law treats babies found in baby boxes as foundlings, who are raised by the State while going through the legal process of adoption. Senator Elena Mizulina proposed a law to ban baby boxes. In September 2016 it was approved by the Russian government stating that the special places for anonymous abandoning the newborns violate the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\\"–ú–∏–∑—É–ª–∏–Ω–∞ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–∏–ª–∞ –æ–± –æ–¥–æ–±—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –∑–∞–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –±—ç–±–∏-–±–æ–∫—Å—ã\\", lenta.ru, September 28, 2016 =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom there are no baby hatches, as they are illegal: under section 27 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 the law states that any mother who abandons a child less than two years of age is a criminal and can face up to five years' imprisonment. In practice, such prosecutions are extremely rare and would only occur if the circumstances of child abandonment showed actual malice, i.e. appeared deliberately intended to result in the death of the child. A mother who wishes to have her newborn baby adopted can do so. Counseling is designed to ensure that giving up the baby is her genuine, irrevocable wish. =Latvia= In Latvia, unless the baby has been reported as missing, the law treats the babies as foundlings. All baby hatches are located within a hospital's premises. After a baby is left in a baby hatch, the police and custody court are informed about the case and the baby is given a health evaluation and is inspected for signs of abuse. The police during a two day long process find out if the child has been reported as missing, after that the baby is given the status of a foundling and can be put up for adoption. If the birth parents want to recover a child, they have the option to do so until the child has been officially adopted. The birth parents must prove their parentage by taking a DNA test, which they must pay for themselves. After that custody court reviews the parent's reasons for abandonment and decide whether to allow the parents guardianship of the child. As of May 2018, 5 out of 47 babies left in the baby hatch were returned to their birth parents. International situation *Austria ‚Äì In 2005, six towns had them. *Australia ‚Äì There have been various discussions regarding establishing baby hatches. *Belgium ‚Äì The association Moeders voor Moeders (\\"Mothers for mothers\\") set up the first babyschuif in the Borgerhout district of Antwerp in 2000. It is known as Moeder Mozes Mandje ‚Äì \\"mothers' Moses basket\\" located in the \\"Helmstraat\\". Since its inception, 6 unknown babies were found in the baby hatch in Borgerhout. Another baby (Marieke) was saved after the mother called the emergency telephone while in labor. These have been given \\"De Kleine\\" (roughly translated \\"the small child\\") as their last name. During the winter 2016-2017, a tenth baby was found in the \\"babyschuif\\". *Canada ‚Äì In May 2010, St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver announced the intention to open Canada's first \\"angel's cradle\\".Hospital to open drop-off for abandoned babies, CBC News, April 29, 2010 By 2014, two more have been introduced in Edmonton, CBC News, May 6, 2013 and one has been proposed for Toronto., Toronto Star, June 7, 2013 *Czech Republic ‚Äì The first baby hatch was set up in July 2005 in Prague by Babybox ‚Äì Statim. In March 2006, three children had been left there. In December 2007, there were 5 \\"Babyboxes\\" in the republic: Prague-Hloubƒõt√≠n, Brno, Olomouc, Kada≈à and Zl√≠n, and the next were planned in Pelh≈ôimov, √öst√≠ nad Orlic√≠, Mlad√° Boleslav and Sokolov in 2008. From 2005‚Äì2007, ten infants were put in baby-boxes, seven of them in Prague. Some of them returned to their mother or were inserted with full documentation. there were 47, and 62 children had already been left there with one baby box being used 13 times.V Mƒõln√≠ku zaƒçal fungovat jubilejn√≠ t≈ôic√°t√Ω babybox In years 2005‚Äì2019 there have been 76 babyboxes, into which 187 children were put. *Germany ‚Äì Baby hatches have been used again since 2000; in 2005 there were more than 80 baby hatches in towns all across the country. *Hungary ‚Äì Around a dozen baby hatches, usually run by hospitals. The first opened in 1996 in the Schopf- Merei Agost hospital in Budapest. *India ‚Äì In Tamil Nadu state, a baby hatch was set up in 1994 by the then Chief Minister, J. Jayalalithaa, to prevent female infanticide. This kind of baby is called Thottil Kuzhanthai (cradle baby), raised by the state and entitled to free education. In 2002 an \\"e-cradle\\" scheme was also introduced in southern India after an abandoned newborn baby was torn apart by dogs in the street near Trivandrum Medical College.Hindustan Times: Kerala e-cradle gets 100th child, a girl *Italy ‚Äì About 8 hatches, set up by the \\"Movement for Life\\". In December 2006 a modern hatch was installed at the Policlinico Casilino in Rome and in February 2007 it received its first abandoned child. There are also plans to install one at the Santo Spirito hospital at the Vatican City, the home of one of the original foundling wheels. *Japan ‚Äì in 2006 the Jikei Hospital in Kumamoto Prefecture announced it was setting up a \\"storks' cradle\\" to try to reduce the number of abandoned babies and abortions. , a total of 51 babies had been accepted, and this system has been under the strict guidance of a special committee which pointed out that the acceptance of anonymous babies might reduce the moral philosophy of people. 125 babies had been left at the baby hatch . *Latvia - the first glƒÅbƒìjsilƒ´te (\\"savior manger\\") was set up in 2009 in Riga within the Childrens Clinical University Hospital's territory. Since then, seven more hatches were set up in Latvia's biggest towns. As of August 2019, 47 children have been left within a baby hatch, of which five have been reclaimed by their birth parents. *Netherlands ‚Äì In 2003 plans to open a babyluik in Amsterdam did not go ahead after heavy protest. State Secretary for Health Cl√©mence Ross suggested that baby hatches were illegal. In years since, the Beschermde Wieg Foundation opened abandoned children rooms in the cities of Groningen, Middelburg, Oudenbosch, Papendrecht, Rotterdam and Zwolle. Women in need can leave their babies anonymously. In 2017 a room in Amsterdam is planned. *Pakistan ‚Äì The Edhi Foundation has around 300 centres which offer a jhoola service which is said to have saved over 16,000 lives; the jhoola is a white metal hanging cradle with a mattress, where the baby can be left anonymously outside the centre. A bell can be rung, and staff also check the cradle once an hour. *Philippines ‚Äì The Hospicio de San Jose in Manila, founded in 1810 and run by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, has a \\"turning cradle\\" marked \\"Abandoned Babies Received Here\\". *Malaysia - The first \\"Baby Hatch\\" was launched by a non-profit NGO, OrphanCare Foundation in 2010. By end of 2016 OrphanCare had saved over 200 babies and has two more baby hatches in state of Kedah and Johor. In 2015 OrphanCare signed MoC with KPJ Healthcare to manage the adoption of babies placed in baby hatches in 8 of KPJ Hospitals in major cities in Peninsular Malaysia. KPJ also have a baby hatch each in Sabah and Sarawak. *Poland ‚Äì In 2012, forty-seven towns had them. *South Africa ‚Äì The non-profit organisation \\"Door Of Hope Children's Mission\\" set up a \\"hole in the wall\\" in July 1999 at the Mission Church in Johannesburg. By March 2013 around 148 babies came through the hole in the wall but over 1300 babies have come through their doors. *South Korea ‚Äì Pastor Lee Jong-rak operates a \\"baby box\\" in his church in southwest Seoul. Before the Special Adoption Law was passed in August 2012, Mr. Lee says the baby box received an average of about two newborns per month, but that number has risen to about 19. *Switzerland ‚Äì There are two baby hatches operating in Switzerland, one at the Einsiedeln hospital since 2001 and another one at the Davos hospital since 2012. *United States ‚Äì Two baby hatches started operating in the state of Indiana in 2016. Baby hatches as such are not known elsewhere in the United States; however, all 50 states have introduced \\"safe-haven laws\\" since Texas began on September 1, 1999. These allow parents to legally give up their newborn child (younger than 72 hours) anonymously to certain places known as \\"safe havens\\", such as fire stations, police stations, and hospitals. The laws have different names in different states, e.g. California's Safely Surrendered Baby LawSafely Surrendered Baby Law, Los Angeles County and some have different age limits, e.g. Nebraska's safe-haven law as originally written had no age limit, allowing all children under 18 years of age to be abandoned; this was amended on November 2008.Neb.

Chappelle at the National Inventors Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2007 Emmett W. Chappelle (October 24, 1925 ‚Äì October 14, 2019) was an American scientist who made valuable contributions in the fields of medicine, philanthropy, food science, and astrochemistry. His achievements led to his induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his work on Bio- luminescence, in 2007. Being honored as one of the 100 most distinguished African American scientists of the 20th Century, he was also one of the members of the American Chemical Society, the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the American Society of Photobiology, the American Society of Microbiology, and the American Society of Black Chemists.  Early life  In 1925, Emmett Chappelle was born in Phoenix, Arizona to his parents, Viola White Chappelle and Isom Chappelle, who grew cotton and raised cattle on their farm. Born into segregation, Chappelle was required to attend the segregated Phoenix Union Colored High School in Phoenix, where he was the top graduate of his senior class of 25 students. Upon graduation, in 1942, Emmett enlisted in the army where he was able to take some engineering courses before being assigned to the 92nd Infantry Division that was stationed in Italy. During his time in the service, he suffered two non-fatal wounds in action. After his return from Italy in 1946, he attended Phoenix College where he studied electrical engineering and received an A.A. degree before he redirected his focus and career towards the sciences. Career and important discoveries In 1950, Chappelle received a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, then served as an instructor of biochemistry at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1950 to 1953, without graduate training. He then left Tennessee to continue his education at the University of Washington where he received his master's degree, also in Biochemistry. From 1955 to 1958, he worked as a research associate at Stanford University where he was also appointed as a scientist and biochemist for the Research Institute of Advanced Studies until 1963. Then, in 1958, Chappelle joined the Research Institute in Baltimore, a division of the Martin Marietta Corporation that was famous for designing airplanes and spacecraft. There, Chappelle made a major discovery that has largely contributed to the knowledge of bacteria, cyanobacteria, and other single-celled organisms around the world. He discovered that even single- celled organisms such as algae, are photosynthetic, meaning they are able to convert carbon dioxide to sugar and water into oxygen. The ability to photosynthesize is characteristic of all plants that is the opposite process of cellular respiration, which all organisms use to create the energy needed for life. Algal photosynthesis has been essential to allowing astronauts to have a constantly renewing source of oxygen. This knowledge was not only beneficial to astronauts because it allowed scientists to develop a method for creating clean oxygen for astronauts in space, but it also provided them with a safe food source (the algae itself) that is capable of reproducing in space. In 1963, Chappelle went to work at Hazelton Laboratories, now known as Covance Inc., as a biochemist but later joined the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as an exobiologist and astrochemist, in 1966. As an exobiologist and astrochemist of NASA, someone who focuses towards the search for extraterrestrial life and studies the chemistry of astronomical objects, he worked on the Viking Spacecraft and helped develop instruments to collect and scrape soil from the surface of Mars. However, he was most well known for his work on biolumenescence. In 1977 he was moved to the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, as a remote sensing scientist, studying natural systems to improve environmental management. Some of Chappelle's most interesting work was in the area of luminescence, which is light without heat. While designing instruments for the Mars Viking spacecraft, he became interested in bio luminescence, which is warm light produced by living organisms. Chappelle developed a method using two chemicals, luciferase and luciferin, from fireflies which give off light when mixed with ATP (adenosine triphosphate), an energy storage compound found in all living cells, to detect the presence of ATP. This method for ATP detection can be used to detect life on other planets as well as microbiological organisms. Chappelle also proved that the number of bacteria in water can be measured by the amount of light given off by that bacteria. This discovery allowed scientists and doctors to detect small amounts of bacteria in places such as urine, in order to detect an onset of a bacterial infection. Additionally, he developed a method for determining vegetation health by using laser-induced fluorescence to measure the amount of photosynthesis occurring in crops, allowing scientists to detect plant stress, determine growth rates, water conditions, and harvest timing. Chappelle retired from NASA in 2001, at the age of 76. He died in Baltimore, Maryland on October 14, 2019, at the age of 93.  Patents  # July 27, 1976: Method of detecting and counting bacteria #* An improved method is provided for determining bacterial levels, especially in samples of aqueous physiological fluids, which method depends on the quantitative determination of bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the presence of non-bacterial ATP. The bacterial ATP is released by cell rupture and is measured by an enzymatic bioluminescent assay. A concentration technique is included to make the method more sensitive. It is particularly useful where the fluid to be measured contains an unknown or low bacteria count. # March 29, 1977: Application of luciferase assay for ATP to antimicrobial drug susceptibility #* The susceptibility of bacteria, particularly those derived from body fluids, to antimicrobial agents is determined in terms of an ATP index measured by culturing a bacterium in a growth medium, assaying the amount of ATP in a sample of the cultured bacterium by measuring the amount of luminescent light emitted when the bacterial ATP is reacted with a luciferase- luciferin mixture, subjecting the sample of the cultured bacterium to an antibiotic agent and assaying the amount of bacterial adenosine triphosphate after treatment with the antibiotic by measuring the luminescent light resulting from the reaction, whereby the ATP index is determined from the values obtained from the assay procedures. # January 2, 1979: Determination of antimicrobial susceptibilities on infected urines without isolation #* Method for the quick determination of the susceptibilities of various unidentified bacteria contained in an aqueous physiological fluid sample, particularly urine, to one or more antibiotics. A bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay is carried out after the elimination of non-bacterial ATP to determine whether an infection exists. If an infection does exist, a portion of the sample is further processed, including subjecting parts of the portion to one or more antibiotics. Growth of the bacteria in the parts are determined, again by an ATP assay, to determine whether the unidentified bacteria in the sample are susceptible to the antibiotic or antibiotics under test. # May 24, 1983: Rapid, quantitative determination of bacteria in water #* A bioluminescent assay for ATP in water borne bacteria is made by adding nitric acid to a water sample with concentrated bacteria to rupture the bacterial cells. The sample is diluted with sterile, deionized water, then mixed with a luciferase- luciferin mixture and the resulting light output of the bioluminescent reaction is measured and correlated with bacteria present. A standard and a blank also are processed so that the light output can be correlated to bacteria in the sample and system \\"noise\\" can be subtracted from the readings. A chemiluminescent assay for iron porphyrins in water borne bacteria is made by adding luminol reagent to a water sample with concentrated bacteria and measuring the resulting light output of the chemiluminescent reaction. The light output is correlated with bacteria present. A standard and a blank are also processed so that the light output can be correlated to bacteria in the sample and system \\"noise\\" can be subtracted from the readings(reword) # May 2, 1995: Method for determining surface coverage by materials exhibiting different fluorescent properties #* An improved method for detecting, measuring, and distinguishing crop residue, live vegetation, and mineral soil. By measuring fluorescence in multiple bands, live and dead vegetation are distinguished. The surface of the ground is illuminated with ultraviolet radiation, inducing fluorescence in certain molecules. The emitted fluorescent emission induced by the ultraviolet radiation is measured by means of a fluorescence detector, consisting of a photodetector or video camera and filters. The spectral content of the emitted fluorescent emission is characterized at each point sampled, and the proportion of the sampled area covered by residue or vegetation is calculated.

Although it weakened considerably before its Florida landfall, it was one of the most severe storms to affect the Bahamian capital Nassau and the island of New Providence in several years until the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, which occurred just two years later. The storm also delivered flooding rains and loss of crops to the southeastern United States and Florida. Meteorological history The system was first spotted east of the Lesser Antilles as a weak tropical storm on July 22. Moving northwest, the tropical storm passed near Dominica with winds of before entering the eastern Caribbean. It reached hurricane status at 06:00 UTC on July 23, and a short while later passed just south of Puerto Rico. The cyclone attained its first peak of before hitting Cabo Rojo early on July 24. San Juan recorded maximum winds of around and a low barometric pressure of as the eye of the hurricane passed near the extreme southwest corner of Puerto Rico. The storm continued northwest and tracked just east of Hispaniola, losing some intensity to land interaction; by 18:00 UTC on July 24 its winds diminished to . However, the storm began rapid re-intensification as it moved over the Turks and Caicos Islands early on July 25. The storm continued strengthening, attaining the equivalence of major hurricane status by 12:00 UTC that day. By the time it reached the central Bahamas at 00:00 UTC on July 26, it reached winds of . After 12:00 UTC, while still moving northwest, the cyclone made landfall on New Providence and crossed over Nassau, where winds were unofficially estimated at . Reducing its forward speed, the storm weakened considerably after passing New Providence, losing major hurricane status by 06:00 UTC on July 27. As the storm neared the Florida coast, it curved somewhat to the north-northwest and passed just east of Cape Canaveral early on July 28. It made landfall at 10:00 UTC near present-day Edgewater, near the Canaveral National Seashore just south of New Smyrna Beach, with winds of . Prior to reanalysis in 2010, the storm was estimated to have made landfall farther south, near Cocoa Beach. In Florida, the storm's lowest known barometric pressure of was estimated, although it was likely deeper near the Bahamas. After landfall, the storm curved northwestward and weakened rapidly as it moved inland, weakening to a tropical storm southwest of Jacksonville. On July 29, it moved across Georgia as a weakening tropical storm and entered Alabama as a tropical depression. It continued across the southeastern United States while losing tropical characteristics, gradually beginning to curve northeastward over Arkansas, Missouri, and the Ohio Valley, becoming extratropical by 00:00 UTC on August 1. It finally dissipated the following day as it moved northeastward over Lake Ontario. Impact On its path, the storm killed more than 287 people in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Bahamas, and Florida. In the Bahamas, the storm caused over 100 deaths, but the exact total varies from 106 to 146. Combined with two later storms in September and October, the entire hurricane season killed more than 300 people in the Bahamas. =Puerto Rico and Hispaniola= The storm initially caused little damage until it passed near Puerto Rico, where heavy crop damage, most notably to coffee plantations in the west-central region of the island, occurred. Strong winds affected the entire island, and all rivers in the southern half of the island overflowed their banks. Heavy rainfall of around occurred on the island, while the average rainfall reported for July was . About 25 people drowned when heavy floods resulted from rapid rise of rivers. Total losses in Puerto Rico were estimated at $2.350 million. The storm is known as the San Liborio hurricane for its effects in Puerto Rico. Estimated damage amounted to around $3 million in eastern Santo Domingo as the storm center passed over the eastern half of Hispaniola. =The Bahamas= The cyclone caused significant damage over much of the central Bahamas. The storm destroyed 500 homes‚Äî90% of the total‚Äîon Great Exuma Island, \\"swept away\\" roads and bridges, and ruined unharvested agricultural produce, including the entire corn crop. Dead livestock littered the landscape. On Eleuthera, the storm downed coconuts and other fruit crops; strong winds and high tides leveled 240 dwellings, 14 churches, and two schools on the island. On the island, the storm rendered most roads unusable and washed the primary causeways out to sea, leaving of water covering the island. At least 74 drownings occurred on nearby Cat Island. The storm also wrecked most of the homes on the Berry Islands. On Bimini, the hurricane razed a lighthouse and a wireless station; strong winds tore roofs off several churches and other buildings. After the storm, the crew of the USS Bay Spring delivered over of munitions and construction materials to aid the stricken residents. Nearby settlements on Andros lost most or all of their buildings; in some areas the storm ruined the sisal crop, felled 95% of the coconut trees, destroyed stone buildings, and left water more than deep. Although damage reports are not clear, the storm caused the most significant losses on New Providence, especially in Nassau, where \\"some roofs were torn off entirely\\" and the storm was \\"more fearful and devastating than any most people can remember\\", according to an eyewitness account posted in the July issue of the Monthly Weather Review. Trees, power poles, and various debris littered streets, and many people were left homeless. Automobiles at Nassau were also reported damaged by the storm, and flooding was reported. =Florida= Areas near the point of landfall reported significant damage to buildings, crops, and communications wires, especially New Smyrna Beach. The storm disrupted telephone and electric service in Daytona Beach, while high tides destroyed beachfront businesses and sank watercraft. Points farther south along the Florida coast, such as Miami, received only a brush from the storm, resulting in rains and some light wind damage, mainly to fruit crops. The Palm Beach area reported extensive coastal flooding that damaged coastal structures. The storm was also reported to have caused damage around the point of landfall in Melbourne, where uprooted citrus trees and roofs blown off were reported. An observer on Merritt Island reported a heavy storm surge along the Indian River that damaged or destroyed homes, docks, and boats. Substantial rainfall attended the storm in its passage over Florida, peaking at at Merritt Island. Damage estimates in Florida exceeded $2.5 million.

Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik is known as the founder of the Brisker Derech (also known as Lomdus, the conceptual approach to Talmudic study), and was famous for the brilliant manner with which he reconciled contradictions in Maimonides' writings.

It words are not understandable from only a light reading, even to those who are used to the Brisker way of thinking. The Grach's son, Rav Moshe zt'l, once said that the sefer is difficult because his father wrote it for men on his level, and he cited the Or Somayach zt'l as an example.

Sawney in the bog house, 1779, attributed to James Gillray. Sawney (sometimes Sandie/y, or Sanders, or Sannock) was an English nickname for a Scotsman, now obsolete, and playing much the same linguistic role that \\"Jock\\" does now. The name is a Lowland Scots diminutive of the favourite Scottish first name Alexander (also Alasdair in Scottish Gaelic form, anglicised into Alistair) from the last two syllables. The English commonly abbreviate the first two syllables into \\"Alec\\". From the days after the accession of James VI to the English throne under the title of James I, to the time of George III and the Bute administration, when Scotsmen were exceedingly unpopular and Dr. Samuel Johnson - the great Scotophobe, and son of a Scottish bookseller at Lichfield - thought it prudent to disguise his origin, and overdid his prudence by maligning his father's countrymen, it was customary to designate a Scotsman a \\"Sawney\\". This vulgar epithet, however, was dying out fast by the 1880s, and was obsolete by the 20th century. Sawney was a common figure of fun in English cartoons. A particularly racist example, Sawney in the Bog House, shows a stereotypical Scots Highlander using a communal bench toilet by sticking one of his legs down each of the holes. This was originally published in London in June 1745,British Museum example just over a month before \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" landed in Scotland to begin the Jacobite rising of 1745. In this version Sawney's excreta emerge from below his kilt and flow across the bench. The idea was revived in a different and slightly more decorous version of 1779, which is attributed to the young James Gillray. An inscription reads: :'Tis a bra' bonny seat, o' my saul, Sawney cries, :I never beheld sic before with me Eyes, :Such a place in aw' Scotland I never could meet, :For the High and the Low ease themselves in the Street.Sawney in the bog-house, British Museum, 1779 It has also been suggested that the Galloway cannibal Sawney Bean may have been a fabrication to emphasise the alleged savagery of the Scots. Sometimes also used in the term \\"Sawney Ha'peth\\", meaning \\"Scots halfpennyworth\\" implying \\"Scottish fool\\". At the time of the political union of Scotland and England in 1707, the Pound Scots was worth 1/12 of the Pound Sterling, thus a \\"Scots halfpennyworth\\" implies worthlessness. The word \\"sawney\\" survives in the current Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (OSPD), which validates the word in Scrabble tournament play, and is defined as \\"a foolish person\\".

Founded by Seleucus I Nicator or Antiochus I Soter to protect the military road across northern Pisidia. The city's surname Sidera (h√™ Sid√™ra, Ptol. v. 5. ¬ß 4; Hierocl. p. 673), is probably derives from iron-works in its vicinity. The city minted its own coins, some of which bear the image of the Asiatic divinity Men, who was worshipped at Antioch. The city was restored by the Roman emperor Claudius, and the name was changed to Claudioseleucia. This name is retained on the city's coins down to the time of Claudius II, though in Ptolemy, the Synecdemus of Hierocles, and the Notitiae Dignitatum the name is recorded as Seleucia.

The region came under the control of the British in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was annexed to the Bengal Presidency, the largest province of British India. After the Kol rebellion of 1831-2, the division was exempted by Regulation XIII of 1833 from the general laws and regulations governing Bengal, and every branch of the administration was vested in an officer appointed by the supreme Government and called the Agent to the Governor-General of India for the South-West Frontier. In 1854 the designation of South-West Frontier Agency was changed to Chota Nagpur and it began to be administered as a Non-regulation province under the Lieutenant Governor of the then Bihar. In 1855-56 there was the great uprising of the Santhals against the British but was brutally suppressed. was changed to Chota Nagpur by Act XX of that year, and was administered thereafter as a non- regulation province under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal Presidency.

Background Longfellow was owned, bred, and trained by \\"Uncle\\" John Harper of Nantura Stock Farm in Midway, Kentucky. Harper was worth perhaps a million dollars (a very great sum in the 1850s), yet he lived in a simple cottage on his 1,000 acres (4 km¬≤) adjacent to Robert A. Alexander's famed Woodburn Stud in Woodford County, Kentucky. In 1856, Harper stood both Lexington and Glencoe, two of the country's greatest stallions. Combined, they led America's sire lists for 24 years. Longfellow was sired by Leamington, the successor of Lexington, as noted: America's leading sire for 14 years. His dam was John Harper's foundation mare Nantura by Brawner's Eclipse). A brown colt with a white stripe, a white near hind sock, and white on his off hind coronet, Longfellow was foaled in 1867. When people asked Harper, born in 1800, if he had named his colt for the noted poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Harper replied, \\"Never heared much of that feller but that colt of mine's got the longest legs of any feller I ever seen.\\" At maturity, Longfellow stood 17 hands tall and was said to have a 26-foot stride. Longfellow was unraced at two while he matured into his size. Harper tried him out in the spring of his third year, entering him in the Phoenix Hotel Stakes--but he was green. He lost to another son of Leamington called Enquirer, who had an undefeated season. Racing career In 1871, Longfellow was entered in a match race at Lexington, Kentucky against a horse called Pilgrim. On the night before the race, Harper slept at Longfellow's head in a barn at the old Kentucky Association track. In the middle of the night, Harper was awakened by a rattling at the locked barn door. An unseen man asked to see Longfellow, but Harper ordered him to leave. Early the next morning came the news that Harper's sister Betsy and his brother Jacob, also both elderly, had been murdered in John's small cottage at Nantura. They had been hacked to death by a hatchet. All three were childless. If John had been home that night and was killed along with his brother and sister, the estate would have been divided among several nephews. It was suspected that a nephew named Adam Harper had committed the murders. Wallace Harper, another nephew, openly accused Adam of the crimes. Even though considerable evidence mounted against Adam Harper, he was never charged. Upon his death, Harper (who'd had Adam investigated privately, but never revealed the results) left everything to another nephew, Frank Harper. Longfellow's real racing career began in autumn of 1871. In sixteen starts, he won thirteen races, including the Monmouth Cup (beating Helmbold and Preakness), and the Saratoga Cup in 1871. In the Saratoga, only one horse ran against him: Kingfisher. In his next race, he lost to Helmbold, the horse he'd easily beaten in the Monmouth Cup. Longfellow's great size proved a disadvantage at 4 miles in deep mud. He took the Wooley Stakes and again won the Monmouth in 1872 and placed in the Saratoga Cup in 1872. Called \\"King of the Turf,\\" Longfellow was America's most popular horse in the decade after the American Civil War. His final season was noted for his rivalry with the eastern champion Harry Bassett, winner of the 1871 Travers Stakes in Saratoga, New York. Colonel McDaniel, Harry Bassett's owner, challenged Longfellow to a match race. John Harper replied that anyone wishing to test Longfellow's mettle could do so in the Monmouth Cup of 1872. McDaniel entered his horse. Longfellow headed east in a special car on which a sign was hung that read: \\"Longfellow on his way to Long Branch to meet his friend Harry Bassett.\\" Since all ten of the other entered horses had withdrawn from the race, it became a match. Longfellow beat Harry by over 100 yards. Their second meeting was in the two and a quarter mile Saratoga Cup. Approaching the start, Longfellow struck his left fore foot and twisted his racing plate. Coming around the first turn, it was obvious something was wrong with him, but his rider stood up in his stirrups and whipped the four-year-old colt for the first time in his career. Responding with a powerful surge, for 18 furlongs Longfellow closed the distance and lost to Harry Bassett (who'd broken the track record by 2 and a half seconds) by one length, leaving the track limping on three legs. His left front foot had been mutilated; the shoe had bent double during the race and embedded itself into the frog of his foot. This was Longfellow's last race. Stud record Longfellow sired two Kentucky Derby winners: Leonatus (who ate the roses presented as a prize) in the ninth running in 1883, and Riley in the sixteenth running in 1890. Leonatus was the champion three-year-old male in 1883, losing only one race as a juvenile and never again beaten. As a three-year-old, and within a period of 49 days, Leonatus won ten stakes races, all in Kentucky and Illinois. Among his fillies, he sired two Kentucky Oaks winners: Longitude in 1880, and Florimore in 1887. A leading sire in 1891, Longfellow produced progeny that included the racemare Thora, champion three-year-old female in 1881 and herself dam of Yorkville Belle (born in Tennessee in 1889, who made 37 starts, and came in the money 30 times with 21 victories). Thora won the Alabama Stakes, the Monmouth Oaks, and the Saratoga Cup. Longfellow also sired The Bard, the champion three-year-old male of 1886 and winner of the Preakness. Later, his get included American Derby winner Pink Coat, Suburban Handicap winner Tillo, 1889 Travers Stakes winner Long Dance, Longstreet, who was the 1891 American Horse of the Year, and the very good mares Peg Woffington and Lady Longfellow. Longfellow died on November 5, 1893, at the age of twenty-six. His grave marker is the second ever erected for a racehorse in Kentucky. (The first was for Hall of Famer Ten Broeck.) On Longfellow's marker are engraved the words: \\"King of Racers & King of Stallions.\\" New Jersey's Monmouth Park runs the $60,000 five and 1/2 furlong Longfellow Stakes for three-year-olds and up each year in June. Longfellow was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York, in 1971.

It is constructed and operated by the CELLS (sp: Consorcio para la Construcci√≥n, Equipamiento y Explotaci√≥n del Laboratorio de Luz de Sincrotr√≥n, or Consortium for the Exploitation of the Synchrotron Light Laboratory) consortium, and co- financed by the Spanish central administration and regional Catalan GovernmentSincrotr√≥n ALBA. La importancia de la luz. After nearly ten years of planning and design work by the Spanish scientific community, the project was approved in 2002 by the Spanish and the regional Catalan governments. After scientific workshops and meetings with prospective users, the facility was redesigned in 2004, and in 2006 construction started. The laboratory was officially opened for experiments on 7 beamlines in March 2010.  History  The project was launched in 1994, the construction began in 2003, and the official inauguration took place in March 2010. The total cost of the construction and equipment of the laboratory is estimated at 201.4 million euros. The cost of operating expenses is estimated at 15.5 million euros per year, so according to Joan Bordas, former director of the ALBA, must use about 5,000 of the 8,000 hours that the year has, as the cost of keep it on is the same with nine lines that with 30. The building that houses the project was completed at the end of 2009 and the complete operation of the facility will advance in successive phases, culminating in 2011. The official inauguration was carried out by the President of the Government Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero and the President of the Government of Catalonia Jose Montilla, together with scientists such as Ram√≥n Pascual, promoter of the project, on the 23rd of March 2010. It is a construction of great technical complexity due to the demands of the installation, which requires mechanical stability, temperature control and quality of the electrical supply. In July 2012, the first analysis experiments began. In its implementation, the ALBA synchrotron has had a demand four times greater than its current capacity (of 8 light lines), mostly by Spanish scientists.  Cronology  1990: First attempt to obtain funding for a synchrotron light source in Spain. 2003: The ALBA Synchrotron project was approved and funded in equal parts by the Spanish and the Catalonian Administration. For that purpose, the Consortium for the Construction, Equipping and Exploitation of the Synchrotron Light Source (CELLS) is created to manage the ALBA Synchrotron. Joan Bordas is appointed as General Director of ALBA. 2006: Construction begins, after a few years dedicated to the design and the training of a new team of experts coming from Spain and abroad. 2007: First electrons out of the ALBA LINAC electron gun are seen. 2008: The linear accelerator (LINAC) is installed. 2009: Installation of the Booster and Storage ring. 2010: First operational test of the Booster is performed. Results show that all the components, subsystems and equipment perform in accordance with the specifications. ALBA Synchrotron is inaugurated by the President of the Spanish Government, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, and the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Jos√© Montilla. 2011: Electron bem in the Storage ring of ALBA. First friendly user at the BOREAS beamline (an external researcher helping with the commissioning of the facility). 2012: BOREAS, MSPD, XALOC, NCD and CIRCE beamlines receive their first official users. At the end of 2012, appears the first ALBA publication, a report containing data collected from the MSPD beamline. In July, Caterina Biscari is appointed as the new director of the ALBA Synchrotron. 2013: By the beginning of 2013, the seven beamlines have already received official users.  Beamlines  = BL01 - MIRAS: INFRARED MICROSPECTROSCOPY = MIRAS is for Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and microscopy. FTIR is an potential instrument to recognize the vibrational signatures and in this manner the compound arrangement of materials. The beamline gives ALBA users a modern synchrotron-based infrared spectrometer and microscope capacity covering a wavelength range from around 1 ¬µm to ‚àº100 ¬µm with an spectral region designed at first for investigation between 2.5-14 ¬µm. Transmission, Reflection, Attenuated total reflection (ATR) and Grazing incidence are the most important geometries for sample analysis, and are all available at this beamline. = BL04 - MSPD: MATERIALS SCIENCE AND POWDER DIFFRACTION BEAMLINE = The Materials Science and Powder Diffraction Beamline is for high- resolution powder diffraction and high pressure powder diffraction using diamond anvil cells. The beamline works between 8 and 50 keV. This energy range adequately covers the desirable range for almost any powder diffraction experiment, and at the same time it is possible to perform both total scattering experiments, and high pressure diffraction, for which it is not only desirable but sometimes necessary to have high-energy sources (E>30 KeV). There are two experimental end stations to accommodate the different experimental techniques, one devoted to high resolution powder diffraction and the second one is dedicated to high pressure experiments. = BL09 - MISTRAL: SOFT X-ray microscopy = \\"The full-field Transmission X-ray Microscopy beamline MISTRAL is devoted to cryo nano-tomography in the water window and multi-keV spectral regions (E = 270eV ‚Äì 2600eV) for biological applications. In addition, spectroscopic imaging (a series of 2D images over a range of X-ray wavelengths) at several interesting X-ray absorption edges can be performed. The Transmission X-ray Microscope (TXM) works from 270 eV to 1200 eV. A single-reflection elliptical glass capillary condenser focuses monochromatic light on to the sample, which is at cryo-temperature. The transmitted signal is collected by an objective Fresnel Zone plate (of 25 or 40 nm outermost zone widths) and a magnified image is delivered to a direct illumination CCD camera. The routinely expected spatial resolution in 2D is 30 nm and ‚âà50 nm for tomographies. An upgrade of the microscope to higher energies (i.e. Zernike phase contrast at 2600 eV) is planned, as well as the development of correlated fluorescence visible light microscopy. Facilities for sample cryo-preparation as well as software reconstruction and analysis are available for the users.\\" = BL11 - NCD-SWEET: NON-CRYSTALLINE DIFFRACTION = Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments provide structural and dynamic information of large molecular assemblies like polymers, colloids, proteins and fibres. A wide range of fields (medicine, biology, chemistry, physics, archaeological, environmental and conservation sciences and materials) can be covered by this technique. SAXS is a very powerful technique that is used to study the supramolecular organization in biological systems, the structure and function of muscle filaments, corneal transparency, biological membranes, polymer processing, self assembly of mesoscopic metal particles, colloids, inorganic aggregates, liquid crystals and devices. Recording simultaneously SAXS and WAXS (Wide Angle X-ray Scattering) results in a length scale which ranges from a few microns to a few angstroms. = BL13 - XALOC: MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY = XALOC aims to provide the present and future Structural Biology groups with a flexible and reliable tool to help in finding solutions for structures of macromolecules and complexes. The beamline copes with a broad variety of crystal sizes and unit cell parameters, and allows both wavelength dependent and independent experiments. = BL22 - CL√ÜSS: CORE LEVEL ABSORPTION & EMISSION SPECTROSCOPIES = The CLAESS beamlne is providing a simultaneous and unified access to two complementary techniques: X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopes. The incoming energy range is 2.4 - 63.2 keV. The outcoming energy range selectable by CLEAR spectrometer is 6.4 - 12.5 keV. The sample set-ups give access to low/high-temperature (10-320 K, 80-1000 K), low/high-energy measurements (in transmission and fluorescence mode), \\"in situ\\" solid-gas reactors. A chemical laboratory in close proximity to the beamline (glove box, pellet press, fume cupboards, analytical balance etc.) is also available. = BL24-CIRCE: PHOTOEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY AND MICROSCOPY = BL24 - CIRCE is a variable polarization soft X-ray beamline dedicated to advanced photoemission experiments. = BL29 - BOREAS: RESONANT ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING = The variable polarization soft X-ray beamline is dedicated to fundamental, as well as applied, polarization-dependent spectroscopic investigation of advanced materials.

He studied piano and violin at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow before going on to become keyboard player in the live line-up of Stiltskin, a rock band with the number 1 hit single \\"Inside\\" in the UK in 1994. Duguid went on to work with other Scottish acts such as Gun (later to change their name to g.u.n. in the wake of the Dunblane massacre) and then Fish (ex-Marillion vocalist). Duguid has since appeared on several albums by Stiltskin's old vocalist Ray Wilson, who for a short time in the late 1990s was lead singer with Genesis. In 2004 he worked on some demo material with Paolo Nutini and appeared as Paolo's keyboard player at 2 events, a live BBC Radio Scotland session and a gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut. In 2006 he began writing songs with singer Louise Rutkowski, 7 years later in 2013 had finished an album of work (Diary of a Lost Girl) which was funded by Pledge Music and finally released in 2014. 2007 saw Duguid producing the double album Duan Nollaig by Fiona Mackenzie. This was released on the Greentrax record label and is believed to be the first such collection of Christmas songs and Carols in the Gaelic language. He also arranged most of the 35 songs and played piano on about half of these. Scots singer Karen Matheson was one of the guest vocalists on the album. Duguid has appeared as a keyboard player on many UK touring musicals including We Will Rock You, The Producers, The Full Monty and on The Bodyguard in London.

History Drogheda Grammar School was founded under Royal Charter in 1669 by Erasmus Smith and is one of the oldest secondary schools in Ireland. It was originally a boys‚Äô boarding school but has now been a co-educational boarding and day school for over fifty years. It is owned by a company with charitable status called Drogheda Grammar School Ltd. This structure was set up in the early 1950s when a group of local people (mostly Quakers) saved the school from closure. Although the school is not a Quaker school, it is run under the Quaker principle of \\"every individual is of value and has something to contribute\\". This philosophy is fundamental to the Mission Statement of the school. It is located on 18 acres in a rural setting. The campus consists of a Regency house flanked by woodland, with classroom and dormitory buildings and playing fields.  Academic performance  The most recent statistics outlining the top feeder schools in the country for third level education placed Drogheda Grammar School as the top school in the area with 100% of it students progressing to 3rd level education in 2015.

History The municipality began in 1949 with the settlement of Rio do Peixe. Manuel Ribeiro Campos arrived with his family, bought lands and built his house along the banks of this river. The first roads were opened by Campos himself using an axe and machete. Campos and his workers built a landing strip in the jungle and the first plane landed in 1951. In 1958 Dovercindo Borges arrived becoming the local political leader. At this time Rio do Peixe belonged to the municipality of Caiap√¥nia. In 1964 the first bulldozer arrived and the dense vegetation began to be opened up for farmland and cattle pastures. In 1969 Rio do Peixe was elevated to district status and the name was changed to Doverl√¢ndia, in homage to its founder Dovercindo Borges. In 1982 it became an independent municipality.

Differing versions of the soup exist in some cultures and are viewed as a delicacy. Versions = China = In China, and in several countries with large populations of Chinese people, such as Singapore, turtle soup is a delicacy. The meat, skin and innards of the turtle are used in the soup. Soft-shelled turtles such as Pelodiscus sinensis are commonly consumed in this manner in Chinese cuisine,Forest Soft-shell Turtle (Dogania subplana) , www.science.edu.sg, accessed August 6, 2007. while consumption of hard-shelled turtles is often avoided due to their mythical connotations. However, the hard shells of certain turtles are used in the preparation of a dish called Guilinggao or \\"turtle jelly\\". See in particular APPENDIX 1: \\"Golden Coin Turtle\\" (A report dated April 27, 2002 by ECES News (Earth Crash Earth Spirit)), and APPENDIX 3: \\"Tortoise Jelly (Turtle Jelly)\\". Quote: \\"The popularity of turtle jelly can be seen in the success of Ng Yiu-ming. His chain of specialty stores has grown from one shop in 1991 to 68 today, in Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China. Ng also packs turtle jelly into portable containers sold at convenience stores. He insists no golden coin turtles are used. 'They're too expensive' he said. '‚Ä¶ [I]f you know how to choose the herbal ingredients, jelly made from other kinds of turtles will be just as good.'\\" = England = Turtle soup gained popularity in England in the 1750s but declined rapidly about 150 years later due to overfishing. According to food historian Janet Clarkson, the dish, which she calls out as one of several \\"noteworthy soups\\", became a symbol for civic dinners; she wrote, \\"From 1761 to 1825 it was never absent from the London Lord Mayor's Day Banquet. It is probably not unreasonable to hold several generations of aldermen and other civic leaders responsible for eating the turtle almost to exctinction.\\" Green turtle first became popular in England as \\"sea-tortoise\\" circa 1728: \\"Its Flesh is between that of Veal, and that of a Lobster, and is extremely pleasant ... They are frequently brought to England in Tubs of Sea Water, and will keep alive a long time.\\"The Country Housewife and Lady's Director, by Prof. R Bradley, 1728 The earliest English recipes are for roast or boiled turtle, only later being used in a soup. About 1740‚Äì1750, it began to be widely imported to England, from Ascension Island or the West Indies. Samuel Birch is credited with being the first to serve turtle soup in London, spicing it with lemons and cayennes; it quickly became immensely popular, and as Lord Dudley has stated, \\"Of British soup, turtle always takes precedence in the list of honour\\".Soup Through the Ages: A Culinary History with Period Recipes, by Victoria R. Rumble, McFarland, 2009, page 66. Giles Rose made turtle soup as follows: \\"Take your tortoises and cut off their heads and feet and boyl them in fair water, and when they are almost boyl'd, put to them some white wine, some sweet herbs, and a piece of bacon, and give them a brown in the frying pan with good butter, then lay upon your bread a-steeping in good strong broth, and well-seasoned; garnish the dish with green sparrow-grass [asparagus] and lemon over it.\\"Rumble, loc. cit. In Cookery and Domestic Economy (1862), the recipe begins as follows: take the turtle out of the water, turn it on its back, tie its feet, cut off its head.Cookery and Domestic Economy, Mrs. Somerville, 1862. By about 1800, a good dinner portion was six pounds of turtle, live weight, and in London Tavern in August, 1808, 400 men ate 2,500 pounds of turtle in their dinner soup.Rumble, loc. cit. According to Clarkson, \\"It is difficult to overestimate the magnitude of the demand for turtles\\" during the period of the soup's popularity. As many as 15 thousand turtles were shipped live to Britain from the West Indies. Because of its popularity, the green turtle population plummeted from overhunting, and its cost rose correspondingly. As Isabella Beeton noted in 1861, \\"This is the most expensive soup brought to the table\\".Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management: Abridged Edition, by Isabella Beeton, Oxford University Press, 2008, page 93. Thus long before that time, mock turtle soup made from calf's head was widely adopted as a more economical substitute and became popular in its own right, with the two dishes sometimes being served at the same banquet. = United States = In the United States, the common snapping turtle has long been the principal species used for turtle soup.Keith Sutton, Snapping turtle makes for a delicious dinner In this case the soup is also referred to as snapper turtle soup,Turtle Soup/task/display/itemid/79787/recipeid/79449 Snapper Turtle Soup Recipe or simply snapper soup (not to be confused with red snapper soup, which is made from the fish red snapper). It is a heavy, brown soup with an appearance similar to thick meat gravy. In Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley, snapper turtle soup is an established part of Philadelphia cuisine. The famed seafood restaurant Old Original Bookbinder's, is known for its soups, including snapper soup; a canned version is also sold in grocery stores. Turtle soup (and other dishes from turtle meat) are still served by a few restaurants in Minnesota, mostly on Fridays during Lent. It is said that it is primarily older customers who have previously eaten turtle who order the turtle dishes; younger diners are much less interested. Among Creole communities, turtle soup is known as Caouane. In New Orleans, it is a specialty of several neighborhood and classic Creole restaurants such as Commander's Palace, Brennan's, and Galatoire's. Turtle soup was the 27th U.S. President William Howard Taft's favorite food. He brought a chef who specialized in the dish with him into the White House for the specific purpose of preparing this soup.  Poisoning  Eating the flesh of some marine turtles can cause a type of rare, but possibly lethal food poisoning called chelonitoxism.

The governments of Bangkok and Pattaya are divided into two branches: executive and legislative. Bangkok: the executive branch is led by the Governor of Bangkok (‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£ Phu Wa Ratchakan Krung Thep Maha Nakhon) and the legislative branch is led by the Council of Bangkok (‡∏™‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£ Sapha Krung Thep Maha Nakhon). The territory of Bangkok is divided into districts (‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏ï khet).Bangkok Metropolis Administrative Organisation Act, BE 2528 (1985), section 7. There are now 50 districts. The government of each district is also divided into two branches: the executive branch led by a district director (‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏ï phu amnuai kan khet) and the legislative branch led by a district council (‡∏™‡∏†‡∏≤‡πÅ‡∏Ç‡∏ß‡∏á sapha khwaeng).Bangkok Metropolis Administrative Organisation Act, BE 2528 (1985), sections 68 and 71. Each district is then divided into subdistricts (‡πÅ‡∏Ç‡∏ß‡∏á khwaeng). There are now 180 subdistricts. Each subdistrict is led by a subdistrict head (‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÅ‡∏Ç‡∏ß‡∏á hua na khwaeng). The Governor of Bangkok and the Councillors of Bangkok are directly elected by the citizens of Bangkok.Bangkok Metropolis Administrative Organisation Act, BE 2528 (1985), sections 9, 10 and 44. The district directors and the subdistrict heads are appointed by the Governor of Bangkok from amongst the Bangkok metropolitan officers (‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£), whilst the district councillors are directly elected by the local citizens.Bangkok Metropolis Administrative Organisation Act, BE 2528 (1985), section 71. Pattaya:, the executive branch is led by the Mayor of Pattaya (‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏û‡∏±‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏≤ Nayok Mueang Phatthaya) and the legislative branch is led by the Council of Pattaya (‡∏™‡∏†‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏û‡∏±‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏≤ Sapha Mueang Phatthaya). The Mayor of Pattaya and the Councillors of Pattaya are directly elected by the citizens of Pattaya.Pattaya City Administrative Organisation Act, BE 2542 (1999), sections 8, 9 and 41. There is a plan to adopt the special local government in Chiang Mai, which would turn Chiang Mai Province into Chiang Mai Metropolis (‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£ Chiang Mai Maha Nakhon). The plan was proposed to the National Assembly by the citizens of Chiang Mai in October 2013. However, it is regarded by the conservatives as separatism. There is also a plan to establish Mae Sot City (‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏î Nakhon Mae Sot) in Tak Province. The city would cover the current areas of Mae Sot City Municipality (‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏®‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏î) and Tha Sai Luat Subdistrict Municipality (‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏®‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏ö‡∏•‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏î). The plan would also result in the dissolution of both municipalities.  Historical subdivisions  From the beginning of the 20th century until 1932 there was an additional subdivision called monthon (‡∏°‡∏ì‡∏ë‡∏•, circle), with some of the larger monthons subdivided into boriwen (‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏ì, area). The first provinces were named mueang (‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á, township) as those developed from the historical city- states. There were both mueang directly dependent from Bangkok (thus similar to the modern province), as well as mueang under the supervision of a more powerful neighbouring mueang, or part of the semi-independent tributary states. In 1906 the transition to the term changwat started, which was finalised in 1916. After the abolition of the monthon, a new subdivision named \\"region\\" (‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏Ñ, Phak) was established. At first there were four regions with changing outlines. These were changed into nine regions in 1951. In 1956 these regions were abolished as well. A former municipal level were the sukhaphiban (sanitation districts, ‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏†‡∏¥‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏•), which were mostly responsible for sanitary tasks like waste management. The administrative level was created in 1908, in May 1999 all were converted into subdistrict municipalities. Until 2007 minor districts (king amphoe) were a special kind of districts, still partially a subordinate of another district. Usually newly created districts at first became minor districts and were upgraded to full districts after a few years. On 24 August 2007 all 81 minor districts were upgraded to full districts, despite many still not meeting the prerequisites for becoming a full district.  Informal subdivisions  Bangkok and its vicinity (‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏°‡∏ì‡∏ë‡∏•, pari monthon), including five adjacent provinces are referred to as Bangkok Metropolitan Region - BMR (). There are several definitions of regions in Thailand. The one used by the National Statistical Office defines four regions - north, northeast, south and central. Los Angeles, California is sometimes jokingly referred to as \\"The 78th Province\\" of Thailand, because the city has the highest Thai population of any city outside of Thailand (roughly 100,000).

It is a documentary about Hip hop rivalries and beefs (arguments). It was released on DVD on November 15, 2005. It was directed and produced by Peter Spirer and lasts approximately 85 minutes. It was narrated by DJ Kay Slay and scored by Nu Jerzey Devil. The next film in the series is called Beef IV. Beefs =Twista vs. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony= During the mid-to-late 1990s, rappers from parts other than New York City and Los Angeles were emerging. Among them were Twista (a Chicago native) and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony (their members originate from both Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio). They both became very popular for their quick, rapid-fire style of rapping delivery. The beef started with a dispute over who originated this style. Bone Thugs say that Twista did not come out with the rapid-fire style. Layzie Bone elaborated and said \\"yeah he came spittin it a hundred miles an hour but he wasn't adding the harmony like us\\". Twista attacked back with \\"Crook County\\" feat. Psychodrama, calling Bone \\"Hoes of the Harmony.\\" However, Layzie Bone and Twista became good friends and they dropped \\"Mid- West Invasion,\\" soon thereafter the beef ended. Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone still had beef with Twista, they put out subliminal messages dissing Twista in Krayzie Bone's \\"Gemini\\" album and \\"Leatherface: The Legend\\" underground album. It was until the \\"Spit Your Game\\" video shoot that Krayzie, Wish and Twista ended their Beef. =Chingy vs. Nelly= St. Louis' own Chingy was an emerging artist mainly from the help he received from Nelly, the biggest premiere rap artist to so far come out of the Gateway City. Nelly decided to take Chingy with him on tour, but Chingy felt that Nelly was trying to take all the fame and keep him under his wings, to Chingy's dissatisfaction. Because of lack of recognition, Chingy became disenchanted. Then Ludacris and his Disturbing tha Peace record label offered Chingy a record deal, and he then traded shots at Nelly. Nelly also felt disrespected by Chingy, stating to the press that Chingy never gave credit to Nelly because of the success he was having. Then it escalated when Nelly Released his 2004 album \\"Sweat\\" with the song \\"Another One\\" which was a back handed form of flattery to remind Chingy who came out first. So Chingy struck back on \\"We Got\\". At the Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas, Chingy approached Nelly to squash the beef. But to no avail. Chingy also challenges Nelly's claim of the word \\"Derrrty\\" saying he's a liar and the people have been saying \\"Derrrty\\" prior to The St. Lunatics coming out. As tension began to heat up through St. Louis between Derrty Ent. and the Chingy camp, Ching knew there was one man who could reason with both men. That man would be M.J., who is Nelly's cousin and has raised Chingy since he was six. Chingy got MJ to talk to Nelly to resolve the problem. In 2006, Chingy appeared in Ali & Gipp's video \\"Go Head\\", therefore squashing the beef. =Lil Scrappy vs. Orlando Police Department= Lil Scrappy was performing at a concert in a high school gym in Orlando. During the concert, the crowd were really getting pumped and excited by the music, then the local police stepped in. They gave Scrappy a warning, because he took his shirt off (which made female fans even more aggressive). The reasoning for this was because the police were afraid of a potential riot. They stated that if Scrappy were to do something like this they would cancel the concert. Then, Scrappy did a stagedive, which made the police react and they entered the stage and stopped the music. An officer then bumped into Lil Scrappy's manager making him angry. The same officer then rushed over to Lil Scrappy and pushes him off stage. =Ludacris vs. T.I.= The beef originally started when T.I. saw Disturbing tha Peace rapper I-20's video for the song Fighting In The Club featuring Chingy, Tity Boi and Fate Wilson. In the video, a guy was wearing a shirt with the words \\"Trap House.\\" The guy was getting beat up and stomped in the video. T.I. thought it said \\"Trap Muzik\\". Former G-Unit artist Young Buck asked fellow Southern rappers T.I. and Ludacris to appear on his new record on the track \\"Stomp\\". T.I. recorded a verse, which contained a line that Young Buck considered to be a subliminal diss towards Ludacris \\"Me gettin' beat down?/That's ludicrous/\\". Young Buck spoke to Ludacris about the verse, to maintain his neutrality in the beef. Ludacris then recorded the verse that can be found on the album.Young Buck To 'Stomp' Out Luda/ T.I. Beef On Debut Album T.I's record company wanted Ludacris to change his verse before they sanctioned it but Ludacris refused and T.I. was therefore replaced by Game on the album version. Ludacris and T.I. sat down and talked about it and are now on good terms. The beef reignited since the film when T.I. made a disrespectful comment on his single \\"You Know What It Is\\", about Ludacris winning his grammy for rap album of the year (\\"Release Therapy\\") which he and T.I. were both nominees (\\"King\\"). The comment made was T.I. saying he felt that Ludacris didn't deserve the award and that T.I. actually had the rap album of the year. He also dissed Ludacris on his verse to Rocko's song \\"Umma Do Me.\\" However, the two are once again on good terms, and were featured on each other's albums in 2008. =Lil Flip vs. T.I.= They were both doing a photoshoot for The Source. Producer Nick Fury asked T.I. to do a verse on Lil Flip's \\"Game Over\\" remix, so T.I. discussed this with Lil Flip and his record label, and decided to do it. each rapper's entourages) until it eventually died out. They both made amends shortly after The Game and 50 Cent did so in similar fashion (although Lil Flip's and T.I.'s beef has remained settled). =The Game vs. Yukmouth= Yukmouth first met The Game at a club, at the time Yukmouth was engaged in a feud with 50 Cent and G-Unit. The Game released a diss track aimed at the rapper over the \\"I Got 5 on It\\" beat, a song which Yukmouth recorded when he was a part of Luniz. Yukmouth responded with a track that mocked The Game's appearance on Change of Heart. The two later tried to bury the hatchet, due to a personal friend and even recorded a song together with C-Bo's prot√©g√© Speedy, named \\"Peace\\". However the rivalry continued afterward, since Game dissed Yukmouth on the \\"Peace\\" song (they recorded their verses separately). [3] Since then, Yukmouth responded by releasing the song and music video \\"Game Over Part 2\\" over Fabolous' \\"Breathe\\" instrumental in which it parodied Game. In the video there is a lookalike of the rapper getting robbed and beaten up. Yukmouth claimed on the song that Game had a tongue ring and was slapped by mogul Suge Knight. Since the West Coast Peace Conference both rappers ended the feud. =Game vs. G-Unit= For further information on this beef, see G-Unit vs. G-Unit. When Beef III finished production, the beef between The Game and 50 Cent was thought to be over (or everted from higher levels). Beef III ended with the truce the two rappers had held in New York City, where they each donated over $200,000 dollars to charity. This documentary ended with the feeling that for now it looked like an East vs. West rivalry was avoided. There was somewhat of a cliffhanger when in the end the DVD stated that at least for now a coast vs. coast beef was gone. Since Beef III was released, the rivalry had actually intensified. In an extended interview found in the extras portion of this DVD, Game further explained his dissatisfaction with 50 Cent and G-Unit, including footage of a concert where Game performed at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (just eight miles across the Hudson River from New York City), in which he threw his G-Unit chain into the back row of the crowd.

It is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Security.Israel Prison Service. Ministry of Public Security. Retrieved on 7 March 2011. In 2014, the IPS employed 8,800 workers. History The IPS is divided into three blocs: North (north of Netanya), Center (between Netanya and Ashdod), and South (south of Ashkelon and Jerusalem). The IPS is headed by the Commissioner of Prisons. In 2014, there were 33 correctional facilities, including five detention centers, housing a total of 25,000 prisoners. 60% were serving time for criminal offenses and 40% for security offences. In December 2011, there were 307 administrative detainees held without trial. Of these detainees seventeen had been detained for between two and four and a half years. One had been detained for more than five years. None were minors.Israel Prison Service personnel are trained in krav maga (\\"contact combat\\") and conduct training for the prison service (kli'a) wing of the Israeli Military Police. Living conditions and prisoners' rights =Positive findings= Conditions in Israeli prisons generally meet international standards. IPS facilities, interrogation facilities and IDF provisional detention centers are regularly monitored by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and occasionally, by the Israel Bar Association and Public Defender's Office. Prison conditions are equal for male and female prisoners, and all prisoners are free to practice their religion. All Israeli citizens have the right to vote whilst in prison. Inmates are entitled to visits from their lawyers and family members, and security prisoners are allowed Red Cross visits. Inmates who are married or in common-law relationships have the right to conjugal visits. In 2011, ICRC maintained a program that enabled Palestinians from the West Bank to visit relatives held in Israeli prisons. A similar scheme for the Gaza Strip was halted by the Israeli government following the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007. Prison inmates have the right to file grievances about their conditions to the courts, the Israel Prison Service management and the Israel Police Unit for the investigation of Prison Service personnel. Credible allegations of inhumane conditions are duly investigated by the authorities, which documents the results publicly. Inmates who were not convicted of terrorism offenses also have the right to free university education, under a special education program in which they take online academic programs from the Open University of Israel, and their tuition is financed by prison authorities. This right was rescinded for those imprisoned for terrorism offenses in 2011. =Negative findings= In a report of the Public Defense Office based on unannounced inspections, the living conditions at the facilities, as of 2017‚Äì18, were found to be often unfit for human habitation, along with widespread cases of inmates' rights violation.Michael Bachner, Report finds inhumane treatment of inmates widespread in Israeli prisons, The Israel Times,12 May 2019, accessed 8 September 2019 On 25 March 2020, a Palestinian political prisoner in the Nafha prison of Israel reportedly set fire to a guard room protesting against the neglect shown towards the health conditions of the prisoners by the prison administrations, amid the coronavirus outbreak. The inmate, Ayman Sharabati, who is serving a life sentence at the prison, set fire to the guard room when he along with other prisoners was sent out for walk, according to Qadri Abu Bakr, head of the Palestinian Authority's Prisoners Affairs Commission. Reportedly, the IPS lacks the appropriate medical aid and provision necessary to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 among the prisoners. Privately run prisons The Knesset passed a law allowing private prisons in 2004, and plans for privately run prisons were introduced in 2006. The state hoped to save money by transferring prisoners to such facilities, which would eliminate the need to invest in more infrastructure and manpower. In 2009, the Israeli Supreme Court struck down the plans, ruling that private prisons are an unconstitutional violation of basic human rights.

Nahshon is the IPS's main intervention and conveyance unit and deals with searches, silencing disturbances, guarding IPS staff, etc. The Nachson unit is the operational arm of the Israel Prison Service (IPS). The unit was established in 1973, and serves as the central unit for the observation of prisoners, operational interventions and security. The tasks of the unit include, among others: escorting prisoners and detainees from an incarceration facility to another location, and intervening during irregular events that may take place to establish order and security. The unit helps conduct broad searches within prisons to find weapons, drugs, information, notes, explosives, mobile phones, SIM cards, and any information about possible enemy terrorist attacks. The unit must also ensure the safety of prison staff members who have been threatened (them and their families) by delivering prisoners to foreign countries as part of international extradition agreements for prisoners, escorting detainees to court and he is responsible for maintaining the security of the courtroom, and even escorts dangerous prisoners on their home visits and when they leave prison for medical treatment. Members of the Nachshon unit escort around 1,800 prisoners, criminals and terrorists daily in the unit's vehicles, resulting in an annual number of 390,000 prisoners. The unit has hundreds of specially designed operational vehicles, from buses to trucks to motorcycles, all of which are adapted to escort the prisoners. Vehicles serve as mobile prisons, transporting a violent and dangerous sector of society that is very likely to try to escape. These vehicles can operate both day and night and can reach anywhere in the country. The Nachshon unit is divided into 3 brigades scattered throughout the country (north, center and south), and under the command of the unit's headquarters. www.gov.il/en IPS Special Units. = Yamar Dror = Yamar Dror, founded at the end of 1993, is the IPS unit for fighting narcotics.

The song is a popular worship ballad. It is commonly sung at Christian churches, festivals and youth gatherings. The song was ranked No. 1 on the Christian Copyright Licensing International (CCLI) two years in a row and was still ranked on their Top 25 Songs list in 2016.  Writing and inspiration  Tim Hughes wrote this song in 1999 as a response to how he felt after reading Philippians 2. The passage speaks about Christ's humility and how He willingly left His throne in heaven, came to earth as a man, and sacrificed Himself on the cross all because of His love for us. With this passage in mind, Tim picked up his guitar and, as he sang, the words to the song flowed out, but he was not satisfied with the chorus and felt that it did not flow well with the song. For several months, he struggled with the chorus and even put the song aside for about six months before finally finishing it. However, he was still not confident in the chorus. It was not until he played this song at his home church Soul Survivor, and his pastor told him to play the song more often, that he realized the potential the song had. Since then, this song has spread and become widely known. Tim Hughes himself said. \\"No one has been more surprised than myself at seeing how God has used this worship song.\\" The themes in the song are the life of Jesus, thankfulness, and worship.  Composition  \\"Here I Am to Worship\\" is a slow worship ballad with a length of five minutes and fifteen seconds. The song is set in common time and has a tempo of 75 beats per minute. It is written in the key E Major. The verses follow the chord progression E - B - F‚ôØm - A - E - B - A, the chorus follows the progression E - B - C‚ôØm - A, and the bridge follows the progression B - E - A.

It is located southeast of the capital city of Port Louis. The airport was previously known as the Plaisance Airport and has direct flights to several destinations in Africa, Asia, Europe and is home to the country's national airline Air Mauritius. Airports of Mauritius Co. Ltd (AML) is the owner and operator of the airport, the Government of Mauritius is the major shareholder of AML.  History  As a part of the defense of Mauritius, in 1942, when Mauritius was a Crown colony, the government started construction of a Royal Naval Air Station at Plaisance near Mah√©bourg. This was subsequently handed over to the Royal Air Force at the end of World War II and civilian operations started shortly afterwards. The operations of the civil airport started just after the Second World War which gave a boost to the Mauritian economy. The first flight to Rodrigues island was made on 10 September 1972, an Air Mauritius flight from Plaisance Airport to the Plaine Corail Airport (now Sir Ga√´tan Duval Airport) at Rodrigues using a Twin Otter (3B-NAB). Later the Twin Otters were replaced by ATR 42-300 and ATR 42-500 twin turboprops. Later in 1986, infrastructure works were undertaken to accommodate larger aircraft. Thus, a new terminal was built including airbridges to meet the expected increase in traffic growth, and a car park attached to the new building and customs service for international routes. The new terminal consisted of two floors and could accommodate up to four aircraft simultaneously via airbridges.  Facilities  A new passenger terminal was inaugurated on 30 August 2013, and became fully operational in September 2013. The structure of the New Airport Terminal is designed after the \\"Traveller's palm\\", a tropical plant that grows on Mauritius. It is connected to the existing terminal (refurbishment began in 2014) and has a capacity of 4 million passengers. Airport Terminal Operations Ltd (ATOL) is responsible for the design, building and operation of the new terminal building. The new terminal, which cost US$306 million, is in line with the \\"Maurice Ile Durable\\" concept. Environmental and ecological aspects taken into consideration include using solar energy collected by photovoltaic cells, recovering rain water, integrating nature to the heart of the building, and including thermo- insulated facades to reduce heat gain. The terminal covers an area of 57,000 square meters and is equipped with five boarding gates with airbridges, including one compatible with the large Airbus A380, check-in desks for departing passengers, immigration counters, and baggage carousels.

It is a fictional treatment of the early life of Friedrich von Hardenberg who, under the pseudonym Novalis, later became a practitioner of German Romanticism. The novel was the first book published in paperback by Mariner Books, then a new imprint of Houghton Mifflin. Mariner Books went on to publish paperback editions of all of Penelope Fitzgerald's books. In 2012 The Observer named The Blue Flower one of \\"the ten best historical novels\\".  Setting  The novel is based on the life of Friedrich von Hardenberg (1772-1801) before he became famous under the name Novalis. It covers the years from 1790 to 1797 when von Hardenberg was a student of history, philosophy and law at the universities of Jena, Leipzig and Wittenberg, and before he embarked on his professional life.  Plot  In 1794 the 22 year old von Hardenberg becomes mystically attracted to the 12-year-old Sophie von K√ºhn, an unlikely choice for an intellectual of noble birth given Sophie's age and lack of education and culture, as well as her physical plainness and negligible material prospects. The couple become engaged a year later but never marry as Sophie dies of consumption a few days after her 15th birthday. The blue flower of the novel's title is the subject of the first chapter of a story that von Hardenberg is writing. In it, a young man longs to see the blue flower that \\"lies incessantly at his heart, so that he can imagine and think about nothing else\\". Von Hardenberg reads his draft chapter to Sophie and others, and asks \\"what is the meaning of this blue flower?\\" No definitive answer is given within the novel, leaving the reader to provide his or her own interpretation. Background Fitzgerald first came upon the notion of blue flowers having literary significance in \\"The Fox\\", a short story by D. H. Lawrence. She first became interested in Novalis in the early 1960s, after hearing a musical setting of his mystical Hymns to the Night. Later she conducted research on Burne-Jones and his language of flowers, and discovered that his father-in-law, George MacDonald, was a Novalis enthusiast. At the end of Fitzgerald's earlier novel The Bookshop a gentian, a blue flower that has faded into colourlessness, is mentioned as having been pressed into one of two books. In another of her novels, The Beginning of Spring, Selwyn rhapsodizes about the \\"blue stream flowing gently over our heads\\", an unattributed quotation from Novalis. Reception and critical review In a 2010 introduction to the novel, Frank Kermode called it \\"the finest work of this extraordinarily gifted novelist\\". The New York Times Book Review opined that \\"There is no better introduction than this novel to the intellectual exaltation of the Romantic era ...\\" Writing in The New York Times, Michael Hofmann called it \\"a quite astonishing book, a masterpiece\\". The novel has attracted critical attention and has a chapter of its own in Peter Wolfe's Understanding Penelope Fitzgerald and in Hermione Lee's Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life.

He joined the abortive plot to oust Nikita Khrushchev from power in 1957, and was denounced and removed from power. Rehabilitated after Khrushchev's downfall, he lived a largely obscure retirement. Childhood Dmitri Shepilov was born in Askhabad in (current capital of Turkmenistan) the Transcaspian Oblast of the Russian Empire in a working-class family of Russian ethnicity. He graduated from the Law School of the Moscow State University in 1926 and was sent to work in Yakutsk, where he worked as a deputy prosecutor and acting prosecutor for Yakutia. In 1928‚Äì1929 Shepilov worked as an assistant regional prosecutor in Smolensk. In 1931‚Äì1933 Shepilov studied at the Institute of Red ProfessorsWilliam Taubman. Khrushchev: The Man and His Era, New York, W. W. Norton and Co., 2003, p.314. in Moscow while simultaneously working as the \\"responsible secretary\\" of the magazine On the Agrarian Front. After graduating in 1933, Shepilov was made head of the political department of a sovkhoz. In 1935 he was made Deputy Chief of the Sector of Agricultural Science of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1937 Shepilov became a Doctor of Science and was made the Scientific Secretary of the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He also taught economics in Moscow's colleges between 1937 and 1941. Shortly after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Shepilov joined the Soviet People's Militia (Narodnoe Opolcheniye) in July 1941 and was a Political commissar of its Moscow component during the Battle of Moscow in 1941‚Äì1942. In 1942‚Äì1943 he was the political commissar of the 23rd Guard Army and in 1944‚Äì1946 of the 4th Guard Army, ending the war with the rank of Major General. Between May 1945 and February 1946, Shepilov was one of the top Soviet officials in Vienna during the early stages of the Soviet occupation of eastern parts of Austria. Early career In February 1946, Shepilov was appointed deputy head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Soviet Army's Main Political Directorate. On 2 August 1946 he became the head of the propaganda department of the main Communist Party daily Pravda. In mid-1947, the head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Communist Party Central Committee Georgy Aleksandrov and his deputies were subject to public criticism for being insufficiently vigilant and removed from their positions. Shepilov was appointed deputy chief of the Department on 18 September 1947. Since the new department head, Mikhail Suslov, had other responsibilities, Shepilov had almost complete control of the Department's day-to-day operations. One of his first tasks was to assist Zhdanov in disciplining the Soviet Union two greatest living composers, Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev. He selected Shostakovich's Eighth and Ninth Symphonies and Prokofiev's opera War and Peace as the worst examples of what was wrong with Soviet music. While in Moscow, Shepilov ‚Äì famous for his near-eidetic memory, erudition and polished manners (reputedly, he could sing the whole of Tchaikovsky's opera, The Queen of Spadesfrom memory ‚Äì became an expert on Communist ideology and a prot√©g√© of Joseph Stalin's chief of Communist ideology Andrei Zhdanov.Transcripts of frank conversations between Zhdanov and Shepilov in Jonathan Brent and Vladimir Naumov. Stalin's Last Crime: The Plot Against the Jewish Doctors, 1948‚Äì1953, Harper Collins Publishers, 2003, p.79. The appointment of Yuri Zhdanov, Andrei Zhdanov's son, to lead the Propaganda Department's Science Sector on 1 December 1947 put Shepilov in the delicate position of supervising his patron's son. The situation was made even more delicate by the fact that Yuri Zhdanov had just married Joseph Stalin's daughter Svetlana and the fact that Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin's closest advisor at the time, had many enemies in the Soviet leadership. When in April 1948 Shepilov approved Yuri Zhdanov's speech critical of Soviet biologist and Stalin favorite Trofim Lysenko, it started an intense political battle between Andrei Zhdanov on the one hand and his rivals who were using the episode to discredit Zhdanov.See Alexei Kojevnikov. \\"Games of Stalinist Democracy: ideological discussions in the Soviet sciences 1947‚Äì1952\\" in Stalinism: New Directions, ed. Sheila Fitzpatrick, London, Routledge, p.158-159 On 1 July 1948, Zhdanov's main rival, Georgy Malenkov, took over at the Communist Party Secretariat while Zhdanov was sent on a two-month vacation, where he died. Shepilov, however, not only survived this change at the top, but even improved his position and was appointed as the next head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department on 10 July 1948. He also survived the next round of the intra-Party struggle associated with the removal and later execution of the Politburo member Nikolai Voznesensky. However, on 14 July 1949, he was censured by the Central Committee for allowing the Party's main theoretical magazine Bolshevik to publish Voznesensky's book on economics back when Voznesensky was still in power.Current Digest of the Soviet Press, Volume 4, No. 50, 24 January 1953, p. 15. In 1952 Stalin put Shepilov in charge of writing a new Soviet economics textbook based on Stalin's recently published treatise Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR.I primknuvshii k nim Shepilov: pravda o cheloveke uchyonom, voine, politike, eds.

He was made a Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences the same year. While Malenkov argued in favor of producing more consumer goods, Shepilov emphasized the role of heavy and defense industries and characterized Malenkov's position as follows: In February 1955 Malenkov was ousted as prime minister while Shepilov was elected one of the Secretaries of the Central Committee on 12 July 1955. He retained his Pravda post and became a senior Communist theoretician, contributing to Khrushchev's famous \\"secret speech\\" denouncing Stalin at the 20th Party Congress in February 1956.Roger D. Markwick. Rewriting History in Soviet Russia, New York, Palgrave, 2001, p.262, note 146 Minister of Foreign Affairs Even though his field was Marxist-Leninist theory, Shepilov soon began to branch out into foreign policy. In late May 1955 he accompanied Khrushchev and the new Soviet prime minister Nikolai Bulganin to Yugoslavia to end the confrontation between the two countries which had begun in 1947‚Äì1948. According to Veljko Miƒáunoviƒá, then a member of the Yugoslav leadership: :At a lunch with Tito in 1955, Khrushchev several times asked Shepilov to confirm an incident he had just described. \\"Shepilov would remove the table napkin,\\" Micunovic recalled, \\"stand up from the table, and as though he were reporting officially, would reply: 'Just so, Nikita Sergeyevich!' and sit down again. I found such behavior on Shepilov's part most unusual, as I did Khrushchev's in tolerating it\\".Quoted in Taubman, op. cit., p. 312 In July 1955 Shepilov traveled to Egypt for talks with the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser and secured an arms deal, which meant de facto Soviet recognition of Egypt's military regime and paved the way for subsequent Soviet-Egyptian alliance.Rami Ginat. The Soviet Union and Egypt, 1945‚Äì1955, London, Frank Cass and Company Ltd., 1993, pp. 213‚Äì214. It also signaled the Soviet Union's new found flexibility in dealing with non- Communist Third World countries in marked contrast to the intransigence of Stalin's years. On 27 February 1956, after the Soviet Communist Party's 20th Congress, Shepilov was made a candidate (non-voting) member of the Central Committee's Presidium (the Politburo's name in 1952‚Äì1966).USSR: Communist Party: Presidium at www.archontology.org On 1 June 1956, Shepilov replaced Vyacheslav Molotov as the Soviet foreign minister. He gave up his Pravda post, but remained a Secretary of the Central Committee until 24 December.Since Central Committee Secretaries were only appointed and dismissed by infrequent Central Committee plenary meetings, Shepilov formally retained the post until the next meeting In early June 1956 Shepilov went back to Egypt and offered Soviet assistance in building the Aswan Dam, which was eventually accepted after a competing American-World Bank offer was withdrawn in July 1956 in the context of general deterioration of Western-Egyptian relations. On 27 July 1956, one day after Nasser announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, Shepilov met the Egyptian ambassador to the Soviet Union and offered general support for Egypt's position, which Khrushchev made official in his 31 July speech. Although the Soviet Union, as a signatory to the Constantinople Convention of 1888, was invited to the international conference on the Suez issue to be held in London in mid-August, Shepilov at first hesitated to accept the offer. However, once the decision to go was made, he led the Soviet delegation at the conference. Although the conference adopted the American resolution on the internationalization of the Suez Canal 18 votes against 4, Shepilov succeeded in striking an alliance with India, Indonesia and the Dominion of Ceylon as directed by the Soviet leadership. Shepilov represented the Soviet Union at the UN Security Council during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the Suez Crisis in October‚ÄìNovember 1956, although all important political decisions were made by Khrushchev and other top Soviet leaders.Laurent Rucker. \\"The Soviet Union and the Suez Crisis\\", in The 1956 War: Collusion and Rivalry in the Middle East, ed. David Tal, London, Frank Cass Publishers, 2001, pp.67‚Äì82. Post-Ministership and resignation On 14 February 1957 Shepilov was once again made Secretary of the Central CommitteeUSSR: Communist Party: Secretariat at www.archontology.org responsible for Communist ideology and the next day, Andrei Gromyko replaced him as the Soviet foreign minister. In his new capacity, Shepilov oversaw the Second Composers' Congress in March 1957, which re-affirmed the decision of the First Congress (January 1948) to denounce Dmitri Shostakovich and other formalist composers.L.N. Lebedinsky. \\"Rayok: The Music Lesson\\" in Modernism and Music: An Anthropology of Sources, ed. Daniel Albright, University of Chicago, 2004, p.363. Also see Daniel Zhitomirsky. \\"Shostakovich the public and the private: reminiscences, materials, comments\\" in Daugava, 1990, No. 3. An English translation is available online as of March 2006 While delivering his speech to musicians, Shepilov mispronounced the name of the 19th century composer Rimsky-Korsakov, putting the stress on the syllable 'sak', which inspired Shostakovich to compose, privately, a satirical cantata The Anti- formalist Rayok (Peepshow) later that year (published in 1989). Its leading characters, Edinitsyn, Dvoikin, and Troikin (Onesyn, Twokin and Threekin) are transparently caricatures of Stalin, Zhdanov, and Shepilov. Shepilov also denounced jazz and rock music at the Congress, warning against \\"wild cave-man orgies\\" and the \\"explosion of basic instincts and sexual urges\\".Quoted in David Caute. The Dancer Defects: The Struggle for Cultural Supremacy During the Cold War, Oxford University Press, 2003, p.457 Shepilov was the only Central Committee Secretary to oppose Khrushchev in June 1957 when a majority of the Presidium members tried to oust Khrushchev during the so-called Anti- Party Group affair. He reportedly joined the plot at the last moment when Lazar Kaganovich assured him that the plotters had a majority in the PresidiumTaubman. op. cit., p.313. When Khrushchev prevailed at the Central Committee meeting, he was furious over what he saw as Shepilov's betrayal, and denounced him as 'Shepilov-who-joined-them'. Shepilov was ousted from the Central Committee on 29 June 1957 and vilified in the press along with Molotov, Malenkov and Kaganovich, the only 3 other Soviet leaders whose participation in the coup attempt was made public at the time. Shepilov was friend of Marshal Georgy Zhukov and perhaps that was one of the reasons why a few months later Zhukov himself was removed from the office. After losing his Central Committee positions, Shepilov was sent to Kyrgyzstan to head the Economics Institute of the local Academy of Sciences, but was soon demoted to deputy director. In 1960 he was recalled to Moscow, expelled from the Soviet Academy of Sciences and sent to the Soviet State Archive (Gosarkhiv) to work as a clerk, where he remained until his retirement in 1982. Following a second wave of denunciations of the \\"Anti-Party Group\\" at the 22nd Communist Party Congress in November 1961, Shepilov was expelled from the Communist Party on 21 February 1962. In 1976 he was allowed to re-join the Communist Party, but remained on the sidelines. When Khrushchev was ousted as the Soviet leader in October 1964, Shepilov began working on his memoirs, a project which he continued intermittently until circa 1970. His papers were lost after his death at age 89 in Moscow, but were eventually found and published in 2001. As a young man, Marion Barry chose \\"Shepilov\\" as his middle name. It is said that this was done in honor of the Soviet politician, but the reasons have been disputed.Barry, Marion, and Omar Tyree.

He appeared in only four Hollywood films, all with military themes, before he was killed at age 25 in the crash of a small airplane he was piloting. Early life Robert Charles Francis was born in Glendale, California in 1930. His parents, James and Lillian Francis, ran a family pharmacy. He was the youngest by 10 years of three children. Francis was a conscientious student and an excellent skier, so much so that throughout the majority of his teenage years he had aspirations to join the U.S. Olympic team. While tanning himself on a Santa Monica beach, he was spotted by a Hollywood talent scout who persuaded him that with his handsome, all-American looks he should try to become an actor. Francis graduated from Pasadena City College in 1947 and then began to take acting classes, though interrupted by a two-year stint in the U.S. Army. He attended the Batomi Schneider Drama Workshop, where the husband of his acting coach, who worked at Columbia Pictures, helped arrange a screen test for studio head Harry Cohn, who had been looking for a new male lead. Francis' quiet and peaceful manner, in contrast to those of others such as James Dean and Marlon Brando, appealed to Cohn, who was known for demanding obedience from his stars and staff. Although Francis tended to play reserved characters, they were often very rebellious in their approach. On the strength of his screen test, he earned a contract and a lead role in The Caine Mutiny. Francis took a keen interest in aviation in his early twenties, and it was this passion that brought him to the attention of Howard Hughes. The two men frequently went flying together, with Francis most likely to be at the controls of Hughes' planes, though Francis' time in the air was curtailed once Cohn offered him a contract with Columbia. Career Robert Francis as Willie Keith in The Caine MutinyFrancis' motion picture debut was also his most significant role, that of Ensign Willie Keith in The Caine Mutiny (1954), alongside Humphrey Bogart, Fred MacMurray, Van Johnson and Jos√© Ferrer. The film involved a romantic subplot opposite May Wynn. Prior to the film's release, Francis and Wynn were sent on press junkets together by Cohn as a way to showcase the studio's two youngest stars. As a result, gossip magazines reported a romance between the two and even a possible engagement. After The Caine Mutiny, Francis was voted one of Screen World's \\"Promising Personalities of 1954\\". Capitalizing on his rising star, Francis was cast in They Rode West, followed by The Bamboo Prison and John Ford's The Long Gray Line. In Ford's film, Francis was given third billing in the screen credits, indicating that Columbia had been projecting him to become a big star. Although he appeared in only four films in his short life and career, in each one he played a character in the military and received solid reviews. Francis was then loaned to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for Tribute to a Bad Man and was scheduled to travel to the film location in Wyoming to begin filming, a journey he would never make. Death A little more than a week before his departure for the Tribute to a Bad Man film set, Francis piloted a Beechcraft Bonanza belonging to fellow actor Joe Kirkwood, Jr. Also on board were Kirkwood's business partner, George Meyer, 38, a commercial pilot who had flown B-29 bombers in WWII, and actress Ann Russell, 24. Immediately after a 5:00 p.m. takeoff (which eyewitnesses called \\"poor\\") from Lockheed Air Terminal in Burbank, the plane's engine began to sputter and then lost power over Restland Cemetery. Francis managed to avoid crashing into a crowd at nearby Valhalla Memorial Park, but the aircraft stalled and crashed in a parking lot where it burst into flames, killing all occupants. Francis was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park on August 2, 1955.

It was replaced by a new edition in 1932. The book was the result of overtures from the Synod of New York and the Presbytery of Denver. Henry Van Dyke was the chairperson of the committee charged with the publication of the book. The book relied heavily on the liturgical reforms of the Church of Scotland and incorporated much of the liturgical tradition from the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer. It included liturgies for morning and evening worship services as well as ancient forms of Eucharistic prayers based on Eastern Orthodox liturgies. Prayers and texts were written for festivals and seasons of the Liturgical Year, which at the time of publication was not universally accepted in the Presbytery. Various orders were written for Confirmation, Ordination, and other ordinances. For the first time, \\"A Treasury of Prayers,\\" a collection of ancient and contemporary prayers, was included. The prayers were drawn not only from within the Reformed tradition but also from within the Church catholic. One such example was the use of the Prayer of St. John Chrysostom,The Book of Common Worship of 1906, p. 26 a remarkable departure from the Reformed principles and an intense look into the pre-denominational past. Finally, the book included an extensive selection from Psalms and Canticles; the latter's titles were given in Latin (Magnificat; Nunc Dimittis, Te Deum laudamus etc.), a significant departure from the Reformed tradition. Many Presbyterians were angered by what they felt was a loss of liberty in worship and criticized \\"canned prayers.\\" In the General Assembly meeting to approve the book, one commissioner threw the book across the room and said, \\"Faugh! It smells of priestcraft.\\" Another speaker responded, \\"This is not van Dyke's prayer book. It belongs to every member of the committee you appointed. It is not a liturgy. It's not a ritual. It does not contain 'canned' prayers. It contains great live prayers of our fathers. Are you going to tell the man who wants to use this book that he can't have it?\\" In the end, the book was published but not fully embraced. However, it paved the way for a continuing tradition of liberty in Presbyterian worship in America, balanced with written resources for worship.

The plot concerns an elderly couple (Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi) who are forced to separate when they lose their house and none of their five children will take both parents. The film was written by Vi√±a Delmar, from a play by Helen and Noah Leary, which was in turn based on the novel The Years Are So Long by advice columnist Josephine Lawrence. McCarey believed that it was his finest film. When he accepted his Academy Award for Best Director for The Awful Truth, which was released the same year, he said, \\"Thanks, but you gave it to me for the wrong picture.\\" In 2010, it was selected for preservation by the United States Library of Congress's National Film Registry. Plot Barkley \\"Bark\\" (Victor Moore) and Lucy Cooper (Beulah Bondi) are an elderly couple who lose their home to foreclosure, as Barkley has been unable to find employment because of his age. They summon four of their five children‚Äîthe fifth lives thousands of miles away in California‚Äîto break the news and decide where they will live until they can get back on their feet. Only one of the children, Nell (Minna Gombell), has enough space for both, but she asks for three months to talk her husband into the idea. In the meantime, the temporary solution is for the parents to split up and each live with a different child. The two burdened families soon come to find their parents' presence bothersome. Nell's efforts to talk her husband into helping are half-hearted and achieve no success, and she reneges on her promise to eventually take them. While Barkley continues looking for work to allow him and his wife to live independently again, he has little or no prospect of success. When Lucy continues to speak optimistically of the day that he will find work, her teenage granddaughter bluntly advises her to \\"face facts\\" that it will never happen because of his age. Lucy's sad reply is to say that \\"facing facts\\" is easy for a carefree 17-year-old girl, but that at Lucy's age, the only fun left is \\"pretending that there ain't any facts to face ... so would you mind if I just kind of went on pretending?\\" With no end in sight to the uncomfortable living situations, both host families look for a way to get the parent they are hosting out of their house. When Barkley catches a cold, his daughter Cora (Elisabeth Risdon) seizes upon it as a pretext to assert that his health demands a milder climate, thus necessitating that he move to California to live with his daughter Addie. Meanwhile, son George (Thomas Mitchell) and his wife Anita (Fay Bainter) begin planning to move Lucy into a retirement home. Lucy accidentally finds out about their plans, but rather than force George into the awkward position of breaking the news to her, she goes to him first and claims that she wants to move into the home. Meanwhile, Barkley resigns himself to his fate of having to move thousands of miles away, though he too is entirely aware of his daughter's true motivation. On the day Barkley is to depart by train, he and Lucy make plans to go out and spend one last afternoon together before having a farewell dinner with the four children. They have a fantastic time strolling around the city and reminiscing about their happy years together, even visiting the same hotel in which they had stayed on their honeymoon 50 years prior. Their day is made so pleasant partly because of the kindness of people they encounter, who, although strangers, seem to find them a charming couple, to genuinely enjoy their company, and to treat them with deference and respect‚Äîin stark contrast to the treatment the two are receiving from their children. Eventually Barkley and Lucy decide to continue their wonderful day by skipping the farewell dinner and dining at the hotel instead; when Barkley informs their daughter with a blunt phone call, it prompts introspection among the four children. Son Robert (Ray Meyer) suggests that each of the children has always known that collectively they are \\"probably the most good-for-nothing bunch of kids that were ever raised, but it didn't bother us much until we found out that Pop knew it too.\\" George notes that it is now so late in the evening that they won't even have time to meet their parents at the train station to send off their father. He says that he deliberately let the time pass until it was too late because he figured their parents would prefer to be alone. Nell objects that if they don't go to the station, their parents \\"will think we're terrible,\\" to which George matter-of-factly replies, \\"Aren't we?\\" At the train station, Lucy and Barkley say their farewells to one another. On the surface, their conversation echoes Lucy's comments to her granddaughter about preferring to pretend, rather than facing facts. Barkley tells Lucy that he will find a job in California and quickly send for her; Lucy replies that she is sure he will do so. They then offer each other a truly final goodbye, saying that they are doing so \\"just in case\\" they do not see each other again because \\"anything could happen.\\" Each makes a heartfelt statement reaffirming their lifelong love, in what seems an unspoken acknowledgment that it is almost certainly their final moment together. Barkley boards the train, and Lucy and he acknowledge each other and wave through the closed window as the train pulls away. The film ends with a somber Lucy turning from the scene. A Let Me Call You Sweetheart instrumental plays into the credits.

Greene noted that the overall effect the audience receives is \\"a sense of misery and inhumanity [] left vibrating in the nerves\\", and commented that the description from Paramount gave a distinctly different expectation of the actual film. (reprinted in: ) Orson Welles said of Make Way for Tomorrow, \\"It would make a stone cry,\\" and rhapsodized about his enthusiasm for the film in his book-length series of interviews with Peter Bogdanovich, This Is Orson Welles. In Newsweek magazine, famed documentary filmmaker Errol Morris named it his #1 film, stating \\"The most depressing movie ever made, providing reassurance that everything will definitely end badly.\\" Make Way for Tomorrow also earned good reviews when originally released in Japan, where it was seen by screenwriter Kogo Noda. Years later, it provided an inspiration for the script of Tokyo Story (1953), written by Noda and director Yasujir≈ç Ozu. Roger Ebert added this film to his \\"Great Movies\\" list on February 11, 2010, writing: > \\"Make Way for Tomorrow\\" (1937) is a nearly-forgotten American film made in > the Depression ... The great final arc of \\"Make Way for Tomorrow\\" is > beautiful and heartbreaking. It's easy to imagine it being sentimentalized > by a studio executive, being made more upbeat for the audience. That's not > McCarey. What happens is wonderful and very sad. Everything depends on the > performances. The film is now part of the Criterion Collection, describing it as \\"... one of the great unsung Hollywood masterpieces, an enormously moving Depression-era depiction of the frustrations of family, aging, and the generation gap ... Make Way for Tomorrow is among American cinema's purest tearjerkers, all the way to its unflinching ending, which McCarey refused to change despite studio pressure. The 2003 Indian film Baghban was an unofficial adaptation of Make Way for Tomorrow. In 2010, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".

Amador was the primary on-land site, lying below the Bridge of the Americas. Grant consisted of a series of islands lying just offshore, some connected to Amador via a causeway. Fort Sherman was the corresponding base on the Atlantic (northern) side. All of the forts were turned over to the Republic of Panama in 1999, and the area is now a major tourist attraction. History The offshore islands had always been considered excellent defensive grounds and were long visited by English pirates. Sir Francis Drake, Captain Cook, and Henry Morgan all used Taboga and Perico as refuges after raiding Spanish galleons. It was here that then-Captain Ulysses S. Grant ended his cross- Panama march in 1852. During the construction of the Panama Canal, notably the Culebra Cut, waste material was dumped in a mangrove bush then known as the \\"Balboa dump\\". As the work progressed, the dump was backfilled to create a large breakwater, which was later extended to the nearest of the offshore islands, Naos. This work was completed in 1912, and the military reservations were given their official names that year. Fort Amador is named for Manuel Amador Guerrero, the first president of Panama, while Fort Grant was named to commemorate Grant's earlier crossing to that point. The two forts initially claimed only about of land, but this expanded over the years to over 344. Amador was the primary infantry and support area, and grew to include a rather prominent \\"tank farm\\" for fuel storage. Grant was used primarily for naval defence, and included a number of large batteries on the various islands. To supply them, the causeway was extended to connect from Naos to the other nearby islands, Culebra, Perico, and Flamenco, all of which had batteries of various sizes. Grant also included the nearby unconnected islands of San Jose, Panamarca, Changarmi, Tortolita, Torola, Taboga, Cocovieceta, Cocovi, and Venado. Armament Fort Amador was initially armed with two batteries, each of two six inch disappearing guns. Batteries Birnie and Snith, begun in 1913, were completed in 1917. They remained in service until 1943, when the guns were removed, and the structures buried. The area was then used for housing.

From Khorsabad, Iraq. Circa 710 BCE. On display at the Iraq Museum Archaeological looting in Iraq took place since at least the late 19th century. The chaos following war provided the opportunity to pillage everything that was not nailed down. There were also attempts to protect the sites such as the period between April 8, 2003, when the staff vacated the National Museum of Iraq and April 16, 2003, when US forces arrived in sufficient numbers to \\"restore some semblance of order.\\" Some 15,000 cultural artifacts disappeared in that time. Over the years approximately 14,800 were recovered from within and outside Iraq and taken under the protection of the Iraqi government. Early history Looting of ancient artifacts has a long tradition. As early as 1884, laws passed in Mesopotamia about moving and destroying antiquities. By the end of World War I, British-administrated Mesopotamia created protections for archaeological sites where looting was beginning to become a problem. They established an absolute prohibition on exporting antiquities. The British Museum was responsible for the sites and museums across Iraq during this time period. Gertrude Bell, well known for drawing the Iraq borders, excavated many sites around Iraq and created what is now the National Museum of Iraq. By the mid 1920s the black market for antiquities was growing and looting began in all sites where antiquities could be found. After Iraq gaining independence from Britain, the absolute ban on antiquity exports was lifted. Until the mid 1970s Iraq was one of very few countries to not prohibit external trade in antiquities. This made Iraq attractive to looters and black market collectors from around the globe. The result of the Gulf War was that at least 4000 artifacts were looted from Iraq sites. Uprisings that followed the war also resulted in 9 of 13 regional museums being looted and burned. Failure to protect under Ba'athist Iraq  Upon becoming president in 1979, Saddam Hussein treasured his national heritage immensely and acted to defend these sites and the artifacts within them. He believed that the past of Iraq was important to his national campaign and his regime actually doubled the national budget for archaeology and heritage creating museums and protecting sites all over Iraq. It wasn't until his Ba'ath Party was under pressure in the 1990s that looting become a large problem once again for Iraq. By 2000 looting had become so rampant that the workers of the sites were even looting their own workplaces. With the fall of Saddam's government in 2003, archaeological sites were left completely open and looting became an even greater problem. Some sites, such as Ur and Nippur, were officially protected by US and Coalition forces. Before the start of the Iraq War, the US government created a post-war plan for Iraq. According to Lawrence Rothfield, former director of the Cultural Policy Center at the University of Chicago and associate professor of English and comparative literature, this looting of the National Museum of Iraq and of hundreds of archaeological sites around the country was not prevented. At the time of war planning it was Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld who decided on a fast invasion with fewer troops, resulting in inadequate protection of buildings and cultural sites. American troops and commanders did not prioritize security for cultural sites around Iraq. Peacekeeping was seen as a lesser job than physically fighting in combat and President Bush's suspension of former president Clinton's policies for peacekeeping not only backed up this thought but also made the US's duties to restore public order unclear. American troops in Iraq didn't trust Iraqi power of any kind meaning that instead of using and training Iraqi police, the US military took matters of security and policing into their own hands. Essentially the US would act as peacekeepers to train a national army and police force. Special Forces teams would work with regional warlords to keep control of their territories. Allowing warlords to police their own areas has been credited with being a disastrous plan for the archaeological sites in particular. Arthur Houghton had an interest and some expertise in cultural heritage and was one of the first to wonder what the pre-war plan was for Iraqi culture. He had worked in the State Department as a Foreign Service officer, as an international policy analyst for the White house and also served at an acting curator for the Getty Museum. In late spring 2002, Houghton was approached by Ashton Hawkins, former Executive Vice President and Counsel to the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, and was asked to find out what was being done by officials to secure heritage sites in the upcoming war in Iraq. Houghton could find no one designated with the task of protection and preservation of culture in Iraq. There had been a secret Future of Iraq Project since October 2001, with clearance from the Pentagon. However, even under this Project no specific person had taken up responsibility of culture. Even archaeological organizations in the US hadn't noticed the issue until late 2002. Likewise when the US Agency for Cultural Development (USAID) met with estimated 150 NGO's not one brought up protection of cultural heritage. UNESCO had in fact, after the Gulf War in 1991, attempted to go into Iraq and assess the damage to cultural sites but they were not allowed to enter the country. UNESCO then focused, for the next decade, on reconstruction after the fact rather than prevention measures. Within the US military, Civil Affairs (CA) forces were important to the protection of culture and, as they were mostly reservists, included experts in a variety of areas including archaeology. The plan was to spread the expertise among fighting forces in order to warn them of cultural sites in the area. However, CA was left out of pre-war planning until January 2003, when it was too late to be of any real significant help. The CA had to prioritize the small amount of CA troops to what they thought was necessary, which inevitably wasn't culture. The CA did, however, pull the only two archaeologists in Civil Affairs to be on a culture team, Maj. Chris Varhola and Capt. William Sumner. These two men, however, in the end were sent to other places when the conflict began. Varhola was needed to prepare for the refugee crises that never arrived and Sumner was reassigned to guard a zoo after pushing his advisor too hard on antiquities issues. Any protection of culture, sites or buildings was stopped due to the priorities of other matters. Essentially no one who had archaeological expertise was senior enough to get anything done. Another branch of the US government that had interest in culture was the Foreign Area Offices (FAO). Unfortunately though, they were focused on customs and attitudes rather than archaeological sites. Something that was accomplished was the creation of a no-strike list created by Maj. Varhola just like two archaeologists before him had done during the 1991 Gulf War which had a great outcome of saving antiquities from bombing. One piece of international law that is important for this conflict is the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, this Convention states that parties in conflict must \\"under take to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any act of vandalism directed against, cultural property.\\" This provision was constructed for the parties actually in combat within the war and not civilians within their own state. As the upcoming years would prove, there are exceptions to this convention and they would result in Americans firing on the Iraq National Museum. By fall 2002, post-war planning was sporadic and improvised. The cultural planning aspect needed to have leadership that it never got. Deputy Assistant under the Security of Defense, Joseph Collins, recalls some forces spent more time working on projects that ended up not being needed like a refugee crises plan. He says he can't remember if there was even an organizational plans to solve specific issues. The first known effort by cultural interests to contact US officials was October 2002. After a meeting of powerful players in culture, Houghton sent a letter asking for departments to tell forces to avoid damaging monuments, soldiers were to respect the integrity of sites, and lastly to work quickly to get the antiquities services in Iraq up and running again. Following this, the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) also sent a similar letter to the Pentagon in December 2002 asking for governments to take action to prevent looting in the aftermath of the war. As 2002 came to an end the media and government were only broadcasting the good done by the troops in not destroying cultural heritage themselves but not on the looting done by people in Iraq and the Americans duty to protect the antiquities.  Large scale looting  The upper surface of Yasin Tepe ancient mound, innumerable looters' pits. Sulaymaniyah Governorate, Iraqi Kurdistan. Most of these were dug in the 1990s. A looter's pit (left) at the ancient Sumerian city of Kish, Iraq. Fragments of pottery (right) are scattered near the pit When the looting of the National Iraq Museum became known, experts from around the globe started planning to remedy the situation. McGuire Gibson, one of the leading archaeologists and experts on Mesopotamia explained to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) that the looted museum artifacts were only a small part of what archaeological digs around the country held. Perhaps 25 thousand of an estimated half million sites were registered. ORHA had no resources to address this problem. Gibson had suggested helicopter surveys to determine the scale of looted sites. By April 24, 2003, looting had taken place in Umma, Umm al-Hafriyat, Umm al-Aqarib, Bismaya, Larsa, and Bad-tibira, most of were unguarded. Most looting was by workers once employed by the now disbanded State Board of Antiquities and Heritage. A local tribe was guarding the World Heritage Site of Hatra although others were unsupervised. By May 2003, international work began on the already looted museum but not on other sites. The US military conducted a raid in May on Umma where they found hundreds of trenches with many looters all over the site. On May 7, the Bush Administration replaced Gen. Jay Garner with L. Paul Bremer who was given more power and banned high-ranking Ba'ath Party members from government jobs and disbanded the remains of the Iraqi army. Any guards at archeological sites were unpaid for months and they were not allowed to carry guns. Now, instead of dealing with civilian looters, these unarmed guards were dealing with large mobs of armed people. At the end of May 2003, it finally became clear how badly the sites were looted when a trip sponsored by National Geographic went out to assess the damage. There was a northern and southern team to assess the post-conflict damage by land. They found the famous sites such as Babylon, Hatra, Nimrud and Ur were under US military control. Lesser known sites were completely unguarded and the responsible Civil Affairs teams didn't even know where they were. Every place the National Geographic team saw, except one that was guarded by barbed wire, had been damaged. Gibson was part of the northern National Geographic team and he sent a report to the White House science advisor John Marburger. Other archeological experts in both the US and Britain were waiting for invitations to go to Iraq and help. After Gibson's report they were given invitations to create a team in Iraq. Early July 2003, UNESCO revealed that looting was still happening at sites across the country. Other military services such as Japanese and Dutch troops offered assistance but were ignored. On July 8, a new security guard force known as the Iraqi Facility Protection Service (FPS) was established to protect sites all around the country in co-operation with the US military. A week later, the State Department announced it was forming a group to assist in the rebuilding of Iraq's cultural heritage. These announcements had no effect on the looting and illegal export of artifacts. McGuire Gibson on September 11, 2003, wrote to a military geographer, \\"The continuing destruction of sites all over southern Iraq and the theft of thousands of artifacts every week, with no visible effort on part of the US authorities, makes the question of ethical behaviour by museums pointless. Your unit of the Pentagon is capable of demonstrating the location and expansion of illegal digging. Are you at least doing that much?\\" Known recoveries Recovered artifacts on display in late 2008 It is impossible to discover exactly how much destruction to archeological sites has happened since 2003. Archeologist Elizabeth Stone purchased satellite images of the seven thousand square kilometers in Iraq that contain many known sites. She counted 1,837 new holes by comparing 2001‚Äì2002 with 2003 images. Looters concentrated on sites that had the most marketable artifacts. Estimates of the number of looted artifacts from 2003 to 2005 are from 400,000 to 600,000 items. This number is 30-40 times greater than the number of artifacts stolen from the museum. Britain alone between 2004 and 2006 seized 3-4 tons of plundered artifacts. Some artifacts have been recovered by accident. An archeologist was watching a home decorating show when he saw a 2nd-century stone head from Hatra sitting on the decorator's mantle. The illegal black market for goods became so saturated that prices in the market were going down after 2003 according to an antiquities researcher specializing in illicit dealings. Revenue from looted antiquities is estimated by the Archeological Institute of America to amount to between $10 to $20 million annually. Terrorist and rebel groups have a long history of using stolen artifacts to finance their operations. By the end of 2003, 1,900 Iraqi antiquities had been confiscated from bordering countries: 1,450 in Jordan, 36 in Syria, 38 in Kuwait and 18 in Saudi Arabia. U.S. Marine Corps reservist Matthew Boulay witnessed illicit trading even on military bases Flea markets authorized by the camp commanders included a booth with antiquities for $20, $40 or $100 each. Boulay asked Gibson and was told that these artifacts were real. Gibson asked Boulay to ask the base commander to stop these sales. When Boulay informed his platoon commander he got a \\"cease and desist\\" order forbidding any more emails about the issue to anyone. Other institutes from America and around the world have contributed to protect sites in Iraq. The US started teaching military personnel headed for Iraq the importance of cultural heritage and site preservation. Donny George who was an employee at the Iraq National Museum was appointed to Director of Museums in 2004, and by summer 2006, a force of 1,400 guards were situated at sites around the country. Sites affected *Adab ‚Äì an ancient city plagued by hundreds of looters. * Babylon ‚Äì saw the construction of \\"a 150-hectare camp for 2,000 troops.

Babylon is being rendered archaeologically barren\\".(Simon Jenkins in The Guardian, 8 June 2007). * Hatra ‚Äì looters with stonecutters have stolen elements of friezes and reliefs straight off the ancient architecture here. * Isin ‚Äì over two hundred looters' pits are organized around the former site of the Temple of Gula; countless artifacts have been removed from the site here, including innumerable cuneiform tablets, cylinder seals, and votive tablets, some of which could sell for as much as $30,000. * Nimrud ‚Äì home of the palace of Assurnasirpal II and described by the Old Testament as the \\"principal city\\" of Assyria, Nimrud is one of the few sites that is militarily protected. However, weeks before the arrival of the site's US guards, looters attacked the friezes and statues with stonecutting tools, stealing images distinctly belonging to Nimrud, and thus unmistakenly known to any potential buyers to be stolen; the items have been sold, presumably, nevertheless. Those few looters that managed to break into this site despite its protection have given every indication that they know precisely what they are looking for, where to find it, and how to get at it. Like many looters throughout Iraq and across the world, they have presumably been hired to obtain specific images; this separates them from the looters who dig up and sell whatever they can find. * Nineveh ‚Äì one of the more thoroughly researched sites, experts have little difficulty identifying objects stolen from Nineveh. The site was severely looted and damaged nevertheless after the first Gulf War, and chunks of its unique and ancient friezes have appeared on the European and American art markets. * Nippur ‚Äì the great ziggurat here has only three major looters' pits cut into it, which are the first in over forty years of valuable research and excavation. * Umma ‚Äì looters descended upon the site as soon as Coalition bombing began; the site is now pockmarked with hundreds of ditches and pits. When archaeologists \\"tried to remove vulnerable carvings from the ancient city of Umma to Baghdad, they found gangs of looters already in place with bulldozers, dump trucks and AK47s\\". * Ur ‚Äì one of the few sites protected by a US military presence. According to Simon Jenkins, \\"its walls are pockmarked with wartime shrapnel and a blockhouse is being built over an adjacent archaeological site\\".

The station was originally built on the west side of Station Road, to the north of the running line. The goods yard was to the north of the station and mostly accessed via a turntable. The railway changed to standard gauge in 1847. In 1900 the station was relocated to the other side of the running line and to the other side of Station Road, the goods yard remained where it was and expanded into some of the space the station had used, by this time the access became the usual set of points. The goods yard was able to accommodate most types of goods including live stock and was equipped with a three-ton crane.

In his native Spanish, as well as in English and some other languages, he is often referred to by the shorter form of his name, Leonardo Padura. He has written screenplays, two books of short stories, and a series of detective novels translated into 10 languages. In 2012, Padura was awarded the National Prize for Literature, Cuba's national literary award and the most important award of its kind. In 2015, he was awarded the Premio Principe de Asturias de las Letras of Spain, one of the most important literary prizes in the Spanish-speaking world and usually considered as the Iberoamerican Nobel Prize.  Life and career  Padura, who was born in Havana, took a degree in Latin American literature at the University of Havana. In 1980 he first came to prominence as an investigative journalist in a literary magazine called Caim√°n Barbudo, a well-established publication that is still published today. He became known as an essayist and a writer of screenplays and in particular, detective novels. He wrote his first short novel between 1983 and 1984. Titled Fiebre de caballos (Horse Fever), it was basically a love story. During the next six years, he continued to work as a journalist, reporting on a wide range of cultural and historical topics. However, around this time he began to write his first novel featuring police officer Mario Conde. While he was writing it, Padura realised how fundamental his years as a journalist were to his development as a writer. Firstly it gave him a whole new experience of the country, and secondly, it changed his style with respect to his first book. In 2013, France named him a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Padura still lives and writes in his native city of Havana. > \\"In one of his essays entitled 'I would like to be Paul Auster,' Padura > complains that he would love not to be constantly asked about politics in > his country and why he continues living there.

Collectively titled Las cuatro estaciones (The four seasons), they are sometimes called The Havana Quartet in their English translations. Conde is a cop who would rather be a writer, and admits to feelings of \\"solidarity with writers, crazy people, and drunkards\\". These books are set respectively in winter, spring, summer and autumn (Vientos de cuaresma literally means \\"Lenten Winds\\" and Paisaje de oto√±o, \\"Autumn landscape\\"): *Pasado perfecto (1991, translated as Havana Blue, 2007) *Vientos de cuaresma (1994, translated as Havana Gold, 2008) *M√°scaras (1997, translated as Havana Red, 2005) *Paisaje de oto√±o (1998, translated as Havana Black, 2006) The four books were adapted as four Spanish language television films, which have been released in a group with English subtitles as the Netflix mini-series Four Seasons in Havana. They star Cuban actor Jorge Perugorr√≠a and were produced by Tornasol Film. An English-language remake named Havana Quartet was considered by Starz, with Antonio Banderas tagged to act as Conde, but it did not proceed beyond the development stage. BBC Radio broadcast dramatizations of the four stories in 2014. Paisaje de oto√±o won the 1998 Premio Hammett of the Asociaci√≥n Internacional de Escritores Policiacos (International Association of Crime Writers). This prize should not be confused with the similarly named Hammett Prize given by the North American branch of the organization, which is restricted to United States and Canadian authors. Padura has published two subsequent books featuring Conde, the novella Adi√≥s Hemingway (Padura‚Äôs first book to be translated into English, in 2005), and a recent novel La neblina del ayer (The Fog of Yesterday, published in English as Havana Fever). The Havana-Cultura website comments on the similarities and differences between Padura and Hemingway, and how they might explain Padura's decision to feature the expatriate American in Adi√≥s Hemingway. =Other works= Padura's historical novel El hombre que amaba a los perros (The Man Who Loved Dogs) deals with the murder of Leon Trotsky and the man who assassinated him, Ramon Mercader. At almost 600 pages, it is his most accomplished work and the result of more than five years of meticulous historical research. The novel, published in September 2009, attracted a lot of publicity mainly because of its political theme. The novel centres \\"on Stalin‚Äôs murderous obsession with Leon Trotsky, an intellectual architect of the Russian Revolution and the founder of the Red Army\\", and considers \\"how revolutionary utopias devolve into totalitarian dystopias.\\" Padura's books are also available in French (including all the books featuring Conde), Italian, Portuguese, German, Greek, and Danish.

Released direct-to-video, the film is the third installment of I Know What You Did Last Summer franchise, but does not have any of the cast returning from the first two installments, thus making it a stand alone sequel. The film instead takes the basic myth of the series and starts it over with a new set of characters. I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer was released on DVD on August 15, 2006 and has grossed in excess of $20 million. Plot In 2005, Amber Williams, her boyfriend Colby Patterson and their friends Zoe, Roger, and P.J. stage a prank at the town carnival where Roger impersonates the \\"Fisherman\\" killer. Afterward, everyone sees P.J.'s body impaled on a tractor smokestack instead of mattresses that were supposed to break his fall. The public believes the Fisherman is behind it, and the friends burn the evidence and make a pact to keep it secret. One year later, Amber returns to town to discover that Colby never left to pursue his scholarship. She goes up to the mountains where she encounters one of the officers who witnessed the accident, Deputy Haffner (K.C. Clyde). Later that night, Amber awakens to 50 text messages reading \\"I know what you did last summer\\". She drives to Zoe's shack where Zoe allows Amber to sleep for the night. The next day they find Roger and Colby, but they angrily dismiss them when told about the messages. Amber is attacked on a ski-lift by someone wielding the hook. A drunken Roger contemplates suicide with the hook from the prank. When he investigates a noise, he is attacked and killed by the Fisherman. Colby is also attacked while swimming. They go to warn Roger and find him dead along with a suicide note and the hook. Deputy Haffner shows up and gets their statements. Afterwards, they return to Amber's house to find pictures of them from the high school yearbook sliced up and stuck to the wall reading \\"SOON\\". They all stay at Zoe's place and find Lance, P.J.'s cousin, outside. He shows them a message engraved on his motorbike. The night of Zoe's concert, after her performance, she, Amber and Lance are attacked by the Fisherman. Zoe is stabbed and thrown over a balcony to her death. P.J's dad, the sheriff, comes in, only to be killed as well. The Fisherman then attacks Colby in a kitchen and hooks him in the mouth, killing him. Outside, Amber and Lance run into Deputy Haffner, who reveals that Roger told him about the accident. The Fisherman then advances towards Haffner and impales him on a forklift. Amber and Lance get into a car and run the fisherman down. He gets up and is revealed to be the undead Ben Willis, the man who committed the original murders 8 years ago. Willis attacks them, but is cut with a hook by Amber and disappears. Amber and Lance go to face Willis, deducing that the hook will hurt him. They are chased into a warehouse. Amber then fights Willis and eventually stabs him in the head, and pushes him into a snow blower driven by Lance, killing Willis. A year later, Amber is driving across the desert when a tire blows out. She stops the car, and loses reception. Willis appears behind her and she screams, ending the film with a slicing sound of the hook, leaving her fate unknown.

It was superseded by a new edition in 1946. Henry van Dyke, who chaired the committee that composed The Book of Common Worship of 1906, began in 1928 calling on General Assembly to revise the book. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of 1929 constituted a committee, again chaired by van Dyke. During the course of their work, van Dyke addressed the critics of the 1906 book: \\"We can see no force in the thoughtless opposition of such a book which is represented by the rather irreverent phrase, 'canned prayers.' The Bible and the service books of Calvin, Knox and the other reformers, all contain written forms of prayer. All our hymns are written. Yet no one is foolish and crude enough to protest against 'canned praise.' The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man is acceptable though it be written.\\" The 1932 book was a revision and an expansion of the 1906 book, thus becoming the second liturgical book of the Presbyterian Church (USA). Texts for additional festivals and seasons were added. A rudimentary lectionary was included. When presented to the 1931 General Assembly, there were no speeches against 'canned prayers' and the book was unanimously approved. The work was published in 1932.

It was one of the earliest types of plough used in Hebridean crofting, and consisted of a small crooked piece of wood with an iron tip at one end and a top-mounted handle or stilt (thus, a single-stilted plough). Its curving coulter and sock were both made of iron. It could be drawn by up to four horses, although one or two were more usual. The design of the crann-nan-gad was specifically related to the environmental conditions of Hebridean farms, facilitating paring and skimming of the shallow soil. The plough's tip could run along the ground, which enabled its user to lift it over large stones embedded in the earth. It was widely used in the larger Hebridean islands, spreading from Harris to Lewis in the mid-18th century. In addition to Lewis and Harris, it was also used on the Uists and Barra. Its use survived into the 20th century in the parish of Barvas on Lewis. A single example of the crann-nan-gad is preserved in the collections of the National Museum of Scotland.

Lovecraft was an American psychedelic rock band, formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1967 and named after the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. Much of the band's music was possessed of a haunting, eerie ambience, and consisted of material that was inspired by the macabre writings of the author whose name they had adopted. Combining elements of psychedelia and folk rock, the band's sound was marked by the striking vocal harmonies of ex-folk singer George Edwards and the classically trained Dave Michaels. In addition, Michaels' multi-instrumentalist abilities on organ, piano, harpsichord, clarinet and recorder provided the band with a richer sonic palette than many of their contemporaries. The band was signed to Philips Records in 1967 and released its first single, \\"Anyway That You Want Me\\", in the early part of that year. Their first album, H. P. Lovecraft, followed in late 1967 and included what is arguably the band's best-known song, \\"The White Ship\\". The band then relocated to San Francisco, California, where they became a frequent attraction at various San Francisco Bay Area venues, including The Fillmore and the Winterland Ballroom. In 1968, a second album, H. P. Lovecraft II, appeared, but the group disbanded in early 1969. Edwards and fellow original member Michael Tegza subsequently formed a new line-up of the band with the shortened name of Lovecraft, although Edwards left this new group before the first album was recorded. This second incarnation of the band released the Valley of the Moon album in 1970 and, after a further name change to Love Craft, the We Love You Whoever You Are album in 1975. History =Formation and first album= The first line-up of H. P. Lovecraft was formed when the ex-folk singer George Edwards, who was working as an in-house session vocalist for Dunwich Records at the time, entered the studio to record a cover version of Chip Taylor's \\"Anyway That You Want Me\\" (a song that had recently been a UK hit for the Troggs). Edwards had previously been a folk troubadour in Chicago, California, and Florida, and had released a commercially unsuccessful cover of the Beatles' \\"Norwegian Wood\\" on Dunwich in 1966. He had also recorded a cover version of Bob Dylan's \\"Quit Your Low Down Ways\\" for the label, but this remained unreleased until the early 1970s. For the \\"Anyway That You Want Me\\" session, Edwards was backed by members of the Chicago band the Rovin' Kind and was also joined by Dave Michaels, a classically trained singer and multi- instrumentalist with a four-octave voice, who Edwards had met while playing in a lounge jazz trio at a local Holiday Inn. \\"Anyway That You Want Me\\" was coupled with \\"It's All Over for You\\", a George Edwards solo outtake from the previous year, and released as a single under the moniker of H. P. Lovecraft in early 1967 by the Mercury Records' subsidiary Philips. The decision to release the single as H. P. Lovecraft, rather than as a George Edwards solo release, was made by Dunwich founders Bill Traut and George Badonsky, who were both fans of the literary works of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft and had, in fact, named Dunwich Records after Lovecraft's short story \\"The Dunwich Horror\\". Edwards and Michaels were both enthusiastic about the band name and after permission from Lovecraft's estate was secured, the duo set about recruiting other musicians to form a permanent line-up of the band. Auditions were held in March 1967, which resulted in the recruitment of Tony Cavallari (lead guitar), Mike Tegza (drums), and Tom Skidmore (bass). Skidmore soon departed the band, however, and was replaced by Jerry McGeorge, who had previously been a guitarist for Chicago band the Shadows of Knight. McGeorge had seen H. P. Lovecraft perform a number of times at a Chicago dance club called The Cellar and although he considered himself primarily a guitarist, he accepted Edwards' offer to join the group as their new bassist. With Michaels and Edwards as the creative driving forces behind the group, H. P. Lovecraft began to develop a blend of folk rock and psychedelia, with a repertoire that encompassed contemporary and traditional folk songs and some self-penned material. The band's sound was highlighted by the oddly striking harmony work that resulted from the juxtaposition of Edwards' folk-influenced singing and Michaels' operatic vocal phrasing, a blend that was influenced by folk singer Fred Neil's work with Vince Martin. The band's music was made all the more unique by Michaels' virtuosity on organ, piano, harpsichord, clarinet, and recorder, which gave H. P. Lovecraft a much wider range of sounds and timbres than many of their contemporaries. In late 1967, the band recorded and released their debut album for Philips, H. P. Lovecraft. A cover of the traditional song \\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" was issued just ahead of the album as a single in September 1967, but it failed to chart. The album itself was released some weeks later and although it also failed to reach the U.S. charts, it sold reasonably well over time. Featuring a nine-piece orchestra and songs that exhibited a wide-ranging stylistic variety, H. P. Lovecraft was possessed of a haunting, eerie ambiance that lived up to the band's intention of making music inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's \\"macabre tales and poems of Earth populated by another race\\" (to quote the LP's back cover). While the album did include a smattering of self-penned material, including the jazzy \\"That's How Much I Love You, Baby (More or Less)\\" and the vaudeville psychedelia of \\"The Time Machine\\", the majority of H. P. Lovecraft consisted of cover versions. Among these covers were Dino Valente's hippie anthem \\"Get Together\\", Randy Newman's \\"I've Been Wrong Before\\", Travis Edmonson's \\"The Drifter\\", and the Fred Neil compositions \\"That's The Bag I'm In\\" and \\"Country Boy & Bleeker Street\\". The centerpiece of the album, however, was the Edwards‚ÄîMichaels‚ÄîCavallari composition \\"The White Ship\\", which was based on author H. P. Lovecraft's short story \\"The White Ship\\". The six-and-a-half- minute opus, which featured baroque harpsichord passages, droning feedback, somber harmonies, and the chiming of a genuine 1811 ship's bell, has been described by music historian Richie Unterberger as having a \\"wavering, foggy beauty, with some of Michaels' eeriest keyboards.\\" The song became something of an underground FM radio favorite and was also issued in an edited form as a single, although it failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100. =Relocation and second album= H. P. Lovecraft embarked on their first tour of the West Coast in late 1967, establishing themselves as a live favorite with the hippies of San Francisco and Los Angeles. In November 1967, Billboard magazine reported that the H. P. Lovecraft album had become something of an underground hit in San Francisco and had already sold 1,100 copies there. In San Francisco the band were championed by concert promoter Bill Graham and this led to appearances at such high-profile venues as The Fillmore and the Winterland Ballroom. After returning to Chicago briefly, the group embarked on an early 1968 East Coast tour, appearing at the Boston Tea Party, Philadelphia's Electric Factory, and concluding with an aborted engagement at New York's Cafe Au Go Go alongside Al Kooper's Blood, Sweat & Tears. These obligations fulfilled, the group relocated to Marin County, California permanently in mid- February 1968 in an attempt to advance their careers. Notable post-relocation performances were at the Fillmore and Winterland with Traffic, Salt Lake City's Utah State Fairgrounds Coliseum with Buffalo Springfield and the Youngbloods, Los Angeles' Whisky-A-Go-Go with Colors, and in Palm Springs, appearing with the James Cotton Blues Band. Eight weeks after the group's relocation, bassist Jerry McGeorge made his final appearance with H. P. Lovecraft at the Los Angeles Kaleidoscope on April 12‚Äì14, 1968. He was replaced by Jeffrey Boyan, who had previously been a member of the Chicago band Saturday's Children. Critic Jeff Jarema has noted that Boyan was an accomplished bass player with a strong singing voice and that his addition to the band improved their abilities as a live act considerably. The band subsequently played West Coast concerts with the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Moby Grape, as well as with touring British bands such as Pink Floyd and The Who. The band's prowess and imagination as a live act during this period can be heard on the Live May 11, 1968 album. The live album, which, according to critic Ned Raggett, boasts \\"one of the best live recording qualities\\" for the period, was released in 1991 by Sundazed Records (Edsel Records in the UK) and was reissued in 2000. In June 1968, H. P. Lovecraft decamped to I.D. Sound Studios in Los Angeles with engineer Chris Huston to record their second album. Due to the intensive touring that the band had undertaken during the first half of 1968, there was a lack of properly arranged new material and consequently much of the album was improvised in the studio. Huston was pivotal in enabling the underprepared band to complete the recording sessions and was also responsible for creating many of the album's psychedelic sound effects. The album was released as H. P. Lovecraft II in September 1968, and, although it was less focused than its predecessor, it managed to successfully expand on the musical approach of the band's first album. Among its nine tracks, the album included \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\", another song based on the works of the author H. P. Lovecraft (this time his 1931 novella At the Mountains of Madness). The album also included a cover of Brewer & Shipley's \\"Keeper of the Keys\\", the Edwards-penned tracks \\"Electrollentando\\" and \\"Mobius Trip\\", a contribution from voice artist Ken Nordine, on the track \\"Nothing's Boy\\", and two songs written by Edwards' friend Terry Callier: \\"Spin, Spin, Spin\\" and \\"It's About Time\\". Like the band's first album, H. P. Lovecraft II failed to sell in sufficient quantities to reach the U.S. charts. Michaels decided to leave the band in late 1968, to return to university, and as a result, H. P. Lovecraft effectively collapsed in early 1969, with Tegza joining the band Bangor Flying Circus. A successor group, Lovecraft, was formed in 1969 and included Edwards and Tegza from the original line-up, although Edwards departed from the group soon after its formation. Edwards has subsequently undertaken production work and played in folk clubs under his real name Ethan Kenning, occasionally reuniting with Michaels, who records and performs under his real name David Miotke. =Lovecraft and Love Craft= After the breakup of H. P. Lovecraft, a spin- off band with the shortened name of Lovecraft was formed in late 1969 by George Edwards and Michael Tegza. The new band's line-up included two recruits from the Chicago band Aorta: guitarist Jim Donlinger and bassist Michael Been. Initially, it was hoped that Dave Michaels would also join the new incarnation of the band, but he withdrew and the group instead recruited keyboard player and singer Marty Grebb, previously of the Buckinghams. After securing a recording contract with Reprise Records, Edwards pulled out of the project and returned to performing as a solo folk singer. The remaining band members successfully completed recording sessions for an album titled Valley of the Moon, and promptly headed out on tour, supporting the Boz Scaggs Band and later Leon Russell. The Valley of the Moon album saw the group abandoning the eerie psychedelic ambiance that had characterized H. P. Lovecraft's music and instead featured a more laid-back, mainstream rock sound, somewhat reminiscent of Crosby, Stills & Nash or Uriah Heep. By the time that Valley of the Moon was released, Lovecraft had split up and the album, along with its attendant single \\"We Can Have It Altogether\\", failed commercially and did not chart. Following the demise of the band, Tegza rejoined Edwards in the band Elixir, playing a handful of shows in 1971, but never releasing any recordings. Of the other ex-members of Lovecraft, Grebb went on to form the Fabulous Rhinestones and eventually developed a career as a solo artist and session musician; Been joined Jerry Miller and Bob Mosley (both ex-members of Moby Grape) in Fine Wine and recorded the self-titled Fine Wine album in 1976, as well as playing Bay Area clubs with Miller in a band called The Original Haze in the late 1970s, before going on to front the new wave band the Call during the 1980s and 1990s; and Donlinger recorded a number of solo albums and published an autobiography titled Space Traveller: A Musician's Odyssey. In 1975, Tegza put together yet another variation of the group, this time a funk band with the name Love Craft, featuring vocalist Lalomie Washburn. Love Craft released the We Love You Whoever You Are album on Mercury Records in 1975, but the record sold poorly and, as a result, the band were dropped by their label and disbanded shortly thereafter. In 1980, Tegza and Love Craft guitarist Frankie Capek reunited to form a second version of the band, recruiting vocalist Marc Scherer and bassist Mark Gardner to complete the line-up. With a repertoire consisting of contemporary pop music and older psychedelic material, the band garnered some label interest, but broke up before they had secured a recording contract, due to Scherer leaving the band. Since then, Tegza has become a pastor and currently lives in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. First Assembly of God, Eureka Springs, Arkansas: Support staff. Retrieved 3 December 2014 Scherer is currently signed to Frontiers, Italy and records with Grammy winner Jim Peterik of 'Eye of the Tiger' fame. The Peterik/Scherer (PS) album 'Risk Everything' was set for release in Spring of 2015. Despite the involvement of Tegza and Edwards in Lovecraft and Love Craft, neither band is regarded as being fundamentally connected to H. P. Lovecraft or its history, beyond the obvious similarities in names and crossover member association. Literary references to the band Science fiction writer Harry Turtledove makes frequent references to the band H.P. Lovecraft (sometimes only as \\"HPL\\") in numerous stories. In one short story, \\"The Fillmore Shoggoth,\\" five historical members of HPL (including George Edwards as the viewpoint character) appear in a horror-adventure plot where Lovecraftian monsters attack the theater where they are performing.Joshi, S.T., ed.; The Madness of Cthulhu.

But when Gabrielle and Carlos go to pick up Grace, Carmen insists on taking Grace. Distraught over losing Grace, Gabrielle confides in Lynette, the only person she knows who has lost a child. Lynette tells Gabrielle that she wrote a letter to the child she lost, and that this might help Gabrielle, who wouldn't have to actually send it. Gabrielle writes the letter; Juanita finds it and runs away, hiding in the back of Bob and Lee's car, where Gabrielle sees her just in time for her to be rescued during the riot. A therapist suggests that Carlos and Gabrielle cut off all ties and reminders of Grace in order to let the tension with Juanita heal. Gabrielle is reluctant, keeping photos of Grace but Carlos demands she do this for Juanita. Gabrielle seems to agree, but goes to a boutique and buys a doll that resembles Grace and keeps it hidden from her family. After Juanita and Celia find it and play with it, ultimately breaking its arm, Gabrielle goes back to the boutique and has the owner repair \\"Princess Valerie\\". The owner promises to repair it, and Gabrielle, feeling she is too attached to the doll, asks the owner if she thinks Gabrielle is strange. The owner disagrees, and shows Gabrielle her own doll, Mrs. Humphreys. The owner tells Gabrielle that she fell in love with the doll and bought it, ultimately learning the doll's \\"story\\". The owner says that Mrs. Humphreys is a music teacher whose sister died around the same time the owner's did (hinting that the owner bought the doll as a replacement for her passed on sister, much as Gabrielle did). Gabrielle sees the owner's pain, and the owner asks Gabrielle about Princess Valerie's story. Although reluctant, Gabrielle emotionally tells her that the doll was a princess who was accidentally given to the wrong family, but she found her way back eventually, and her mother, the Queen, had her hid so that no one could take her away again. When she gets home, Gabrielle puts Princess Valerie in a box behind her closet. Carlos finds out about Gabrielle's obsession with the doll so they go out to get rid of it and get carjacked by an unknown gunman. Gabrielle tries to take Princess Valerie out of the car but she had to let her go because the gunman threatened to kill her. Carlos insists she go to therapy but she ignores it, going to spa treatments instead. Eventually, Carlos goes with her as she confesses to the therapist how she was molested as a child. At the therapist's suggestion, Gabrielle and Carlos go to her hometown where Gaby is surprised to learn she is a celebrity. She enjoys being admired by the townspeople until she meets the nun she had once confided in about her abuse as a child. The nun had then refused to believe Gabrielle's story and remains stubborn as Gabrielle lets out the shame she has long since been forced to feel by the cold nun's words; passing it back onto this woman who when could have prevented a childhood of torment did nothing, gives Gaby the sense of closure she has been seeking. Finally Gabrielle tells Carlos she is ready to go home and leave the past behind. Making amends for his past while in AA, Andrew decides to tell Carlos about running over his mother. While Carlos does forgive Andrew, he is furious with Gabrielle over keeping the secret from him. He tells Bree that he won't forgive her for hiding the truth and bans Gabrielle from seeing Bree again. Gabrielle takes her girls and temporarily moves in with Bree. She shortly returns to Carlos. Gabrielle shows a horror movie to Juanita, which gives her nightmares. She claims that a man is standing on the family's front lawn every night. Gabrielle is doubtful of this until she too notices the mysterious stranger. She sees him while shopping one day and asks a security officer to see a security camera. She realizes that her stalker is the stepfather who raped her as a child. This horrifies Gabrielle, especially because she thought that he was dead. Gabrielle learns her stepfather has been following her everywhere she goes. She drives to a deserted area when she knows he is following her, and walks into a clearing, armed with a gun that she acquired for her protection. She confronts him about raping her as a young girl. He admits to the terrible deed. During Susan's coming home dinner, Gabrielle runs home to begin preparations for dessert course. Once she enters her house, her stepfather confronts her again, pretending to have her gun. He begins to attack her attempts to rape her. However, Carlos comes home and intervenes, accidentally killing him with a blow to the head from a candlestick. Bree, Susan, and Lynette come into the house and discover the body. With help from Bree, they are able to clean up before the rest of the guests arrive. The group agrees to keep the situation secret. =Season 8= Gabrielle and Carlos deal with keeping the murder of her stepfather quiet, Carlos unable to be intimate due to his guilt. Gabrielle challenges the antagonistic PTA head at Juanita's school after a parking dispute only to accidentally hit the woman with her car. The woman gets revenge by making Gabrielle her replacement, warning her that being PTA head will drive Gabrielle crazy. The first meeting does not go well as Gabrielle is late due to a spa appointment and the other members berate her over putting her high-living lifestyle over her responsibilities. Assuming they're jealous, Gabrielle gives them massages and makeovers but they still refuse to help. They snap that Gabrielle has no idea how people like them live and her life is so perfect. However, when a drunken Carlos comes in, the PTA members realize that Gabrielle faces many struggles as well and she really isn't that different from them after all. They take over the luncheon project and allow Gabrielle to help her husband. When Carlos gets drunk before work, Gabrielle attempts to cover for him but his boss figures it out. Rather than be upset, the man tells Carlos he understands, being a recovering alcoholic himself, and urges Carlos to get help. Carlos checks himself into a rehab center but vanishes the same night detective Chuck Vance is killed, making Gabrielle worry Carlos might have done it while drunk. When a guilty Susan checks in on Alejandro's family, his suspicious widow, Claudia, follows her, believing Susan is having an affair with her husband. Gabrielle is upset with Susan until she hears Susan's suspicion that Claudia's daughter, Marisa, was also molested. Gabrielle invites Claudia over, telling her the truth about Alejandro. Claudia refuses to believe it until Marisa finally confesses what the man did to her, Claudia distraught to have had her daughter hurt like that. She later comes to Gabrielle, thanking her for letting her see the truth. She spots the rug stained with Alejandro's blood that Gabrielle was having replaced and tells Gabrielle to get rid of it, clearly knowing what happened to Alejandro and willing to keep it quiet. When Carlos gets out of rehab, he surprises Gabrielle by having a new attitude of giving away money, not wanting to be so greedy anymore. Gabrielle is upset at first but at Mike's funeral, realizes it's better to let Carlos do what makes him happy. She tries to calm her nerves by shopping and ends up being offered a job as a \\"personal shopper.\\" At first, Gabrielle is good with it but also has to pretend to be single to win over male shoppers. Carlos is upset with this and Gabrielle tells him she is doing what she wants and is enjoying it. When Bree is put on trial for killing Alejandro, both Carlos and Gabrielle want to tell the truth but Karen McCluskey (overhearing them talking about it) confesses on the stand to killing Alejandro herself. Gabrielle is eventually offered a promotion at her job with Carlos upset at first but coming to accept it. In the final moments of the series, it's stated that Carlos helps Gabrielle start her own online shopper company, which earns her a show on the Home Shopping Network. They eventually move to a mansion in Los Angeles where \\"they argued happily ever after.\\"  Trivia  * Roselyn S√°nchez auditioned for the role also but the producers thought she wasn't right for the role because of her heavy Puerto Rican accent.

Early life Williams was a native of Spokane, Washington. He attended North Central High School where he was an all-city running back and All-Inland Empire Athlete of the Year (1942) as a three-sport athlete. Graduating in 1942, Williams enrolled at the University of Idaho, but with the war efforts building he made the decision to join his older brother, William H. Williams (eventual Chief Justice of the Washington State Supreme Court) in the United States Army Air Corps. Williams became a fighter pilot flying P-38's in the Pacific theater. One of his most notable missions was as a fighter escort to both Japanese and American dignitaries traveling to Tokyo Bay and the peace signing on the USS Missouri in 1945. Returning from the war efforts, Williams enrolled at Washington State University, where he played both offense and defensive halfback for the Cougars from 1946 to 1948. He set the Pacific Coast Conference kickoff return record and led the Cougars in total offense in his senior season at WSU. Most notable was a punt return of 97 yards against Oregon in 1947 and kickoff returns of 88 and 87 yards against Montana and California. In Williams' senior season (1948) he earned All-Coast honors accumulating 1,500 all-purpose yards. He participated in both the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game and College All-Star Classic before joining the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). Professional career =Playing career= Drafted in the seventh round of the 1949 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, Williams played four seasons with the team, seeing most of his action as a defensive back. During his first three seasons the Rams made three consecutive trips to the NFL title game winning the 1951 NFL Championship. In his first season Williams intercepted five passes. The most memorable image of his Rams career however came in the 1951 regular season finale against the Green Bay Packers on December 16. Following a missed Packer field goal Williams returned the attempt 99 yards for a touchdown, a record that stood until the 1971 season when Williams coached, Al Nelson had a 102-yard missed field goal return, when rule changes allowed for missed field goal attempts into the end zone to be returned. Williams' desire to play on the offensive side of the ball led to his request to be traded and on May 12, 1953, Williams was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles. He proceeded to lead the Eagles in total offense during his first season and in his two years caught 75 passes, rushed for over 500 yards and scored eight touchdowns. Williams served in the capacity of player-coach in 1954 before leaving the playing field for the coaching ranks. =Coaching career= Officially entering the coaching ranks the following year Williams became the head coach at the University of Montana where in three seasons his teams, while known for their competitiveness went 6‚Äì21 overall. Football wasn't the only endeavor that led to close calls for Williams as he escaped with his life on two separate occasions during harrowing crash landings of small aircraft. While piloting a private plane on May 24, 1956, Williams and assistant Lauri Niemi were knocked unconscious in a crash near the Idaho/Montana border when they were forced, through bad weather, to attempt a landing on a rural mountain road. And again on October 3, 1957, Williams with 14 of his players, while en route to Provo, Utah to face the Brigham Young Cougars, were forced down for yet another emergency landing. After the 1957 season Williams returned to Philadelphia to serve as the Philadelphia Eagles defensive back coach under head coach Buck Shaw with the team capturing the 1960 NFL Championship in a thrilling 17‚Äì13 victory over Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers. It was also during this season that Williams came up with one of his most notable contributions to the game devising the \\"nickel\\" defensive scheme, a scheme still employed by most football programs today. Shaw retired after the 1960 season but new coach Nick Skorich kept Williams on his staff until their dismissal at the conclusion of the 1963 NFL season. New ownership and the arrival of a new coach and general manager in Joe Kuharich led to Williams accepting an assistant coaching position with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Shortly after the conclusion of the 1964 season Williams was elevated to head coach and compiled a 40‚Äì23‚Äì1 record over the next four years. Earning CFL Coach of the Year honors in 1967 William's teams reached the playoffs three times and competed in the 1968 Grey Cup (the first time in 19 years) On May 9, 1969, after another ownership change in Philadelphia, Williams was hired as the Eagles new head coach but endured a 7‚Äì22‚Äì2 record during his short two-year tenure. After dropping the first three games of the 1971 NFL season Williams was released, replaced by Ed Khayat, and finished the 1971 season as an assistant with the Cleveland Browns. On January 19, 1972, Williams returned to the CFL when he was named head coach of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. In just his first season the Ti-Cats reached the pinnacle of Canadian Professional football winning the Grey Cup in a 13‚Äì10 thriller over the Western Conference champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. Williams resigned after four seasons with the Tiger-Cats on December 12, 1975 following a 5‚Äì10‚Äì1 season. In his four years with Hamilton, Williams compiled a 30‚Äì29‚Äì1 record and a Grey Cup title. After briefly turning to ranching in Arizona Williams made one last foray into football returning as offensive coordinator with the Calgary Stampeders. He was later promoted to head coach on October 5, 1981 upon the firing of Ardell Wiegandt but once again retired from coaching football following that season, finishing out the 1981 season with a 1-3 record (the Stampeders finished 6-10 overall). He returned to Arizona to become part owner in a flight charter service and enjoy retirement in Prescott and later, Chandler. Death In 1990 Jerry was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia and spent two months in the hospital eventually making a full recovery. By 1998 however his health began to fail and on December 31 he died at his home in Chandler, Arizona with his wife, middle son and youngest daughter by his side.

Early life  Paxton was born on June 15, 1932 in Lexington, Virginia. After attending secondary school in New England, he received a B.A. from Washington and Lee University in 1954. Later, he won a Rhodes Scholarship and spent two years earning an M.A. at Merton College, Oxford, where he studied under historians including James Joll and John Roberts. He earned a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1963.  Career  Paxton taught at the University of California, Berkeley and the State University of New York at Stony Brook before joining the faculty of Columbia University in 1969. He served there for the remainder of his career, retiring in 1997. He remains a professor emeritus. He has contributed more than twenty reviews to The New York Review of Books, beginning in 1978 and continuing through 2017.  Vichy  Paxton is best known for his 1972 book Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944. In opposition to the traditional view pioneered by Robert Aron, he argued that the Vichy government was eager to collaborate with Nazi Germany and did not practice \\"passive resistance\\" to German rule.Henry Rousso, The Vichy Syndrome. History and Memory in France since 1944 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 253. Unlike Aron and Henri Michel, Paxton did not play down Vichy's achievements in his explanation of its domestic agenda. He argued that the reforms undertaken by the Vichy government prefigured the reforms of the 1950s and 1960s and derived from Vichy's aim to transform French society.Rousso, p. 253. Upon the book's publication in French translation in 1973, Paxton became the subject of intense vitriol from French historians and commentators. During a televised debate with Paxton in 1976, the Vichy naval leader Gabriel Auphan called him a liar. However, the translation sold thousands of copies, particularly to the young generation shaped by the civil unrest of May 1968 and who were uninterested in the \\"cozy mythologies\\" of Vichy apologists. Marc Ferro wrote that Vichy France would make the left feel uneasy by its contradiction of their belief that only the √©lite had betrayed France in 1940, \\"whereas in reality heroic resistance to the last man from Bayonne to Africa made no sense for anyone\\".Rousso, p. 253. He also noted that the Gaullists would object to Paxton's portrayal of them as \\"heirs of the regime they fought against\\" and that it would disturb all those who believed that P√©tain had played a \\"double game\\" between the Axis and the Allies.Rousso, p. 253. Communists welcomed the book for apparently confirming their belief that Vichy had been the product of \\"state monopoly capitalism\\" and it was also applauded by Jewish groups.Rousso, pp. 253-254. The reaction among Resistance groups was mixed due to Paxton's claim that there was no serious Resistance until well into 1941.Rousso, p. 254. In the preface to the 1982 edition of Vichy France, Paxton disagreed with the assertion of his opponents that he had written in \\"easy moral superiority\\" from the perspective of a \\"victor\\": \\"In fact [it] was written in the shadow of the war in Vietnam, which sharpened my animosity against nationalist conformism of all kinds. Writing in the late 1960s, what concerned me was not the comparison with defeated France but the confident swagger of the Germans in the summer of 1940\\".Rousso, p. 363. Today, the book is considered a historical classic and one of the best studies on France in the Vichy era. It was published at a time when French historians and filmmakers were also exploring history under the Vichy regime, as in Marcel Oph√ºls' influential two-part documentary The Sorrow and the Pity (1969). As an expert on the Vichy era, Paxton co-wrote Claude Chabrol's 1993 documentary The Eye of Vichy. In 1997 he testified at the trial of Vichy bureaucrat Maurice Papon.Robert Paxton: History Lesson, L'Humanit√©, Retrieved 29 August 2016.]  Fascism  Paxton has focused his work on exploring models and definition of fascism. In his 1998 paper \\"The Five Stages of Fascism,\\" he suggests that fascism cannot be defined solely by its ideology, since fascism is a complex political phenomenon rather than a relatively coherent body of doctrine like communism or socialism. Instead, he focuses on fascism's political context and functional development. The article identifies five paradigmatic stages of a fascist movement, although he notes that only Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy progressed through all five: # Intellectual exploration, where disillusionment with popular democracy manifests itself in discussions of lost national vigor # Rooting, where a fascist movement, aided by political deadlock and polarization, becomes a player on the national stage # Arrival to power, where conservatives seeking to control rising leftist opposition invite fascists to share power # Exercise of power, where the movement and its charismatic leader control the state in balance with state institutions such as the police and traditional elites such as the clergy and business magnates. # Radicalization or entropy, where the state either becomes increasingly radical, as did Nazi Germany, or slips into traditional authoritarian rule, as did Fascist Italy. In his 2004 book The Anatomy of Fascism, Paxton refines his five-stage model and puts forward the following definition for fascism: > Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive > preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by > compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party > of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective > collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and > pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints > goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.  Awards  In 2009, the French government awarded Paxton the Legion d'honneur.  Personal life  Paxton is an avid birdwatcher and a former president of the Linnaean Society of New York.

He is, for most of the series, the husband of Gabrielle Solis, portrayed by Eva Longoria. Early life Carlos was born in Guadalajara, Mexico to Juanita and Diego Solis. His father beat both Carlos and his mother so she told him that his father left them for a waitress in El Paso, but in \\"Come In, Stranger\\", Juanita told Gaby that when Diego beat Carlos when Carlos was 4, \\"she made sure that Diego Solis never hurt her son or her ever again.\\" It is implied that Juanita murdered Diego to protect Carlos and herself from his domestic violence. Carlos entered college on a golf scholarship. He soon started a successful career in finances. While at a fashion show, he met his future wife to whom he proposed on their third date. Overview =Season 1= Carlos wants a family so much that he replaced Gaby's birth control pills with sugar pills as she was against the idea. Due to financial difficulties, Carlos took a plea bargain and served 8 months in jail; separately, he was tried for hate crimes against two gay men who he thought were sleeping with Gabrielle. She was actually sleeping with John Rowland, their teenage gardener. John told Carlos that he beat up the wrong guy, causing Carlos to attack him and be convicted of the hate crimes. Gabrielle originally refused to get him off doing extra time after finding out he messed with her birth control, but made him promise he would take care of the baby in exchange for her testimony. =Season 2= After the loss of the baby, Carlos got early parole from a program for Catholic inmates. Through the program, Carlos met a nun, Sister Mary Bernard, who inspired him to live a more religious life. Following her miscarriage, she told Carlos that she did want children but she wanted Carlos to want her for her, not just because she was capable of having children. Sister Mary invited Carlos to accompany her to Botswana, and he agreed initially. When he went to the doctor in preparation for the trip, he left Gabrielle to fill out a form for him. She neglected to mention his allergy to eggs, resulting in Carlos suffering an allergic reaction to a vaccine so he stayed in Fairview. While delirious, he talked about Sister Mary in a very unreligious way, which Gabrielle reported to Father Crowley. He had Sister Mary transferred but not before she and Gabrielle had a fight. In the season finale, Gabrielle thought Carlos was dead but discovered that he paid the gardener, Ralph, to do his community service and Ralph was hit by a car. She also discovered Carlos was having an affair with the maid/surrogate, Xiao-Mei. =Season 3= In the third season opener, Gabrielle and Carlos decided to divorce but it was complicated, due to the baby that their surrogate, Xiao-Mei, was expecting. However, she went into labour on Bree & Orson's wedding day and gave birth to a black baby. The doctor admitted that the embryos were accidentally switched and their embryo didn't take, simplifying the divorce. However, it got nasty and took a hostage situation at a supermarket to make them realize what they had turned into. Carlos' attempt to stop scheming had limited success. He moved in with Mike Delfino, taking advantage of Mike's amnesia by claiming that they were best friends. He also began dating again although he and Gaby still had feelings for each other. He bonded with little Travers McLain after finding Travers wandering outside late at night. Spending time with him and his mother, Edie Britt, reignited his desire for children. Carlos and Edie began dating but kept it secret. However, when Carlos tells her that he doesn't want Gaby to know, Edie thinks he's still in love with her and tells Gabrielle, prompting Gaby to say that she was unhappy with Edie and Carlos dating but Edie ignored her. Carlos removed Gaby from Travers' party when he saw her making a scene and she said she was in love with Victor but he said that he and Edie would never be serious. Gaby realized he was still in love with her. Edie's ex-husband, Charles, came to collect Travers and Edie spoke to a lawyer about shared custody, suspecting Carlos was losing interest. Charles and Edie argued and Edie threatened to go for full custody. Carlos persuaded her not to, convincing her to think of Travers' best interests, which was to stay with Charles. For the sake of Travers he agreed to commit with Edie, not to let her feel lonely and in need of a family; this made her call off the custody. Edie was upset by Carlos laughing at the idea of getting married so she asked him to move in but he refused, having signed a lease with Lillian Simms. Determined to make Carlos move in with her, she visited Lillian and lied about Carlos so Lillian canceled the lease and Edie offered him a place to stay. Carlos guessed she was responsible and she asked why he wouldn't commit. He said that he didn't love her and she said that she could be pregnant. She wasn't and Carlos was disappointed. Seeing this, Edie suggested they try for a baby and he agreed. Edie, however, was still taking birth control pills which Carlos found and dumped her, leading her to attempt suicide in the season finale. =Season 4= In the fourth season, Carlos went home to find Edie hanging. He thought she was suicidal about their relationship but it emerged that she faked her suicide attempt. She nearly died as Karen McCluskey complained to Carlos about the garbage cans but saw something in Edie's bedroom window. They went to investigate and found Edie. They rushed her to hospital rang Gabrielle, telling her that they couldn't leave. Edie used her suicide and knowledge of Carlos' finances to make him stay but Carlos was resistant. She took it further by proposing marriage and telling him if he refused, she would tell the IRS about his illegal bank account so Carlos agrees but quietly moves the money. Edie hired a detective to spy on Carlos and discovered he and Gabrielle were having an affair. The detective took pictures of Carlos and Gabrielle kissing. Carlos left Edie. She also told the IRS about the offshore bank account but they told her that the account doesn't exist. Gabby broke up with Victor over a voicemail. Carlos goes to see Gabrielle and she tells him that Victor tried to kill her while out at sea so she knocked him overboard. They go back to get him and when they do, Victor and Carlos fight. Victor went to stab Carlos and Gabrielle knocked Victor overboard again. When they look for him, they can't see so Gabrielle decide to frame it as suicide and let the boat go out to sea. Carlos wants to go the police, but Gaby stops him. However, Victor is found alive. He claims to have amnesia and has forgotten what had happened on the boat, but when alone with Gaby, he threatens her, declaring that he remembers everything. Gaby and Carlos plan to leave town, but Victor attempts to kill Carlos. He runs out into the storm and Victor follows, but Victor is killed when impaled by a flying fence post. Carlos is hit on the head, rendering him unconscious and blind. Carlos lies to Gaby that his sight will return, but Gaby learns the truth when Edie congratulates her for accepting the lifelong task of caring for a disabled husband. Gabie is upset that Carlos lied but he explains that he was worried that she would not marry him, had she known the truth. Gaby tells Carlos that she is with him \\"for better or worse.\\" Five-year jump Carlos and Gaby have two daughters, Juanita and Celia Solis. Carlos is still blind and they have been downgraded to lower class. =Season 5= Five years after Season 4, Carlos' life has changed dramatically. Despite medical doubts, Gaby unexpectedly got pregnant twice. While Carlos viewed Gaby's pregnancies as \\"miracles\\", she was less enthusiastic and worried about money. Carlos became a massage therapist to keep them afloat. Early in the season, Carlos learned that his sight can be restored. He happily anticipated seeing his wife for the first time in years and his daughters for the first time. Gaby, however, was worried that he wouldn't recognize her and find her unattractive. When his sight is restored, Carlos finds his daughters and wife beautiful and notices that Gabrielle sold nearly all her valuable belongings to support their family. He eventually took a high-paying business job so he could give Gabrielle and his daughters a better life. In episode 17, Carlos became president of the company he was working at, due to the death of Bradley Scott. Later in this episode, he hired Lynette Scavo. In the season finale, Aunt Connie claims she is dying and needs someone to care for her granddaughter, Ana. Carlos agrees, to pay back the aunt who did so much for him, despite Gaby's protests. Ana seems nice but is a schemer who can get guys to do what she wants by flirting. =Season 6= Two months have passed and Carlos and Gaby continue to look after his niece, Ana. While Gaby complains about Ana's bad behaviour, Carlos is more sympathetic and urges his wife to sign the papers that would make them Ana's legal guardians. Eventually, Gaby agrees. Lynette tells him she is pregnant and he makes her choose - her job or her family. When Lynette threatens to sue, Carlos responds by giving her an impossible amount of work to do in one night and when she couldn't complete it, fires her for incompetence. However, he rehires her after she saves Celia from an out of control airplane and she agrees not to sue. However, one evening, Carlos finds Danny and Ana fooling around and attacks Danny. Angie overhears Carlos threatening her son and comes running, throwing a vase against the wall and proves that she is just as strong-willed as Carlos, who releases Danny. When he and Gaby try making amends, they overhear her and Nick arguing about her shaded past. =Season 7= Carlos finds out that Juanita is not their real daughter, but hides it from Gaby, afraid that it will hurt her. When Gaby eventually finds out, they go out to look for her real daughter, Grace. Over first meeting her, they see Grace throwing a tantrum over an expensive jacket, and know that Grace is Gaby's real daughter. They also find out that her parents are illegal immigrants, though Grace (being born in the United States) is a citizen. Her father gets arrested after not showing the police a license, leaving Grace's non-biological mother to go in hiding. Even though Gaby and Carlos try multiple times to take in Grace at her house, Grace's non-biological mother insists she stay with her. He supports Gaby when she goes into therapy after she begins to lose it, and later goes to Gaby's hometown with her to confront her former stepfather who is now dead, but instead Gaby sees a teacher who she confided in and didn't believe her, causing to Gaby to tell the woman she should feel ashamed and not her. They leave the town and Gaby puts the past behind her. When Andrew seeks rehab for drinking, he decides to come clean to Carlos over running over his mother. Bree and Gaby both try to stop him and when Carlos invites Andrew to a camping trip, they suspect the worst. They chase Carlos to the woods and when they see him with a bloody towel and dirty shovel, Bree blurts out what Andrew did just before her son returns. Carlos is outraged, not only with Andrew but with Bree and Gaby for hiding the truth. He tries to force Andrew to drink in his mother's memory and walks out of the cabin. Andrew, Bree and Gaby find him at his mother's grave as Andrew talks to him about what happened and Carlos decides to forgive him. When Bree comes to thank him, however, Carlos coldly says that he can't forgive her knowing the truth all these years and hiding it from him and tells Bree their friendship is over. This changes, however, after Carlos kills Gaby's stepfather, who returned to Wisteria Lane and was tormenting her. The two appear to have reconciled after Bree agreed to not say a word to anybody. =Season 8= The first episodes of the season depict Carlos trying to overcome the guilt for killing Alejandro. Because of this, he starts drinking. After a number of incidents, Carlos decides to go to rehab. While in rehab, he discovers that what counselors do has much more impact on people's lives and is more helpful than his own position as a business executive. For this reason, Carlos decides to become a counselor himself after coming out from rehab, resigning to his post as director. At first, he faces opposition from Gaby, but she eventually supports him and finds a job herself as personal shopper. Gaby's job turns out to be better paid than Carlos', and he starts to feel uncomfortable with the idea of Gaby playing the family provider role. When it turns out that Bree may face 20 years to life sentence, both Carlos and Gaby are about to confess that they committed Alejandro's murder; in the end, Mrs. McCluskey herself confesses she committed the murder, after overhearing a conversation between Carlos and Gaby, and is left without charges due to her advanced age and health condition. It is revealed at the end of the finale that Carlos helped Gaby to start an online shopper company, which eventually leads to her becoming a host in her own talk show. Carlos and his family leave Wisteria Lane 1 year after the events of the series finale, and move to a mansion in Los Angeles where they argued happily ever after.

From 1770 to 1774 the village went through a complete restructure due to its near disappearance due to the Indians' inability to adapt to life there. Damiana da Cunha, granddaughter of the chief of the Caiap√≥s was instrumental in converting the Indians. In 1780 the village was designated a freguesia with the name of S√£o Jos√© de Moss√¢medes. In 1781, due to the continuing evasion of the Indians, another group of 800 Java√©s and Caraj√°s was brought from the Ilha do Bananal. In 1845 Moss√¢medes became a district, belonging to Itabera√≠.

It was written at a time when serious discussions were taking place between the Presbyterian and Episcopal churches in the hopes that there would be recognition of each other's sacraments and ministry, and possibly full union. These discussions took place during the eleven years from 1937 until 1948, and thus influenced the writing of the Book of Common Worship of 1946. This led to one of the criticisms of the book, that it was more Anglican than Reformed. That the committee member who had prepared the eucharistic rite had received his Th.D. degree from an Episcopal seminary provided fuel for such criticism.

The siege was conducted by Gaius Trebonius, one of Caesar's senior legates, while the naval operations were in the capable hands of Decimus Brutus, Caesar's naval expert. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus had become proconsul of Gaul and was sent to gain control of Massilia (modern Marseille) in order to oppose Caesar. As Caesar marched to Hispania (en route to the Battle of Ilerda), the Massiliots closed their gates to him, having allied with Ahenobarbus and the Optimates. Roused by their hostile actions, he commenced a siege against Massilia, leaving the newly raised 17th, 18th, and 19th legions to conduct the siege under the command of Gaius Trebonius. He also placed Decimus Brutus in charge of his fleet there. Caesar himself marched with his veteran legions to Hispania to fight the Pompeian generals Lucius Afranius and Marcus Petreius. He would return to the siege of Massilia after defeating his opponents at the battle of Ilerda. After the siege had begun, Ahenobarbus arrived in Massilia to defend it against the Caesarian forces. In late June, Caesar's ships, although they were less skilfully built than those of the Massiliots and outnumbered, were victorious in the ensuing naval battle. Gaius Trebonius conducted the siege using a variety of siege machines including siege towers, a siege-ramp, and a \\"testudo-ram\\". Gaius Scribonius Curio, careless in adequately guarding the Sicilian Straits, allowed Lucius Nasidius to bring more ships to the aid of Ahenobarbus. He fought a second naval battle with Decimus Brutus in early September, but withdrew defeated and sailed for Hispania. Trebonius built a stationary tower, square and six stories in height, under the very walls of the city and in the face of a rain of missiles from its engines. The walls of the tower were of brickwork thick. When the lowest storey was built it was covered with a solid fireproof roof which was not secured to the walls but rested upon them like a lid. The eaves projected considerably, and from them screens were hung on all sides, covering all the walls. By means of screws the whole canopy, roof, and screens was now raised to the height of one storey and the workmen proceeded to build the walls of that storey under its protection. This process was repeated in the same manner until the full height of the tower was attained.cesar: de Bello Civili, Book II, 8, 9. The Massiliots valiantly defended against the siege machines and works. They threw down burning pitch and pine-shavings and the Caesarians undermined the foundations of their city walls. At one point they seemed likely to surrender and declare a truce, but at night they cunningly destroyed the siege works in a gross violation of the treaty, according to Caesar's own account (Bellum Civile 2.14; alternatively, Dio 41.25.2 records that the Massiliots destroyed these works in response to a surprise attack by the Caesarian forces). The city's inhabitants were then near surrender. At the final surrender of Massilia, Caesar showed his usual leniency and Lucius Ahenobarbus escaped to Thessaly in the only vessel that was able to escape from the Populares. Afterwards, Massilia was allowed to keep nominal autonomy, due to ancient ties of friendship and support of Rome, along with some territories while most of its empire was confiscated by Julius Caesar. In Fiction *In Colleen McCullough's novel Caesar (the Master of Rome series) the siege is described in some detail. *In Steven Saylor's novel Last Seen in Massilia (the Roma Sub Rosa series) the siege is the setting for the story.

In interviews, Osymyso has indicated that it takes him a week to make a track that contains no samples, but that he can compose a bootleg track in a matter of hours. In 2005, Osymyso set himself the task of releasing one short track every week for 50 weeks, a project he called 05ymy50. However, progress was slower than hoped, and by year's end only 15 tracks had been completed. Despite this, Osymyso felt the project was at least a partial success: some of the tracks have been released on vinyl by Juno Records, and Osymyso has indicated that he may eventually finish the project.

It consists of three books covering the events of 49-48 BC, from shortly before Caesar's invasion of Italy to Pompey's defeat at the Battle of Pharsalus and flight to Egypt. It was preceded by the much longer account of Caesar's campaigns in Gaul and was followed by similar works covering the ensuing wars against the remnants of Pompey's armies in Egypt, North Africa, and Spain. Caesar's authorship of the Commentarii de Bello Civili is not disputed, while the three later works are believed to have been written by contemporaries of Caesar.See Suetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars: Julius 56 who suggests Aulus Hirtius and Gaius Oppius as possible authors. Title The Latin title \\"Commentarii de Bello Civili\\" is often retained as the title of the book in English translations of the work. The title itself is Latin for \\"Commentaries on the Civil War\\". It is sometimes shortened to just \\"Civil Wars\\", \\"About the Civil Wars\\", and \\"The Civil War\\", in English translations.Henderson, p. vii  Background and motivations  Following his consulship in 59 BCE, Caesar served an unprecedented ten-year term as governor of Gallia Cisalpina, Gallia Narbonensis, and Illyricum. During this time he conducted a series of devastating military campaigns against the various groups of people inhabiting Gaul (primarily present-day France and Belgium) culminating in the Battle of Alesia and the annexation of all of Gaul. As a result of nearly ten years of conquest, Caesar had not only amassed enormous wealth but had established himself as a formidable military and political rival to Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Marcus Crassus, had earlier formed a political alliance known as the First Triumvirate. This alliance had overthrown many of the formal legal institutions of the state, through their combined command of the Senate, the Centuriate Assembly and the Tribal Assembly of the Plebs. This friendship of convenience came to an end with the death of Crassus in 53 BCE, and Pompey's marriage to Cornelia Metella, the daughter of a fierce opponent of Caesar. Amid a fresh outbreak of political violence in Rome, Pompey was appointed sole consul in 52 and solidified his support among the Optimates in the Senate. Caesar, meanwhile, had concluded his conquest of Gaul and, aided by the publication of his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, had become a champion of the people. The Senate, whose authority Caesar had defied in obtaining his post as governor, recognized that Caesar posed a serious political threat and demanded that he disband his army in order to be allowed to stand for the consulship. Caesar agreed provided that Pompey do the same, but this only further enraged the Senate. As his term as governor came to an end, Pompey and the Senate demanded that Caesar disband his army and return to Rome, and they forbade him to run for consul in absentia. Knowing that he would be ruined by his political opponents without either the protection provided by his army or the immunity offered by the consulship, Caesar ignored the demands of the Senate and, by entering into Italy at the head of his army on January 10, 49 BCE, provoked the Senate to declare him an enemy of the Roman people. In the text, Caesar presents himself as the victim of a conspiracy occurring in Rome led by his political enemies, including Gnaeus Pompeius, Scipio, and Marcus Cicero. Throughout the commentaries he presents his cause as a noble one to restore order and return peace to the Roman people, while showing how his actions were justified. He also commonly presents himself as a humane liberal on the epicurean model. Caesar omits many details of the military campaigns, focusing in large part on the larger strategic situation and the reasoning behind the actions occurring.  Contents  Caesar organized his commentaries into three separate books, at that time written on individual scrolls. Each book is subdivided into numbered paragraphs. The books cover a two-year period discussing the Roman Civil War during 49 and 48 BC. = Book I = Written as a narrative, the book begins with the expiration of Caesar's term as governor of Gaul and the party dominating the Roman Senate ordering him to return to the city to face charges of misconduct and possible execution.Caesar, 1.2 Caesar explains how he was wronged by Pompeius and his cohorts, who refused to permit him the triumph that was traditionally permitted to victorious generals. He proceeds with his army to invade Italy from Gaul. Pompeius attempts to raise an army in southern Italy, but is forced to retreat with the army to Greece. Caesar continually points to his efforts to reach an accommodation with Pompeius, and attempts to portray Pompeius as a jealous man only interested in perpetuating a rule in which he and his inner circle control the Republic.Caesar, 1.5-8 = Book II = Caesar's lieutenant Gaius Trebonius besieges Massilia. After a long siege, the Massilians finally surrender to Caesar, who shows his typical leniency to the vanquished. Curio sets out for Africa and establishes camp near Utica. He routs the troops of Publius Attius Varus, and the Numidian King Juba sends reinforcements to Varus. Curio is overly confident; his poor decision-making leads to his army being trapped and slaughtered by the Numidians. Juba takes several Roman senators captive. = Book III = Caesar and his army follow Pompeius across the Adriatic Sea to Greece after a mop up operation in Italy and in Spain. In Greece Pompeius initially has the stronger position, with more troops, controlling many of the strategic areas.Caesar, 1.23 Caesar writes a lengthy monologue about the superiority of his army of elite veterans of the pacification of Gaul, and dismisses Pompeius' tactics and the strength of his army. He points out that Pompeius' army was drawn largely from the provinces and was poorly trained. After Caesar successfully outmanoeuvred Pompeius's army in the eastern Balkans, Pompeius and his army gradually fall back into Macedonia. Caesar then writes another monologue portraying Pompeius as a coward because of his refusal to make a stand against Caesar, whose army was beginning to have supply problems, and pointed to Scipio as the primary obstacle to peace. Caesar describes Scipio as a maniacal and untrustworthy but weak villain concerned only with destroying Caesar. Scipio raises a personal army of his own from his provinces in Asia Minor and moves to reinforce Pompeius.Caesar, 2.4 The book climaxes with the Battle of Pharsalus in June 48. The lengthy battle and siege resulted in a decisive victory by Caesar's army. Pompeius and his cohorts flee to other areas of the Republic in an attempt to reverse their fortunes. Caesar then leads his army across the Mediterranean Sea in pursuit of Pompeius, who had landed in Egypt.Caesar, 3.103 There Pompeius was murdered, according to Caesar, by the Egyptians. Caesar ends the book with an epilogue on the Egyptians' lack of justification for killing Pompeius. He then proceeds to explain his reasoning for occupying Egypt with his army, using a succession crisis among the Egyptian royal family as his pretence. The Egyptians resisted and Caesar seized the Pharos. The book ended with the line \\"Haec initia belli Alexandrini fuerunt.\\" (\\"These things were the beginning of the Alexandrian war\\").Caesar, 3.112 The events of the book were followed by the books Alexandrian, African and Hispanic wars, written most likely by officers of Caesar's armies. Criticism and revival Modern historians lament the fact that Caesar omits many important details about the military events, primarily because the book is the only source known to exist for many of the events that occurred in it, but also because it was written from the unique perspective of the most powerful figure in the Republic and one of the most notable generals in human history. The book was for a time lost, but was rediscovered in Italian city archives in the Middle Ages. The oldest known manuscripts of the commentaries date to the tenth century AD. Parts of the book have remained lost though, with at least sixteen passages known to be missing. Given its much shorter length when compared to Caesar's other works, and its abrupt ending, it is possible that he never finished the work, or that a significant part may still be missing. In 1469 the commentaries were republished in Rome, from which edition most modern copies are now derived. In 1809 Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, ordered a detailed look at the works of Caesar. The Commentarii de Bello Civili, along with his other works, were compiled into the Histoire de Jules Cesar, and served as an important history that renewed interest in Caesar.Henderson, p. x The Commentarii de Bello Civili, along with Caesar's other literary works, became staple reading for Latin studies around the world because of their quality and simplicity and because of the excellent grammar employed by Caesar in his writings.Henderson, pp. ix‚Äìx References Sources Damon, Cynthia (2015) C.

The company‚Äôs headquarters is in Hamburg and it has branches in Austria, France, England, Switzerland, Japan, China, Mexico, Colombia, Finland, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Brasil and the USA.  Foundation and history  In 1840, locksmith A.C.C. Joachims set up on his own in Hamburg and began to build scales. He had acquired the necessary know-how from the Strasbourg mechanic and monk Quintenz who had invented the decimal scale in 1821. In the course of the next thirty years, the locksmith‚Äôs workshop developed into a small factory. However, the business stagnated when Joachims died in 1874. Things started to improve again when Frederik Vogel, a young businessman, purchased the scales factory in 1888. He expanded the product range and introduced the brand name seca which he had registered in 1897. The company survived World War I and the Great Depression in the 20th century and then Frederik Vogel passed the management over to his son Robert. Robert Vogel steered the company through World War II and began with the successful reconstruction immediately after the end of the war. When Robert Vogel died in 1966, his son S√∂nke joined the company. In 1970, S√∂nke Vogel decided in favour of a new corporate concept.

Development A Coventry in The Tank Museum, Bovington A Coventry in action. The Coventry was a combined effort between Daimler and the Rootes Group to produce a standard armoured car design. The Coventry was an advanced design and featured a similar layout to the more compact Daimler, but with a more conventional suspension and drive system. It included duplicate driving controls to allow rapid disengagement in combat. There were two production versions. The Mark 1 employed a three-man turret with a 2-pounder gun and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun. The prototypes from Daimler and Humber were produced with a 2-pounder gun. In 1943, orders were placed for 1,700 vehicles that were to be able to carry the 6-pounder gun. A version - AFVW90 - with a larger turret with a 75 mm gun but one fewer crewman was planned and 900 of these ordered. Deliveries of the Coventry Mk 1, from the Humber assembly line, began in June 1944 and 63 vehicles had been produced by the end of the year. It was decided, in 1943, that production of the Daimler would be continued instead of the Coventry armoured car replacing it. As a result, the order for the 2-pounder Coventry was reduced to 300 that would be sent to India. The 75 mm armed Mark II did not enter production. Output concluded with a further 220 vehicles in 1945. The Coventry was deployed by the British Army, but they arrived too late for wartime service. Some of these units were sold to France and later saw action against the Viet Minh during Indochina War.

The station is east of Dundee on the line between Dundee and Aberdeen.  History  There have been three stations called \\"Arbroath\\", two of which closed in 1848. One - Arbroath Catherine Street - served the Arbroath and Forfar Railway; the other - Arbroath Lady Loan or Arbroath West - was on the Dundee and Arbroath Railway. The current station was originally opened by the Dundee and Arbroath Railway on 1 February 1848 as a link station to connect the Arbroath and Forfar Railway with the Dundee and Arbroath Railway. On 1 October 1880 the North British, Arbroath and Montrose Railway opened north towards Montrose. Jointly run by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the London and North Eastern Railway after the Grouping of 1923, the station then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced by British Rail in the 1980s, the station was served by Scotrail until the privatisation of British Rail. Until 1990, the station had 3 active platforms and was the terminus of a regular local service from Perth and Dundee that called at all of the intermediate local stations between the latter station and here. This was mostly withdrawn at the May 1990 timetable change (due to a low usage and a rolling stock shortage) and the residual service that still operates now starts and terminates at Carnoustie. The former platform 3 and its associated loop has also been taken out of use and lifted. From 2018, a stopping service to Dundee (and potentially beyond) is to be reintroduced as part of a major timetable improvement package backed by Transport Scotland. This will serve Carnoustie, Monifieth and Broughty Ferry stations every hour through the day. Existing services through to Glasgow and Edinburgh will also be accelerated as part of the same recast.

Union of International Associations The aim is to force compliance by causing distress, which could be in the form of pain, anxiety, psychological disturbance, immobilization, or disorientation. One form of this torture involves forcibly injecting a person with addictive drugs in order to induce physical dependence. The drug is then withdrawn, and, once the person is in withdrawal, the interrogation is started. If the person complies with the torturer's demands, the drug is reintroduced, relieving the person's withdrawal symptoms. Alleged use  =Brazil= In Brazil, pharmacological torture involved the injection of alcohol into the tongue in the 1940s, the injection of ether into the scrotum in the 1960s, and drugs were used to cause strong contractions in the 1970s. Also, muscle relaxants were used to minimize muscular rigidity and bone fractures caused by electric shock in the 1970s. =Romania= In the 1960s, prisoners were reportedly given drugs to make them talk in their sleep. =South Africa= In 2013, leaked video footage shot inside South Africa's Mangaung Prison showed a prisoner with no record of mental illness being forcibly injected, apparently with anti-psychotic drugs. The Legal Resources Centre, a non-governmental organization, is representing 13 clients who allege they were forcibly injected with the drugs. =Soviet Union= In the former Soviet Union, drugs were allegedly used as a form of punishment. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, was a preferred agent. It was used to induce intense restlessness and Parkinson's-type symptoms. Another antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine (trade name Thorazine‚Ñ¢), was also used to induce grogginess, sedation, and (in high doses) vegetative states. Other alleged uses of pharmacological torture included: *Use of insulin shock therapy to render people comatose. *Administering Sulfazin to induce severe fevers. *Use of sodium amobarbital with LSD to cause loss of inhibition. =United States= In the United States, in a series of hearings in the fall and winter of 1977, Congressional committees drew forth disclosure of project MKULTRA, which was most active between 1953 and 1966 and conducted experiments that included the CIA agents administering LSD and Truth Serum to soldiers, citizens, and foreign nationals without their knowledge or consent.

Chandler (born circa 1954) is an Ohio medical technician who has been a perennial candidate for the Ohio House and the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat. Chandler served on the Ohio Democratic Party's State Central Committee in the 1990s but Chandler is now a Republican. Chandler, a resident of the California neighborhood of Cincinnati, graduated from New Richmond High School and attended the University of Cincinnati. He worked at Cincinnati's Jewish Hospital as a lead material specialist from 1973. Chandler was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the Second District in 1992, running unopposed for the Democratic nomination in the June 2 primary election. That day he elected Democratic State Committeeman for the Second Congressional District. The vote was 9,856 for Chandler, 4,442 for attorney Rupert E. Ruppert, and 6,858 for Terry M. Tranter. The heavily Republican Second District included all of Clermont, Adams, and Brown Counties, and parts of Hamilton and Warren Counties. The Dayton Daily News wrote \\"Veteran Bill Gradison is being perfunctorily challenged by Thomas Chandler, who admits to having happily voted for Rep. Gradison in the past. The Democrats wanted to put somebody on the ticket.\\" Chandler supported raising taxes to lower the budget deficit, was pro-choice, and opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and school vouchers. On November 3, Chandler lost to Gradison, a congressman since 1975, by a vote of 75,924 to 177,720, with write-in candidate Emily Roughen Wood receiving seven votes. Gradison hugely outspent his opponent, $74,652 to $290. On the same day he lost his congressional bid, he was chosen an elector for Ohio and cast his votes on December 14 for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. When Gradison resigned in January 1993, Chandler was the first to announce his candidacy in the March 16 special primary election for the overwhelmingly Republican district. Chandler said the most important issue was the economy and felt taxes needed to be raised. He supported cuts in foreign aid, defense, NASA, and health research. Chandler was opposed by Sharonville attorney Lee Hornberger; Ralph Applegate, the business agent of an architect, who lived outside the district in Columbus; Ray Mitchell, a perennial candidate and business broker from Montgomery County's Miami Township, also outside the district; and Robert Dale McDilda Sr. of Price Hill, who ran for the United States Senate in Alabama in 1986. The Dayton Daily News described Chandler's opponents in skeptical terms: :When Mr. Mitchell writes campaign literature or letters to the editor, he refers to himself in the third person (\\"Ray Mitchell has been ahead of the times\\") and is generous in giving himself credit for happenings he didn't cause, such as cutbacks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Mound Labs. The other Democrats are Robert McDilda whose Apocalyptic slash-the-deficit fervor collapses in the details, and Ralph Applegate, a Columbus engineer who says he was fired unconstitutionally by the Defense Department and would move into the district if he won. \\"We ran a decent, fair, open Democratic primary,\\" Hornberger said after he defeated Chandler. \\"I started out with five supporters in mid-January and by tonight I had two- thirds of the Democratic votes.\\" These were the final results: #Lee Hornberger, 3,627 (45.99%) #Thomas R.

Applegate, 840 (10.65%) #Ray Mitchell, 795 (10.08%) #Robert Dale McDilda, Sr., 402 (5.10%) Hornberger lost the special general election to another attorney, Rob Portman. Chandler in 1994 won the Democratic nomination in the May 3 primary by defeating Terry M. Tranter, 10,546 (76.15%) to 8,372 (44.25%). He faced incumbent Jacquelyn K. O'Brien in the 37th Ohio House district, which included the eastern Cincinnati neighborhoods of Oakley, the East End, Hyde Park, Mount Lookout, Columbia Tusculum, Linwood, California and Mount Washington; the cities of Norwood and Newtown; and Anderson Township. He told The Cincinnati Post that year that he was in favor of casino gambling in Ohio and supported the death penalty. O'Brien won the endorsement of The Post, which wrote Chandler \\"would bring enthusiasm to the job but needs time to mature politically.\\" Chandler lost the election in a heavily Republican district. O'Brien received 29,198 votes (76.15%) to Chandler's 9,146 (23.85%). Chandler was also greatly outspent by his opponent: $10,602 to $1,160 Chandler won the Democratic nomination to challenge Portman in 1996 by defeating Ray Mitchell in the March primary with three-fourths of the vote. \\"I know it is going to be a rough campaign, but I'm ready for it,\\" Chandler said. He predicted a negative campaign, \\"and the negatives may come from me. I've got to be on the attack.

As an independent drug policy think tank, Transform is consulted regularly by its key audiences in policy making, the NGO sector and the media. Transform develops, and advocates for, new policies to bring currently illegal drugs under effective legal control and regulation, based on evidence of effectiveness, claiming that current policy is outdated and demonstrably counter-productive, being based on populist law and order politics and a misplaced 'drug war' ideologies. Transform argues that moves towards legal regulation and control of currently illegal drugs would produce dramatically improved policy outcomes as measured by key performance indicators in crime, public health and well being, social nuisance, environmental damage, international corruption and conflict, and public expenditure. Public impact Transform has been steadily gaining support from professionals and public figures; whose fields include policy making, academia, business, church, judiciary, police, media, public health and medicine.

Other chains purchased included Burton Supermarkets (Nottingham based), Elmos (East Anglian based) and Coopers (Scotland based in 1955). The business was regularly listed as third in market share behind Sainsbury's and Tesco, and had stores nationwide. They also owned the Melias, and Shoppers Paradise chains of convenience and discount food stores, and moved into the burgeoning DIY industry with their Fix and Fit stores (sold to WHSmith Do It All in 1986).

Asprey (), page 1125Global Geopolitics: A Critical Introduction by Klaus Dodds (), page 205British Civilization by John Oakland (), page 108Northern Ireland by Jonathan Tonge (), page 2 The Provisional IRA emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army in 1969, partly as a result of that organisation's perceived failure to defend Catholic neighbourhoods from attack in the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. The Provisionals gained credibility from their efforts to physically defend such areas in 1970 and 1971. From 1971‚Äì72, the IRA took to the offensive and conducted a relatively high-intensity campaign against the British and Northern Ireland security forces and the infrastructure of the state. The British Army characterised this period as the \\"insurgency phase\\" of the IRA's campaign. The IRA declared a brief ceasefire in 1972 and a more protracted one in 1975, when there was an internal debate over the feasibility of future operations. The armed group reorganised itself in the late 1970s into a smaller, cell-based structure, which was designed to be harder to penetrate. The IRA then carried out a smaller scale but more sustained campaign, which they characterised as the 'Long War', with the eventual aim of weakening the British government's resolve to remain in Ireland. The British Army called this the \\"terrorist phase\\" of the IRA's campaign. The IRA made attempts in the 1980s to escalate the conflict with the aid of weapons donated by Libya. In the 1990s they also resumed a campaign of bombing economic targets in London and other cities in England. On 31 August 1994, the IRA called a unilateral ceasefire with the aim of having their associated political party, Sinn F√©in, admitted into the Northern Ireland peace process. The organisation ended its ceasefire in February 1996 but declared another in July 1997. The IRA accepted the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 as a negotiated end to the Northern Ireland conflict. In 2005 the organisation declared a formal end to its campaign and had its weaponry decommissioned under international supervision. Other aspects of the Provisional IRA's campaign are covered in the following articles: *For a chronology, see Chronology of Provisional IRA actions *For the Provisional IRA's armament, see Provisional IRA arms importation Beginnings In the early days of the Troubles (1969‚Äì72), the Provisional IRA was poorly armed, with only a handful of old weapons left over from the IRA's Border campaign of 1956‚Äì1962. The IRA had split in December 1969 into the Provisional IRA and Official IRA factions. In the first years of the conflict, the Provisionals' main activities were defending Irish nationalist areas from attacks. In contrast to the IRA's relative inaction during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, in the summer of 1970, the Provisional IRA mounted determined armed defences of the nationalist areas of Belfast against loyalist attackers, killing a number of Protestant civilians and loyalists in the process. On 27 June 1970, the IRA killed five Protestant civilians during street disturbances in Belfast.Sutton Index of Deaths ‚Äì 1970 Three more were shot in Ardoyne in north Belfast after gun battles broke out during an Orange Order parade. When loyalists retaliated by attacking the nationalist enclave of Short Strand in east Belfast, Billy McKee, the Provisionals' commander in Belfast, occupied St Matthew's Church and defended it in a five-hour gun battle with the loyalists, in what became known as the Battle of St Matthew's. One of his men was killed, he was badly wounded, and three loyalists were also killed.Mallie, Bishop, The Provisional IRA p157-158 The Provisional IRA gained much of its support from these activities, as they were widely perceived among nationalists as being defenders of nationalist and Irish Catholic people against aggression. Initially, the British Army, deployed into Northern Ireland in August 1969 to reinforce the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and restore government control, was welcomed in Catholic nationalist areas as a neutral force compared to the Protestant- and unionist-dominated RUC and Ulster Special Constabulary.Taylor, pp. 56‚Äì59 However, this good relationship with nationalists did not last long. The Army was soon discredited in the eyes of many nationalists by incidents such as the Falls Curfew of July 1970, when 3,000 British troops imposed martial law conditions on the nationalist lower Falls area of west Belfast. After a gun and grenade attack on troops by Provisional IRA members, the British fired over 1,500 rounds of ammunition in gun battles with both the Official IRA and Provisional IRA in the area, killing six civilians. Thereafter, the Provisionals continued targeting British soldiers. The first soldier to die was gunner Robert Curtis, killed by Billy Reid in a gun battle in February 1971.Taylor, p. 88 1970 and 1971 also saw feuding between the Provisional and Official IRAs in Belfast, as both organisations vied for supremacy in nationalist areas. Charlie Hughes, commander of the Provisionals' D Company in the Lower Falls, was killed before a truce was brokered between the two factions.Taylor, p. 79 Early campaign 1970‚Äì72 The M1 Garand rifle, typical of the World War II-era weaponry the Provisional IRA had in the early 1970s In the early 1970s, the IRA imported large quantities of modern weapons and explosives, primarily from supporters in the United States and the government of Libya.The IRA, 1968‚Äì2000 By J. Bowyer Bell Leader of the Opposition Harold Wilson in 1971 secretly met with IRA leaders with the help of John O'Connell, angering the Irish government; Garret FitzGerald wrote 30 years later that \\"the strength of the feelings of our democratic leaders ... was not, however, publicly ventilated at the time\\" because Wilson was a former and possible future British prime minister. As the conflict escalated in the early 1970s, the numbers recruited by the IRA mushroomed, in response to the nationalist community's anger at events such as the introduction of internment without trial and Bloody Sunday, when the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment of the British Army shot dead 14 unarmed civil rights marchers in Derry. The early 1970s were the most intense period of the Provisional IRA campaign. About half the total of 650 British soldiers to die in the conflict were killed in the years 1971‚Äì73.O'Brien, p. 135 In 1972 alone, the IRA killed 100 British soldiers and wounded 500 more. In the same year, they carried out 1,300 bomb attacks and 90 IRA members were killed.O'Brien, p. 119 Up to 1972, the IRA controlled large urban areas in Belfast and Derry, but these were eventually re-taken by a major British operation known as Operation Motorman. Thereafter, fortified police and military posts were built in republican areas throughout Northern Ireland. During the early 1970s, a typical IRA operation involved sniping at British patrols and engaging them in fire-fights in urban areas of Belfast and Derry. They also killed RUC and Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers, both on and off-duty, and a number of retired policemen and UDR soldiers. These tactics produced casualties for both sides and for many civilian bystanders. The British Army study of the conflict later described this period (1970‚Äì72), as the 'insurgency phase' of the IRA's campaign.Operation Banner ‚Äì An analysis of military operations in Northern Ireland, Chapter I, page 2 Another element of their campaign was the bombing of commercial targets such as shops and businesses. The most effective tactic the IRA developed for its bombing campaign was the car bomb, where large amounts of explosives were packed into a car, which was driven to its target and then detonated. Se√°n Mac St√≠of√°in, the first Chief of Staff of the Provisional IRA, described the car bomb both as a tactical and strategic weapon. From the tactical point of view, it tied down a great number of British troops in Belfast and other cities and major towns across Northern Ireland. Strategically, it hampered the British administration and government of the country, striking simultaneously at its economic structure. While most of the IRA's attacks on commercial targets were not intended to cause casualties, on many occasions they killed civilians. Examples include the bombing of the Abercorn restaurant in Belfast in March 1972, in which two young Catholic women were killed and 130 people injured, attributed to the IRA, which never acknowledged responsibility, as well as the bombing of the La Mon restaurant in County Down in February 1978, which resulted in the deaths of twelve Protestant civilian customers, and others maimed and injured.Mallie Bishop, p. 215, p. 337 In rural areas such as South Armagh (which is a majority Catholic area near the Irish border), the IRA unit's most effective weapon was the \\"culvert bomb\\", where bombs were planted under drains in country roads. This proved so dangerous for British Army patrols that virtually all troops in the area had to be transported by helicopter, a policy which continued until 2007, when the last British Army base was closed in South Armagh. Ceasefires ‚Äì 1972 and 1975 The Provisional IRA declared two ceasefires in the 1970s, temporarily suspending its armed operations. In 1972, the IRA leadership believed that Britain was on the verge of leaving Northern Ireland. The British government held secret talks with the Provisional IRA leadership in 1972 to try and secure a ceasefire based on a compromise settlement within Northern Ireland. The Provisional IRA agreed to a temporary ceasefire from 26 June to 9 July. In July 1972, Provisional leaders, Se√°n Mac St√≠of√°in, D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill, Ivor Bell, Seamus Twomey, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness met a British delegation led by William Whitelaw. The IRA leaders refused to consider a peace settlement that did not include a commitment to British withdrawal to be completed by 1975, a retreat of the British Army to barracks and a release of republican prisoners. The British refused and the talks ended.Taylor, p. 139 On Bloody Friday in July 1972 in Belfast 22 bombs exploded, killing nine people and injuring 130.Moloney, p. 116 Bloody Friday was intended to be a demonstration of IRA strength following the ceasefire, but was a disaster for the IRA due to the authorities being unable to deal with so many simultaneous bomb alerts in a small area.Moloney, p. 117 By the mid-1970s, it was clear that the hopes of the Provisional IRA leadership for a quick military victory were receding. Secret meetings between IRA leaders Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh and Billy McKee with British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees secured an IRA ceasefire from February 1975 until January of the next year. The republicans believed initially that this was the start of a long-term process of British withdrawal. However, after several months, many in the IRA came to believe that the British were trying to bring the Provisional movement into peaceful politics without giving them any guarantees. Critics of the IRA leadership, most notably Gerry Adams, felt that the ceasefire was disastrous for the IRA, leading to infiltration by British informers, the arrest of many activists and a breakdown in IRA discipline, which in turn led to tit-for-tat killings with loyalist groups fearful of a British sell-out and a feud with fellow republicans in the Official IRA. By early 1976, the IRA leadership, short of money, weapons and members, was on the brink of calling off the campaign.Taylor, pp. 232‚Äì233 Instead, the ceasefire broke down in January 1976.Taylor, p. 156 =Late 1970s and the \\"Long War\\"= The years 1976 to 1979 under Roy Mason, Merlyn Rees' replacement as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, were characterised by a falling death rate for many reasons, including a drop in loyalist violence (attributed to the absence of political initiatives under Mason), and a change in IRA tactics after its weakening during the previous year's ceasefire. Mason developed a policy that rejected a political or military solution in favour of treating paramilitary violence \\"as a security problem\\". In addition, RUC Chief Constable Kenneth Newman took advantage of Emergency Powers legislation to subject suspected IRA members to \\"intensive and frequently rough\\" seven-day interrogations.Bishop, Mallie, p321 British concentration on intelligence- gathering and recruiting of informers, accelerated during the 1975 ceasefire and continued under Mason, meant that arrests of IRA members rose steeply in this period. Between 1976 and 1979, 3,000 people were charged with \\"terrorist offences\\". There were 800 republican prisoners in Long Kesh alone by 1980.English, Armed Struggle, p191 In 1972, there were over 12,000 shooting and bombing attacks in Northern Ireland; by 1977, this was down to 2,800.Mallie, Bishop, p320-321 In 1976, there were 297 deaths in Northern Ireland; in the next three years the figures were 112, 81, and 113. An IRA man contended that \\"we were almost beaten by Mason\\", and Martin McGuinness commented: \\"Mason beat the shit out of us\\". Mason's policy of 'criminalisation' led to the blanket protest in the prisons. When Mason left office in 1979, he predicted the IRA were \\"weeks away from defeat\\". After the early years of the conflict, it became less common for the IRA to use large numbers of men in its armed actions. Instead, smaller but more specialised groups carried out sustained attritional attacks. In response to the 1975 ceasefire and the arrest of many IRA volunteers in its aftermath, the IRA re- organised their structures in 1977 into small cell-based units. While these were harder to infiltrate, the greater secrecy also caused a distance to develop between the IRA and sympathetic civilians. They also embarked on a strategy known as the \\"Long War\\" ‚Äì a process of attrition based on the indefinite continuation of an armed campaign until the British government grew tired of the political, military and financial costs involved in staying in Northern Ireland.Moloney, pp. 149‚Äì162 The British Army characterised this change in the IRA campaign as a move from \\"insurgency\\" to a \\"terrorist phase\\". The highest military death toll from an IRA attack came on 27 August 1979, with the Warrenpoint ambush in County Down, when 18 British soldiers from the Parachute Regiment were killed by two culvert bombs placed by the South Armagh Brigade, a unit that didn't feel the need to adopt the cell structure because of its history of successfully avoiding intelligence failures. On the same day, the IRA killed one of their most famous victims, The Earl Mountbatten of Burma, assassinated along with two teenagers (aged 14 and 15) and The Dowager Lady Brabourne in County Sligo, by a bomb placed in his boat. Another effective IRA tactic devised in the late 1970s was the use of home-made mortars mounted on the back of trucks which were fired at police and army bases. These mortars were first tested in 1974 but did not kill anyone until 1979. Sectarian attacks The IRA argued that its campaign was aimed not at Protestant and unionist people, but at the British presence in Northern Ireland, manifested in the state security forces. However, many unionists argue that the IRA's campaign was sectarian and there are many incidents where the organisation targeted Protestant civilians. The 1970s were the most violent years of the Troubles. As well as its campaign against the security forces, the IRA became involved, in the middle of the decade, in a \\"tit for tat\\" cycle of sectarian killings with loyalist paramilitaries. The worst examples of this occurred in 1975 and 1976. In September 1975, for example, IRA members machine-gunned an Orange Hall in Newtownhamilton, killing five Protestants. On 5 January 1976, in Armagh, IRA members operating under the proxy name South Armagh Republican Action Force shot dead ten Protestant building workers in the Kingsmill massacre.English, p. 172 In similar incidents, the IRA deliberately killed 91 Protestant civilians in 1974‚Äì76. The IRA did not officially claim the killings, but justified them in a statement on 17 January 1976, \\"The Irish Republican Army has never initiated sectarian killings ...[but] if loyalist elements responsible for over 300 sectarian assassinations in the past four years stop such killing now, then the question of retaliation from whatever source does not arise\\".English, p. 173 In late 1976, the IRA leadership met with representatives of the loyalist paramilitary groups and agreed to halt random sectarian killings and car bombings of civilian targets. The loyalists revoked the agreement in 1979, after the IRA killing of Lord Mountbatten, but the pact nevertheless halted the cycle of sectarian revenge killings until the late 1980s, when the loyalist groups began killing Catholics again in large numbers.Mallie Bishop, p. 390 After the British introduced their policy of \\"Ulsterisation\\" from the mid-1970s, IRA victims came increasingly from the ranks of the RUC and Ulster Defence Regiment, including off-duty and retired personnel. Most of these were Protestant and unionist, thus the killings were portrayed and perceived by many as a campaign of sectarian assassination. Historian Henry Patterson said about Fermanagh \\"that the killings struck at the Protestant community‚Äôs morale, sense of security and belonging in the area was undeniable.\\" while Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley claimed that the IRA campaign in Fermanagh was \\"genocidal\\".Bowden, Brett and Davis, Michael T. (2008). Terror: From Tyrannicide to Terrorism. University of Queensland Press, p. 239; Rachel Kowalsaki argues that the IRA did not generally engage in sectarian activities but instead targeted those they deemed responsible for British rule in Northern Ireland and that they generally only targeted members of the military and police and made efforts to avoid civilian deaths. However, Kowalsaki notes that the PIRA did not recognise that while they may have thought of themselves as fighting for a united Ireland, their actions were often perceived by the Northern Irish Unionists as sectarian attacks against Protestants.Kowalski, Rachel Caroline. \\"The role of sectarianism in the Provisional IRA campaign, 1969‚Äì1997.\\" Terrorism and political violence 30, no. 4 (2018): 658-683. A similar argument was made by Lewis et al, who argue that the PIRA's ideology - which held that Irish Protestants and Unionists were part of the imagined community of the Irish nation and were simply deluded into thinking themselves British by colonial oppression - meant that the organisation had an ideological restraint against mass sectarianism. However, the authors note that this same belief could also blind them to the actual effects of their campaign, as they did not acknowledge that Northern Irish Unionists regarded themselves as a distinct community and thus would perceive the PIRA's activities as sectarian.Lewis, Matthew, and Shaun McDaid. \\"Bosnia on the border? Republican Violence in Northern Ireland during the 1920s and 1970s.\\" Terrorism and political violence 29, no. 4 (2017): 635-655. Timothy Shanahan argues that while the IRA did launch attacks against legitimate targets (defined as members of the security services), many members of the security services, such as the RUC and UDR, would themselves be Protestant, and would be presumed to be Protestant by the IRA. Thus any attacks on these legitimate targets would suffice in killing members of the Protestant community, negating any need for sectarian attacks on Protestant civilians. Shanahan thus argues that while the IRA may not have been sectarian as some loyalist paramilitaries, it may not have been as anti-sectarian as popularly claimed.Shanahan, Timothy. Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Morality of Terrorism. Edinburgh University Press, 2008, pp.32-39 Similar arguments were made by Steve Bruce, who also argued that Catholic RUC members were disproportionately targeted, which Bruce argues is because they were viewed as betraying their community, which only makes sense in the nature of a sectarian conflict.Bruce, Steve. The Edge of the Union: The Ulster Loyalist Political Vision: The Ulster Loyalist Political Vision. Oxford University Press, UK, 1994, p.124-126 James Dingley argues that the IRA's focus on the idea of a united and independent Ireland made it de facto sectarian, as it did not recognise Ulster Unionists as a legitimate group and wanted to use violence to pursue goals that were opposed by the majority of the Northern Irish population.Dingley, James. \\"A reply to white's non‚Äêsectarian thesis of PIRA targeting.\\" (1998): 106-117. Protestants in the rural border areas of counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, where the number of members of the security forces killed was high, viewed the IRA's campaign as ethnic cleansing. These views have been challenged. Boyle and Hadden argue that the allegations do not stand up to serious scrutiny,Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden, Northern Ireland: The Choice, Harmondsworth:UK, Penguin Books, 1994, p. 7. while nationalists object to the term on the grounds that it is not used by unionists to describe similar killings or expulsions of Catholics in areas where they form a minority.Bowden and Davis, p. 239 Henry Patterson, professor of politics at the University of Ulster, concludes that while the IRA's campaign was unavoidably sectarian, it did not amount to ethnic cleansing. Although the IRA did not specifically target these people because of their religious affiliation, more Protestants joined the security forces so many people from that community believed the attacks were sectarian. IRA volunteer Tommy McKearney argues that due to the British government's Ulsterisation policy increasing the role of the locally recruited RUC and UDR, the IRA had no choice but to target them because of their local knowledge, but acknowledges that Protestants viewed this as a sectarian attack on their community. Gerry Adams, in a 1988 interview, claimed it was, \\"vastly preferable\\" to target the regular British Army as it \\"removes the worst of the agony from Ireland\\" and \\"diffuses the sectarian aspects of the conflict because loyalists do not see it as an attack on their community\\".Taylor, p. 337 Towards the end of the Troubles, the IRA widened their campaign even further, to include the killing of people who worked in a civilian capacity with the RUC and British Army. These workers were mostly, but not exclusively, Protestant, although Catholic judges, magistrates, and contractors were also assassinated by the IRA. In 1992 an IRA bomb killed eight Protestant building workers who were working on a British Army base at Teebane. Attacks outside Northern Ireland =England= 1970s The Provisional IRA was chiefly active in Northern Ireland, but from the early 1970s, it also took its bombing campaign to England. At a meeting of the Provisional IRA Army Council in June 1972, Se√°n Mac St√≠of√°in proposed bombing targets in England to \\"take the heat off Belfast and Derry\\". However, the Army Council did not consent to a bombing campaign in England until early 1973, after talks with the British government the previous year had broken down.Mallie Bishop, p. 250 They believed that such bombing would help create a demand among the British public for their government to withdraw from Northern Ireland.English, pp. 163‚Äì64 The first IRA team sent to England included eleven members of the Belfast Brigade, who hijacked four cars in Belfast, fitted them with explosives and drove them to London via Dublin and Liverpool. The team were reported to the London Metropolitan Police and all but one of them were arrested. Nevertheless, two of the bombs exploded, killing one man and injuring 180 people.Mallie Bishop, p. 253 Thereafter, control over IRA bombings in England was given to Brian Keenan from Belfast. Keenan directed Peter McMullen, a former member of the British Parachute Regiment, to carry out a series of bombings in 1973. A bomb planted by McMullen exploded at a barracks in Yorkshire, injuring a female canteen worker.Mallie Bishop, p. 255 On 23 September 1973, a British soldier died of wounds six days after being injured while attempting to defuse an IRA bomb outside an office block in Birmingham. Some of the most indiscriminate bombing attacks and killings of the IRA's bombing campaign were carried out by a unit of eight IRA members, which included the Balcombe Street Gang, who were sent to London in early 1974.The Enemy Within by Martin Dillon (), page 141Bowyer Bell, page 424 They avoided contact with the Irish community there in order to remain inconspicuous and aimed to carry out one attack a week. In addition to bombings, they carried out several assassination attempts. Ross McWhirter, a right wing politician who had offered a ¬£50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the bombers, was shot dead at his home. The group later made an assassination attempt on Edward Heath.The Road To Balcombe Street: The IRA Reign of Terror in London by Steven Moysey (), pages 116‚Äì17 They were eventually arrested after a machine-gun attack on an exclusive restaurant on Mayfair. Pursued by police, they took two hostages (a married couple) and barricaded themselves for six days in a flat on Balcombe Street before they surrendered, an incident known as the Balcombe Street Siege. They were sentenced to thirty years each for a total of six murders.Mallie Bishop, p. 257 At their trial, the group admitted responsibility for the Guildford pub bombings of 5 October 1974, which killed five people (four of whom were off- duty soldiers) and injured 54, as well as the bombing of a pub in Woolwich, which killed another two people and injured 28. On 21 November 1974, two pubs were bombed in the Birmingham pub bombings (an act widely attributed to the IRA, but not claimed by them), which killed 21 civilians and injured 162. An inadequate warning was given for one bomb and no warning for the other.English, p. 169 There were no military targets associated with either of the pubs. The Guildford Four and Maguire Seven, and the Birmingham Six, were imprisoned for the Guildford and Birmingham bombings, respectively, but each group protested their innocence. They were eventually exonerated and released after serving lengthy prison sentences, even though the Balcombe Street group had admitted responsibility long before. 1980s After the campaign of the mid-1970s, the IRA did not undertake a major bombing campaign again in England until the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, throughout the intervening period, they did carry out a number of high-profile bombing attacks in England. In October 1981 the IRA carried out the Chelsea Barracks bombing, the nail bomb was aimed at soldiers returning to Chelsea Barracks, but the blast killed two civilians passing by, 40 people were injured in the attack including 23 British soldiers.https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/world/london-bomb-kills-o-ne- hurts-up-to-50.htmlhttp://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=10&month;=10&year;=1981 The same month a British bomb disposal expert Kenneth Robert Howorth, was killed trying to defuse an IRA bomb on Oxford Street, London.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922647,00.html In 1982 the Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings killed 11 soldiers and wounded some 50 soldiers and civilians at a British Army ceremonial parade at Hyde Park, and a British Army band performance in Regent's Park in London. In 1984, in the Brighton hotel bombing, the IRA tried to assassinate British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet. She survived, but five people including Sir Anthony Berry, a Conservative Party Member of Parliament, Eric Taylor, the northwest party chairman, and three wives (Muriel Maclean, Jeanne Shattock, and Roberta Wakeham) of party officials were killed. Margaret Tebbit, wife of Norman Tebbit, was left permanently disabled. In 1985 the IRA planned a sustained bombing campaign in London and English seaside resorts including Bournemouth, Southend and Great Yarmouth. The IRA planned for bombs to explode on sixteen consecutive days beginning in July, excluding Sundays. As well as damaging the tourist industry, the IRA hope to take advantage of police resources being stretched and launch an assassination campaign against political and military targets including General Frank Kitson. Patrick Magee, who was wanted in connection with the Brighton hotel bombing after his palm print was found on the hotel register, was under police surveillance who hoped he would lead them to other IRA members. He met with an IRA member at Carlisle railway station, and they were followed to Glasgow, where they was arrested on 24 June 1985 at a safe house along with three other people, including Martina Anderson and Gerry McDonnell, who had escaped from the Maze Prison in 1983. On 11 June 1986 they were sentenced for conspiring to cause explosions and received life sentences, Magee was also convicted of the Brighton hotel bombing and received a life sentence with a minimum recommended sentence of 35 years. On several more occasions, the Provisional IRA attacked British troops stationed in England, the most lethal of which was the Deal barracks bombing, in which 11 Royal Marines Band Service bandsmen were killed in 1989. Republicans argued that these bombings \\"concentrated minds\\" in the British government far more than the violence in Northern Ireland. The IRA made a point of only striking at targets in England (not Scotland or Wales), although they once planted a small bomb on an oil terminal in the Shetland Isles in May 1981 on the same day that Queen Elizabeth II was attending a nearby function to mark the opening of the terminal. The bomb detonated, damaging a boiler but no one was injured and the ceremony continued. During the IRA's 25-year campaign in England, 115 deaths and 2,134 injuries were reported, from a total of almost 500 incidents. Early 1990s Between 1977 and 1989 there was no year in which IRA attacks in England occurred on more than four days. In the early 1990s the IRA intensified the bombing campaign in England, planting 15 bombs in 1990, 36 in 1991, and 57 in 1992. In February 1991 three mortar rounds were fired at the British Prime minister's office in Downing Street in London during a Cabinet meeting, which was a propaganda boost for the IRA. During this period, the IRA also launched a highly damaging economic bombing campaign in English cities, particularly London, which caused a huge amount of physical and economic damage to property. Among their targets were the City of London, Bishopsgate and Baltic Exchange in London, with the Bishopsgate bombing causing damage initially estimated at ¬£1 billion and the Baltic Exchange bombing ¬£800 milion of damage.Provos The IRA & Sinn F√©in, p. 327. A particularly notorious bombing was the Warrington bomb attack in 1993, which killed two young children, Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball. In early March 1994, there were three mortar attacks on Heathrow Airport in London, which forced the authorities to shut it down. It has been argued that this bombing campaign convinced the British government (who had hoped to contain the conflict to Northern Ireland with its Ulsterisation policy) to negotiate with Sinn F√©in after the IRA ceasefires of August 1994 and July 1997. =Elsewhere= The Provisional IRA also carried out attacks in other countries such as West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where British soldiers were based. Between 1979 and 1990, eight unarmed soldiers and six civilians died in these attacks, including the British Ambassador to the Netherlands Sir Richard Sykes and his valet, Karel Straub. In May 1988 the IRA killed three RAF men & injured three others in two separate attacks in the Netherlands. On one occasion, the IRA shot dead two Australian tourists in the Netherlands, claiming its members mistook them for off-duty British soldiers. On another occasion an IRA gunman shot dead Heidi Hazell, a German woman, as she sat alone in her car.Thatcher, Margaret (1997). The collected speeches of Margaret Thatcher. HarperCollins Publishers, p. 357; She was parked near a British Army married quarter in Unna. They claimed she had been shot \\"in the belief that she was a member of the British Army garrison at Dortmund\\". Her husband was a British Army staff sergeant. Hans Engelhard, West Germany's justice minister called it \\"the insane act of a blind fanatic.\\" The IRA also sent members on arms importation, logistical support and intelligence operations at different times to continental Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia, Africa, Western Asia and Latin America. On at least one occasion IRA members traveled to Colombia.The Daily Telegraph, 14 Aug 2001, \\"Three Suspected IRA Men Arrested In Colombia\\" ; retrieved 3 March 2013. Libyan arms An AK-47 rifle, over 1,000 of which were smuggled by Muammar Gaddafi to the Provisional IRA in the 1980s In the mid-1980s, the Provisional IRA received large quantities of modern weaponry, including heavy weaponry such as heavy machine guns, over 1,000 rifles, several hundred handguns, rocket-propelled grenades, flamethrowers, surface-to-air missiles and the plastic explosive Semtex, from the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi. There were four successful shipments between 1985 and 1986; three of these trips were carried out by the trawler Casamara and a fourth by the oil-rig replenisher Villa. All told, they brought in 110 tons of weaponry.Harnden, pp. 239‚Äì45Geraghty, p. 182O'Brien, p. 137 A fifth arms cargo on board the coaster Eksund was intercepted by the French Navy in 1987. This brought the Provisional IRA's new capability to the attention of the authorities on either side of the Irish border. Five men were captured with the boat; three IRA members, including Gabriel Cleary, received jail sentences.Moloney, pp. 18‚Äì23 Reportedly, Gaddafi donated enough weapons to arm the equivalent of two infantry battalions. The IRA therefore came to be very well armed in the latter part of the Troubles. Most of the losses it inflicted on the British Army, however, occurred in the early 1970s, although they continued to cause substantial casualties to the British military, the RUC and UDR throughout the conflict. According to author Ed Moloney, the IRA Army Council had plans for a dramatic escalation of the conflict in the late 1980s, which they likened to the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam War, with the aid of the arms obtained from Libya. The plan had been to take and hold several areas along the border, forcing the British Army to either withdraw from border areas or use maximum force to re-take them ‚Äì thus escalating the conflict beyond the point which the Provisional IRA thought that British public opinion would accept.Moloney, pages 20 to 22 However, this offensive failed to materialise. IRA sources quoted in the Secret History of the IRA by Ed Moloney say that the interception of the Eksund shipment eliminated the element of surprise which they had hoped to have for this offensive. The role of informers within the IRA seems to have also played a role in the failure of the \\"Tet Offensive\\" to get off the ground. Nevertheless, the shipments which got through enabled the IRA to begin a vigorous campaign in the 1980s.Welch, Robert and Stewart, Bruce (1996). The Oxford companion to Irish literature. Oxford University Press, p. 396; The success of the arms smuggling was a defeat for British intelligence and marked a turning point in the conflict in Northern Ireland.Geraghty, p. 183 The Libyan weaponry allowed the IRA to wage war indefinitely.Taylor, p. 323 Samples of Semtex-H and C4 plastic explosives In the event, much of the IRA's new heavy weaponry, for instance the surface- to-air missiles (SAMs) and flamethrowers, were never, or very rarely, used. The only recorded use of flamethrowers took place in the attack in Derryard, County Fermanagh, when two soldiers were killed when a permanent checkpoint manned by the King's Own Scottish Borderers was the target of a multiple weapons attack on 13 December 1989. The SAMs turned out to be out of date models, unable to shoot down British helicopters equipped with anti-missile technology.Taylor, pp. 277‚Äì278 The missiles were eventually rendered useless when their batteries wore out.Moloney, p. 569 The Semtex plastic explosive proved the most valuable addition to the IRA's armoury.Moloney, p. 23 As it was, the numbers of members of the British and Northern Ireland military personnel killed by the IRA increased in the years 1988‚Äì1990, from 12 in 1986 to 39 in 1988, but dropped to 27 in 1989 and decreased again to 18 in 1990. The death toll by 1991 was similar to that of the mid-1980s, with 14 fatalities. 32 members of the RUC were killed in the same period. By the late 1980s, the Provisional IRA, in the judgement of journalist and author Brendan O'Brien, \\"could not be beaten, it could be contained\\". Politically and militarily, that was the most significant factor.O'Brien, p. 158. 'Sickening' is derived from a speech Martin McGuinness made in 1988, when he said, \\"I believe the...Irish Republican Army has got the capability, the ways and the means of bringing about the defeat of the British forces, both militarily and politically in the Six Counties. But in saying that I am not saying that the IRA have the ability to drive every last British soldier out of Belfast, Derry...or anywhere else. But they have the ability to sicken the British forces of occupation\\", cited in O'Brien, p. 152 By the late 1980s and early 1990s, roughly nine out of every ten IRA attacks were aborted or failed to cause casualties.O'Brien, p. 157 Republican sources such as Mitchel McLaughlin and Danny Morrison argued that by the early 1990s, the Provisional IRA could not attain their objectives by purely military means.Interviewer \\"Did you actually say that to the IRA-that they weren't going to drive the British out of Ireland?\\" McLaughlin \\"I probably didn't use that language but certainly I used that rationale on more than one occasion, yes.\\" Taylor, pp. 365‚Äì66 A campaign to pressure Libya to pay compensation to IRA victims was derailed by the Libyan Crisis. Incidents with British special forces The IRA suffered some heavy losses at the hands of British special forces like the Special Air Service (SAS), the heaviest being the killing of eight IRA members in the Loughgall Ambush in 1987, as they attempted to destroy the Loughgall RUC station. The East Tyrone Brigade was hit particularly hard by British killings of their members in this period, losing 28 members killed by British forces in the period 1987‚Äì1992, out of 53 dead in the whole conflict.Moloney, p. 319 In many of these cases, Provisional IRA members were killed after being ambushed by British special forces. Some authors alleged that this amounted to a campaign of assassination on the part of state forces (see shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland). Another high-profile incident took place in Gibraltar in March 1988, when three unarmed IRA members were shot dead by an SAS unit while scouting out a bombing target (see Operation Flavius).Moloney, p. 330 The subsequent funerals of these IRA members in Belfast were attacked by loyalist gunman Michael Stone. At a funeral of one of Stone's victims, two plainsclothes British Army corporals were abducted, beaten and shot dead by the IRA after driving into the funeral procession (see Corporals killings).O'Brien, p. 164 There were, however, a number of incidents in which undercover operations ended in failure, such as a shoot-out at the village of Cappagh on 24 March 1990, where plain-clothes members of the security forces were ambushed by an IRA unit, and Operation Conservation, which was thwarted by the IRA's South Armagh Brigade and one British soldier was shot dead in a counter-ambush. On 2 May 1980, Joe Doherty, Angelo Fusco, Paul Magee and another IRA member were arrested after being cornered by the SAS in a house in Belfast. SAS commander Captain Herbert Westmacott was hit by machine gun fire and killed instantly. Loyalists and the IRA ‚Äì killing and reprisals The IRA and Sinn F√©in suffered from a campaign of assassination launched against their members by loyalist paramilitaries from the late 1980s. These attacks killed about 12 IRA and 15 Sinn F√©in members between 1987 and 1994.Geraghty, p. 320 This tactic was unusual as the vast majority of loyalist victims were Catholic civilians. In addition, loyalists killed family members of known republicans; John (or Jack) McKearney and his nephew, Kevin McKearney, and Kevin's parents-in-law, Charles and Teresa Fox (whose son, Peter, was an IRA volunteer) were all targeted by the UVF. Two of Kevin's brothers, P√°draig and Sean, were IRA volunteers killed during the Troubles.Taylor, Peter (2000). Loyalists. p. 213. Bloomsbury; . According to recently released documents, British military intelligence stated in a secret 1973 draft report that within the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) it was likely there were soldiers who were also loyalist paramilitaries. Despite knowing this, the British Government stepped up the role of the UDR in \\"maintaining order\\" within Northern Ireland. British Government documents released on 3 May 2006 show that overlapping membership between British Army units like the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) and loyalist paramilitary groups was a wider problem than a \\"few bad apples\\" as was often claimed. The documents include a draft report titled \\"Subversion in the UDR\\" which detailed the problem. In 1973; an estimated 5‚Äì15% of UDR soldiers were directly linked to loyalist paramilitary groups, it was believed that the \\"best single source of weapons, and the only significant source of modern weapons, for Protestant extremist groups was the UDR\\", it was feared UDR troops were loyal to \\"Ulster\\" alone rather than to \\"Her Majesty's Government\\", the British Government knew that UDR weapons were being used in the assassination and attempted assassination of Roman Catholic civilians by loyalist paramilitaries. Loyalists were aided in this campaign by elements of the security forces, including the British Army and RUC Special Branch (see Stevens Report). Loyalist sources have since confirmed that they received intelligence files on republicans from members of British Army and police intelligence in this period. A British Army agent within the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), Brian Nelson, was convicted in 1992 of the killings of Catholic civilians. It was later revealed that Nelson, while working as a British Army agent, was also involved in the importation of arms for loyalists from South Africa in 1988.O'Brien, p. 231 In 1993, for the first time since the 1960s, loyalist paramilitaries killed two more people than republican paramilitaries. In 1994, loyalists killed eleven more people than republicans, and in 1995, they killed twelve more. In the latter case (1995 period), the Provisional IRA 1994's cease-fire was still in place. In response to these attacks, the IRA began a reactive assassination campaign against leading members of the UDA and UVF. By the late 1980s, the IRA Army Council would not sanction attacks on Protestant areas with a high likelihood of civilian casualties, but only on named, identified loyalist targets. The main reason for this was the negative impact of attacks on civilians on the republican movement's electoral appeal. The IRA issued a statement in 1986 saying: \\"At no time will we involve ourselves in the execution of ordinary Protestants, but at all times we reserve the right to take armed action against those who attempt to terrorise or intimidate our people into accepting British/unionist rule\\".English, p. 246 Gerry Adams stressed his party's point of view in 1989; \\"Sinn F√©in does not condone the deaths of people who are non- combatants\\".Moloney, p. 321 To maximise the impact of the tactic, the IRA targeted senior loyalist paramilitary figures. Among the leading loyalists killed were John McMichael, Joe Bratty, Raymond Elder and Ray Smallwoods of the UDA and John Bingham and Robert Seymour of the UVF.O'Brien, p. 314 Mechanic Leslie Dallas, shot dead by the IRA along with two elderly Protestants in 1989, was also claimed by the IRA to be a member of the UVFMoloney, p. 314 but his family and the UVF denied this. He is listed in the Sutton Index as a civilian. One IRA bomb on 23 October 1993 caused civilian casualties, when a bomb was planted at a Shankill Road fish shop. The bomb was intended to kill the entire senior leadership of the UDA, including Johnny Adair, who sometimes met in a room above the shop. Instead, the bomb killed eight Protestant civilians, a low-level UDA member and also one of the bombers, Thomas Begley, when the device exploded prematurely. In addition, 58 more people were injured.Coogan, p. 437 This provoked a series of retaliatory killings by the UVF and UDA of Catholic civilians with no political or paramilitary connections.Moloney, p. 415 According to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), University of Ulster statistics, the Provisional IRA killed 30 loyalist paramilitaries in total. Lost Lives gives a figure of 28Lost Lives, p. 1536 out of a total number of loyalists killed in the Troubles of 126.Lost Lives, p. 1531 According to The Irish War by Tony Geraghty, the IRA killed 45 loyalists.Geraghty, p. 235 These killings intensified just before the IRA ceasefire of 1994, with UDA members Ray Smallwoods being killed on 11 July, Joe Bratty & Raymond Elder on 31 July & a UVF commander Billy Wright had been seriously injured by the IRA in June. As well as these IRA killings the other Republican paramilitary the Irish National Liberation Army killed three UVF men during the same period including UVF Belfast commander Trevor King. The loyalist groups called their ceasefire six weeks after the IRA ceasefire of that year and they argued that it was the killing of Catholic civilians and republicans that had forced the IRA ceasefire by placing intolerable pressure on nationalists, a view echoed by former deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, John Taylor, Baron Kilclooney.Taylor, Peter (2000). Loyalists. p.231-232, p.234. Bloomsbury; . Campaign up to and after the 1994 ceasefire =Early 1990s= The improvised mortar was the weapon of choice for the Provisional IRA during the 1990s. By the early 1990s, although the death toll had dropped significantly from the worst years of the 1970s, the IRA campaign continued to severely disrupt normal life in Northern Ireland. *In 1987, the IRA carried out almost 300 shooting and bombing attacks, killing 31 RUC, UDR and British Army personnel and 20 civilians, while injuring 100 security forces and 150 civilians. *In 1990, IRA attacks killed 30 soldiers and RUC members and injured 340.O'Brien, p. 203Sutton index. See the following link for the 1990 fatalities and produce tabulation by introducing Status and Year: *CAIN Sutton Index of deaths *In 1992, the figure for IRA attacks was 426.O'Brien, p. 168 The IRA was capable of carrying on with a significant level of violence for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, the goal of the British government in the 1980s was to destroy the IRA, rather than find a political solution.Operation Banner: An analysis of military operations in Northern Ireland. Prepared under the direction of the Chief of the General Staff, Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), July 2006, Chapter II, page 15: \\"The British Government's main military objective in the 1980s was the destruction of PIRA, rather than resolving the conflict.\\" Moreover, in addition to those killed and injured, the conflict had a substantial economic cost. The UK had to devote an enormous budget to keep their security system in Northern Ireland running indefinitely.\\"These statistics [about the declining violence] do not trivialize the seriousness of the problem, but instead indicate that terrorist violence was contained at manageable levels. What these statistics fail to indicate was the expense of the conflict. Perpetually deploying large, well- trained security forces was very expensive in simple monetary terms.\\" Journalist Kevin Toolis states that from 1985 onward, the IRA carried out a five-year campaign against RUC and Army bases that resulted in 33 British security facilities destroyed and nearly a hundred seriously damaged.Toolis, Kevin (1995). Rebel Hearts: journeys within the IRA's soul. Picador, p. 53; The attacks and bombings in the early 1990s forced the UK government to dismantle several bases and security posts, whose maintenance or reconstruction was not affordable.The list included: * Three permanent checkpoints: **Boa Island (1991) **Derryard (1991) The Irish Emigrant, March 1991 issue **Cloghogue (1991) (Harnden, p. 263-264) * The UDR base at Glenane The presence of the British Army in the region increased from its lowest ebb of 9,000 men in 1985 to 10,500 by 1992 after an escalation of the IRA's mortar attacks.Ripley, Tim and Chappel, Mike: Security forces in Northern Ireland (1969‚Äì92). Osprey, 1993, p. 20. In South Armagh, in contrast to other brigade areas, IRA activity increased in the early 1990s. Travelling by road in South Armagh became so dangerous for the British Army that by 1975 they began using helicopters to transport troops and supply its bases, a practice continued until the late 1990s.Harnden, p. 19 The IRA there shot down five helicopters (one in 1978,Dewar, Michael (1985). The British Army in Northern Ireland. Arms and Armour Press, p. 156; another one in 1988 and 1991 and two in 1994), and damaged at least another three in this period, using DShK heavy machine guns and improvised mortars.Harnden, pp. 361, 398 Another one was brought down in early 1990 in County Tyrone by the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade, wounding three crew members.See this two-pages British Commons account about the NI violence for the period of 1989‚Äì90: *10 July 1990, p.1 *10 July 1990, p.2 Copter forced down in Ulster New York Times, 12 February 1990 One of several methods the IRA used to counter British body armour was the use of high velocity Barrett Light 50 and Belgian FN sniper rifles, several of which the IRA imported from the USA. Two snipers teams of the South Armagh Brigade killed nine members of the security forces in this way. To avoid the jamming of wireless-triggered detonators, the organisation began to employ radar beacons to prime their explosive devices, improving dramatically the effectiveness of the attacks.Harnden, p. 265.Geraghty. p. 209. By 1992, the use of long-range weapons like mortars and heavy machine guns by the IRA had forced the British Army to build its checkpoints one to five miles from the border in order to avoid attacks launched from the Republic. Another IRA technique used in 1990 on three occasions was the \\"proxy bomb\\", where a victim was kidnapped and forced to drive a car bomb to its target. All three victims were Catholic men employed by the security forces. Their families were held hostage to ensure the proxies did as they were directed. The first proxy, at Coshquin (near Derry), died, along with six soldiers. The second proxy, at Cloghoge (or Cloghogue; near Newry), escaped but a soldier was killed. The third incident, at Omagh, produced no casualties due to a faulty detonator. This practice was stopped, reportedly due to the revulsion it caused among nationalists.English, pp. 347‚Äì50 In the early 1990s the IRA intensified its campaign against commercial and economic targets in Northern Ireland. For example, in May 1993 over four days the IRA detonated car bombs in Belfast, Portadown, and Magherafelt, County Londonderry, causing millions of pounds worth of damage.Fortnight Magazine, Issue 319-323, p. 33. Fortnight Publications, 1993. On 1 January 1994, the IRA planted eleven incendiary devices in shops and other premises in the Greater Belfast area in a \\"firebomb blitz\\" that caused millions of pounds worth of damage. =The ceasefires= In August 1994, the Provisional IRA announced a \\"complete cessation of military operations\\". This was the culmination of several years of negotiations between the Republican leadership, led by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, various figures in the local political parties, the Irish government and British government. It was informed by the view that neither the UK forces, nor the IRA could win the conflict and that greater progress towards Republican objectives might be achieved by negotiation. The devastation on Corporation Street in Manchester after the IRA bombing of 1996 While many Provisional IRA volunteers were reportedly unhappy with the end of armed struggle short of the achievement of a united Ireland, the peace strategy has since resulted in substantial electoral and political gains for Sinn F√©in, the movement's political wing. It may now be argued that the Sinn F√©in political party has eclipsed the Provisional IRA as the most important part of the republican movement. The ceasefire of 1994 therefore, while not a definitive end to Provisional IRA operations, marked the effective end of its full scale armed campaign. The Provisional IRA called off its 1994 ceasefire on 9 February 1996 because of its dissatisfaction with the state of negotiations. They signaled the end of the ceasefire by detonating a truck bomb at Canary Wharf in London, which caused the deaths of two civilians and massive damage to property. In the summer of 1996, another truck bomb devastated Manchester city centre. However, the Provisional IRA campaign after the ceasefire was suspended during this period and never reached the intensity of previous years. In total, the IRA killed 2 British soldiers, 2 RUC officers, 2 British civilians, and 1 Garda in 1996‚Äì1997 according to the CAIN project.Moloney, p. 459 They resumed their ceasefire on 19 July 1997. These Provisional IRA military activities of 1996‚Äì97 were widely believed to have been used to gain leverage in negotiations with the British government during the period.O'Brien, pp. 370‚Äì371 Whereas in 1994‚Äì95, the British Conservative Party government had refused to enter public talks with Sinn F√©in until the IRA had given up its weapons, the Labour Party government in power by 1997 was prepared to include Sinn F√©in in peace talks before IRA decommissioning. This precondition was officially dropped in June 1997.Maillot Agn√®s (2005). New Sinn F√©in: Irish republicanism in the twenty-first century. Routledge, p. 32; Another widespread interpretation of the temporary breakdown in the first IRA ceasefire is that the leadership of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness tolerated a limited return to violence in order to avoid a split between hardliners and moderates in the IRA Army Council. Nevertheless, they emphasized in every public statement since the fall of 1996 the need for a second truce. Once they had won over or removed the militarists from the council, they re-instated the ceasefire. Casualties According to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), a research project at the University of Ulster, the IRA was responsible for at least 1,705 deaths, about 48% of the total conflict deaths. Of that figure: *1,009 (59.2%) were members or former members of the British security forces, including: **697 British military personnel: 644 from the British Army (including the Ulster Defence Regiment/Royal Irish Regiment), 4 from the Royal Air Force, 1 from the Royal Navy, and 43 former British military personnel. (choose \\"organization\\" and \\"status\\" as the variables) **312 British law enforcement personnel: 270 Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers, 14 former RUC officers, 20 Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) officers, 2 former NIPS officers, and 6 English police officers. *508 (29%) were classed as civilians, including 17 political activists. *133 (7.8%) were members of the IRA, killed as informers or in premature explosions of bombs. *39 (2.2%) were loyalist paramilitary members: 26 Ulster Defence Association (UDA) members, 12 Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) members and 1 Red Hand Commando (RHC) member. *8 (0.4%) were members of the Irish security forces, including 6 Garda√≠, 1 Irish Prison Service officer, and 1 Irish Army soldier. *5 (0.2%) were members of other republican paramilitary groups: 4 Official IRA members and 1 IPLO member. Another detailed study, Lost Lives, states the Provisional IRA was responsible for the deaths of 1,781 people up to 2004. It says that, of this figure: *944 (53%) were members of the British security forces, including: 638 British military (including the UDR), 273 Royal Ulster Constabulary (including RUC reserve), 23 Northern Ireland Prison Service officers, five British police officers and five former British soldiers. *644 (36%) were civilians. *163 (9%) were Republican paramilitary members (including IRA members, most caused their own deaths when bombs they were transporting exploded prematurely). *28 (1.5%) were loyalist paramilitary members. *7 (0.3%) were members of the Irish security forces (6 Garda√≠ and one Irish Army). Lost Lives states that 294 Provisional IRA members died in the Troubles. The IRA lost 276 members during the Troubles according to the CAIN figures. In addition, a number of Sinn F√©in activists or councillors were killed, some of whom were also IRA members. An Phoblacht gives a figure of 341 IRA and Sinn F√©in members killed in the Troubles, indicating between 50‚Äì60 Sinn F√©in deaths if the IRA deaths are subtracted.O'Brien, p. 26 About 120 Provisional IRA members caused their own deaths, almost all when they were killed by their own explosives in premature bombing accidents ‚Äì 103 deaths according to CAIN, 105 according to an RUC report of 1993. Nine IRA members died on hunger strike.Lost Lives, p. 1479 Lost Lives gives a figure of 163 killings of republican paramilitary members (this includes bombing accidents and feuds with republicans from other organisations). Of the remaining 200 or so IRA dead, around 150 were killed by the British Army, with the remainder killed by loyalist paramilitaries, the RUC and the UDR. Far more common than the killing of IRA volunteers however, was their imprisonment. Journalists Eamonn Mallie and Patrick Bishop estimate in The Provisional IRA (1988), that between 8‚Äì10,000 Provisional IRA members were, up until that point, imprisoned during the course of the conflict, a number they also give as the total number of IRA members during the Troubles. The total number of Provisional IRA members imprisoned must be higher, once the figures from 1988 onwards are included. Assessments IRA poster = British Army official report = An internal British Army document released under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in 2007 stated an expert opinion that the British Army had failed to defeat the IRA by force of arms but also claims to have \\"shown the IRA that it could not achieve its ends through violence\\".Jackson, Mike (2006). Operation Banner: An Analysis of Military Operations in Northern Ireland . MoD, Army Code 71842 The report examined 37 years of British troop deployment and was compiled following a six-month study by a team of three officers carried out in early 2006 for General Sir Mike Jackson, the British Army's Chief of the General Staff. The military assessment describes the IRA as \\"professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient\\".Chapter I, page 3 The paper divides the IRA activity and tactics in two main periods: The \\"insurgency\\" phase (1971‚Äì1972), and the \\"terrorist\\" phase (1972‚Äì1997).Operation Banner, Chapter I, page 2 The British Army claims to have curbed the IRA insurgency by 1972, after Operation Motorman. The IRA then reemerged as a cell-structured organisation. The report also asserts that the government efforts by the 1980s were aimed to destroy the IRA, rather than negotiate a political solution,Operation Banner, Chapter II, page 15: \\"The British Government‚Äôs main military objective in the 1980s was the destruction of PIRA, rather than resolving the conflict.\\" and that the British campaign produced no final victory \\"in any recognisable way\\".Operation Banner, Chapter VIII, p. 15 One of the conclusions from the paper reveals the failure of the British Army to engage the IRA at strategic level and the lack of a single campaign authority and plan.Operation Banner, Chapter VIII, p. 4 = Other analyses = Some authors, including Brendan O'Brien, Patrick McCarthy, Peter Taylor, Tom Hayden, Fergus Finlay and Timothy J. White, also concluded that, unlike previous IRA campaigns, the Provisionals had not been defeated but had arrived at the conclusion of a bloody stalemate in which neither side could destroy the other.Taylor (1997), p. 381McCarthy, Patrick (2002). Language, Politics and Writing: Stolentelling in Western Europe. Palgrave Macmillan, p. 120; Hayden, Tom (2003). Irish on the Inside: In Search of the Soul of Irish America. Verso, p. 179; According to O'Brien, the IRA \\"could end its armed campaign from a avowed position of strength, discipline and military capacity. They had not been defeated.\\"O'Brien, p. 322 Political analysts Brian Barton and Patrick Roche maintain that while the IRA, although undefeated, fell short of their goal of a united Ireland, the IRA campaign was eventually legitimised by the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. Other activities Apart from its armed campaign, the Provisional IRA was also involved in many other activities, including \\"policing\\" of nationalist communities, robberies and kidnapping for the purposes of raising funds, fund raising in other countries, involvement in community events and parades, and intelligence gathering. The Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC), a body supervising the ceasefire and activities of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland has judged the Provisional IRA to have ceased all of the above activities. The IMC issues a bi-yearly public report on the activities of all paramilitary groups operating and known of in Northern Ireland. =Paramilitary policing= Activities deemed punishable by the Provisional IRA (often described as \\"anti-social activities\\"), included collaboration with the RUC and/or British Army i.e. informing, drug dealing, criminal activity outside of the Provisional IRA, joy riding, spreading of dissent, and any other activities which might either damage the Provisional IRA or interests of the community as defined by the Provisional IRA. For the most part, the list of activities deemed punishable by the Provisional IRA coincided with those deemed punishable by the community at large. Punishments ranged in severity from verbal warnings to physical attacks, through to wounding by gunshot, progressing to forcing the suspect to flee Ireland for their lives and death. This process was often described as \\"summary justice\\" by the political establishment and media. In the majority of cases the Provisional IRA claimed that there had been a full investigation and that guilt had been established before their sentence was carried out. The process, which was widely known of in nationalist communities, worked on a sliding scale of severity ‚Äì in the case of a petty thief a warning to stop may initially be issued, escalating to a physical attack known as a \\"punishment beating\\" usually with baseball bats or similar tools. If the behaviour continued then a more serious physical assault known as a \\"knee-capping\\" (gunshot wounds to limbs, hands, joints) would occur. The final level would be a threat of death against the suspect if they did not leave the island of Ireland, and if this order was not adhered to, death. The IMC has noted that the Provisional IRA has repeatedly come under pressure from nationalist community members since its cessation of violence to resume such policing but has resisted such requests. Suspected informers and those who cooperated with the RUC and British Army (sometimes referred to as collaborators) were generally dealt with by a counter-intelligence unit titled the Internal Security Unit (ISU), sometimes referred to as the \\"nutting squad\\". Typically, the ISU would abduct and interrogate suspects frequently using torture to extract confessions. The interrogations would often be recorded and played back to senior Provisional IRA members at a secretly held board of inquiry. This board would then pronounce judgement, usually a fatal gunshot to the head. A judgement as severe as death was frequently made public in the form of a communique released to the media but in some cases, for reasons of political expediency, the Provisional IRA did not announce responsibility. The bodies of killed informers were usually found shot dead by roadsides in isolated areas. On occasion recordings of their confessions were released to the media. This style of summary justice, often meted out based on evidence of dubious quality, by untrained investigators and self-appointed judges frequently led to what the Provisional IRA has acknowledged as horrific mistakes. As of February 2007, the IMC has stated that the Provisional IRA has issued \\"instructions to members not to use physical force\\" and noted what it describes as \\"the leadership‚Äôs maintenance of a firm stance against the involvement of members in criminality.\\" Where criminality has been engaged in by Provisional IRA, members of the IMC note that \\"we were satisfied these individual activities were contrary to the express injunctions of the leadership\\". =Internal republican feuds= The Provisional IRA has also targeted other republican paramilitary groups and dissenting members of the Provisional IRA who refuse or disregard orders. In 1972, 1975 and 1977, the Official IRA and Provisional IRA engaged in attacks on the opposing organisation leaving several dead on either side. In 1992, The Provisional IRA attacked and eliminated the Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO), which was widely perceived as being involved in drug dealing and other criminality in West Belfast. One IPLO member was killed, several knee-capped and more ordered to disband. The last known example of this practise as of February 2007 took place in 2000 and involved the shooting dead of a Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA) member for his opposition to the Provisionals' ceasefire. =Activities in Republic of Ireland= Although the Provisional IRA's General Order No.8 forbids military action \\"against 26 County forces under any circumstances whatsoever\\",O'Brien, p. 121 members of the Garda S√≠och√°na (the Republic of Ireland's police force) have also been killed, including Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. McCabe was killed by machine-gun fire as he sat in his patrol car in Adare County Limerick during the escort of a post office delivery in 1996. Sinn F√©in has called for the release of his killers under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In total, the Provisional IRA killed six Garda√≠ and one Irish Army soldier, mostly during robberies. =Robberies and criminal enterprise= The Provisional IRA has carried out numerous bank and post office robberies across Ireland throughout its existence. An RUC estimate from 1982‚Äì83, puts the amount stolen in such raids by the Provisional IRA at around ¬£700,000 (sterling). Also in the 1980s, the Provisional IRA were involved in the kidnapping and ransom of businessmen Gaelen Weston, Ben Dunne and Don Tidey. Activities such as these were linked to the IRA's fund-raising. Garda√≠ estimate that the Provisional IRA got up to ¬£1.5 million from these activities. Activities include smuggling, sale of stolen items and contraband including cigarettes, red diesel, extortion, protection rackets, and money laundering. Most recently, the Provisional IRA have been blamed for carrying out the Northern Bank Robbery in December 2004, although no proof was ever forwarded and this crime remains unsolved. The IMC note that in their view the Provisional IRA has not had any \\"organisational involvement in robbery or other such organised crime\\". Thomas Murphy, a prominent Provisional IRA leader from South Armagh, has been the subject of repeated rumours of organised crime including diesel smuggling and tax evasion. In 2006 both Irish and British security forces mounted a major joint raid on his farm, and in December 2015 he was arrested and put on trial in Dublin's Special Criminal Court charged with tax evasion. He was found guilty of tax evasion on 17 December 2015. References =Sources= *J.

The station overlooks the Montrose Basin and is situated on the Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line, 90 miles (144 km) north of Edinburgh Waverley. History The town of Montrose had initially been served by a short branch line from the Aberdeen Railway at Dubton Junction, which ran to a modest terminus close to the centre of the town and opened in 1848.Railscot - Aberdeen Railway www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2014-02-03 The current station was opened in 1883 by the North British Railway on their North British, Arbroath and Montrose Railway route linking Arbroath with the Scottish North Eastern Railway main line through Strathmore at Kinnaber Junction. This was essentially a continuation of the NBR main line from Edinburgh via the Tay Rail Bridge and allowed the company to accelerate its services between the Scottish capital and Aberdeen by an hour. Though the line received parliamentary approval in 1871, it wasn't until 1881 that the line was opened for goods traffic, progress having been delayed by the need to rebuild the iron South Esk viaduct south of the station. The original had been built to the design of Sir Thomas Bouch, which was considered suspect after the Tay Bridge Disaster of 1879 - upon testing under heavy loads, several of the piers failed and so it had to be replaced. Passenger traffic subsequently began on the line on 1 May 1883.Railscot - North British, Arbroath & Montrose Railway Railscot; Retrieved 2014-02-03 To the north of the station a chord line was laid in by the NBR to give access to the Montrose and Bervie Railway at Broomfield Junction; this 13 mile branch had been opened in 1865 and initially worked by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (whose Montrose East station it originally shared) but taken over by the NBR in 1881 when the main NBA&MR; was opened. After a period of joint operation by both companies, the NBR worked all services from 1899 until the 1923 Grouping, when the London and North Eastern Railway took over. Passenger services were subsequently withdrawn by British Railways in 1951, though freight traffic continued until 1966. From 30 April 1934, services from the Dubton branch also operated to and from here with the closure of the former Caledonian terminus to passenger traffic. The station was host to a LMS caravan in 1936 followed by three caravans from 1937 to 1939. Passenger traffic on this route ended in August 1952, with complete closure following in 1963. The section of line across the viaduct and on to Usan is the only single track section on the entire line between Edinburgh & Aberdeen - though the rest of the route was doubled by the NBR in the years after opening, the cost of widening or rebuilding the viaduct to accommodate double track was deemed prohibitive and so it remained single. Until recently, the section was worked by signal boxes at each end (Usan and Montrose South) using tokenless block regulations, but a 2010 resignalling scheme saw both boxes closed and control transferred to the former Montrose North box - this now supervises the entire area including the single line over the viaduct. The work also made the southbound platform at the station bi-directional.Signal Boxes to closeMontrose Review news article 28-01-2010; Retrieved 2014-02-03 Services The station receives regular calls by Abellio ScotRail trains on both the and Edinburgh Waverley to routes throughout the week.

The organisation ceased to operate during World War I, but was revived in 1921.Yearbook of International Organizations (1997), vol.1A By 1935, it had affiliates in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

In 2006, the WCL merged with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and in November 2007, the IFTC merged into the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation (ITGLWF).

He was a grandson of the hero-emperor L√™ L·ª£i. During nearly all of his short reign, the real power behind the throne was his mother, Empress Dowager Tuy√™n T·ª´, a Royal Consort of Emperor L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng.  Biography  With the sudden death of L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng, his heir was an infant son named Bang Co, mothered by Royal Consort Nguyen Thi Anh. He was the third son of his father, but the elder son (Le Nghi D√¢n) had been officially passed over due to his mother's low social status. The government was actually under the control of Trinh Kha. Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ was a long-time aide, friend, and counselor of L√™ L·ª£i. By 1442, he was the first among the surviving top aides of L√™ L·ª£i, the others had been killed or were second rank. Despite the dangers of having an infant on the throne, the government seems to have run well with no serious problems. The mother of the emperor, Empress Dowager Tuy√™n T·ª´ was around 21 years old when her son was appointed the future emperor, over time she assumed more power in the government. The next 17 years were good years for Vietnam. While some disputes surfaced between the Confucian scholars and the noble families, by and large things were fairly peaceful and prosperous for the country. The king of Champa, Maha Vijaya, raided Hoa-chau in 1444 and 1445. The Court of Annam sent messages to the Zhengtong Emperor of Ming China protesting these raids. The Ming did nothing other than rebuke Champa, so in 1446 the Vietnamese sent an army under the command of Le Kha and Le Tho to enter Cham territory. The campaign was successful, with the capture of the Cham capital Vijaya. \\"Maha Vijaya was made prisoner with his wives and concubines, elephants, horses, and weapons.\\"Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., The Vietnamese were driven out a year later. However, the Cham did not mount another offensive against the Vietnamese for the next twenty years. In 1451, for reasons that are unclear, Anh ordered the execution of Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ and his eldest son. Two years later, Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ was officially pardoned along with several other close advisors to Le Loi who had been killed (like L√™ S√°t). The pardon occurred in conjunction with the official ascension to power of L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng, though he was only 12 years old at the time. It is unknown why a 12-year-old boy was formally given the power of government since ancient Vietnamese custom stated that power could only be given when a boy became a man at the age of 16. It may have been done to remove the Empress Nguyen Thi Anh from power, but if that was the reason, it failed- the young emperor's mother still controlled the government up until the 1459 coup. In 1459, L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng's older brother, L√™ Nghi D√¢n, plotted with a group of officials to kill the emperor. On October 28, the plotters with some 100 \\"shiftless men\\" entered into the palace and killed the emperor (he was just 18). The next day, facing certain execution, his mother, Empress Dowager Tuy√™n T·ª´, was killed by a loyal servant. So ended the nearly 20-year period when Vietnam was essentially ruled by a woman. Later Vietnamese historians offered two different pictures of this time, one court historian said this was a period of benevolent rule, with harmony in the court and idyllic peace in the land. Another history says the court was in chaos and that having a woman rule the state was as unnatural as \\"a hen crowing at daybreak\\". Good counselors like Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ had been removed from office and inept men had been elevated, bringing oppression and calamity to Vietnam. L√™ Nghi D√¢n would not long enjoy his rule; he was removed from power and killed in a counter-coup just 9 months later. The next emperor of Vietnam was the last son of L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng: L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng, perhaps the greatest emperor in Vietnamese history. References This history is based on the doctoral thesis of John K. Whitmore \\"The Development of the Le Government in Fifteenth Century Vietnam\\" (Cornell University, 1968). The thesis is mostly concerned with the structure and make-up of the Le government from 1427 to 1471.

Appearances of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (1928‚Äì1967) in popular culture are common throughout the world. Although during his lifetime he was a highly politicized and controversial figure, in death his stylized image has been transformed into a worldwide emblem for an array of causes, representing a complex mesh of sometimes conflicting narratives. Che Guevara's image is viewed as everything from an inspirational icon of revolution, to a retro and vintage logo. Most commonly he is represented by a facial caricature originally by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick and based on Alberto Korda's famous 1960 photograph titled Guerrillero Heroico. The evocative simulacra abbreviation of the photographic portrait allowed for easy reproduction and instant recognizability across various uses. For many around the world, Che has become a generic symbol of the underdog, the idealist, the iconoclast, or the martyr. He has become, as author Michael Casey notes in Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image, \\"the quintessential postmodern icon signifying anything to anyone and everything to everyone.\\"Brand Che: Revolutionary as Marketer's Dream by Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times, April 20, 2009 Che Guevara's likeness has undergone continual apotheosis while being weaved throughout the public consciousness in a variety of ways. From being viewed as a \\"Saintly Christ-like\\" figure by the rural poor in Bolivia where he was executed, to being viewed as an idealistic insignia for youth, longing for a vague sense of rebellion. His likeness can also be seen on millions of posters, hats, key chains, mouse pads, hoodies, beanies, flags, berets, backpacks, bandannas, belt buckles, wallets, watches, wall clocks, Zippo lighters, pocket flasks, bikinis, personal tattoos, and most commonly T-shirts. Meanwhile, his life story can be found in an array of films, documentaries, plays, and songs of tribute. Throughout television, music, books, magazines, and even corporate advertisements, Che's visage is an ever-present political and apolitical emblem that has been endlessly mutated, transformed, and morphed over the last forty years of visual popular culture. This allows Che to operate as \\"both a fashionable de-politicized logo, as well as a potent anti-establishment symbol used by a wide spectrum of human rights movements and individuals affirming their own liberation.\\"Che to Che: Sexual Politics in Chile by Carmen Oquendo-Villar, for Harvard's David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies Additionally, his face has evolved into many manifestations and represents a Rashomon effect to those who observe its use. To some it is merely a generic high street visual emblem of global marketing, while to others it represents the notion of dissent, civil disobedience, or political awareness. Conversely, to those ideologically opposed to Che Guevara's belief in World revolution, or to those that resent his veneration because of his violent actions, his propagation represents shallow ignorant kitsch, idolatry worthy of spoof makeovers, parody, or even ridicule. Despite the competing narratives, Che has become a widely disseminated counter- cultural symbol that sometimes even operates entirely independent of the man himself. Hannah Charlton of The Sunday Times made note of the varying uses by postulating that \\"T-shirt wearers might wear Che's face as an easy replacement for real activism, or as a surrogate for it.\\"\\"Che Guevara: Revolutionary & Icon\\", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 8 Genesis Street graffiti of Guevara wearing a Che t-shirt in Bergen, Norway. Walk through any major metropolis around the globe and it is likely that you will come across an image of Che Guevara, most commonly a stylized version of Korda's iconic Guerrillero Heroico. An archetype, capable of endless visual regeneration which, depending on your opinion, either helps tell the story of 20th century visual literacy or kitsch banality. According to Hannah Charlton, editor of Che Guevara: Revolutionary and Icon, \\"By the 1990s the global market saw the emergence of what Naomi Klein has called a \\"market marsala\\"‚Äîa bilingual mix of North and South, some Latin, some R&B;, all couched in global party politics.\\"\\"Che Guevara: Revolutionary & Icon\\", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 11 By embodying corporate identities that appear radically individualistic and perpetually new, the brands attempt to inoculate themselves against accusations that they are selling sameness. The next stage is to present consumption as a code, where mega brands, supposedly reflecting the \\"indie\\" values of their purchasing audience, can do so with a knowing irony that of course the buyer can remain seemingly untouched by the corporate values underpinning the transaction. A 2002 political cartoon by artist Carlos Latuff, depicting Guevara wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh in modern-day solidarity. Enter Che: the 1960s symbol of student revolution, the all- pervasive ascetic gaze used to add allure and mystique to a product, because either a sophisticated audience is savvy enough to distinguish between revolution and commerce while enjoying the irony, or oblivious of who he is or what he represents. This began the metamorphosis from Che the martyred resistance fighter beloved by many, and Che the violent Marxist revolutionary despised by others, to his dual paradoxical position in the global corporate capitalist culture. The commodification of the image has been ongoing since his death, and since the late 1990s has seen a resurgence. UCLA art historian David Kunzle, has described the phenomenon by noting \\"if you go to Havana today, you will not see Che with a gun, you will see him with a rose or a dove. He's become the Gandhi of Cuba.\\" This abiding 'renaissance' of Che's visage, is chronicled by filmmaker and Guggenheim scholar Trisha Ziff, who explores the genesis, continuing adaptation, and history of Che Guevara's famous image in the 2008 documentary \\"Chevolution\\".Tribeca Review: Chevolution by Joel Keller, April 27, 2008. In another documentary titled Personal Che (2007), filmmakers Adriana Marino and Douglas Duarte document the numerous ways that people around the world re-create Che in their own image.Official Website of Personal Che directed by Adriana Mari√±o & Douglas Duarte Hannah Charlton hypothesizes that \\"appropriating the aura of Che for brand building, has now given rise to a new resurgence of \\"Che-ness\\" that transcends branding in its global appeal. In the shifting complexities of intercultural values, in the search for universal images that can speak across borders and boundaries, today's global image of Che is the most successful.\\"\\"Che Guevara: Revolutionary & Icon\\", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 12 The Che face, more than any other icon according to Charlton, can keep accruing new application without relinquishing its essence ‚Äì a generic and positive version of anti-status quo and liberation from any oppressive force, and a general, romantic, non-specific fantasy about change and revolution.

The series began as a manga first serialized in January 2003. Kamichama Karin was serialized in the Japanese sh≈çjo manga magazine Nakayoshi and published by Kodansha. While the first manga series ended at seven bound volumes, a second titled Kamichama Karin Chu (Mini-goddess Karin 2) began serialization in the same magazine in July 2006, and as of April 2008, the series ended with seven bound volumes being released. Kamichama Karin has been licensed in the U.S. and Canada by Tokyopop. Del Rey Manga published Kamichama Karin Chu between June 24, 2008 and January 26, 2010. An anime series based on the original manga was produced by TV Tokyo, NAS, and Pony Canyon, animated by Satelight, and directed by Takashi Anno. It aired on TV Tokyo from April to September 2007. Plot Karin Hanazono is an ordinary 13-year-old girl who becomes depressed after the death of her parents and her last companion, her pet cat Shii-chan. With poor grades, a mean aunt, and few friends who understand her, she feels lonely and desperately believes that God will help her out of these circumstances one day, holding on to the last remaining memento: a ring that originally belonged to her mother. Things change for better for Karin when she meets Himeka Kujyou and her cousin Kazune, whom she lives with. A confrontation after Kazune insults Karin's cat and ultimately her feelings invoke something within her and the ring, causing everything to go smoothly for Karin, including weather matters. It turns out that her precious ring is in fact a holder of the power of God, and Karin, as its bearer, is a goddess. With this revelation, she is hunted down by mysterious enemies who are seeking that power while trying to control her strength. On her journey, she discovers more about her past, and the truth of her goddess heritage, as well as how it affects others around her like Kazune and Himeka. The adventure continues in Kamichama Karin Chu with the main cast now in the eighth grade. Kazune returns from his trip to England, so Karin and the gang are back together again. Karin and the gang travel through time, along with a new comrade, a celebrity named Jin Kuga. Characters ; : :Karin is the main protagonist. She used to live with her aunt because her parents died a long time ago, but she moved in with Kazune and Himeka after they found out she can transform into a god. She is an outgoing person and sticks up for her friends, even though she does bad in school. She had a cat named that died in the beginning of the first series. She is in 7th grade and is 13-years-old. The ring Karin originally thought was her mother's ring allows her to borrow godly power. Her ring is silver and has the power of the goddess Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and war (in the \\"Chu\\" sequel her new ring has the power of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love). It is later revealed in the later volumes of the manga that Karin is actually Kazune Kujyou's wife, Suzuka Kujyou (Suzuka is Karin backwards, since suzu is another way to read the character rin). Karin Hanazono is Suzuka Kujyou from the past and was turned back into a baby by professor Kujyou to protect her. She is also the mother of Himeka and Suzune. It is shown that whenever Kazune becomes drunk (even with so much as the smell of alcohol), he acts perverted towards Karin. They end up together and will end up loving each other (without either of them knowing at first in the beginning of the anime). At the end of Kamichama Karin Chu, it is shown that she and Kazune get married. ; : :Kazune's ring has the power of Apollo, Greek god of the sun (in the Chu sequel, he has a different ring with the power of Uranus, the Greek god of the sky). He is in 7th grade. While he acts cool during much of the story, Himeka states that in the past, he was weak and cried frequently, only becoming his present self when he turned ten years old, after knowing who he was. While Himeka loves bugs, Kazune hates and fears them; in Kamichama Karin, Himeka reveals that Kazune's fear of bugs developed when he and Himeka ran into a giant bug when he was little (which, ironically, was Karin in a bug suit). Even though he is a clone of professor Kazuto Kujyou, he is incomplete and passes out after transforming in god form. He often speaks to Karin in a way that she deems sexist, talking about things like the inherent stupidity or weakness of girls (this is used against him in Chu when Jin calls him a 'girly boy'). He himself is the clone of his \\"father\\". The older Kazune, Kazuto, put his research in Himeka, and then split them in half to protect his work from his former partner, Kirihiko Karasuma. Because Karin is Suzuka, he is \\"married\\" to Karin and they get married for real at the end of Chu. He is also the father of Himeka and Suzune. :In Chu, his and Karin's son, Suzune comes from the future. He warns them that Kazune goes missing in the future (with a woman Suzune claims), and later it is discovered that he actually died soon after Suzune was born. When he learns of this, he stays away from Karin, believing what he did was horrible and had caused the future Karin too much trouble. Karin punches him after discovering this was the reason why he avoided her, saying she knew he disappeared in the future but was working hard to change that. ; : :Himeka is Karin's friend and Kazune's \\"cousin\\". She is the daughter of Kazuto and Suzuka. However, it turns out that she is somewhat Karin and Kazune's daughter, due to that Karin is Suzuka and Kazune is Kazuto's clone. Because of this, she is also Suzune's \\"older sister\\". Originally she contained Kazuto's god research data, she was then split into two by Kirihiko attempting to steal the research data. One half lives with Kazune, while the other lives with the Karasumas. When one Himeka becomes stronger, the other becomes weaker. Since she was a young girl, she has always defended Kazune, who was a bit of a crybaby when they were little. She loves bugs and is a good cook. She is in 7th grade. Like Karin, she does poorly in school. She tells Karin at one point that while she has a strong affection for Kazune, it is not necessarily a romantic attachment, as Kazune is \\"kind of like a brother and kind of like a dad\\" to Himeka (referencing Kazune's identity as a clone of Himeka's father).She also witnessed Kazune and Karin kissing in the anime. Later in the series, Kazune says that Himeka is his daughter (along with Karin in Kamichama Karin 7), which surprised her. ; : : President of Sakuragaoka Academy. He tests the protagonists and fights them outside the campus. Karin refers to him as \\"Mr. Glasses Man\\" (meganekko), \\"Four eyes-san\\" or \\"Glasses Guy\\". His only true relative is his twin sister Kirika, but he does have another \\"sister\\" by the name of . In the anime, he is a running gag character; often leaving before ever winning and revealing his plot to Karin and the others while they didn't know, thinking they did. His ring has the powers of the god Ares. Later in the series, his ring is destroyed by Kazune. He then gets possessed by his father, Kirihiko, via Zeus ring he wore after his broke, but in the end Karin and Kazune saved him. He then returns in Chu. Now, with the other Himeka, he is trying to create a new Zeus ring using the 'seed of chaos', in order to save the future Kirika who is sick. To do that, he has to revive his father, whom currently resides within Jin Kuga. ; : :Kirika is Kirio's fraternal twin sister, but for most of the series poses as a young man and Kirio's twin brother. With slightly masculine features to go along with her natural feminine beauty, as well as a kind personality, Kirika came across to many as a princely figure, which caused Karin to instantly develop a crush on her. At first, she does not believe that Karin is a goddess, but comes to believe in it. Kirika is unwillingly forced to fight Karin because of the other Himeka and her brother Kirio. Later on the manga in Volumes 4 and 5, it is revealed to the protagonists that she is actually female. Kirika explains that after the deaths of their parents, Kirio was all she had, but when he started becoming interested in the God rings, she felt as if he were slipping away from her. She at some point chopped off her hair and started pretending she was male in an attempt to in a way emotionally follow Kirio in his footsteps and prevent him from straying too far away. When Karin reveals to Kirika that she had had a crush on her, Kirika replies that in her own, strange way, she had a crush on Karin too, stating that she admired Karin for being able to be powerful without having to hide her gender. She gives help to Karin and Kazune when her father revives through her brother, Kirio. In Goddess form, she is Nyx. ; : :Michiru or Micchi is a transferred student from England and at one time lived with Karin, Kazune and Himeka. When he was little, he was involved in an accident that killed his parents and crushed his left eye beyond repair, and almost died. But Kazuto made a replaceable eye for Michiru, and saved his life. Since he was in the hospital for a year, he is a year older than Karin, Kazune, and Himeka. Michiru shares a close bond to Kazune, because he first thought of him as Kazuto, and still respects Kazune. In the manga, Michiru's friend Ami brought a notebook containing information about Himeka for Kazune to read. Michiru is a bit a pervert around Karin, and in the manga, he stole Karin's first kiss. In Chu, his transformation is the sea god Neptune/Poseidon. ; :Jin Kuga is first introduced in Kamichama Karin Chu. He is first seen as any regular \\"idol\\" that's new to the show bizz. Jin has a strong confidence in himself and wishes to regain his father's 'honor', as revealed later on in the series. Around the last volumes, it even shows that Jin is actually the father of Kirio Karasuma, who is Kirihiko Karasuma. Just like how Karin Hanazono is actually Kazune's wife, Suzuka Kujyou. Jin tends to 'glomp' and show a lot of affection for Karin which tends to make him Kazune's 'love rival' for her. Even though Jin normally has his sweet an adorable personality, he can sometimes be a pervert (Koge Donbo herself even puts it on his quick profile in the manga) around Karin. In the Chu series, Jin has the ability to transform into the god of the underworld, Hades. ; :Suzune is first introduced in Kamichama Karin Chu and appears in two episodes of the anime. He is the son of Karin and Kazune, and is Himeka's \\"younger brother\\". He came from the future, sent by the future Karin, to warn Karin and the others of the upcoming battle with the Karasumas and the tragic outcome. He is around five years old when he first appears and wears outfits with rabbit ears on his cap. He has Kazune's hair and facial appearance but has Karin's eyes and personality, and is a cute little boy. Both Karin and Kazune love him and protect him. He is the one who tells Karin of the future, including of Kazune's absence (Suzune thinks Kazune left with another woman, but he actually died soon after Suzune's birth) and gives Karin the Cronos Clock. Like all the characters, Suzune can transform, this one into Cupid. The name Suzune is combined of Suzuka (Karin's past self) and Kazune. Media =Manga= The Kamichama Karin manga series has been released into a total of seven full volumes. Koge- Donbo admits in volume one at how the point of Karin's \\"I am God\\" was to have her say something stupid and how the manga started was as a gag. Kamichama Karin was originally going to be a two chapter one-shot manga, according to Koge-Donbo. Due to its unexpected popularity, she continued the story. The story continues on in a sequel series Kamichama Karin Chu. again with seven volumes in regular special edition volumes released in Japan. The special edition volumes include the same basic content as the regular editions but include additional content making them highly valuable to manga collectors. The special editions feature different cover artwork including a gold foiled logo on a clear plastic dust jacket. Each special volume is accompanied by booklets which contain whole extra chapters to the story (usually the information in these extra chapters is supplementary, and not critical, to the main story). =Anime= An anime of Kamichama Karin debuted in Japan on April 6, 2007. Animation was done by the animation studio Satelight. The story starts off in Kamichama Karin Chu, the sequel to Kamichama Karin. Karin and Suzune are running through a park when Rika attacks Karin. Karin's Chronos Clock (which has the power to time-travel) gets the Seed of Chaos implanted into it and brings her to the first time she met Kazune at Shii-chan's grave. After that, the events follow the storyline of the manga. Kamichama Karin was shown in Japan every Saturday. An original soundtrack has been released. =Songs= ;Opening theme : by Ali Project ;Ending themes : by Mai Nakahara : by Marble ;Character Songs :\\"Hikari no Accord\\" by Mai Nakahara/Karin Hanazono :\\"Desire Show\\" by Tatsuhisa Suzuki/Jin Kuga References External links *Kamichama Karin at TV Tokyo *Kamichama Karin at Tokyopop * 2003 manga 2006 manga Japanese children's animated comedy television series Asia Television Kodansha franchises Magical girl anime and manga Romance anime and manga Satelight Sh≈çjo manga Tokyopop titles Fictional goddesses ","title":"Kamichama Karin"},{"id":"4333584","text":"Prussian provinces about 1900 Prussian districts (, literally \\"circles\\") were administrative units in the former Kingdom of Prussia, part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918, and its successor state, the Free State of Prussia, similar to a county or a shire. They were established in the course of the Stein-Hardenberg Reforms from 1815 to 1818 at an intermediate level, between the higher provinces and the government districts (Regierungsbezirke), and the lower municipal governments (Gemeinden). Then part of a modern and highly effective public administration structure, they served as a model for the present-day districts of Germany In the aftermath of World War I, the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy (Belgium) were annexed by Belgium in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority. Administration After the Napoleonic Wars and the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Prussian lands were re-arranged into ten provinces, three of them‚ÄîEast Prussia, West Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Posen‚Äîbeyond the borders of the German Confederation. The provinces were internally divided into up to six Regierungsbezirke and further into the districts on local level, headed by a Landrat administrator. The districts usually took the name of their capital (Kreisstadt), seat of the administrative office (Landratsamt). A typical district had a rough diameter of , in order to ensure that even the remotest villages could be reached by carriage within a day, though few were circular in shape. In some areas, larger districts were split into two smaller districts or were resized with neighboring ones. Larger cities usually retained their self-administration according to traditional German town law and formed exempt urban districts (Stadtkreise) comparable to independent cities. Often these cities also served as the administrative seat responsible for the smaller towns and villages incorporated into the surrounding rural districts, which then were called (Landkreise) for the purpose of differentiation (e.g. Stadtkreis and Landkreis K√∂nigsberg). The number of urban districts increased in the course of the Industrial Revolution and the following urbanization from the 1830s onwards.

It developed in the Gulf of Mexico on the same day as the September 11 attacks; after the attacks, flights were canceled nationwide for two days, and when Gabrielle struck Florida on September 14, it caused a day of additional cancellations. The storm moved ashore with winds of near Venice, a city located south of the Tampa Bay area. The combination of the winds and heavy rainfall, which peaked at in Parrish, left 570,000 customers without power along the west coast and 126,000 customers without power on the east coast. The storm caused about $230 million (2001 USD) in damage in Florida. In the Gulf of Mexico, high waves contributed to two deaths, one of which was indirect; there was also a death due to flooding in Winter Haven. After crossing the state, Gabrielle had the appearance of an occluded frontal low or subtropical cyclone; this was after the convection decreased near the center. However, Gabrielle gradually re- intensified and became a hurricane on September 17 as it passed northwest of Bermuda. The hurricane reached peak winds of , but weakened subsequently due to wind shear. Gabrielle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 19, and later that day it passed just southeast of Newfoundland. The storm produced record rainfall that caused what was described the \\"worst flooding in 100 years\\" in St. John's. Several roads and houses were flooded in the region. The extratropical remnants of Gabrielle continued to the northeast and dissipated on September 21. Meteorological history On September 5, a weak low- to mid-level trough was nearly stationary a short distance off the southeastern coastline of the United States. It remained stationary for several days, before developing a low-level circulation over Florida by September 9. The system moved into the Gulf of Mexico, and by September 11, the low and its associated convection were well-organized enough for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Depression Eight. By that time, the system was located about 170 mi (270 km) west-northwest of Key West, Florida. Located in an environment of weak steering currents, the depression drifted to the west-southwest after forming. Northerly wind shear and the presence of a nearby upper-level low initially prevented further organization, leaving the center of the depression poorly-defined with minimal convection. The depression gradually became better organized while it slowly executed a small counter-clockwise loop. Early on September 12, the system developed increased banding features over the eastern half of its circulation. By early on September 13, the upper level outflow over the depression became much more conducive for intensification, although the circulation remained broad and weak. Shortly thereafter, deep convection developed and persisted near the center, and at 1200 UTC on September 13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gabrielle while located about southwest of Venice, Florida. Under the influence of a mid-level trough, Gabrielle accelerated northeastward and quickly intensified, despite increasing amounts of westerly wind shear. Its center reformed several times under the deep convection, and on September 14 Gabrielle made landfall near Venice with winds of . At the time, Hurricane Hunters reported gusts to hurricane force, and the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility that Gabrielle made landfall as a hurricane. Land interaction and vertical wind shear quickly weakened Gabrielle over land; its convection decreased markedly with the strongest remaining convection remaining well to the northeast of the center. The storm reached the Atlantic Ocean with winds of about 18 hours after it made landfall; by that time, one forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked that the storm resembled an occluded frontal low, with a large circulation devoid of convection in a non-symmetric wind field. Another forecaster likened the storm to a subtropical cyclone, due to dry air continuing to limit organization. Tropical Storm Gabrielle over Florida on September 14 On September 15, convection gradually developed closer to the center, though operationally forecasters were unsure whether the convection was in association with Gabrielle or to a cold front to its west. A Hurricane Hunters flight into the system reported the center of Gabrielle became elongated, resembling a trough, and one forecaster considered the storm on the verge of becoming an extratropical cyclone. Shortly thereafter, convection increased near the center as the storm became stronger and better organized. Despite strong amounts of wind shear, Gabrielle intensified to attain hurricane status early on September 17 while located about 350 mi (560 km) to the west of Bermuda. Continuing northeastward, the hurricane strengthened slightly further to reach peak winds of about northwest of Bermuda. Shortly thereafter, a banding eye briefly developed in the center of the convection. Increased wind shear eventually diminished the convection, and Gabrielle weakened to tropical storm status September 18. By early on September 19, wind shear dissipated nearly all of the associated deep convection, and Gabrielle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about south of Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast, passing a short distance southeast of Newfoundland before restrengthening to reach winds of . The storm weakened, and on September 21 the extratropical remnant of Gabrielle merged with another extratropical storm over the far northern Atlantic Ocean. Preparations Shortly after Gabrielle became a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Craig Key through the Dry Tortugas in the Florida Keys and along the Florida west coast from Flamingo to the mouth of the Suwannee River. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued from Chokoloskee to Tarpon Springs. On September 14, a tropical storm warning was issued for Lake Okeechobee and the Florida east coast from Jupiter to Saint Augustine. Due to the storm, schools in six counties along the west coast were closed. All aircraft from MacDill Air Force Base were evacuated to Kansas as a precaution. Gabrielle struck Florida three days after the September 11 attacks, after which all flights nationwide were canceled for two days. Flights resumed the day Gabrielle moved ashore, with the exception of Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport which closed due to the inclement weather. In the Tampa area, two major bridges closed due to the storm. Disney World closed three water parks and several rides. The government of Bermuda issued a gale warning for the island before changing it to a tropical storm warning on September 16. The Newfoundland Weather Center issued severe weather warnings for portions of Atlantic Canada prior to the arrival of the extratropical remnant of Gabrielle. Rough sea warnings were issued for waters off of the Avalon Peninsula of eastern Newfoundland, and fishermen were recommended to remain away from the sea. Impact =United States= Daytona Beach during Gabrielle While the storm was moving east across the Gulf of Mexico, Gabrielle produced rip currents along the coast of Alabama, killing one man in Orange Beach. High surf along the Florida Panhandle destroyed a retaining wall in Pensacola Beach. In the Florida Keys, there was an indirect drowning death of a man who fell off his boat; this was due to a combination of high seas, engine failure, and intoxication. Upon making landfall, Gabrielle produced moderate winds along coastal areas of western Florida, with sustained winds of at Venice. The same station reported a wind gust of . High tides from rough waves and the storm surge reached , the highest tide since 1926. The tide flooded the northern shoreline of Charlotte Harbor and at the entrance to the Peace River, while further to the south a surge of greater than inundated the barrier island at Fort Myers Beach and flooded some cars. Beach erosion was common in the areas where the storm surge was greatest. Gabrielle Storm Total Rainfall in the United States In Lee County, tropical storm-force winds damaged many roofs, although damage was primarily due to flooding. Along the coast, high storm tides severely damaged about 100 homes and lightly damaged 500 other homes. In nearby Charlotte County, several homes were flooded along Gasparilla Island. Strong winds in Sarasota and Manatee counties downed trees and power lines, and across western Florida, 570,000 electric customers lost power. In Bradenton, high winds damaged the roof of a motel, forcing 100 people to evacuate. High rainfall in Pasco County flooded a portion of U.S. Route 301. Along the west coast of Florida, Gabrielle spawned four weak tornadoes. In Everglades City, sustained winds reached , with gusts to . While crossing the state, Gabrielle interacted with a decaying cold front, which produced intense rainfall. The highest total was in Parrish along the west coast. Jacksonville reported in a 24‚Äëhour period. In Winter Springs, a boy drowned after being swept away by a flooded stream. In Volusia, the rains flooded about 30 homes or apartments, and roads in several counties were closed. After moving across the state, the storm produced locally strong winds along the Atlantic Florida coastline, peaking at at Saint Augustine. High wind gusts left about 126,000 homes and businesses without power in eastern Florida. Rainbands spawned five tornadoes, one of which damaged six mobile homes in Cocoa. Along the coast in Brevard and Volusia, high storm tides and waves produced significant beach erosion. Overall, Gabrielle caused an estimated $230 million in damage in Florida. There were 18 tornadoes in the state, and three deaths related to the storm. Heavy rainfall extended into Georgia; a station in Brunswick reported a total of . In South Carolina, high winds and tides produced coastal flooding in Garden City. =Bermuda and Canada= In Bermuda, the combination of Gabrielle and the cold front to its west dropped about of precipitation in a four-day period. Wind gusts peaked at in an outer rainband. While extratropical, the remnants of Gabrielle passed a short distance south of Newfoundland, the second cyclone in less than a week to affect the area. The storm produced moderately strong wind gusts of over 60 mph (100 km) across the southern portion of the island, including a peak gust of 80 mph (130 km/h) at Cape Race. Seas reached 36 ft (11 m) in height. The remnant of Gabrielle dropped heavy rainfall in a short amount of time across Newfoundland, with one station at Cape Race recording in just one hour. This set the all time 6-hour precipitation record at St. John's, with a total of . In a 24‚Äëhour period, the St. John's airport recorded 4.67 in (118.6 mm), which was only 0.1 in (2.6 mm) less than the existing record. Rainfall peaked at 6.9 in (175 mm) at the Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's. In St. John's, the rainfall caused severe flooding, and the mayor of the city considered Gabrielle \\"the worst storm in 100 years\\". The flooding washed out two roads and flooded 20 others, forcing several closures. The rains flooded the basements of houses with several feet of water, affecting at least four homes. Flooding damage closed 15 schools and affected 45 businesses. There were multiple reports of sewers unable to accompany the excess of water. Hurricane-force wind gusts forced the cancellation of flights and left thousands without power, telephone, or heat. Dangerous conditions caused Canada Post to cancel delivery on the day of the storm. Hundreds of homes and buildings were damaged by the passage of Gabrielle, resulting in several million Canadian dollars in damage. Aftermath Despite the flooding in Florida, the heavy rainfall proved beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. By late September, water levels in 18 counties in southwestern Florida were within the normal range for the first time in 18 months. On September 28, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared seven Florida counties as disaster areas; this allocated federal funding for debris removal and repairing damaged public facilities. After the storm's passage, there were more than 32,000 insurance claims for homes, and 10,000 claims for damaged cars. In response to the flooding in St. John's, Newfoundland, the city mayor activated the city's Emergency Preparedness Program. On September 27, about a week after the passage of the storm, the Emergency Measures Organization began accepting applications for flood-related damage. By about a month after the storm, 169 applications were processed, with an additional 1,762 received by the Emergency Measures Organization. Eligibility for the disaster assistance included restoration to property or household items of an essential nature. A few days after the passage of the storm, the government of Newfoundland appealed to the federal government for federal disaster relief fund; the government later approved. Ultimately, disaster relief assistance totaled $6.3 million (2001 CAD), primarily to individual assistance.

Pierre Marteau (French for Peter Hammer) was the imprint of a supposed publishing house. Allegedly located in Cologne from the 17th century onward, contemporaries were well-aware that such a publishing house never actually existed. Instead, the imprint was a fiction under which publishers and printers ‚Äî in the Netherlands, France and Germany ‚Äî evaded the open identification with books they published. History =Open pseudonym and political joke, spreading in the 1660s= Probably the first Marteau-title: L'Histoire de Henry III (1660). The first French-language Marteau books appeared in the 1660s and were immediately identified as not actually being published by a man named Pierre Marteau residing in Cologne. The name would have been that of a Frenchman who had opened his shop outside France yet close to the French border. Cologne's geographical location smelled of political freedom ‚Äî Marteau would avoid France's censorship by publishing outside France; Cologne promised access to the European market and the chance to get a good deal of the production smuggled back into France where it would sell on the black market for ten times the price. French publishers, political dissidents and Huguenots who had suffered political persecution under Louis XIV had opened their shops in Amsterdam and they would soon open new shops at The Hague, Rotterdam and Geneva. The Dutch Republic (a.k.a. the United Provinces) and Switzerland protected Europe's Protestants of the reformed churches, the minority among the three European confessions. These were the privileged countries French refugees tended to go. Germany, a political entity of hundreds of little territories, half of them \\"Orthodox\\" Lutheran Protestant half of them Catholic, which all together hardly ever united under the rule of the Roman Catholic Emperor, was only a third option. Some of the more liberal places like Hamburg (Altona harboured sectarians and clandestine bookshops) and the university cities Halle, Leipzig and Jena offered freedoms to critical intellectuals, yet only a few states like Brandenburg-Prussia openly sympathised with the reformed branch of Protestantism to which France's Huguenots belonged. Germany was a choice with disadvantages. Cologne, however, was of all the options Germany granted the worst, which was to become apparent at the beginning of the 18th century when most of Germany's territories joined the Dutch Republic and Great Britain against France in the Great Alliance of the War of the Spanish Succession. The two Wittelsbach-ruled countries ‚Äî Cologne and Bavaria ‚Äî were the only important western European territories that supported Louis XIV. The first Marteau books were French and most certainly printed in Amsterdam by publishers who would not risk to tell their names even in the Netherlands. Research has hinted at Amsterdam publisher Elzevier as the man who invented the imprint. It was, at first, just one among many openly misleading imprints. Unlike the usual obvious pseudonyms like \\"Jacques le Sincere\\", the name \\"Pierre Marteau\\" sounded real. The detail which gave away his virtuality remained on the reader's side ‚Äî he would identify Cologne as the likely and yet unlikely place to go. \\"Hammer\\" made the joke a little bit more explicit: this man had courage and he was as real and as bold as a hammer. Unlike other pseudonyms which appeared on only one title page, Marteau was to have a career that could be made only by a good joke and a complete lack of intellectual property rights. Numerous publishers began to sell books under the label. Remarkably, the uncoordinated joint venture was nonetheless able to produce a distinct publisher's identity. Only certain books attracted the imprint: French yet anti-French political satire, pirated editions, sexually explicit titles. =German Marteau books and the European decades between 1689 and 1721= Historical Profile of the German Marteau production, books per year A second branch of Marteau books developed in the late 1680s when German-language titles first assumed the curious imprint. 1689 became a landmark year, the year of the Glorious Revolution which had brought a Dutch regent onto the English throne. William of Orange, who had led the Dutch resistance against France in the 1670s, became William III of England, Scotland and Wales. Whilst France protected the deposed Stuart Pretender, William was particularly keen to move both the Netherlands and his newly acquired Britain into an anti-French alliance on Germany's behalf ‚Äî Louis XIV had just attacked the Palatinate; the Nine Years' War began ‚Äî, the first phase of the Great Alliance, a period German intellectuals would soon praise as the beginning of a thoroughly European age. German intellectuals had always admired France's intellectuals and the latest Parisian fashions, yet they had also felt uneasy about their love of France. Germany's critical voices complained, as they considered their own leanings towards France, that Germany had not produced any authentic German culture. In the 1680s things changed. All of a sudden, one could be a German patriot and openly embrace French culture ‚Äî if only one stressed the fact that France's intellectuals were by now mostly critical of their own country's political repression and ambition. French dissidents published political journals, newspapers and books outside France on the international market. Germans bought and imitated them after the events of 1689 without the slightest feeling of national disloyalty. The new French authors propagated the very Europe which had come to Germany's assistance. The Great Alliance against France was produced and supported by the French press of the Netherlands. Marteau was the publisher of the Great Alliance and the new modern Europe fighting France, the hegemonic power striving for a \\"universal monarchy\\" over all its neighbours. The Marteau label became fashionable, and German publishers adopted it: it flourished, with translations of French Marteau books and with original German titles now appearing under the labels of Marteau, his Widow, his Son, and a growing line of virtual family members continuing the business. The peaks of the German Marteau production coincide with the political events Marteau covered. The beginning of the Great Alliance in 1689, its renewal on the eve of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701, its end in a Tory victory in London 1709/10 and the succeeding peace negotiations at Utrecht, kept Marteau's political authors busy. Europe turned out to be unreliable. English Tory politicians crafted the Treaty of Utrecht, which favored France's aspirations even though France had nearly lost the recent war. German intellectuals were unhappy with Europe, yet they still had to trust in Europe and to promote the European idea if Hanover's King George was to continue his aspirations to the English throne. He crossed the Channel in 1714 and had to survive a phase of political turmoil in 1715 and 1716 ‚Äî covered by Marteau with all the old anti-French political bias: France promoted the Stuart Pretender in his fight against the newly established German King. The Great Alliance gave way to the Quadruple Alliance of 1718-1720 in which Austria, France, Great Britain, and the United Provinces joined their forces to resolve the next European conflict. The fate of Europe remained on the political agenda until 1721, with the other half of Europe fighting the Great Northern War. The conflict about Sweden's and Russia's future power had begun in 1700 and involved northern and eastern Europe from Stockholm to Constantinople. It ended in 1721 and brought the European period of 1689-1721 to a silent end. Entertainment and politics: La France Galante (1696). Political books dominated Marteau's production. The peculiar Memoires pour rendre la paix perpetuelle en Europe appeared at one of Marteau's rivals in Cologne: Jacques le Pacifique published their first volume in 1712 (Immanuel Kant would refer to the outline of a union of European states at the end of the century in his famous treatise on a permanent world peace). Politics could hardly be separated from entertainment. Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer published her political gossip under the ubiquitous label. The secrets of the diplomats negotiating at Utrecht were a bestseller. Political novels like La Guerre d'Espagne (Cologne: Pierre Marteau, 1707) were extremely influential ‚Äî the book mixed fact and fiction, sections of newspaper history with personal adventures of its hero, a virtual James Bond in the services of Louis XIV. Satirical novels written by students in Halle, Leipzig and Jena claimed to be printed in Cologne. A pirated edition of the first German translation of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights appeared under the imprint. The mixing of fact and fiction, information and entertainment, intellectual theft and scandal ‚Äî the only possible answer to the censorship laws flourishing all over Europe ‚Äî marked the Marteau production between 1660 and 1721. =European publisher and German national icon= A third phase of the Marteau production began after the European decades of 1689-1721 with the nationalistic turn of the 1720s and 1730s. Marteau's German production became pro-German and potentially anti-French, finding its peaks in the years of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. The 20th and 21st centuries saw only very few new Marteau publications, with the leftist Peter Hammer Verlag in Wuppertal. The old publishing house's modern web-presence at pierre- marteau.com remains a virtual enterprise led by historians of the 18th century who use the label as a well established brand name to publish texts of the period 1650-1750 and research dealing with that period.

A monetary hegemon would need: * accessibility to international credits, * foreign exchange markets * the management of balance of payments problems in which the hegemon operates under no balance of payments constraint. * the direct (and absolute) power to enforce a unit of account in which economic calculations are made in the world economy. The term monetary hegemony appeared in Michael Hudson's Super Imperialism, describing not only an asymmetrical relationship that the US dollar has to the global economy, but the structures of this hegemonic edifice that Hudson felt supported it, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The US dollar continues to underpin the world economy and is the key currency for medium of international exchange, unit of account (e.g. pricing of oil), and unit of storage (e.g. treasury bills and bonds) and, despite arguments to the contrary, is not in a state of hegemonic decline (cf. Fields & Vernengo, 2011, 2012). The international monetary system has borne witness to two monetary hegemons: Britain and the United States. British monetary hegemony Great Britain rose to the status of monetary hegemon in 1871 with widespread adoption of the gold standard. During the gold standard of the late nineteenth century, Britain became the greatest exporter of financial capital. Its capital city, London, also became center of the world gold, money, and financial markets. This was a major reason for states adopting the gold standard. In order for Paris, Berlin, and other financial centers to attract the lucrative financial business from London, it was necessary to emulate Britain‚Äôs gold standard, for it reduced transaction costs, represented creditworthiness, and sound financial policy from government (Schwartz, 1996). The city of London was the leading supplier of both short term and long term credit, which was channeled abroad. Its extensive financial facilities provided cheap credit, which enhanced the strength of the pound through deepening its use for international payments. According to Walter (1991), during the decades of 1870-1913, ‚Äústerling bills and short-term credits financed perhaps 60 percent of world trade‚Äù (p. 88). Britain‚Äôs foreign investment cultivated foreign economies for the use of sterling. In 1850, Britain‚Äôs net overseas assets grew from 7 percent of the stock of net national wealth to 14 percent in 1870, and to around 32 percent in 1913 (Edelstein, 1994). The world had never before seen one nation committing so much of its national income and savings to foreign investment. Britain‚Äôs foreign lending practices possessed two technical aspects that gave greater credence to the prominence of sterling as a unit of storage and medium of exchange: first, British loans to foreigners were made in sterling, which allowed the borrowing country to service the debt more conveniently with its sterling reserves, and second, Britain‚Äôs use of written instructions to pay or bill exchanges were drawn in London to finance international trade. More importantly, its unrivalled ability to run current account deficits through the issuance of its unquestioned currency and its discount rate endowed Britain with a special privilege. The effects of the discount rate had a ‚Äúcontrolling influence on Britain‚Äôs balance of payments regardless of what other central banks were doing‚Äù (Cleveland, 1976, p. 17). When other central banks engaged in a tug of war over international capital flows, ‚Äúthe Bank of England could tug the hardest‚Äù (Eichengreen, 1985, p. 6). In this regard, British monetary hegemony was seldom threatened by crises of convertibility for its gold reserves were insulated by the discount rate and all foreign rates followed the British rate. The prominence of London‚Äôs credit drains led Keynes (1930) to write that the sway of London ‚Äúon credit conditions throughout the world was so predominant that the Bank of England could almost have claimed to be the conductor of the international orchestra‚Äù (p. 306-307). Karl Polanyi in his renowned work the Great Transformation states ‚ÄúPax Britannica held its sway sometimes by the ominous poise of heavy ship‚Äôs cannon, but more frequently it prevailed by the timely pull of a thread in the international monetary network‚Äù (Polanyi, 1944, p. 24). Britain‚Äôs position waned due to inter-state competition, insufficient domestic investment, and World War I. Despite its economic weaknesses, British political sway continued after World War I, which led to the gold-exchange standard created under the Genoa Conference of 1922. This system failed, however, not only due to Britain‚Äôs incapability, but to the growing decentralization of the international monetary system with the rise of New York and Paris as financial centers that resulted in the collapse of the gold exchange standard in 1931. The Gold Exchange standard of the interwar period, as Kindleberger cogently stated, collapsed because \\"Britain couldn't and America wouldn't.\\" In fact, Kindleberger provides a slightly different variation of monetary hegemony that possesses five functions rather than three defined here. American monetary hegemony The end of World War II witnessed the recentralization of monetary power in the hands of a United States that had been left largely unscathed by the war. The United States had emerged from World War II with the ideals of economic interdependence, accountability, and altruism, expressed in the vision of universal multilateralism. Above all, multilateralism simply meant nondiscrimination via the elimination or reduction of barriers and obstacles to trade, but more importantly was the maintenance of barriers ‚Äúthat were difficult to apply in a nondiscriminatory manner‚Äù (Ruggie, 1982, p. 213). In essence, the term multilateralism differs today, compared to what it meant after World War II. US interests in a multilateral, liberal world economy would not be grounded entirely in idealistic internationalism. There was the cold, calculating necessity of generating a US export surplus. This would obviate government spending, stimulate the domestic economy, substitute for domestic investment, and avert reorganization for certain industries in the economy that were overbuilt during the war effort. For these reasons the ‚Äúidea of an export surplus took on a special importance‚Äù (Block, 1977, p.35) for the US. The production of an export surplus was therefore intimately connected with establishing a world economy that was free of imperial systems, as well as bilateral payments and trading systems. The US would therefore aim to open its predecessor‚Äôs empire to American trade and to garner British compliance to create its postwar monetary system through financial leverage, namely the Anglo-American Financial Agreement of 1945. This new vision of universal multilateralism was, however, forestalled by the new economic realities of a war-torn Europe, symbolized by Britain‚Äôs financial inability to maintain sterling convertibility. Combined with this new economic reality was the political-military threat of the Soviet Union. On December 29, 1945, only two days before the expiration of Bretton Woods, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslave Molotov notified George Kennan, ‚Äúthat for the amount [offered] the U.S.S.R. would not subscribe to the articles‚Äù (James et al., 1994, p. 617). Two months later, in February 1946, Kennan sent his famous telegram to Washington, which inquired into why the Soviet Union had not ratified the Bretton Woods Agreement. The telegram would later be regarded as the beginning of US Cold War policy (James et al., 1994). The US thus altered its vision from universal multilateralism to regional multilateralism, which it would promote in Europe through the Marshall Plan, the European Recovery Program (ERP), and the European Payments Union (EPU). With the dissolution of the EPU came the prospect of a real multilateral world as the Bretton Woods monetary system came into effect in 1958. The same year marked the beginning of a permanent US balance of payments deficits. Throughout the 1960s, the Bretton Woods system had permitted the US to finance approximately 70 percent of its cumulative balance of payments deficits via dual processes of gold demonetization and liability financing. The liability financing enabled the US to undertake heavy overseas military expenditures and ‚Äúforeign commitments, and to retain substantial flexibility in domestic economic policy‚Äù (Gowa, 1983, p. 63). In 1970, the US was at the center of international instability that was a consequence of its rapid monetary growth (James, 1996). The US, however, had learned from the fate of its predecessor‚Äôs key currency (i.e. Sterling). Britain‚Äôs experience as monetary hegemon demonstrated to the US the problems faced by a reserve currency when foreign monetary authorities, individuals, and investors chose to convert their reserves. In terms of monetary power defined by reserves, the US share of reserves had fallen from 50 percent in 1950 to 11 percent in August 1971 (Odell, 1982, p. 218). Although, the US had become considerably weak in defending convertibility, its rule-making power was second to none. Rather than being constrained by the system it created, the US moved to the conclusion that it ‚Äúwas better to attack the system than to work within it‚Äù (James, 1996, p. 203). This decision was based on the recognition of the inseparability between foreign policy and monetary policy. The termination of the Bretton Woods system signified the subordination of monetary policy to foreign policy. The closing of the gold window was a fix that was assigned to ‚Äúfree‚Ä¶foreign policy from constraints imposed by weaknesses in the financial system‚Äù (Gowa, 1983,p. 69). US Monetary Hegemony persists as does the Bretton Woods System, as Dooley, Folkerts- Landau, Garber (2003) contend in their work An Essay on The Revised Bretton Woods System. The rules of the Bretton Woods system have stayed the same but the players have changed. The Post Bretton Woods system or Bretton Woods II has given rise to a new periphery for which the development strategy is export-led growth supported by undervalued exchange rates, capital controls and official capital outflows in the form of accumulation of reserve asset claims on the center country (i.e. US). In other words, Asia has replaced Europe in financing US balance of payments deficits.

The book suggests rules that a woman should follow in order to attract and marry the man of her dreams; these rules include that a woman should be \\"easy to be with but hard to get\\". The underlying philosophy of The Rules is that women should not aggressively pursue men, but rather, should encourage the men to pursue them. A woman who follows The Rules is called a Rules Girl.  Reaction  The book generated much discussion upon its release. Some audiences considered it useful and motivational, while others felt that it was outdated, anti-men and antifeminist, or a how-to guide that teaches women to play games that toy with men. Psychology lecturer and therapist Meg-John Barker claims that the emergence of seduction communities happened \\"almost as a direct response to this hard-to-get femininity\\". Others noted that Fein was an accountant and Schneider a freelance journalist without professional qualification in the subject matter. Fein married and divorced and has recently remarried. Schneider has been married for over 21 years. The authors admitted they were not professionals in an appearance on NBC's The Today Show. They have countered the criticism regarding their credentials by citing the results of actually following The Rules, though there is no body of evidence to support this. Proponents of the methods offered in the book point to The Rules as having positive results for both men and women. They represent the point of view that men enjoy being the aggressor and are inspired to treat women better who choose behaviors which set up boundaries and slow down the courtship process. Advocates also state that a woman making herself easily available to men may increase her chances of being unconsciously or unscrupulously taken advantage of or abused. By applying a deliberate approach to relationships, Rules champions suggest, a woman has the time and space to discover and reflect upon the character and actions of a man she is dating. Feminist values, they point out, do not preclude reacting with temperance and emotional independence to an initial attraction (on the part of a woman). They also cite that discipline and consideration inform the actions which create egalitarian relationships.  Subsequent books  The book was followed by The Rules II, The Rules for Marriage, The Rules for Online Dating, and All the Rules. In The Rules II: More Rules to Live and Love By, published in 1997, Fein and Schneider proclaim, \\"If he doesn't call, he's not that interested. Period!\\" (p. 60). In 2001 the follow-up book The Rules for Marriage: Time- Tested Secrets for Making Your Marriage Work was released in the midst of Fein's legal separation from her husband to whom she had been married for sixteen years. Fein commented on her divorce by saying that she had \\"married the right man\\" for her at that stage in her life. Her argument was that after having written a best seller and raising two children, she and her husband discovered they were two different people from the young couple that fell in love. Fein married for the second time in 2008; she had followed The Rules to attract her second husband, with the exception that they dated for three years rather than two (as ‚ÄúThe Rules II‚Äù advises) before becoming engaged. # Be a \\"Creature Unlike Any Other\\" # Don't Talk to a Man First (and Don't Ask Him to Dance) # Don't Stare at Men or Talk Too Much # Don't Meet Him Halfway or Go Dutch on a Date # Don't Call Him and Rarely Return His Calls # Always End Phone Calls First # Don't Accept a Saturday Night Date after Wednesday # Fill Up Your Time before the Date # How to Act on Dates 1, 2, and 3 # How to Act on Dates 4 through Commitment Time # Always End the Date First # Stop Dating Him if He Doesn't Buy You a Romantic Gift for Your Birthday or Valentine's Day # Don't See Him More than Once or Twice a Week # No More than Casual Kissing on the First Date # Don't Rush into Sex and Other Rules for Intimacy # Don't Tell Him What to Do # Let Him Take the Lead # Don't Expect a Man to Change or Try to Change Him # Don't Open Up Too Fast # Be Honest but Mysterious # Accentuate the Positive and Other Rules for Personal Ads # Don't Live with a Man (or Leave Your Things in His Apartment) # Don't Date a Married Man # Slowly Involve Him in Your Family and Other Rules for Women with Children # Practice, Practice, Practice!

It is bounded by Saanich Inlet on the west, and various straits of the Strait of Georgia on the east, chiefly Haro Strait. The exact southern boundary of what is referred to as the \\"Saanich Peninsula\\" (or simply as \\"the Peninsula\\") is somewhat fluid in local parlance. Name Its name in the Saanich dialect, WÃ±S√ÅNEƒÜ, means \\"raised up\\" (where meaning the people, that term means \\"emerging people). Geography and climate Lying in the rain shadow of both the Vancouver Island Ranges and the Olympic Mountains, Saanich Peninsula is the driest part of Vancouver Island. The driest recording station in the provincial capital city of Victoria averages only of precipitation annually. Precipitation increases from east to west, and from south to north. The natural flora of the region include mixed forests of Douglas fir, Western red cedar, hemlock, arbutus, Garry oak, and manzanita. The ground cover includes snowberry, Oregon grape, salal, sword fern, trillium, and fawn lily. The peninsula is characterized by rolling hills and numerous freshwater ponds and lakes. Notable natural features of Saanich Peninsula include Elk Lake, Beaver Lake, Mount Newton, Bear Hill, Tod Inlet, Mount Finlayson, Maltby Lake, Prospect Lake, Durrance Lake, and Mount Work. Many of these features are protected in regional and municipal parks. Geology Many different kinds of bedrock underlie the peninsula. Sandstone is common at the northern end. Granodiorite crops out in many northern and central areas. Amphibolite, diorite, gabbro and quartz diorite are common in the south. Smaller areas of andesite, basalt, chert, dacite and limestone are also found. History The region is the historical homeland of certain Coast Salish peoples. Several Indian Reserves are located on the peninsula, predominantly along the shore of Saanich Inlet. Early European settlers arrived in the mid-nineteenth century, pursuing mainly resource-based economic activities such as logging, fishing, and ‚Äî most notably ‚Äî agriculture. The peninsula is home to the oldest agricultural exhibition in Western Canada, the Saanich Fair, sponsored by the North and South Saanich Agricultural Society. In more recent decades, residential and commercial development has become widespread on the Peninsula, although provincial law protects much of the region's farmland from rezoning. The peninsula is also home to many wilderness parks, mostly on its southwest. The largest of these is Gowlland Tod Provincial Park. Transportation The peninsula is also the location of the Swartz Bay terminal of the BC Ferry Corporation, the Victoria International Airport at Patricia Bay, aka \\"Pat Bay\\", and the western terminal of the Washington State Ferries run through the San Juan Islands from Anacortes to Sidney. Another ferry on the west coast of the peninsula connects Brentwood Bay to Mill Bay Cultural institutions Just north of Elk Lake is the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory. Butchart Gardens is located just south of the town of Brentwood Bay, which was the original home of a long-established private school of the same name. Governance The following municipalities are located on the peninsula. They are part of Greater Victoria and member municipalities of the Capital Regional District/(CRD): * Central Saanich (containing the villages of Brentwood Bay and Saanichton) * Highlands (the southwestern part) * North Saanich * Saanich (its northern portions) * Sidney The Tsawout First Nation reserve and band office is located in Saanichton overlooking James Island on the east shore of the Peninsula; the Tsartlip First Nation is based on the west side of the peninsula north of Brentwood Bay; the Pauquachin First Nation is based between Mount Newton and Coles Bay on west side of the Peninsula; and the Tseycum First Nation is based on the NW of the Peninsula along the shores of Patricia Bay.

Its primary job was to provide cities and towns across the northern side of Greater Indianapolis with heavy commerce, but also served as a northern route between SR 37 and SR 267, however with the advent of modern interstates, then its designation was removed in the 1970s. Middle section of SR 234 started at SR 37 in Noblesville Indiana. It ran west along 146th Street, so as to utilize that bridge over White River, then turned south on River Road until it reached 116th Street. At that point, it turned west again and proceeded through Carmel, then Zionsville, and ended on SR 267. Because of its proximity to many places, then it supplied heavy commerce to areas such as; Noblesville, Fishers, Carmel, Homeplace, Zionsville, Whitestown and Fayette. Many locals still use the old route to avoid the traffic of heavy commerce.

It starred Dick Miller and was set in beatnik culture. The film, produced on a $50,000 budget, was shot in five days and shares many of the low-budget filmmaking aesthetics commonly associated with Corman's work. Written by Charles B. Griffith, the film is a dark comic satire about a dimwitted, impressionable young busboy at a Bohemian caf√© who is acclaimed as a brilliant sculptor when he accidentally kills his landlady's cat and covers its body in clay to hide the evidence. When he is pressured to create similar work, he becomes murderous.Gary A. Smith, The American International Pictures Video Guide, McFarland 2009 p 35 A Bucket of Blood was the first of three collaborations between Corman and Griffith in the comedy genre, followed by The Little Shop of Horrors (which was shot on the same sets as A Bucket of Blood) and Creature from the Haunted Sea. Corman had made no previous attempt at the genre, although past and future Corman productions in other genres incorporated comedic elements. The film is a satire not only of Corman's own films but also of the art world and teen films of the 1950s. The film is noted as well in many circles as an honest, undiscriminating portrayal of the many facets of beatnik culture, including art, dance and style of living. The plot has similarities to Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933). However, by setting the story in the Beat milieu of 1950s Southern California, Corman creates an entirely different mood from the earlier film.Wright, Gene (1986). Horrorshow. New York: Facts on File Publications. . p. 4. Plot summary One night after hearing the words of Maxwell H. Brock (Julian Burton), a poet who performs at The Yellow Door cafe, the dimwitted, impressionable, busboy Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) returns home to attempt to create a sculpture of the face of the hostess Carla (Barboura Morris). He stops when he hears the meowing of Frankie, the cat owned by his inquisitive landlady, Mrs. Surchart (Myrtle Vail), who has somehow gotten himself stuck in Walter's wall. Walter attempts to get Frankie out using a knife, but accidentally kills the cat when he sticks the knife into his wall. Instead of giving Frankie a proper burial, Walter covers the cat in clay, leaving the knife stuck in it. Carla and Leonard admire Walter's \\"sculpture\\", Dead Cat. The next morning, Walter shows the cat to Carla and his boss Leonard (Antony Carbone). Leonard dismisses the oddly morbid piece, but Carla is enthusiastic about the work and convinces Leonard to display it in the caf√©. Walter receives praise from Will (John Brinkley) and the other beatniks in the caf√©. An adoring fan, Naolia (Jhean Burton), gives him a vial of heroin to remember her by. Naively ignorant of its function, he takes it home and is followed by Lou Raby (Bert Convy), an undercover cop, who attempts to take him into custody for narcotics possession. In a blind panic, thinking Lou is about to shoot him, Walter hits him with the frying pan he is holding, killing Lou instantly. Meanwhile, Walter's boss discovers the secret behind Walter's \\"Dead Cat\\" piece when he sees fur sticking out of it. The next morning, Walter tells the caf√©-goers that he has a new piece, which he calls \\"Murdered Man\\". Both Leonard and Carla come with Walter as he unveils his latest work and are simultaneously amazed and appalled. Carla critiques it as \\"hideous and eloquent\\" and deserving of a public exhibition. Leonard is aghast at the idea, but realizes the potential for wealth if he plays his cards right. The next night, Walter is treated like a king by almost everyone, except for a blonde model named Alice (Judy Bamber), who is widely disliked by her peers. Walter later follows her home and confronts her, explaining that he wants to pay her to model. At Walter's apartment, Alice strips nude and poses in a chair, where Walter proceeds to strangle her with her scarf. Walter creates a statue of Alice which, once unveiled, so impresses Brock that he throws a party at the Yellow Door in Walter's honor. Costumed as a carnival fool, Walter is wined and dined to excess. After the party, Walter later stumbles towards his apartment. Still drunk, he beheads a factory worker with his own buzzsaw to create a bust. When he shows the head to Leonard, the boss realizes that he must stop Walter's murderous rampage and promises Walter a show to offload his latest \\"sculptures\\". At the exhibit, Walter proposes to Carla, but she rejects him. Walter is distraught and now offers to sculpt her, and she happily agrees to after the reception. Back at the exhibit, however, she finds part of the clay on one figure has worn away, revealing Alice's finger. When she tells Walter that there is a body in one of the sculptures, he tells her that he \\"made them immortal\\", and that he can make her immortal, too. She flees, he chases, and the others at the exhibit learn Walter's secret and join the chase. Walter and Carla wind up at a lumber yard where Walter, haunted by the voices of Lou and Alice, stops chasing Carla, and runs home. With discovery and retribution closing in on him, Walter vows to \\"hide where they'll never find me\\". The police, Carla, Leonard, Maxwell, and the others break down Walter's apartment door only to find that Walter has hanged himself. Looking askance at the hanging, clay-daubed corpse, Maxwell proclaims, \\"I suppose he would have called it \\"Hanging Man\\" ... his greatest work.\\" Cast Production =Development= In the middle of 1959, American International Pictures approached Roger Corman to direct a horror film‚Äîbut only gave Corman a $50,000 budget and a five-day shooting schedule‚Äîplus leftover sets from Diary of a High School Bride (1959).Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 p145 Corman accepted the challenge but later said he was uninterested in producing a straightforward horror film. He claims he and screenwriter Charles B. Griffith developed the idea for producing a satirical black comedy horror film about the beatnik culture. Charles Griffith later claimed Corman was very uneasy at the idea of making a comedy \\"because you have to be good. We don't have the time or money to be good, so we stick to action.\\"Beverly Gray, Roger Corman: Blood Sucking Vampires, Flesh Eating Cockroaches and Driller Killers AZ Ferris Publications 2014 p 48 Griffith says he talked Corman around by pointing out that since the film was made for such a little amount of money over such a short schedule, he could not fail to make money. Corman says that the genesis of the film was an evening he and Griffith \\"spent drifting around the beatnik coffeehouses, observing the scene and tossing ideas and reactions back and forth until we had the basic story.\\"Roger Corman, \\"Wild Imagination: Charles B. Griffith 1930‚Äì2007\\", LA Weekly 17 October 2007 accessed 20 April 2014 The director says by the end of the evening they developed the film's plot structure, partially basing the story upon Mystery of the Wax Museum. Griffith says Corman was uneasy about how to direct comedy, and Griffith, whose parents were in vaudeville, advised him that the key was to ensure the actors played everything straight. =Shooting= The film was shot under the title The Living Dead, and filming started 11 May 1959. According to actor Antony Carbone, \\"[The production] had a kind of spirit of 'having fun,' and I think [Corman] realized that while making the film. And I feel it helped him in other films he made, like The Little Shop of Horrors‚àíhe carried that Bucket of Blood 'idea' into that next film.\\" Actor Dick Miller was unhappy with the film's low production values. Miller is quoted by Beverly Gray as stating that, > If they'd had more money to put into the production so we didn't have to use > mannequins for the statues; if we didn't have to shoot the last scene with > me hanging with just some gray make-up on because they didn't have time to > put the plaster on me, this could have been a very classic little film. The > story was good; the acting was good; the humor in it was good; the timing > was right; everything about it was right. But they didn't have any money for > production values ... and it suffered. Release American International Pictures' theatrical marketing campaign emphasized the comedic aspects of the film's plot, proclaiming that the audience would be \\"sick, sick, sick‚Äîfrom laughing!\\", a reference to cartoonist Jules Feiffer's popular Village Voice comic strip and his 1958 book with the same title. The film's poster consists of a series of comic strip panels humorously hinting at the film's horror content. According to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of \\"cheap teen movies\\" released for the drive-in market. They consisted of \\"exploitative, cheap fare created especially for them [teens] in a newly established teen/drive-in genre.\\" When Corman found that the film \\"worked well\\", he continued to direct two more comedic films scripted by Griffith: The Little Shop of Horrors, a farce with a similar plot to Bucket of Blood and using the same sets; and Creature from the Haunted Sea, a parody of the monster movie genre. The film was acquired by MGM Home Entertainment upon the company's purchase of Orion Pictures, which had owned the AIP catalog. MGM released A Bucket of Blood on VHS and DVD in 2000. MGM re-released the film as part of a box set with seven other Corman productions in 2007. However, the box set featured the same menus and transfer as MGM's previous edition of the film. Reception From a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that although \\"the horror ultimately becomes rather too explicit, this macabre satire on beatniks and teenage horror films has some particularly adroit dialogue and tragi-comic situations.\\" The review praised Dick Miller, who \\"gives a performance of sustained poignancy as the half-wit hero.\\" In a retrospective review, Sight & Sound referred to the film as \\"Corman's best work\\" with \\"hilarious dialogue and a finale reminiscent of Fritz Lang's M\\" and that his \\"low-budget comedy horror pic works both as satire at the expense of the Beat generation and as a trenchant little allegory about the New York art world in general.\\" Corman later said the film \\"wasn't a huge success, but I think we were ahead of our time because The Raven, which is a triumph, is far less funny. Maybe the film was too modest, filmed in five days on sets that came from a film about youth. The distributors didn't know what to make of a movie that didn't belong to any particular genre. They were always scared of comedy.\\" Adaptations The film was remade in 1995 under the same name, although the remake was also distributed under the title The Death Artist. The remake was directed by comedian Michael McDonald and starred Anthony Michael Hall and Justine Bateman. The cast also included cameos by David Cross, Paul Bartel, Mink Stole, Jennifer Coolidge and Will Ferrell. A musical production of A Bucket of Blood was produced by Chicago's Annoyance Theatre in 2009. It opened Sept. 26, and closed Oct. 31, 2009, garnering exceptional reviews, including a recommendation from the Chicago Reader. The musical was directed by Ray Mees, with music by Chuck Malone. The cast included James Stanton as Walter Paisley, Sam Locke as Leonard, Peter Robards as Maxwell, Jen Spyra as Carla, Colleen Breen as Naolia, Maari Suorsa as Alice, Tyler Patocka as William and Peter Kremidas as Lee.Another musical adaptation is currently in development, retitled Beatsville.

Born in a Dagara community in Dano, Burkina Faso, he was raised by Jesuits from the age of four. He currently lives on the West Coast of the United States. Background At age four, Som√© was abducted from his people, the Dagara by a missionary, and taken to a boarding school where he was inflicted with a Western education. Som√© endured sixteen years of physical and emotional abuse by the priests, but he left the school when he was twenty to return to the village of his birth. Upon his return, integration into his traditional tribal religion and customs was difficult, due to his long absence from his culture and his apparent indoctrination into Christianity and a \\"white man's world\\". Elders from the village believed that Som√©'s ancestral spirit had withdrawn from his body and that he had already undergone a type of rite of passage into manhood in the white world. Despite this, they agreed to let him undergo a belated manhood rite with a younger group in the tribe. Having been raised outside of the culture and not speaking the language made the month-long, baor process, believed to unite soul and body, more dangerous for him than for the culturally-Dagara youths also undergoing the rite.

For the article on the lunar crater named for him, see Cleostratus (crater). Cleostratus (; b. c. 520 BC; d. possibly 432 BC) was an astronomer of ancient Greece. He was a native of Tenedos.Pseudo Scylax, Periplus, ¬ß95 He is believed by ancient historians to have introduced the zodiac (beginning with Aries and Sagittarius) and the solar calendar. According to J. Webb, Cleostratus took his ideas from the Babylonians.E. J. Webb, Cleostratus Redivivus, The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 41, Part 1 (1921), pp. 70-85 There is little primary material to credit any person with the creation or design of the Zodiac. Historical research into this has shown translation issues and coincidences including the Tenedos connection with the Philosopher Thales.Fotheringham J.K. ‚ÄúCleostratus.‚Äù The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 39, (1919), pp. 164-184. Historical writings also refer to Cleostratus as a means of establishing a tradition of authority of Greek accomplishments.Fotheringham J.K. ‚ÄúCleostratus (III)‚Äù The Journal of Hellenic Studies , Vol. 45, Part 1 (1925), pp. 78-83. Continuation of Babylonian cycles is considered not to be scientific progress as the Greeks improved the accuracy of their cycles, only exercises in the art of combining days, months, and years, of which the relative mean durations had been learned from Babylon.Webb E.J. ‚ÄúCleostratus and His Work‚Äù.The Journal of Hellenic Studies , Vol. 48, Part 1 (1928), pp. 54-63 The Greeks may have established a similar system, as other cultures had too, independently of the Babylonians. However, most agree that there can never be a definite answer for the argument concerning who established the first known system in the west. Pliny the Elder writes in his Natural History: \\"The obliquitie and crookednesse thereof, Anaximander the Milesian is reported to have observed first; and thereby opened the gate and passage to Astronomie, and the knowledge of all things: and this happened in the 58 Olympias. Afterwards Cleostratus marked the signes therein, and namely those first of Aries and Sagitarius. As for the Sphere it selfe, Atlas devised long before.\\" Pliny also was writing in a way similar to his contemporaries in that a sound argument had to be based on past knowledge or the accomplishments of past thinkers. Censorinus (De Die Natali, c. 18) considers Cleostratus to have been the inventor of the octaeteris, or cycle of eight years. Cleostratus' name is associated with an eight-year intercalation cycle, to keep Greek civil calendars (lunar in nature) in line with the solar year, a cycle which was improved by Harpalus.Pfundstein, James M. \\"....: Aeschylus, Astronomy and The Agamemnon.\\" Classical Journal 98, no. 4 (April 2003): 397-410. The octaeteris was used before the Metonic cycle of 19 years, and was popularly attributed to Eudoxus. Theophrastus (de Sign. Pluv., p. 239, ed. Basil. 1541) mentions him as a meteorological observer along with of Methymna and Phaeinus of Athens. Gaius Julius Hyginus (Poetica Astronomica, ii. 13) says that Cleostratus first pointed out the two stars in Auriga called Haedi.

It is a Grade I listed building. History A monk named Guthlac came to what was then an island in the Fens to live the life of a hermit, and he dwelt at Croyland between 699 and 714. Following in Guthlac‚Äôs footsteps, a monastic community came into being here in the 8th century. Croyland Abbey was dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin, Saint Bartholomew and Saint Guthlac. During the third quarter of the 10th century, Crowland came into the possession of the nobleman Turketul, a relative of Osketel, Archbishop of York. Turketul, a cleric, became abbot there and endowed the abbey with many estates. It is thought that, about this time, Crowland adopted the Benedictine rule. In the 11th century, Hereward the Wake was a tenant of the abbey. In 1537, the abbot of Croyland wrote to Thomas Cromwell, sending him a gift of fish: \\"ryght mekely besychinge yowr Lordshippe favourably to accept the same fyshe, and to be gude and favourable Lord unto me and my poore House.\\" Despite these representations, the abbey was dissolved in 1539. The monastic buildings, including the chancel, transepts and crossing of the church appear to have been demolished fairly promptly but the nave and aisles had been used as the parish church and continued in that role. During the English Civil War the remains of the abbey were fortified and garrisoned by Royalists in 1642 under governor Thomas Stiles. After a short siege it was taken by Parliamentarian forces under the command of Oliver Cromwell in May 1643. and this appears to have been when serious damage was done to the abbey's structure. The nave roof fell in 1720, the main south wall was taken down in 1744. The north aisle of the nave was refurbished and remains in use as the parish church. Crowland is well known to historians as the probable home of the Croyland Chronicle of Pseudo-Ingulf, begun by one of its monks and continued by several other hands. The church contains a skull which is identified as the skull of the 9th century Abbot Theodore, who was killed at the altar by Vikings. The relic used to be on public view until it was stolen from its display case in 1982. The skull was returned anonymously in 1999. John Clare wrote a sonnet entitled 'Crowland Abbey', which was first published in The Literary Souvenir for 1828 and reprinted in his last book, The Rural Muse in 1835. List of abbots of Crowland Organ The abbey has a small two manual pipe organ. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. Bells Crowland Abbey is claimed to have been the first church in England ‚Äì and among the first in the world ‚Äì to have a tuned peal or ring of bells (circa 986). According to the Croyland Chronicle, the Abbot Egelric, who died in 984, supplied the peal of bells: \\"He also had two large bells made, which he called Bartholomew and Bettelm; also two of middle size, which he called Turketul and Tatwin; and two small ones, to which he gave the names of Pega and Bega. The Lord abbat Turketul had previously had one very large bell made called Guthlac, and when it was rung with the bells before-named, an exquisite harmony was produced thereby; nor was there such a peal of bells in those days in all England.\\" Ingulf's Chronicle of the Abbey of Croyland, translated from the Latin by Henry T. Riley. London, 1854. However, the histories attributed to the 11th-century Abbot Ingulf are now thought to be 14th-century inventions of Pseudo-Ingulf, thus casting doubt on the charming story of the origin of the bells. Less controversially, the chimes of the present bells were the first to be broadcast on wireless radio by the BBC on 1 November 1925.\\"Crowland Abbey bells to feature on BBC Radio 4 'Feedback' programme\\" Lincoln Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers At 90 feet, the 'pull' or ropes are the longest in England.

He is usually called Willermus instead of Wilelmus in Latin annals and so is often called Guillerm instead of Guillaume in French. He left Normandy around 1053 with his elder half-brother Geoffrey and full brother Mauger. He participated in the Battle of Civitate in the years of his arrival and was received cordially by his half-brother Humphrey, the reigning count of Apulia. In 1055, he distinguished himself in the taking of the castle of San Nicandro, which formed the nucleus of his county of the Principato, with which he was invested by Humphrey in 1056. In 1058, he married Maria, the daughter of Guy, Duke of Sorrento and brother of Guaimar IV of Salerno. He inherited all Guy's lands in the principality of Salerno and fought with Guaimar's successor, Gisulf II, whose lands he ate away at until little was left but Salerno itself. He also inherited the Capitanate from Mauger, who died between 1054 and 1060. That last possession he gave to Geoffrey, out of fraternal love, Malaterra informs us. He invited his landless youngest brother Roger to join him, promising him half of all he owned, save his wife and children. He aided Roger against their elder brother Robert Guiscard, who had succeeded Humphrey, and gave him the castle of Scalea, at Catanzaro. He fought against Robert later when Robert came to the aid of Gisulf in order to receive in marriage Gisulf's sister Sichelgaita. In 1067, the Council of Melfi excommunicated him, along with Turgis de Rota and Guimond de Moulins, for stealing property from the church of Alfano I, Archbishop of Salerno. Later that year, he travelled to Salerno to reconcile with Pope Alexander II.

The first Thai sound film was Long Thang (Gone Astray), produced by the Wasuwat brothers, and premiered on 1 April 1932.

The stars were Chamras Suwakhon and Manee Sumonnat, the first Thai actors to be recognized as movie stars by having their names painted on their chairs while filming at the studio.Natee, Kritya (translator) and Himes, Robert (editor). January 1, 2004. \\"Manee Sumonnaj (The Shining Star)\\" , Thai Film Foundation. As the Second World War loomed, and the country being led by a dictatorship under Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram film companies were pressed into service to make propaganda films to whip up nationalism. Opposition politics found their way into film, too, with statesman Pridi Phanomyong producing King of the White Elephant, in 1940. With all the dialogue in English, Pridi hoped to send a message to the outside world that he was unhappy with the militaristic direction his country was taking. The film depicts the story of an ancient Siamese king who only goes to war after he's been attacked. =Film dubbing= The advent of sound raised another problem for cinemas in Thailand: the language of the talkies. Soon a dubbing method developed in which a dubber would provide a simultaneous translation of the dialogue by speaking Thai into a microphone at the back of the theater. The first Thai dubber was Sin Sibunruang, or \\"Tit Khiaw\\", who had worked for Siam Film Company and was the editor of the company's film magazine. Tit Khiaw and other talented dubbers became stars in their own right. They would perform all the roles in the films, both male and female, as well as such sound effects as animal noises, cars and gunfire. Also, there were film companies that could not afford to make sound films, and would make films with the intention that they would be dubbed at screenings by live performers reading from a script. These dubbed films proved as popular as the talkies, especially if the dubber was well known. Due to the extensive use of 16 mm film in the 1970s, the technique has lasted up until recent years, especially for outdoor screenings of films at temple fairs in rural areas. Examples of a dubber at work can be seen in contemporary Thai films, Monrak Transistor (2000) and Bangkok Loco (2004). =Post-war years: The 16-mm era= After the end of the Second World War, filmmaking got under way again in Thailand using surplus 16 mm black-and-white stock from wartime newsreel production. At least two Thai films were produced in 1946. One was an action film, Chai Chatree (Brave Men), directed by journalist-turned-filmmaker Chalerm Sawetanant. The screenplay was by writer Malai Chupinij, who would go on to script other films of the era, including Chao Fah Din Salai (Till Death Do Us Part). The other film noted by the National Film Archive for 1946 was an adaptation of a Thai folktale, Chon Kawao (The Village of Chon Kawao).\\"Good old days: Thai cinema has a long history\\", Bangkok Post retrieved August 9, 2006. The post-war boom in filmmaking really took off, however, with the use of 16-mm colour-reversal film, which was easy to obtain and make films with. The vividly coloured films were popular with audiences as well, prompting dozens of new filmmakers to enter the business.Thai films in 16-mm era ,Thai film foundation Similar to the dubbing of films during the pre-war years, some of these films used dubbers to provide dialogue and sound effects as the film was running, further adding to the entertainment value of the movies. From 1947 until 1972, 16 mm was the industry standard for Thai film production. The first hit of the era was 1949's Suparb Burut Sua Thai (Thai Gentlemen Fighters), which outgrossed Hollywood films at the local box office. That success prompted more enthusiasm for filmmaking, giving rise to the second \\"golden age\\" of Thai cinema.History of Thai films part 10 ,Thainationalfilm.com =Move toward 35 mm= At the height of the 16-mm era, cinematographer and director Rattana Pestonji sought to use 35 mm film and generally improve the artistic quality of Thai films. Most of his films are regarded today as masterpieces, including Santi-Weena, which was the first Thai film to be entered into international competition, at the 1954 Asia Pacific Film Festival in Tokyo, and 1961's Black Silk, the first Thai film in competition at the Berlin International Film Festival. Though Rattana made relatively few films, he worked tirelessly to promote the industry, and died in 1970 as he was to make a speech to government officials about setting up a national film agency. =The 1970s and '80s= Thailand saw an explosion of locally produced films during the 1970s after the Thai government imposed a heavy tax on imported films in 1977, which led to a boycott of Thailand by Hollywood studios. To pick up the slack, 150 Thai films were made in 1978 alone. Many of these films were low-grade action films and were derided by critics and scholars as \\"nam nao\\" or \\"stinking water\\". But socially conscious films were being made as well, especially by Prince Chatrichalerm Yukol, a US-educated filmmaker and member of the Thai Royal Family, whose own family had been involved with filmmaking since the industry started in Thailand. Among Chatrichalerm's films during the 1970s was Khao Chue Karn (Dr. Karn), which addressed corruption in the Thai civil service and was nearly banned by the military-dominated regime of Thanom Kittikachorn. Chatrichalerm also made Hotel Angel (Thep Thida Rong Raem), about a young woman trapped into a life of prostitution. He made dozens of films along these socially conscious lines through the 1990s, working up to his lavish historical epic, The Legend of Suriyothai in 2001. Another filmmaker active during this time was Vichit Kounavudhi, who made his share of action films as well as more socially conscious works like First Wife, about the custom of men taking \\"second wives\\" or \\"mia noi\\" ‚Äì a euphemism for mistress. Vichit also made Her Name is Boonrawd (1985), about prostitution around an American military airbase during the Vietnam War. Vichit's best known works are two semi-documentary films, Mountain People (Khon Phukao), an adventure tale about a young hill-tribe couple, and Look Isan (Son of the Northeast), about a family of subsistence farmers in 1930s Isan. Also in 1985, director Euthana Mukdasanit made Pee Seua lae Dawkmai (Butterfly and Flowers), highlighting hardships along the Southern Thailand border. Not only did the film help expose urban Thais to regional poverty, the film broke new ground in its portrayal of a Buddhist-Muslim relationship. It won the Best Film award at the Hawaii International Film Festival. =The Thai New Wave= By 1981, Hollywood studios were once again sending films to Thailand. Also, television (see also Media in Thailand) was a growing part of Thai culture. This was a low period for the Thai film industry, and by the mid-1990s, studio output was averaging about 10 films per year.Robert Williamson, Thai cinema: sustainable development or imminent decline? ,Thai film foundation In the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, three directors of television commercials ‚Äì Nonzee Nimibutr, Pen-Ek Ratanaruang and Wisit Sasanatieng ‚Äì were thinking that films needed to be more artistic to attract investors and audiences. The first breakthrough was in 1997, with Nonzee's crime drama, Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters (2499 Antapan Krong Muang), which earned a record box office take of more than 75 million baht. Also in 1997, Pen-Ek's crime comedy, Fun Bar Karaoke, was selected to play at the Berlin Film Festival ‚Äì the first time in twenty years that Thai cinema had had any kind of an international presence. Nonzee's next film, the ghost story Nang Nak, was an even bigger success, earning 149.6 million baht ‚Äì the highest-grossing film at the time. Wisit, who wrote screenplays for Dang Bireley's and Nang Nak, broke out with Tears of the Black Tiger, a super-stylised western homage to the Thai action films of the 1960s and '70s. It was the first film to be included on the programme at the Cannes Film Festival. There were also the Pang Brothers from Hong Kong, who came to Thailand to make stylish movies, starting with Bangkok Dangerous and the nod to J-Horror, The Eye. =Thai independent film= With the New Wave directors achieving commercial and artistic success, a new crop of filmmakers has grown up outside the traditional and often restrictive Thai studio system to create experimental short films and features. The leader of this indie movement is Apichatpong Weerasethakul, whose 2002 feature Blissfully Yours won the Un Certain Regard Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Featuring a risqu√© sex scene involving a Burmese man and a Thai woman in the jungle, the movie received only limited screenings in Thailand and a Thai-released DVD of the film was censored. Apichatpong's next film, Tropical Malady, featuring a gay romance between an army soldier and a country guy, was a jury-prize winner at Cannes. It, too, only received limited screenings in Thailand. Other indie directors include Aditya Assarat (Wonderful Town), Anocha Suwichakornpong (Mundane History), Pimpaka Towira (One Night Husband), Thunska Pansittivorakul (Voodoo Girls), Sivaroj Kongsakul (Eternity), Wichanon Somumjarn (In April the Following Year, There Was a Fire) and Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit (36). Censorship All films, VCDs and DVDs are placed under scrutiny of a censorship board. Until 2009, films were regulated by the Film Act of 1930. The first board of censors included both men and women and was drawn from the ranks of aristocracy, the civil service and the police. Each film passed by the censors had to include a stamp on each reel, and each item of printed advertising had to contain the stamp, too. The National Police was responsible for screening films and videos until September 2005, when the government's Ministry of Culture took over the function. Every VCD and DVD sold for home viewing must bear a stamp that it has passed the Censorship Board. On some VCDs and DVDs produced in Thailand, the censors sometimes take a hard line against depictions of nudity, sex, smoking, the presence of alcohol and guns being pointed at people, images that are forbidden on broadcast television. In other instances, violent acts might pass through uncut, but sex and nudity will be edited out. Before the digital age, scissors and petroleum jelly were the tools of the trade for censors. Today the offending images are blurred out electronically. The effect of pixelization is so pervasive that the practice has been satirised in films, including 2004's action comedy, Jaew or M.A.I.D., as well as the zombie comedy, SARS Wars. Imported DVDs are generally not altered by the Thai authorities, though the Ministry of Culture's watchdogs do ban items, or at least strongly encourage retailers to not carry them. From the time the Ministry of Culture took over the censorship board until March 2006, about 40 VCD or DVD titles were banned, though a list of the banned items was not made available.Wattanasukchai, Sirinya (January 6, 2006) \\"Not in my house\\", ThaiDay. Retrieved March 17, 2006. In 2007, the independent film, Syndromes and a Century was to undergo cuts before public release in Thailand. The censors objected to depictions of a Buddhist monk playing guitar, a physician kissing his girlfriend, some doctors drinking whisky in a hospital conference room and some monks playing with a remote-control flying saucer. Director Apichatpong Weerasethakul would not make the cuts and withdrew his film from release in Thailand. It had previously screened in other countries uncut.Rithdee, Kong. Thai director cancels film's local release, Bangkok Post (retrieved April 12, 2007). After the controversy over Syndromes and a Century, the Free Thai Cinema Movement started to gain momentum in late April 2007. A petition signed by artists and scholars was submitted to the National Legislative Assembly, which was considering a new motion picture ratings system. The proposed system, passed by the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly proved controversial as well, as it would not imposes ratings structure but also keeps censorship in place.Rithdee, Kong. December 20, 2007. Thailand passes controversial film act, Variety (magazine); retrieved 2007-12-21 The 1930 Film Act was replaced in 2009 by a film-ratings system. The ratings system has six classifications ‚Äì G for general audiences, P for \\"promote\\" as educational, 13+, 15+ and 18+ suggested viewing ages and the restricted 20- rating, which requires ID checks at the cinemas. A hidden seventh tier of the system is an outright ban by the Film and Video sub- committee.Jaichalard, Pakamard. , Daily Xpress (retrieved April 24, 2013). Genres =Action= Action films are a predominant genre of Thai film. During the 1960s and '70s, when Mitr Chaibancha and Sombat Metanee were the leading action heroes, hundreds of hard-hitting, explosive features were made. In recent years, the martial arts films starring Tony Jaa, Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior and Tom-Yum-Goong, have put Thai action films on the international map. Kerd ma lui (Born to Fight) is in the same vein, and gives more exposure to action choreographer Panna Rittikrai, who toiled for decades making low- budget, direct-to-video action films featuring dangerous stunt choreography. The culture of Thailand's B-movie stuntmen is further examined in the 2005 documentary, Crying Tigers, by Santi Taepanich. Action comedies have also proven to be popular, including 2001's Killer Tattoo by Yuthlert Sippapak, who cast well-known Thai comedians, including Petchtai Wongkamlao and Suthep Po- ngam, in roles as bumbling hitmen. =Animation= Thai animation got underway after the Second World War, when artist Sanae Klaikluen was asked by the Thai government to make a short animated cartoon that instructed Thai citizens to wear hats and farmers to wear boots. Sanae in turn influenced Payut Ngaokrachang, who made a 1955 short about a traffic cop called Haed Mahasajan. Payut went on to make Thailand's first and only cel-animated feature film, The Adventure of Sudsakorn, in 1979. Because of the labour-intensive work involved with animation, it was cheaper for studios to make live-action films, so animation was eschewed. But in recent years, Thailand's technology community has sought to make the country a hub for computer animation, with many animated television shows, commercials and video games being created in Thailand. In 2006, Thailand's first computer-animated feature film was released, Khan Khluay, about King Naresuan the Great's war elephant. It is directed by Kompin Kemgunerd, on such Disney features as Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Tarzan and Blue Sky Studios' Ice Age. Although the work is being done on computers, Kompin has faced many of the same difficulties in funding and human resources that Payut faced. =Comedies= No matter what the genre of Thai film, most films - be they action, horror or romantic dramas - have some element of comedy. One of the classic comedies from the 1960s is called Ngern Ngern Ngern (Money, Money, Money). It starred Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat in a story about the nephew of an unscrupulous moneylender who takes sides with a group of debtors against his uncle. The remake of the film was done in the 1980s. In 2005, the comedy Luang phii theng (The Holy Man) starring comedian Pongsak Pongsuwan as a street hood who poses as a Buddhist monk, was one of the top films at the domestic box office. =Crime= Most of the films by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang have been crime films, from his debut feature 1997's Fun Bar Karaoke to 2006's Invisible Waves. A true-crime film, 2003's Macabre Case of Prom Pirom (Keunbab prompiram) by veteran director Manop Udomdej, about a 1977 murder-rape of a young woman in a rural village was controversial because the village where the case took place did not want the incident revisited. The film played at many overseas festivals, including the New York Asian Film Festival. Another true-crime case about a cannibalistic serial killer in 1946 Bangkok was depicted in the 2004 film Zee-Oui. =Gay films= Kathoey (transgender people) or gay people are often featured as comic relief or villains in mainstream Thai films, but there have been a number of films that make gay people and kathoey the main characters. Transgender people and gay people are also known as \\"tdoot\\", originated from the title of the 1982 American film Tootsie. One of the first was Youngyooth Thongkonthun's Iron Ladies, or Satree lek, based on a true story about a transgender gay men's volleyball team that won a national championship in 1996. It was a huge hit on the international festival circuit. The 2000 comedy spawned a sequel in 2003, The Iron Ladies 2 (Satree lek 2). More loosely based on a true incident was the 2002 film Saving Private Tootsie, which tells the story of a group of gay and kathoey entertainers who are lost in rebel-held jungle territory after their plane crashes. A squad from the Thai army, led by a gruff, homophobic sergeant played by veteran actor Sorapong Chatree, goes to the rescue. And the life of transgender Muay Thai champion Parinya Kiatbusaba (or Nong Tum) is related in 2003's Beautiful Boxer, directed by Ekachai Uekorngtham. Unlike The Iron Ladies, Beautiful Boxer was less comedic in tone. The 2003 film Tropical Malady, directed by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, depicts a romance between a Thai army soldier and a local small-town boy. The narrative of the film then abruptly shifts in the middle to relate a folk tale about a tiger shaman, with the soldier alone in the jungle, haunted by the tiger-shaman's spirit. The film won a jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Apichatpong also co-directed the low-budget digital movie, The Adventure of Iron Pussy, with artist Michael Shaowanasai, who portrays a transgender secret agent. A musical, the movie also was an homage and a parody of the Thai films of the 1960s and '70s, with Shaowansai basing his character on the actress Petchara Chaowarat. In 2005, Thai film Rainbow Boys, depicting a contemporary gay relationship, produced by Vitaya Saeng- aroon, saw a limited-release screening. Vitaya also produced the comedy-drama Club M2, set in a gay sauna.The real pride in being gay , The Nation (Thailand); retrieved 2007-11-17 And in 2006 there was The Last Song, a remake of a 1985 Thai film about a transsexual cabaret dancer and her struggle to find acceptance and true love. Me ... Myself ( or Kaw hai rak jong jaroen) is a 2007 Thai romantic drama film written and directed by actor-singer Pongpat Wachirabunjong. In the film, Ananda Everingham stars as a male dancer in a drag cabaret who must re-find himself after being struck by a car and suffering from amnesia. Another 2007 film, Bangkok Love Story, directed by Poj Arnon, was critically hailed as a departure from the stereotyped view of homosexuals as transvestites. Gay Thai independent film producer similarly praised the film, saying director Poj Arnon was \\"brave enough to shake society up\\". In 2011, Thanwarin Sukhaphisit's Insects in the Backyard, a movie depicting the struggles of a family in which a transgender teenage son and daughter's lives are tormented by a lack of communication and an inability to communicate with their biological father to the point that they end up selling their bodies looking, very much in vain, for a way out of their own lives, became the first film to receive the Haw Heep rating, which banned the distribution and showing of the film. There is one scene which the national board of film reviewers deemed to be pornographic in nature and therefore determined in an impediment to national order. In 2012, Thanwarin's It Gets Better is marketed to a more mainstream audience, and was admitted by the film committee. The film portrays the story of a young boy whose father forces him to become a monk after he catches him wearing his mother's clothes and dancing around effeminately in his room. At first the boy resists, but is then captivated by the beauty of the monk who comes out of the temple, and so immediately changes his mind. The story runs alongside two other narratives, one of a man returned to Thailand to sell his father's business and the other of a woman whose purpose seems unclear throughout the story until the very end. We find out that the monk is the woman, who has come back to see her father but is killed by a thief before she can make amends with him. It turns out the bar/dance club was hers and her death is the reason for her son's return to Thailand; his father's identity was kept from him his whole life, but after he learns everything from his biological father's office, he goes to see his grandfather and the story ends. =Historical epics= Another staple of the Thai film industry, among the biggest was 2003's The Legend of Suriyothai by Chatrichalerm Yukol, who had done research for many years to write the screenplay. With a huge budget, support from the royal family and the cooperation across the nation's film industry, this film is considered a true \\"national film\\".Chalida Uabumrungjit, Coming of Age of New Thai Cinema Thai film foundation A follow-up epic is 2007's King Naresuan, about 16th century ruler King Naresuan the Great, which topped the budget for Suriyothai, and was shown in two parts. Other epics include Bang Rajan by Thanit Jitnukul, who has made several other historical battle epics, including Sema: Warrior of Ayutthaya and Kun Pan: Legend of the Warlord. More recent history is depicted in The Overture, covering the life of a palace musician from the late 19th century to the 1940s, and The Tin Mine, set at a mine in southern Thailand in the 1950s. =Horror= Many of the Thai early horror movies such as 1958 Mae Nak Phra Khanong and 1973 movie Krasue Sao (Ghosts of Guts Eater), ,Ghosts of Guts Eater (Thailand 1973) featured Mae Nak and Krasue, ancient village ghosts of Thai folklore that became very popular. Nonzee Nimibutr's Nang Nak in 1999 was a ghost story based on the same folkloric theme that had been depicted dozens of times throughout the history of Thai cinema and television. But it gave rise to a new crop of Thai horror and suspense films, including the Pang Brothers' The Eye, Nonzee's pan-Asian compilation Three, Bangkok Haunted, directed by Pisuth Praesaeng-Iam and Oxide Pang and the 2004 box-office smash Shutter by Banjong Pisonthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom. In 2013, Pee Mak Phra Khanong, another spin-off from Mae Nak folklore, became an instant hit throughout Southeast Asia, earning more than ‡∏ø1 billion. Pee Mak is currently the highest grossing Thai film in the history of Thai cinema. Examples of slasher movies include Art of the Devil and a 2005 sequel (Long khong), as well as Scared and Narok (Hell), also in 2005. The horror genre also has spawned a number of genre-blending horror comedies, most notably the films of Yuthlert Sippapak, Buppah Rahtree (featured at the Toronto International Film Festival) and a sequel, and Krasue Valentine. There has even been a zombie movie, 2004's SARS Wars. =Musicals= The biggest hit musical was 1970's Monrak luk thung (Magical Love in the Countryside), starring Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat. It was hugely popular, playing in cinemas for six months. As a result, a whole genre of luk thung musicals, rhapsodizing Thailand's rural life in Isan was created. Another example was Dokdin Kanyamarn's 1971 musical comedy, Ai Tui (Mr. Tui), which starred Sombat Metanee and Petchara. In 2001 there were two movies that celebrated luk thung, the singing-contest comedy Monpleng Luk Thung FM (Hoedown Showdown) and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's, Monrak Transistor, which paid tribute to the music of Suraphol Sombatcharoen. And in 2005, comedian-actor-director Petchtai Wongkamlao wrote, directed and starred in Yam Yasothon, a colourful homage to the 1970s musicals. It was one of top films at the Thai box office. =Romance= Weepy, sentimental romance stories are audience favorites. Historically, Cherd Songsri's 1970s film Plae Chow (The Old Scar) is a classic tale of star- crossed lovers, and was one of the first Thai films to be a success internationally. During the 1980s, Baan Sai Thong based on the novel Kor Surangkanang was a popular hit.\\"Thai govt pins border hopes on soaps\\", The Nation (retrieved January 2, 2007. More recent examples include The Letter, in which tissues were actually handed out at the cinemas. Childhood romance was a hit with 2003's Fan Chan, which was made by six directors. One of the six, Komgrit Treewimol, went on to make the college-age romance, Dear Dakanda, a hit in 2005, but took three years to completely write, cast, film, and tweak. =Teen= As a genre, teen films arose in the 1970s, with director Piak Poster's Wai Ounlawon, about a young man whose courtship of a teenaged girl puts him at odds with the girl's irascible father. That young couple, portrayed by the original actors, were revisited 30 years later as embattled parents in the 2005 sequel, Wai Ounlawon 4 (Oops ... There's Dad). Music was an important component of the teen films, with a musical interlude featured prominently in the film and a soundtrack album that would be a popular hit. This was the case with both Wai Ounlawon and its recent sequel. Another noteworthy film of this genre is Fake, which was the debut film by Thanakorn Pongsuwan. The film's modern, visual style offers a sharp-focus snapshot of the city of Bangkok and a plausible account of the mating game in its current forms. =Short films= In the burgeoning independent film movement, many short films are being produced and featured in festivals. Graceland, a film by Anocha Suwichakornpong, about an Elvis impersonator, was featured in the Cin√©fondation competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first Thai short film selected at Cannes. Short-film festivals in Thailand include the Thai Short Film and Video Festival by the Thai Film Foundation and the Fat Film Festival by Fat Radio. Thai short-film programs are also put together for the Bangkok International Film Festival and the World Film Festival of Bangkok. for the past two years CNXWOOD Studios has co-sponsor a Film Festival, in the northern city of Chiang Mai in conjunction with Creative Kingdom Animation Studios Film. Pen-ek Ratanaruang's Twelve Twenty (30 min) was made as part of the Digital Short Films by Three Filmmakers project for the 2006 Jeonju International Film Festival. The film stars Ananda Everingham, has an appearance by American bilingual actor Erich Fleshman, and was shot by Christopher Doyle. The short film is shot in a minimalist style and slowly moves along the encounters of a man and a woman on a long-haul flight, where they spend the next 12 hours and 20 minutes reading, drinking, eating and watching movies and sleeping by each other's side without talking. In 2007, Digital Forum by Thai Film Foundation, Festival for a digital long-film Festivals and awards =Film festivals= The Thai Short Film and Video Festival was first held in 1997. The Bangkok Film Festival was started in 1998, and was eventually supplanted by the Bangkok International Film Festival, which started in 2002 and is organized by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The World Film Festival of Bangkok, sponsored by the Nation Multimedia Group, began in 2003, and it is held annually in October. In 2007, Digital Forum was begun in Bangkok as an outgrowth of the Thai Short Film and Video Festival, to showcase feature-length independent digital-video productions. Also in 2007, the inaugural Phuket Film Festival was held. In 2008, the annual Phangan Film Festival (PFF) was established on Koh Phangan, with a focus on spiritual and environmental indie films from around the world. In 2009, PFF's sister event, the annual Samui Film Festival (SFF) took place for the first time on Koh Samui. =Film awards= The first film awards in Thailand were the \\"Golden Doll\\" awards given by Tukata Tong magazine. The awards were first given in 1957. The statuette at first was a Thai classical dancer and later it was modelled after Phra Suratsawadi, the Thai-Hindu god of art. King Bhumibol Adulyadej handed out the awards in 1965 and '66. The Tukata Tong awards were discontinued after eight years due to organizational problems, but were revived in 1974 by the Association of Entertainment News Journalists of Thailand.

It joins Lucan's Main Street to the Lower Lucan Road, carrying traffic towards Clonsilla and the north. The bridge is the largest single span masonry arch bridge in Ireland, and is constructed from ashlar masonry with a span of 33 metres (110 feet) and a rise of 6.7 metres (22 feet). It is framed by iron balustraded parapets made by the Royal Phoenix ironworks of Parkgate Street in Dublin. Designed by George Knowles (architect of Dublin's Fr. Mathew and O'Donovan Rossa Bridges), it was built in 1814 in collaboration with James Savage to replace several previous bridges which were carried away by floods. The first bridge built on this spot was a stone bridge laid down in the later years of the reign of King John (c. 1200). A subsequent bridge was built by the first Agmondisham Vesey c. 1730, but washed away within very short time. The next was built c. 1771, but this too washed away in a flood in 1786 ‚Äì as did its replacement. In 1814, the present single-span bridge was completed by Savage & Knowles, and has remained largely unaffected by the effects of flooding common to this stretch of the Liffey. The bridge, however, has seen some recent developments, with the raising of the roadway near both ends of the arch to lessen the gradient for road traffic.

The main service book in current use is the Book of Common Worship (1993), published by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in cooperation with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. These books are not commonly used in the pews, but are resources for pastors in the preparation for Sunday worship, as well as for devotional use by church members and seminarians. Portions of these books are frequently found in the church bulletins, which become the liturgical booklet in many Presbyterian Churches. The Presbyterian Service Book and The Directory For Worship American Presbyterians have both a directory for worship and a service book. There is often a confusion over the distinction between the two, and over the role of each. A \\"Directory for Worship\\" is a part of the constitution of the church and thus has the authority of church law. It provides the theology that undergirds worship, and includes appropriate directions for worship. It sets forth the standards and the norms for the ordering of worship. It does have fixed orders of worship or liturgical texts. The church‚Äôs service book, on the other hand, provides orders and texts for worship. It is in harmony with the directory and is approved for voluntary use. Where both a directory and a service book coexist, as in those churches served by the Book of Common Worship (1993), the service book sets forth, in orders of services and in liturgical texts, the theology and norms described in the directory. Service books have a longer history in the Reformed tradition than directories, and most churches in the Reformed community do not have directories but do have service books. Service books of the 16th and 17th centuries Reformed churches in the sixteenth century used service books. Ulrich Zwingli, Martin Bucer, and John Calvin all prepared worship forms for use in the congregations. John Knox, following Calvin, prepared The Forme of Prayers and subsequently a service book, the Book of Common Order, for use in Scotland. Liturgical forms were in general use in Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Holland, England, and Scotland. However, the Reformation in England and Scotland after the death of Thomas Cranmer was formed in a very different context from that on the continent, where entire political entities were Reformed. The Reformed were thus able to prepare their own service books without interference. In England and Scotland those seeking to carry the reform from the continent had the difficult task of reforming within a state church hostile to Genevan-inspired reform. Even after the Scottish kirk was reformed under John Knox, it continued to endure English political and religious pressures, resulting in bitter conflict with the English crown. As the contending party in a state church, the Puritans were vulnerable. The liberty of the church to order its life and worship in harmony with the Word of God was threatened. The Puritans felt under attack by both church and nation. It was in worship that the conflict raged. The Puritans‚Äô struggle for liberty put them in direct conflict with those who had power to legislate the content of the service book and to require its use. Initially, the Puritan conflict was not about opposition to the propriety and use of a service book. The Puritans proposed their own service books. Rather, the conflict was about a service book that was being imposed upon the Puritans that did not reflect their concerns. The struggle ultimately drove the Puritans to join forces with the separatists. As a result, both the English Puritans and the Scots were forced into a more radical liturgical position than that of the reform on the continent, which did not have to face such issues. Whereas the Reformers were in a position to reform the forms of worship, the political and ecclesiastical situation compelled the Puritans, for the sake of liberty, to reject the forms thrust upon them. It was in this context that the Westminster Directory for the Publique Worship of God, devoid of liturgical text, was created in 1644, under the influence of Puritans and separatists. This directory was destined to play the dominant role in shaping the worship of American Presbyterians. It was at this moment in history that Puritans and Scots settled in the New World. They were the nucleus that initially shaped American Presbyterianism. Puritan views thus dominated the way the church took root in American soil. Opposition to service books continued even though the Puritans were no longer engaged in a struggle for liberty. The agenda remained, even though the context had changed. American Presbyterians soon forgot why they opposed service books. What began as a struggle for liberty turned into a new legalism. In keeping with their Puritan legacy, Presbyterians who settled in the New World chose to be served by a directory for worship rather than a service book. Colonial Presbyterians had the 1644 Westminster Directory available to them until, in 1788, the Westminster Directory was revised for use in the United States and subsequently adopted by the first General Assembly. Two generations after the first General Assembly, things began to change. Service books in the 19th century In the middle of the nineteenth century a movement emerged among American Presbyterians and other Reformed churches that sought to restore a liturgical tradition that was both Reformed and catholic, and thus to recover the values associated with use of a service book. Individuals began to write service books for use by Presbyterians. Toward the end of the century, demand for such resources prompted the publishing house of the northern Presbyterians to produce collections of liturgical forms. But it was the southern General Assembly that first extended official sanction to liturgical forms. In 1894 a directory for worship was adopted for use in the southern church that contained liturgical formulas, and liturgies for marriages and funerals were appended to it. Nine years later, the northern General Assembly was ready to respond positively to overtures calling for a book of services. Book of Common Worship (1906, 1932, and 1946) In 1903, in response to the growing expression of need for worship forms, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. (northern) approved overtures calling for the preparation of a book of services. The result was that the first Book of Common Worship was published in 1906. In approving this book, the church embraced the growing concern for the reform of Presbyterian worship. Although American Presbyterians had a directory for worship to guide them in liturgical matters, the approval of a service book gave official recognition to the value of liturgical orders and texts in shaping worship. The 1906 book was therefore a significant milepost in the reform of Presbyterian worship. It included orders with liturgical texts for both morning and evening Lord‚Äôs Day worship. It provided for celebrating Holy Communion, and included an exemplary eucharistic prayer (in this book called ‚Äúgreat thanksgiving‚Äù). Texts were provided for some festivals and seasons of the liturgical calendar. There were orders and liturgical texts for Baptism and for Confirmation of Baptismal Vows. A treasury of prayer, with family prayers, was included, as well as a selective psalter and a collection of ancient hymns and canticles. Congregational participation was encouraged with the provision of responses and unison prayers. This service book included prayers drawn from a wide range within the church catholic and from across many centuries. By 1928, the book began to appear dated. Responding to popular demand, the General Assembly appointed a committee to revise the Book of Common Worship. The revised edition appeared in 1932. This edition was an expanded version of the 1906 book. Texts for additional festivals and seasons were added. A rudimentary lectionary was included. It is significant that the southern General Assembly approved it for use by its congregations. Nine years later the northern General Assembly established a permanent committee on the revision of the Book of Common Worship to monitor the liturgical needs of the church and to periodically propose revisions. This underscores the importance that the Office of the General Assembly gave to the service book at that time. A thoroughgoing revision of the Book of Common Worship resulted in a new edition being published in 1946. Those who prepared this book had the advantage of increasing ecumenical liturgical scholarship and of more knowledge about the worship of the Reformers. This edition of the service book provided for still greater congregational participation. It contained expanded resources for Sunday morning and Sunday evening worship and for the celebration of the Lord‚Äôs Supper. The reading of scripture in worship was given emphasis by the addition of a complete two-year lectionary from the Church of Scotland‚Äôs Book of Common Order, published in 1940.The liturgical year also received increased emphasis, with prayers included from the service books of other churches. The Worshipbook (1970) In 1955 the northern General Assembly called for another revision. As the committee appointed to revise the Book of Common Worship began its work, it was confronted with the great disparity between the Directory for Worship and the Book of Common Worship. The committee reported back to the assembly that it could not proceed until a new directory was adopted to replace the existing one, which for the northern church had remained virtually unchanged since its adoption nearly one hundred and seventy years earlier. The southern Presbyterians joined with the northern church to produce the new service book but decided to prepare their own directory. Also joining the project was the United Presbyterian Church of North America, which in 1947 had published a book entitled The Manual for Worship, which included general guidelines for worship with some orders and liturgical texts. Before the new service book was completed, the United Presbyterian Church of North America had merged with the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. to form the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. The Cumberland Presbyterian Church also joined in the project to produce the new service book. The Cumberland Presbyterians later engaged in preparing a new Directory for Worship, which was approved by their General Assembly in 1984. Other Reformed churches participated in early phases of the development of a new Book of Common Worship. Work resumed on a revised Book of Common Worship when in 1961 the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., and in 1963 the Presbyterian Church in the U.S., adopted new directories. The committee distributed two trial use pieces prior to publication: one in 1964, another in 1966. In 1970 the service book was published with the title The Worshipbook‚ÄîServices. Two years later it was published as part of The Worshipbook‚ÄîServices and Hymns. The contributions of The Worshipbook are noteworthy. As the first of a wave of new service books among American denominations, it broke new ground. It departed from Elizabethan English and began the search for a suitable contemporary style of language appropriate for the worship of God. It set forth with clarity that the norm of Christian worship on the Lord‚Äôs Day is a service of the Word and Sacrament. Although six years earlier the committee had proposed a new lectionary, it recognized that the lectionary then being completed by the Roman Catholic Church was superior to the lectionary it had prepared. The committee therefore modified the Roman lectionary for use by Presbyterians and included it in the final publication of The Worshipbook. Other denominations also made revisions of the Roman lectionary. But with all of its contributions, The Worshipbook was vulnerable. Following Vatican Council II there was a great resurgence of liturgical reform that continues unabated in virtually every branch of the church. Service book revision was begun by every church that had a service book. Presbyterians began to recognize the need to go beyond The Worshipbook. It was therefore no surprise that a new service book was soon called for. Book of Common Worship (1993) In 1980 the General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. approved an overture from the Presbytery of the Cascades calling for ‚Äúa new book of services for corporate worship.‚Äù In adopting the overture, the General Assembly expressed the fervent hope that the new book would be ‚Äúan instrument for the renewal of the church at its life-giving center.‚ÄùMinutes of the General Assembly of the UPCUSA Immediately the Presbyterian Church in the United States and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church approved participation in the project. The process leading to a new service book called for the publication of trial-use resources prior to the finalization of the service book itself. Between 1984 and 1992 seven trial-use resources were published, each including proposed text for a portion of the service book. The trial-use volumes were published under the series title: Supplemental Liturgical Resources. Each volume was prepared by a task force chosen for the task. From fifty to one hundred congregations were invited to review testing drafts of each of these resources prior to its approval for publication. Suggestions received from these evaluations greatly contributed to the preparation of the final drafts, and thus to their usefulness in the church. Following the publication of each volume, evaluations and suggestions were received. These responses, based on their use, were carefully considered and were a valuable aid in revising the liturgical texts for inclusion in this book. In revised form the liturgical texts of the seven trial-use resources are included in this book. During the course of the development of this service book, the reunion in 1983 of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. and the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. to form the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) occurred. This resulted in the preparation of a new Directory for Worship. In the years that followed reunion, until the adoption of the new Directory for Worship in 1989, the preparation of the directory and the development of the service book followed parallel tracks. Because the work was concurrent, there was a creative exchange between the two tasks. Each influenced the other. Appearing four years after the adoption of the revised Directory, the final Book of Common Worship is consistent with the provisions of the Directory. This book does not include some liturgical resources that ordinarily are included in the previous service books, namely, ordinations, installations, and occasional services such as dedications. At the time of its publication, a major study on ordination is before the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). This had precluded the finalization of an ordination rite. The decision was made to do as other churches have done and produce a book of occasional services separate from the Book of Common Worship, which would include additional liturgical resources needed by the church, such as ordinations, installations, dedications, and other occasional services, and liturgies needed by presbyteries to fulfill their responsibilities. Book of Occasional Services In 1999, the Geneva Press published for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) a liturgical resource supplementing the 1993 Book of Common Worship, containing multiple services for ordination and installation, commissioning, dedications, marking transitions in congregations and governing bodies, together with additional prayers for various occasions. Publications of books in the 20th century Henry van Dyke and others were influential in the first publication of a liturgical book for American Presbyterians. It was published in 1906, followed by a revision in 1932.

Island Bridge and the surrounding area are so named because of the island formed here by the creation of a mill race towards the right bank while the main current flows to the left. The River Camac emerges from a tunnel further downstream towards Dublin Heuston railway station. History In 1577, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, while Sir Henry Sidney was Lord Deputy of Ireland, an arched stone bridge was built here to replace an earlier structure nearby at Kilmainham. This bridge was swept away by a flood in 1787, and between 1791 and 1793 the replacement bridge, that is standing today, was constructed. The structure is a single 32-metre span ashlar masonry elliptical arch bridge and was originally named Sarah's Bridge after Sarah Fane, Countess of Westmorland, wife of the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who laid the first stone on 22 June 1791. The bridge was renamed Island Bridge in 1922 following independence from Britain of the Free State, similarly to many other Dublin bridges originally named for British peers.

It airs a country music format called Big Country 102.9. The station is owned by Black Diamond Broadcast Holdings, LLC. History: A Dentist's Dream =Beginnings= WMKC (\\"MacKinaC\\"), owned by Mighty-Mac Broadcasting Corp., signed on in January 1982 by a Lansing dentist, Donald \\"Doc\\" Benson. Benson loved country music and wanted northern Michigan to have a WITL clone for when he traveled up north. He already owned an AM in St. Ignace, WIDG (\\"Widge By The (Mackinac) Bridge\\") 940. WIDG aired various formats, but usually was MOR. In December 1979 Doc Benson closed WIDG with a \\"dark\\" license until April 12, 1981. He had to bring WIDG-AM back on in order to continue the CP for WIDG-FM. Initially the station was to be WIDG-FM and be automated and be called \\"Big Country-102 FM.\\" TM Programming was hired to consult the station; they felt that the \\"Big Country\\" name was too \\"hickish\\" and insisted on something \\"slicker.\\" General Manager Rick Stone held a \\"name the FM\\" contest in which the winner would win a Big Mac sandwich from McDonald's. Joe Raica came up with WMKC, for \\"MacKinaC\\", the county of license. The station went on the air in February 1982 with Steve Cook as morning host, Chuck LaTour as News Director, Greg Salo mid-days, Tim O'Brien (Ahlborn) (also Program Director and assistant manager - later General Manager several times) afternoons and Joe Raica evenings. =WMKC in the 1980s= When WMKC signed on, they were known as \\"103-WMKC\\", playing an automated country format (TM Country). Mornings were live with the rest of the day voicetracked. Legend has it that Benson, although a huge country fan, hated songs that dealt with immoral issues. It has been reported, for example, that Benson would order his staff to edit \\"Dueling Banjos\\" by Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandell out of the TM reels with a razor blade and a marker because of the song's association with a movie (1972's Deliverance) featuring sodomy; however, the staffers sometimes reportedly slipped the song in anyway just for laughs. In 1985, the station's logo changed to \\"KC-103.\\" Doc attempted to capitalize on his love for WITL and tried to get the staff to say \\"KCing while you work\\" since WITL said \\"Witl [\\"Whittle\\", like \\"Whistle\\"] while you work The \\"KC-ing while you work\\" was never used on the air unless done sarcastically.\\" In 1987 the station dropped voice-tracking and added live announcers, but still used reel-to-reel music (TM had become TM-Century, then bought Drake-Chenault, so a variety of program consultants and services were used). WIDG changed to WLVM \\"We Love Michigan\\" and TM Programming's TM-OR middle of the road and nostalgia format. In 1985, the format, which Doc Benson reportedly hated, was dropped, and WIDG calls returned. In 1985 Doc obtained the CP (Construction Permit) for a new FM in Cadillac at 107.1 Cadillac, MI. Cadillac previously had a WITW and Doc reportedly believed he could capitalize on the \\"good will\\" of the other station's calls and came up with WYTW. It was called Y-107 and ran satellite adult contemporary music for a short period, but the station was unable to make enough money to pay its expenses. In 1989 WYTW changed to WCKC (\\"Cadillac KC Country\\") and simulcast with WMKC and WIDG (which he wouldn't allow to be changed to WMKC-AM). =The 1990s to today= In 1990 a new tower location for WMKC was obtained, moving the stick from Saint Ignace to north of Harbor Springs. The new signal covered much more territory, but lost Sault Ste. Marie (hence the later purchase by Northern Star of WMKD), and because of the new counties added, lost ABC News and Paul Harvey from the station. In 1996, Benson retired, selling WMKC, alongside WCKC and WIDG, to Straits area broadcast legend Del Reynolds. He would maintain KC Country, although he would change the Cadillac station to a simulcast of his classic rock station, WGFM/WGFN. Benson died on May 27, 2005. In 1998, Reynolds sold his assets to Calibre Communications, which had big plans for their newly acquired stations. WGFN became The Bear, retaining their classic rock format but adding Bob and Tom for mornings, smooth jazz WJZJ became The Zone, playing watered-down automated alternative rock, and KC Country gave way to K-Garth, stunting with all Garth Brooks music. Shortly after the K-Garth stunt, 102.9 brought back its regular country format, only as Big Country 102.9. The station's airstaff was canned, only allowing for one DJ, a morning man. Eventually, WMKC brought back a full-time airstaff, though mornings (Young & Verna) and nights (Lia) are syndicated. The KC Country name did live on for a while as WIDG flipped from satellite-fed oldies \\"Cool 940\\" to satellite-fed classic country as \\"Classic KC Country\\". After just over one year, the station flipped to Sporting News Radio (formerly One-on-One Sports) as \\"The Fan\\". In 1998, the sale between Calibre and Reynolds failed, and a new company, Northern Star, was formed to take over the stations. In early 2008, WMKC changed its city of license from St. Ignace to the small Cheboygan County community of Indian River. Some have suggested that an Upper Peninsula city of license made the station unpalatable to listeners and advertisers in the northern Lower Peninsula, and that the change in city of license takes WMKC one step closer to being a \\"Traverse City\\" station. WIDG-AM remains licensed to St. Ignace but is no longer co-owned, now airing Catholic programming. WMKC has also recently reimaged itself as \\"102.9 Big Country Hits,\\" a reference to sister station WLJZ 94.5 FM's format change to classic country as \\"Big Country Gold.\\" \\"Big Country Gold\\" programming is now heard on WCBY 1240 AM, while WLJZ (now WYPV) now plays classic rock. WAVC From 2001 to April 2010, WMKC programming was also simulcast on WAVC 93.9 FM licensed to Mio, Michigan. That station is now a simulcast of classic-rock formatted sister station WGFN 98.1 FM (\\"The Bear\\"), leaving WMKC as the sole \\"Big Country\\" outlet.

It is one way to determine how profitable the seller's inventory is, and describes the relationship between the profit earned from total sales, and the amount invested in the inventory sold. Generally for a seller, the higher the GMROII the better. Since the inventory is a very widely ranging factor in a seller's investment in working capital, it is important for the seller to know how much he might expect to gain from it. The GMROII answers the question \\"for each unit of average inventory held at cost, how many units of currency of gross profit I generated in one year?\\" GMROII is traditionally calculated by using one year's gross profit against the average of 12 or 13 units of inventory at cost. GMROII may vary depending on which segment we are analyzing (Women Apparel, Toys, Home, Sport Ware, etc.), but a rule of thumb is that a GMROII of typical retailer is above 3.0.PWC's Retail Benchmarking Survey. November 2013. http://www.retailcouncil.org/sites/default/files/documents/pwc-benchmarking- study-2013-11-en.pdf GMROII in the Retail Industry  GMROII is particularly important in the retail industry where stock turn (i.e. sales units divided by average inventory units) and Gross Margin Percent can vary heavily by item, market segment, location, and period. GMROII can act as the main driver for retailers to analyze their product and store offering. This metric does not suffer from the major disadvantages some of the other main performance metrics do. For example: *Products or stores with high sales often have lower margin or excessive inventory *Products with a high stock turns often have a low margin *High margin items are often slow sellers and thus produce low profits *High profit products often have low margin, high volume sales but also high inventory levels that prevent other products from being displayed and sold Retailers usually drive their business based on sales or margin. In a retailer where budgets and bonuses are based on sales, employees often achieve that by lowering the margin or putting too much stock in their stores. A high GMROII indicates a good balance of sales, margin, and inventory cost. Average GMROII  Financial textbooks often show a formula with a yearly or monthly calculation. When tactical decisions are required for variable time periods, it is helpful for systems to be set up so that GMROII can be analyzed at either the yearly, monthly, or weekly level. Due to the textbook GMROII formula, depending on the time period, a different result would occur. For example: *($100,000 annual profit) / ($25,000 average inventory cost) = GMROII of 4.0 *($8,000 July profit) / ($25,000 average inventory cost) = GMROII of 0.32 *($4,000 first two weeks of July profit) / ($25,000 average inventory cost) = GMROII of 0.16 Therefore, it is advantageous to use Average Weekly GMROII which takes time out of the picture. That way, the retailer looks at similar types of numbers regardless of how many weeks are being looked at. The formula is: Average Weekly GMROII = (Profits for the total time period) / (Sum of week ending inventory cost value) Alternative Formulas for GMROII  Other formulas that are often given for GMROII are the following (note that all of these are mathematically equivalent because all can be reduced down to Margin/Avg_Inventory_cost): (Margin % / (100% - Margin %) ) * Annual Inventory Turns (Margin/COGS) * Annual Inventory Turns Margin % * (Sales / Avg Inventory Cost) In the formulas used here, \\"Margin %\\" refers to margin as a percent of sales, \\"Annual Inventory Turns\\" refers to COGS / Avg Inventory Cost. American Levi's GMROII American Levi's GMROIIhttp://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/clc/964945 is a hybrid of GMROII and GMROS (Gross Margin Return On Space) that takes the selling price of an article into account: Selling Price * GMROII Selling Price * Margin % * Annual Inventory Turns When deciding whether to stock jeans in a retail store, it makes more sense for Levi's to sell jeans for $100 rather than jeans for $10, if they both have the same conventional GMROII. By using the American Levi's GMROII, you see that the $100 jeans deliver 10 times the margin dollars on the space occupied by each pair of jeans in stock, compared to the $10 jeans. Net Profit will increase more than 10 times due to operating leverage. Note that GMROS can be calculated by multiplying American Levi's GMROII by Density (Units per square foot). Gross Margin Dollars per Square Foot: American Levi's GMROII * Density Short-coming of GMROII  A short-coming of GMROII driven analysis is that items with high sell-offs (i.e. the final stock level falls towards zero) appear better than items with constant inventory supplies. Fashionable items that totally sold off will appear better than basic items such as black socks that are replenished by reorders. This is particularly evident when analyzing shorter time periods or item level information rather than higher level (department) information.

A Deluxe Edition was also released that same year, containing copies of both Beyond Divinity and Divine Divinity. In 2009 a digital download version was released, equivalent to the updated disc version. The game was released for Mac OS X on November 15, 2013. Gameplay The gameplay is heavily based on Divine Divinity, but adds the ability for the player to control two characters, each with their own stats and equipment. Beyond Divinity is divided into four acts; the first was designed to be relatively linear, but it opens up towards the end, and later acts have much more freedom of movement. The player can acquire a new summoning doll in each act, allowing the player to summon a specific creature, including a skeleton doll in Act 1 capable of wielding a crossbow to provide ranged support. The player can control these summons directly (and depending on the doll, even give them some of your spare equipment to use) to help in combat, or simply use to carry loot. There is a Battlefield (an area that contains merchants and some optional, randomly generated dungeons) in each act, that, once unlocked, the player can teleport in and out of whenever they wish. Synopsis The storyline of Beyond Divinity takes place 20 years after the original game. The player takes on the role of a servant of the divine one, a paladin who hates and hunts necromancers. During the battle with one particularly vile necromancer, the paladin is grabbed by a demon, Samuel, and dragged into another universe where he is soul-forged to a death-knight, a creature of evil. Together another paladin and death-knight must venture forth to find a way to break that forging. To succeed is to resume the path you have set for yourself. To fail is to spend eternity linked to that which you have despised. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

To date, NGL has dedicated 11 memorials located in Arlington National Cemetery and sponsors numerous other programs. The name is derived from the verse John 15:13 from the Bible.  Origin  As a White House Special Projects Aide during the Vietnam War, Ms. LaSpada organized a USO tour to Southeast Asia with her friend, the journalist and humorist, Art Buchwald. Visiting a military hospital, she met a battle-injured medic who had seen 35 men in his unit die before he himself was mortally wounded. The young man asked that she promise to do something so that his comrades and their grieving families would be remembered. She agreed, accepting from him a black scarf - a symbol of his unit - to seal her promise.  Programs  NGL has initiated many programs to encourage remembrance and increase morale of those affected by war: *The annual National Moment of Remembrance, initiated in 1997. All Americans are asked to pause at 3:00 p.m. (local time) on Memorial Day to observe a moment of silence to honor those who have died for freedom. The National Moment of Remembrance was formally established by an act of Congress on December 28, 2000 and is now sponsored by the White House Commission on Remembrance. *First National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans initiated in 1974. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs now sponsors this annual program. *Holiday Remembrance Gifts Send-Off, begun in 1971, an annual tradition of sending holiday gifts to children who have lost a parent to war. *Annual Tribute to Those Who Died in the Gulf War, begun in 1992 with the cooperation of the people of Kuwait, is the only tribute that brings together annually families whose loved ones died in the Persian Gulf. *Pledge of Peace, created in 1985 and was recognized by the United Nations and is recited by children at most NGL events. *Operation Valentine initiated in 1993 to boost the morale of U.S. troops on peacekeeping missions by having children send homemade valentines to the troops. *Yellow Ribbon Campaign. When Americans were taken hostage in Iran in 1979, the wearing of a yellow ribbon was a symbol of America's shared concern for those being denied their freedom. *International Commemoration for all Victims of Terrorism, begun in 1984, the only tribute in the world specifically for victims of terrorism. *Editor's Choice Awards, started in 1976, was the first organized national recognition of Vietnam War veterans for their post-war contributions to the nation.

History As the Liffey flows into the town of Chapelizod, a weir divides the course to form a large mill race. Split by the two bodies of water, the island at Chapelizod has been a base for industry since at least the 18th century. The main flow is crossed by a four-span stone arch bridge, having two large central spans and two much smaller end spans. This bridge was built in the 1660s, and originally named Chapelizod Bridge. The bridge was renamed in 1982 to mark the centenary of James Joyce's birth. (The bridge is mentioned in Joyce's Dubliners, as one of his \\"Dubliners\\", James Duffy, lives in Chapelizod and visits a public house near the bridge. Anna Livia is the name given to the personification of the River Liffey, and was a principal character in Joyce's Finnegans Wake - her final monologue recalls her life as she walks along the Liffey.) Plaque on the bridge Recent developments As the only bridge 8 km past the Strawberry Beds to Chapelizod, and a main thoroughfare for traffic from the western suburbs (e.g.: Clonsilla and Blanchardstown) to Dublin city center, the volume of road traffic over the bridge and through Chapelizod has increased in recent years. Dublin City Council planned changes to bridge, as part of a general \\"Traffic Management Plan for the Chapelizod area\\". The changes include the construction of separate footbridge sections outside the parapets of the bridge (to improve pedestrian safety), and the creation of cycle lanes on the bridge. Preparatory works for this initiative commenced in 2010 and the official opening was held in December 2011.

Farmleigh Bridge is a single-span cast iron box truss bridge. It is about long and is supported by two stone and masonry supports faced with cut limestone blocks, and embellished with buttresses and round-headed arches. Probably built by the engineering department of the Guinness Brewery, it was built in the 1870s to carry water pipes and electricity lines from the mill race turbine to the nearby Farmleigh House and the clock tower (which housed a large water tank), by Edward Cecil Guinness who had bought the estate in 1872. There were ornate gates at either end of the bridge and a tunnel entrance where it ended abruptly in the side of a hill. The pipes and cables were covered by a deck for pedestrian use. Privately built by the Guinness family, it was also used by staff who lived on the south side of the river (by Palmerstown) as a short-cut to the grand house.

With CERF‚Äôs objectives to 1) promote early action and response to reduce loss of life; 2) enhance response to time-critical requirements; and 3) strengthen core elements of humanitarian response in underfunded crises, CERF seeks to enable more timely and reliable humanitarian assistance to those affected by natural disasters and armed conflicts. The fund is replenished annually through contributions from governments, the private sector, foundations and individuals. From the fund‚Äôs inception till August 2013, donors include 125 Member States and more than 30 private donors and regional authorities. History and background CERF was created by all nations, for all potential victims of disasters. It represents a real chance to provide predictable and equitable funding to those affected by natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies. The fund was established to upgrade the Central Emergency Revolving Fund by including a grant element.

Management CERF is managed, on behalf of the United Nations Secretary- General, by the Under-Secretary-General (USG) and Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), Mark Lowcock, Head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).http://www.unocha.org/ OCHA is the part of the United Nations Secretariat responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies. CERF is a vital component of this effort. Lisa Doughten is the Chief of the CERF secretariat. Before coming to CERF, Ms. Doughten has worked in more than 30 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East in both the United Nations and the private sector. Advisory Group The CERF Advisory Group provides the Secretary-General with periodic policy guidance and expert advice on the use and impact of CERF. Advisory Group members serve in their individual capacity and not as representatives of their countries or governments. They include government officials from contributing and recipient countries, representatives of humanitarian non-governmental organizations and academic experts, whom are carefully selected to reflect a geographical and gender balance.http://www.unocha.org/cerf/about-us/advisory-group As of September 2013, the CERF Advisory Group consists of: * Carlos Eduardo Zaballa (Argentina) * Catherine Walker (Australia) * Jan Vandemoortele (Belgium) * Stephen Salewicz (Canada) * Wenliang Yao (China) * Nancy Butijer (Croatia) * Mathewos Hunde Tulu (Ethiopia) * Yukie Osa (Japan) * Saadatou Mallam Barmou (Niger) * Susan Eckey (Norway) * Biya Han (Republic of Korea) * Susanna Moorehead (United Kingdom) * Brouz Ralph Enneric Coffi (C√¥te d'Ivoire) * Jette Michelsen (Denmark) * Eltje Aderhold (Germany) * Ahmed Al-Meraikhi (Qatar) * Jozef H.L.M. Andriessen (The Netherlands) * Julius Oketta (Uganda). Impact As crises proliferate worldwide, the CERF secretariat continues to receive more requests for funding than before. In 2012, CERF disbursed $485 million for 546 projects in 49 countries and territories ‚Äì this is the highest amount since the fund‚Äôs inception. The ten largest recipients were South Sudan, Pakistan, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Yemen, Sudan, Myanmar, Burkina Faso and Chad, whereas the food, health, and water and sanitation (WASH) sectors continued to be among the most highly funded sectors, receiving approximately $247 million, or nearly 52 per cent, of the $477 million CERF allocated in 2012. Allocations The CERF grant element is divided into two windows: one for Rapid Responseshttp://www.unocha.org/cerf/resources/how-apply/rapid-response-0 (approximately two thirds of the grant element) and the other for Underfunded Emergencieshttp://www.unocha.org/cerf/resources/how-apply/underfunded- emergencies-0 (approximately one third of the grant element). The grant element pools funds from several donors and adopts a decentralized, field- based approach to decision-making. The Rapid Response window provides funds intended to mitigate the unevenness and delays of the voluntary contribution system by providing seed money for life-saving, humanitarian activities in the initial days and weeks of a sudden onset crisis or a deterioration in an ongoing situation. In parallel to the CERF Rapid Response grant, agencies will be looking for others sources of funding to complement the CERF funds. The maximum amount applied to a crisis in a given year typically does not exceed $30 million, although higher allocations can be made in exceptional circumstances.http://www.unocha.org/cerf/resources/apply-cerf-funds The Underfunded Emergencies window supports countries that are significantly challenged by ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù emergencies.http://www.unocha.org/cerf/resources/guidance-and-templates With technical support from the CERF secretariat, the ERC selects countries to benefit from the CERF underfunded emergencies window. The ERC also decides on an allocation amount per country and makes recommendations on the use of underfunded emergencies grants in selected countries.http://www.unocha.org/cerf/resources/apply-cerf-funds Contributions Despite the financial crisis and its effects on Member States¬¥ budgets, donations to CERF have increased compared to earlier years. Since 2006, CERF has received more than $3.2 billion in contributions and pledges. Close to 99 per cent of the contributions were from Member States, with the United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway being the top three donors to CERF.

It is a wrought iron box truss structure, and joins lines from Heuston Station to Connolly Station through the Phoenix Park Tunnel. Historically used primarily for freight traffic, in November 2016, the bridge and tunnel were reopened to more regular passenger traffic. History The bridge and tunnel were built by the Great Southern and Western Railway (GSWR) company to connect Kingsbridge station to the Dublin docklands. Before the line was built the Midland & Great Western Railway (MGWR) company had built a railway along the Royal Canal which enabled them to transport goods directly from Spencer Dock to Broadstone station where MGWR was based. The GSWR had to transfer the goods from the docks by road to Heuston which was time-consuming and costly so they built the line to connect with the MGWR line at Cabra. Later, because of the cost that MGWR were charging GSR for use of its line to the docklands, a new line was built directly to the docklands. For some time, the bridge and tunnel were not used for regular passenger services, and traffic over the bridge was largely limited to freight traffic and for shunting of engines between Connolly and Heuston. An exception to this was occasional match-day services carrying Gaelic Athletic Association fans from southern lines to Connolly Station for Croke Park stadium. However, from the early 21st century, rail transport planners and interest groups such as Platform 11 debated the use of the bridge and tunnel to link the operationally separate passenger lines which then terminated at Heuston and Connolly stations. Ultimately, in November 2016, the bridge and tunnel were reopened to more regular passenger traffic.

A tortured artist is a stock character and real-life stereotype who is in constant torment due to frustrations with art, other people, or the world in general.  Background  The trope of the tortured artist is thought to have been started by Plato. Creativity and mental illness have been connected over time. Some mental disorders, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, have been said to have helped popular artists with their works. One of the most known tortured artists is Vincent Van Gogh, who suffered from psychosis.

Thucydides describes it as situated in the district Elaeatis in Thesprotia, away from the sea.For a map of this region in northwestern Greece, see map 20 in Pedro Olalla's Mythological Atlas of Greece (Athens: Road Editions, 2002). At its site is the famous Necromanteion (ŒùŒµŒ∫œÅŒøŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµ·øñŒøŒΩ, \\"Oracle of the Dead\\"). First settled during the Bronze Age and resettled in the 14th century BC by colonists most probably from Chaonia and the west Peloponnese region. The city is about 800 m north of the junction of the Kokytos River with the Acheron, and about 4.5 km east of the bay of Ammoudia. Near it was the outlet into the sea of the Acherusian Lake. Strabo (7.7.5) gives the same information and adds that in his time Ephyra was called Kichyros. The name had been changed from Ephyra back to the more ancient name about 200 years earlier.Olalla, op.cit. p. 39. Mythology In Greek mythology, Neoptolemos was said to have landed at Kichyros (Ephyra) on his return from Troy (Pind. Nem. 7.37-39) and Odysseus went there earlier, before leaving for Troy (Od. 1 .210-211) to get poison for his arrows (Od. 1 .259f).Strabo considered that the Ephyra meant here by the poet, was Ephyra (Thessaly), not the Thesprotian town. Theseus and Perithoos came to snatch away Persephone, wife of Aidoneus, King of Ephyra. These were none other than Persephone and Hades, the gods of the underworld, who had a shrine and an oracle at Ephyra.Pausanias 1.17.4-5, 9.36.3; Plut. Theseus 31.35. Heracles subjugated Ephyra and fathered a child by Princess Astyoche, Tlepolemus, who became king of Rhodes.Olalla, op.cit., p. 161. Thyestes came there looking for his brother, Atreus. Atreus was not there, but the daughter of Thyestes, Pelopia, was there, and Thyestes, not recognizing her, took her as a wife. Their union produced Aegisthus.Olalla, op.cit. p. 89. History The Thesprotian Kichyros/Ephyra appears to be the town mentioned in two passages of the Odyssey (i. 259, ii. 328). The Ephyri, mentioned in a passage of the Iliad (xiii. 301), were supposed by Pausanias to be the Thesprotians inhabitants of the town.Pausanias ix. 36.3. but Strabo maintained that the poet referred to the Thessalian Ephyra (Strab. ix. p. 442). Some commentators even supposed the Ephyra on the SelleeisHomer. Iliad, ii.659, xv.531. to be the Thesprotian town, but Strabo expressly maintains that Homer alludes in these passages to the Eleian town.Strabo vii. p. 328,; comp. viii. p. 338. Pausanias represents Cichyrus as the capital of the ancient kings of Thesprotia, where Theseus and Peirithous were thrown into chains by Aidoneus; and its celebrity in the most ancient times may also be inferred from a passage of Pindar.Pausanias i.17.4; Pind. Nem. vii.55.; William Martin Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 7, vol. iv. pp. 53, 175. Information on the location The site of Ephyra is confirmed by the excavation of the ancient oracle of the dead, Necromanteion, on the hill of Agios Ioannis near the village of Mesopotamo, 150 m north of the junction of the Kokytos with the Acheron. The remains of three ancient wall circuits are preserved on the limestone nearby hill of Xylokastro. The finds within the acropolis, chiefly sherds of local pottery of the Bronze Age and Mycenaean sherds, together with the worship of the chthonic goddess Persephone. After the surrender of the Elean colonies in Kassopaia to Philip II of Macedon in 343-342 BC, (Dem. 7.32) and their subjection to the Thesprotians, Ephyra appears to have reverted to its original name, Kichyros, which had been kept alive in some neighboring Thesprotian settlement.Kichyros, the former Ephyra: Strabo 7.7.5, 8.3.5. Some finds, chiefly pottery of the 1st century BC, confirm the statement of Pausanias (1.17.5) that Kichyros was in existence in his time. Archaeology Part of the remains of Necromanteion, with the church of the monastery Agios Ioannis in the background on the right. The remains of the ancient Ephira are near the present Ioannina. In the period between 1958 and 1987, several excavations were conducted by a team from the University of Ioannina that were later expanded between 2006 and 2008. In them, archaeologists found remains of the only Mycenaean acropolis whose existence has been confirmed within the region of Epirus. Two of the three walls of the fortification that were found in the southern part of the acropolis, were built in stone with Cyclopean style in the fourteenth or early thirteenth century BC, while the third is much later, of the Hellenistic period. On the other hand, on a plateau on the western side of the acropolis, three large funerary burial mounds of the 12th century BC have been found. = 19870 Page of the Ministry of Culture and Sports of Greece: Ephyra See also *List of ancient Greek cities *List of cities in ancient Epirus References =Citations= =Sources= External links *The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites Cities in ancient Epirus Former populated places in Greece Locations in Greek mythology Populated places in ancient Epirus Archaeological sites in Epirus (region) ","title":"Cichyrus"},{"id":"4334000","text":"Shadow Dancer may refer to: * Shadow Dancer, side-scrolling action game produced by Sega originally released as an arcade game in 1989 * Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi, side-scrolling action game produced by Sega originally released for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1990 * Shadow Dancer (band), British techno band * Shadow Dancer (film), 2012 British-Irish drama film directed by James Marsh ","title":"Shadow Dancer (disambiguation)"},{"id":"4334001","text":"Logical Design Works, Inc. is a now-defunct US-based video game developer that developed games between 1983 and 1993.

RO is a perennial competitor in the annual International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella competition. In the 2005-2006 ICCA competition, RO took first place overall in the Quarterfinal round held at USC's Bovard Auditorium.

At the West Seminfal round, held at Stanford University on March 18, 2006, RO placed 2nd overall. Due to a timing error, however, the judges missed a significant portion of Reverse Osmosis' performance. RO was then invited to the final round so that they could have a fair chance to perform their set in full for the ICCA judges, thus becoming the first group from USC to reach the ICCA Finals. On April 29, 2006, RO performed their award-winning set at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall in New York City. Once again, they were awarded best vocal percussion (Baraka May for \\"Fix You\\").

One is the present day Barnum Island, which includes the villages of Island Park and Harbor Isle in Nassau County. The other was a mile-long (1600 m) barrier island that existed to the south of Rockaway Beach in Queens before being mostly destroyed by the 1893 New York hurricane and completely lost to erosion and storm damage by 1902.  Barnum Island  The Barnum Island/Island Park/Harbor Isle \\"Hog Island\\" was used by the Native Americans to raise pigs, once they had been introduced by Europeans and left to run feral. It later became a small farming area. In 1874 Sarah Ann Baldwin Barnum (unrelated to P.T. Barnum, despite local lore) purchased the property. A syndicate of businessmen were about to bid $70,000 for the property, but she persuaded the owner to sell it to her for use as a working farm, to house and employ the poor. While she made the purchase with $13,360 of her own money, she immediately resold it to the Queens County government for the same price; at the time, Nassau was part of Queens. In 1898, the county closed the almshouse, and sold the property to developers for $40,000. In 1926, much of the island was incorporated as the Village of Island Park. The remainder is still unincorporated: the northeast portion of the island continues to be known as Barnum Island, while the western portion is called Harbor Island. All three are part of the Town of Hempstead.  Lost island  = History = Sea movement built up a large sandbar. Reports suggest that it began to emerge from the ocean during the Civil War period. It was about 1,000 feet south of the Rockaway shore. Eventually, it grew to about a mile long (parallel to the Rockaways) and several hundred feet wide. Shaped like a hogback, it came to be known as Hog Island, or sometimes as Far Rockaway Beach Island. The island attracted developers of various seafront beach resort businesses, including leisure pavilions, bathing facilities, saloons, restaurants. It was a favorite getaway of Tammany Hall politicians, and many \\"backroom deals\\" were actually concluded in the open air here. A winter storm in early 1893 severely damaged the island. In late August 1893, several hurricanes were simultaneously active in the Atlantic Ocean. On August 22, 1893 strong waves covered Hog Island and reduced its size but left it generally intact, though accounts conflict on the level of damage. The following evening, overnight, a devastating hurricane made landfall in New York City, lasting from about 8:00 PM Wednesday to 8:00 AM on Thursday. Alt URL 30 foot (9m) waves were reported at Coney Island as far as 200 yards (180 m) inland, destroying the elevated railroad there, and the East River crested the sea wall in the Astoria district; waist-high water was reported in the streets of the City of Brooklyn.) Much of Hog Island disappeared. News reports included a dramatic rescue from the island. After the 1893 storm, some redevelopment occurred on the now-reduced Hog Island. It was further damaged in an 1896 storm, and believed to have eroded in its entirety in 1902. = Rediscovery = In the mid-1990s, after the nor'easters of December 1992 and March 1993 heavily damaged the coast of Rockaway, the Army Corps of Engineers began rebuilding Rockaway Peninsula beaches. They used sands dredged close to shore. Professor Nicholas Coch of Queens College, along with local undergraduate students, was observing the work and its results, replenishing of the beaches along Rockaway when they noticed peculiar items along the coast. The group uncovered hundreds of different artifacts including whiskey bottles, beer mugs, and even a hurricane lamp. The majority of the items were dated around the late 19th century. Coch believes they came from Hog Island, but admits they could have been the result of the 1893 storm's devastation in other nearby resort areas. Curious about their findings, the Queens College group started to unravel the history of Hog Island. Their research also led to a reassessment of the frequency of major hurricanes in the New York City area (see Analysis, below). =Analysis= The city of New York has averaged a major hurricane approximately every 70 to 80 years throughout its history. It was predicted in 2005 that if the city were to be directly hit by another hurricane of the intensity of the one in 1893, which destroyed Hog Island, the damage was likely to be enormous. In 2012, the effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York were very destructive but was not a worst-case scenario, especially in terms of wind. A landfalling Category 3 or higher would prove to be far more destructive.

Intertidal ecology is the study of intertidal ecosystems, where organisms live between the low and high tide lines. At low tide, the intertidal is exposed whereas at high tide, the intertidal is underwater. Intertidal ecologists therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment, as well as between different species of intertidal organisms within a particular intertidal community. The most important environmental and species interactions may vary based on the type of intertidal community being studied, the broadest of classifications being based on substrates‚Äîrocky shore and soft bottom communities. Organisms living in this zone have a highly variable and often hostile environment, and have evolved various adaptations to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature of intertidal communities is vertical zonation, where the community is divided into distinct vertical bands of specific species going up the shore. Species ability to cope with abiotic factors associated with emersion stress, such as desiccation determines their upper limits, while biotic interactions e.g.competition with other species sets their lower limits. Intertidal regions are utilized by humans for food and recreation, but anthropogenic actions also have major impacts, with overexploitation, invasive species and climate change being among the problems faced by intertidal communities. In some places Marine Protected Areas have been established to protect these areas and aid in scientific research.National Academy of Sciences. Marine protected areas: tools for sustaining ocean ecosystems/ Committee on the evaluation, design, and monitoring of marine reserves and protected areas in the United States Ocean Studies Board Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources National Research Council. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 2001 Types of intertidal communities Intertidal habitats can be characterized as having either hard or soft bottoms substrates. Rocky intertidal communities occur on rocky shores, such as headlands, cobble beaches, or human-made jetties. Their degree of exposure may be calculated using the Ballantine Scale.Ballantine, W.J. (1961). \\"A Biologically-defined Exposure Scale for the Comparative Description of Rocky Shores\\". Field Studies Journal. 1 (3). Soft- sediment habitats include sandy beaches, and intertidal wetlands (e.g., mudflats and salt marshes). These habitats differ in levels of abiotic, or non-living, environmental factors. Rocky shores tend to have higher wave action, requiring adaptations allowing the inhabitants to cling tightly to the rocks. Soft-bottom habitats are generally protected from large waves but tend to have more variable salinity levels. They also offer a third habitable dimension: depth. Thus, many soft-sediment inhabitants are adapted for burrowing.Kelleher, Graeme; Bleakley, Chris; Wells, Sue C. A Global Representative System of Marine Protected Areas: Antarctic, Arctic, Mediterranean, Northwest Atlantic and Baltic (partial document). Vol. I. Washington, D.C.: The International Bank for Reconstruction/The World Bank, 1995. Environment A rock, seen at low tide, exhibiting typical intertidal zonation. Because intertidal organisms endure regular periods of immersion and emersion, they essentially live both underwater and on land and must be adapted to a large range of climatic conditions. The intensity of climate stressors varies with relative tide height because organisms living in areas with higher tide heights are emersed for longer periods than those living in areas with lower tide heights. This gradient of climate with tide height leads to patterns of intertidal zonation, with high intertidal species being more adapted to emersion stresses than low intertidal species. These adaptations may be behavioral (i.e. movements or actions), morphological (i.e. characteristics of external body structure), or physiological (i.e. internal functions of cells and organs). In addition, such adaptations generally cost the organism in terms of energy (e.g. to move or to grow certain structures), leading to trade-offs (i.e. spending more energy on deterring predators leaves less energy for other functions like reproduction). Intertidal organisms, especially those in the high intertidal, must cope with a large range of temperatures. While they are underwater, temperatures may only vary by a few degrees over the year. However, at low tide, temperatures may dip to below freezing or may become scaldingly hot, leading to a temperature range that may approach 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) during a period of a few hours. Many mobile organisms, such as snails and crabs, avoid temperature fluctuations by crawling around and searching for food at high tide and hiding in cool, moist refuges (crevices or burrows) at low tide. Besides simply living at lower tide heights, non-motile organisms may be more dependent on coping mechanisms. For example, high intertidal organisms have a stronger stress response, a physiological response of making proteins that help recovery from temperature stress just as the immune response aids in the recovery from infection. Intertidal organisms are also especially prone to desiccation during periods of emersion. Again, mobile organisms avoid desiccation in the same way as they avoid extreme temperatures: by hunkering down in mild and moist refuges. Many intertidal organisms, including Littorina snails, prevent water loss by having waterproof outer surfaces, pulling completely into their shells, and sealing shut their shell opening. Limpets (Patella) do not use such a sealing plate but occupy a home-scar to which they seal the lower edge of their flattened conical shell using a grinding action. They return to this home-scar after each grazing excursion, typically just before emersion. On soft rocks, these scars are quite obvious. Still other organisms, such as the algae Ulva and Porphyra, are able to rehydrate and recover after periods of severe desiccation. The level of salinity can also be quite variable. Low salinities can be caused by rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially euryhaline, or able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots. In addition to these exposure stresses (temperature, desiccation, and salinity), intertidal organisms experience strong mechanical stresses, especially in locations of high wave action. There are myriad ways in which the organisms prevent dislodgement due to waves. Morphologically, many mollusks (such as limpets and chitons) have low-profile, hydrodynamic shells. Types of substrate attachments include mussels' tethering byssal threads and glues, sea stars' thousands of suctioning tube feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal kelps. Higher profile organisms, such as kelps, must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of mechanical stresses include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc. For each of these climate stresses, species exist that are adapted to and thrive in the most stressful of locations. For example, the tiny crustacean copepod Tigriopus thrives in very salty, high intertidal tidepools, and many filter feeders find more to eat in wavier and higher flow locations. Adapting to such challenging environments gives these species competitive edges in such locations. Food web structure Semibalanus balanoides During tidal immersion, the food supply to intertidal organisms is subsidized by materials carried in seawater, including photosynthesizing phytoplankton and consumer zooplankton. These plankton are eaten by numerous forms of filter feeders‚Äîmussels, clams, barnacles, sea squirts, and polychaete worms‚Äîwhich filter seawater in their search for planktonic food sources. The adjacent ocean is also a primary source of nutrients for autotrophs, photosynthesizing producers ranging in size from microscopic algae (e.g. benthic diatoms) to huge kelps and other seaweeds. These intertidal producers are eaten by herbivorous grazers, such as limpets that scrape rocks clean of their diatom layer and kelp crabs that creep along blades of the feather boa kelp Egregia eating the tiny leaf-shaped bladelets. Crabs are eaten by goliath grouper, which are then eaten by sharks. Higher up the food web, predatory consumers‚Äîespecially voracious starfish‚Äîeat other grazers (e.g. snails) and filter feeders (e.g. mussels). Finally, scavengers, including crabs and sand fleas, eat dead organic material, including dead producers and consumers. Species interactions Tide pools with sea stars and sea anemone in Santa Cruz, California In addition to being shaped by aspects of climate, intertidal habitats‚Äîespecially intertidal zonation patterns‚Äîare strongly influenced by species interactions, such as predation, competition, facilitation, and indirect interactions. Ultimately, these interactions feed into the food web structure, described above. Intertidal habitats have been a model system for many classic ecological studies, including those introduced below, because the resident communities are particularly amenable to experimentation. One dogma of intertidal ecology‚Äîsupported by such classic studies‚Äîis that species' lower tide height limits are set by species interactions whereas their upper limits are set by climate variables. Classic studies by Robert Paine established that when sea star predators are removed, mussel beds extend to lower tide heights, smothering resident seaweeds. Thus, mussels' lower limits are set by sea star predation. Conversely, in the presence of sea stars, mussels' lower limits occur at a tide height at which sea stars are unable to tolerate climate conditions. Competition, especially for space, is another dominant interaction structuring intertidal communities. Space competition is especially fierce in rocky intertidal habitats, where habitable space is limited compared to soft- sediment habitats in which three-dimensional space is available. As seen with the previous sea star example, mussels are competitively dominant when they are not kept in check by sea star predation. Joseph Connell's research on two types of high intertidal barnacles, Balanus balanoides, now Semibalanus balanoides, and a Chthamalus stellatus, showed that zonation patterns could also be set by competition between closely related organisms. In this example, Balanus outcompetes Chthamalus at lower tide heights but is unable to survive at higher tide heights. Thus, Balanus conforms to the intertidal ecology dogma introduced above: its lower tide height limit is set by a predatory snail and its higher tide height limit is set by climate. Similarly, Chthamalus, which occurs in a refuge from competition (similar to the temperature refuges discussed above), has a lower tide height limit set by competition with Balanus and a higher tide height limit is set by climate. left Although intertidal ecology has traditionally focused on these negative interactions (predation and competition), there is emerging evidence that positive interactions are also important. Facilitation refers to one organism helping another without harming itself. For example, salt marsh plant species of Juncus and Iva are unable to tolerate the high soil salinities when evaporation rates are high, thus they depend on neighboring plants to shade the sediment, slow evaporation, and help maintain tolerable salinity levels. In similar examples, many intertidal organisms provide physical structures that are used as refuges by other organisms. Mussels, although they are tough competitors with certain species, are also good facilitators as mussel beds provide a three-dimensional habitat to species of snails, worms, and crustaceans. All of the examples given so far are of direct interactions: Species A eat Species B or Species B eats Species C. Also important are indirect interactions where, using the previous example, Species A eats so much of Species B that predation on Species C decreases and Species C increases in number. Thus, Species A indirectly benefits Species C. Pathways of indirect interactions can include all other forms of species interactions. To follow the sea star-mussel relationship, sea stars have an indirect negative effect on the diverse community that lives in the mussel bed because, by preying on mussels and decreasing mussel bed structure, those species that are facilitated by mussels are left homeless. Additional important species interactions include mutualism, which is seen in symbioses between sea anemones and their internal symbiotic algae, and parasitism, which is prevalent but is only beginning to be appreciated for its effects on community structure. Current topics Humans are highly dependent on intertidal habitats for food and raw materials, and over 50% of humans live within 100 km of the coast. Therefore, intertidal habitats are greatly influenced by human impacts to both ocean and land habitats. Some of the conservation issues associated with intertidal habitats and at the head of the agendas of managers and intertidal ecologists are: 1. Climate change: Intertidal species are challenged by several of the effects of global climate change, including increased temperatures, sea level rise, and increased storminess. Ultimately, it has been predicted that the distributions and numbers of species will shift depending on their abilities to adapt (quickly!) to these new environmental conditions. Due to the global scale of this issue, scientists are mainly working to understand and predict possible changes to intertidal habitats. 2. Invasive species: Invasive species are especially prevalent in intertidal areas with high volumes of shipping traffic, such as large estuaries, because of the transport of non-native species in ballast water. San Francisco Bay, in which an invasive Spartina cordgrass from the east coast is currently transforming mudflat communities into Spartina meadows, is among the most invaded estuaries in the world. Conservation efforts are focused on trying to eradicate some species (like Spartina) in their non-native habitats as well as preventing further species introductions (e.g. by controlling methods of ballast water uptake and release). 3. Marine protected areas: Many intertidal areas are lightly to heavily exploited by humans for food gathering (e.g. clam digging in soft-sediment habitats and snail, mussel, and algal collecting in rocky intertidal habitats). In some locations, marine protected areas have been established where no collecting is permitted. The benefits of protected areas may spill over to positively impact adjacent unprotected areas. For example, a greater number of larger egg capsules of the edible snail Concholepus in protected vs. non-protected areas in Chile indicates that these protected areas may help replenish snail stocks in areas open to harvesting. The degree to which collecting is regulated by law differs with the species and habitat.

Earlier career Born in 1950 in Buckinghamshire, England. Education: Downside School, Somerset (five A Levels); Corpus Christi College, University of Cambridge (M.A.); Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University. Peter joined the British Diplomatic Service in 1973, having graduated from the University of Cambridge with a degree in Classical Philosophy, and having spent two years at the Harvard Graduate School for Arts and Sciences as a Harkness Fellow. His 33-year diplomatic career took him to Vienna (twice), Washington, D.C., Paris, Bras√≠lia and Geneva. In Washington he was Private Secretary to two Ambassadors during an eventful period in transatlantic and East/West relations, as well as the Falklands War (1982‚Äì84). During three spells in the FCO prior to 1987 he had responsibility for aspects of the Irish question, relations with Brazil and the Andean countries, and Diplomatic Service assignments below the grade of Counsellor. In Paris he dealt with issues arising from the creation of a European single market and worked on Franco-British energy ties. After a spell in Brasilia, where he contributed to strengthening Anglo-Brazilian political and economic relations, as Brazil began its recovery from two decades of hyperinflation (1992‚Äì95), he became the UK's chief representative to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. There he lobbied for a further round of global trade relations, participated in trade policy reviews, chaired the WTO's Balance of Payments Committee, and helped to set up the Advisory Centre on WTO Law. Ambassador to IAEA and on to mediation In 2001 he was made Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency and other UN organisations at Vienna. There his primary focus was on the nuclear aspects of international peace and security, especially the Iranian nuclear issue, at a point when the nuclear talks between Iran and the European Union appeared to hold promise, but were stymied by elements within the Bush Administration. On leaving the Diplomatic Service in 2006 he worked as a special representative for the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership in Vienna, and as an adviser to the director of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, a global public policy research institute, before qualifying as a civil and commercial mediator. Since 2010 he has been a partner in The Ambassador Partnership LLP, a cross-border dispute settlement and problem- solving partnership. He writes and speaks on international nuclear and trade policy issues. He is an associate director of EcoEnergen. From 2010 to 2012 he was an associate fellow of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy. Negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme Peter is a frequent contributor, on the Iranian nuclear question, to LobeLog. He has been active within the international movement supporting negotiations with Iran and seeking diplomatic solutions that respect Iran's rights to a civil nuclear power industry but that also restrain it from achieving a nuclear weapon capability. In an article in the Telegraph in 2012 he expressed concern that imposing ever tighter sanctions on Iran required an exaggeration of the Iranian nuclear threat which fuelled the scare-mongering of those who wanted sanctions to be a mere step on the way to war. He argued that sanctions were a disproportionate response to a state acting on its right to enrich uranium and that Iran's uranium enrichment programme should be handled in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). He lamented that far too many American politicians saw advantage in whipping up fear of Iran and would sneer that the NPT was for wimps.The deal the West could strike with Iran, The Telegraph 23 January 2012 In September 2013 he co-authored an article in the Christian Science Monitor with Robert Hunter, US ambassador to NATO in the mid-90s. They argued that the election of Dr Hassan Rouhani as president of Iran presented an opportunity for the West to review its position in the nuclear negotiations with Iran that had got under way in April 2012. Instead of requiring Iran to dismantle its uranium enrichment programme (as demanded by Israel) or reduce the number of centrifuges at its disposal to a few thousand, the West should ask Iran to volunteer confidence-building demonstrations of peaceful intent during a transition to full enjoyment of its right to make peaceful use of nuclear technologies. The West should also focus its efforts on influencing Iranian cost/benefit calculations, as recommended in US national intelligence estimates, and build on Iran's interest in preserving the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Accusation during a debate on Iran In 2012, during a debate at Warwick University, Peter Jenkins was accused of anti-semitism for stating that it seemed that Jews and Christians no longer shared the idea that a just war requires the use of force to be proportionate. In the debate, Jenkins, opposed by representatives of the Foundation for the Defence of Democracy and the Henry Jackson Society, spoke successfully in proposition to the motion \\"this house would rather a nuclear armed Iran than war\\",http://www.warwickdebatingsociety.co.uk/?page_id=723 explaining that diplomacy could avert both war and Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. The Chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews subsequently opined that \\"he clearly sees Jews as having different moral compass that is irreconcilable with the Christian West. This is grossly offensive and palpable nonsense\\".http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish- News/Ex-UK-diplomat-Proportional-warfare-is-not-Jewish In a letter to the editor of the Jewish Chronicle, Jenkins clarified that in speaking about the concept of a just war he intended to draw attention to acts perpetrated by the state of Israel, and that he felt no hostility toward the Jewish people.

Sometimes he also incorporated an inflatable bladder that helped him simulate breathing.  Early life  Delgado's family moved to California in 1910, running away from the Mexican Revolution. He first started sculpting at age 6. As his family was very poor, Delgado worked most of the time, leaving school behind. He did not learn English until he was 17, a fact that more often than not made his getting a job difficult. In 1921 he split his time working in a convenience store and taking art lessons at the Otis Art Institute (now called Otis College of Art and Design), where he also got a part-time job to pay for his lessons.  Career  King Kong (1933) poster While he worked in the Institute he met Willis O'Brien, who worked in special effects for movies in Hollywood. O'Brien was a specialist in building miniature creatures and sets as well as in stop-motion animation. Impressed by Delgado's work, he tried to lure him away to work with him on several occasions, offering four times more than the salary Delgado was making at the time. The answer was always the same, \\"I don't wanna work in the movies. I want to be an artist\\". When O'Brien was about to tackle the biggest challenge in his career, The Lost World, he decided to make one last attempt to gain the services of the young Mexican sculptor. He invited him to spend a day in the First National studio where he was working. He walked Delgado through the whole place and then took him to the workshop where he did the all the miniatures' work. \\"Welcome to your studio\\", he said, and eventually that became true. Delgado accepted the offer to work with O'Brien just to be able to work in such a place. Years later Delgado said the work area \\"was a clean, vast and organized place with cameras, lights, and all kind of materials. It was any artist's dream\\". Delgado and O'Brien worked together for many years and soon became one of the most respected special effects crews in Hollywood. Their most famous and groundbreaking collaboration was the original King Kong, released in 1933. They refined these techniques in 1949's Mighty Joe Young, which garnered an Academy Award for special effects (awarded to O'Brien).Oscars.org - \\"The 22nd Academy Awards (1950)\\" Delgado retired in 1965 and died on November 26, 1976 in Los Angeles, California.  Films  O'Brien and Delgado's first work together was in The Lost World, but they became famous a few years later with King Kong (1933). Kong's success was followed by a failed sequel, Son of Kong. They also worked on movies like The Last Days of Pompeii (1935) and others. * The Perils of Pauline (1967) - gorilla costume creator (uncredited)Hollywood Gorilla Men: Perilous Primate Hijinx ! * Fantastic Voyage (1966) - miniatures (uncredited) * Mary Poppins (1964) - special effects props (uncredited) * Dinosaurus!

He played five seasons for the Chicago Bears (1932‚Äì1936), three for the Philadelphia Eagles (1937‚Äì1939), and one for the Phil-Pitt Steagles (1943). He is remembered for his refusal to wear a helmet as one of the last NFL players not to wear one.Lyons, 2010, p. 70. Hewitt played college football for the Michigan Wolverines, where he was named team's most valuable player and first-team All-Big Ten his senior season. In nine NFL seasons, he was named an All-Pro six times, won two NFL championships, and in 1934 led the league in touchdown receptions. His jersey number 56 is retired by the Bears and he is a member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame. Hewitt was posthumously inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. Early life and college Hewitt was born in Bay City, Michigan and attended Bay City Central High School. He attended the University of Michigan, where he lettered for three seasons for the Michigan Wolverines football team. He started in two games each in 1929 and 1930, and in 1931 was a first-team All-Big Ten selection from the United Press, as well as the Wolverines' team MVP. That season, he started four games at left end and five games at fullback, and had 446 yards rushing on 118 attempts. Against Minnesota, he scored the only touchdown of the game on a 57-yard run to help Michigan secure that year's Little Brown Jug trophy with a 6‚Äì0 win. Professional career His head coach in Chicago, George Halas, called Hewitt \\"absolutely fearless. He was a happy- go-lucky guy‚Äîuntil he stepped onto the field‚Äîand then he was a terror on offense or defense. He asked no quarter nor gave any.\\" For most of his career, Hewitt refused to wear a helmet during games, reasoning that wearing one inhibited his play. He played without one until 1939, his final season with the Eagles, due to new league rules requiring players to wear a helmet. On defense, Hewitt was known for his quick reaction to the snap, which led fans to refer to him as \\"The Offside Kid.\\" \\"I just anticipate when the ball is going to be snapped and charge at the same time\\", explained Hewitt. \\"Anyway, what is the head linesman for? It's up to him to call offside if he thinks I am.\\" =Chicago Bears= Hewitt played for the Chicago Bears for five seasons, from 1932 to 1936. As a rookie, he played in the 1932 NFL Playoff Game for the Bears against the Portsmouth Spartans, which was held to break a tie that season for the NFL championship. The Bears defeated the Spartans 9‚Äì0. The next season the Bears played in the first ever NFL Championship Game, against the New York Giants. Hewitt had only one reception for three yards in the game, but was a part of what was described as \\"the greatest play of the game.\\" In the fourth quarter, with the Bears trailing by five, Hewitt received a pass from Bears quarterback Keith Molesworth, before lateraling to end Bill Karr, who then ran 19 yards for the final touchdown of the game. The Bears won the game 23‚Äì21. Hewitt led the league in receiving touchdowns in 1934, with five, and was named a first-team All-NFL selection for the third time in as many years. In 1935 Hewitt caught five passes and was without a touchdown for the first time in his career. He had his most productive season as a pro in both receiving yards and touchdowns in 1936, as he caught 15 passes for 358 yards and six touchdowns. =Philadelphia Eagles= After considering retirement, Hewitt was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles with $4,000 in cash from the Bears in exchange for the rights to the first overall selection in the 1937 NFL Draft, Sam Francis, on February 15, 1937. Hewitt's game salary increased from $100 per game to $200 per game following the trade. He played for the Eagles for three seasons from 1937 to 1939. He was named to the All-NFL team in 1937, becoming the first player in league history to be named an All-Pro for two different teams. He had his second All-NFL selection as an Eagle in 1938 after catching a career-high 18 passes on the season. In November 1939, Eagles president Bert Bell announced Hewitt would be retiring at the end of the season after eight years in the NFL. In his final home game with the Eagles, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he was the middle man of a 66-yard play as he received a 26-yard pass from Davey O'Brien and lateraled to Jay Arnold, who ran 40 yards for the touchdown. They won 17 to 14‚Äîtheir first and only win that season. =Steagles and retirement= After being out of football for three seasons, Hewitt returned in 1943 to play fullback for the Steagles, a temporary merger of the Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers during World War II. He appeared in six games that season, started in four of them, and caught two passes for 22 yards, after which he retired for good. During his career he caught 103 passes for 1,638 yards and 23 touchdowns. He also had one rushing touchdown and three passing touchdowns. He was named an All-Pro by at least one major U.S. publication six times in his career. After football After retiring from professional football in 1943, Hewitt worked for Supplee-Wills-Jones, a milk company, until September 1946. He died in a car crash on January 14, 1947 in Sellersville, Pennsylvania. Hewitt was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. With his induction, the Bears became the first NFL team to have a complete one-platoon lineup in the Hall of Fame. In 2008 Hewitt was named to the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. He is a member of the National Football League 1930s All-Decade Team, selected in 1969 by the Hall of Fame. Hewitt's jersey number 56 is retired by the Bears, and he is enshrined in the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame. References Sources * Lyons, Robert S. (2010). On Any Given Sunday, A Life of Bert Bell.

Hammonds was an outfielder and played for the Baltimore Orioles (1993‚Äì1998), Cincinnati Reds (1998‚Äì1999), Colorado Rockies (2000), Milwaukee Brewers (2001‚Äì2003), San Francisco Giants (2003‚Äì2004) and the Washington Nationals (2005) in Major League Baseball (MLB). Before playing professionally, Hammonds played for Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey and Stanford University. At Stanford, Hammonds was named an All-American. The Orioles selected Hammonds with the fourth overall selection of the 1992 MLB Draft. Though he was seen as one of the best prospects in baseball, injuries limited his performance with Baltimore. After he was traded to Cincinnati and then to Colorado, he emerged with the Rockies in 2000, and was selected to appear at the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He signed a three-year, $21.75 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers that off-season, but continued to struggle with injuries. He had a resurgence with the Giants in 2003, after he was released by the Brewers, but struggled with the Giants in 2004 and Nationals in 2005 before retiring. Amateur career Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, Hammonds grew up in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, He attended Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, where he played for the school's baseball team. After high school, Hammonds was a ninth-round draft pick of the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft, though he did not sign. He reported that he never considered going professional at that point, as his parents insisted he attend college, and that Hammonds' brother, who had signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates out of high school, suffered a career-ending injury while playing in minor league baseball. Hammonds had scholarship offers to attend Duke University, the University of Notre Dame, and Stanford University and play college baseball. He chose to attend Stanford University, where he played for the Stanford Cardinal baseball team that competed in the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I. At Stanford, Hammonds broke the Pac-10 single season stolen base record as a freshman, stealing 102 bases in 174 career games. Hammonds was awarded NCAA Freshman of the Year and voted All-College World Series in 1990 and was also named an All- American in that year. During the 1992 season, Hammonds batted .380 with 33 stolen bases in 47 games, and was again named an All-American. He again led the Cardinal to the 1992 College World Series. Professional career =Draft= Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds indicated that he would sign if offered a $1.8 million signing bonus, which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million. Hammonds did not play professionally in 1992 as he competed for the United States national baseball team in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. He faced a two-month road trip across sixteen states by bus, more travel combined with training than employed by any professional team. Hammonds struggled with the national team initially, but agreed to sign with the Orioles in July 1992, receiving a $975,000 signing bonus, the largest of any player chosen in that draft. Upon signing, his hitting improved. =Top prospect: Baltimore Orioles (1992‚Äì1996)= Without having played a single professional game, Baseball America rated Hammonds as the 19th best prospect in baseball. He made his professional debut in 1993 with the Bowie Baysox of the Class-AA Eastern League, where he batted .283, at which point he was promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the Class-AAA International League, where he batted .311. Hammonds received a promotion to the Orioles on June 25, becoming the first player chosen in the 1992 MLB draft to reach the majors, where his debut was greeted with fanfare and high expectations. He batted .305 in 105 at-bats with the Orioles that season, however he suffered a pinched nerve in May, and a neck injury in August. The Orioles ended his season prematurely to allow Hammonds to recover. Thought of as a potential candidate for the American League Rookie of the Year Award, at this point Baseball America rated Hammonds the third best prospect in all of baseball. Hammonds suffered a knee injury during the 1994 season but opted to continue playing despite being told he needed reconstructive knee surgery, with his subsequent performances limited as a result. When the Orioles needed to reduce their roster from 28 players to 25 in May 1995, Hammonds, who started the season batting 4-for-19, was optioned back to Bowie. After struggling with the Orioles early in the 1996 season, batting .237 in 56 games, he was demoted back to Rochester in June. The Orioles included Hammonds in numerous trade proposals that summer, but eventually held on to him. During his spell with Rochester Hammonds became more selective in his approach at the plate, and was recalled to the Orioles. Hammonds injured his knee in August and though he returned to the Orioles in September, they left him off their postseason roster, as they asserted that they felt Hammonds was rusty. Hammonds believed that the snub meant he should be traded, but stopped short of demanding a trade. =Searching for success: Baltimore Orioles and Cincinnati Reds (1997‚Äì1999)= Formerly considered a top prospect in the Orioles organization, Hammonds returned to them in 1997 with his role in the organization unclear. In past spring trainings Hammonds had always practiced with the starters; in 1997, the Orioles alternated him between the starters, who practiced in the stadium, and the minor leaguers and non-roster players, who practiced in fields behind the stadium near an airport runway. New GM Pat Gillick didn't deny that the Orioles could trade him if Hammonds didn't maximize his talent, though he called a potential trade a \\"last resort\\". Despite this Hammonds had a successful season, playing in 118 games that season, receiving 397 at-bats. He scored 71 runs, had 105 hits, including 19 doubles, three triples, and 21 home runs, and recorded 55 RBI. By 1998, Hammonds and the Orioles were hoping he would achieve more consistency. With the threat of facing a salary arbitration hearing, the Orioles approached him with the idea of working out an agreement on a multi-year contract extension. Hammonds agreed, and signed a three-year, $7 million contract before the 1998 season. Hammonds felt that this was a strong commitment from the Orioles hierarchy, including Gillick, after which manager Ray Miller believed that this would allow Hammonds to focus on improving his skills. However, Hammonds suffered a back injury that returned him to the disabled list that year. When Hammonds recovered, the Orioles traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for Willie Greene in August 1998. Hammonds originally was designated to serve as a backup outfielder for the Reds going into the 1999. In the May 19 contest versus the Colorado Rockies, Cincinnati won by a score of 24‚àí12, tied for the fourth-highest run-scoring output in MLB history. Hammonds hit three home runs in this game; the Reds totaled six. He batted .279 with 17 home runs and 41 RBIs in 123 games during the 1999 season. After the season, the Reds traded Hammonds with Stan Belinda to the Colorado Rockies for Dante Bichette and $1.9 million to make up for the differences in salaries, as the Reds believed the slugging Bichette could aid them in replacing Greg Vaughn. =All-Star season and multiyear contract: Colorado Rockies, Milwaukee Brewers (2000‚Äì2003)= In 2000 with the Colorado Rockies, Hammonds batted .335 with 20 home runs, 106 RBI, 14 stolen bases, in only 454 at bats. For his performance, he earned a spot on the 2000 National League All-Star team roster. He trailed only teammate Todd Helton in batting average for the majority of the season, eventually finishing with the fourth-highest batting average in the league, behind Helton, Mois√©s Alou, and Vladimir Guerrero. After the season, the Rockies declined to offer Hammonds salary arbitration, making him a free agent. Due to concerns about Hammonds' injury history, including 40 games missed due to injury in the 2000 season, the Rockies chose not to meet Hammonds' financial demands. Before the 2001 season, the Milwaukee Brewers signed Hammonds to a three-year, $21.75 million contract, the largest contract the organization had approved to that date. However, injuries prevented Hammonds from approaching the All-Star form he had shown with the Rockies. He suffered a shoulder injury in 2001 which required surgery and this limited him to 49 games played for the season. He returned with a hot start in the 2002 season, batting .324 as of June 5, but he had a recurrence of the shoulder injury later in the season that returned him to the disabled list yet again. Hammonds then began the 2003 season on the disabled list, this time with a high ankle sprain. =Struggles, resurgence, and injuries: San Francisco Giants and Washington Nationals (2003‚Äì2005)= The Brewers released Hammonds on June 4, 2003 after he struggled in ten games, batting .158. He signed with the San Francisco Giants at the end of June. They initially assigned him to the Class-AAA Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League, before promoting him on July 30. He batted .277 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in 36 games during the second half of the 2003 season, and was selected for the Giants' postseason roster over Marvin Benard and Eric Young where he batted 2-for-4 in Game 4 of the 2003 National League Division Series. Granted free agency at the end of the season, he re-signed with the Giants for the 2004 season for $1 million, as the replacement for Jose Cruz Jr., who had left after becoming a free agent. However, Hammonds was unable to sustain his improved performance and the Giants released Hammonds that June, after he batted .211 with three home runs and six RBIs. Hammonds then signed with the Washington Nationals organization on a minor league contract. He started the 2005 season with the New Orleans Zephyrs of the PCL, but was recalled to the Nationals on May 3. He batted .219 with one RBI in thirteen games for the Nationals, before returning to the disabled list with an injured hamstring on May 22. While rehabilitating the injury, Hammonds decided to retire rather than return to the minor leagues. Though Hammonds had great natural talent, his injuries limited his career. Hammonds announced his retirement on June 10, 2005. In his thirteen-year career in MLB, he batted .272, 110 home runs, 824 hits, and 423 RBIs. Personal life Hammonds lives in Weston, Florida with his three children. He is currently a scout for the San Diego Padres. He has interest in digital media, aiding baseball prospects, and working for the Major League Baseball Players Association. On February 6, 2014, Hammonds was hired by the players' union as special assistant for player program development. Hammonds' older brother, Reginald, played minor league baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization, reaching Class-AAA before suffering a career-ending injury. He enrolled at Northwestern University, graduated, became a stockbroker and aided Hammonds in his 1992 contract negotiations.

Socioeconomic Impact  The concept of Open Access to Communication Resources is central in the ongoing transformation of the communication market from a \\"vertically integrated\\" market with a few operators owning and operating everything between the physical medium and the end-user, to an \\"open horizontal market\\" with an abundance of actors operating on different levels and providing value added services on top of each other. Open Access is also a broad approach to policy and regulatory issues that starts from the question: what do we want to bring about outside of purely industry sector concerns? It places an emphasis on: empowering citizens, getting the best from public and private sector contributions and encouraging local innovation, economic growth and investment. It is not simply about making micro-adjustments to the technical rules of the policy and regulatory framework but seeking to produce fundamental changes in the outcomes that can be delivered through it. Since the advent of World Wide Web (WWW) in the early 1990s, the greatest advantage the web culture has brought about through dot- com boom-and-bust cycles is decentralization that has created more user- centric society, embracing diversity, practicality, voluntarism and egalitarianism in every field across the planet.

He is perhaps best known as the creator of King Aroo, a comic strip often compared to Walt Kelly's Pogo. In addition to his own books, he also illustrated 22 books by other authors.Streetman, Burgin. \\"Just Only Jack,\\" San Antonio Current, February 10, 2010. Born in Burlington, Iowa, Kent dropped out of high school at the age of 15 and began a career as a freelance commercial artist, working in that field until he joined the U.S. Army in 1941. King Aroo arrives His first nationally recognized work was King Aroo, which was syndicated and distributed internationally from November 1950 to June 1965. The strip did not become a great commercial success, but was reportedly adored by its loyal fanbase, and praised for its imaginative puns and dialogue.http://www.newsarama.com/4870-idw-adds-king-aroo-to-its-library-of- american-comics.html The early strips were collected in a 192-page book, King Aroo, published as a trade paperback by Doubleday in 1953. The collection had an introduction by Gilbert Seldes. In 2010 IDW began a complete reprint of King Aroo, with the first volume covering dailies and Sundays from 1950 thru 1952. He also wrote and drew the seasonal 1968 syndicated Christmas comic strip, Why Christmas Almost Wasn't which was also offered to Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) clients.Santa's Secrets, Day 5 Also in 1968, and continuing into 1969, he wrote several articles (and illustrated one of them) for Mad. He made a final contribution to Mad in 1977.https://www.sacurrent.com/sanantonio/just-only- jack/Content?oid=2292614http://madcoversite.com/ugoi-jack_kent.html He began writing and illustrating children's books in 1968, which he continued doing until his death. Personal life According to Bruce Canwell's biographical essay published in IDW's second volume of King Aroo-reprints, Kent married Juliet Bridgman in September 1952; however, the couple divorced only eight months later. In March 1954, Kent married again, this time to June Kilstofte, a reporter who had interviewed him for a magazine article. They remained married until Kent's death. In July, 1955 their only child John Wellington \\"Jack\\" Kent Jr. was born. Living on the banks of the San Antonio River, Kent and his wife June named their home King Aroo's Castle. He died in 1985 from leukemia. Awards Jack Kent's book Just Only John received awards from the Chicago Graphics Associates and the Children's Book Clinic. The New York Times named his Mr. Meebles outstanding picture book of the year 1970. Archives At the University of Minnesota, the collection Jack Kent Papers spans the years 1953 to 1985 and includes 50 pencil sketches, nine photocopies, 182 blue line illustrations, 251 ink illustrations (some with holograph, paste-ups, separations), two paste-ups for table of contents, eight pencil illustrations with holograph, three ink illustrations with color indications and three watercolor illustrations.

It was the second film in SuperCinecolor, a three-color version of the two-color process Cinecolor. Plot On their way to their jobs at the Death's Head Tavern, Oliver \\"Puddin' Head\\" Johnson (Lou Costello) and Rocky Stonebridge (Bud Abbott) encounter Lady Jane (Fran Warren), who asks them to bring a love note to the tavern singer, Bruce Martingale (Bill Shirley). At the tavern, the notorious Captain Kidd (Charles Laughton) dines with Captain Anne Bonney (Hillary Brooke), a female pirate. She complains that Kidd raided ships in her territory and demands her share of the treasure. Kidd informs Bonney that he has hidden the amassed treasure on Skull Island, and that he has the only map to its exact location. He agrees to take her, with her ship following close behind in the event of a double-cross. But as Oliver nervously waits on them, he inadvertently switches Lady Jane's love note with Kidd's map. Rocky discovers the mistake and negotiates with Kidd to take them along and share the treasure in exchange for the map. Kidd ostensibly agrees, but intends to kill Oliver and Rocky once he gets the map. The voyage begins with the addition of Bruce, who has been shanghaied. Kidd unsuccessfully attempts to regain the map throughout the entire voyage. Meanwhile, Bonney mistakenly believes that Lady Jane's love note was written to Oliver, and becomes intrigued. During the voyage Kidd raids an English ship carrying Lady Jane, and kidnaps her. When the ships reach Skull Island, Oliver and Rocky dig up the treasure. Kidd arrogantly declares his plans to dispose of them along with Captain Bonney. Bonney alerts the others to Kidd's true intentions, and signals her crew to attack. Bonney's crew wins the fight, the treasure is recovered, and Kidd becomes her prisoner.

The Cay Sal Bank is also visible. The Bahama Banks are the submerged carbonate platforms that make up much of the Bahama Archipelago. The term is usually applied in referring to either the Great Bahama Bank around Andros Island, or the Little Bahama Bank of Grand Bahama Island and Great Abaco, which are the largest of the platforms, and the Cay Sal Bank north of Cuba. The islands of these banks are politically part of the Bahamas. Other banks are the three banks of the Turks and Caicos Islands, namely the Caicos Bank of the Caicos Islands, the bank of the Turks Islands, and wholly submerged Mouchoir Bank. Further southeast are the equally wholly submerged Silver Bank and Navidad Bank north of the Dominican Republic. Geologic history and structure The limestone that comprises the Banks has been accumulating since at least the Cretaceous period, and perhaps as early as the Jurassic; today the total thickness under the Great Bahama Bank is over 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles).http://geoinfo.amu.edu.pl/wpk/geos/GEO_6/GEO_PLATE_C-16.HTML \\"Geomorphology from Space, Chapter 6: Coastal Landforms. Plate C-16, 'Great Bahama Bank'\\" (Accessed 3/9/06) As the limestone was deposited in shallow water, the only way to explain this massive column is to estimate that the entire platform has subsided under its own weight at a rate of roughly 3.6 centimetres (2 inches) per 1,000 years. The waters of the Bahama Banks are very shallow; on the Great Bahama Bank they are generally no deeper than 25 meters (80 feet).Stephen K. Boss, \\"Geological Research on the Great Bahama Bank\\" (Accessed 3/9/06) The slopes around them however, such as the border of the Tongue of the Ocean in the Great Bahama Bank, are very steep. The Banks were dry land during past ice ages, when sea level was as much as 120 meters (390 feet) lower than at present; the area of the Bahamas today thus represents only a small fraction of their prehistoric extent. When they were exposed to the atmosphere, the limestone structure was subjected to chemical weathering that created the caves and sinkholes common to karst terrain, resulting in structures like blue holes.

In the early hours of January 14th 1993 it capsized and sank in 27 metres of water off Cape Arcona on the coast of R√ºgen in the Baltic Sea while sailing toward Ystad with 64 passengers and crew.Rzeczpospolita article from 2008-12-01 The accident claimed the lives of 20 crewmen and 35 passengers. 10 bodies were never found. Nine people were rescued. The sinking of Jan Heweliusz is the most deadly peacetime maritime disaster involving a Polish ship.  1986 fire  In September 1986, the ship suffered a serious fire. No one on board was injured, but the ship was heavily damaged. The ship was repaired by coating the damaged areas with 60 tons of concrete, which increased the weight of the ship and dangerously affected its stability; this was apparently an illegal method.

It capsized at 5:12am. The waves were up to 6 metres high and ferries in the nearby port of Sassnitz had been cancelled. Prior to its sinking, Jan Heweliusz had been involved in 28 incidents, including collisions with fishing boats, listing, engine failure, and a fire in 1986. It had ballast problems and had also damaged its hull in Ystad during docking, but this was not reported to the port authorities and only makeshift repairs were made. It sailed two hours late, carrying 10 railway carriages from five European countries. The Marine Chamber of Appeals in Gdynia blamed the accident on the poor technical condition of the ship, with the captain, who died in the accident, also being blamed for allowing the ship to sail in such an unseaworthy state. In 2005, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasburg ruled that the official investigation of the sinking was not impartial and granted 4600 euros in damages each to eleven relatives of the victims. Today, the wreck of the ship is located at the depth of 27 metres and is frequently visited by divers.

In the 1930s Peterhans was a proponent of the Neues Sehen (New Vision) movement, taking close-up, still-life photographs of everyday objects and images that played with unusual angles and lighting. At the Bauhaus, Peterhans' teaching involved using the theories of Kant, Plato and Pythagoras to show how beauty is constructed in the mind, and how it can be created in works of art.

Environmental dumping is the practice of transfrontier shipment of waste (household waste, industrial/nuclear waste, etc.) from one country to another. The goal is to take the waste to a country that has less strict environmental laws, or environmental laws that are not strictly enforced. The economic benefit of this practice is cheap disposal or recycling of waste without the economic regulations of the original country. An example of an attempt at environmental dumping is the story of the decommissioned French aircraft carrier, the FS Clemenceau, which was originally sold to a ship-breaking yard in Gujarat India to be demolished and recycled as scrap. The Indian Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that it could not enter Indian waters due to the high level of toxic waste and 700 tons of asbestos present on the ship, forcing the French government to take the Clemenceau back. The ship was subsequently blocked from entering the Suez Canal for the same reason. In 2009, the task of recycling the vessel was ultimately taken over by specialist recyclers at Hartlepool in the United Kingdom. Environmental dumping The shipment of waste between countries has been referred to as ‚Äútransfrontier shipment‚Äù of waste. Transfrontier waste is shipped within the European Union (EU) and between the European Union and other countries. Most of this waste is traded by Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) countries. The waste is typically non- hazardous and includes metals, plastics, and paper products. In 2007, it is estimated that OECD countries exported between 4 and 5 million tons of metal and paper waste. OECD countries also exported near a half of million tons of recovered plastics in 2007. Some of these wastes that are transported can be hazardous waste. These hazardous wastes can cause potential health risks to humans and the environment. According to the Basel Convention, there is at least 8 million tons of hazardous waste imported and exported every year.\\"The Basel Convention At A Glance.\\" basel.int 11 Feb. 2009 The Basel Convention was created in 1989 but started enforcing rules in 1992. The purpose of the Convention is to control the hazardous waste that was imported and exported throughout the EU. The Convention is a great contributor to stopping the shipment of illegal waste. In May 2005, 60 containers were seized that were on their way from the United Kingdom to China. The containers seized by Dutch authorities were supposed to be for paper but actually contained household wastes. Since neither the UK, China, nor Dutch had agreed to the importation of the wastes, the waste was shipped back. The Basel Convention also deals with the popular growing issue of E-waste. The Waste Shipment Regulation confirms what can be shipped to, from, and between EU countries. These regulation rules divide the waste into three separate lists: Green List, Amber List, and Red List. * Green List : These items are considered to be non- hazardous and more environmentally friendly. Some of these items may include paper and plastic that can be recycled. These types of shipment don‚Äôt have to receive prior permission to cross international waters and be shipped to parts of the European Union. * Amber List : Materials are considered to be mixed on this list containing both non-hazardous and hazardous parts. These materials can contain metal bearing wastes, organic and inorganic wastes, and/or organic or inorganic constituents. A company or country shipping these items would have to have prior consent before exporting the materials. As of 2007, consent for the shipment of waste is received by Dublin City Council. * Red List : This includes reasonably hazardous materials. These materials contain principally organic or inorganic constituents, which include polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs). Ocean dumping Shipment of waste from country to country can also involve dumping waste into the ocean. Ocean dumping has been a problem since the 19th century. It was legal to dump industrial waste into the ocean until the Ocean Dumping Act was passed in 1972. During the years of 1970 and 1980 alone, it was estimated that 25 million tons of waste including scrap metal, chemicals, and acids were dumped into the ocean. Ocean dumping can lead to eutrophication which depletes the oxygen from the water, in turn killing marine life. Ocean dumping is placed into three lists: Gray List, Black List, and White List. *Gray List: Water is highly contaminated and toxic on the gray list. Some of the contaminants include arsenic, lead, acids, nickel, chromium, scrap metals, and radioactive materials. *Black List: The materials listed on the black list include mercury, cadmium, plastic, oil products, radioactive waste, and anything that is solely made for biological and chemical warfare. The materials on this list are highly potent and hazardous. *White List: The white list contains every other material not already mentioned in the above lists. This list is used to make sure nothing will be dumped into the ocean and disturb or damage the coral reef ecosystems. The most recent example of hazardous waste being dumped into the ocean occurred along C√¥te d'Ivoire in Africa in 2006. Hundreds of tons of waste product were dumped into the ocean from a ship by the name of Probo Koala.\\"Two jailed for dumping toxic waste in Ivory Coast.\\" Nrc./nl/international. 23 Oct. 2008.

Web. 6 Feb. 2009 The owner of the local company that was responsible for disposing the chemicals in various places was given 20 years in jail. In the European Union, new regulations on the shipment of hazardous and non-hazardous materials were implemented in 2007. According to the new regulations, the EU will no longer be able to export their hazardous wastes to developing countries that do not have the capabilities to deal with the waste in an environmentally friendly way. E-waste, such as computers, cannot be shipped to countries that are not in the EU or the European Free Trade Association. States and countries that are members of the EU or EFTA must conduct inspections periodically to make sure that all regulations are being followed and physically check containers to verify that the containers hold only what is authorized. Finally, if the country that is taking the waste is unable to accept or dispose of the waste then the sender must pay to take their waste back. Ship dismantling Ship dismantling is another form of trans frontier waste that is shipped from country to country. Many ships are broken down into parts that can be recycled. Many parts of the ships are hazardous and can potentially pollute the areas that they are broken down in. The ship parts can contain asbestos, PCB's, and oil sludge. All of these components can be a potential health risk and harm the environment. Most ship scrapping industries are in developing countries where the laws (environmentally as well as occupationally) are not as strict as in developed countries. International Maritime Organization states that India is the leader in ship dismantling, followed by China, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The aircraft carrier Clemenceau was denied access to Indian waters because it contained asbestos. The French aircraft was carried from France to Britain to be recycled on February 8, 2009 despite the abundance of asbestos. The EU Commission proposed improvements to be made to improve the ship dismantling as well as the ocean dumping process on November 19, 2008. Public consultations were held in 2009, and stakeholder workshops were organized between 2009 and 2011. On March 26, 2009, the EU Parliament adopted a resolution on the Communication that was adopted by the Commission on October 21, 2009. The European Council‚Äôs Conclusions endorse the Hong Kong Convention on environmentally responsible ship recycling, adopted in May 2009. According to the International Maritime Organization, he Hong Kong Convention ‚Äúintends to address all the issues around ship recycling, including the fact that ships sold for scrapping may contain environmentally hazardous substances such as asbestos, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, ozone-depleting substances and others. It also addresses concerns raised about the working and environmental conditions at many of the world's ship recycling locations.‚Äù recycling is very important when it comes to recycling devices  See also  * Environmental racism * Toxic colonialism * Global waste trade * NIMBY * Pollution haven hypothesis * Environmental protection * Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.

He was a son of the founding emperor Murong Chui (Emperor Wucheng) and a brother of Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin). Throughout most of the state's history, he was admired by the people and officials alike for his military and governance abilities, but his inexplicable failures in 398 helped to lead to the downfall of himself, his brother Murong Bao, and the Later Yan state. Before Later Yan's founding The first reference to Murong Nong in history was in 369, when Murong Chui, then a Former Yan prince, fled to Former Qin after he came after suspicion of the emperor Murong Wei's mother Empress Dowager Kezuhun and the regent Murong Ping; Murong Nong was one of his sons who fled with him. He was mentioned as having told his father in 377 that, in light of the capable prime minister Wang Meng's death, the Former Qin emperor Fu JiƒÅn's reign appeared to be deteriorating and that Murong Chui should consider reestablishing Yan (which had fallen to Former Qin in 370). Murong Chui laughed off his suggestion at this point but kept it in mind. Murong Nong would renew his suggestion in 383 after Former Qin had failed in its attempt to conquer Jin and been severely weakened in the defeat at the Battle of Fei River. Murong Chui agreed this time, and after receiving Fu JiƒÅn's permission to go on a mission to try to pacify the northeastern empire, instead plotted rebellion. As part of the plan, as Murong Chui rose south of the Yellow River near Luoyang, Murong Nong and his cousin Murong Kai (ÊÖïÂÆπÊ•∑) started a rebellion of their own north of the Yellow River in spring 384. He quickly defeated the highly regarded Former Qin general Shi Yue (Áü≥Ë∂ä), and became a major menace for Former Qin troops, and he was known both for his military strategies and strict discipline. During Murong Chui's reign In spring 384, Murong Chui declared the establishment of Later Yan, and Murong Nong continued to contribute greatly to the campaigns that he would wage the next year against Former Qin remnants and other generals who had maintained semi-independence in light of Former Qin's collapse. Around the new year 386, Murong Nong stamped out all remaining Former Qin resistance in the You (ÂπΩÂ∑û, modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei) and Ping (Âπ≥Â∑û, modern Liaoning) Provinces, including the rebel Yu Yan (È§òÂ∑ñ), and further recovered some commanderies that Goguryeo had seized. Murong Chui made him effective viceroy of You and Ping Provinces, in charge of the old Former Yan capital Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning), and he remained in that post for several years, apparently greatly favored by the people of the region. In 386, Murong Chui created him the Prince of Liaoxi. In 389, believing that there were no longer matters for him to attend to in the You/Ping region, Murong Nong submitted a report to Murong Chui requesting a recall to the capital Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±, in modern Baoding, Hebei), stating, in part: :I initially advanced my forces here to suppress rebels, and I was ordered to keep these provinces safe. My soldiers have rested for several years, and there are still many bandits in Qing (ÈùíÂ∑û, modern central and eastern Shandong), Xu (ÂæêÂ∑û, modern northern Jiangsu and Anhui), Jing (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei), and Yong (ÈõçÂ∑û, modern central and northern Shaanxi) Provinces. I hope that soon someone will succeed me here, so that I may return and expend all my effort for the empire -- so that I do not have unspent strength while I am alive and regrets when I die. (At that time, Qing, Xu, and Jing Provinces were under Jin rule, while Yong Province was under Later Qin, so Murong Nong was showing his ambition in conquering or at least defeating Jin and Later Qin.) Murong Chui, upon receiving the report, summoned Murong Nong to the capital, and had his brother Murong Long the Prince of Gaoyang succeed him at Longcheng. For the next several years, Murong Nong participated in a number of his father's campaigns and was particularly effective in the campaign that destroyed the independent state of Wei and its emperor Zhai Zhao in 392. He also played a major role in Later Yan's destruction of Western Yan in 394, allowing Later Yan to seize modern Shanxi. In 394, Murong Nong attacked Jin's Qing Province, then under the governance of former Later Yan vassal Bil√º Hun (ËæüÈñ≠Ê∏æ) and had some success against Bil√º, but around the new year 395, for reasons unknown, Murong Chui ordered him to return to Zhongshan and abandon the campaign. During Murong Chui's reign, Murong Nong and Murong Long were the most well-regarded princes. Because of this, Murong Chui's wife Empress Duan Yuanfei once suggested to him that the crown prince Murong Bao lacked abilities to govern, and Murong Chui should choose either Murong Nong or Murong Long instead. Murong Chui, believing Murong Bao to be capable, rejected her suggestion. Murong Nong's aura of invincibility, however, began to wane in 395‚Äîalbeit in a campaign that he was not the supreme commander of. That year, aggravated by the harassing raids by the former Later Yan vassal Northern Wei's prince Tuoba Gui, Murong Chui sent Murong Bao to command an 80,000-men army, with Murong Nong and Murong Lin as his assistant commanders, to try to crush Northern Wei. However, after stalemates with Northern Wei near Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, Murong Bao retreated after false reports of Murong Chui's death‚Äîand was, in retreat, crushed by Tuoba Gui at the Battle of Canhe Slope, with loss of nearly the entire army. Murong Nong was, along with his brothers, able to escape death. In early 396, Murong Chui personally led forces to try to force Northern Wei's submission, and Murong Nong and Murong Long were the forward commanders. They had initial successes against Northern Wei, but as the army passed through Canhe Slope, they mourned in such a great manner that Murong Chui, in shame and anger, grew ill, and the army was forced to retreat. He died soon thereafter and was succeeded by Murong Bao. During Murong Bao's reign Murong Bao, although aware of Empress Duan's earlier suggestion to make Murong Nong or Murong Long crown prince (and in fact was so resentful of it that he forced her to commit suicide), appeared to trust his brothers greatly, and he made Murong Nong the viceroy of Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, modern central and northern Shanxi) to guard against a Northern Wei attack. However, Murong Nong immediately made the mistakes of collecting food for his troops‚Äîtoo much for the local population, then suffering from a famine, to support‚Äîand sending military officers to watch over non-Han tribes. The people became resolved to revolt, and they sent messengers to Northern Wei, requesting Tuoba Gui to advance on Bing Province. In late fall 396, he arrived at the capital of the province, Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and when Murong Nong engaged Tuoba Gui in battle, Tuoba Gui defeated him, and he was forced to flee back to Zhongshan, but his wife and children were captured by Northern Wei and he himself was wounded. Tuoba Gui continued his advance on Zhongshan. Murong Bao gave Murong Nong a small force to command in the defense of Zhongshan, but most of the military matters were entrusted to Murong Lin the Prince of Zhao, who advised Murong Bao not to engage Northern Wei forces, much to the frustration of Murong Nong and Murong Long. In spring 397, after Murong Lin failed in a coup attempt, he fled out of the capital, and Murong Bao, in fear that Murong Lin would seize a relief force commanded by his son Murong Hui the Prince of Qinghe, decided to abandon Zhongshan. Murong Nong's and Murong Long's subordinates tried to persuade each to stay in Zhongshan rather than to follow Murong Bao, but each refused, feeling that loyalty to their brother required them to follow him. They therefore followed Murong Bao and joined Murong Hui's army. However, Murong Hui was resentful that he was not made crown prince, a position given to his younger brother Murong Ce (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ≠ñ), and he considered seizing the position by force. Murong Bao, realizing this, tried to transfer some of Murong Hui's army to the commands of Murong Nong and Murong Long, but this only made Murong Hui more resentful, and he acted first against his uncles, sending assassins against them. Murong Long was killed, but Murong Nong survived the attack but was severely wounded (described as having suffered a wound so deep that his brain was visible), and Murong Hui, who then openly declared a coup, was then defeated and killed. Murong Bao, who settled in at Longcheng, made Murong Nong his prime minister. At Murong Nong's suggestion, Murong Bao initially stopped his thoughts of regaining the lost provinces, but in early 398, against the advice of Murong Nong and Murong Sheng the Prince of Changle, Murong Bao resolved to try to advance south‚Äîbut his army was worn out. As soon as Murong Bao left Longcheng, his general Duan Sugu (ÊÆµÈÄüÈ™®) started a rebellion, and the army abandoned Murong Bao, who immediately fled back to Longcheng. Meanwhile, Duan, having forced Murong Long's son Murong Chong (ÊÖïÂÆπÂ¥á) the Prince of Gaoyang as leader, sieged Longcheng. Even with secret help from Lan Han the Prince of Dunqiu‚ÄîMurong Chui's uncle‚Äîhowever, Duan was initially unsuccessful, until Murong Nong inexplicably, in fear of his life, surrendered to him. This greatly destroyed the morale of Longcheng's defense forces, as everyone relied on Murong Nong's leadership, and Longcheng fell to Duan. Duan imprisoned Murong Nong, but his strategist Ajiao Luo (Èòø‰∫§ÁæÖ) suggested that Murong Nong might be a better puppet than Murong Chong. Upon hearing this news, however, Murong Chong's attendants Zong Rang (È¨∑ËÆì) and Chuli Jian (Âá∫ÂäõÁäç) assassinated Ajiao and Murong Nong. 398 deaths Former Yan people Former Qin people Later Yan generals Later Yan imperial princes Year of birth unknown ","title":"Murong Nong"},{"id":"4334380","text":"Pinal de Amoles is a town located in Pinal de Amoles Municipality in the state of Quer√©taro in central Mexico. It is part of the Sierra Gorda region which stretches over northern Quer√©taro into Guanajuato, Hidalgo and San Luis Potos√≠, with 88% of the municipality's land comprising the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve. The municipality contains large areas of forests and the highest peaks in the region, which separate the wetter areas of both the north and east from the drier areas of the south and west. The town began as a mining camp in the 17th century. However, most mining in the area has disappeared and the municipality is one of the poorest in Mexico, despite recent efforts to promote ecotourism and restart mining. This has led a large number of residents to migrate to larger cities in Mexico and to the United States to work, sending remittances back home. These remittances now overshadow the locally generated economy. The town The town of Pinal de Amoles, was founded as Real de San Jos√© de Amoles, in the early 17th century as a mining camp. Today, much of that mining has disappeared, but the town remains. It is located 153 km north of the state capital, straddling Federal Highway 120, which connects it to San Juan del R√≠o in the south and the state of San Luis Potos√≠ in the north. The town located at an altitude of 2,320 meters above sea level, on small flat spaces on a mountain with a population of 1,582 (2005). For this reason, it has narrow winding streets and many inclines. Most of the streets are of cobblestone and many houses are painted red, ochre or yellow, with colorful balconies. There is no municipal market but the traditional tianguis is held on Sundays. This features basic products, especially locally produced fruits and vegetables in season. It also features locally produced coffee and breads such as pan de pulque (pulque bread). The town center consists of a very small plaza which fronts the local parish church of San Jos√©, dedicated to Saint Joseph. The San Jos√© Church was begun in 1770 and inaugurated in 1771. It has a simple design with a traditional pediment on its facade. On the right hand side, there is a bell tower with three levels. The town and the immediate surroundings have six main hotels, several of which also operate cabins in the nearby mountain areas. These include Hotel Restaurante \\"El Molcajete,‚Äù Hotel Restaurante ‚ÄúMes√≥n del Barretero,‚Äù Hotel Restaurante ‚ÄúLos Pinos,‚Äù Caba√±as ‚ÄúCinco Pinos,‚Äù ‚ÄúHotel Plaza‚Äù and ‚ÄúPosada Real de San Jos√©.‚Äù Restaurants include Restaurante ‚ÄúLa Cueva‚Äù, Restaurante ‚ÄúEl Chino‚Äù, Restaurante ‚ÄúChayito‚Äù, Restaurante ‚ÄúEl Nopal‚Äù, Loncher√≠a ‚ÄúVanesa‚Äù, Tacos ‚ÄúEl Mexicano‚Äù, Fonda ‚ÄúPera‚Äù, ‚ÄúFonda Chepita‚Äù, ‚ÄúFonda Lucerito‚Äù, ‚ÄúFonda La G√ºera‚Äù, Antojitos Mexicanos ‚ÄúVicky‚Äù and ‚ÄúRestaurante Bar Mineros‚Äù. Local food specialties include cecina, pacholes (toasted sweets made from corn), tamales with cheese, gorditas, pan de pulque, barbacoa, wines and liquors made from various fruits, pulque and aguamiel. Because of its altitude and fairly abundant rainfall, the climate is primarily cold, with fog not being uncommon. It is surrounded by forests, canyons, arroyos, waterfalls and green fields. History The word ‚Äúpinal‚Äù is Spanish and means ‚Äúpine forest.‚Äù ‚ÄúAmoles‚Äù is from the Nahuatl ‚Äúamolli‚Äù ‚Äì a name of a root often used as a detergent. The municipality's seal contains an ‚Äúamilli‚Äù, along with an eagle with its wings extended to signify hospitality. There are branches and four pine cones to represent the various conifers that grow abundantly in the area, the Cerro de Media Luna mountain and a pick and shovel to represent the area's past of mining silver, mercury, gold, antimony and other metals. A cross and sword represents the Spanish conquest and evangelization. The date of 1932 signifies the establishment of the municipality. The date of 19 March 1606 represents the founding of the Spanish town. The first inhabitants of the region were hunter-gatherers as early as 6000 BC. Starting from the 13th century groups of Pames and Chichimeca Jonaz came to the area. Communities of these groups were still found in areas such as El Cuervo, Puerto de Vigas, El Rodezno, Tonatico, Escanela and others when the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. Starting from 1534, the Spanish established the province of Xilotepec, which encompassed much of the land around what is now the Sierra Gorda in Quer√©taro, but it did not manage to dominate this area for centuries because of the fierce resistance of the native peoples, especially the Chichimeca Jonaz. However, the Spanish penetrated the area for evangelization, military purposes and prospecting. The first mine was in Escanelas in 1599. Pinal de Amoles, initially called Real de San Jos√© de Amoles, was established in 1606. It was named an Alcald√≠a Mayor Real with official jurisdiction over what is now the municipalities of Arroyo Seco, Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros, Pinal de Amoles, San Joaqu√≠n, Pe√±amiller and Cadereyta de Montes. However, this seat of government would be transferred to Cadereyta as the silver from the mines dwindled by 1675. However, this Alcald√≠a Mayor would form over half of the future state of Quer√©taro. Mission church of Ahuacatl√°n Another tactic the Spanish used to try and dominate the region was the establishment of missions to convert the indigenous peoples to Catholicism. The mission at Ahuacatl√°n was founded in 1693 by the Dominicans. Complete Spanish domination would come in the mid 18th century, with the defeat of the Chichimeca Jonaz at the Battle of Media Luna, which took place in the municipality. To consolidate this hold, Spanish missionaries under Jun√≠pero Serra established five Franciscan missions in the heart of the Chichimeca Sierra Gorda just to the north of Pinal de Amoles, in Jalpan de Serra and other municipalities. As municipality's settlements grew, new churches were established. The church of San Jose was constructed in 1770. The Bucarieli Mission was founded by Guadalupe Soriano in 1775. He also built the church at San Antonio Escanelilla. After Mexico's independence, most of the area's mines gave out, eliminating the base of most of the area's economy. Since then, Pinal de Amoles and the rest of the Sierra Gorda in Quer√©taro would remain underdeveloped compared to the rest of the state. The district of Jalpan was founded in 1825 which included Arroyo Seco, Landa de Matamoros, Jalpan and Pinal de Amoles. During the second half of the 19th century, this district began to subdivide. First the municipality of Ahuacatl√°n de Guadalupe separated from Jalpan de Serra in 1866, and included Pinal de Amoles, San Pedro Escanela and Bucareli. It would then become a sub prefecture of Jalpan, with government offices moved to Pinal de Amoles in 1894. Other government reorganization included the naming of Pinal de Amoles as a ‚Äúmunicipal presidencia‚Äù in 1914, Pinal de Amoles was officially declared a town and San Antonio Escanellilla becoming a sub delegation in 1924. The municipality's current status as a free municipality came in 1932, with Ahuacatl√°n, San Antonio Escanelilla, San Pedro Escanela and Bucareli as delegations. In 1944, the delegation of Santa √Ågueda de Pusungu√≠a was added. While mining declined after Independence, it never ceased completely and there were various operations in the 19th and 20th centuries. En English company installed itself to mine silver in Pinal de Amoles in 1865. A Mexican company was founded in 1887 for the same purpose. A US company called El Soyatal began mining antimony in 1944. Mercury mining began again in 1960, which caused an economic boom, but by 1970, prices for this element fell and ended most of the mining here. In 2001, the state taxation authority identified major irregularities with the public records of Pinal de Amoles with up to eight million pesos missing. Ecological projects such as those to clean the waters in local canyons were begun between 2001 and 2003. In 2007, a sewerage treatment plant was inaugurated in Ahuacatl√°n, mostly paid for by the state and federal governments. The goal of the plant is to prevent contamination of waters in the Escanela, Chuveje and Ahuacatl√°n Rivers, which lead to the Jalpan Dam. Environment Like the rest of the Sierra Gorda region, Pinal de Amoles is marked by very rugged terrain, which includes canyons and steep mountains. The area is located in an area with extremely high peaks with small flat areas and mesas. The altitude varies between 839masl at the community of Huajales to 3350masl at the Cerro de la Calentura, which is also the highest point in the state. Eighty eight percent of the municipality's territory belongs to the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve of Quer√©taro, a region which is protected because of its extreme diversity of landscapes, climates, vegetation and wildlife. Pinal de Amoles represents the highest peaks of this region, which essentially separate the wetter lands to the north and east from the semi arid areas of the south and west as the mountains block moisture coming in from the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the rock is sedimentary, with about 45% limestone. About 15% is intrusive volcanic rock. This due to the fact that much of the Sierra Gorda was sea bed millions of years ago, with volcanic activity later in its geological history. The volcanic rock accounts for most of the municipality's minable deposits. Rivers are fast flowing due to the geography. The two most important rivers are the Extoraz in the south flowing east and El Rodezno or R√≠o Escanela, which flows past Escanela, Escanelila and Ahuacatl√°n, emptying into the Jalpan Dam. There are also 169 bodies of surface water which include 143 fresh water springs, six small dams and 20 streams. In the entire region, the coldest temperatures occur between December and January, with high temperatures in April and May. Temperatures vary widely depending on altitude with an annual average of 13C in the higher elevations such as Pinal de Amoles to 24C in lower areas such as Jalpan. In the highest elevations, frosts and freezes are not uncommon. The north of the municipality is dominated by deciduous rainforest, which loses much of its leaves in the dry season. The center and northwest are dominated by pine and oak forests. Pine and holm oak forests are found mostly above 2,000 masl. The forests of the municipality are its most important natural resource. The types of wildlife is very varied and includes white-tailed deer, pumas, tigrillos (Leopardus tigrinus or Leopardus wiedii), bobcats, coyotes, raccoons, opossums, armadillos, foxes, skunks, hares and rabbits. Birds are especially varied and include woodpeckers, American goldfinches, sparrows, parrots, macaws and ravens. Reptiles include rattlesnakes and coral snakes as well as ‚Äúriver shrimp‚Äù or acamaya. A group of researchers from the Natural Sciences Faculty of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Quer√©taro have discovered a new species of crustacean similar to a very large shrimp or small lobster in the municipality. The crustacean is found in fresh water mostly in the Platanos Arroyo and can grow to a size of up to eight centimeters. Locally, the creature is called an ‚Äúacocil‚Äù or freshwater lobster, like other creatures found in other parts of Mexico. However, studies have shown that this crustacean show enough peculiarities to warrant it as a separate species. The formal name for it is Procambarus Yacoy. There three main types of climate. The first is temperate and humid, with rains in the summer and an average annual temperature of between 12 and 18C. There is little rain in the winter but the annual average is about 850mm. This climate prevails at altitudes over 2,000 masl. There is a semi hot and dry climate in areas with average annual temperatures between 18 and 22C with rains in the summer and little rain in winter. Average annual precipitation is about 500mm. Areas with a semi hot and humid climates have similar rainfall patterns but with an average rainfall of just under 1000mm. Summers here are hot and humid. Like in the rest of the Sierra Gorda, the coldest temperatures occur between December and January, with high temperatures in April and May. In the highest elevations, many of which are in Pinal de Amoles, frosts, freezes and even snow are not uncommon. Recent significant freezes, frosts and snows have occurred in 2007 and 2010 with very high altitude communities such as San Gaspar most affected. The ice and snow make driving dangerous on Highway 120, as it has an abundance of curves. This can form ‚Äúblack ice‚Äù which is an invisible layer of ice over the earth, which can lower air temperatures further. The government works to help poorer communities deal with the cold conditions year with advisories. In 2010, the Sierra Gorda had it first significant snowfall in eighteen years in the municipality, with temperatures of -4C. In some places, the cover was 15 cm deep. Most of the municipality is covered in forest of one type or another, and these forests are its main natural resource. These forests have been having problems in recent years between insect and parasitic plant infestations and logging. The infestations have been more severe than usual because of drought conditions weakening trees. While there are strict environmental laws for the area as part of the biosphere reserve, enforcement is spotty. The forests of this and neighboring municipalities have attracting illegal logging from those outside the area. Pinal de Amoles is one of the Sierra Gorda municipalities where this problem is the most serious. In 2005, a road was built between El Llano de Huaxquilico to San Pedro Escanela, but it is controversial because of environmental concerns. Its building caused severe ecological damage in an area considered to be one of the most sensitive in the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve, as it is where most of the local aquifers recharge. The area receives a large amount of rain, which has led to damage and mudslides affecting the road, making it almost impossible for more than one car to pass at a time. The rugged terrain of the area gives rise to a number of waterfalls, forests, canyons, springs and other natural attractions. El Chuveje is one of the largest waterfalls in the state, measuring about thirty meters high and with a strong steady fall of water surrounded by mountains and vegetation. Activities include hiking, camping and bird watching with macaws and white tailed deer still to be seen although there are fewer than in the past. The waterfall is located a couple of kilometers from the park entrance and can only be reached by foot. The El Salto waterfall is located in San Pedro Escanela, with a height of 35 meters. The water falls into a clear pond at the foot of the elevation then forms a small river. It is not easy to reach and recommended only for experienced hikers. The Puente de Dios (Bridge of God) is a natural bridge located on the side of a small mountain near the Pe√±a de la Gloria. The site of the bridge is a deep crevasse with thick vegetation and under the bridge a river with two small waterfalls flows. The La Angostura Canyon is about fifty meters long and contains part of the Escanela River, the same that passes through the Puente de Dios and then empties into the Ayutla River. The canyon contains several places where the water pools and are suitable for swimming in the summer. The Infiernillo Arroyo is found within a kilometer long canyon. In the lower part, there are various pools of blue water along with small waterfalls. Around these is thick vegetation. Sideview of Puente de Dios River, Pinal de Amoles, Quer√©taro, M√©xico The Barranca Arroyo is a small canyon structure about an hour and a half from the municipal seat. The water flows year round with several areas where it pools, but the water is cold. The area is surrounded by large mountains with abundant vegetation. There is camping, hiking and picnicking. The Pe√±a de la Viuda is a natural monolith which falls directly into an arroyo. The area has abundant vegetation, and activities such as skiing, camping and hiking. La Escondida is an area in mountainous forest with a permanent fresh water spring. It permits camping and hiking. El Cidral is an area with cedar trees surrounding a clearing for camping and hiking. The Pe√±a de la Glora waterfall is surrounded by thick vegetation. The lowest part has a natural spring and the upper part has a deep, unexplored cave. The Cueva de los Riscos (Cave of the Crags) is named after the crags which appear in various of its chambers. The entrance begins with a rocky descent then levels out to an area with sand. The center has a hillock with looks like a monolith rock. This can be climbed to observe the various crags with contain ice. One of these in the shape of a pulpit and another is called the ‚Äúbell tower‚Äù because if it is struck it sounds like a bell. Culture Dancers at the 2011 Concurso Nacional de Bailes Huapango Each of the major communities of the municipalities have their annual festival, set on the day of their patron saint. These include Pinal de Amoles (March 16‚Äì19), San Pedro Escanela, (May 1‚Äì5 and June 27‚Äì29), Ahuacatl√°n de Guadalupe (December 12), Santa √Ågueda (February 5), Bucareli (October 4 and December 8) and Escaelilla (June 13). Municipality wide there is the annual ‚ÄúLa Molienda‚Äù from the beginning of February to the middle of March. This is related to the harvest of sugar cane although nowadays, there are fewer fields that grow this crop. The tradition includes cutting a cane to extract its juice in a press or mill. With the juice boiled down and the remaining dry cane used as fuel or animal feed. The boiled sugar cane juice is made into a syrup, which is then molded into small pillars called piloncillos. Pinal de Amoles, like the rest of the Sierra Gorda, has been classified as the far west of the La Huasteca region. Huapango is a tradition in the Sierra Gorda and the people here identify themselves as part of the La Huasteca region, according to Jorge Enrique Resend√≠z Mart√≠nez, municipal president of Pinal de Amoles. This Huasteca influence is best seen in the tradition of Huapango music and dance, which is strongest here and in other Sierra Gorda communities such as Xich√∫ and San Joaqu√≠n, where there are festivals dedicated to it. Huapango musicians from Pinal de Amoles are noted for their ability to improvise melodies and lyrics, but the main event for the year is the Concurso Nacional de Bailes de Huapango held each year in the municipal seat in March. 2011 marked the twenty second annual event, which originally was called the Concuso Nacional de Baile de Huapango y Reuni√≥n de las Huastecas. In this year, there were more than 400 couples registered in the competition with about 10,000 spectators in attendance, as the event grows each year. The event is held at the Casa de la Cultura (House of Culture), with three categories: children's (under 12), youth (13 to 17) and adult (over 18). Entrance fee is 100 pesos per couple. Various styles of Huapango dance is presented including hidalguense, poblano, potosino, queretano, tamaulipeco and veracruzano, named after the states of Hidalgo, Puebla, San Luis Potos√≠, Quer√©taro, Tamaulipas and Veracruz respectively. It begins on Friday night and concludes on Sunday night. The children's category is exposition only, with the other two having eliminations. The judging panels are made up of representatives of these states, who qualify technique, dress, projection, coordination and precision. The winners of various categories received between four and six thousand pesos, with the overall winner for each age group receiving between 14,000 and 20,000 pesos. Those couples who have won the grand prize in previous years are not allowed to participate again together. For 2011, the groups presenting live music for the event included Los Hidalguenses, Reales de Colima and Huapangueros Differentes. The event is concurrent with the Fiestas Patronales or feast day of the patron saint of the municipality. This event in 2011 featured popular rock groups such as Pambo Pop-rock and Pega Pega de Emilio Reyna. Economy Only just over eighteen percent of the total population is economically active. Just over 50% of these are dedicated to agriculture, livestock, forestry, fishing and hunting. Of a total of 60,970 hectares in the municipality, 32,901 are forest, 23,176 are used for livestock and 4,893 are cultivated. The only irrigated land is located in Misi√≥n de Bucareli with 71 hectares and Medias Coloradas with 32 hectares. Most crops are for auto consumption and include corn, beans, chickpeas, chili peppers, potatoes and tomatoes. The area has climates suited for the cultivation of apples, but pears, peaches, quince and figs are also grown. In the small subtropical area there is the production of limes, lemons, papaya, mangos, guavas, peaches, coffee, avocados, sugar cane, blackberries, pineapples and ornamental plants. Livestock is mostly cattle with some sheep, goats and pigs. Local livestock farmers have a cooperative to help with the acquisition of supplies. In the early 2000s, apple growers in the region found that they could not sell their fruit, not because of taste but because it is smaller and has a less shiny appearance than fruit from the north of Mexico, the US and Chile. In 2003, apple growers from Pinal de Amoles and other nearby municipalities came together to find ways of marketing their product. The result is the production of apple juice, produced by a cooperative. Initial taste tests were positive but marketing was a challenge. Business students helped out and eventually the product began to appear on store shelves in various parts of Mexico and even in the US. In 2005, the cooperative signed a deal with bottlers to sell 60 tons of Quer√©taro Golden apples as 550,000 250-ml boxes of juice. Just under seventeen percent of the population is dedicated to mining, infrastructure and construction. Only three percent are dedicated to manufacturing, mostly handcrafts. Handcrafts in the area include objects made from leather, palm fronds, silver, gold, wire, wool, wood and stone. Municipal president has announced plans to reactivate mining in the municipality to create jobs. He stated that it needs to be done because it is a part of the area's history. There are mines in San Gaspar, R√≠o Escanela and Bucareli among others which generate three hundred jobs, extracting mercury, silver and antimony. About twenty one percent are dedicated to services, tourism and general commerce. For the Sierra Gorda area, tourism, especially ecotourism is a new and important source of income for the region. As the municipality contains many of the highest peaks of the Sierra Gorda, much of the area is covered by fog and clouds for at least part of the day. Natural areas for visitors include El Camposanto Viejo and El Cruz de Palo with camping, hiking and rustic playgrounds for children. Campamento R√≠o Escanela Enclavado is located along the Escanela River with a path that leads to the Angostura Canyon and the Puente de Dios. The nearby townof R√≠o Escanela is an old mining community surrounded by forest. The facility has cabins, camping area, showers, picnic tables, grills and food services. Campamento Las Trancas in Potrerillos is a camping location just outside the municipal seat. In November 2010, it installed the first extreme sporting facility in the Sierra Gorda, a zip-line which measures about one hundred meters and crosses a deep narrow canyon. One ecotourism site is in Cuatro Palos, a village of thirty homes just outside the municipal seat. It is a campground which is one of twelve founded by The Ecological Group, a service organization dedicated to promoting alternative economies based on ecologically sensitive technologies. About thirty women from the village work at the campground as a cooperative. The campground has dry toilets in which lime, sawdust and solar energy are used to produce compost. There have also been some solar panels installed. There are also a number of small archeological sites and historic monuments. Pinal de Amoles has had problems with the sacking of these sites, but now programs have been started to halt this activity and create tourist routes based on the sites. Pinal de Amoles has been ranked as one of the poorest in the country of Mexico, with the lowest levels of income by the United Nations Development Programme. and one of the highest levels of economic marginalization. Only about 18% of the residents are economically active, 45% of which are homemakers, with the rest students and retirees. About half of the population is considered to be very poor, with ten percent considered to be living in deplorable conditions with no public services at all. For this reason, many from this municipality and others from the Sierra Gorda, have migrated out to cities in Mexico and to the United States in order to work. The municipality estimates that about 35% of its population has migrated abroad, equaling about 8 thousand people. Others suggest the numbers are even higher, with an estimate of four people in the United States for each family here. No one knows exactly how many from the state of Quer√©taro have gone to the U.S. to work or the amount which is sent back in remittances each year. However, it is estimated that the Sierra Gorda region receives between 50,000 and US$100,000 per day or 18.2 million dollars each year. This is larger than the municipal budget of Pinal de Amoles. These remittances have come to overshadow earnings made locally from small shops, livestock and agriculture. In Pinal de Amoles and other areas of the Sierra Gorda, the dollar has become part of the economy, especially around Christmas when many come back to visit families for the holiday season. This has led to many businesses accepting the dollar as a medium of exchange in many businesses including restaurants and bars. Many families now use it as a regional currency. However, remittance money sent back can vary depending on economic and political factors. As of January 2011, the amount sent back to the Sierra Gorda fell about forty percent. Officials blame the security situation on the US-Mexican border, with many younger people in the US not visiting during the Christmas season. The money sent back by those in the United States is so important that Pinal de Amoles is one of the sponsors of the annual ‚ÄúD√≠a del Paisano‚Äù (Day of the Countryman) event which honors migrant workers visiting at Christmas time. The event is held in Jalpan de Serra and includes contests, raffles and more. This money is not only sent back directly to families but is also the basis for a number of public works projects. In the early 2000s, migrants from Quer√©taro formed a Federaci√≥n de Clubes de Migrantes de la Sierra Gorda, in order to donate to public works projects in their hometowns. It consists of twenty seven smaller groups, eight of which are from Pina de Amoles, to spur economic development. Under a program \\"Queretaro Unidos Tres por Uno\\" each dollar sent by residents abroad is matched by the federal and state governments to three dollars as part of a nationwide program sponsored by the Secretaria de Desarrollo Sustentable. Most of the projects have been related to paving, running water and sewerage, but have also included electrical networks, schools, health centers and computer equipment. The death of sixteen residents in 2006 and 2007 and the lack of employment pushed the municipality in 2007 to start promoting legal emigration to the United States. For this purpose, municipal resources have been budgeted, and a liaison with the U.S. embassy established to help residents get visas. In 2007, forty residents succeeded in getting legal work visas through the program, who mostly went to Escondido, California. Each of these applications cost the municipality 5,000 pesos, which includes transportation north. Transportation and communications The municipality has 399.4 km of roadway, which includes 56 km of federal highway. However, about 40% is dirt road linking about 70% of the communities. There is bus service that passes through the municipality on its way to Jalpan from both the city of Quer√©taro and Mexico City. Regional newspapers include : Voz de la Sierra, Mensajero de la Sierra, La Versi√≥n, El Observador and Sierra Gorda. State papers include La Sombra de Arteaga, Noticias and Diario de Quer√©taro. Archeology Fossils of ammonites, trilobites, snails and oysters have been found which date back to between 250 and 125 million years. El Quirambal is located between the municipal seat and Escanela. It is an archeological zone similar to the larger sites of Las Ranas and Toluquilla further south in the Sierra Gorda. It was inhabited by the Serrana Culture between 200 and 1200 CE with mining as its main economic activity. Among its main structures there is the Mesoamerican ball court which measures forty by twenty meters, which is flanked by a temple with a pyramid base seven meters high and fourteen meters on each side. There are various other pyramid and residential structures along with large terraces which were dug into the hillside to create more flat space. The construction from 800 to 1200 CE was similar to other areas of the La Huasteca.

Its territory is part of the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve of Quer√©taro. The municipality is centered on the small town of Arroyo Seco, which was established as a military outpost then given town status in 1833 under the name of Villa de Guadalupe before changing to its current name. The town gained municipal status in 1931. The area is very rural with most people living in communities of under 100 people, with significant Pame communities. It has a traditional economy based on agriculture, livestock and forestry but it is also one of the poorest in Mexico, with high rates of emigration, especially sending migrant workers to the United States. It is estimated that one in four households in the municipality receives money from family members in this country. The municipality is also home to one of five Franciscan mission complexes built under the tenure of Jun√≠pero Serra, located in the community of Conc√°. The town Arroyo Seco is a small town of about three hundred homes centered on a plaza named after Mariano Escobedo. The town originated as a military outpost called the Presido de Arroyo Seco. It became the seat of the municipality of the same name in 1931. The houses are painted in various colors and its streets are quiet. The town is home to all municipal services and has the most developed infrastructure and social services in the area. This includes the Casa de Cultura cultural center, an auditorium and a library. The Mariano Escobedo plaza has an ‚Äúoriental‚Äù style kiosk surrounded by large trees. On one side the main parish church called the Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe dominates. This church was begun in 1904 and was supposed to be much larger than it is, but construction was suspended due to the Mexican Revolution. It has an austere facade and the interior has black pews. The most important yearly event in the municipal seat is the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe on 12 December. Handcrafts such as saddles, leather goods and wooden barrels for water storage can be found in the town. Environment Area between Conc√° and Arroyo Seco (town) The municipality is part of the Sierra Gorda region, which is centered on northern Quer√©taro state. This region is a branch of the Sierra Madre Oriental, consisting of mountain chains that parallel the Gulf of Mexico. This land was sea bed 100 million years ago, which formed ancient sedimentary rock, mostly limestone, which easily erodes. This makes the area part of the Huasteca Karst Arroyo Seco is completely within the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve of Quer√©taro, which was established in 1997. Most of the territory is mountainous, with gradients of over 25%. Altitudes in the territory range from 560 to 1340 masl with an average of 980masl. The mountain formations are subdivided into two parts. The first is a corridor along the border with Jalpan which is over forty km long and five km wide. This area has some very low valleys of only 700 masl. The second area is more rugged with canyons of up to 600 meters deep and peaks which reach over 2000 masl. There are a number of flat areas and valleys which are mostly along the Ayutla and Conc√° rivers. The principal elevations are Santo Domingo, Cantera, Cofrad√≠a, Soledad and Pitorreal. The terrain is composed of sedimentary rock, mostly layers of limestone, which present on the surface with medium or fine grain and sometimes as clay. It, like most of the Sierra Gorda, is on former sea bed from 150 million years ago. Recently, Arroyo Seco and other municipalities of the Sierra Gorda have reported numerous small earthquakes. According to seismologists, these are caused by the movement of water through sedimentary rock. Erosion causes gaps and then the gaps settle onto themselves, causing the small quakes. One thing scientists are checking for is to see if any areas stand over underground cavities which may give way. The area's location over the Huasteca Karst and the erosion of limestone has given rise to numerous pit caves. The largest of these in the Sierra Gorda is located in Arroyo Seco, called the S√≥tano de Barro, located in the Santa Mar√≠a de los Cocos community. The S√≥tano del Barro is one of the largest cavities of the world by volume, measuring 15 million cubic metres, surpassed only the Sima Mayor de Sarisari√±ama in Venezuela. In comparison, the S√≥tano de Las Golondrinas has a volume of only five million meters cubed. Its widest diameter measures 420 meters and its average width is 200 meters. It has a total depth of 455 meters with a direct drop of 410 meters. Its perimeter is surrounded by dense vegetation, which is a sanctuary for green macaws. It requires a walk or mule ride of about two hours through dense forest to reach. The walls of the pit cave are mostly vertical and partially covered by vegetation. At the bottom of the cave there is a small forest on a floor which was sea bed 100 million years ago, which measures 220 meters long and 100 meters wide. Despite its depth, the bottom of the pit cave receives an abundance of sunlight allowing for the growth of trees and other vegetation, making it an isolated mini forest. The bottom also has a number of small caves, with the largest fifty meters long. This pit cave has been classified as the deepest in the world although this has recently been challenged by those who wish to include those pit caves which are not continuous such as the Stary Swistak in Austria, which has a total depth of 480 meters. Principal river systems include the Santa Mar√≠a, the Ayutla River and the Jalpan River with their tributaries such as the Conc√° River in the south of the municipality. The Santa Mar√≠a enters the municipality from San Luis Potos√≠ and flows along a 400 meter deep canyon until it merges with the Ayutla River. This river flows northeast, forming another canyon then merges with the Jalpan River. There are about 100 accessible sources of water in the municipality with most located in the communities of Salitrillo, Conc√° and Ayutla. The municipality is home to the junction of two of the major rivers of the Sierra Gorda, the Santa Mar√≠a and the Ayutla River at a location called Las Adjuntas. The Santa Mar√≠a River here flows warm to hot in the summer and the Ayutla River remains cold. Although the two rivers have different water colors and temperatures, both are regulated by the surrounding environment. The Santa Mar√≠a River has a number of beaches which are open to camping. There is also sports fishing of native catfish. The northern border of the municipality is partially formed by the Verde River. The Conc√° Waterfall is located just south of the town of the same name. This waterfall is fed by a fresh water spring and falls into the Santa Mar√≠a River. Despite the name (which means dry stream or dry arroyo), most of the arroyos in the area have water in them most of the year. The municipality has ten easily accessible sources of surface water. However, the over extraction of water has led to dropping water tables and many of the area's fresh water springs are flowing at slower rates or have dried up. The municipality divides into two climate regions. The north is semi arid with an average temperature of 22C and an annual rainfall of between five and 10.5mm per falling mostly in the summer. The other is semi hot with average temperatures varying from 18 to 22C with rains in the summer. In the winter, the area is vulnerable to cold spells, brought in by cold fronts that arrive from the north and west. The cold spells do not usually reach freezing as the municipality does not have the high peaks that neighbors such as Pinal de Amoles does, but snow mixed with rain fell in 2006 and in 2010, freezing temperatures did reach communities such as La Florida and San Juan Buenaventura. Very cold temperatures can prompt emergency services such as the provision of blankets by the municipality's civil protection service or evacuation to shelters. Communities which are most vulnerable to severe cold include La Sanguijuela, La Escondida de Guadalupe, La Cantera, R√≠o del Carrizal and El Durazno. The area has had problems with droughts over the past decade, especially in 2009, which have been draining reserves and aquifers. The lack of water has caused the deaths of livestock and forced more people to emigrate from the municipality. Many communities now must rely on water trucked in from outside. Vegetation on the limestone and other sedimentary soils ranges from lowland rainforest to grasslands to scrub brush in more arid areas. In forested areas, the trees include oaks, pines, white cedar, strawberry trees and oyamels. In the drier areas, there are also mesquite trees with some other desert plants including cactus. In the lowest elevations there are tropical hardwoods such as red cedar, Montezuma cypress and a tree called the ‚Äúparota.‚Äù Wildlife mostly consists of birds and mammals such as doves, quails, chachalacas, eagles, roadrunners, and some waterfowl. Mammals include squirrels, rabbits, armadillos, white-tailed deer, foxes, coyotes, wild boar, pumas, raccoons, skunks, and opossums. There are some reptiles such as rattlesnakes and coral snakes. Culture The most popular traditional music is Huapango, especially Huapango arribe√±o. It is most often played in ‚Äútopadas‚Äù a type of musical duel between two musicians competing on improvisation of lyrics and melodies. Many of the songs are about history, arte and current events. In 2006, Guadalupe Reyes Reyes from El Refugio won the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in the Popular Arts category. He won the award for his contributions to Huapango arribe√±o. Reyes formed the band, Los Reyes de El Refugio and their work mostly focuses on rural life in the Sierra Gorda. He was born 1931, but had to work at farming early, learning to read and write mostly on his own. He was taught guitar and found he had musical ability, becoming a cantor at the local church when he was 14. Typical dishes include jerky, cecina, ‚ÄúSerrano‚Äù style enchiladas and pit cooked barbacoa. Sweets include ‚Äúchancaquillas‚Äù which is made with piloncillo and squash seeds. Beverages include aguamiel and pulque along with atole with sunflower seeds. The various communities have festivals in honor of local patron saints, but the most important festival in the municipality is that honoring the Archangel Michael on 29 September. It is celebrated with street fairs and crafts exhibitions. The mission church of Conc√° Facade of the mission church at Conc√° The mission complex at Conc√° is one of five Franciscan missions which were built under the direction of Jun√≠pero Serra in the mid-to- late 18th century. The missions were the last in a long line of evangelization efforts in the Sierra Gorda, which were resisted by the indigenous peoples, especially the Chichimeca Jonaz for about two centuries. This resistance was militarily broken at the Battle of Media Luna in 1748. To consolidate Spanish dominance, the Franciscans under Serra had these churches with elaborate Baroque facades built in the heart of the Sierra Gorda. In addition to Conc√°, churches were built in Jalpan, Tancoyol, Landa and Tilaco. The facades are notable not only for their profuse decoration, but also for the appearance of a number of indigenous elements. The Conc√° mission is the smallest of the five, but between 1754 and 1758 by Jos√© Antonio de Murgu√≠a and Joaquin Fern√°ndez Osorio. It is dedicated to the Archangel Michael, with the theme of the facade being ‚ÄúThe Victory of the Faith.‚Äù It is considered to have the most indigenous elements, with many of its elements showing the more brusque work characteristic of indigenous decoration. More obvious is an image of the Holy Trinity at the crest, which is accompanied by a rabbit and a two-headed eagle, which are Pame symbols. Also prominent are the coat of arms of the Franciscan order, grapevines, two headed eagles, with the Virgin of Guadalupe and Our Lady of the Pillar, the patronesses of Mexico and Spain respectively. After the missions were turned over to secular clergy, many indigenous abandoned them, a process that would continue with the Mexican War of Independence and Mexican Revolution, when the churches all suffered deterioration and sacking. Restoration of the churches began starting in 1979 until the 2000s. The five where inscribed together as a World Heritage Site in 2003. History The town was originally known as the Presidio de Arroyo Seco, a military outpost. In 1833, missionary Francisco Cano Santander gave it the ecclesiastical name of Villa de Guadalupe which was the town's formal name until 1840, which it was changed to the current one. Its coat of arms has three parts. The first represents the Cross of the Holy Trinity with hands representing the indigenous peoples and the evangelizers. The second is the rabbit which appears on the facade of the mission church of Conc√°. This rabbit is the only one to appear on the five mission churches. The third is an arroyo from which the name comes. Double headed eagle on the Conc√° church Arroyo Seco is part of the heart of the Sierra Gorda. This region has been occupied for about 6000 years. In the Pre Classic and Classic periods, the Sierra Gorda had a number of small cities as the climate at that time was wetter than it is now. Most of the larger cities were south of the current municipalities due to mining activities and major trade routes, but there were cities and trade routes through here as well, connecting the area mostly with Huasteca areas to the east and other areas to the north. As the climate of the Sierra Gorda dried out in the early Post Classic period, cities were abandoned for simpler hunter gatherer communities and there were migrations of Chichimecas, mostly Pames and Chichimeca Jonaz from the north. Arroyo Seco would become Pame territory. In the late pre Hispanic period, the Sierra Gorda had incursions from both the Pur√©pecha and Aztecs from as early as 1400, attracted by the area's mineral deposits, but neither had true dominance as the Chichimecas fiercely opposed them. In the 15th century, the area was marginally dominated by the Oxitipa dominion, which was conquered by Moctezuma Ilhuicama and the Pames. This officially converted the area into an Aztec tributary state, but the Aztecs never truly had control. The Spanish made incursions into the Sierra Gorda early in the colonial period, but the Chichimeca, especially the Jonaz just to the south, put up fierce resistance to their intrusions. This would keep the Spanish from fully dominating the area for two hundred years. In 1532, Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n entered the Sierra Gorda and conquered it but did not hold it. From that time until the 18th century, there had been a number of missions established by the Franciscans and the Augustinians, but these missions were either destroyed by the Chichimecas or the population would flee from them and move into more inaccessible mountains and canyons. The first Spanish population in the Arroyo Seco area was in San Nicol√°s Conc√°, established as an encomienda under Pedro Guzm√°n between 1533 and 1538. This territory extended over much of the Sierra Gorda and into what is now San Luis Potos√≠. In 1587, Conc√° and Jalpan had missions established in them by the Augustinians from Xilitla. In 1601, friar Lucas de los √Ångeles from the Xich√∫ monastery preached in the area with limited success. In 1609, viceroy Luis de Velasco ordered that the Franciscans leave missionary work to the Augustinians, including the Arroyo Seco area. However, Franciscans from Michoac√°n stayed and worked with the Augustinians. Those who lasted longest in the area were those who learned the Pame language and learned to live with Pame customs. The Spanish would break Chichimeca resistance in the Sierra Gorda in the 1740s, with the expeditions of Jos√© de Escand√≥n, culminating in the Battle of Media Luna. To solidify these military gains, Franciscans founded new missions in this and other areas of northern Quer√©taro, the heart of the Sierra Gorda. These missions were taken over by Jun√≠pero Serra starting in 1750, who decided to have elaborate mission complexes built in five locations, one of which is in the municipality at Conc√°. In addition to evangelization, the missions worked to group the semi nomadic Pames into permanent communities centered on churches. There was one battle here during the Mexican Revolution when forces under General Saturnino Cedillo and Coronel Marcial Cevallos took over the Conc√° Hacienda in 1918. The town of Arroyo Seco itself was also attacked by General Cedillo, who killed many non-combatants, sacked and burned the town. In retaliation, forces loyal to Venustiano Carranza recruited soldiers from Arroyo Seco and defeated Cedillo at the Laguna de Conc√°. The town gained municipal status in 1933. At first the new municipality was governed by a committee headed by Antonio Rubio Ch√°vez but the first municipal president, C. Angel Torres Montes, was elected in 1935. In 1994, the municipality decided to build a garbage dump near the archeological zone of San Rafael without informing the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH). Since 2006, it has been known that the dump sits on the southern part of the site proper and that the digging of the dump site is estimated to have destroyed between eight and ten pyramids. More vestiges of the site lie 300 meters below the dump. The municipality promised for years to move the facility and from 2006, state and federal authorities have promised to replace it with a new one farther away. However, as of 2009, the dump is still operating taking on as much as forty tons of trash per week, as the new facility was not yet finished. In 2007, a smaller, above ground dump appeared in the same area, within sight of visible ruins. During this time, acids and other substances produced by the pit have probably caused damage to the limestone of the site, eating away at structures made of the substance. The site belongs to the R√≠o Verde Culture and its estimated to extend over 10km2. Its importance has been compared to that of Tamtoc in San Luis Potos√≠ . In 1998, forests in the municipality were among those in five states destroyed by wildfires. In total, 180 hectares were burned. The fires were due to freezing conditions in the prior winter which dried out grasslands. In the latter 2000s, the municipality has been struggling with water shortages due to drought conditions. The lack of water has caused the deaths of livestock and forced more people to emigrate from the municipality. Many communities now must rely on water trucked in from outside. As of 2007, sixteen out of forty six communities in the municipality have significant problems with water shortages. The government states that this is because a number of wells are drying up and there is insufficient distribution. In the second largest community of Pur√≠sima de Arista, about half of the residents experience water shortages. In 2009, the municipality had number of cases of cattle dying due to bites from ‚Äúvampire‚Äù bats which were transmitting a type of paralytic rabies. The bats were coming from caves located in neighboring Guanajuato. From the latter 2000s to the present, Arroyo Seco and the rest of the Sierra Gorda in Quer√©taro have been experiencing numerous small earthquakes, with most registering from 2.5 to 3.5 on the Richter scale, generally imperceptible to humans. Seismologists say that while the number has been unusual, such activity is not and is due to the settling of the sedimentary rock which is below most of the Sierra Gorda region. However, Arroyo Seco and other municipalities have seismographs installed to monitor the situation. The municipality's recent history also includes the mass migration out by many of its working aged people due to lack of economic opportunity. Most have gone to the United States with as much as forty percent of the municipality's population living in the country alone. The money that these workers send back home have significantly changed the local economy, as it is larger than the locally generated economy and larger than annual municipal budget. The migration has caused municipality schools, especially primary schools to lose students as they leave for the United States with their parents. In 2006, the municipality elected its first non-PRI municipal president since the Mexican Revolution, a former migrant worker by the name of Mariano Palacios Trejo, from the PRD . Construction of a military base was begun in early 2011 at a three hectare site. The base is one of three being built to work against drug trafficking and other crimes along the Quer√©taro/San Luis Potos√≠ border. This base is part of the 17th Military Zone to patrol the Quer√©taro-San Luis Potos√≠ border. The military is there to countering drug trafficking in the area as the region does not have the resources for local police forces. Economy and tourism The municipality is one of the most economically marginalized in the state, with the Secretar√≠a de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL) cataloging it as one of the 200 most socioeconomically marginalized in the country. This is the main reason why Arroyo Seco and other municipalities in the Sierra Gorda of Quer√©taro have high rates of emigration. It is not known exactly how many have left or how many come back at the end of the year to visit family, but Arroyo Seco estimates that about forty percent of its population is living somewhere in the United States. The amount sent back in remittances is also not known, but it has been estimated at between 50,000 and US$100,000 per day or about US$18 million per year to the Sierra Gorda alone, based on money exchanges made in the main city of Jalpan de Serra. This amount supersedes the annual municipal budget of Arroyo Seco and other area municipalities and generally superseded money generated by municipal economies. In Arroyo Seco, one in four homes is supported by dollars sent home by family in the United States. These migrants not only provide remittances directly to their families, they have also formed clubs with the purpose of promoting infrastructure projects in their home communities. The Club de Migrantes de la Sierra Gorda is an association of twenty seven of these clubs from various municipalities, with three from Arroyo Seco. Most of the projects are related paving, water distribution and sewerage/drainage. These dollars are often matched through a program sponsored by the Mexican federal government. Many businesses in the municipality and the rest of the Sierra Gorda take the dollar as currency, especially at the end of the year when many come to the area to visit family. Arroyo Seco has one of the highest rates of emigration in Quer√©taro. Arroyo Seco is one of the sponsors of the D√≠a del Paisano to honor returning migrant workers in Jalpan de Serra. This events includes parades and raffles. Because of this emigration, only 23.36% of the total population is economically active, mostly employed in traditional economic activities, such as agriculture, livestock, forestry and general commerce. About twenty percent of the total population works at home for no pay. Women make up only 22% of the paid workforce. Most of those who are not economically active are students and housewives. Most of the territory is used for pasture and forestry, with total about ninety percent. The rest is used for agriculture, most of which is done only during the rainy season. Just over 43% of the economically active are working agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishing. Thirty of the municipality's communities engage in agriculture to some degree with most of the production for self consumption. The soil is fertile although it is sometimes hard with some drainage problems. These problems are greatest where the topsoil is less than ten centimeters. One problem with agriculture here is that the soil erodes easily. Fruit trees include mango, oranges, limes, bananas, guavas, avocados and papaya. Other crops such as sugar cane, corn, beans, green chili peppers, cascabel chili peppers, tomatoes, watermelon, squash, chickpeas, sorghum, barley and pitahaya. Most livestock is raised in the communities of El Refugio, San Juan Buenaventura, La Florida, San Jos√© de la Flores, R√≠o de Carrizal, Ayutla, Salitrillo and Tepame. Most livestock is cattle with some sheep and goats. The forests of the municipality make up about sixteen percent of the state's forest resources and cover 54% of the municipality. Over eighty percent of the forest is made up solely of broad-leafed trees with most of the rest a mix of broad-leafed and conifers. Logging is limited because of the tropical hardwoods here and conservation efforts related to the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve, but it still makes up over 15% of the state's total. About 19% of the forested lands are used for grazing. Fish farming is a growing segment of the economy, especially in communities near rivers such as R√≠o del Carrizal, Conc√°, Vegas Cuatas and Ayutla. About 25% are working in mining, construction, utilities and manufacturing. Commerce, transportation and services employ about eighteen percent. There are about 140 people dedicated to commerce, most of which is small grocery stores. Supermarkets and other similar stores are located in neighboring San Luis Potos√≠ in R√≠o Verde and San Ciro. Tourism is a small percentage of the economy, mostly based on the mission church at Conc√° and some resort hotels opened in recent years. People also visit to see the 1000-year-old Montezuma Bald Cypress (Taxodium mucronatum), called the √Årbol Milenario or Millennium Tree. Its trunk has the second largest diameter in Mexico after the Tule tree in Oaxaca, requiring twenty two children linking hands to surround it. From its roots flows one of the fresh water springs of the community. During the colonial period, there were several haciendas in the municipality. One of these was San Nicol√°s de Conc√°, which still has abundant vegetation, a large fresh water spring and hiking trails. The main house has been converted into a hotel, conserving part of the original structure made of adobe, with rustic stairs, wooden roof beams and gardens. The San Nicolas Conca hotel has fifty rooms and is owned by an American by the name of Sharpton. The hacienda was originally dedicated to sugar cane and dates from the 18th century. The El Abanico water park has two swimming pools, a wading pool, restaurant and gardens and areas for camping. It is located next to the Conc√° Hacienda. The Hotel Ayutla water park has two swimming pools, three wading pools, sports fields, picnic areas, restaurant, gardens and areas to camp. Archeology The San Rafael site was first documented in 1939 by the Instituto Panamericano de Geograf√≠a e Historia. Some work was done on the site by archeologists such as Dominique Michelet for about a decade. This work determined that the site was occupied from 200 to 900 CE as a Mesoamerican city with temples, plazas, patios and residences located around four Mesoamerican ball courts. The city was a regional seat of government with strong Huasteca influence. It had a total of 250 buildings even larger than the better known sites of Las Ranas and Toluquilla . Eight to ten structures are considered destroyed and more may have suffered irreversible damage by acids eating way the limestone blocks. As of 2006, the limits of the sites have still not been defined. The vestiges of the site lie about three hundred meters below the dump. The site belongs to the R√≠o Verde Culture and its estimated to extend over 10km2. Its importance has been compared to that of Tamtoc in San Luis Potos√≠.

Although these wires are generally stiffer than a typical wire rope, they function mechanically the same as tensioned flexible wires, keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads. The term suspension wheel should not be confused with vehicle suspension. Wire wheels are used on most bicycles and are still used on many motorcycles. They were invented by aeronautical engineer George Cayley in 1808.In his notebook, dated March 19, 1808, Cayley proposed that in order to produce \\"the lightest possible wheel for aerial navigation cars,\\" one should \\"do away with wooden spokes altogether and refer the whole firmness of the wheel to the strength of the rim only, by the intervention of tight strong cording ‚Ä¶ \\" See: J.A.D.

Cayley's tension-spoke wheel appears on page 152, \\"3.7 The Tension Wheel, 1808\\". Although Cayley first proposed wire wheels, he did not apply for a patent. The first patent for wire wheels was issued to Theodore Jones of London, England on October 11, 1826.See: * Notice of Theodore Jones' patent for wire wheels: Repertory of patent inventions, etc., no. 17 (November 1826), page 320. * Illustrations and description of Jones' wire wheel: Luke Hebert, ed.

Bicycle wheels were not strong enough for cars until the development of tangentially spoked wheels. They rapidly became well established in the bicycle and motor tricycle world but were not common on cars until around 1907. This was encouraged by the Rudge-Whitworth patented detachable and interchangeable wheels designed by John Pugh. These wheels owed their resistance to braking and accelerative stresses to their two inner rows of tangential spokes. An outer row of radial spokes gave lateral strength against cornering stresses. These wheels were deeply dished so that steering pivot pins might lie as near as possible to the center-line of the tires. Their second feature was that they were easily detachable being mounted on splined false hubs. A process of assembling wire wheels is described as wheelbuilding. On automobiles From the earliest days automobiles used either wire wheels or heavy wooden or pressed steel spoked artillery type. The development of the quick detachable hubs of either Rudge-Whitworth or Riley design did much to popularise wire wheels and incidentally led to the fitting of \\"spare wheels\\". After their wooden spoked artillery wheels proved inadequate many US manufacturers paid John Pugh of Rudge-Whitworth royalties to manufacture wire wheels using his patents. Artillery wheels fell out of favour in the late 1920s and the development of the cheaper pressed steel wheels by Joseph Sankey replaced wire wheels wherever the premium price of wire wheels was not justified by their weight saving. 1929 Cadillac.jpgCadillac Chrysler.model77.750pix.jpgChrysler '29 Ford Model A (Auto classique Ste-Rose '11).JPGFord 1932 Lincoln 507 Sedan pic4.JPGLincoln 1929Packard645DualCowlPhaetonWheelBackLeft.jpgPackard File:1937 Rolls-Royce Phantom III Limousine (13451967025) (cropped).jpgRolls-Royce Phantom III 1937 high-quality centre-lock (wire) wheels streamlined by nave plates =Sports cars= Before 1960, sports/racing cars usually had Rudge-Whitworth centerlock wire wheels equipped with splined hubs and a quick-release \\"knockoff\\" (central wing nut) locking cap1.3.4 Wire wheels The center-lock wire wheel is traditionally associated with vintage sports cars and racing cars, and for those of us of advancing years the blood is still stirred by memories of split-seconds saved by the deft application of copper-headed hammers to eared hubcaps. We also remember... page 5, Colin Campbell New Directions in Suspension Design: Making the Fast Car Faster Taylor & Francis, 1981, USA. . that could be unscrewed by striking a wing of the nut with a special alloy mallet or \\"knockoff hammer\\". Some jurisdictions, including the United States and West Germany, prohibited eared hubcaps for safety reasons in the late 1960s. In response, some manufacturers (e.g. Maserati) preferred to hold the wheel on the splined hub by capping with a single conventional unwinged hex nut requiring a special large spanner. In the 1960s even lighter cast alloy wheels became usual‚Äîat first with splined hubs and knock-off caps‚Äîand now predominate. New versions of wire wheels are still made but often with standard hub bolt patterns covered by a center cap to fit without adapters.

They were introduced early on in the development of the bicycle, following soon after the adoption of solid rubber tires. This development marked a major improvement over the older wooden wheels, both in terms of weight and comfort (the increased elasticity of the wheel helping to absorb road vibrations). In England, the engineer William Stanley developed the steel-wired spider wheel in 1849, an improvement over the cumbersome wooden spoked wheels then fitted to the tricycles that his employer was making. Bicycle manufacturers build millions of wheels annually, using the common crossed-spoke patterns whose crossings of adjacent spokes are governed by the number of spokes in the wheel. Wheelbuilders of racing teams and in good bicycle shops build wheels to other patterns such as two-cross, one-cross, or no-cross (usually called radial). Many of these patterns have been used for more than 100 years, it is claimed that crossed patterns have more strength and stability while irregular patterns are art forms and have little structural merit. In the 1980s, cast wheels with 5 or 6 rigid spokes began to appear in the Olympic Games and professional racing: these have advantages in specialized applications, such as time trials, but wire-spoked wheels are used for most purposes. Reaction to load The reaction to a radial load of a well-tensioned wire spoked wheel, such as by a rider sitting on a bicycle, is that the wheel flattens slightly near the ground contact area. The rest of the wheel remains approximately circular. The tension of all the spokes does not increase significantly. Instead, only the spokes directly under the hub decrease their tension. The issue of how best to describe this situation is debated. Some authors conclude from this that the hub \\"stands\\" on those spokes immediately below it that experience a reduction in tension, even though the spokes below the hub exert no upward force on the hub and can be replaced by chains without much changing the physics of the wheel. Other authors conclude that the hub \\"hangs\\" from those spokes above it that exert an upward force on the hub, and that have higher tension than the spokes below the hub, which pull down on the hub. Despite being composed of thin and relatively flexible spokes, wire wheels are radially stiff and provide very little suspension compliance compared to even high-pressure bicycle tires.

Wheels ","title":"Wire wheel"},{"id":"4334418","text":"\\"The Complexity of Songs\\" is a journal article published by computer scientist Donald Knuth in 1977, as an in-joke about computational complexity theory. The article capitalizes on the tendency of popular songs to devolve from long and content-rich ballads to highly repetitive texts with little or no meaningful content.Steven Krantz (2005) \\"Mathematical Apocrypha Redux\\", , pp.2, 3. The article notes that a song of length N words may be produced remembering, e.g., only words (\\"space complexity\\" of the song).  Article summary  Knuth writes that \\"our ancient ancestors invented the concept of refrain\\" to reduce the space complexity of songs, which becomes crucial when a large number of songs is to be committed to one's memory. Knuth's Lemma 1 states that if N is the length of a song, then the refrain decreases the song complexity to cN, where the factor c < 1. Reprinted in: Knuth further demonstrates a way of producing songs with O(sqrt N) complexity, an approach \\"further improved by a Scottish farmer named O. MacDonald\\". More ingenious approaches yield songs of complexity O(log N), a class known as \\"m bottles of beer on the wall\\". Finally, the progress during the 20th century‚Äîstimulated by the fact that \\"the advent of modern drugs has led to demands for still less memory\\"‚Äîleads to the ultimate improvement: Arbitrarily long songs with space complexity O(1) exist, e.g. a song defined by the recurrence relation :S_0=epsilon, S_k = V_kS_{k-1},, kge 1, :V_k = 'That's the way,' U 'I like it,' U, for all k ge 1 :U= 'uh huh,' 'uh huh'  Further developments  Prof. Kurt Eisemann of San Diego State University in his letter to the Communications of the ACM further improves the latter seemingly unbeatable estimate. He begins with an observation that for practical applications the value of the \\"hidden constant\\" c in the Big Oh notation may be crucial in making the difference between the feasibility and unfeasibility: for example a constant value of 1080 would exceed the capacity of any known device. He further notices that a technique has already been known in Mediaeval Europe whereby textual content of an arbitrary tune can be recorded basing on the recurrence relation S_k = C_2S_{k-1}, where C_2 = 'la', yielding the value of the big-Oh constant c equal to 2. However it turns out that another culture achieved the absolute lower bound of O(0). As Prof. Eisemann puts it: > \\"When the Mayflower voyagers first descended on these shores, the native > Americans proud of their achievement in the theory of information storage > and retrieval, at first welcomed the strangers with the complete silence. > This was meant to convey their peak achievement in the complexity of songs, > namely the demonstration that a limit as low as c = 0 is indeed obtainable.\\" However the Europeans were unprepared to grasp this notion, and the chiefs, in order to establish a common ground to convey their achievements later proceeded to demonstrate an approach described by the recurrent relation S_k = C_1S_{k-1}, where C_1 = 'i', with a suboptimal complexity given by c = 1.Kurt Eisemann, \\"Further Results on the Complexity of Songs\\", Communications of the ACM, vol 28 (1985), no. 3, p. 235. The O(1) space complexity result was also implemented by Guy L. Steele, Jr., perhaps challenged by Knuth's article.Peter G. Neumann, \\"A further view of the first quarter century\\" ,Communications of the ACM, Volume 27, Issue 4, April 1984, p. 343 Dr. Steele's TELNET Song used a completely different algorithm based on exponential recursion, a parody on some implementations of TELNET.Guy L.

Arizonasaurus is found in the Middle Triassic Moenkopi Formation of northern Arizona. A fairly complete skeleton was found in 2002 by Sterling Nesbitt. The taxon has a large sailback formed by elongated neural spines of the vertebrae. The type species, Arizonasaurus babbitti, was named by Samuel Paul Welles in 1947. Discovery and naming The type species, Arizonasaurus babbitti, was named by Samuel Paul Welles in 1947 on the basis of a few teeth and a maxilla, labelled as specimen UCMP 36232. A fairly complete skeleton was found in 2002 by Sterling Nesbitt. Description Restoration Arizonasaurus had a sail made of tall neural spines. This sail was similar to those of other basal archosaurs, such as other ctenosauriscids like Ctenosauriscus, Lotosaurus, Bromsgroveia, and Hypselorhachis. Arizonasaurus is described from two braincase specimens. Some ancestral features of these braincases are plesiomorphic for crurotarsans. Below is a list of characteristics found by Nesbitt in 2005 that distinguish Arizonasaurus: *a deep fossa hidden from view on the posteroventral edge of the upward-pointing process of the maxilla; *and a tongue-groove attachment between the pubis and the ilium. Classification Arizonasaurus was closely related to Ctenosauriscus; and, together with a few other genera, they make up Ctenosauriscidae. The ctenosauriscids were closely related to the poposaurids, as shown by a few shared derived characteristics. The pelvic girdle in Arizonasaurus unites this taxon with Ctenosauriscus, Lotosaurus, Bromsgroveia, and Hypselorhachus. Together, newly identified pseudosuchian features act as evidence that poposaurids, such as Poposaurus, Sillosuchus, and Chatterjeea, and ctenosauriscids form a monophyletic group that is derived rauisuchians. Below is a phylogenetic cladogram simplified from Butler et al. in 2011 showing the cladistics of Archosauriformes, focusing mostly on Pseudosuchia: Biogeography Arizonasaurus is from the middle Triassic Moenkopi Formation of northern Arizona. The presence of a poposauroid in the early Middle Triassic suggests that the divergence of birds and crocodiles occurred earlier than previously thought. Ctenosauriscids from the Middle Triassic allow the distribution of Triassic faunas to be more widespread, now in Europe, Asia, North America and Africa. The fauna of the Moenkopi Formation represents a stage transitional fauna between the faunas of older and younger age.

A thermoscope is a device that shows changes in temperature. A typical design is a tube in which a liquid rises and falls as the temperature changes. The modern thermometer gradually evolved from it with the addition of a scale in the early 17th century and standardisation through the 17th and 18th centuries.  Function  Principle of thermoscope. Higher temperature expands the air in the bulb and lowers the level in the tube.Same quantity of the represented liquid (condition)and its levels outside of the tube should not be the same (representation error) Devices employing both heat and pressure were common during Galileo's time, used for fountains, nursing, or bleeding in medicine. The device was built from a small vase filled with water, attached to a thin vertically rising pipe, with a large empty glass ball at the top. Changes in temperature of the upper ball would exert positive or vacuum pressure on the water below, causing it to rise or lower in the thin column. The device established fixed points but does not measure specific quantity, although it can tell when something is warmer than another thing. Essentially, thermoscopes served as a justification of sorts regarding what is observed or experienced by the senses - that the device's basic agreement with the indications of the senses generates initial confidence in its reliability. Large thermoscopes placed outdoors appeared to cause perpetual motion of contained water, and these were therefore sometimes called perpetuum mobile. Galileo's own work with the thermoscope led him to develop an essentially atomistic conception of heat, published in his book Il Saggiatore in 1623. History It is confirmed that Galileo Galilei discovered the specific principle on which the device is based and invented the first thermoscope in 1593. Galileo mentioned to his friend Cesare Marsili that he invented a thermoscope as far back as 1606. The inventor could be his physician friend Santorio Santorio or another person of the learned circle in Venice of which they were members. What is certain is that the thermoscope has started circulating in market squares during Galileo's time. The development of the actual device is attributed to four inventors namely, Galileo, Santorio Santorio, Robert Fludd, and Cornelius Drebbel. However, the general pneumatic principle of the thermoscope was used in the Hellenic period, and it was written about even earlier, by Empedocles of Agrigentum in his 460 B.C. book On Nature. Santorio Santorio wrote a Commentary on the Medical Art of Galen in 1612 that described the device in print. Shortly afterward, in 1617 Giuseppe Biancani published the first clear diagram. The device at this time could not be used for quantitative or standardized measurement and used the temperature of air to expand or contract gas, thereby moving a column of water. It was Drebbel who announced in the early 17th century one of the earliest or possibly the first prototype, which was filled with air and blocked by water containing a little aqua fortis to prevent it from freezing and being discolored. The device was improved by early German scientist Otto von Guericke in the 17th century. Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany personally made a further improvement by introducing the use of a colored alcohol, so that the material responding to heat was now liquid instead of gas. It is possible that Francesco Sagredo or Santorio may have added some kind of scales to thermoscopes, and Robert Fludd may have accomplished something similar in 1638.J. E. Drinkwater (1832)Life of Galileo Galilei page 41The Galileo Project: Santorio Santorio In 1701 Ole Christensen R√∏mer effectively invented the thermometer by adding a temperature scale (see R√∏mer scale) to the thermoscope.

Luyt claims inspiration by Guillaume Faye's works in the Nouvelle Droite movement. The youth wing of Bloc Identitaire, called in France G√©n√©ration identitaire, or Generation Identity, expanded to other European states soon after its creation in 2012, including Generazione Identitaria in Italy and Identit√§re Bewegung in Germany and Austria.https://iboesterreich.at Other youth wings are also present in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Belgium, Slovenia, Hungary, and the United Kingdom and Ireland. The movement has been widely considered neo-fascist, although Les Identitaires does not consider itself as such.  Ideology  It opposes \\"imperialism, whether it be American or Islamic,\\" and supports the far-right Great Replacement conspiracy theory. The Bloc Identitaire runs the agency and website Novopress, that has associates in most of Western Europe and North America.Ludovic Finez, ¬´ Les \\"infos\\" x√©nophobes de Novopress ¬ª, 27 July 2005.  Novopress  Novopress presents itself as an \\"international news agency\\" founded by Fabrice Robert, a leader of the French nationalist organization Bloc Identitaire. Among its managers is Guillaume Luyt, former leader of the Front national de la jeunesse.

Novopress had 13 national editions in Europe and North America, including in Ireland, Italy and France. Logo of Novopress  Controversies  The Bloc Identitaire has been accused of intentionally distributing several popular soups containing pork in order to exclude religious Jews or Muslims; in Strasbourg, Nice, Paris, and in Antwerp with the association Antwerpse Solidariteit close to the Vlaams Belang. These so-called \\"identity soups\\" (\\"soupes identitaires\\") have been forbidden by the prefecture of the Haut-Rhin in Strasbourg on 21 January 2006, and called \\"discriminatory and xenophobic\\" by MEP Catherine Trautmann (PS) in a 19 January 2006 letter to the High authority for the struggle against discrimination and for equality (HALDE). This ethno-regionalist movement has also organised a campaign against the rap group Sniper in 2003, which was taken up by the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), leading to the cancellation of several concerts of the band. UMP deputy Nadine Morano interpolated Interior Minister (UMP) Nicolas Sarkozy on this theme, while 200 UMP deputies, led by Fran√ßois Grosdidier, tried without success to censor several hip-hop bands. Sarkozy criticized the hip-hop group as \\"ruffians who dishonour France.\\" In 2004, the Bloc Identitaire also organized a campaign against Italian writer Cesare Battisti, one-time member of the terrorist group Armed Proletarians for Communism, who was wanted in Italy for an assassination carried out during the Years of Lead, in which he denies responsibility. Battisti accused the \\"cell of the Italian embassy\\" of having \\"financed\\" the Bloc identitaire's campaign against him (in Ma Cavale, p. 160). Battisti was convicted to life sentence in his homeland for a total of 36 charges, including participation on four murders. The French government would subsequently decide to extradite him to Italy, but Battisti escaped to Brazil where he was granted political asylum. In 2010, they staged a protest in \\"resistance to the Islamization of France\\" at the Arc de Triomphe (relocated from an earlier planned site in Goutte-d'Or) where people would eat pork and drink grape juice or wine. In November 2012 the Generation Identitaire, the youth wing of the BI, occupied the mosque in Poitiers, the site where Charles Martel defeated an invading Muslim Moorish force in 732. In June 2018, Facebook banned Generation Identity for violating its policies against extremist content and hate groups. In December 2018, Al Jazeera produced a documentary entitled \\"Generation Hate\\" featuring an undercover journalist who had infiltrated Generation Identitaire. The documentary included undercover footage of Generation Identitaire members in the northern French city of Lille racially abusing and assaulting migrant youths, advocating violence against Muslims, and alleged linkages between Generation Identitaire and Front National. Generation Identitaire's actions were condemned by Mayor of Lille Martine Aubry and Prefect of the North Michele Lalande, who advocated prosecuting offenders for inciting hatred and closing down La Citadelle, which served as a meeting place for location Generation Identitaire members in Lille. Prosecutor Thierry Pocquet Haut-Juss√© has also announced an investigation by the Central Directorate of Public Security into the activities of the Generation Identitaire members. On 11 July 2019, Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the country's domestic intelligence agency, formally designated the Identitarian Movement as \\"a verified extreme right movement against the liberal democratic constitution.\\" The new classification will allow the BfV to use more powerful surveillance methods against the group and its youth wing, Generation Identity. The Identitarian Movement has about 600 members in Germany.Croucher, Shane (11 July 2019) \\"Identitarian Movement, Linked to Christchurch Mosque Shooter, Classified as Extremist Right-wing Group by German Intelligence Agency\\" Newsweek Lawsuit In August 2019, a French court sentenced three members of Generation Identity to a six-month jail term, fines of ‚Ç¨2,000 each and loss of civic rights for five years, and fined the pan-European organisation ‚Ç¨75,000, over an anti-immigrant operation in the Alps. Generation Identity president Cl√©ment Gandelin, spokesman Romain Espino and Damien Lef√®vre were found guilty of \\"exercising activities in conditions that could create confusion with a public function\\". The case was that the operation, involving about 100 of their members at the Col de l'√âchelle in April 2018, could have been mistaken for a police action.

The street runs Northwest from the central Manege Square in the direction of Saint Petersburg and terminates at the Garden Ring, giving the name to Tverskoy District. The route continues further as First Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, Leningradsky Avenue and Leningradskoye Highway.  History and architecture  =Middle Ages to 18th century= Tourists are told that Tverskaya Street existed as early as the 12th century. Its importance for the medieval city was immense, as it connected Moscow with its superior, and later chief rival, Tver. At that time, the thoroughfare crossed the Neglinnaya River. The first stone bridge across the Neglinnaya was set up in 1595. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Tverskaya Street was renowned as the centre of Moscow's social life. The nobility considered it fashionable to settle in this district. Among the Palladian mansions dating from the reign of Catherine the Great are the residence of the mayor of Moscow (1778‚Äì82, rebuilt in ), and the English Club (1780s). The mayor's residence among a number of other historic buildings was moved about 14 meters for the widening of the Gorky Street during Stalin's time. On the square before it stands a statue of the legendary founder of Moscow, Yuri Dolgoruky, erected for the city's 800th anniversary.Gruliow, L.: Moscow. Time Life Books, 1978. During the imperial period, the importance of the thoroughfare was highlighted by the fact that it was through this street that the tsars arrived from the Northern capital to stay at their Kremlin residence. Several triumphal arches were constructed to commemorate coronation ceremonies. In 1792, the Tverskaya Square was laid out before the residence of the governor of Moscow as a staging ground for mass processions and parades. In 1947, the square was decorated with an equestrian statue of Prince Yury Dolgoruky, founder of Moscow. =19th century= A bystreet, Gazetny Lane, with Central Telegraph Building on the left. This side street figures prominently in the novel Anna Karenina During Pushkin's time, the Tverskaya was lined with five churches. The poet wove his impressions from the street into the following stanza of Eugene Onegin: Towards the end of the 19th century, the street was reconstructed, with stately neoclassical mansions giving way to grandiose commercial buildings in an eclectic mixture of historical styles. A characteristic edifice of the time is the eclectic Hotel National, Moscow (1901-1903), whose interior is a landmark of Russian Art Nouveau. In 1888 the actor, theatre director and founder of the Moscow Art Theatre, Constantin Stanislavski, rented the Ginzburg House on the street and had it converted into a luxurious clubhouse with its own large stage and several exhibition rooms, in order to house his newly formed Society of Art and Literature.Benedetti (1999, 27). The Society gave its last performance there on 3 January 1891 and the building burnt down on the night of January 10.Benedetti (1999, 42). =Modern history= 6, Tverskaya: 1940 building by 250x250px ... hides the magnificent Savvinskoye Podvorie Between the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the rise of Stalinist architecture in mid-1930s, the street acquired three modernist buildings - constructivist Izvestia Building by Grigory Barkhin (1925‚Äì1927, Pushkin Square), Central Telegraph Building (1927-29, 7 Tverskaya), a modernist masterpiece by Ivan Rerberg, and a stern \\"black cube\\" of the Lenin Institute in Tverskaya Square (1926) by Stepan Chernyshyov. The street was renamed in 1932 for Maxim Gorky, the Russian writer and revolutionary admired by both Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin.Parks, Michael. \\"Gorky Street Loses Name as Muscovites Reach for Past\\", Los Angeles Times (July 29, 1990). Further expansion occurred in line with Joseph Stalin's 1935 master plan. During that period, all the churches and most other historic buildings were torn down in order to widen the street and replace low-rise buildings with larger, early Stalinist apartment blocks and government offices. Arkady Mordvinov, who handled this ambitious project, retained some historical buildings, like the ornately decorated Savvinskoye Podvorye by Ivan Kuznetsov. This building was moved to a new foundation North from the new street line, and is now completely enclosed inside Mordvinov's Stalinist block at 6, Tverskaya Street. The project was only partially completed before World War II; more Stalinist blocks appeared in the 1940s and 1950s, still leaving a lot of 19th-century buildings. Most of them were torn down later, with a few exceptions like Yermolova Theatre still standing. Hotel Intourist, a 22-story tower built in 1970, was demolished in 2002 and replaced by the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Moscow. When Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power, he encouraged a return to the country's old Russian names. Thus, the street's name became \\"Tverskaya Street\\" again, after a 55-year interlude as Gorky Street.  Layout and functions  Tverskaya Street runs from the Manege Square through the Tverskoy District and the crossing with the Boulevard Ring, known as Pushkin Square, to the Garden Ring. Its extension, First Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, continues further on Northwest right up to Belorussky Rail Terminal (Tverskaya Zastava Square), changing its name again into Leningradsky Prospekt. It keeps the same direction before diverging into Volokolamskoye Shosse and Leningradskoye Shosse (Leningrad Highway). Tverskaya Street is the most expensive shopping street in Moscow and Russia. According to an index published by global real estate company Colliers International in 2008, it is now the third most expensive street in the world, based on commercial rental fees. It is the center of the city's nightlife and entertainment.  Reconstruction plan, 2007-2009  Plans for the reconstruction of the Tverskaya radius into a grade-separated freeway, already under way in remote parts of the route (see Leningradsky Prospekt Reconstruction for a complete schedule), have been authorized for Tverskaya Zastava and Pushkin Square in April, 2007, to be completed in 2009. Work is already underway at the first location. Both squares will acquire complex multi-level, grade-separated crossings and underground shopping malls, despite objections from preservationists and traffic experts.

Chapman (living status unknown), who is credited in comics under both his formal name and as Hank Chapman,Page 1 credit at is an American comic book writer for Marvel Comics' two predecessors, Timely Comics and Atlas Comics, and later for DC Comics, where he specialized in war fiction. Though much of his Timely/Atlas work went unsigned, comics historians estimate that Chapman, a staff writer, penned several hundred or more stories. Among Chapman's works is an early self-reflexive comic-book story, in 1951, in which he and editor Stan Lee appear; and the creation, with artist Jack Abel, of the DC Comics character Sgt. Mule, a pack animal that helped its Allied keepers fight the Nazis in a variety of World War II stories. Career Chapman's earliest known credit is as one of the many Golden Age of comic books professionals who contributed to the epic crossover battle between the Sub- Mariner and the original Human Torch in Marvel Mystery Comics #8‚Äì10 (June‚ÄìAug. 1940), plus an additional story in The Human Torch No. 5 (Fall 1941; due to a numbering quirk, there was a previous No. 5, cover-dated Summer 1941). His precise contributions are as lost to history as those of other writers and artists who legendarily collaborated on this hastily created confrontation. As described by historian Jess Nevins, Sub-Mariner creator Bill Everett and Human Torch creator Carl Burgos... Stan Lee and Hank Chapman appear as versions of themselves in Chapman's four-page story \\"The Nightmare\\" (Astonishing No. 4, June 1951). Art by either Wayne Boring or Al Plastino (sources differ). By the following decade, Chapman was one of at least five staff writers (officially titled editors) under editor-in-chief Stan Lee at Marvel forerunner Atlas, along with Ernie Hart, Paul S. Newman, Don Rico, Carl Wessler, and, on teen- humor comics, future Mad Magazine cartoonist Al Jaffee. Among the titles for which Chapman wrote, beginning in early 1951, are the horror/fantasy series Adventures into Terror, Adventures into Weird Worlds, Astonishing, Marvel Tales, Mystery Tales, Spellbound, Strange Tales, Suspense, and Uncanny Tales; the war titles Battle, Battle Action, Battlefield, Battlefront, Battle Brady, Combat Casey, Combat, War Action, War Adventures, War Combat and War Comics; the Westerns Red Warrior and The Texas Kid; the adventure-drama series Girl Comics, Man Comics, Men's Adventures, and Young Men; the crime fiction series Crime Exposed and Justice; the romance titles True Secrets Love Romances; and such miscellanea as Sports Action, and Speed Carter, Spaceman.Hank Chapman and Henry P. Chapman at the Grand Comics Database. Chapman's last known Atlas works were in comics cover-dated May 1954. His next known credit is a story in the DC anthology title All-American Men of War No. 18 (Feb. 1955), followed by four years without recorded credits until his name surfaced in two June 1959 DC titles, G.I. Combat No. 73 and Our Fighting Forces No. 46. These would be the first of at least 105 war stories he would write in those comics along with Our Army at War, Sea Devils, Capt. Storm, and Star Spangled War Stories. His and artist Jack Abel's character Sgt. Mule ‚Äì whose name, \\"Millie\\", meant she was actually not a mule (male) but a hinny (female) ‚Äî appeared with various keepers including Private Mulvaney (Our Army at War No. 149 & 160, Star Spangled War Stories #136); Private Skinner (G.I. Combat #104); and Private Smith (Our Army at War #117). Chapman's last recorded credit is the story \\"Paper Bullets\\", with artist Abel, in Our Army at War No. 181 (June 1967).

It serves a largely residential area. History Waterloo opened in 1848 as the original terminus of the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway. In 1850, the line was extended to Liverpool Exchange. It became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR), on 14 June 1855, which took over from the (LCSR). The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 and in turn was Grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Nationalisation followed in 1948 and in 1978 the station became part of the Merseyrail network's Northern Line (operated by British Rail until privatisation in 1995). Facilities The station is staffed 15 minutes before the first service and 15 minutes after the last service. There is platform CCTV, shelters and a booking office. There are departure and arrival screens on the platform for passenger information. The station has secure storage for 30 cycles. The station is fully wheelchair accessible: access to the platforms is via steps or a lift from the ticket office, or via ramped walkway from the bus interchange across the road. Services Trains run to Southport (northbound) and Liverpool Central and Hunts Cross (southbound) at 15 minute frequencies Monday-Saturday (first train to Southport 0609, last train 2354, first train to Hunts Cross 0610, last train 2325, later train to Liverpool Central 2343).

Like the SP-202, the SP-303 utilizes 8 pads, 4 soundbanks, and an external mic. The sampler provides up to three minutes and twelve seconds of sampling. The sample time can be expanded by the use of SmartMedia cards (8MB-64MB supported). The SP-303 features twenty-six internal effects that can be applied to samples and external sources as well. Some of these affects are Filter + Drive, Pitch, Delay, Vinyl Sim, Isolator, Reverb, and Tape Echo. Another notable feature is the built-in pattern sequencer, where loops and patterns can be programmed. Musicians The SP-303 is often praised by various musicians for its unique sound qualities. Frequent SP-303 and 404 user Dibiase said of the sampler, \\"The difference between the 303 and SP-404 is that the vinyl sound compression sounds way different in the 303.

The station has block programming, mostly jazz and blues during the daytime, Americana in the late afternoon, and rock programming at night, but also playing alternative country, world music, and electronica. History The station began life in 1967 as a student organization broadcasting to the dormitories at NMC as a carrier-current station. The move to become an FM station was started by NMC students Tod Redfern, Wayne Niebroski, Malcolm Brooks, and Dennis Panagopoulus in 1976. In 1979, WNMC made its FM debut at 90.9, broadcasting at a mere 10 watts, and in 1981, they boosted power again to 150 watts, covering Traverse City and approximately six miles radius of surrounding territory. In 1997, WNMC boosted their power once more to 600 watts and moved to its current frequency, 90.7. The station now broadcasts from the relay tower of WPBN-TV 7 & 4, Traverse City's NBC station. The station is supported by student activity fees, listener donations and business underwriting. Northwestern Michigan College supplies bookkeeping and fundraising as well as a space to operate from. The annual budget is approximately $90,000. Staff WNMC is staffed mostly community volunteers ranging in age from 16 to 70+, from all over its service area. One of the station's jazz programs was once hosted by WPBN news anchor Dave Walker, who started his radio career at WKLA in Ludington, Michigan in the 1960s. Ben Hamper author of Rivethead currently hosts two programs on the station: Soul Possession (soul & funk), 9‚Äì11pm Fridays and Head for the Hills (hillbilly obscurities) 10‚Äìnoon on Sunday. Astronomer, NASA Ambassador, and former station manager Michael Foerster hosts a science feature on the Friday morning show circa 7:15am. The station's only employee is Eric Hines. Eric was a journalist prior to being recruited for the position. His previous experience in radio was with WRSU-FM on the station's Radio Council. Eric is responsible for almost all the functions of the station. He even is heard on the air several times a week. In cheese circles Hines is famous for inventing Stringburger, a string cheese variant of the famed, pungent Limburger. In recent years, the station added a morning show, hosted by Peter Strong, General Manager Eric Hines, Diane Hines, Dave Gault and several other community volunteers. Strong previously worked in northern Michigan radio in the early 80s and worked in Colorado not too long ago. The program is a mixture of news, music and chat. The station has recently begun automated broadcasts from 2 to 6am, and now generally broadcasts 24 hours a day.  Programming  WNMC broadcasts a wide variety of music, most of it otherwise unavailable on the radio dial in its service area. Jazz, blues, alternative rock, folk, world music and local music are primary areas of concentration. Specialty shows feature new age, alternative country, African, Latin American, and a host of other style and genres.

He was noted mostly for his etchings and drypoints published at the height of the print boom in the 1920s during the etching revival, but was also a lithographer, caricaturist, cartoonist, book illustrator and artist in oils, watercolours, silhouettes and bronze.  Early years  Edmund Blampied was born on a farm in the Parish of Saint Martin, Jersey in the Channel Islands on 30 March 1886, five days after the death of his father, John Blampied. He was the last of four boys and was brought up by his mother, Elizabeth, a dressmaker and shopkeeper mostly in the Parish of Trinity, Jersey. His first language was J√®rriais. He finished parochial school at the age of 14 and went to work in the office of the town architect in Saint Helier, the capital of the island. Some of his pen and ink sketches of an agricultural show in May 1902 were noticed by Mlle Marie Josephine Klintz, a woman who ran a local private art school. She gave the young Blampied his first formal lessons in art and introduced him to watercolours. His caricatures of politicians such as the Constable of St. Helier, Philippe Baudains, during a local election brought Blampied to the attention of a businessman named Saumerez James Nicolle who offered to sponsor him at art school in London, provided he tried to get a scholarship.  Art school  In January 1903, aged 16 years old and barely able to speak English, Blampied left Jersey to study at the Lambeth School of Art, where he was taught by Philip Connard R.A. and Thomas McKeggie. After taking a test and submitting some drawings, in May 1904 Blampied won a ¬£20 London County Council (LCC) Scholarship for two years to continue his studies at any LCC art school. Later that year he was selected by the head of the Art School to work part-time on the staff of a national newspaper, The Daily Chronicle, which enabled him to earn some extra money. His first published illustrations appeared in The Daily Chronicle on 13 January 1905. In September 1905 Blampied transferred from the Lambeth School of Art to the London County Council School of Photo-engraving and Lithography at Bolt Court for the final year of his scholarship. There he became friends with the artists and illustrators Salomon van Abbe, John Nicolson and Robert Charles Peter. It is believed that, after finishing full- time studies at Bolt Court in the summer of 1906, he continued to work at The Daily Chronicle and then perhaps at other newspapers while studying in the evenings at Bolt Court, though very little is known about this period in his life.  Etching  Blampied‚Äôs earliest etchings are dated December 1909, suggesting that he did not begin to learn this technique until the academic year 1909‚Äì1910; his teacher at Bolt Court was Walter Seymour. Blampied‚Äôs prints were first shown at an exhibition of students' work in March 1914, where his etching of an ox cart was noted by the correspondent of The Times.The Times, 17 March 1914, page 5. The first print believed to have been published was an etching entitled At the wings (illustration removed) which was reproduced in the Annual Report of Bolt Court in 1914. Blampied later recorded his method of working on zinc for etching and copper for drypoint in Ernest Stephen Lumsden's treatise The Art of Etching, published in 1925. Blampied wrote: \\"I generally chose from amongst my various drawings one which would tend to produce a successful plate. I do not trace on to the copper, but copy a few important lines on to the bare metal with litho-chalk. I then sketch over this with an ordinary sewing needle and rub in a little black oil- colour. . . From the first my efforts are to improve on the sketch until I consider the plate finished. . . In very few cases do I touch a plate after the first proof, so the majority have but one state. If I am dissatisfied with either the composition or details, I prefer to start afresh upon another plate rather than make radical alterations.\\"Lumsden, E.S. (1925). The Art of Etching. London: Seeley Service.  Independent artist  At the end of 1911, while he was developing his skills as an etcher, Blampied decided to try his luck as an independent artist with his own studio. The rapid developments in colour printing and the advertisers of the time were creating a great deal of work for commercial artists for book and magazine publishers in London. The first recorded illustration was for a piece of sheet music entitled Glamour Valse, published in 1911 by Ascherberg, Hopwood and Crew. Blampied quickly gained commissions to provide drawings for Pearson's Magazine, The Sketch, The Sphere, The Ladies Field, The Queen and The Graphic, many of which were signed \\"Blam\\", a diminutive first recorded in The Tatler in January 1916. He used this diminutive for much of his commercial work for books and magazines, including three children's books for the Edinburgh publisher Thomas Nelson and Sons, Blam's Book of Fun, The Jolly ABC, and The Breezy Farm ABC, all published in 1921, and for much of his work for Pearson's Magazine, Hutchinson's Magazine, The Bystander, and The Sketch between 1916 and 1939. Blampied‚Äôs etchings were brought to the attention of the art dealers and publishers Ernest Brown and Phillips of the Leicester Galleries in London through an introduction from H. Granville Fell, an artist and art editor. The Leicester Galleries offered Blampied a contract and three prints were shown to the general public in February 1915 in the first of a series of exhibitions of prints called Modern Masters of Etching. Blampied's most famous print, called Driving home in the rain, which had been designed in 1913 and transferred to a zinc plate in 1914, was not shown at the Leicester Galleries until November 1916 where, according to a Jersey newspaper of that time, it received a great deal of attention and admiration. On 5 August 1914 Edmund Blampied married Marianne van Abbe (b Amsterdam 27 August 1887, d Jersey 11 May 1986) who was the sister of Dutch-born artists Joseph and Salomon van Abbe. They had no children. Marianne had acted as his agent for several years before they married, and continued to do so until Edmund's brother John began working as an artist's agent in the 1920s. She was a great support to Blampied in his work and prompted him to travel and see the world.  Military service  When conscription was introduced in Britain in 1916, Blampied returned to Jersey in the autumn of that year to be prepared to be called up for military service. In June 1917 he was classified as not fully fit for active service and was put on guard duties in the Royal Jersey Militia. Although there was a gap in commissions for illustrations while he settled into military life, by early 1918 he had re-established his connections with the Scottish book publishers Thomas Nelson and Sons of Edinburgh, for whom he illustrated many children‚Äôs books and annuals during and immediately after the war.Hall, A. (1999). Edmund Blampied's illustrations for books published by Thomas Nelson and Sons. Annual Bulletin of the Soci√©t√© Jersiaise vol 27, no 3, 410-425. Blampied quickly re- established himself in London in September 1919 after his return from Jersey and his etchings were acknowledged by the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers who elected him an Associate in March 1920 at the same time as the wood engraver Gwen Raverat.Newbolt, F. (1930). The History of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers 1880-1930. London: The Print Collectors' Club. He was elevated to the full fellowship a year later. Blampied was elected at the end of what has been called the \\"etching revival\\", but there was still a strong market for prints, mainly as an inexpensive investment in art. In October 1920 Blampied held his first solo exhibition of 28 etchings and drypoints at the Leicester Galleries, many of which were prints that had been held back because of the war. Driving home in the rain was shown but the copy had been lent, suggesting that all proofs had been sold. His first exhibition of drawings and etchings in the US was held at Kennedy and Company in New York in early 1922.  Gold medal at 1925 Paris exposition  Blampied had started to experiment with lithography in 1920, as two lithographs were shown at his first solo exhibition, but they had been transferred to a lithographers' stone from paper, and he wanted to learn how to draw directly onto the stone. Blampied turned to Archibald Hartrick, a founder member of the Senefelder Club of lithographers, who was teaching at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, and started evening classes there.Hall, A.(2010). Edmund Blampied. An Illustrated Life. Companion bibliography. Jersey: Jersey Heritage. His early efforts, as with etching, proved to be very successful, especially a print named Splash, splash which caught the eye of the art critic Malcolm Salaman. Salaman included it in 1923 in the first of a long-running series of annual volumes called Fine Prints of the Year, which included examples of Blampied‚Äôs work each year between 1923 and 1937. In 1925 the Central School of Arts and Crafts submitted two of Blampied‚Äôs lithographs with the work of other students to the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, the exhibition that gave rise to the term ‚ÄúArt Deco‚Äù. The School won a Grand Prix for its works on paper and Blampied was one of 12 students who were awarded a Gold Medal as a collaborateur. In 1924, having been inspired by an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries of models in wax by Degas, Blampied produced his only bronzes: Kicking horse, in an edition of 15, and Homewards evening (edition unknown). Blampied held another major exhibition of his work, also at the Leicester Galleries, in March 1925 where he showed eight etchings, 25 paintings and 18 drawings, but his bronzes do not seem to have been shown at an exhibition until 1929. \\"An officer and a gentleman\\", an illustration from The Bystander in 1926  Illustrations for books and magazines  While developing his skills as an etcher and lithographer in the early 1920s Blampied continued to work extensively for magazines and contributed hundreds of political cartoons and decorative drawings to The Bystander magazine between 1922 and 1926; he illustrated short stories by E.F. Benson and other authors in Hutchinson‚Äôs Magazine, and continued to design book jackets for publishers including Hodder & Stoughton, Herbert Jenkins, T. Fisher Unwin, Eveleigh Nash, William Collins and Constable. The books for T. Fisher Unwin included dust jackets for new impressions in 1923 of eleven of E. Nesbit's famous children‚Äôs novels and James Hilton's rare second novel called Storm Passage. Blampied also illustrated a film edition of Black Beauty by Anna Sewell and a new edition of The Roadmender by Michael Fairless. Blampied held his first exhibition of paintings and drawings, rather than prints, at the Leicester Galleries in February 1923 while continuing regularly to exhibit his prints at the annual shows of the Royal Society of Painter Etchers and Engravers and the Senefelder Club of British lithographers, named after Alois Senefelder, the inventor of the method. Blampied was a member of the Council of both societies for periods between 1924 and 1938.  Travel in Tunisia  At the end of 1926 Blampied gave up his work for books and magazines, sold his house and studio in south London, and travelled in southern France and north Africa for about 5 months. Some of his drawings from this period were bought by Martin Hardie for the Victoria and Albert Museum and for Eton College, a private school. For the next three years after his return to London in April 1927, Blampied designed many prints, mostly using drypoint, dabbled in abstract art during an illness to produce what he called his \\"Colour symphonies\\", and produced watercolours and oils for a major exhibition held in May 1929 at the galleries of Alex. Reid and Lefevre.  Blampied as humorist  The artist in 1938 When the market for etchings collapsed during the great depression in the early 1930s, Blampied reinvented himself as a cartoonist and caricaturist at an exhibition in 1931 called \\"Blampied‚Äôs Nonsense Show\\". This brought out his love of the absurd and led to his only book, obscurely entitled Bottled Trout and Polo. In this period Blampied also published more than 30 humorous lithographs, many of dogs, that are not recorded in either of the catalogues raisonn√© (see Bibliography). After illustrating a new edition of Travels with a Donkey in the C√©vennes by Robert Louis Stevenson, Blampied returned to work for magazines in 1933 with a weekly series of illustrations of British life in ink and sepia wash for The Illustrated London News. Blampied‚Äôs few published portraits are known from this time, although he did not particularly enjoy doing them. From photographs he drew small pencil portraits of authors and actors for a magazine called The Queen and an oil of Queen Mary (Mary of Teck) for the Christmas issue in 1934; he collaborated with his great friend and benefactor John St Helier Lander, a noted portrait artist and fellow- Jerseyman, on a picture of King George V; and he did an etching of the Jersey- born politician, Lord Portsea (Bertram Falle), which was shown at the Royal Academy in 1934. After finishing his work for the Illustrated London News in 1935 he continue to work for magazines until 1939, mainly doing occasional cartoons for The Sketch, often featuring two tramps called Horace and George.  Peter and Wendy  In May 1938 Blampied was elected to the Royal Society of British Artists. Later that year he was asked to prepare some new illustrations for a lavish edition of Peter Pan, the rights to which had been bequeathed by J. M. Barrie to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. The Blampied Edition of Peter and Wendy was published in 1939 by Hodder & Stoughton in the UK and by Scribners in the US, and is one of the finest illustrated editions of this book.  German occupation of Jersey  By the time Peter and Wendy was published Blampied had moved from London to Jersey with the intention of settling there. Even though by June 1940 it was clear that the Channel Islands would not be defended from the Germans, Blampied and his Jewish wife had decided to remain on the island. Jersey was occupied on 1 July 1940 and Blampied was trapped there for almost five years by the German Occupation of the island until its liberation on 9 May 1945. During this period he was unable to remain in contact with publishers and art dealers, and had great trouble obtaining artists' materials. But there were two notable commissions. Stamps designed by Blampied issued in 1943 for use in Jersey during the German Occupation The lack of currency in Jersey led to a request to design bank notes for the States of Jersey in denominations of 6 pence, 1 shilling, 2 shillings, 10 shillings and 1 pound, which were issued in April 1942. The 6d note was designed by Blampied in such a way that the word six on the reverse incorporated an outsized \\"X\\" so that when the note was folded, the result was the resistance symbol \\"V\\" for victory. A year later he was asked to design six new postage stamps for the island of ¬Ω d to 3 d, and as a sign of resistance he cleverly incorporated the initials GR in the three penny stamp to display loyalty to King George VI. The only exhibition of his work during the war years was held at the Cleveland Museum of Art from February 1941 which showed 187 works mostly from the collection of Harold J Baily, an American lawyer who had been a notable patron of Blampied since 1927. The etching A Jersey vraic cart, which Blampied had just managed to have printed and signed before the island was invaded, was issued by the Print Club of Cleveland to coincide with the exhibition. Blampied did not return to London after the war but remained in Jersey, mostly working in oils and watercolours, except for a series of 12 silhouettes he published in 1950 and a few etchings in 1958, one of which he exhibited at the Royal Academy. In 1948 he designed a postage stamp to celebrate the third anniversary of the liberation of Jersey, and he designed the first Jersey regional stamp, issued in 1964. He continued to sell his watercolours and oil paintings in the UK and US, mostly at the annual exhibitions of the Royal Society of British Artists and through the dealers Annans in Glasgow and Guy Mayer in New York. A large exhibition of his work was held at the John Nelson Bergstrom Art Center and Museum, Neenah, Wisconsin in July 1954. His last exhibition was held at the Barreau Art Gallery of Jersey Museum in October 1964. Blampied died in Jersey on 26 August 1966, aged 80 years. His ashes were scattered in St Aubin's Bay, Jersey.  Body of work  Blampied was a prolific illustrator and over 600 issues of magazines and newspapers have been recorded containing his work between 1905 and 1939. His illustrations appear in around 50 books, and he designed the dust jacket for some 150 other books, mostly novels. He also designed menu cards, loyal addresses, sheet music, Christmas cards, commercial advertising material and bookplates.Hall, A. (2011). The bookplates of Edmund Blampied. The Bookplate Journal vol. 9, no. 2, 59-61. During his career Edmund Blampied produced some 200 etchings and drypoints, and more than 80 lithographs and lithographic prints, many of which depicted rural life in his beloved island of Jersey. His scenes of collecting seaweed, called vraic, from the beaches of the island using a horse and cart were, he said, his signature tune. Besides his work in the visual arts, he also amused himself and his friends by writing poetry in J√®rriais,Blampied, Edmund (1997). L√© Niol√Æn Biampi. Les Nouvelles Chroniques du Don Balleine Vol. I, Nos 32, 33, 34. Jersey: Le Don Balleine. signing himself as Un Tout-√†-trav√®rs. In 1933, La Chronique de Jersey, a French language newspaper, considered publishing a booklet of Blampied poems illustrated by the artist himself, but the plans came to nothing. In 1938 two of his poems were set pieces at the Jersey Eisteddfod. In 1944 he wrote words for an insulting anti-Hitler song entitled La chanson Hitleur and provided illustrations for two poems written by Winter Le Brocq.

The film stars Sting as Baron Charles Frankenstein and Jennifer Beals as Eva, a woman he creates in the same fashion as his infamous monster. The film, an international co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, was released theatrically on August 16, 1985 by Columbia Pictures to generally negative reviews from critics. It was a commercial failure, grossing only $3.6 million. Plot Charles, Baron Frankenstein (Sting), Dr. Zalhus (Quentin Crisp), and Frankenstein's assistant, Paulus (Timothy Spall), attempt to create a female mate, Eva (Jennifer Beals), for his creation (Clancy Brown). They succeed, but after being taught by Dr. Frankenstein, she has her own ideas about what is good for her.

Rinaldo, who also wrote the scripts for several Universal films, including Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951); Hold That Ghost (1941); The Black Cat (1941) and The Invisible Woman (1940). Some scenes were shot amidst the statuary at the Gardens of Bomarzo in Lazio, Italy. Reception Colin Greenland reviewed The Bride for White Dwarf #73, and stated that \\"Derek Hayes and Phil Austin animate a powerful story with close affinities to the best strips in magazines like Warrior or Escape.

He reigned for 38 years from 1460 to 1497; his era was eulogized as the Prospered reign of H·ªìng ƒê·ª©c (Ê¥™Âæ∑‰πãÁõõÊ≤ª). Biography L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng's birth name is L√™ H·∫°o (ÈªéÁÅù), courtesy name T∆∞ Th√†nh (ÊÄùË™†), pseudonym ƒê·∫°o Am ch·ªß nh√¢n (ÈÅìÂ∫µ‰∏ª‰∫∫), rhymed name Tao ƒê√†n nguy√™n s√∫y (È®∑Â£áÂÖÉÂ∏•), formal title Thi√™n Nam ƒë·ªông ch·ªß (Â§©ÂçóÊ¥û‰∏ª), was the son of emperor L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng and his consort Ng√¥ Th·ªã Ng·ªçc Dao. He was a half-brother of L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng and it is likely that his mother and consort Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh (the mother of L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng) were related (cousins or perhaps sisters). He was educated just like his half brother, the emperor, at the palace in Hanoi. When his elder half brother, Nghi D√¢n, staged a coup and killed the emperor in 1459, Prince T∆∞ Th√†nh was spared. Nine months later, when the second counter-coup was successfully carried out, the plotters asked Prince T∆∞ Th√†nh to become the new emperor and he accepted. The leaders of the counter-coup which removed and killed Nghi D√¢n were two of the last surviving friends and aides of L√™ L·ª£i- Nguy·ªÖn X√≠ and ƒêinh Li·ªát. The pair had been out of power since the 1440s, but they still commanded respect due to their association with the dynasty's founder, L√™ L·ª£i. The new emperor appointed these men to the highest positions in his new government: Nguy·ªÖn X√≠ became one of the emperor's councilors, and ƒêinh Li·ªát was gifted command over the army of Vi·ªát Nam. =The idea of rule= L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng created and widely distributed a new legal code- also called 'H·ªìng ƒê·ª©c'. The new laws were > \\"based on Chinese law but included distinctly Vietnamese features, such as > recognition of the higher position of women in Vietnamese society than in > Chinese society. Under the new code, parental consent was not required for > marriage, and daughters were granted equal inheritance rights with sons. > U.S. Library of Congress Country Studies ‚Äì Vietnam A group of 28 poets was formally recognized by the court (the Tao Dan) and a new official history of Vietnam was written called ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞ (The Full History of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, Â§ßË∂äÂè≤Ë®òÂÖ®Êõ∏). The historian Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n compiled this in 1479Keith Weller Taylor: The Birth of Vietnam. Revision of thesis (Ph.D.). Appendix O, page 355. University of California Press (1991). and it was published under supervision of the emperor. As a young prince he was given the best Confucian education; his teacher was Tran Phong who later wrote about how serious a student Th√°nh T√¥ng had been. He went about implementing Confucian principals in his government and seeing that the land was in Confucian harmony through the invocation of various rituals. The emperor toured the entire country in 1467, addressing local problems that he found, firing government officials that he found to be corrupt, and re-distributing land that had been illegally taken. This made him very popular with the people and increased his base of support among them. He also wrote poetry, some of which has survived. He wrote the following at the start of his campaign against the Champa: > One hundred thousand officers and men, > Start out on a distant journey. > Falling on the sails, the rain > Softens the sounds of the army. L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng tried to be and essentially succeeded in becoming the ideal Confucian ruler; he was deeply concerned with maintaining a good government and keeping personal morality. =The rise of Confucianism= First page of an essay to encourage people study Confucian literature, written by emperor Th√°nh T√¥ng Th√°nh T√¥ng was strongly influenced by his Confucian teachers and he resolved to make Vi·ªát Nam more like the former Song Dynasty with its Neo- Confucianist philosophy and the key idea that the government should be run by men of noble character as opposed to men from noble families. This meant that he needed to take power away from the ruling families (mostly from Thanh H√≥a province) and give power to the scholars who did well on the official examinations. The first step on this path was to revive the examination process, which had continued sporadically in the 1450s. The first examination was held in 1463 and, as expected, the top scholars were men from elsewhere- usually from the river delta surrounding the capital, not from Thanh H√≥a. Th√°nh T√¥ng encouraged the spread of Confucian values throughout Vietnam by having \\"temples of literature\\" built in all the provinces. There, Confucius was venerated and classic works on Confucianism could be found. He also halted the building of any new Buddhist or Taoist temples and ordered that monks were not to be allowed to purchase any new land. Following the Chinese model, L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng divided the government into six ministries; they were Finance, Rites, Justice, Personnel, Army, and Public Works. Nine grades of rank were set up for both the civil administration and the military. A Board of Censors was set up with royal authority to monitor governmental officials and reported exclusively to the emperor. However, governmental authority did not extend all the way to the village level. The villages were ruled by their own councils in Vietnam (Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation D. R. SarDesai, ppg 35‚Äì37, 1988). With the death of Nguy·ªÖn X√≠ in 1465, the noble families from Thanh H√≥a province lost their leader. Soon they were mostly relegated to secondary positions in the new Confucian government of Th√°nh T√¥ng. However, they still retained control over Vietnam's armies as the old general, ƒêinh Li·ªát, was still in command of the army. In 1469, all of Vietnam was mapped and a full census was taken, listing all the villages in the kingdom. Around this time the country was divided into 13 dao (provinces). Each was administrated by a Governor, Judge, and the local army commander. The emperor Th√°nh T√¥ng also ordered that a new census should be taken every six years. Other public works that were undertaken included building and repair of granaries, using the army to rebuild and repair irrigation systems after floods, and sending out doctors to areas afflicted by outbreaks of disease. Also in 1469, Th√°nh T√¥ng's reign name was chosen- Great Virtue (H·ªìng ƒê·ª©c). Even though the emperor, at 25, was relatively young, he had already restored Vietnam's stability, which was a marked contrast from the turbulent times marking the reigns of the two emperors before him. The new government proved to be effective and represented a successful adaptation of the Chinese Confucian system of government outside of China. =Relations with the Ming dynasty= Ewer in shape of a dragon made in Chu ƒê·∫≠u, Vietnam during the years of H·ªìng ƒê·ª©c (1469-1497), Cleveland Museum of Art Coins issued by Emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng during his later reign from 1469 to 1497 L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China and Malacca and cracked down on foreign trade and contacts, enforcing an isolationist policy. Several Malay envoys from the Malacca sultanate were attacked and captured in 1469 by Vi·ªát Nam as they were returning to Malacca from China. The Vietnamese enslaved and castrated the young from among the captured.Tsai (1996), p. 15 Rost (1887), p. 252 Rost (1887), p. 252 A 1472 entry in the Ming Shilu reported that some Chinese from Nanhai escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military. The escapees also reported that up to 100 Chinese men remained captives in Vietnam after they were caught and castrated by the Vietnamese after their ships were blown off course into Vietnam. The Chinese Ministry of Revenue responded by ordering Chinese civilians and soldiers to stop going abroad to foreign countries.„ÄäÊòéÂÆ™ÂÆóÂÆûÂΩï„ÄãÂç∑‰∏ÄÁôæÂÖ≠ÔºåÊàêÂåñÂÖ´Âπ¥‰∏ÉÊúàÁô∏‰∫• China's relations with Vietnam during this period were marked by the punishment of prisoners by castration.Tsai (1996), p. 16 Tsai (1996), p. 245 A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that thirteen Chinese men from Wenchang including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from Hainan to Guangdong's Qin subprefecture (Qinzhou), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the Chenghua Emperor's rule (1464‚Äì1487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, Wu Rui (Âê≥Áëû) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch at the Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to Longzhou. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the Pingxiang magistrate and then was sent to Beijing to work as a eunuch in the palace.Cooke (2011), p. 109 „ÄäÊòéÂ≠ùÂÆóÂÆûÂΩï„ÄãÂç∑‰∏Ä‰∫î‰∏âÔºåÂºòÊ≤ªÂçÅ‰∫åÂπ¥ÂÖ´ÊúàËæõÂçØ The ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞ records that in 1467 in An Bang province of Dai Viet (now Qu·∫£ng Ninh Province) a Chinese ship blew off course onto the shore.

In 1465, Vietnam was attacked by pirates from the north. This was dealt with by sending additional forces to the north to fight the pirates. Th√°nh T√¥ng also sent a military force to the west to subdue the Ai-lao mountain tribe that was raiding the northern border. In 1470, the Vietnamese began preparing for a crucial war against Champa to the south. The war was ignited by Tra-Toan, who led a Cham army into the southern extremities of Vietnam. L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng responded with a swift counterattack; Vietnamese armies were mobilized from all over the country, and in keeping with tradition, an envoy was sent to Beijing explaining the motives of the offensive. On 6 November 1470, he ordered generals ƒêinh Li·ªát and L√™ Niem to lead a vanguard of 100,000 men south into Champa. On 16 November 1470, L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng personally led the main army of 150,000 and marched south. On December 18, the first Vietnamese soldiers entered Champa territory.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., On February 5, Champa king Tra-Toan ordered his brother to lead six generals and 5,000 men and elephants to secretly approach L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng's army. The Vietnamese forces discovered this plan so a force of 30,000 commanded by generals Le Hy Cat, Hoang Nhan Thiem, Le The, and Tr·ªãnh Van Sai attacked the enemy's rear from the sea. At the same time, an army commanded by Nguyen Duc Trung ambushed the Champa army and forced it to withdraw. This army was then completely wiped out by Le Hy Cat's troops. On 27 February, L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng personally led the troops to capture Thi Nai, the most important harbor of Champa. On 29 February, the Vietnamese army surrounded the Champa capital city of Vijaya (near modern-day Qui Nh∆°n). The city was captured, and the Cham king, Tra-Toan, was taken captive. He died on the return journey to Thang Long. Cham losses were immense, with some 60,000 dead and 30,000 enslaved. The Champa regions of Amaravati and Vijaya were formally annexed to the Vietnamese kingdom as the newly organized province of Quang-nam. The Vietnamese army continued marching south until it reached C·∫£ pass ‚Äì some 50 miles north of the Champa city of Kauthara (modern-day Nha Trang). The conquest of the Cham kingdoms started a rapid period of expansion by the Vietnamese southwards into this newly conquered land. The government used a system of land settlement called ƒë·ªìn ƒëi·ªÅn (Â±ØÁî∞). > Under this system, military colonies were established in which soldiers and > landless peasants cleared new areas, began rice production on the new lands, > established villages and served as a militia to defend them.

U.S. Library of Congress Country > Studies ‚Äì Vietnam In 1479, in response to continued attacks from the west, L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng waged war against the Kingdom of LƒÅn XƒÅng (modern day Laos). A powerful Vietnamese army invaded the Lao lands, sacking the capital city of Luang PhrabƒÅng (Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation D. R. SarDesai, pg 35, 1988), despite an eventual Lao counteroffensive which repulsed the Vietnamese. Dai Viet would intervene at least once more in Laos during the rule of Tr·ªãnh CƒÉn in 1694. As a result of this war, the modern-day provinces of Lai Ch√¢u and ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n were annexed by ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát from Lan Xang, and are still part of Vietnam today.

Like his siblings, he had little contact with his mother after his parents separated in 1811, preferring to rely on his expectations from his father.Ziegler, Philip, William IV, William Collins, 1971, p. 108. He served as an army officer during the Peninsular War and subsequently in India. His father, though proud of his military record, was deeply concerned about his drinking and gambling, vices to which many of William's brothers were prone. He was created Earl of Munster, Viscount FitzClarence and Baron Tewkesbury on 4 June 1831, and made a Privy Councillor in 1833. \\"Earl of Munster\\" had been a title held by his father before his accession to the British throne. George, like his siblings, was dissatisfied with the provisions made for him and this, combined with his increasing mental instability, caused a series of quarrels with his father which ended in a complete breach.Ziegler, p. 158. The estrangement caused the King great distress, but those close to him thought it better that there be as little contact as possible, since Munster's visits invariably upset his father. Even the death of Munster's sister Sophia de L'Isle, the King's favourite child, in April 1837, did not bring about a reconciliation. He gained the rank of major- general in the British Army and held the office of aide-de-Camp to his father King William IV between 1830 and 1837. He held the office of Lieutenant of the Tower of London between 1831 and 1833, was Constable and Governor of Windsor Castle between 1833 and 1842 and aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria between 1837 and 1841.

It causes sarcoma in chickens. As with all retroviruses, it reverse transcribes its RNA genome into cDNA before integration into the host DNA. History RSV was discovered in 1911 by Peyton Rous, working at Rockefeller University in New York City, by injecting cell free extract of chicken tumour into healthy Plymouth Rock chickens. The extract was found to induce oncogenesis. The tumour was found to be composed of connective tissue (a sarcoma). Thus, RSV became known as the first oncogenic retrovirus that could be used to study the development of cancer molecularly. In 1958, Harry Rubin and Howard Temin developed an assay where chicken embryo fibroblasts could be altered morphologically by RSV infection. Two years later Temin concluded that the transformed morphology of the cells was controlled by a genetic property of RSV. At that time it was unknown, but later the src gene was identified as responsible for morphological transformation in healthy cells. During the 1960s, two findings emerged: replication-competent isolated viruses were related to RSV, but were non-transforming, and an isolated replication-defective strain of RSV was transformation-competent. These two findings gave rise to the notion that viral replication and malignant transformation are separate processes in RSV. Rous was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the significance of his discovery in 1966.Nobelprize.org The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1966: Peyton Rous, retrieved 1 Jul 2012 Subsequently, after other oncogenic human viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, were discovered. Furthermore, oncogenes were found initially in retroviruses and then in cells. Structure and genome RSV is a class VI enveloped virus with a positive sense RNA genome having a DNA intermediate. RSV has four genes: *gag ‚Äì encodes capsid proteins *pol ‚Äì encodes reverse transcriptase *env ‚Äì encodes the envelope gene *src ‚Äì encodes a tyrosine kinase that attaches phosphate groups to the amino acid tyrosine in host cell proteins. The RSV genome has terminal repeats enabling its integration into the host genome and also overexpression of RSV genes. =Src gene= The src gene is oncogenic as it triggers uncontrolled growth in abnormal host cells. It was the first retroviral oncogene to be discovered. It is an acquired gene, found to be present throughout the animal kingdom with high levels of conservation between species. The src gene was taken up by RSV and incorporated into its genome conferring it with the advantage of being able to stimulate uncontrolled mitosis of host cells, providing abundant cells for fresh infection. The src gene is not essential for RSV proliferation but it greatly increases virulence when present. Src is a tyrosine kinase involved in regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It has an SH2 and SH3 domain, which are responsible for its activation and deactivation. =RNA secondary structure= The RNA genome of RSV contains an extremely long 3' UTR that ranges between 5‚Äì7 kb in length which would usually direct it toward nonsense mediated decay (NMD) within the eukaryotic host cell. A conserved secondary structure element has been identified within the 3'UTR and is known as the Rous Sarcoma Virus Stability Element (RSE). This element has been shown to prevent the degradation of the unspliced viral RNA. The RSE element was first identified in the genome of the Rous Sarcoma Virus but appears to be widely conserved across the avian retrovirus family. The RSE element is ~300 bp in length and located downstream of the gag natural translational termination codon. The secondary structure of the RSE element has been determined by RNAse digestion and SHAPE chemistry analysis. Other elements that have been identified in RSV include a primer binding site. =Gag protein= Gag proteins are necessary for virion assembly and mature virus infection of the host cell. The gag protein (Pr76) for RSV contains 701 amino acids. It is cleaved by virus encoded protease, releasing products found in the infectious virion. These cleaved products include the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC), which are able to enter other pathways to infect new cells. =RSV envelope= RSV has an envelope which has one glycoprotein: env. Env is made up of gp85 and gp37, which are glycoproteins that assemble into oligomers. The function of env is to bind RSV to the host cell receptor and induce fusion with the target cell in a pH independent manner. The envelope is acquired during exocytosis. The virus buds or pushes on the plasma membrane, which allows it to leave the cell with a new outer membrane from the host cell. Replication cycle =Cell entry= There are two ways viruses can enter the host cell: cell receptor endocytosis or fusion. Endocytosis is the process where the virus binds a receptor on the target cell membrane, and the virus is taken into or endocytosed into the cell. Endocytosis can either be pH independent or pH dependent. Fusion occurs when the virus fuses together with the target cell membrane and releases its genome into the cell. RSV enters the host cell through fusion of the host cell membrane. =Transcription= In order for the RSV genome transcription to occur, a primer is required. 4S RNA is the primer for RSV and 70S RNA serves as the template for DNA synthesis. Reverse transcriptase, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, transcribes viral RNA into the full length DNA complement.

Early life and career Born Anthony Edward Lewis in Birmingham, he lost his parents when young: his mother Ida (n√©e Poulton) died when he was five from septicaemia following a back-street abortion, and his father Tom Lewis, a garage mechanic turned insurance salesman, committed suicide nineteen days later.The Birmingham Mail, 6 January 1942, p.3 column E Tony was raised by his maternal aunt and uncle, Emily and Harold Garnett, whose surname he adopted in his late teens (while also simplifying his forenames), and his younger brother Peter was raised by other relatives.Jason Deans and Maggie Brown \\"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\\", The Guardian, 28 April 2013 Garnett attended the Central Grammar School in Birmingham and read Psychology at University College, London.Maggie Brown \\"Television producer Tony Garnett: 'I'm only interested in love and politics'\\", The Guardian, 28 April 2013 By his own admission, he spent most of his time acting in the Drama Society and on television.\\"Biography\\", Tony Garnett's website Beginning as an actor, Garnett appeared in An Age of Kings (1960), the BBC's mounting of Shakespeare's eight contiguous history plays, the courtroom film The Boys (1962), several television plays by David Mercer, and an episode Catherine (1964) in the Teletale series, significant for his career because it led to his first meeting with its director, Ken Loach.Lez Cooke \\"Garnett, Tony (1936‚Äì)\\", BFI screenonline Work with Ken Loach and others Recruited by Roger Smith, he became an assistant story editor at the BBC, working on The Wednesday Play.In the interview with Maggie Brown Garnett asserts he was \\"taken on\\" by producer James MacTaggart. The plays he worked on included the \\"very, very personal\\" Up the Junction (1965), directed by Loach, which features a then still illegal abortion, but he was soon under contract as a producer. The best known of his contributions to The Wednesday Play series in this role is the docudrama Cathy Come Home (1966), again directed by Loach. Garnett in 1967 introduced Loach to writer Jim Allen, who would be one of the director's collaborators for a quarter of a century. Garnett worked with Allen too, sometimes independently of Loach (The Lump, 1967), but also with him on such works as Allen's The Big Flame (1969), which had been shot in February and March 1968, but was withheld from transmission by the BBC. Together with dramatist David Mercer, fellow producers Kenith Trodd and James MacTaggart, and literary agent Clive Goodwin, Garnett founded Kestrel Productions, which was conceived as an autonomous unit connected with London Weekend Television. The arrangement led to the production of seventeen television dramas within two years. He and his colleagues, though, found the experience as limiting as they had their period at the BBC. LWT required Garnett and his colleagues to mainly use their television studio and record on video tape, only allowing them to shoot on film and on location occasionally. Despite this, as Kestrel Films, the production company had an interest in the feature films Kes (1969), based on a Barry Hines novel, and Family Life (1971), from a television play by David Mercer. Both were produced by Garnett and directed by Loach. In 1969, Garnett was the producer of Loach's The Save the Children Fund Film. Commissioned by the charity itself, and originally intended for screening by LWT, it was suppressed for forty years after Save the Children disowned it, and only finally screened in 2011 at BFI Southbank. Days of Hope (1975) was a four-part serial for the BBC written by Jim Allen and directed by Loach. It recounts events from the Great War to the General Strike of 1926. A two-part Play for Today, The Price of Coal (1977), reunited Garnett and Loach with Barry Hines, and was their response to the silver jubilee of the Queen, mixing that celebration with a fatal accident involving two miners. The Spongers (1978), written by Allen and directed by Roland Joff√©, also used the background of the silver jubilee, this time in the context of government spending cuts in the welfare state, in particular the closure of facilities used by a child with learning difficulties. Garnett produced G.F. Newman's Law and Order (1978), a quartet of dramas looking at the failings of the British criminal justice system. Its broadcast resulted in questions being asked in parliament. The last production from Garnett's association with Loach was the children's film, Black Jack (1979). Later career Garnett's later film credits include Prostitute (1980), Handgun (1983), Earth Girls Are Easy (1988) and Beautiful Thing (1996). After relocating to the United States, Garnett lived by the principle \\"a movie should never be about what it's about\\" meaning that, although Earth Girls is disguised as a space comedy about aliens and Follow That Bird (1985) is a Sesame Street style children's film, the real theme of these motion pictures is racial prejudice.Brian Winston \\"Garnett, Tony ‚Äì British producer\\", Museum of Broadcast Communications In 1990, he founded World Productions, for which Garnett oversaw Between the Lines (1992‚Äì94) and This Life (1996‚Äì97) and other productions.

Retrieved 23 June 2012. During its course, the overwhelming majority of Yemenite Jews ‚Äì some 47,000 from Yemen, 1,500 from Aden, as well as 500 from Djibouti and Eritrea and some 2,000 Jews from Saudi Arabia‚Äì were airlifted to Israel. British and American transport planes made some 380 flights from Aden. At some point, the operation was also called Operation Messiah's Coming.  The operation  The operation's official name originated from two biblical passages: * Book of Exodus 19:4 - Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. * Book of Isaiah 40:31 - But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. The Operation Magic Carpet was the first in a series of operations. Israel sees the rescue operation as a successful rescue of Yemen's community from oppression toward redemption. 49,000 Jews were brought to Israel under the program.Tom Segev, 1949: The First Israelis. 1998, pp. 182-185. A street in Jerusalem, one in Herzliya, one in Ramat Gan, and another in Kerem HaTeimanim, Tel Aviv, were named \\"Kanfei Nesharim\\" (\\"Wings of Eagles\\") in honor of this operation. In 1948, there were 55,000 Jews living in Yemen , and another 8,000 in the British Colony of Aden. Anti-Jewish violence Following the 1947 UN Partition Plan, Muslim rioters attacked the Jewish community in Aden and killed at least 82 Jews (1947 Aden riots) and destroyed a number of Jewish homes.Ahroni, R. The Jews of the British Crown Colony of Aden: History, Culture, and Ethnic Relations. Brill, 1994: P210-11. Early in 1948, accusations of the murder of two Muslim Yemeni girls led to looting of Jewish property.Reuben Ahroni, Jewish Emigration from the Yemen, 1951-98: Carpet Without Magic, pp.xi-xii, p. 1.  Reasons for the exodus  Jewish Agency's emissary, Rabbi Yaakov Shraibom was sent in 1949 to Yemen and discovered that there were around 50,000 Jews living in Yemen, which was unknown at the time to the Jewish state. He sent multiple letters to convey the community's strong religious and messianic desire to come to Israel. David Ben-Gurion was reluctant at first, but he came through eventually. Esther Meir-GlitzensteinEsther Meir-Glitzenstein, The Exodus of the Yemenite Jews ‚àí A Failed Operation and a Formative Myth, Resling, Tel Aviv 2012. showed evidence how the community's sentiment for Aliyah played a part in the exodus, the extent of which surprised even the Jewish state and the agency in charge of the operation, who were not prepared for the mass of Jews who were fleeing Yemen. Once he realized that, Shraibom tried to prevent the coming crisis and urged the community to stay in Yemen, but the sentiment of the community for Aliyah was stronger and they came nonetheless. Meir-Glitzenstein also claims that collusion between Israel and the Imam of Yemen who \\"profited hugely from confiscatory taxes levied on the Jewish community\\" led to a botched operation in which the Jewish community suffered terribly.'Operation Magic Carpet: Constructing the Myth of the Magical Immigration of Yemenite Jews to Israel,' in Israel Studies, vol.16, No.3 (Fall) 2011 pp. 149-173.

Brill, 1996). argue that economic motivations also had a role in the massive emigration of Yemeni Jews, which began prior to 1948. Tudor Parfitt described the reasons for the exodus as multi-faceted, some aspects due to Zionism and others more historically based:  Critiques  Esther Meir-Glitzenstein also criticized the execution of the operation. She especially criticized the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and Israel, which, according to her, abandoned thousands of Jews in the deserts on the border between North Yemen and Aden. Mismanagement or corruption by the imam of Yemen, the British authorities, and the Jewish Agency also played a role. Some 850 Yemenite Jews died en route to their departure points, and in the community which reached Israel, infant mortality rates were high, but still lower than in Yemen.Vered Lee 'The frayed truth of Operation Magic Carpet', at Haaretz, 28 May 2012Tudor Parfitt, The Road to Redemption: The Jews of the Yemen, 1900-1950, BRILL, 1996, p. 239ff. According to Ben-Gurion's diary, the Yemeni children in the Israeli ma'abarot or tent transit camps were dying like flies. Children were often separated from their parents for hygienic reasons, or taken away to hospitals for treatment, but often, parents only received notification, often by loudspeaker, they had died. According to some testimony, there was a suspicion that the state kidnapped healthy Yemeni children, for adoption, and then informed the parents they had died. As a result, some decades later, the Yemenite Children Affair exploded, in which it was rumoured that something of the order of 1,000 children had gone missing.Meira Weiss, 'The Immigrating Body and the Body Politic: The 'Yemenite Children Affair' and Body Commodification in Israel', in Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Lo√Øc Wacquant (eds.), Commodifying Bodies, Sage Publications, 2002 pp. 93-110, pp. 93ff. However, in 2019, Yaacov Lozowick, the former Israel State Archivist, explained the cases of the missing Yemenite babies in an article in Tablet magazine. There was a very high death rate, and disturbed medical professionals, he said, autopsied some of the bodies to try to find out why. Traditionally, autopsies were forbidden under Jewish law, and so this was hidden from the parents. Lozowick wrote that the files contained no evidence of any kidnappings.Yaacov Lozowick, \\"The Myth of the Kidnapped Yemenite Children, and the Sin it Conceals,\\" Tablet Magazine, March 14, 2019 https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/278261/myth-of-kidnapped- yemenite-children  The Jewish community in Yemen after the operation  In 1959, another 3,000 Jews from Aden fled to Israel, while many more left as refugees to the United States and the United Kingdom. The emigration of Yemeni Jews continued as a trickle, but stopped in 1962, when a civil war broke out in North Yemen, which put an abrupt halt to further emigration. In 2013, a total of some 250 Jews still lived in Yemen.The Jews of Yemen by Mitchell Bard], Jewish Virtual LibraryFact Sheet: Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries, Jewish Virtual Library, September 2012 The Jewish communities in Raydah were shocked by the killing of Moshe Ya'ish al-Nahari in 2008. His wife and nine children emigrated to Israel. Other members of the Jewish community received hate letters and threats by phone. Amnesty International wrote to the Yemeni government, urging the country to protect its Jewish citizens. The human rights organization stated that it is \\"deeply concerned for the safety of members of the Jewish community in northwestern Yemen following the killing of one member of the community and anonymous serious threats to others to leave Yemen or face death\\".Amnesty Int‚Äôl urges Yemen to protect its Jew , JTA, 24-12-2008. During the Gaza War, the Jewish communities in Raydah were attacked several times.Martin Gehlen, Minderheiten: Verloren zwischen den Fronten in: Der Tagesspiegel, 14 July 2009 It was forbidden for native-born Yemeni Jews who had left the country to re-enter, rendering communication with these communities difficult. Muslims were therefore hired as shelihim (emissaries) to locate the remaining Jews, pay their debts, and transport them to Aden.

The population in 2011 was 3,780,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 244.14 km2. History There have been historians that affirm that the Narbasi, a proto- Roman Iberian clan mentioned by Ptolemy, first gathered in this region. =Medieval= There are various versions and legends associated with the municipality's toponymy. Of all the examples, there are common deductions: a Espada na Cinta de um Freixo (which literally means sword on the belt of an ash). There is no doubt that freixo in this context refers to the ash tree, a Portuguese derivative of the Latin fraxinus, although the rest of the toponymic name is still confounded in legend. One legend recalls that the settlement of Freixo was established by a nobleman names Feij√£o, who died in 977, cousin of S√£o Rosendo, whose heraldry included both an ash tree and belted-sword, to which the community received its name. Another legend suggests that the name was derived from a nobleman named Espadacinta; after a battle with Arabs along the margins of the Douro River, he arrived in this territory, and tired, he rested in the shadow of a large ash tree, where he hung his sword. This perpetuated the name for the settlement, which soon became known as Freixo de Espadacinta. A similar story recounts that it was King Denis who, fatigued from his battles with his illegitimate son (Afonso Sanches), and travelling through the wilderness of Freixo, he rested under the shadow of the ash tree, where he impaled his broadsword. The King fell asleep, and after a dream, declared that the village would be known as Freixo de Espada √† Cinta. Today, near the Matriz Church, which once pertained to the medieval castle, exists an old ash tree, which is accepted by the local residents as the fabled tree impaled by the King. It was in this region that Afonso II sustained attacks by Alfonso IX of Le√≥n who protected his sisters. The land was taken and sacked in 1211 by Leonese forces. Much later, in 1236, during the reign of Sancho II Freixe was encircled by the Castilian Infante Afonso, the son of Ferdinand, but the citizens were able to defend the Castilian embargo and drive their forces into retreat. In recompense, the Portuguese monarch conceded the category of vila (town) in 1240. Shortly after, on 27 March 1248, King Afonso conferred a foral (charter) on this region, and renewing the diploma on 20 January 1273. The medieval privileges of the foral also permitted the town to be represented in the Cortes. The municipality of Freixo, hoping that a medieval fair could help the merchant community and increase the number of local residents (to defend the territory), made a petition to King Denis in 3017, which the monarch conferred on the city on 9 March 1307 (to be held monthly for a day). Continuing their rise, the burgh petitioned King Afonso IV to conclude the walling of the town, which also allowed the construction of the Matriz Church completed during the regin of King John IV. Afonso V maintained many of the infrastructures within the village of Freixo de Espada √† Cinta, but donated all the other royal rights to Vasco Fernandes Sampaio, the regions first donatorio, which remained within the hereditary titles of the family for the many centuries (until the 19 July 1790 law that abolished the donatorio system). King Manuel authorized a new foral for Freixo on 1 October 1512. The village would continue to suffer for many years during the Frontier Wars, namely between 1580 and 1640, as pillaging and destruction of settlements along the border continued between Castile and Portugal. The sacking of Lagoa√ßa and Fornos in 1644 were examples of these events. On 10 September 1673, brothers of the Order of the Oratory arrived in Freixo, and began to build the Convent of S√£o Filipe Nery, which was the second to be built in Portugal to the invocation of Saint Philip Neri. =Monarchy= Owing to a decline in local agriculture the Ju√≠z de Fora instituted awards to motive the local economy (1786), promoting the three pillars of the economy: olive and cherry orchards and silk production. This would become important as, by 1792, the Douro becomes a navigable waterway, and products could be easily transported by the waterway. During the Liberal turmoils of the 19th century, the settlements in Lagoa√ßa, Fornos and Mazouco are visited daily by rebel forces that escaped into Spain, during the latter- part of King John IV reign. But by 1832, Freixo was squarely on the side of Miguelist forces, who supported Miguel. Between 1854-55, the region is infected by a cholera outbreak that especially affected the ecclesiastical parish of Lagoa√ßa. Lagoa√ßa would become a civil parish in 1867, that included the religious parishes of Fornos, Carvi√ßais, Estevais (de Mogadouro), Castelo Branco, Vilarinho dos Galegos and Bru√ß√≥. In the same year, the District Junta Geral of Bragan√ßa established a contract with local farmer Manuel Guerra Tenreiro to provide 180,000 feet of mulberry trees to be distributed to many of the municipalities of the District. During the Janeirinha (1868) the municipal council hall, which then dated back to the medieval epoch was assaulted and burned down. In 1896 the municipality of Freixo de Espada √† Cinta is abolished and its lands appended to the municipality of Torre de Moncorvo. It residents persisted and were able to reposition the region in order to re-establish the municipality on 13 January 1898 (issuance of a municipal foral). =Republic= A local syndicate was established in 1902 (lasting until 1905) to support local agriculture (). On 17 September 1911 the first raillink is inaugurated between Pocinho and Carvi√ßais, but it would be more than 16 years before the communities of Carvi√ßais and Lagoa√ßa would be connected. The Bishop of Bragan√ßa prohibited the typical loas to Santo Ant√≥nio which were a mix of oratory and religious satire. Geography =Physical geography= Freixo de Espada √† Cinta is part of the Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro in the district of Bragan√ßa, located 180 kilometres northeast of the city of Porto, 400 kilometres northeast of Lisbon and 100 kilometres south of the district seat. It is bordered on the north by the municipality of Mogadouro, to the west by Torre de Moncorvo, east by the province of Salamanca in Spain, and south by the municipality of Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo. Ecoregions/Protected area Located a few minutes from the urban centre, the Praia Fluvial de Congida is a recreational space, with re-qualified leisure spaces, including bar, suspended esplanade, pool and playground. The tourist complex is also the centre for annual trips along the Douro River, organized by the Sociedade Transfronteiri√ßa Congida-La Barca and supported by the municipal council of Freixo de Espada √† Cinta and Ayuntamento de Vilvestre. Within this landscape are several houses, which are part of the Douro International (), which includes ten rustic one-room bungalows, with pool. Sport fishing is also popular in this area, which is encountered in the shadow of the Saucelle Dam/Reservoir, and is stocked with minnows, barbel, barb and carp. =Human geography= Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (freguesias): * Freixo de Espada √† Cinta e Mazouco * Lagoa√ßa e Fornos * Ligares * Poiares Economy =Transport= Freixo is crossed by the national E.N.221 (Guarda-Pinhel-Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo-Freixo de Espada √† Cinta-Miranda do Douro) accessway, which is five kilometres from Saucelle, an important link to the province of Salamanca in Spain. Departing in the morning and ending their circuit at the end of the day (night), the municipality of Freixo has inter-community bus connections to many of the major cities in the region, including Porto, Lisbon, Bragan√ßa, Vila Real and Coimbra. The nearest railway station is now at Pocinho, the terminus of the railway to Oporto via the Douro Valley. The community was formerly served by the Sabor line, a narrow gauge railway which closed in 1988.

On that day, SC Bastia faced Olympique de Marseille for a semifinal match in the French Cup. Marseille was unarguably the best team in France at the time, and the board of Bastia wanted to take advantage of it by adding a large-capacity stand, to increase the number of seats by 50%. Local authorities approved the project without restrictions. Before the game, the stand collapsed, killing 18 and leaving over 2,300 injured. Structural problems, such as instability, were noticeable in the hour before the match. The structure collapsed at 20:23, shortly before the scheduled start of the match. Supporters and media were trapped in the wreckage. The match was never played. All medical resources on the island were fully committed to dealing with the injured and many of the victims were eventually evacuated to the mainland; the airport was reported as resembling a field hospital. Investigation An investigation was opened into the disaster. The investigation concluded there had been a number of violations of rules concerning the construction of the temporary terrace, and in the management of ticketing, and that the attitude of sporting and municipal executives had been problematic. The report concluded \\"Le soir du 5 mai, il n'y a pas eu de fatalit√©\\" (\\"The evening of the 5th of May was avoidable\\"). After a trial a number of those found responsible served short sentences. Later developments Since the disaster, Armand-C√©sari slowly improved, leaving only one of the four stands from 1992. This \\"under construction\\" stadium surprised the players from S.L. Benfica in 1997, as they believed this was the training pitch. Some major improvements finally started end of 1996, for a final capacity of 18,000.

It is very similar in construction and playing technique to the Cambodian sralai. Varieties An entirely different instrument, a bamboo free reed pipe called pi chum (‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏∏‡∏°), is used by the Lanna of Northern Thailand. Pi nok The pi nok is smallest among pi nok, klang, and nai. Pi noks have been played since the ancient times. Pi nai The pi nai (41‚Äì42√ó4.5 cm) is commonly seen in Thai literature such as Phra Aphai Mani. Pi cha nai The pi chanai is pi song thon (‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô, pi that consists of two parts). The body part is called lao pi (‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà), the mouthpiece part is called \\"lamphong\\" (‡∏•‡∏≥‡πÇ‡∏û‡∏á). Both parts are made from wood or ivory. It is presumed that the Thais obtained this musical influence from India due to its similarity to the Indian shehnai. Pi have been used in Thai since the Sukhothai period. At present, it is played together with the pi chawa in parades and in concerts. Pi chawa The pi chawa is pi song thon (‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô) (pi that consist of two parts) like the pi chanai, but longer. It is made from wood or ivory. It is presumed Thais took on introducing the pi chawa as same time as the glong khaek. From some evidence, they used pi chawa in Krabuan Phayuhayattra (‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏´‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏≤, military march) in the pre-Ayutthaya period. The pi chawa today is used mostly during funeral rites. Pi chum A pi chum (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏∏‡∏°) is a musical instrument from northern Thailand. It is like an oboe. It is found in the provinces of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lampoon and Lampang. People play a pi chum for their activity. The word \\"chum\\" in Thai means \\"group\\", so when people play a pi chum, they play as a group. = Construction = The body of the pi chum is made from bamboo. The pipe and the reed are made from copper.‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏∏‡∏° Originally accessed: 2015-11-22. A pi chum has seven holes on the body that are used to set the tone of played,There are four types of pi chum that are separated by size, length and voice. The first one is the pi mae (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà) which has a length of 70‚Äì80 cm. It is larger than other pi chums and has a bass voice. The second one is the pi krang (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏á), which is smaller than the pi mae. It has a length of 60‚Äì65 cm. and it has a balance voice. The third one is pi koy (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢), which is smaller than the pi krang but bigger than the pi tad. It has a length of 45‚Äì55 cm. The voice of the pi koy is treble. The last type is the pi tad (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏î) or pi lek (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡πÄ‡∏•‡πá‡∏Å), which is the smallest pi chum. It has a length 35‚Äì40 cm. The voice of pi tad is treble but higher than the pi koy. A group that has all four instruments is called a ‚Äòpi chum si‚Äô (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏™‡∏µ‡πà) and a group that has three instruments is called a ‚Äòpi chum sarm‚Äô (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°). Pi mon The pi mon is pi song thon (‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô, pi that consist of two parts) like pi chawa but greater. Lao pi (‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà, the body of pi) is made from wood. Lamphong (‡∏•‡∏≥‡πÇ‡∏û‡∏á, the mouth of pi) is made from metal.

Amiga software covers many applications, including productivity, digital art, games, commercial, freeware and hobbyist products. The market was active in the late 1980s and early 1990s but then dwindled. Most Amiga products were originally created directly for the Amiga computer (most taking advantage of the platform's unique attributes and capabilities), and were not ported from other platforms. During its lifetime, thousands of applications were produced with over 10,000 utilities (collected into the Aminet repository). However, it was perceived as a games machine from outside its community of experienced and professional users. More than 12,000 games were available. New applications for the three existing Amiga-like operating systems are generally ported from the open source (mainly from Linux) software base. Many Amiga software products or noteworthy programs during the timeline were ported to other platforms or inspired new programs, such as those aimed at 3D rendering or audio creations, e.g. LightWave 3D, Cinema 4D, and Blender (whose development started for the Amiga platform only). The first multimedia word processors for Amiga, such as TextCraft, Scribble!, Rashumon, and Wordworth, were the first on the market to implement full color WYSIWYG (with other platforms then only implementing black-and-white previews) and allowing the embedding of audio files. History and characteristics =From the origins to 1988= 1985 Amiga software started its history with the 1985 Amiga 1000. Commodore International released the programming specifications and development computers to various software houses, prominently Electronic Arts, a software house that then offered Deluxe Paint, Deluxe Music and others. Electronic Arts also developed the Interchange File Format (IFF) file container, to store project files realized by Deluxe Paint and Deluxe Music. IFF became the de facto standard in AmigaOS. The first to be shown were digitizer software ProPaint (in early beta). Both were used by Andy Warhol to produce a black-and-white photo of Debbie Harry at the Launch Gala at Lincoln Center, New York City in July 1985. In 1985 Commodore licensed the software called Transformer from Simile Research and put it on the market in January 1986, bundled with an external A1020 5.25-inch floppy drive. It emulated 8086 Intel-based PC-XT hardware. It could run MS-DOS and MS-DOS software such as Lotus 123 or WordStar. This provided early access to many applications, while waiting for native Amiga software to be developed. In 1985, Deluxe Paint emerged with graphic features that had been available only on dedicated graphic computers. It was dubbed the first Amiga \\"Killer application\\". 1986 Deluxe Paint II on floppy disk. In 1986 (the year of the launch of Amiga 2000) Amiga software products contributed to the Amiga's success as a game and multimedia machine. AmigaBasic from Microsoft, VizaWrite, TextCraft (word processors), Pagesetter (Desktop Publishing), Analyze! (Spreadsheet), Superbase Personal (Database), MovieCraft (animation), Deluxe paint II, Deluxe Music, Instant Music (a composition music program for non musicians) from Electronic Arts, and GraphiCraft again from Commodore were released. GraphiCraft was used by computer artist Jim Sachs to produce Amiga software such as Defender of the Crown and Centurion: Defender of Rome from Cinemaware and the Amiga porting of Saucer Attack. Graphicraft was a predecessor of Aegis Images and AEGIS Animator, one of the first programs worldwide capable of creating animation videos and cartoons complete with audio stereo, featuring a cel animation working paradigm interface and outputting files based on delta-frame difference compression method which then were the lead for creating the ANIM file type standard. Byte-by-Byte Software Inc. released Sculpt-3D. It was the first rendering tool available for the first time to a vast audience of public, and in October of the same year, Impulse released TurboSilver. 1987 In 1987 the Amiga 500 (A500) was released. The Amiga software market moved in favor of entertainment over professional software. ProWrite (word processor), Maxiplan 500 (spreadsheet), and Aegis Sonix, a music program similar to Instant Music, were produced. . In July, Wordperfect created an \\"Amiga/Atari Division\\" and started selling a version of its word processor for the Commodore platform for US$400. It could load and save Wordperfect files created on any platform, such as IBM, Macintosh and Apple II. Wordperfect 4.1 for the Amiga was the first word processor in the world capable of opening an unlimited number of documents (limited by RAM), each in a separate window. In 1987, Andrew Tanenbaum released Minix, a free version of Unix with complete source code. At COMDEX NewTek showed for the first time a prototype of Video Toaster and Impulse released TurboSilver 2.0. 1988 In 1988, Photon Paint was released. It allowed digital painting using HAM graphics mode and the full 4096-color palette of Amiga on a single screen. Maxiplan 500 become Maxiplan 1.x, Electronic Arts showed DeLuxe Photo Lab (photo editing software), Newtek demonstrated DigiView 3.0 hardware and software image digitizing suite, and WordPerfect released the WordPerfect Library for the Amiga. At the summer Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the Pro Draw graphic tablet with mouse emulation software was also announced, as well as Flash-Back and Quarterback hard drive backup software. Superbase Personal became Superbase Professional, Micro Illusions started shipping Music-X audio software for the Amiga, and Lattice released its C++ preprocessor for the Amiga. Cygnus Editor ubiquitous text editor, one of the most versatile text editors and best seller on Amiga since then, was also released this year. It was one of the first Amiga programs featuring an AREXX port. Gold Disk released ComicSetter (comic creation) and MovieSetter (32-color cartoons with stereo sound animation software). In November, at the World of Commodore Show, ReadySoft demonstrated its Amax Macintosh emulator for the Amiga. =1989‚Äì1994= In 1989, Rashumon was first launched. In 1990, AmigaDOS 2.0 was released. The interface of the Workbench GUI was changed to a fake 3D aspect using gray shades. For the first time, Commodore introduced a style guide for developers on AmigaOS; because of this, the majority of Amiga software developed for AmigaDOS 2.0 had a standardized GUI that improved usability. Programs such as Imagine 3D, Lightwave, ImageFX, and Scala continued using non-standard GUIs. AmigaVision was released and bundled free with any model of Amiga 3000. Directory Master, Directory Opus, TurboCalc, Photogenics, ImageFX, PC Task, Photogenics, Caligari, Final Calc, and Cinema 4D all belong to this period. =1994 to today= After 1994, Commodore's demise left Amiga to an uncertain future. Windows-based PCs became the standard in the home and the office. Many software houses either left the Amiga market or ran into financial troubles. In 1996, Aminet was created. Aminet was the first centralized Internet repository of all Amiga public domain software and documents. It was the first Internet experiment of a centralized software repository created and maintained by one community for the community itself. Amiga's browsers like AWeb, IBrowse and Voyager were enhanced. Voyager was the first browser to adopt tabbed browsing. Mailers like YAM are still used. In productivity software, programs like Candy Factory for image processing were still being developed, for vfx and animation programs like Wildfire by Andreas Maschke (ported by author to Java later). other prominent graphic software include fxPAINT by IOSpirit, fxSCAN for OCR and scanning by IOSpirit, and SketchBlock painting program by Andy Broad for AmigaOS 4.x. Last but not least Tornado3D raytracing program by the Italian company Eyelight. =Usability= Amiga software presents a complete graphical interface, following Amiga WYSIWYG \\"desktop paradigm\\" and native AmigaOS interface guidelines; that is to say, the software is mouse-driven and presents also pull-down \\"menus\\" and \\"dialogue windows\\". AmigaOS maintained a text-based shell allowing software to present a text-based GUI, or a \\"command line\\". Cataloging The main software categories are * Productivity software (also called application software); * Support and maintenance utilities for formatting hard disks, recover or backup data, etc.; * Multimedia software (graphic, video, music); * Communication software (including the software for dealing with Internet and any other net); * Programming tools for developing products and applications; * other utilities that enhance the ease of use in any Operating System (for example Application Launching Docks); Accessibility; Games; Emulation software that allows a computer to run software written for another architecture. =Productivity software= Amiga created productivity software which covers graphics, video, design and CAD software; graphic utilities; vector graphics programs and converters; word processors; programmable text editors; database and spreadsheets; science, entertainment and special use programs: entertainment; fractals, virtual reality, artificial intelligence; route planning; personal Organizer, notebook, diary software; personal budgeting, home banking and accounting. =Support and maintenance utilities= Amiga created utilities for hard disk partitioning; diagnostic tools; VGA promoting tools for ancient Amiga software with TV resolution graphic screens; game loaders for storing and auto-loading from hard disks, auto-starting non- standard floppy disks; disk copiers; backup and recovery tools, archive and compression utilities; command line interfaces and text-based shells; graphical GUI interfaces with WIMP paradigm; advanced graphics systems; PostScript; fonts; font design; audio system; native, external, widely common used, and third-party filesystems; MultiView; MIME types; USB stacks; Firewire stacks (IEEE 1394); printer drivers; video digitizers; graphic tablets; scanner drivers; genlocks, chroma-key, signal video inverters; infrared devices and remote controls; WiFi and Bluetooth devices; and special devices. =Music= Music software includes sound design; audio synthesis; music; audio digitizing and sampling; hard disk recording; speech synthesis; audio trackers; MOD music module filetype. =Communications software= Solutions include modem software, Direct Connect, BBS managing, Fidonet, Packet Radio; Prestel, Videotel, Videotex, Minitel; Teletext, Televideo, Viewdata; FAX, answering machine and voice mail; ISDN; networking and Ethernet protocols; World Wide Web (TCP/IP stacks, browsers, E-mail programs, newsreaders, Internet Radio, proxy server support programs, PPP, Telnet, podcasting, RSS feed, Distributed Net, Google Services, Instant Messaging and chat, FTP and FTP server, weather casting news, Webcam supporting, clock synchronization, SMS Short Messages, Web development and HTTP server, Peer2Peer, VCast (online VCR), YouTube, Flash player, monitoring webpages, Remote Desktop, SSL, SSH, et cetera); communication protocols.

Prestel, Videotel, Videotex, and Minitel In some European countries, and especially in France, Minitel data transmitting services were popular before the Internet. Minitel had many consumer-level communication services, including chatting, email, railway and broadcast timetables and travel and hotel booking. Minitel used little terminals rented from telephone companies or computers with modems that accept Minitel transmission protocol speed. Amiga Minitel communication programs were written in France, Germany and Italy (Amiga Videotel). Teletext, Televideo, and Viewdata Teletext is an information retrieval service system based on transmitting data with normal TV broadcast signals without interfering with TV programs. Standalone programs for teletext included Amiga Teletext and the Videotex datatype.

It was one of the first interactive online graphics-and-sound protocols. It was introduced in 1987 as part of the Skyline (Atredes) bulletin board system (BBS), running on the Skyline BBS and Skyterm terminal. Years before the World Wide Web, Skypix allowed rich interactive graphics and sound, as well as mouse control, to be a part of the online experience, which was until then limited to text and ANSI graphics. Skypix allowed users to write and integrate graphical programs, and included the first \\"authoring program\\", Skypaint. Skypix created enthusiastic game and online application writers years before the World Wide Web made such features a common part of the online experience. It was quickly abandoned as more advanced markup languages for BBS became available and due to the emerging of Internet phenomenon that marginalized the BBS system of communication. =Programming= Despite the variety of programming languages and compilers, most development was done using C and C++, 680x0 assembler and various Basic dialects. =Multimedia= Drivers for multimedia devices and special input functions * Multimedia keyboards: MMKeyboardhttp://www.geit.de/deu_mmkeyboard.html * Hand-writing recognition: Meridian is a program that performs handwriting recognition input functions using a stylus like those equipping any tablet PC, emulating the stylus by mouse.http://www.geit.de/deu_meridian.html Meridian * Graphics tablets: FormAldiHyd, GTDriver, and SlateCtrl are shareware/freeware drivers for several serial-port graphics tablets. \\"mousev1b\\" is a driver to use an Apple Newton as a graphics tablet. =Accessibility software= * Jakeboard input software and hardware emulation keyboard and mouse was used by persons with physical limitations and/or problems of movements.

Optical media Alternative filesystems included AsimCDFS, AmiCDROM, CDVDFS, Allegro CDFS and CacheCDFS. BurnIt!, Frying Pan, MakeCD, AmiDVD, DVDRecord, DVDAuthor could burn CDs, DVDs and/or Blu-ray media. MakeCD was the first Amiga program to support Disk At Once (DAO). Frying Pan was the first Amiga program capable to create DVDs. Frying Pan and BurnIt! are capable to handle DVD. BlueHD from German programmer Carsten Siegner is a MorphOS program capable of authoring and burning HD-DVDs in these formats: * Normal Video-DVD (European PAL) * HD-Video-DVD HDTV (mkv-h264/AAC) (that are recognized by some Blu-ray players) * HD-Video-DVD HDTV (MP4-h264/AVC) =Disk images and ISO files management= * ISO-o-Matic software is a CD image converting software and supports b5i, bin, CD-i, img (normal/CloneCD), mdf (Alcohol 120%), nrg (Nero Burning ROM), pdi and uif. * ISOMount mounts CD ISOs, PC floppy disk images and Amiga disk images.

(A complete list of ISO managements and converters is available on Aminet.) =Utilities= AmiDock creates application launching docks on the desktop. It became popular in 1989‚Äì1990, due to the NeXT computer, that used the same 68030 processor as Amiga 3000) and that it also had the Acorn Archimedes RISC OS docking station utility. In Great Britain, Archimedes computers were adopted in schools. Young Amiga users (there were 1,500,000 Amigas sold in the United Kingdom) spotted docks on Archimedes at school and asked for it on Amiga also. Various launch bars or docking utilities were born as third-party hobby utilities (many examples of early docking software for Amiga like the ToolManager are still hosted in the Aminet repository of all Amiga free software, in the \\"Utility\\" directory) and then Amidock was officially integrated in AmigaOS with version 3.9. Directory Opus was a file utility program. When this software was released, Amiga magazines proclaimed that it was the most important software ever released for the Amiga and \\"should be built into the operating system\\". Directory Opus went on to create a \\"replacement OS\\" for Workbench which overlaid itself upon the system. It started as a file manager, and then became a complete desktop replacement and an alternative to the official Workbench. The utility was later ported to Windows and remains widely used. HyperCache was the first commercial disk caching software. Significant in that the base operating system lacked this ability, the addition of caching significantly improved the performance of both floppy and hard discs.REVIEW: HyperCache Professional, Retrieved April 6, 2016 SysSpeed was a shareware benchmarking program for Amigas equipped with Motorola 68k and PowerPC CPUs. Much shareware and free software was written for the Amiga and could be obtained via the Fred Fish disk series or from the Aminet software archive. Because the custom chipset shares RAM (and therefore the memory bus) with the CPU, throughput increases measurably if the display is disabled. Some processor-intensive software, such as 3D renderers, disable the display during calculation to gain speed. Emulation Notable emulators included: =Commercial= Medusa (Atari ST emulator), Fusion (Macintosh Emulator), AMax and AMax II, (Macintosh), GO64 (first Commodore C64 emulator), Transformer and PCTask (it was an Intel 8088 emulator, all software based, capable to emulate Intel PC based platforms ranging from PC XT 4,7 and 7 MHz on Amiga 500, up to 80486 running at 12 MHz on Amiga 4000 and other accelerated Amigas), A64 Package (C64), Amiga BBC Emulator (Acorn BBC emulator) =Freeware= Atari ST Emulator (AtariST), Hatari (Atari ST and STE), Basilisk II (Macintosh) classic, Frodo (C64), PSXE (Sony PlayStation), Hu-Go!

VICE emulator is modular and emulates all 8-bit machines made by Commodore: C64 (a patch of VICE supports C64dtv), C128, PET including CBM II version (but excluding \\"non-standard\\" features of SuperPET 9000), Plus4 and VIC-20. Games Thousands of games were produced. At the time it was common for games to be produced for multiple formats. Since the Amiga hardware was the most advanced, games were usually developed on an Amiga, and the Amiga version would be the \\"gold standard\\" of the bunch. Demos The Amiga was a focal point for the \\"demo scene\\". The Amiga thrived on public domain, freeware and other not-for-profit development. The demo scene spearheaded development in multimedia programming techniques for the Amiga, such that it was de rigueur for the latest visual tricks, soundtrackers and 3D algorithms from the demo scene to end up being used in computer game development. Piracy Because Amiga was one of the first game-oriented computers to feature a built- in floppy disk drive, it simplified software piracy. Many of the arguments pertaining to software copying, intellectual property rights in software, the open-source movement by the early 1990s. It was not unusual for demo groups to be openly involved in software piracy. Anti-piracy measures included the practice of distributing software on disks that contained secret \\"keys\\" on high-numbered tracks that were officially unused. The Amiga disk drive officially supported tracks 0‚Äì79 from a double-density disk, but could actually read tracks 80 through 82. Standard disk-imaging software ignored these tracks, so that a duplicate of a boxed disk would not contain the key and the software would not work. A similar technique involved writing to normally-unused sectors of the disk. Copy software called \\"nibble\\" copiers appeared that could exactly reproduce such disks. Publishers turned to other methods. Hardware dongles were occasionally used for high-end software. AmigaHASP protected Rashumon and was sold by HarmonySoft to Aladdin Systems. Some software manufacturers asked users to type a word from a particular page number and line number of the manual, meaning that successfully copying software included photocopying a large quantity of text. Sometimes the text was designed so that photocopiers would produce illegible copies, meaning that pirates had to manually add the text. Pirates responded with \\"cracking\\" software that altered the code to bypass copy protection completely. Every protection scheme was eventually broken. One near exception was the scheme on Dragon's Lair, which became the \\"holy grail\\" of crackers worldwide, but it was also broken. \\"Decrunching\\" A single frame of a typical decrunching screen The Amiga's floppy disk drive allowed 880 kilobytes on a single disk, comparable to the RAM of most Amigas (512 kilobytes to 1 megabyte). To increase capacity, Amiga used data compression. The disk drive had a slow transfer rate, such that using processor-based decompression could actually reduce loading times versus loading uncompressed data. Early implementations wrote to a video display register, causing it to break into multiple segments of colorful noise, which would become finer as the decrunching continued. This effect was psychedelic and very easy to implement, so it stuck; it was pioneered on the Commodore 64. =TransADF= TransADF is a program that transfers the contents of a floppy disk or a similar block device to a file. This program can compress the disk image using the popular deflate algorithm, as utilized by PKZip and gzip, amongst others.

The Mishnat ha-Middot argues against the common belief that the Bible defines the geometric ratio (pi) as being exactly equal to 3, based on the description in 1 Kings 7:23 (and 2 Chronicles 4:2) of the great bowl situated outside the Temple of Jerusalem as having a diameter of 10 cubits and a circumference of 30 cubits. He maintained that the diameter of the bowl was measured from the outside brim, while the circumference was measured along the inner brim, which with a brim that is one handbreadth wide (as described in the subsequent verses 1 Kings 7:24 and 2 Chronicles 4:3) yields a ratio from the circular rim closer to the actual value of .Petr Beckmann, A History of Pi, St. Martin's (1971). =Quotes= * \\"Due to the sin of baseless hatred, great strife is found in a man's home, and his wife miscarries, and his sons and daughters die at a young age.\\"Shabbat 32b  See also  * History of numerical approximations of œÄ  References  Mishnah rabbis 2nd-century rabbis Ancient mathematicians Mathematics writers Geometers ","title":"Rabbi Nehemiah"},{"id":"4334906","text":"Epirus in antiquity Chyton, according to Ephorus, was a new cityTravels in Northern Greece.

In addition, there are 900 volunteers. Registered Nurses and Respiratory Therapists are represented by the Ontario Nurses Association Local 124. History A private hospital was founded in 1922 and on August 22, the province granted a Charter of Incorporation for the York County Hospital Corporation. York County Hospital became a public hospital in 1924. In 1927 the new hospital building was completed by architects Craig and Madill. In 1946, the Margaret Johnson Davis Wing opened with 55 beds. In 1956, the South Wing opened and a six-storey tower opened in 1964. Capacity was increased to 420 beds with the opening of the East Wing in 1976. On September 12, 1998, the name of the hospital was changed from York County Hospital to the present name. In 1999, a project to further expand the hospital was begun In October 2015, Southlake Regional Health Centre was once again named one of Greater Toronto's Top 100 Employers by a company named Mediacorp Canada Inc., and published by the Toronto Star. The hospital is connected to the Southlake Regional Cancer Centre to its west, and to a Medical Arts building by an arch bridge to its north occupied principally by University of Toronto's Family Medicine Teaching Unit and other health services. The Stronach Regional Cancer Centre is partnered with Princess Margaret Hospital. Teaching and Research Through its relationships with the University of Toronto, York University, McMaster University, as well as Princess Margaret Hospital, Southlake Regional Health Centre has become a research and teaching facility. Currently, the hospital is averaging more than 6,000 medical training days per year, which is approximately triple its numbers in 2008. Through the Health Centre's Research Institute, Southlake is focusing its energy on a growing number of clinical drug and device trials, and on key research activities in biomedical and population health research. Many staff members and physicians contribute their clinical expertise in a number of regional, provincial, national and international research studies.

He is widely admired as \\"the godfather of independent Canadian cinema,\\" particularly among young, independent filmmakers. Biography Jean Pierre Lefebvre studied literature at the University of Montr√©al and taught for two years at the Jesuit-run Loyola College in Montreal (now part of Concordia University). He began writing as a film critic, first for Quartier Latin, then for S√©quences and Objectif. He directed his first film, a short drama, then three independent features. He joined the National Film Board of Canada and made two films, including the 1968 feature Mon amie Pierrette, co-starring Ra√¥ul Duguay and produced by Cl√©ment Perron. Lefebvre was then asked to head the NFB's French-language fiction studio. He began its Premi√®res Oeuvres series, designed to make low-budget shorts and features. Four features and a number of shorts were produced within a year before the initiative was terminated, and Lefebvre left to form his own production company, Cinak, with his wife and editor, Marguerite Duparc. He writes and produces all his own films. Lefebvre was one of the first Canadian filmmakers to receive international acclaim for his work; his film Don't Let It Kill You (Il ne faut pas mourir pour √ßa) (1967) was the first Canadian film to be invited to the Cannes Film Festival. He proved to be successful again at Cannes when he received the International Critics' Prize for Les fleurs sauvages (1982) and his film Le jour S... (1984) was screened in the Un Certain Regard section. Les derni√®res fian√ßailles (1973) won the prestigious Prix de l'Organisation catholique internationale du cin√©ma in 1974. Il ne faut pas mourir pour √ßa (1967), Le Vieux pays o√π Rimbaud est mort (1977), and Aujourd'hui ou jamais (1997) make up his Abel Trilogy; three feature films starring the recurring character of Abel Gagn√© played by . In 1991, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \\"for his innovative and high-quality feature films\\". In 1995 he was awarded the Prix Albert-Tessier.

Lisp \`Append\` originates in the Lisp programming language. The \`append\` procedure takes zero or more (linked) lists as arguments, and returns the concatenation of these lists. (append '(1 2 3) '(a b) '() '(6)) ;Output: (1 2 3 a b 6) Since the \`append\` procedure must completely copy all of its arguments except the last, both its time and space complexity are O(n) for a list of n elements. It may thus be a source of inefficiency if used injudiciously in code. The \`nconc\` procedure (called \`append!\` in Scheme) performs the same function as \`append\`, but destructively: it alters the cdr of each argument (save the last), pointing it to the next list. =Implementation= \`Append\` can easily be defined recursively in terms of \`cons\`. The following is a simple implementation in Scheme, for two arguments only: (define append (lambda (ls1 ls2) (if (null? ls1) ls2 (cons (car ls1) (append (cdr ls1) ls2))))) Append can also be implemented using fold-right: (define append (lambda (a b) (fold- right cons b a))) Other languages Following Lisp, other high-level languages which feature linked lists as primitive data structures have adopted an \`append\`. Haskell uses the \`++\` operator to append lists. OCaml uses the \`@\` operator to append lists. Other languages use the \`+\` or \`++\` symbols for nondestructive string/list/array concatenation. =Prolog= The logic programming language Prolog features a built-in \`append\` predicate, which can be implemented as follows: append([],Ys,Ys). append([XXs],Ys,[XZs]) :- append(Xs,Ys,Zs). This predicate can be used for appending, but also for picking lists apart. Calling ?- append(L,R,[1,2,3]). yields the solutions: L = [], R = [1, 2, 3] ; L = [1], R = [2, 3] ; L = [1, 2], R = [3] ; L = [1, 2, 3], R = [] =Miranda= This right-fold, from Hughes (1989:5-6), has the same semantics (by example) as the Scheme implementation above, for two arguments. append a b = reduce cons b a Where reduce is Miranda's name for fold, and cons constructs a list from two values or lists. For example, append [1,2] [3,4] = reduce cons [3,4] [1,2] = (reduce cons [3,4]) (cons 1 (cons 2 nil)) = cons 1 (cons 2 [3,4])) (replacing cons by cons and nil by [3,4]) = [1,2,3,4] =Haskell= This right-fold has the same effect as the Scheme implementation above: append :: [a] -> [a] -> [a] append xs ys = foldr (:) ys xs This is essentially a reimplementation of Haskell's \`++\` operator. =Perl= In Perl, the push function is equivalent to the append method, and can be used in the following way. my @list; push @list, 1; push @list, 2, 3; The end result is a list containing [1, 2, 3] The unshift function appends to the front of a list, rather than the end my @list; unshift @list, 1; unshift @list, 2, 3; The end result is a list containing [2, 3, 1] When opening a file, use the \\">>\\" mode to append rather than over write. open(my $fh, '>>', \\"/some/file.txt\\"); print $fh \\"Some new text \\"; close $fh; Note that when opening and closing file handles, one should always check the return value. =Python= In Python, use the list method \\"extend\\" or the infix operators + and += to append lists. l = [1, 2] l.extend([3, 4, 5]) print l + [6, 7] After executing this code, l is a list containing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], while the output generated is the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Do not confuse with the list method \\"append\\", which adds a single element to a list: l = [1, 2] l.append(3) Here, the result is a list containing [1, 2, 3]. =Bash= In Bash the append redirect is the usage of \\">>\\" for adding a stream to something, like in the following series of shell commands: echo Hello world! >text; echo Goodbye world! >>text; cat text The stream \\"Goodbye world!\\" is added to the text file written in the first command.

Early life  Dean was born in Winstanley Park, Illinois (now part of East St. Louis) on August 25, 1893, the son of William Ware and Rosalie Harriet Dean; his mother's maiden name was Trendley. He received his dental degree from St. Louis University in 1916 and entered private practice that year in Wood River, Illinois. During World War I, he served with the United States Army until 1919, when he returned to his practice. Dean married Ruth Martha McEvoy on September 14, 1921. Also in 1921, he entered the United States Public Health Service and was stationed in several US Marine Corps hospitals until 1931 when he was placed in charge of dental research at the National Institute of Health, advancing to director of the dental research section in 1945. After World War II, he directed epidemiologic studies for the Army in Germany. When Congress established the National Institute of Dental Research in 1948, Dean was appointed its director, a position he held until retiring in 1953.  Research into water fluoridation  Dean's legacy comes almost entirely from his research into fluoridation. At the urging of Dr. Frederick McKay and others concerned with the brown-staining of teeth in certain regions of the country, Dean was asked to make this his first assignment at the Institute in 1931. Dean was part of a team that focused on determining optimal concentrations of fluoride in drinking water that would only cause minimal and mild mottled enamel on the teeth (dental fluorosis), while at the same time precipitating lower rates of dental caries (cavities). In 1934, as part of this work, Dean published an index to categorize the severity of dental fluorosis. In 1939 he reported on children who grew up in 4 nearby Illinois towns: Overall caries in the low fluoride towns were 2-3 times the caries in high fluoride towns. The greatest difference was in cavities between the front teeth, where the low fluoride kids had 16X the caries. The August 1, 1943 Journal of The American Dental Association referenced Dean as acknowledging the difficulty of identifying an optimal concentration with the following quote, \\"The same amount of fluorine that causes a mild toxic reaction in one individual may cause a severe reaction in another. In other words we are dealing with a low-grade chronic poisoning of the formative dental organ in which case some individuals may show a more severe reaction than others having a comparable fluorine intake.\\" Dean's professional life was spent searching for an optimal level of fluoride that would prevent tooth decay yet avoid staining or otherwise damaging teeth. In 1952, McKay and Dean were presented with the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research by the American Public Health Association for their work with fluoride.  Later life  After his retirement, Dean joined the American Dental Association as Secretary of its Council on Dental Research. In this role, he continued to advocate and defend the addition of fluoride to public drinking water. He was frequently called to speak on the subject in the United States and abroad, mostly to refute the arguments of those who opposed water fluoridation. In 1949, he was presented with the Gorgas Medal from the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS). He died in 1962, after a long battle with asthma and emphysema. The International Association for Dental Research has an award named after Dean, called the H. Trendley Dean Memorial Award, recognizing meritorious research in epidemiology and public health.

It was a herbivorous sauropod whose fossils have been found in southern Arizona in the United States. Its name, which means \\"Sonora lizard\\", comes from the Sonoran Desert where its fossils were first found. The type species is S. thompsoni, described by Ratkevich in 1998. Discovery Fossilized remains were discovered in November 1994 by geology student Richard Thompson in the Turney Ranch Formation, located in the Chihuahua Desert region of the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona. Thompson had investigated a previously almost unexplored region, where fossils proved to be plentiful and directly accessible on the surface. A relatively complete sauropod skeleton was weathering out on a rock wall. He informed paleontologist Ronald Paul Ratkevich of the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, Tucson of the find. Ratkevich assembled a team of volunteers and began securing the bones in the spring of 1995; excavations would only end in 1999. He assumed the fossils represented a sauropod but was no expert on that taxon. The curator of geology of the museum, David W. Thayer, thought it might be a therizinosaur, mistaking a tail chevron bone for the long hand claw typical of that group. In 1995, Ratkevich and Tayer first reported the find, already using the name \\"Sonorasaurus\\" but informally, so that it remained a nomen nudum.Thayer D.W. and Ratkevich R., 1995, \\"In progress dinosaur excavation in the mid-cretaceous Turney Ranch Formation, southeastern Arizona\\", Proceedings of the Fossils of Arizona Symposium. Bulletin No.3., Mesa Southwest Museum, Southwest Paleontological Society Both men now asked dinosaur expert Edwin Harris Colbert to identify the animal. Colbert, having seen only pictures, suggested it might be a member of the Hadrosauridae. Ratkevich and Thayer then visited the displays in the American Museum of Natural History, concluding their find was rather dissimilar to the hadrosaurid skeletons shown there, so that it must represent a species new to science. Ratkevich considered naming it \\"Chihuahuasaurus\\" but ultimately shied away from the comical contrast between the gigantic sauropod and the minute dog breed. In 1996, a subsequent article tried to fit the bones found, in a diagram of the hadrosaurid Kritosaurus. This attempt largely failed, with an ilium being mistaken for a shoulder blade. Again, the name \\"Sonorasaurus\\" was used but still invalidly.David W. Thayer, Ronald P. Ratkevich & Stan E. Krzyzanowski, 1996, \\"A new Dinosaur for the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum Tucson, Arizona\\", Rocks & Minerals, 71(1): 34-38 Sonorasaurus was finally formally described in 1998 by Ratkevich, who identified it as a brachiosaurid sauropod. Dating of the specimen found it to be the earliest known brachiosaurid to have lived in the 'middle' Cretaceous Period of North America. On April 10, 2018, Sonorasaurus was declared the state dinosaur of Arizona.http://ktar.com/story/2018935/arizona-officially-names-sonorasaurus- state-dinosaur/ Description The holotype of Sonorasaurus, ASDM 500, is an incomplete skeleton consisting of various postcranial elements, many of which are fragmentary. A complete dorsal rib from the same horizon, ASDM 807, may also be referrable to S. thompsoni. Sonorasaurus is estimated to have been about 15 meters long (49 ft) and tall, about one third of the size of Brachiosaurus. Classification Ratkevich initially identified Sonorasaurus as a brachiosaurid. However phylogenetic studies in the following years failed to find a consensus, with some finding it to lie within Brachiosauridae and others outside of it. In no analysis was the recovered phylogenetic position of Sonorasaurus strongly supported until D'Emic et al. (2016), which found Sonorasaurus to fall confidently within the Brachiosauridae. However the authors noted that additional data was still required to firmly establish its lower-level affinities.

These defects, primarily dislocations, are introduced by plastic deformation of the material and act to increase the yield strength of a material. Since recovery reduces the dislocation density the process is normally accompanied by a reduction in a material's strength and a simultaneous increase in the ductility. As a result, recovery may be considered beneficial or detrimental depending on the circumstances. Recovery is related to the similar process of recrystallization and grain growth, each of them being stages of annealing. Recovery competes with recrystallization, as both are driven by the stored energy, but is also thought to be a necessary prerequisite for the nucleation of recrystallized grains. It is so called because there is a recovery of the electrical conductivity due to a reduction in dislocations. This creates defect-free channels, giving electrons an increased mean-free path. Definition The physical processes that fall under the designations of recovery, recrystallization and grain growth are often difficult to distinguish in a precise manner. Doherty et al. (1998) stated: > \\"The authors have agreed that ... recovery can be defined as all annealing > processes occurring in deformed materials that occur without the migration > of a high-angle grain boundary\\" Thus the process can be differentiated from recrystallization and grain growth as both feature extensive movement of high-angle grain boundaries. If recovery occurs during deformation (a situation that is common in high-temperature processing) then it is referred to as 'dynamic' while recovery that occurs after processing is termed 'static'. The principal difference is that during dynamic recovery, stored energy continues to be introduced even as it is decreased by the recovery process - resulting in a form of dynamic equilibrium. Process Fig 1. The annihilation and reorganisation of an array of edge dislocations in a crystal lattice Fig 2. Animation of the annihilation and reorganisation of edge dislocations in a crystal lattice =Deformed structure= A heavily deformed metal contains a huge number of dislocations predominantly caught up in 'tangles' or 'forests'. Dislocation motion is relatively difficult in a metal with a low stacking fault energy and so the dislocation distribution after deformation is largely random. In contrast, metals with moderate to high stacking fault energy, e.g. aluminum, tend to form a cellular structure where the cell walls consist of rough tangles of dislocations. The interiors of the cells have a correspondingly reduced dislocation density. =Annihilation= Each dislocation is associated with a strain field which contributes some small but finite amount to the materials stored energy. When the temperature is increased - typically below one-third of the absolute melting point - dislocations become mobile and are able to glide, cross-slip and climb. If two dislocations of opposite sign meet then they effectively cancel out and their contribution to the stored energy is removed. When annihilation is complete then only excess dislocation of one kind will remain. =Rearrangement= After annihilation any remaining dislocations can align themselves into ordered arrays where their individual contribution to the stored energy is reduced by the overlapping of their strain fields. The simplest case is that of an array of edge dislocations of identical Burger's vector. This idealized case can be produced by bending a single crystal that will deform on a single slip system (the original experiment performed by Cahn in 1949). The edge dislocations will rearrange themselves into tilt boundaries, a simple example of a low-angle grain boundary. Grain boundary theory predicts that an increase in boundary misorientation will increase the energy of the boundary but decrease the energy per dislocation. Thus, there is a driving force to produce fewer, more highly misoriented boundaries. The situation in highly deformed, polycrystalline materials is naturally more complex. Many dislocations of different Burger's vector can interact to form complex 2-D networks. Development of substructure As mentioned above, the deformed structure is often a 3-D cellular structure with walls consisting of dislocation tangles. As recovery proceeds these cell walls will undergo a transition towards a genuine subgrain structure. This occurs through a gradual elimination of extraneous dislocations and the rearrangement of the remaining dislocations into low-angle grain boundaries. Sub-grain formation is followed by subgrain coarsening where the average size increases while the number of subgrains decreases. This reduces the total area of grain boundary and hence the stored energy in the material. Subgrain coarsen shares many features with grain growth. If the sub-structure can be approximated to an array of spherical subgrains of radius R and boundary energy Œ≥s; the stored energy is uniform; and the force on the boundary is evenly distributed, the driving pressure P is given by: : P = -alpha;R frac{d}{dR} left (frac{gamma;_s}{R} right ) ,! Since Œ≥s is dependent on the boundary misorientation of the surrounding subgrains, the driving pressure generally does not remain constant throughout coarsening.

It is attributed to the biblical Baruch and so is associated with the Old Testament, but not regarded as scripture by Jews or by most Christian groups. It is included in some editions of the Peshitta, and is part of the Bible in the Syriac Orthodox tradition. It has 87 sections (chapters). 2 Baruch is also known as the Apocalypse of Baruch or the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch (used to distinguish it from the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch). The Apocalypse proper occupies the first 77 chapters of the book. Chapters 78‚Äì87 are usually referred to as the Letter of Baruch to the Nine and a Half Tribes. Manuscript tradition The Letter of Baruch had a separate and wider circulation than the rest of the book, and is attested in thirty-six Syriac manuscripts. The Apocalypse proper has been less widely available. One Latin excerpt was known from a quotation in Cyprian.Cyprian Testimoniorum adversus Jud√¶os III.29 includes verses 48:36 48:33‚Äì34 A 4th‚Äì5th century AD Greek fragment was found among the Oxyrhynchus manuscripts.P.

A. Ceriani Apocalypsis Baruch (notae criticae) in Monumenta sacra et profana 1,2, Milano 1866 pag 73‚Äì98 An Arabic manuscript of the whole text was discovered in 1974. It is apparently a rather free translation from a Syriac text similar to the Milan manuscript. Description Although the canonical Book of Jeremiah portrays Baruch as Jeremiah's scribe, 2 Baruch portrays him as a prophet in his own right. It has a style similar to the writings attributed to Jeremiah: a mix of prayer, lamentation, and visions. Although Baruch writes of Nebuchadnezzar's sack of Jerusalem in 586 BC, the book is currently believed to have been written in reaction to the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, but written before 135 AD. The Syriac is almost certainly a translation from the Greek; the original was probably written in Hebrew. There is a close relation between the apocalypse described here and that in 2 Esdras, but critics are divided over the question of which influenced the other. The probabilities favor the hypothesis that that in 2 Baruch is an imitation of that of Esdras and therefore later. This Apocalypse of Baruch deals in part with the same problems, the sufferings of the theocratic people, and their ultimate triumph over their oppressors. Its Messianism, in general, is earthly, but in the latter part of the book the Messiah's realm tends unmistakably towards a more spiritual conception. Greater importance is attached to the law than in the related composition. Some scholars of 2 Baruch have seen in it a composite work, but the majority of critics consider it unified. As in 2 Esdras, sin is traced to the disobedience of Adam, but different stances are taken about the hereditary nature of Adam's sin: while 2 Esdras supports it, 2 Baruch has a quite different position: \\"each of us has been the Adam of his own soul\\" (54:15). The first part of the text is structured in triplets: three fasts, each followed by three visions and three addresses to the people. The visions are notable for their discussion of theodicy, the problem of evil, and an emphasis on predestination. According to the text, the Temple's sacred objects were rescued from destruction under the protection of angels, to be returned during the restoration prophesied in the Book of Jeremiah. The second part of the text is a long letter (known as Letter of Baruch), which many scholars believe was originally a separate document. Content =The Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch= *Chapters 1‚Äì5: God reveals to Baruch the imminent destruction of Jerusalem, and asks him leave the city along with all other pious persons. Baruch cannot understand how the name of Israel can be remembered and the promises made to Moses can come true if the Temple is in ruins. God explains that such an earthly building is not the one he showed to Adam before the Fall and to Moses on Mount Sinai and assures Baruch that Israel's woes will not be permanent. Then Baruch, Jeremiah, and all other pious ones go to the Kidron Valley, where they sorrow and fast. *Chapters 6‚Äì8: On the following day the Chaldeans surround the city, and Baruch is carried up miraculously to the walls of Jerusalem and he sees four angels with torches firing the walls, but not before another angel has consigned the sacred vessels of the Temple to the earth, which swallows them up till the latter days. *Chapters 9‚Äì12: Seven days after the capture of Jerusalem, Baruch again receives a revelation. He is told that Jeremiah should go with the captives to Babylon, but that he himself must remain at the ruins of Jerusalem, where God will reveal to him what shall happen at the end of days. Then Baruch sings a dirge on the destruction of Jerusalem. *Chapters 13‚Äì20: After fasting seven days, Baruch receives a revelation concerning the future punishment of the heathen and of all godless persons; he replies to the Lord complaining about the sad fate of the men. God answers that the man was instructed in the Law and that now the time shall be sped up, referring to the end of days soon to come. *Chapters 21‚Äì30: After another seven-day fast and long prayers, the heavens open and Baruch hears a heavenly voice. First he is blamed for the doubt and the Lord explains that \\"because when Adam sinned and death was decreed against those who should be born, then the multitude of those who should be born was numbered, and for that number a place was prepared where the living might dwell and the dead might be guarded\\", and so the \\"future time\\" will come only when the earth shall have brought forth all her fruit. Baruch demands to know when this time will arrive, and the Lord gives the first description of the \\"future time\\", explaining the twelve divisions of the time of oppression (the same divisions we find in the Ladder of Jacob), and foretelling the Messianic era of joy and the resurrection of the dead. * Chapters 31‚Äì34: Baruch assembles the elders of the people and tells them that Zion will soon be restored, but destroyed once again, then rebuilt for all eternity. * Chapters 35‚Äì40: Baruch, while sitting in the ruins of the Temple lamenting, receives a new revelation in the form of the following vision: in his sleep, he sees a wood surrounded by rocks and crags, and, opposite the wood, a growing vine, beneath which flows a spring. The spring runs quietly as far as the wood, where it waxes to a mighty stream, overwhelming the wood and leaving only one cedar standing. This cedar, too, is finally swept away and carried to the vine. God explains the meaning of the vision to Baruch. The wood is the mighty, fourth power (probably the Roman Empire); the spring is the dominion of the Messiah; and the vine is the Messiah himself, who will destroy the last hostile ruler on Mount Zion. * Chapters 42‚Äì46: The fate of converts and apostates is explained to Baruch, and he is directed to warn the people and to prepare himself for another revelation. He predicts his own death to his son and the other seven elders and * Chapters 47‚Äì52: This central part of the Apocalypse begins with the great prayer of Baruch, full of humility in front of the majesty of God. God reveals to him the oppressions in the latter days, the resurrection, the final destiny of the righteous (\\"there shall then be excellency in the righteous surpassing that in the angels\\"), and the fate of the godless. Thus Baruch understands not to grieve for those who die, but to feel joy for the present sufferance. * Chapters 53‚Äì74: A second prophetic vision follows, whose meaning is explained by the angel Ramiel. A cloud which arises from the sea rains down twelve times, dark and bright waters alternately. This indicates the course of events from Adam to the Messiah. The six dark waters are the dominion of the godless‚ÄîAdam, Ancient Egypt, Canaan, Jeroboam, Manasseh, and the Chaldeans. The six bright waters are Abraham, Moses, David, Hezekiah, Josiah, and the time of the Second Temple (\\"nevertheless, not fully as in the beginning\\"). After these twelve waters comes another water, still darker than the others and shot with fire, carrying annihilation in its wake. A bright flash puts an end to the fearful tempest. The dark cloud is the period between the time of the Second Temple and the advent of the Messiah; the latter event determines the dominion of the wicked, and inaugurates the era of eternal bliss. * Chapters 75‚Äì77: After Baruch has thanked God for the secrets revealed to him, God asks him to warn the people, and keep himself in readiness for his translation to heaven, since God intends to keep him there until the consummation of the times. Baruch admonishes the people and also writes two letters: one to the nine and a half tribes (sent them by means of an eagle); the other to the two and a half tribes exiled in Babylon (of which no content is given). =The Letter of Baruch= * Chapters 78‚Äì87 (known also as Letter of Baruch to the Nine and One-half Tribes): the main themes of this letter are the hope for a future reward after the present sufferance, the speeding up of the times, the constancy of Moses's covenant, and the freedom of man to follow God.

Ma√Ætres et √©l√®ves au Moyen √Çge, Paris, Tallandier, 2006, Chapter IV, \\"The Third Carolingian Renaissance\\", p. 59 sqq Historiography The concept of a renaissance was first applied to the Ottonian period by the German historian Hans Naumann - more precisely, his work published in 1927 grouped the Carolingian and Ottonian periods together under the title Karolingische und ottonische Renaissance (The Carolingian and Ottonian Renaissance).Frankfurt-am-Main, 1927 This was only two years after Erna Patzelt's coining of the term 'Carolingian Renaissance' (Die Karolingische Renaissance: Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Kultur des fr√ºhen Mittelalters, Vienna, 1924), and the same year as Charles H. Haskins published The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (Cambridge Mass., 1927) One of three medieval renaissances, the Ottonian Renaissance began after King Otto's marriage to Adelaide of Italy (951) united the Italian and German kingdoms, and thus brought the West closer to Byzantium. He furthered the cause of Christian (political) unity with his Imperial coronation in 962 by the Pope at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The period is sometimes extended to cover the reign of Emperor Henry II (1014-1024) as well, and, rarely, his Salian successors. The term is generally confined to Imperial court culture conducted in Latin in Germany.Kenneth Sidwell, Reading Medieval Latin (Cambridge University Press, 1995) takes the end of Otto III's reign as the close of the Ottonian Renaissance. - it is sometimes also known as the Renaissance of the 10th Century, P. Rich√©, Les Carolingiens, p. 390 or 10th Century Renaissance, so as to include developments outside Germania, or as the Year 1000 Renewal,P. Rich√© et J. Verger, Des nains sur des √©paules de g√©ants. Ma√Ætres et √©l√®ves au Moyen √Çge, Paris, Tallandier, 2006, p. 68 due to coming right at the end of the 10th century. It was shorter than the preceding Carolingian Renaissance and to a large extent a continuation of it - this has led historians such as Pierre Rich√© to prefer evoking it as a 'third Carolingian renaissance', covering the 10th century and running over into the 11th century, with the 'first Carolingian renaissance' occurring during Charlemagne's own reign and the 'second Carolingian renaissance' happening under his successors.P.

Ma√Ætres et √©l√®ves au Moyen √Çge, Paris, Tallandier, 2006 p. 70 Arts The Ottonian Renaissance is recognized especially in the arts and architecture, invigorated by renewed contact with Constantinople, in some revived cathedral schools, such as that of Archbishop Bruno of Cologne, in the production of illuminated manuscripts from a handful of elite scriptoria, such as Quedlinburg Abbey, founded by Otto in 936, and in political ideology. The Imperial court became the center of religious and spiritual life, led by the example of women of the royal family: Matilda the literate mother of Otto I, his sister Gerberga of Saxony, or his consort Adelaide. The Byzantine influence further increased with the marriage of Otto II with Princess Theophanu, who upon her husband's death in 983 ruled as Empress dowager for her minor son Otto III until 991. After Otto I's Imperial coronation, there emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire in Otto's immediate circle and a reformed church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervor. Ottonian art was a court art, created to confirm a direct Holy and Imperial lineage as a source of legitimized power linked from Constantine and Justinian. In this atmosphere the masterpieces that were created fused the traditions which the new art was based on: paintings from Late Antiquity, the Carolingian period, and Byzantium. In this way, the term is used as an analogue to the Carolingian Renaissance which accompanied Charlemagne's coronation in 800. Emperor Otto II, Registrum Gregorii, Trier, c. 985, 27 √ó 20 cm, Mus√©e Cond√©, Chantilly A small group of Ottonian monasteries received direct sponsorship from the Emperor and bishops and produced some magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts, the premier art form of the time. Corvey produced some of the first manuscripts, followed by the scriptorium at Hildesheim after 1000. The most famous Ottonian scriptorium was at the island monastery of Reichenau on Lake Constance: hardly any other works have formed the image of Ottonian art as much as the miniatures which originated there. One of the greatest Reichenau works was the Codex Egberti, containing narrative miniatures of the life of Christ, the earliest such cycle, in a fusion of styles including Carolingian traditions as well as traces of insular and Byzantine influences. Other well known manuscripts included the Reichenau Evangeliary, the Liuther Codex, the Pericopes of Henry II, the Bamberg Apocalypse and the Hitda Codex. Hroswitha of Gandersheim characterises the changes which took place during the time. She was a nun who composed verse and drama, based on the classical works of Terence. The architecture of the period was also innovative and represents a predecessor to the later Romanesque. Politically, theories of Christian unity and empire thrived, as well as revived classical notions of Imperial grandeur in the West. By Otto II's Greek wife Theophanu, Byzantine iconography entered the West. The globus cruciger became a symbol of kingly power and the Holy Roman Emperors were represented as crowned by Christ in the Byzantine fashion. It was in trying to revive the \\"glory that was Rome\\" that Otto III made the Eternal City his capital and increased in Greco-Roman fashion the ceremony of the court. Schools also revived under the influence of the Dukes of Naples and Capua where the illustrious Bishop St Alfanus I, an imitator of ancient writers, was closely involved in music, astronomy and medicine.Pierre Rich√© et Jacques Verger, Des nains sur des √©paules de g√©ants.

The area originally existed as a township with the council meeting at the Yarrow Bridge pub; this was absorbed into Chorley Rural District in the early 20th century. Duxbury today is home to Duxbury Jubilee Park, Duxbury Golf Course, the woods and the River Yarrow. It was also home to Duxbury Hall, the seat of the Standish family. The estate and grounds still exist with the gardens, stables, coachhouse, 16th century barn and Lodges on Bolton Road and Wigan Lane remaining. The Hall itself was built in the 17th Century, and was demolished to make way for housing in 1957. Many consider the great barn (which remains) to be the original home of the pilgrim father Myles Standish. History Duxbury has existed with this name (Deuksburie, Dokesbirie, etc.) since an Angle named Deowuc settled there in 600-900 AD, before the arrival of Vikings at the latter date. He is believed during the rule of King Offa to have set up a fortified farm known as a burh on land near the present day Saw Mills on Wigan Lane. The first Old Hall was in the south of Duxbury (many believe on the site of Bretters Farm near to the Leeds-Liverpool Canal) and the Elizabethan Hall in the centre of the manor was built c. 1600 (many think this was the home of Myles Standish). Other buildings include game preserves, stables and coachhouses. A peel tower was constructed in the north of Duxbury during the Scottish Wars of Independence where in 1322, Chorley was raided by the Scots. The peel tower was thought to have been built soon afterwards, although documents suggest that it was prier to 1319. The rectangular hall pictured was first built in the 17th century, with many later modifications, but was demolished in the 1950s. The site of the manor is now home of Duxbury Jubilee Golf Course. The Great Hall (known as the barn) is now home of Dodd architects and the stables and coachhouses are home to Glendale Managed services. A conservatory and various other buildings within the manor wall were built for Chorley Rural Council but are now used as staff blocks for the Golf course staff. Duxbury Hall as it looked in 1840 The woodland was home to Duxbury Mill which ground corn. Today only traces can be found deep into the woodland at the edge of Red Bank Lane off Carr Lane on the grounds of the Vertex Centre. The weir and mill race which powered the mill still exist and can be seen from the Yarrow Bridge. As well as the mill four coal mines existed; Duxbury Park, Duxbury, Carr and Yarrow Collieries existed. Duxbury Park's old railway bridge ruins can still be seen on Wigan lane. This means there are many tunnels underneath Duxbury with many now disappeared. The latter three collieries were all located around the grounds of the Marconi factory and Vertex Centre whilst Duxbury Park was located near to Wigan Lane. Some of Duxbury is now part of the Yarrow Valley Park which also includes the nearby Birkacre lodges and the large Burgh estate which was once owned by Duxbury Hall. Today the parkland is home to the Chorley Red Bank Scout Group, who meet at the (St Georges) Red Bank Mission. This building was formerly used to serve the workers of the collieries of Carr Lane.

The operation was to capture the tactically important French town of Falaise and then the smaller towns of Trun and Chambois. This operation was undertaken by the First Canadian Army with the 1st Polish Armoured Division (Genera≈Ç brygady Stanis≈Çaw Maczek) and a British armoured brigade against Army Group B of the Westheer in what became the largest encirclement on the Western Front during the Second World War. Despite a slow start and limited gains north of Falaise, novel tactics by the 1st Polish Armoured Division during the drive for Chambois enabled the Falaise Gap to be partially closed by 19 August 1944, trapping about 150,000 German soldiers in the Falaise Pocket. Although the Falaise Gap was narrowed to a distance of several hundred metres/yards, as a result of attacks and counter-attacks between battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) the gap was not closed quickly and thousands of German troops escaped on foot. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, the Polish forces assisted by artillery-fire, managed to hold off counter- attacks by seven German divisions in hand-to-hand fighting. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket. Background Following break-out by the US 1st and 3rd Armies from the beachhead during the Battle of Normandy after Operation Cobra on 25 July 1944, Adolf Hitler ordered an immediate counterattack against Allied forces in the form of Operation L√ºttich. Lieutenant General Omar Bradley‚Äîthe commanding general of the US 12th Army Group‚Äîwas notified of the counterattack in advance through signals intercepted via Ultra radio intercepts and deciphering and thus prepared his troops and their commanders to defeat this counteroffensive and to encircle as much of the Wehrmacht force as possible. By the afternoon of 7 August, Operation L√ºttich had been defeated by concerted, large-scale fighter-bomber air strikes against the German tanks and trucks. In the process, forces of the German 7th Army became further enveloped by the Allied advance out of Normandy.Van der Vat, p. 163 Following these failed German offensives, the town of Falaise became a major objective of Commonwealth forces, since its capture would cut off virtually all of Generalfeldmarschall G√ºnther von Kluge's Army Group B.D'Este, p. 404 To achieve this, General Harry Crerar, commanding the newly formed Canadian 1st Army and Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds‚Äîcommanding the Canadian II Corps, planned an Anglo-Canadian offensive with the code name of Operation Totalize. This offensive was designed to break through the defences in the Anglo-Canadian sector of the Normandy front.Zuehlke, p. 168 Operation Totalize would rely on an unusual night attack using heavy bombers and the new Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers to achieve a breakthrough of German defences. Despite initial gains on Verri√®res Ridge and near Cintheaux, the Canadian Army's offensive stalled on 9 August, with strong Wehrmacht counterattacks resulting in heavy casualties for the Canadian and Polish armoured and infantry divisions.Bercuson, p. 230 By 10 August, Canadian troops had reached Hill 195, north of Falaise. They were unable to advance farther immediately and they had been unable to capture Falaise. Prelude =Offensive strategy= Allied gains during the Canadian offensives of Operations Totalize and Tractable Operation Tractable incorporated lessons learned from Operation Totalize, notably the effectiveness of mechanized infantry units and tactical bombing raids by heavy bombers.Bercuson, p. 231 Unlike the previous operation, Tractable was launched in daylight. An initial bombing raid was to weaken German defences and was to be followed by an advance by the Canadian 4th Armoured Division on the western flank of Hill 195, while the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division attacked on the eastern flank with the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade in support. Their advance would be protected by a large smokescreen laid down by Canadian artillery. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery hoped that Canadian forces would achieve control of Falaise by midnight on August 14. From there, all three formations would advance towards Trun, east of Falaise, with the additional assistance of the Polish 1st Armoured Division, numbering approximately 10,000 men.McGilvray, p. 52 Once in Trun, a linkup with the American 3rd Army at Chambois could be quickly accomplished.D'Este, p. 429 The main opposition to Simonds's force was the 12th SS Panzer Division, which included the remnants of two infantry divisions. German forces within the Falaise Pocket approached 350,000 men.Bercuson, p. 229 Had surprise been achieved, the Canadians would likely have succeeded in a rapid break- through.D'Este, p. 430 However, on the night of 13/14 August, a Canadian officer lost his way while moving between divisional headquarters. He drove into German lines and was promptly killed. The Germans discovered a copy of Simonds' orders on his body. As a result, the 12th SS Panzer Division placed the bulk of its remaining strength‚Äî500 grenadiers and 15 tanks, along with twelve 8.8 cm PaK 43 anti-tank guns‚ÄîWilmot, p. 419 along the Allies' expected line of approach. Battle =Initial drive for Falaise= Canadian troops with armour support advance cautiously through the streets of Falaise, encountering only light scattered resistance Operation Tractable began at 12:00 on 14 August, when 800 Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers of RAF Bomber Command struck German positions along the front. As with Totalize, many of the bombers mistakenly dropped their bombs short of their targets, causing 400 Polish and Canadian casualties. Covered by a smoke screen laid down by their artillery, two Canadian divisions moved forwards. Although their line of sight was reduced, German units still managed to inflict severe casualties on the Canadian 4th Armoured Division, which included its Armoured Brigade commander Brigadier Leslie Booth, as the division moved south toward Falaise. Throughout the day, continual attacks by the Canadian 4th and Polish 1st Armoured Divisions managed to force a crossing of the Laison River. Limited access to the crossing points over the Dives River allowed counterattacks by the German 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. The town of Potigny fell to Polish forces in the late afternoon. By the end of the first day, elements of the Canadian 3rd and 4th Divisions had reached Point 159, directly north of Falaise, although they had been unable to break into the town. To bolster his offensive, Simonds ordered the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division to move toward the front, with the hope that this reinforcement would be sufficient to enable his divisions to capture the town.Copp. p. 104 Although the first day's progress was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise.Jarymowycz, p. 188 The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions‚Äîwith the support of the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade‚Äîcontinued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun.Bercuson, p. 232 On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two more days to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganise the bulk of his armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket. =16‚Äì19 August= Drives for Trun and Chambois The drive for Trun by Polish and Canadian Armoured Divisions began on 16 August, with preliminary attacks in preparation for an assault against Trun and Chambois. On 17 August, both armoured divisions of the Canadian 1st Army advanced. By early afternoon, the Polish 1st Armoured Division had outflanked the 12th SS Panzer Division, enabling several Polish formations to both reach the 4th Armoured Division's objectives and significantly expand the bridgehead northwest of Trun.Jarymowycz, p. 192 Stanis≈Çaw Maczek‚Äîthe Polish divisional commander‚Äîsplit his forces into three battlegroups each of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion.Stacey, p. 260 One of these struck southwest, cutting off Trun and establishing itself on the high ground dominating the town and the Dives river valley, allowing for a powerful assault by the Canadian 4th Armoured Division on Trun. The town was liberated on the morning of 18 August.Zuehlke, p. 169 As Canadian and Polish forces liberated Trun, Maczek's second armoured battlegroup manoeuvred southeast, capturing Champeaux and anchoring future attacks against Chambois across a front. At its closest, the front was from forces of the US V Corps in the town. By the evening of 18 August, all of Maczek's battlegroups had established themselves directly north of Chambois (one outside of the town, one near Vimoutiers and one at the foot of Hill 262).Stacey, p. 261 With reinforcements quickly arriving from the 4th Canadian 4th Armoured Division, Maczek was in an ideal position to close the gap the following day. The presence of the Polish Armoured Division also alerted Generalfeldmarshall Walther Model of the need to keep the pocket open. Closing the Gap Early on 19 August, LGen Simonds met with his divisional commanders to finalize plans for closing the gap. The 4th Armoured Division would attack toward Chambois, on the western flank of two battlegroups of the Polish 1st Armoured Division. Two additional Polish battlegroups would strike eastward, securing Hill 262 to cover the eastern flanks of the assault. The 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions would continue their grinding offensives against the northern extremities of the Falaise Pocket, inflicting heavy casualties on the exhausted remains of the 12th SS Panzer Division. The assault began almost immediately after the meeting, with one battlegroup of the Polish 1st advancing toward Chambois and \\"Currie Task Force\\" of the 4th Armoured Division covering their advance. Simultaneously, two Polish battlegroups moved for Hill 262. Despite heavy German resistance, Battlegroup Zgorzelski was able to secure Point 137, directly west of Hill 262. By early afternoon, Battlegroup Stefanowicz had captured the hill, annihilating a German infantry company in the process. As a result of the fighting, Polish casualties accounted for nearly 50% of those sustained by the Canadian 1st Army.Jarymowycz, p. 195. By the night of August 18, Polish fatalities totaled 263, while Canadian fatalities totaled 284 By late afternoon of 19 August, Canadian and Polish forces had linked with the US 80th Division and 90th Division already stationed in the town. The Falaise Gap had been closed, trapping Model's forces. As the linkup occurred, Model's II SS Panzer Corps had begun its counterattack against Polish forces on Hill 262, hoping to reopen the pocket. With American and Canadian forces facing German counterattacks in their sectors, the Polish forces would have to defend against two veteran Panzer divisions to keep the gap closed. =20 August= St. Lambert-sur-Dives and Hill 117 German counterattacks against Canadian-Polish positions on 20 August 20, 1944 On the morning of 20 August, two German formations‚Äîthe 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions, attacked Polish positions on Hill 262.Jarymowycz, p. 195 At the same time, the 16th Infantry and 12th SS Panzer Divisions attacked American and Canadian forces from within the pocket, opening small channels through Allied positions. By mid-morning, 2,000 survivors of the German 2nd Parachute Division had managed to breach Canadian positions along the Dives River, as well as at Point 117. At approximately noon, several units of the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions managed to break through these weakened positions.Jarymowycz, p. 196 By mid afternoon, reinforcements from an armoured battlegroup formed from the South Alberta Regiment and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada under Major David Vivian Currie managed to reach St. Lambert-sur-Dives, denying two German armies evacuation of the pocket. Over the next 36 hours, the battlegroup repulsed almost continual attacks by German forces, destroying seven German tanks, twelve anti-tank guns and 40 vehicles. In the brutal fighting around Lambert-sur-Dives, Currie's battlegroup was able to inflict nearly 2,000 casualties on attacking German forces, including 300 killed and 1,100 captured. By the evening of 20 August, the Germans had exhausted their attack against St. Lambert-sur-Dives; the surviving members of the 84th Corps‚Äîcommanded by General Elfeld‚Äîsurrendered to Canadian and American forces near Chambois. For his actions at St. Lambert- sur-Dives, Currie was awarded the Victoria Cross, the only Canadian so honoured for service in the Normandy Campaign. Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) Mont Ormel, 20 August 1944 While Currie's force stalled German forces outside of St. Lambert, two battlegroups of Maczek's Polish 1st Armoured Division were engaged in a protracted battle with two well-trained SS Panzer divisions. Throughout the night of the 19th, Polish forces had entrenched themselves along the south, southwest and northeastern lines of approach to Hill 262.D'Este, p. 456 Directly southwest of Mont Ormel, German units moved along what would later become known as \\"The Corridor of Death\\", as the Polish inflicted heavy casualties on German forces moving towards Mont Ormel with a well-coordinated artillery barrage. The Polish infantry and armour were supported by the guns of the 58th Battery, 4th Medium Regiment, 2nd Canadian Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) and assisted by the Artillery observer, Pierre S√©vigny. Captain Pierre S√©vigny's assistance was crucial in defending Hill 262 and he later received the Virtuti Militari (Poland's highest military decoration) for his exertions during the battle. From the northeast, the 2nd SS Panzer Division planned an assault in force against the four infantry battalions and two armoured regiments of the Polish 1st Armoured Division dug in on Hill 262. The 9th SS Panzer Division would attack from the north, while simultaneously preventing Canadian units from reinforcing the Polish armoured division. Having managed to break out of the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill 262 from the southwest. If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.Fey, p. 175 The first attack against Polish positions was by the \\"Der F√ºhrer\\" Regiment of the 2nd SS Panzer Division. Although the Podhale Rifles battalion was able to repel the attack, it expended a substantial amount of its ammunition in doing so.Jarymowycz, p. 197 The second attack was devastating to the dwindling armoured forces of the Polish battlegroups. A single German tank, positioned on Point 239 (northeast of Mont Ormel), was able to destroy five Sherman medium tanks within two minutes. At this time, the 3rd Parachute Division‚Äîalong with an armoured regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division‚Äîattacked Mont Ormel from inside the Falaise Pocket. This attack was repulsed by the artillery, which \\"massacred\\" German infantry and armour closing in on their positions.Van der Vat, p. 168 As the assault from the southwest ran out of steam, the 2nd SS Panzer Division resumed its attack on the northeast of the ridge. Since Polish units were now concentrated on the southern edges of the position, the 2nd SS was able to force a path through to the 3rd Parachute Division by noon, opening a corridor out of the pocket. By mid-afternoon, close to 10,000 German troops had escaped through the corridor. Despite being overwhelmed by strong counterattacks, Polish forces continued to hold the high ground on Mont Ormel, which they referred to as \\"The Mace\\" (Maczuga), exacting a deadly toll on passing German forces through the use of well-coordinated artillery fire.D'Este, p. 458 Irritated by the presence of these units, which were exacting a heavy toll on his men, Generaloberst Paul Hausser‚Äîcommanding the 7th Army‚Äîordered the positions to be \\"eliminated\\". Although substantial forces, including the 352nd Infantry Division and several battlegroups from the 2nd SS Panzer Division inflicted heavy casualties on the 8th and 9th Battalions of the Polish 1st Armoured Division, the counterattack was ultimately fought off. The battle had cost the Poles almost all of their ammunition, leaving them in a precarious position. At 19:00 on 20 August, a 20-minute ceasefire was arranged to allow German forces to evacuate a large convoy of medical vehicles. Immediately following the passage of these vehicles, the fighting resumed and intensified. Although the Germans were incapable of dislodging the Polish forces, the hill's defenders had reached the point of exhaustion. With ammunition supplies extremely low, the Poles were forced to watch as the remnants of the XLVII Panzer Corps escaped from the pocket. Despite this, Polish artillery continued to bombard every German unit that entered the evacuation corridor. Stefanowicz‚Äîcommander of the Polish battlegroups on Hill 262‚Äîwas sceptical of his force's chance of survival: > Gentlemen. Everything is lost. I do not believe [the] Canadians will manage > to help us. We have only 110 men left, with 50 rounds per gun and 5 rounds > per tank ... Fight to the end! To surrender to the SS is senseless, you know > it well. Gentlemen! Good luck‚Äîtonight, we will die for Poland and > civilization. We will fight to the last platoon, to the last tank, then to > the last man.Jarymowycz, p. 201 =21 August= German forces surrendering in St. Lambert-sur-Dives on 21 August 1944 Night was welcomed by the German and Polish forces surrounding Mont Ormel. Fighting was sporadic, as both sides avoided contact with one another. Frequent Polish artillery barrages interrupted German attempts to retreat from the sector. In the morning, German attacks on the position resumed. Although not as coordinated as on the day before, the attack still managed to reach the last of the Polish defenders on Mont Ormel. As the remaining Polish forces repelled the assault, their tanks were forced to use the last of their ammunition. At approximately 12:00, the last SS remnants launched a final assault on the positions of the 9th Battalion. Polish forces defeated them at point-blank range. There would be no further attacks; the two battlegroups of the Polish 1st Armoured Division had survived the onslaught, despite being surrounded by German forces for three days. Both Reynolds and McGilvray place the Polish losses on the Maczuga at 351 killed and wounded and 11 tanks lost,Reynolds, p. 280 although Jarymowycz gives higher figures of 325 killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing‚Äîapproximately 20% of the division's combat strength. Within an hour, The Canadian Grenadier Guards managed to link up with what remained of Stefanowicz's men. By late afternoon, the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine River.Bercuson, p. 233 The Falaise Gap had been permanently closed, with a large number of German forces still trapped in the pocket.Fey, p. 176 Aftermath By the evening of 21 August 1944, the vast majority of the German forces remaining in the Falaise Pocket had surrendered.Van der Vat, p. 169 Nearly all of the strong German formations that had caused significant damage to the Canadian 1st Army throughout the Normandy campaign had been destroyed. Two panzer divisions‚Äîthe Panzer Lehr and 9th SS‚Äînow existed in name only. The formidable 12th SS Panzer Division had lost 94% of its armour, nearly all of its field-guns and 70% of its vehicles. Several German units, notably the 2nd and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions had managed to escape east toward the Seine River, albeit without most of their motorized equipment. Conservative estimates for the number of German soldiers captured in the Falaise Pocket approach 50,000,D'Este, p. 455 although some estimates put total German losses (killed and captured) in the Pocket as high as 200,000. By 23 August, the remainder of the Wehrmacht's Seventh Army had entrenched itself along the Seine River,Keegan, p. 410 in preparation for the defence of Paris. Simultaneously, elements of Army Group G‚Äîincluding the German 15th Army and the 5th Panzer Army‚Äîmoved to engage American forces in the south. In the following week, elements of the Canadian 1st Army repeatedly attacked these German units on the Seine in attempts to break through to the Channel Ports.Copp, p. 106 On the evening of 23 August, French and American Army units entered Paris.Keegan, p. 414 =Casualties= German equipment destroyed near Mont Ormel Due to the successive offensives of early August, exact Canadian casualties for Operation Tractable are not known. Losses during Totalise and Tractable are put at 5,500 men. Jarymowycz, p. 203 German casualties during Operation Tractable are also uncertain; approximate figures can be found for casualties within the Falaise Pocket but not for the Canadian operations during Tractable. After the Falaise Pocket, the German 7th Army was severely depleted, having lost from 50,000‚Äì200,000 men, over 200 tanks, 1,000 guns and 5,000 other vehicles. In the fighting around the Germans lost 2,000 men killed, 5,000 taken prisoner, 55 tanks, 152 other armoured vehicles and 44 guns.McGilvray, p. 54 Polish casualties for Operation Tractable (until 22 August) are 1,441 men, of whom 325 were killed (including 21 officers), 1,002 were wounded (35 officers) and 114 missing, which includes 263 men lost before the Chambois and Ormel actions from 14 to 18 August. =Battle honours= In the British and Commonwealth system of battle honours, participation in Operation Tractable (included as part of the honour Falaise for service from 7 to 22 August) was recognized in 1957, 1958, and 1959 by the award of the battle honours Laison (or \\"The Laison\\" for Canadian units), for service from 14 to 17 August, Chambois from 18 to 22 August and St Lambert-sur-Dives from 19 to 22 August.Rodger, 2003, p. 248 Notes =Footnotes= =Citations= References ;Books * Bercuson, David (1995) Maple leaf Against the Axis.

As of May 2016 he held the position of Technical Director at the IFAB. During his career as a prominent referee in England, Elleray officiated a number of notable matches, including the FA Cup Final, the highest domestic honour for an English referee. Due to his Oxbridge background and \\"day job\\" as a teacher at a public school, Elleray has been described as \\"schoolmasterly\\" and \\"posh\\" by the press. His teaching role entailed time conflicts with his role as a leading referee before his retirement. Early life Elleray was educated at Dover Grammar School for Boys where he excelled at a range of sports and started refereeing football games at the age of 13 to earn extra pocket money. He won a scholarship to read geography at Hertford College, Oxford and was a keen rugby player and rower. While at university, he was promoted through the Hellenic, Isthmian and Panel Leagues and eventually become a The Football League referee in 1986. He remained there until his inclusion on the original Premier League Referees' List in 1992, and also became a FIFA referee in that year.Interview: Singer & Friedlander (at the University of Leicester). Career Elleray is a career geography teacher and spent over 30 years at Harrow School, where he held various leadership roles such as head of geography, director of boarding, and housemaster of Druries House before his retirement in 2009. Early in his teaching career, he was noted for controversially reintroducing football (which had not been played there since 1927) at Harrow - a school better known for its rugby and cricket traditions - in 1977.Old Harrovians Association FC history Elleray stepped down as a FIFA- listed referee in 1999, having officiated 78 international matches in 35 countries. He officiated at Wembley Stadium 13 times but was unable to officiate at the 1998 World Cup in France due to school commitments. During his refereeing career, Elleray is remembered for a number of incidents, including awarding a dubious penalty kick to Manchester United in the 1994 FA Cup Final against Chelsea.Controversial penalty to Man Utd, 1994 FA Cup Final, v. Chelsea: match details from ManUtdZone.com website. Elleray later admitted in his autobiography that he \\"blew without thinking\\" and although he knew he had made a mistake, he could not change his mind. He was also the referee when Ryan Giggs scored his 'wonder goal' in the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay against Arsenal at Villa Park, and when David Beckham scored from inside his own half against Wimbledon in 1996. Even though he sent-off Manchester United's Roy Keane four times, when he retired Keane sent him a letter wishing him well and a signed jersey. Elleray was recognised by coaches, players and fans for being a firm, fair and consistent referee. After the 1994 FA Cup Final, UEFA president Lennart Johansson told Elleray: \\"Europe needs referees like you. I do not care whether the second penalty was a foul or not. The easy decision would to have given nothing. You showed strength and courage. Congratulations!\\" In 1999 Elleray had death threats from Manchester United supporters after Liverpool made a comeback which could have prevented their team winning the title. He awarded Liverpool a dubious penalty and then sent Denis Irwin off for attempting a pass because he hadn't seen the official's flag, allowing Liverpool to bring the game to 2-2. Martin Edwards, the United chairman, claimed that a medal should be struck for Elleray should Arsenal win the league. The result however did not impact United's pole position or winning the title that season due to Arsenal losing at Leeds a few days later so therefore not taking advantage. It was a long time before Elleray refereed United again. In 2002 Elleray was voted onto the FA Council as the member for Independent Schools.Biographical quotes: Forum at OfficialSports.co.uk website. He retired from refereeing at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. His last match was Newcastle United's 1‚Äì0 win over Birmingham on 3 May 2003, during which he sent-off Blues defender Matthew Upson.Last ever match as referee, Newcastle v. Birmingham, 2003: soccerbase.com website. Post-retirement In 2004 Elleray accepted the position as Honorary President of the Board of the Referees' Association of England for three years, and was a FIFA and UEFA referee assessor and instructor. He was chairman of the Independent Schools Football Association. Elleray was awarded an honorary doctorate from Sheffield Hallam University in 2010. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to football. He has held the position of Technical Director for the International Football Association Board since at least May 2016.

Scholars disagree on whether it was written by a Jew or a Christian, or whether a clear distinction can be made in this era. It is one of the Pseudepigrapha, attributed to the 6th-century BC scribe of Jeremiah, Baruch ben Neriah, and does not form part of the biblical canon of either Jews or Christians. It survives in certain Greek manuscripts, and also in a few Old Church Slavonic ones.  Content  Like 2 Baruch, this Greek Apocalypse of Baruch describes the state of Jerusalem after the sack by Nebuchadnezzar in 587 BC and discusses how Jerusalem can survive when the temple is no longer in existence. It frames this discussion as a mystical vision granted to Baruch ben Neriah. Also like 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch argues that the Temple has been preserved in heaven and is presented as fully functional and attended by angels; thus there is no need for the temple to be rebuilt on earth. This third book of Baruch addresses the question of why God permits good people to suffer, and answering with a vision of the afterlife in which sinners and the righteous get their just rewards. During the vision, Baruch is shown various heavens,This literary trope of Apocalyptic literature is discussed by there witnessing the punishment of the builders of the \\"tower of strife against God\\" (perhaps the Tower of Babel); a serpent named Hades who drinks from the sea; and other such marvels, until he is finally stopped by a locked gate at the fifth heaven, which only the archangel Michael has the ability to open. The builders of the \\"tower of strife\\" are described in terms that could be regarded as demonic - with the faces of cattle, horns of sheep, and feet of goats; while those who commanded them to build it are punished eternally in a separate heaven where they are reincarnated in the forms of dogs, bears or apes. Baruch also witnesses a phoenix, which the text portrays as a massive singular bird that protects the earth from the rays of the sun.  Origins  Lee asserts that the text was originally written in Greek by someone with a Semitic background. Other scholars find significant that the Old Church Slavonic versions do not contain the Christian overtones of the Greek text and conclude that the extant Greek text represents a rewriting in the Christian age.

Romania was mostly occupied by the Central Powers, but the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti kept the northeastern region of the country free from occupation. Background On July 22, 1917, the Romanians launched a joint offensive with Russia against the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, around MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti and the lower part of the Siret river, which resulted in the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti. Although there was some initial success, a counter- offensive by the Central Powers in Galicia stopped the Romanian-Russian offensive. Battle The Central Powers planned a dual pincer movement attack: an offensive towards Adjud and an offensive towards Oituz. The Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti was fought between 6 August and 3 September, in an area marked by the towns of Foc»ôani, Panciu and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, along the Siret River. West of the Siret, the German 9th Army had 12 divisions with 102 infantry battalions, 10 cavalry squadrons and 213 artillery batteries (31 heavy). Facing the Germans was the Russian 4th Army. Its defenses were still under construction, discontinuous, and lacked depth. The Russian troops were being replaced by the Romanian 1st Army, under General Constantin Cristescu. The Romanian 1st Army had 78 infantry battalions, 58 cavalry squadrons, 114 gun and light howitzer batteries, 36 heavy batteries, 10 trench mortars, 5 air squadrons and 7 anti- aircraft guns. To these the Russian 4th Army added 84 infantry battalions, 32 cavalry squadrons and 79 artillery batteries (9 heavy). The German offensive began on the night of 5-6 August, with a violent 8 hours-long artillery bombardment which included poison gas shells. Striking between the Siret and the Foc»ôani-MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti railroad, the Germans 3-10 km (1.8-6.2 miles) northwards against the left flank of the Russian 4th Army. Although they left behind their artillery, the Russians managed to destroy the bridges over the river. The intervention of the 5th Romanian Division in this threatened sector stabilized the situation, shelling the left flank of the Germans as they attempted to cross the river along with the Russians. The following day, however, the Romanians lost the village of Doaga. During a subsequent Romanian-Russian counterattack against 4 German divisions, the Russians managed to advance 3 km (1.8 miles) and the Romanians 1-2 km (0.6-1.2 miles). However, the Russians were driven back during the following night, driving a 4-5 km (2.5-3.1 miles) wedge between the Romanian 9th Division and the Russian 71st Division, whose combat power was collapsing as whole units abandoned their positions. The commander of the Russian 4th Army decided to delay the counterattack, allowing the Germans to advance towards MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and threaten the rear of the Romanian 9th Division. Communication between the two Allied armies was restored by the infantry and artillery of the Romanian 13th Division. By the end of the day, the German counterattack forced the Romanians and Russians to abandon their recently made gains. This Allied counteroffensive, between 10 and 11 August, did not yield notable results, apart from the casualties inflicted upon the Central Powers, although at the cost of heavy Russian and Romanian casualties. On 12-13 August two more Romanian divisions were committed to battle. The Romanian resistance forced the German 9th Army to shift the focus of its offensive to the junction between the Russian 4th and Romanian 1st Armies, hoping to coordinate its attack with the one delivered by the Gerok Group at Oituz. On the morning of 14 August, after a powerful artillery bombardment with high explosive and gas shells, the Germans attacked the Russian troops at Panciu and pushed them back, threatening the left flank of the Romanian 2nd Army at Oituz. The attempt to seize MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, at the left flank of the Romanian 1st Army (commanded by General Eremia Grigorescu since 12 August) failed. On the next day, German troops advancing southeast of Panciu were halted by units of the Romanian 1st Army, supported by accurate Romanian-Russian artillery fire. German prisoners reported extremely heavy casualties, stating that they \\"had not come across such stiff resistance since the battles of the Somme and Verdun\\". On 16 August Romanian troops checked a German advance north of Panciu. Between 17 and 18 August, besides some local skirmishes, the forces in the field mainly regrouped. The Romanian 1st Army deployed 53 Romanian and 21 Russian light batteries and 19 heavy batteries. On 19 August, the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti reached its peak, the German attack being simultaneous with the attack from Oituz, obviously attempting to encircle the Romanian and Russian forces. The formidable artillery bombardment began at daybreak, with gas shells fired mainly against the Romanian divisions. The Central Powers attacked with 4 German and 1 Austro-Hungarian divisions, against the Romanian 9th, 10th and 13th and Russian 14th and 103rd Divisions. The main blow was directed 3 km (1.8 miles) east of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, and the Germans advanced 2 km (1.2 miles) in the middle of the Romanian position, towards the Siret Valley, only to be pushed back with heavy losses by a converging counterattack. Guided by aircraft and balloons observation, the Romanian artillery inflicted heavy losses in combat and materiel. The Germans launched a powerful attack on MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, but only reached the railway station on the outskirts of the town. On 22 August, the Central Powers ceased their offensive, organized for defense, and settled into trench warfare.Sanders Marble, Brill, 2016, King of Battle: Artillery in World War I, pp. 343-349 On 23 August, the Germans started bringing up more artillery. On 28 August, Mackensen launched another attack, causing the Russians to leave the battlefield in large numbers after showing little resistance. The Romanians were able to reinforce their lines before Mackensen could exploit the Russian collapse, completely stopping his advance. This was the most important battle ever fought by the Romanian Army, as it managed to completely stop Mackensen's intended invasion of Moldavia.Ian V. Hogg, Scarecrow Press, Sep 15, 2009, The A to Z of World War I, p. 128 Mackensen halted the attack on 3 September in order to transfer troops to the Italian Front. The Germans had pushed forward 6-7 km (3.7-4.3 miles) along a front of 30 km (18.6 miles), but at great cost and without achieving any major objective. German casualties (killed, wounded and missing) amounted to around 60,000 men, while Romanian casualties amounted to 27,000.Keith Hitchins, Clarendon Press, 1994, Rumania 1866-1947, p. 269 Aftermath In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk after Austrian-German forces had captured huge territories in the Baltics, Belarus, and Ukraine in February. This left Romania surrounded by the Central Powers, forcing them to sign the Treaty of Bucharest.

He gave particular praise to Clark Gregg saying that, whilst one is never in doubt about his gender because of his physical appearance, \\"in his heart he knows he is a woman, and he is true to that inner conviction with a courage that the film doesn't need to underline, because it permeates the performance\\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised Adam Greiner's performance feeling that it \\"beautifully captures his character's precarious balance of naivete and bravado, self- destructiveness and self-invention\\". Writing in Variety, Joe Leydon believed that the scenes between Gregg and Grenier were the strongest (although he felt that Gregg's portrayal came close to caricature). He was critical of the technical aspects of the film's production, felt that other films had covered similar ground better and that the ending was poorly conceived and too abrupt. He predicted that the film would perform poorly with critics and at the box office. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman gave the film a \\"B\\" rating, adding that he wished it had been better structured, although the current configuration was \\"integral\\" to its \\"charm\\".

Sanford is a fictional character portrayed by actor/comedian Redd Foxx on the 1972‚Äì1977 NBC sitcom Sanford and Son and the 1980‚Äì1981 NBC sitcom Sanford. Foxx, whose real name was John Elroy Sanford, modeled the character after his real-life older brother, Fred Glenn Sanford (Fred died in 1965, seven years before the show premiered). The role is an adaptation from Albert Steptoe (Wilfrid Brambell) of the series' forebear, Steptoe and Son. The character Fred is an elderly, widowed, sarcastic, and cantankerous junk dealer. He is the proprietor of \\"Sanford and Son\\", a junk and antique dealership which he runs out of his home, along with his son Lamont. Foxx appeared in all episodes of the series except nine (due to a contract dispute Foxx had with NBC) in 1974. In 1999 TV Guide ranked him #36 on its list of the 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time. Background Fred G. Sanford was born in St. Louis, Missouri on January 20, 1907 (the episode \\"Happy Birthday, Pop\\" celebrated his 65th birthday that aired in 1972). In 1946, he, his wife Elizabeth Winfield and their son Lamont (Demond Wilson) moved to the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. Fred was left with the responsibility of rearing Lamont alone after his wife suddenly died several years later. Lamont dropped out of high school, subsequently joining his father in the junk business. Lamont, as he was known, was actually his middle name; Fred and Elizabeth could never decide on a first name. (In another episode, Lamont was known as \\"Lamont Grady Sanford\\".) Fred is portrayed as being irritable and wanting everything done his way. He is known for grouchy disposition, his bad cooking, and his innumerable delusions of grandeur. He is bow-legged and walks with an affected stagger, presumably brought on by his (self-diagnosed) arthritis. Fred never gives much credit to his son Lamont, believing him to be gullible and unintelligent (often referring to Lamont as a \\"big dummy\\"). Unhappy about his calling as a junk man, Lamont accepts his plight more for the love of his father than the junk business itself. Fred often involves himself in various get-rich-quick schemes, and as such, Lamont has to keep constant watch over his father. When Lamont would express an interest in having a life for himself, Fred would try to convince him of the importance of running the family business (which he referred to as \\"the empire\\") after he is gone. Fred often feigned illness in attempt to guilt his son into staying home and taking care of him whenever Lamont had plans to go out. Similarly, Fred often ruined Lamont's efforts to have a quiet romantic night at home with a lady companion (at one point, Fred repeatedly interrupted Lamont's amorous efforts so often that the young lady ended up sneaking away while Fred and Lamont argued loudly in the kitchen). Despite his antics, Fred loves and shows concern for Lamont. He also occasionally displays the street smarts he learned growing up in St. Louis. For example, in an episode where Lamont unwittingly invites two card sharps to the house to play poker, Lamont ignores Fred's warnings and loses all his money. Fred, pretending to be foolish, convinces the sharps to let him play a few rounds and proceeds to win all of the money by means of a rigged deck of cards. Personality =Reactions= When asked over the phone for his name, he frequently responds, \\"Fred Sanford. That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D period\\" or \\"Fred G. Sanford. The 'G' is for...\\", with \\"G\\" standing for a word applicable to the situation. Some instances have included \\"gonna cry\\", \\"genius\\", \\"gee\\", \\"grandpa\\",\\"gompergoo\\" and as Lamont himself once said in the episode, \\"The Reverend Sanford\\", \\"Glory glory, Hallelujah\\". It is never revealed what the \\"G\\" actually stands for in his name, though it is possible that it could mean \\"Glen\\", the middle name of Foxx's real-life brother. Another trademark involves Fred becoming riled by somebody, assuming a fight stance, and wildly swinging his fists in multiple directions; often he would pose the question, \\"How would you like one across yo' lip?\\" or, with fist raised, \\"How would you like one of these where you sneeze?\\". He also frequently attempts to avoid any kind of labor, especially when asked by Lamont, by referring to his arthritis (which he pronounced \\"arthur-itis\\") while holding up a deliberately gnarled fist. When Lamont asks him what he does all day while he is out on the truck, Fred often says, \\"Coordinate.\\" Fred spends much of his free time watching television (having an affinity for daikaiju films such as the Godzilla series) and drinking a favorite cheap wine called Ripple. Ripple is a frequent joke as well as often Fred comes up with weird combinations of Ripple and other alcoholic beverages, like with champagne (\\"Champiple\\"), or cranberry juice (\\"Cripple\\"), or a French wine called Beaujolais (\\"Beaujolipple\\"). He even once developed a taste for Sangria wine, calling it \\"Flapple\\" because he felt it tasted like flat Ripple. Another recurring joke is his poor vision; whenever he gets ready to make a phone call, he opens a drawer under the phone and pulls out several pairs of glasses (to help him see the phone dial) and tries each one on. (The pair he picks usually does not improve his vision, anyway.) He, along with Lamont, also often kept valuables or stashes of cash in a secret drawer in that same chest of drawers, which would open after a series of knocks on the dresser and/or foot stamps on the floor. (While Lamont usually pounded on the top of the chest three times, then once on the side, Fred often did various weird combinations to open it.) In what would become the character's best known trademark, when something would alarm him, or when things did not go the way he wanted them, Fred would inevitably have a simulated heart attack, accentuated by clutching his chest and crying out to his late wife, \\"Oh, this is the big one! You hear that, Elizabeth?! I'm coming to join you, honey!\\" (When Lena Horne guested on the program, and Lamont saw her, he reacted the same way: \\"I think I'm havin' one, pop! My first one and it's a big one...you hear that, mom? Your little boy's comin' to join ya...with a mustache!\\") Fred often clashed with Elizabeth's older sister, Lamont's aunt Esther Anderson (LaWanda Page). Aunt Esther and her family had opposed Fred marrying Elizabeth from the very beginning, and Fred and Esther continue their mutual animosity unabated, despite the best efforts of Lamont. Fred makes a habit of teasing Esther because he thinks she is unattractive (Fred once told Esther, \\"I could stick your face in some dough and make gorilla cookies!\\"). For her own part, Esther took no sass from Fred, often referring to him as a \\"heathen\\", \\"sucka\\", and \\"fish-eyed fool\\", and she often tried to use her Bible to change Fred's ways (both figuratively and literally; Esther both quoted from the Bible and also often tried to whack Fred with the heavy purse that she carried it in). Much of the show's comedy came from the interplay between opinionated Fred and his strong-willed sister-in-law. =Prejudices= Throughout the series' run, Fred was often portrayed as being prejudiced himself. He often insults his Puerto Rican neighbor Julio in various ways, including deprecating his culture and making fun of his accent. He also insults Lamont's Asian friend, Ah Chew, calling him \\"Choo Choo\\" and threatening to \\"really close peanut butter jar\\" when Ah Chew attempted to hug him. He states at one point that \\"ain't nothin' on earth uglier than a 90-year-old white woman.\\" His ignorance towards other cultures causes him a severe embarrassment when a Japanese family, interested in buying Fred's land, invites him and Lamont to dinner. The grown daughter sees him eating what he mistakenly thinks are grapes, and smiles \\"Oh, Mr. Sanford! I am so happy! You like the fish eyes!\\" Perhaps the biggest affront to Fred's sensibilities came when he discovered his beloved younger sister‚Äîwhom he had raised himself after their parents died‚Äîhad married a white man (who was also extremely fond of hugging, further earning him Fred's ire). Sometimes even being African-American did not help with Fred, as he was very untrusting of Lamont's friend Rollo (Nathaniel Taylor) often referring to him as a convict because of his style. Despite this, one of Fred's closest friends during the series was a Jewish man named Goldstein; at one point, Fred dons a yarmulke in order to go over to Goldstein's house and eat chicken soup. During a later episode, Fred attempts to trace his family tree and is mistakenly led to believe he has Jewish ancestry. =Relationships with women= Fred was depicted as having an eye for the ladies. In addition to his longtime girlfriend Donna, Fred attempted to hook up with topless waitress \\"Fast\\" Fanny, a traveling saleswoman named Carol, and even celebrities such as Lena Horne and Della Reese. Fred wasted no opportunities to flirt with attractive women regardless of location or situation, such as nurses (at the clinic where he got screened for tuberculosis, Fred remarked that a nurse had \\"TB...Terrific Body!\\"; similarly, when an attractive nurse came into his hospital room offering a back rub to calm him down, Fred immediately began primping once she left the room), stewardesses (a running gag in the episode where Fred takes his first plane trip involved his constant leering at the attractive stewardess whenever she walked away), and receptionists (when the receptionist at the dental clinic said \\"I just need to have you answer a few questions,\\" Fred came back with \\"And may I ask you one or two questions as well.\\") Lamont once remarked to Fred, \\"You're just a dirty old man!\\"; Fred immediately replied, \\"And I'm gonna be one until I'm a dead old man.\\" Sometimes, it could come back to bite him, as a woman he once wooed over a few too many drinks came looking for him during the episode, \\"Will the Real Fred Sanford Please Do Something\\" (one of the episodes filmed in Foxx's absence), to take him up on a wedding proposal, and is stuck thinking every person in the room is Fred at one point, starting with Grady and ending with the Caucasian Hoppy (who was rather amused by this), before finally being taken away by Hoppy and Smitty. (Though Lamont, once it was all over, said he was going to have a talk with Fred about this when he gets back, it was completely forgotten.) =Friendships= Fred has had many friends in the neighborhood, starting with Melvin (Slappy White), and a lot of others, like Leroy, Skillet, etc. from the pool hall. However, his two best friends are Grady Wilson (Whitman Mayo) and Bubba Bexley (Don Bexley). Even though Fred thinks the two are dim witted, he knows that they are more than reliable and can always lend him a helping hand.
