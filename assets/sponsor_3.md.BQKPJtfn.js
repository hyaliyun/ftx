Early life Ogunbiyi was born in Rochester, New York to Lai, a pharmacologist from Nigeria, and Elaine Ogunbiyi, a biochemist from Jamaica. He is one of three children in his family; his younger brother Ayotunde played soccer at University of New Hampshire and Ocean City Barons in the USL Premier Development League (PDL) while his elder sister Temitayo, is an artist. Ogunbiyi attended Wissahickon High School in Ambler, Pennsylvania. While at high school he played basketball as a forward as well as soccer as a defender. In soccer he lettered three years and was team captain in his senior year. He attended the Pepsi Football Academy as a youth and was a three-time most valuable player. Career =College= Ogunbiyi attended Santa Clara University. During his time with the Broncos, he also played as a forward and scored 11 goals in 77 total appearances with the team. He played the Broncos' West Coast Conference championship-winning teams in 2006 and 2007. Ogunbiyi while with Viborg FF =Club= Ogunbiyi was drafted by the New York Red Bulls in the 2009 MLS SuperDraft. When he was drafted, New York officials cited his size - six foot, four inches and 212 pounds - as a potential asset. After refusing a developmental contract he and the club were unable agree to a deal. He chose to continue his senior year at college. In April 2009, Ogunbiyi had an unsuccessful trial with English club Leeds United, later trialing with Oldham Athletic in July 2009. In 2010, Ogunbiyi signed for Viborg FF of the Danish 1st Division. Babajide was spotted by Viborg great Steffen Højer while he was on trial with Odense Boldklub in a match against FC Fredericia. Højer was impressed by Babajide and offered him a trial with Viborg, this resulted in the defender signing his first professional contract with the club in August 2010. In June 2011 Babajide went on a three-day trial with German club Karlsruher SC, however the clubs were unable to agree on a transfer fee and he returned to Viborg. In two and a half seasons with Viborg Babajide appeared in 53 matches for the team in total, 52 league and one cup, scoring six goals. He had his best season for Viborg during the 2010–11 campaign in which he managed to score 5 goals in 28 league matches for the Danish side and was named as the club's player of the year. He was also named in the 1st Division team of the year for the 2010–11 season. While in Denmark, Ogunbiyi wrote a regular column for Goal.com focusing on his observations of living in Denmark as a foreigner. Ogunbiyi signed a contract for the New York Red Bulls following a trial with the club in July 2012. However, weeks later, he was released for health reasons.

The airways and lungs receive continuous first-pass exposure to non- toxic and irritant or toxic gases via inhalation. Irritant gases are those that, on inhalation, dissolve in the water of the respiratory tract mucosa and provoke an inflammatory response, usually from the release of acidic or alkaline radicals.Bessac BF, Jordt SE. (2010) Sensory detection and responses to toxic gases: mechanisms, health effects, and countermeasures. Proc Am Thorac Soc. 7: 269-77.do Pico GA. (1995) Toxic gas inhalation. Curr Opin Pulm Med. 1:102-8. Smoke, chlorine, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are common irritants. Depending on the type and amount of irritant gas inhaled, victims can experience symptoms ranging from minor respiratory discomfort to acute airway and lung injury and even death. A common response cascade to a variety of irritant gases includes inflammation, edema and epithelial sloughing, which if left untreated can result in scar formation and pulmonary and airway remodeling. Currently, mechanical ventilation remains the therapeutic mainstay for pulmonary dysfunction following acute inhalation injury.  Causes  =Smoke inhalation= Smoke inhalation injury, either by itself but more so in the presence of body surface burn, can result in severe lung-induced morbidity and mortality.Clark WR Jr. (1992) Smoke inhalation: diagnosis and treatment. World J Surg. 16: 24-9. The most common cause of death in burn centers is now respiratory failure. The September 11 attacks in 2001 and forest fires in U.S. states such as California and Nevada are examples of incidents that have caused smoke inhalation injury.Mauer MP, Cummings KR. (2010) Impulse oscillometry and respiratory symptoms in World Trade Center responders, 6 years post-9/11. Lung 188:107-13.Buyantseva LV, Tulchinsky M, Kapalka GM, Chinchilli VM, Qian Z, Gillio R, Roberts A, Bascom. (2007) Evolution of lower respiratory symptoms in New York police officers after 9/11: a prospective longitudinal study. Occup Environ Med. 49:310-7. Injury to the lungs and airways is not only due to deposition of fine particulate soot but also due to the gaseous components of smoke, which include phosgene, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. =Chlorine= Chlorine is a relatively common gas in industry with a variety of uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a bleaching agent during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including bleach, contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an accidental spill or a deliberate attack. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that a person wear splash proof goggles, a face shield and a respirator mask when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form hypochlorous acid, which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure.Martin JG, Campbell HR, Iijima H, Gautrin D, Malo JL, Eidelman DH, Hamid Q, Maghni K. (2003). Chlorine-induced injury to the airways in mice, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 168:568-74.Matalon S, Maull EA. (2010) Understanding and treating chlorine-induced lung injury. Proc Am Thorac Soc. 7: 253 Chlorine’s odor provides early warning signs of exposure but causes olfactory fatigue or adaptations, reducing awareness of exposure at low concentrations. With increased exposure, symptoms may progress to labored respirations, severe coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and bronchospasm associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation level. .Kennedy SM, Enarson DA, Janssen RG, Chan-Yeung M. (1991) Lung health consequences of reported accidental chlorine gas exposures among pulpmill workers. Am Rev Respir Dis. 143:74-9. Severe exposure may result in changes in upper and lower airways resulting in an acute lung injury, which may not be present until several hours after exposure. A recent chlorine gas leak in Pune, India, landed 20 individuals in the hospital. Though that was an accidental exposure, chlorine gas has been used as a weapon of warfare since World War I, most recently in 2007 in Iraq. =Phosgene= Phosgene, notably used as a chemical weapon during World War I, is also used as an industrial reagent and building block in synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. Because of safety issues, phosgene is almost always produced and consumed within the same plant and extraordinary measures are made to contain this gas. In low concentrations, phosgene’s odor resembles freshly cut hay or grass. Because of this, the gas may not be noticed and symptoms may appear slowly. Phosgene directly reacts with amine, sulfhydryl, and alcohol groups, adversely affecting cell macromolecules and metabolism. The direct toxicity to the cells leads to an increase in capillary permeability.Grainge C, Rice P. (2010) Management of phosgene-induced acute lung injury. Clin Toxicol. 48:497-508.Gift JS, McGaughy R, Singh DV, Sonawane B. (2008)Health assessment of phosgene: approaches for derivation of reference concentration. Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 51:98-107 Furthermore, when phosgene hydrolyzes it forms hydrochloric acid, which can damage the cell surface and cause cell death in the alveoli and bronchioles. The hydrochloric acid triggers an inflammatory response that attracts neutrophils to the lungs, which causes pulmonary edema.Lazarus AA, Devereaux A. (2002) Potential agents of chemical warfare. Worst-case scenario protection and decontamination methods. Postgrad Med. 112:133-40. =Ammonia= Ammonia is generally used in household cleaning products, as well as on farms and in some industrial and commercial locations, and this makes it easy for accidental or deliberate exposure to occur.Lalić H, Djindjić-Pavicić M, Kukuljan M. (2009) Ammonia intoxication on workplace--case report and a review of literature. Coll Antropol. 33:945-9.Weiss SM, Lakshminarayan S. (1994) Acute inhalation injury. Clin Chest Med. 15:103-16.Witschi H. (1977) Environmental agents altering lung biochemistry. Fed Proc. 36:1631-4. Ammonia interacts with moist surfaces to form ammonium hydroxide, which causes necrosis of tissues. Exposure to high concentrations can cause bronchiolar and alveolar edema and airway destruction resulting in respiratory distress or failure. Although ammonia has a pungent odor, it also causes olfactory fatigue or adaptation, reducing awareness of prolonged exposure. =Mustard gas= Sulfur mustard, commonly known as mustard gas, was used as a chemical weapon in World War I and more recently in the Iran–Iraq War. Sulfur mustard is a vesicant alkylating agent with strong cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic properties. After exposure, victims show skin irritations and blisters.Adelipour M, Imani Fooladi AA, Yazdani S, Vahedi E, Ghanei M, Nourani MR. (2011) Smad molecules expression pattern in human bronchial airway induced by sulfur mustard. Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol. 10:147-54.Ghabili K, Agutter PS, Ghanei M, Ansarin K, Panahi Y, Shoja MM. (2011) Sulfur mustard toxicity: history, chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Crit Rev Toxicol. 41:384-403. This agent also causes respiratory tract lesions, bone marrow depression, and eye damage, the epithelial tissues of these organs being predominately affected. Inhalation of high doses of this gas causes lesions in the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi with inflammatory reactions and necrosis. The alkylating agent affects more the upper parts of the respiratory tract, and only intensely exposed victims showed signs like bronchiolitis obliterans in the distal part. Secondary effects of sulfur mustard exposure lead to chronic lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis. =Chloramine= A common exposure involves accidental mixing of household ammonia with cleansers containing bleach, causing the irritant gas monochloramine to be released. =Methyl isocyanate= Methyl isocyanate is an intermediate chemical in the production of carbamate pesticides (such as carbaryl, carbofuran, methomyl, and aldicarb).Mansour SA. (2004) Pesticide exposure--Egyptian scene. Toxicology 198: 91-115.Beckett WS. (1998) Persistent respiratory effects in survivors of the Bhopal disaster. Thorax 53:S43-6. It has also been used in the production of rubbers and adhesives. As a highly toxic and irritating material, it is hazardous to human health, and was involved in the Bhopal disaster—which killed nearly 8,000 people initially and approximately 17,000 people in total.Beckett WS. (1998) Persistent respiratory effects in survivors of the Bhopal disaster. Thorax 53:S43-6. When inhaled the vapor produces a direct inflammatory effect on the respiratory tract. Pathophysiology Respiratory damage is related to the concentration of the gas and its solubility. Irritant gas exposures predominantly affect the airways, causing tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. Other inhaled agents may be directly toxic (e.g. cyanide, carbon monoxide), or cause harm simply by displacing oxygen and producing asphyxia (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide). The effect of inhaling irritant gases depends on the extent and duration of exposure and on the specific agentDemnati R, Fraser R, Ghezzo H, Martin JG, Plaa G, Malo JL. (1998) Time-course of functional and pathological changes after a single high acute inhalation of chlorine in rats, Eur Respir J. 11:922-8.Kirkhorn SR, Garry VF. (2008) Agricultural lung diseases. Environ Health Perspect 108:705-12.Hlastala MP, Ralph DD, Babb AL, Influence of gas physical properties on pulmonary gas exchange, Adv Exp Med Biol. 227 (1988) 33-8. Chlorine, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are among the most important irritant gases. Hydrogen sulfide is also a potent cellular toxin, blocking the cytochrome system and inhibiting cellular respiration. More water-soluble gases (e.g. chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride) dissolve in the upper airway and immediately cause mucous membrane irritation, which may alert people to the need to escape the exposure. Permanent damage to the upper respiratory tract, distal airways, and lung parenchyma occurs only if escape from the gas source is impeded. Less soluble gases (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, ozone) may not dissolve until they are well into the respiratory tract, often reaching the lower airways.Anderson JC, Hlastala MP. (2007) Breath tests and airway gas exchange. Pulm Pharmacol Ther. 20:112-7. These agents are less likely to produce early warning signs (phosgene in low concentrations has a pleasant odor), are more likely to cause severe bronchiolitis, and often have a lag of ≥ 12 h before symptoms of pulmonary edema develop. =Acute lung injury= Acute lung injury (ALI), also called non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, is characterized by the abrupt onset of significant hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of cardiac failure. The core pathology is disruption of the capillary-endothelial interface: this actually refers to two separate barriers – the endothelium and the basement membrane of the alveolus.Luh SP, Chiang CH. (2007) Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS): the mechanism, present strategies and future perspectives of therapies. J Zhejiang Univ Sci B 8:60-9.Flick MR. (1986) Mechanisms of acute lung injury. What have we learned from experimental animal models? Crit Care Clin. 2:455-70.Uchida T, Makita K. (2008) Acute lung injury and alveolar epithelial function. Masui. 57:51-9.Tang PS, Mura M, Seth R, Liu M. (2008) Acute lung injury and cell death: how many ways can cells die? Am J Physiol 294:L632-41. In the acute phase of ALI, there is increased permeability of this barrier and protein rich fluid leaks out of the capillaries. There are two types of alveolar epithelial cells – Type 1 pneumocytes represent 90% of the cell surface area, and are easily damaged. Type 2 pneumocytes are more resistant to damage, which is important as these cells produce surfactant, transport ions and proliferate and differentiate into Type 1 cells. The damage to the endothelium and the alveolar epithelium results in the creation of an open interface between the lung and the blood, facilitating the spread of micro-organisms from the lung systemically, stoking up a systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, the injury to epithelial cells handicaps the lung’s ability to pump fluid out of airspaces. Fluid filled airspaces, loss of surfactant, microvascular thrombosis and disorganized repair (which leads to fibrosis) reduces resting lung volumes (decreased compliance), increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right to left shunt and the work of breathing. In addition, lymphatic drainage of lung units appears to be curtailed—stunned by the acute injury—which contributes to the build-up of extravascular fluid. Some patients rapidly recover from ALI and have no permanent sequelae. Prolonged inflammation and destruction of pneumocytes leads to fibroblastic proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, tracheal remodeling and lung fibrosis. This fibrosing alveolitis may become apparent as early as five days after the initial injury. Subsequent recovery may be characterized by reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to further lung injuries. Extensive microvascular thrombosis may lead to pulmonary hypertension, myocardial dysfunction and systemic hypotension. =Acute respiratory distress syndrome= Clinically, the most serious and immediate complication is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which usually occurs within 24 h.Lynch JE, Cheek JM, Chan EY, Zwischenberger JB. (2006) Adjuncts to mechanical ventilation in ARDS. Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 18:20-7.Meduri GU, Yates CR. (2004) Systemic inflammation-associated glucocorticoid resistance and outcome of ARDS.

Those with significant lower airway involvement may develop bacterial infection. Importantly, victims suffering body surface burn and smoke inhalation are the most susceptible. Thermal injury combined with inhalation injury compromises pulmonary function, producing microvascular hyperpermeability that leads to a significant increase in lung lymph flow and pulmonary edema. The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 left many people with impaired lung function.Banauch GI, Izbicki G, Christodoulou V, Weiden MD, Webber MP, Cohen H, Gustave J, Chavko R, Aldrich TK, Kelly KJ, Prezant DJ.

(2010) Quality of life in relation to upper and lower respiratory conditions among retired 9/11-exposed firefighters with pulmonary disability. Qual Life Res. 19:1467-76. Prior to 9/11, 3% of firefighters had below-normal lung function, one year after 9/11 nearly 19% did, and six years later it stabilized at 13%. Ten to 14 days after acute exposure to some agents (e.g. ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury), some patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans progressing to ARDS. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia can ensue when granulation tissue accumulates in the terminal airways and alveolar ducts during the body's reparative process. A minority of these patients develop late pulmonary fibrosis. Also at enhanced risk are persons with co-morbidities. Several studies report that both aged persons and smokers are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of inhalation injury. Treatment strategies Specific pretreatments, drugs to prevent chemically induced lung injuries due to respiratory airway toxins, are not available. Analgesic medications, oxygen, humidification, and ventilator support currently constitute standard therapy. In fact, mechanical ventilation remains the therapeutic mainstay for acute inhalation injury.Matthay MA, Zemans RL. (2011) The acute respiratory distress syndrome: pathogenesis and treatment. Annu Rev Pathol. 6:147-63. The cornerstone of treatment is to keep the PaO2 > 60 mmHg (8.0 kPa), without causing injury to the lungs with excessive O2 or volutrauma. Pressure control ventilation is more versatile than volume control, although breaths should be volume limited, to prevent stretch injury to the alveoli. Positive end- expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to improve oxygenation. Hemorrhaging, signifying substantial damage to the lining of the airways and lungs, can occur with exposure to highly corrosive chemicals and may require additional medical interventions. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered, and bronchodilators to treat bronchospasms. Drugs that reduce the inflammatory response, promote healing of tissues, and prevent the onset of pulmonary edema or secondary inflammation may be used following severe injury to prevent chronic scarring and airway narrowing.Johnson ER, Matthay MA. (2010) Acute lung injury: epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment, J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv. 23:243-52. Although current treatments can be administered in a controlled hospital setting, many hospitals are ill-suited for a situation involving mass casualties among civilians. Inexpensive positive-pressure devices that can be used easily in a mass casualty situation, and drugs to prevent inflammation and pulmonary edema are needed. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other indications hold promise for treating chemically induced pulmonary edema. These include β2-agonists, dopamine, insulin, allopurinol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is particularly appealing because it has an established safety record and can be easily administered as an initial intervention. Inhaled and systemic forms of β2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma and other commonly used medications, such as insulin, dopamine, and allopurinol have also been effective in reducing pulmonary edema in animal models but require further study. A recent study documented in the AANA Journal discussed the use of volatile anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane, to be used as a bronchodilator that lowered peak airway pressures and improved oxygenation. Other promising drugs in earlier stages of development act at various steps in the complex molecular pathways underlying pulmonary edema. Some of these potential drugs target the inflammatory response or the specific site(s) of injury. Others modulate the activity of ion channels that control fluid transport across lung membranes or target surfactant, a substance that lines the air sacs in the lungs and prevents them from collapsing. Mechanistic information based on toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology may be instrumental in determining new targets for therapy. Mechanistic studies may also aid in the development of new diagnostic approaches. Some chemicals generate metabolic byproducts that could be used for diagnosis, but detection of these byproducts may not be possible until many hours after initial exposure. Additional research must be directed at developing sensitive and specific tests to identify individuals quickly after they have been exposed to varying levels of chemicals toxic to the respiratory tract. Currently there are no clinically approved agents that can reduce pulmonary and airway cell dropout and avert the transition to pulmonary and /or airway fibrosis. Preclinical development of pulmonary protective strategies Given the constant threat of bioterrorist related events, there is an urgent need to develop pulmonary protective and reparative agents that can be used by first responders in a mass casualty setting. Use in such a setting would require administration via a convenient route for e.g. intramuscular via epipens. Other feasible routes of administration could be inhalation and perhaps to a lesser extent oral – swallowing can be difficult in many forms of injury especially if accompanied by secretions or if victim is nauseous. A number of in vitro and in vivo models lend themselves to preclinical evaluation of novel pulmonary therapies. =In vitro= In vitro, exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells or human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells to agents such as hydrogen peroxide or bleach produces a time and toxin-dose-dependent decrease in cellular viability.Rappeneau S, Baeza-Squiban A, Jeulin C, Marano F.

Cells exposed to these agents demonstrate significant ATP depletion, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation, followed by death allowing for evaluation of novel cytoprotective agents. Potential tissue reparative agents can be evaluated in vitro by determining their effects on stimulation of pulmonary and airway epithelial cell proliferation. =In vivo= Test articles passing muster in vitro can be evaluated in a number of in vivo models (usually in mice) of ALI including chlorine inhalation, intratracheal instillation of bleomycin and in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) overexpressing transgenic mice exposed to high dose doxycycline.Matute-Bello G, Frevert CW, Martin TR.

Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia.Zarogiannis SG, Jurkuvenaite A, Fernandez S, Doran SF, Yadav AK, Squadrito GL, Postlethwait EM, Bowen L, Matalon S. (2011) Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 45:386-92 Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death.Li X, Li S, Zhang M, Li X, Zhang X, Zhang W, Li C.

(2009) Beneficial effect of a hydrogen sulphide donor (sodium sulphide) in an ovine model of burn- and smoke-induced acute lung injury. Br J Pharmacol. 158:1442-53. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.

An integral quadratic form is a quadratic form on Zn, or equivalently a free Z-module of finite rank. Two such forms are in the same genus if they are equivalent over the local rings Zp for each prime p and also equivalent over R. Equivalent forms are in the same genus, but the converse does not hold. For example, x2 \\\\+ 82y2 and 2x2 \\\\+ 41y2 are in the same genus but not equivalent over Z. Forms in the same genus have equal discriminant and hence there are only finitely many equivalence classes in a genus. The Smith–Minkowski–Siegel mass formula gives the weight or mass of the quadratic forms in a genus, the count of equivalence classes weighted by the reciprocals of the orders of their automorphism groups. Binary quadratic forms For binary quadratic forms there is a group structure on the set C equivalence classes of forms with given discriminant. The genera are defined by the generic characters. The principal genus, the genus containing the principal form, is precisely the subgroup C2 and the genera are the cosets of C2: so in this case all genera contain the same number of classes of forms.

Hieronymus Roth (1606–1678) was a lawyer and alderman of Königsberg (Polish: Królewiec, modern day Kaliningrad) who led the city burghers in opposition to Elector Frederick William. In the Treaty of Oliva of 1660 the Elector had managed to have himself recognized as sovereign in Ducal Prussia and no longer a vassal of the King of Poland. The Prussian Estates and Roth saw this as a step towards tyranny: before, when a conflict between the Estates and the Elector arose, the Estates always had a recourse to a higher authority, the King of Poland, but now this check had been removed. In 1661 the Prussian council, led by Roth, repudiated the Treaty of Oliva, stating that the transfer of sovereignty from Poland to the Elector was not valid without their consent. Roth then sent a plea to the King of Poland John II Casimir Vasa, asking for assistance. Furthermore, Roth and the burghers objected to Frederick's requirement that henceforth the Prussian Estates could meet only with his approval, and to the higher taxes the Elector had levied without their consent. As a result, Königsberg and her council refused to make an oath of allegiance to the Elector, and sent letters to the Polish king in Warsaw asking if they could \\"become Polish subjects once more, as (they) had been in the past\\". However, with no help for the burghers immediately forthcoming from the King of Poland, in October 1662 Frederick William arrived in Königsberg with two thousand soldiers and had Roth arrested, swearing that Roth would be \\"interrogated tomorrow, condemned the next and executed on Tuesday or Wednesday\\". While Roth was not immediately tried and killed, possibly because he would have been acquitted of any charge the Elector could bring against him, he was imprisoned in a fortress in Peitz, Brandenburg, far away from Ducal Prussia. Initially, the terms of Roth's imprisonment were relatively benign and the Elector stated that he would free him if Roth would admit to treason. However, Roth refused to ask for pardon and secretly continued agitation against the Elector via clandestine letters sent from his prison cell. When these were discovered, the conditions in the prison were made worse and Frederick swore never to release him. At the end of his life, at the age of seventy, Roth did submit himself to the Elector, remained imprisoned and died two years later. With the death of Count Christian Ludwig von Kalckstein in 1672, who had been kidnapped from Poland by Frederick William's agents and executed in Memel, and the end of resistance to the Elector in Königsberg in 1674, the opposition of the Prussian Estates to Hohenzollern absolutism in Ducal Prussia came to an end.

It was the last armed conflict of the Second Mexican Empire and the fall of the city resulted in the transition of the Empire into the Republic led by Benito Juárez. Circumstances Mexico City was occupied by the French Army. The French decided to withdraw the last of their corps on 5 February 1867 a week after the Emperor Maximilian also left Mexico City for Querétaro accompanied by his Imperial guards. On the 21st, Republican General Vicente Riva Palacio and Diego Álvarez Benítez arrived near the city with 4,000 soldiers. On the Imperialist side, General Leonardo Márquez marched to assume supreme command of the city. On his way to Mexico City Máquez was routed at San Lorenzo by Díaz. Márquez fled with his cavalry leaving the rest of the infantry behind. Colonel Kodolitsch saved the day by marching out and forming a rearguard to protect the retreating troops and bring them into the city. On 12 May all the foreign commanders agreed that they needed to prepare a secondary plan in case General Márquez' actions endangered their own men. They elected Colonel Khevenhüller as the acting Commander-in-Chief in case of the necessity to remove Márquez. They also agreed that in negotiating any ceasefire agreement they would act together to reach their own independent terms regardless of the Mexicans'. The capital was defended by 400 cannons. On the 2nd Republican forces seized the railroad line of Apisaco and started to transport the war material from Puebla by train. On the 15th General Porfirio Díaz arrived at Villa Guadalupe, where he tried to surround Villa Guadalupe, but was prevented by the Imperial artillery. The French counterguerillas who defended the village withdrew to the fortified garitas at San Lázaro, Vallejo and in the Peralvillo. These positions were already entrenched and defended by five hundred Austrians and two hundred Mexicans. The Austrian column was commanded by von Hammerstein, who was shot in the trenches on 25 May 1867. The communication and supply lines of the capital were shut down on 18th with the arrival Díaz' 12,000 soldiers. The Republicans were in a hurry to force the city to surrender as the rainy weather of autumn would prevent any further military action to be taken. Upon his arrival Díaz proclaimed that his intents were to arrest General Márquez, Tomás O'Horán and the former Minister of State. He also stated that he would execute all the Austrian auxiliaries if they were captured. The lives of the Francofon soldiers would be spared since 60% of his own cavalry consisted of French deserters. On 20 April Agnes Salm- Salm, a Prussian princess in Imperial service, appeared at the camp of Díaz and offered the disbandment of the European troops in exchange for the guarantee of their and Maximilian's lives and free passage back to Europe. Although her offer was not accepted she tried to further convince Díaz by sending word that the Austro-Hungarian troops were put on hold and under the temporary protection of the neutral Prussian flag as of 26th inst. Siege On 17 May Querétaro fell and Maximilian was taken prisoner and the 15,000 troops of General Mariano Escobedo were redirected to assist in the siege of the capital. On 23 May, Porfirio Díaz tightened the ring around the city and advanced to Tacubaya and was confronted by the French guerrillas at Belen on 30 May who held them back until 9 June when they were called to reassemble at San Antonio Abad. Meanwhile, the famine within the city became unbearable. It was reported that half of the population of 220,000 had fled from the city during the siege. There was an instance when 14,000 inhabitants left in one day. The famine was so severe it caused a minor rebellion within the local residents. On 8 June, rumors had it that a great quantity of grain was hidden in the Theatre Iturbide. The mob broke its entrances and flooded the building. Some amount of cereals was found which was immediately plundered. The riot escalated and reached the marketplace, threatening to pillage it. In fear that this would have led to greater conflict between the garrison and the civilians and to prevent the gates being opened and city delivered to the Republicans, the Austro-Hungarian cavalry raided the crowd and dispersed it. No weapons were used in order to avoid panic and an anti-Imperialist morale to arise. To prevent further riots, all hidden food stores were revealed by house-to-house searches and distributed by the hussars and gendarmes among the people. garita leading to the city On 14 June, General of artillery Ramirez Arellano arrived to the region and after having himself disguised as a charcoal-burner, infiltrated into the city and gave reports about the current situation of the Empire. Márquez took the opportunity to spread rumors of an Imperial victory in Querétaro and used the arrival of Arellano as a forged evidence for that. As soon as the rumors spread that the Emperor was victorious in Querétaro and he was on his way to relieve the capital, a great feast was held in the city. Díaz saw the fiesta as an opportunity to break the stalemate while the city was distracted with their celebration. At noon, he unexpectedly attacked San Cosme and Belen, sneaking with his soldiers one by one through an aqueduct. The native Indians and the French took up the arms against the surprise attack. They charged two cannons with grapeshots and targeted both sides of the aqueduct, while six men mounted it to cut the only possible escape route. The Liberals tried to take initiative three times, all of which were repulsed and they retreated. At the end of the assault attempt several hundred Liberals were found dead in the field. On the 18th the French and Austrian commanders met where the latter informed the guerillas that the Emperor was taken prisoner and that they proclaimed their neutrality for the rest of the battle and were already in negotiations with the Republicans. The French Commander Chenet referred to their previous agreement, in which they agreed that they wouldn't surrender without the consent of the other. The next day all Europeans put down their weapons and awaited until the end of the siege. The French were residing at San Pedro y San Pablo, while the other Europeans occupied the National Palace. As the funds were running low General Márquez engrossed $150,000 from the Barron, Forbes & Co. and impounded $60,000 more on the Nacional Monte de Piedad. No supplies could reach the city after it had been surrounded and as a result food stores ran empty and the forced levies just worsened the situation. Only three bakeries were still open to furnish the soldiers and the remaining two hundred thousand inhabitants. House raids were everyday common for hidden foodstocks. Still hundreds of people died of the famine. Every sort of commerce was completely suspended. =Breakout attempts= First The first breakout attempt took place on 18 May. The Imperial Mexican infantry was dispersed easily. A dismounted cavalry company intervened and assaulted the Republican ramparts, only to open the road for Colonel Kodolitsch to search for provisions in the nearby territory. After gathering enough rural goods, the Imperialists returned to the city. Second The second breakout commenced on Sunday at 2 o'clock in the morning of 9 June after preparing a plan to occupy the Santa Fé fort in order to secure the route into the city. Márquez still believed that the Emperor will arrive to the city with the rest of the army. At 4 am the \\"red Hussars\\" of Khevenhüller unified with the French counterguerillas at San Antonio Abad. At 5 am joined by regiment of gendarmes and the brigade of Quiroga they attacked the Republicans. The French were left in reserve. At 6 am General Tabera ordered a feint attack towards the Piedad river. The operation succeeded in piercing the enemy lines though all of his troops had to return to the city. Third The third and last breakout was led by Márquez himself, which was an undercover attempt to escape the capital and leave it to its fate as he received worrisome information regarding the fall of Querétaro and the capture of Maximilian. On the night of 17 June at the head of 6,000 men they marched through the Cuartos bridge in the direction of La Piedad. He was stopped by Díaz in person there who came from Tacubaya when he heard the cannon fire. At that time Colonel Leyva's battalion was nearly destroyed and Cuartos bridge had been almost taken when Díaz took command of the first battalion of Oaxaca lancers from General Terán, and reinforced the remnants of the Republicans. He was shortly followed by Terán's second and third Lancer battalion, General Naranjo and his Los Morales cavalry and Félix Díaz from Coyoacán. The Imperialists had no other way back but to pass the same bridge they came, which was covered by the fire of Díaz' artillery causing great losses to Márquez' forces =Negotiations= Díaz and O'Horán On the 18th The Mexican Imperial General O'Horán, persuaded Díaz to meet him halfway at night and used red light signals to identify himself while sneaking out undiscovered from the capital. Díaz escorted by drummers and buglers responded with the same signal, that unfortunately revealed his position to the Imperialist shooters who instantly opened fire on him. O'Horán blamed Márquez for the incident and swore his innocence. The second night O'Horan came out of the capital and met Díaz, which they did this time. He offered to surrender the city, including Márquez and the other principal officers, with the sole condition of obtaining a passport to go abroad. Díaz felt that such an offer is pointless considering the city was helpless, and that as for the other leaders I would fulfill my duty. O'Horán insisted that however the city would fall the capture of the wanted officers was uncertain, but his offer guaranteed both. Díaz refused again and warned the General that although he let him get away that time he would put him under custody as soon as the city was to be captured. Díaz and Khevenhüller News circulated within the capital that Querétaro had fallen. Upon his capture Maximilian wrote to Anton von Magnus, the Prussian minister to Mexico residing in Mexico City, and called for him to go to his prison and provide legal counseling before his trial. The Austrian commanders was suspicious and thought of that letter as a falsified one and wasn't conveyed by the telegraph. Avoiding a possible trick they asked the Prussian Baronto to find out the truth behind the courrier by indirectly requesting the Emperor to send a hand-written signed letter to clarify his will on the continuation of military matters. After local merchants confirmed the arrest of the Emperor, Colonel Kodolitsch declared and insisted that the foreign troops would continue to defend the city no matter what. On the 17th, Baron Eduard Lago, the Austrian chargé d'affaires, who had been released Querétaro on 2 June and returned to Tacubaya on the 16th, sent a mail on the same day to Colonel Khevenhüller, in which he assured to obtain a signed letter from the Emperor that ordered all officers of Austrian nationality to abstain from any further bloodshed. The Austrians were then convinced of its reliability and decided to cease hostilities immediately and asked Lago for mediation at Díaz. They insisted though to all their military honours, their neutrality, and protection, required to be escorted on the retreat of their troops to Vera Cruz, and assurance of their maintenance until their embarquement at the said port. All terms had been settled in an agreement, which was as follows: Although the agreement had never been ratified it came into effect on the day of the general surrender, they presented themselves disarmed at the National Palace at the time of the Republican takeover. Díaz and Tabera On 17 June General Ramon Tabera Commanding-General of the Second Army Corps began to make contact with Díaz, though returned without accomplishing anything. He assumed high command when Márquez disappeared from the city on the evening of 19 June with the rest of the treasury. A theory suggested he was smuggled alive by foreign Republican volunteers in a coffin to one of the cemeteries and set to travel at midnight. He was dressed as a fruit peddler to reach safely Vera Cruz. Other account claims he went to one of his confidant, a miller with his compatriot O'Horán. Otterbourg, the United States Consul General tried to deliver a truce proposition that the city would surrender in exchange for the prohibition of death sentences upon the garrison. Díaz refused to listen to the proposition, and allowed a few minutes for him to return. After he passed the Equestrian statue of Charles IV the shelling resumed. After realising the absence of Márquez white flags were raised on the city buildings, and the call for a capitulation was signaled to the besiegers. The official message was delivered to Díaz by Miguel Peña, Díaz de la Vega and Carlos Palafox on the behalf and consent of Tabera. The agreement was as follows: Díaz and Csizmadia Austrian ship SMS Novara comes for the discharged officers After the siege General Díaz was informed that Hungarian troops are present in the city. At the moment the Hungarian cavalry found shelter in the National Palace, when Díaz personally sent for Major Csizmadia and granted him a meeting. The two had known each other for quite a long time as Csizmadia served as a prison lieutenant in Puebla when Díaz was held as captive there. On one occasion Díaz refused to be taken to the bathroom by a low-rank prison guard when Csizmadia offered to personally escort him there, which was an unusual courtesy. He even invited the General for a lunch at his house, who accepted it. The lieutenant dealt with his inmate amicably and they even attended a bullfight together. Díaz only refused a closer friendship to evolve because he feared to having been labeled pro-Imperialist, and that would have ruined his image. On 20 September 1865 he successfully escaped from the prison using a rope and a dagger with the acquiescence and consent of the Hungarian officer. He praised Csizmadia's generous and noble attitude towards him several times in his later memoirs. This was the reason he was looking for the captured Csizmadia after the siege and allowed him and his Hungarian regiment to move to Vera Cruz and to be taken home on the board of the Austrian ship SMS Novara along with the rest of the Austrian corps. Csizmadia also helped to negotiate the same terms of surrender for the Austrians as well. =Final days= Feeling that the end is near Leonardo Márquez escaped from the capital, went into exile and passed the leadership to Ramon Tabera On 20 June, who immediately negotiated a surrender, which Díaz accepted and entered the city the following day. After taking measures for the maintaining the order and supplying food to the inhabitants Díaz sent out for the Imperialist officers, as well as ministers, councilors, administrators of the previous regime to present themselves voluntarily within a twenty -our-hour period. The only ones who did so were General Tabera and a few others. Díaz had three prisons prepared for the high class subordinates of the Empire each reserved to different branches of the same rank. Unprovoked punishment of the prisoners was prohibited. Their families and friends could freely visit them. The sick were permitted to remain at their homes. Many of them failed to show up and search-groups were formed to enforce the warrants. Among these were Vidaurri, Lacunza, O'Horan, and Manuel Ramirez Arellano but many of them were later arrested. Juan José Baz, newly appointed Chief of the Police of the Capital of the Mexican Republic proclaimed on 21 June: Finally President Juárez ceremonially visited the city on 21 July and issued a general amnesty. Army was reduced to 18,000 conscripts. See also * List of battles of the French intervention in Mexico Notes * Accounts differ who ordered the execution by firing squad of Tomás O'Horán. Charles d' Héricault claims it was Benito Juárez's wish. In his letter to the legation of the United States Marcus Otterbourg also confirmed the post-siege Republican trial of O'Horán and the execution as its verdict. James Creelman also links his execution to Juarez. While contemporary The New York Times reported that he was put to trial by Márquez and executed for treason.

Kindermann was born in Zittau, the son of a Schwertfeger, a smith who specialized in weapons. He attended the Gymnasium of his home town and was encouraged by Elias Weise. In 1654 he enrolled at the University of Wittenberg to study theology, but he also studied poetry and rhetoric with August Buchner. In 1657 he earned his master's degree in theology. One year later he was crowned as poeta laureatus by Johann Rist; he was made a member of Rist's ', the \\"Order of Swans of the Elbe\\", an association interested in language, in 1660. In 1659 Kindermann became vice principal of the Saldernsche Schule in Brandenburg an der Havel, and was appointed rector in 1664. In 1660 he married Dorothea Schiffner, the daughter of a Swedish captain, with whom he had four sons and two daughters. In 1667 he went to Magdeburg as a deacon at the Johanniskirche. From 1672 he served as first minister of the Ulrichskirche. He succeeded Christian Scriver in 1690 and became head of the school (Scholarch) later. He died in Magdeburg in 1706. Kindermann's work is extremely versatile: it includes satirical \\"poems\\" in the style of Johann Michael Moscherosch, poetic and rhetorical writings, poetry collections, as well as several plays. He wrote Lobgesang des Zerbster Biers (Song of praise of the Zerbst beer) in 1658.

In a racing career lasting from June 1960 until June 1961, the unfashionably-bred filly ran eight times and won six races. As a two-year-old she was beaten in her first two races, but her five-lengths win in the Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse was enough to see her rated among the best juveniles of the year. Sweet Solera was unbeaten in four races including the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket and Oaks at Epsom. She was then retired to stud, and had some success as a broodmare. Background Sweet Solera was a \\"big, handsome\\" chestnut filly with a broad white blaze and a long white sock on her left hind leg, bred in Ireland by Mrs D. M Walker. Her sire, Solonaway won the Irish 2,000 Guineas over a mile, but was better known as a sprinter. In the year of Sweet Solera's birth he was exported to Japan, where he became Champion sire in 1966. Her dam, Miss Gammon, won three minor races and was a half-sister of Royal Rasher, who won the Del Mar Oaks in 1957. She was a member of Thoroughbred Family 11-f which also produced Colombo, Aunt Edith and Meadow Court. An unusual feature of Sweet Solera's pedigree was the presence in the fourth generation of Call Boy: the 1927 Epsom Derby winner was almost sterile and sired very few foals. Sweet Solera's pedigree was not considered an impressive one and when she was sent as a yearling to the October sales at Newmarket she was bought for 1,850 guineas by the trainer Reg Day, acting on behalf of Mrs S. M. Castello. Day, who began training racehorses as a teenager in 1900, prepared the filly for racing at his Terrace House stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career Sweet Solera's two-year-old season lasted less than two months. She began her racing career at Kempton Park in June 1960 when she finished second in the Rivermead Stakes. Later that month she was moved up in class to contest the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot and finished third behind Cynara. In July Sweet Solera recorded her first success when she won the Princess Stakes at Newmarket, beating Ambergris by three lengths. The runner-up subsequently boosted the form when she defeated colts in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster. In the Cherry Hinton Stakes at the same course she was an impressive winner, beating Palatina by five lengths. Sweet Solera was being prepared for a run in the Cheveley Park Stakes in October when she contracted a respiratory infection which brought an end to her season. At the end of the year she was given a weight of 128 pounds, the fifth highest in the Free Handicap, a rating of the season's best two-year-olds. The top weight of 133 pounds was given to the French-trained filly Opaline, who had won the Cheveley Park Stakes in Sweet Solera's absence. On her three-year- old debut, Sweet Solera won the 1000 Guineas Trial Stakes at Kempton Park on 3 April, beating Who Can Tell, who subsequently won the Fred Darling Stakes. Twelve days later, she was then tried against colts for the first and only time in the Thirsk Classic Trial over one mile at Thirsk Racecourse. She won by three-quarters of a length from the colt Henry The Seventh, but appeared fortunate not to be disqualified, having hampered the runner-up in the closing stages. Henry the Seventh went on to win several major races including the Eclipse Stakes. In the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket, Sweet Solera was ridden by Bill Rickaby and started the 4/1 joint favourite with Mystify in a field of fourteen fillies. She won by one and a half lengths from Ambergris with a gap of six lengths back to Indian Melody in third. The time of 1:38.14 was over a second faster than that recorded by the colt Rockavon in the previous day's 2000 Guineas. Despite doubts about her stamina over the one and a half mile distance, Sweet Solera started 11/4 favourite for the Oaks at Epsom a month later. The race saw a duplication of the Newmarket form, with Sweet Solera beating Ambergris by one and a half lengths. Sweet Solera never raced again. Retirement The best of Sweet Solera's offspring was Bon Appetit, a filly sired by Major Portion, who won the Prix Vanteaux in 1970. Bon Appetit's daughter Batave, a Group-placed sprinter, produced the colt Bigstone, whose wins included the Sussex Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Sweet Solera died in 1978. Assessment and honours Sweet Solera was given a Timeform rating of 129 in 1960 and 127 in 1961, when she was the highest rated three-year-old filly in Europe. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sweet Solera an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks. The Group Three Sweet Solera Stakes for two-year-old fillies is run at Newmarket in August.

Dr. Howard Polsky, of Columbia University, has called Schwartz's earlier book, The Art of Intimacy, the Pleasure of Passion (1998), the most important book “to be read about the journey to happiness,” while Dr. Peter Breggin has labeled Mel \\"a brilliant philosopher of science and psychology,\\" who \\"brings Emergent Thinking to everything, from how we envision the physical universe to how we can improve our lives and our marriages.\\"\\"The Dr. Peter Breggin Hour – A Shift of Mind Read\\" http://prn.fm/2013/05/22/the-dr-peter-breggin-hour-a- shift-of-mind-052213/#axzz2X9GunSRS Schwartz has gained recognition for his methodology toward a mastery of thinking, in which he helps individuals free themselves from the habitual beliefs and thoughts that have constrained their lives. This approach enables people to overcome anxiety and depression without medication.Tiger 21 - Presenter Mel Schwartz, Founder, Emergent Thinking https://tiger21.com/presenter-bio/1312 Mel is a member of the Society for Consciousness Studies and has spoken at Yale University, among other venues, on his methods. Dr. David Loy, an expert on Japanese Zen Buddhism, has praised Mel for his contributions to the field of contemporary psychotherapy and non- duality.\\"The Nonduality of Good and Evil: Buddhist Reflections on the New Holy War\\" Schwartz has established an approach to fostering resilient relationships based upon themes he postulated in his books and many articles that view relationships through the filter of quantum inseparability. He has written over 100 articles read by over 1.5 million people. Schwartz trains and supervises therapists in his methodology, Trans-Cognitive Therapy, most recently at the 2017 annual CTAMFT Conference. Schwartz has proposed that the mental health community reconsider the nature of DSM diagnosis. He maintains that we should not conflate a diagnosis as being a literal “real” thing but merely as a description of what we think we see. He notes that our tendency to think in this manner is akin to reification. His article Diagnosis Disorder articulates this thesis. Schwartz suggests that much of the epidemic rate of mental health diagnoses, particularly anxiety and depression, are suggestive of living from an incoherent worldview.

The uprising was started by the local population as a response to persecutions of Serbs by the Ustaše and was led by Chetniks and Yugoslav Partisans. It soon spread across Lika and Bosanska Krajina. During the uprising numerous war crimes were committed against local Croat and Muslim population, especially in the area of Kulen Vakuf. As NDH forces lacked the strength to suppress the uprising, the Italian Army, which was not a target of the rebels, expanded its zone of influence to Lika and parts of Bosanska Krajina. Until 1990, 27 July was a national holiday in the Socialist Republic of Croatia called \\"Uprising Day of the People of Croatia\\". After the independence of Croatia, 22 June was chosen as the Anti-Fascist Struggle Day and a national holiday. Background On 6 April 1941, the German Reich invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During the Invasion of Yugoslavia, Ustaše, a Croat fascist and ultranationalist organization aboard, proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) on 10 April 1941, supported by Germany and Italy. By May 1941, the Ustaše formed the Jadovno concentration camp in Lika where they incarcerated and executed thousands of ethnic Serbs and other prisoners, which led to the rebellion. The Serbs were the majority in the Croatian Partisans until September 1943, and were absolute majority in the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, better known as Chetniks. Large scale persecutions in the area started in June 1941, including ethnic cleansing of around 1,200 Serbs who were expelled to occupied Serbia by Vjekoslav \\"Maks\\" Luburić, whereas in the municipality of Srb, days ahead of the rebellion, Luburić's Ustaše forces murdered 279 Serb civilians in the villages of Suvaja, Osredak and Bubanj. Prelude In June 1941, the Serbs started an uprising in eastern Herzegovina. The uprising was suppressed in early July, but peace was not established. NDH systematically persecuted the Serbian and Jewish populations throughout the country. The Communists entered into open conflict with the regime after Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June. However, they were not prepared for the July uprising nor did they order it. The rebellion was triggered by three individual rebels. On 26 July, a Home Guard officer was killed while driving from Drvar to Bosanski Petrovac. The NDH authorities then began arresting local peasants. Thus the local KPJ Committee was dragged into launching a full-scale rebellion. Rebellion An uprising in Croatia and western Bosnia started on 27 July 1941 with Drvar uprising in the area of Drvar and Bosansko Grahovo in Bosnian Krajina. The uprising was nominally under the command of the local Communists. However, the Communists were few in numbers and a large number of insurgents were influenced by the Chetniks and local pre-war politicians that spread anti- Croat propaganda and advocated for a Greater Serbia. The rebel groups attacked NDH institutions and ambushed Ustaše and Home Guard forces sent as reinforcements. Although they were ideologically on different sides, the Chetniks and the Communists formed an alliance in order to balance against the increasing power of the Ustaše. On 27 July the Ustaše lost control of Drvar. In the village of Trubar near Drvar, a Roman Catholic priest, Waldemar Maximilian Nestor, and his parishioners were killed by the insurgents. The NDH forces encircled Drvar, but lacked the artillery to capture the town. Eight battalions and several batteries were sent from Zagreb to the Drvar area, where an estimated 4,000 armed insurgents were located. On 28 July, in the village of Brotnja in the municipality of Srb, 37 civilians were killed and their houses were looted and destroyed by Chetniks. From 29 July to 2 August, the town of Gračac was under siege. Gračac was defended by Ustaše and Home Guard forces, in total about 2,000 soldiers. Actions by the insurgents jeopardized Donji Lapac, which the Ustaše had to leave. The rebels entered the village on 30 July without a fight. The Italian Army in the area was not a target of attacks, the insurgents even asked them for protection against the Ustaše. According to an Italian assessment, the uprising was primarily directed against the Ustaše regime, while the influence of the Communists had a secondary role. On 2 August the rebels looted and burned the Croat village of Boričevac. The majority of the population, 2,180 people, fled to Kulen Vakuf, a large village near Drvar, before the insurgents entered. 55 remained in the village, mostly women and elderly, all of whom were killed. Kulen Vakuf, whose garrison was under the command of captain Vladimir Veber, was encircled by rebel forces. Stevo Rađenović was labeled by the Italians as the political leader of the Serb resistance movement in Lika. The rebellion spread to North Dalmatia near the town of Knin, which was directly endangered. The command of the city was completely taken by the Italians. Reports from the Ustaše recorded their dissatisfaction with the actions of the Italians, indicating the Italian authorities were giving refuge and support to the Chetniks. General Mihajlo Lukić of the 3rd Lika Brigade was given the task of suppressing the uprising in Lika and the destruction of the rebel units. On 17 August 2 battalions and a battery of cannons, numbering about 1,300 men, started an attack in order to relief Kulen Vakuf and connect with forces coming from Gračac. The operation ran according to plans and in the first two days NDH forces managed to capture significant territory. On 19 August NDH troops reached Gornji Lapac where they found no resistance. A vanguard of the Ustaše and Home Guard troops, sent towards Boričevac, was ambushed and the offensive was halted. The rebels then strengthened their blockade of Kulen Vakuf and villages along the left bank of the Una River. On 4 September they attacked and destroyed the village of Ćukovi. Although the local Muslims were not members of the Ustaše, the village was captured to completely encircle Kulen Vakuf. Veber tried to break through from Kulen Vakuf to Bihać to evacuate the population during the night on 5–6 September. He had a Home Guard and Ustaše battalion and Muslim militia at his disposal. As the convoy left Kulen Vakuf, the rebels quickly crossed the Una and seized control of the village. The rebels attacked the retreating column and killed around three hundred refugees. A percentage of the refugees managed to reach Bihać, but about a third were captured. 70 were immediately killed and 400, mainly women and children, were returned in captivity to Kulen Vakuf and held at the police and railway stations. Another 900, also mostly women and children, were held in a meadow, while about 380 male captives were transferred to another village. A percentage of the prisoners held at the meadow were butchered by the rebels and locals. About 50 tried to escape, but were captured and killed, their bodies thrown into a pit. Then, the Communists and rebels opposing the killings of the captives intervened. Kulen Vakuf was burned to the ground. The NDH lacked the forces to suppress the rebellion. The Germans could not divert their troops as all available forces were on the eastern front. The Italians, on the other hand, were able to provide assistance, but agreed to it only to strengthen their own influence over NDH. On 26 August 1941 the NDH government reached an agreement that the Italians re-occupy the 2nd and 3rd zones in order to pacify the insurgents in those areas. In late 1941 the Italians re- occupied several previously NDH-held towns in the Bosnian Krajina. In early October the Italian 5th Corps re-occupied Kulen Vakuf. Commemoration Monument to the Uprising of the people of Croatia in Srb In the Socialist Republic of Croatia, the Srb uprising was commemorated as a national holiday, the \\"General People's Uprising Day in Croatia\\" (Dan općeg narodnog ustanka u Hrvatskoj) on 27 July after the proposal was accepted in 1945 by the ZAVNOH. Later the name \\"Uprising Day of the People of Croatia\\" (Dan ustanka naroda Hrvatske) became more prevalent in public. In 1991, after the collapse of the Communist regime, the new Croatian government replaced the former Uprising Day with the Anti-Fascist Struggle Day on 22 June, the date when in 1941 the Sisak People's Liberation Partisan Detachment was formed – the first Partisan unit in Croatia. Nevertheless, several anti-fascist organizations and the Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS) continued to commemorate this date as the first day of an antifascist uprising. Right-wing organizations and parties such as the Autochthonous Croatian Party of Rights condemn the gathering, calling it a \\"historical forgery\\" and \\"celebration of genocide against Croats\\", and organize counter-protests against the commemoration year after year; the commemoration is secured by strong police forces. Former president Stjepan Mesić was at the 2012 commemoration and called members of the counter- protests the \\"quasi-patriots\\". The commemoration had been attended by members of the state leadership until about 2012, but they later withdrew amidst the controversy.

The film stars a large ensemble cast including Robert De Niro, Katherine Heigl, Diane Keaton, Amanda Seyfried, Topher Grace, Ben Barnes, Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams. It was released on April 26, 2013 by Lionsgate in the United States and Canada. Plot Don and Ellie Griffin were a New England couple married for twenty years before they divorced. They have three children from their marriage – Lyla, Jared, and adopted son Alejandro, who originates from Colombia. In preparation for Alejandro's wedding, Ellie arrives at Don's (and her old) home, and lets herself in. She interrupts Don just as he is about to perform oral sex on Bebe, his girlfriend of eight years (and Ellie's former best friend). All are embarrassed, but they make small talk, and he shows Ellie to her room. Meanwhile, Alejandro and his fiancée Missy are meeting with Father Moinighan, the priest who will be marrying them. It is revealed that Alejandro's biological mother Madonna is going to be coming from Colombia to the wedding, which upsets Alejandro since he does not have a \\"traditional\\" family, and his Catholic mother would not approve of that or the fact that Don and Ellie had been divorced. Lyla, who reveals she is separated, goes to the hospital and sees her 29-year-old brother Jared, an OB, after passing out. They talk and it is revealed that he is a virgin and is waiting for the \\"right one\\". Back at home, Alejandro tells Ellie about his mother coming to the wedding. Explaining that since she is a devout Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce, Alejandro asks Ellie and Don to pretend to be married for the next three days. Hearing this, Bebe becomes upset and leaves the house, clearly upset at Don. Alejandro's mother arrives with his biological 20-year-old sister, Nuria. Later, Nuria flirts with Jared, after she brazenly strips naked to skinnydip in the family's lake as he watches. That evening, the family goes out to dinner with Missy and her parents Muffin and Barry, and Bebe shows up as their waitress, which surprises everyone. Meanwhile, Nuria starts fondling Jared under the table, and Ellie sees Nuria giving Jared a handjob. She takes Nuria to the restroom for a chat, telling her that American women behave differently with men. When they arrive home, Jared tells Nuria he wants to have sex, as she had suggested earlier, but she tells him \\"No\\", asking him instead to do romantic things for her such as read her poetry. Don and Ellie, meanwhile, end up having sex after Ellie, still pretending to be Don's wife, sleeps in Don's room. Ellie and Madonna go for a walk in the woods and talk. Neither understands the other's language, though they think they are communicating on some level. At the same time, Don and Lyla talk privately and Lyla reveals she is pregnant. On the wedding day, before the ceremony, Don tells Bebe he had sex with Ellie. Bebe says she forgives them but then punches him in the face. She also reveals that Ellie cheated on Don with Missy's father before Don cheated on her. Muffin says that she knows about Ellie and Barry, and tells them that she is bisexual, implying that she is interested in a sexual affair with both Bebe and Ellie. Meanwhile, Missy and Alejandro have decided to get married on the family dock to escape the chaos. The family runs after them and, after some of them fall into the lake, the wedding reception is on. During the reception, Jared goes upstairs to talk to Nuria, who tells him she has decided to no longer follow Ellie's advice (about not being so available sexually), and they sleep together. Back at the reception, Ellie and Bebe have made up. Don surprises Bebe by proposing to her, and they get married on the spot. Lyla's husband Andrew arrives at the wedding and, upon finding out that Lyla is pregnant, reconciles with her. Alejandro's mother realizes she has been lied to about his family and he runs after her as she starts to leave. But she reveals that her own past was not as pure as he thought, that she too had lied to protect him, and she forgives him. Time passes and it is revealed that Lyla has had a daughter named Jane, as Don attaches a plaque with her name to their family tree.

The supporting cast features Marie Wilson, Ralph Bellamy, Frank McHugh, Dick Foran and Ronald Reagan. The screenplay by Bella and Sam Spewack is based on their 1935 stage play of the same name, which ran for 669 performances on Broadway.\\"Boy Meets Girl\\" on the Internet Broadway Database The two zany screenwriters played by Cagney and O'Brien were based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, while Ralph Bellamy's part as the producer was based on Darryl Zanuck of 20th Century Fox. Plot Two screenwriters, Law and Benson (James Cagney and Pat O'Brien), are in need of a story for cowboy star Larry Toms (Dick Foran). When studio waitress Susie Seabrook (Marie Wilson) faints in the office of producer C.F. Friday (Ralph Bellamy) because she is pregnant, the writers get an idea for a story about a cowboy and a baby, and cast Susie's unborn baby Happy in the part. The story will be the classic Hollywood tale: Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. When they all leave to sell the idea to their boss, Susie meets and is intrigued by, Rodney Bowman (Bruce Lester), a good-looking young Englishman who is an extra on one of the studio's films. Larry is tired of having a scene-stealing baby as a co-star, and his agent, Rossetti (Frank McHugh), devises a scheme to have Larry woo Susie in order to marry her and, as Happy's father, get him out of show business and into a normal life. When they hear about this, Benson and Law hire Rodney, unaware that Susie knows him, to pretend to be Susie's long-lost husband, Happy's father; Rodney thinks it's just an acting job, and is not in on the deception. Their plan works, and Larry disavows any planned future with Susie, but an wanted result is that Baby Happy is fired due to the scandal. When their plot is exposed, the two writers are fired, and Law makes plans to move to Vermont to suffer and write the Great American Novel, but Benson, whose wife has just left him, is too deep in debt to leave - so they come up with another plan. They have a friend in London send a wire to B.K. (Pierre Watkin), the head of the studio, with an offer from a British studio to buy it, as long as Baby Happy is under contract. Under the circumstances, Happy, Benson and Law are all re-hired. Just then, Rodney bursts into the office and asks Susie to marry him and come to England. Benson and Law try to persuade Susie that Rodney is a no-good cheat and philanderer only after her money, but the American representative of the British studio shows up to identify him as the son of an English lord. The rep also reveals that the plan to purchase the studio is a fraud. Producer C.F. wants to fire Benson and Law again, but their new contracts are iron- clad. Susie leaves with Rodney, heading for England, and C.F. learns that his wife is pregnant. Cast Production According to The Hollywood Reporter Marion Davies was originally considered to play Susie. The media has speculated on several reasons for the change in casting. One is that Davies' lover, William Randolph Hearst, rejected the film for Davies because he thought it was too racy for her. Another is that Hearst rejected the film because his Cosmopolitan Productions was severing relations with Warner Bros. Another possible reason is that Davies rejected the role herself, upset with cast changes for the film or with the size of her part. In any case, Davies did not do the picture, and never made another film. Boy Meets Girl was Cagney's eighth picture with comedy-specialist director Lloyd Bacon, out of the nine they would eventually make together; it was also Pat O'Brien's eighth out of an eventual ten with Bacon, and the fifth of nine to pair Cagney and O'Brien. Cagney, O'Brien, their Boy Meet Girl co-stars Ralph Bellamy and Frank McHugh, along with Spencer Tracy and Frank Morgan, called themselves \\"The Boys Club\\" and had dinner together on Thursday nights.Thames, Stephanie. \\"Boy Meets Girl (1938)\\" on TCM.com In the scene which takes place at a glitzy Hollywood movie premiere, with Ronald Reagan - newly signed to Warner Bros. - playing the radio announcer, the name of the film is given as The White Rajah, starring Errol Flynn. This was the name of a script actually written by Flynn, but rejected for production as being too weak. Supposedly, Flynn was not happy with the in-joke. Reception Reviewers at the time of release thought that the requirements of the Hays Office censors regarding Susies's pregnancy caused the satire of the original play to be less effective in the film.\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com Radio adaptation Boy Meets Girl was presented on Old Gold Comedy Theatre May 20, 1945.

Like the famous sultan, the FATİH project also aims to open a new era. The project Smartboard With the initiation of the FATİH project, classes will receive smart boards, students will receive tablet computers and classes will be enriched with the use of e-books. The project has been completely designed by Turkish engineers. All state schools spanning from preschools all the way to high school level will receive a total of 620,000 smart boards, while tablet computers will be distributed to 17 million students and approximately one million teachers and administrators. This project, which is being conducted by the Ministry of National Education and supported by the Ministry of Transportation is expected to be completed in 2015. Content The tablet computers which will be distributed to students, are loaded with e-books. In addition to books, tablets include class lessons, sounds, animations and graphics. Both teachers and students are restricted from entering all websites. Only websites that have been selected by educators and specialists and passed through the Ministry of National Education's filtering system and deemed harmless are granted access. Teachers are able to check on their own tablets whether or not a student is following the course. If a student is found straying from the lesson, teachers have the capability to lock a student's computer. Although \\"success (or failure) may depend .... on ... groups outside the formal education sector\\" login to the main content site was only available to state schools. Financing The pilot stage for the tablets was conducted with Samsung and General Mobile via the State Materials Office. For every 4,800 tablets purchased from Samsung, each one cost 775 TL.

The film was released by Warner Bros. on August 22, 1938. Plot Innocent young Connie Heath (Jane Bryan) is persuaded to borrow a party dress from her friend, \\"fast girl\\" Hilda Engstrom (Sheila Bromley), who has actually misappropriated it from the dry cleaner where she works. After the real owner of the dress, witchy Gloria Adams (Susan Hayward), spots Connie out in the dress (which is subsequently torn in a car door), Connie is falsely accused of theft and prosecuted as Hilda flees town and leaves her to take the blame. Though Gloria withdraws her charge, the insurance company continues to persecute poor Connie, resulting in a charge of grand larceny. Championing her cause is crusading attorney Neil Dillon (Ronald Reagan)- coincidentally, also Connie's date on the evening in question- who gets Connie off with probation. Connie leaves town after being mistreated by her unsympathetic father (Sig Ruman) and gets a job in order to pay for the damaged dress. One day she spots Hilda waiting in a parked car on the street and begins to argue with her in the car when Hilda's boyfriend emerges from a bank he has just robbed, fleeing the scene with Connie in tow. She is arrested and convicted while refusing to give her real name or full story for fear of humiliating her family. Eventually the truth begins to emerge, and Connie is given probation, returns home, and becomes engaged to Dillon. When Hilda is given probation, she returns to town as well, to make even more trouble for Connie, especially after her boyfriend escapes prison.

Established in the 4th century, the city rose to importance in the medieval period as a bishop's seat. In the 15th century it became an important center of Renaissance humanism and, in the 16th century, of the Protestant Reformation. Basel joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. In the 19th century, Basel was a center of Industrialisation, and it remains one of the major cities of contemporary Switzerland.

Emperors Constantius II and Julian assemble their armies at the Castrum Rauracense before marching to battle against the Alemanni. A church is built near Castrum Rauracense.

A legend holds that Roland lived in Vallespir and that, after his death at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass, his horse Veillantif carried Roland's corpse back to Vallespir and buried him under this dolmen. Dolmens are actually tombs, but they were erected many centuries before the legendary knight's adventures. The Caixa de Rotllan is made of three upright stones in a H-shape, supporting a thick roofing stone and delimiting a rectangular, medium-sized chamber. The entrance faces south- east, as do many other dolmens in Pyrénées-Orientales. The building has been listed as a Monument historique since 1889 but has never been excavated by archaeologists. Location View of the tumulus. The dolmen, on the middle- left part of the picture, is partially hidden by trees. The Caixa de Rotllan is one of 148 dolmens listed in the Pyrénées-Orientales department. Some have been destroyed or are attested by old sources but have been lost and not rediscovered by modern scholars. lists 147 dolmens. The dolmen de Castelló was discovered in 2011: see . They are all located in hilly or mountainous areas of the department, usually on a mountain pass, ridge or other high ground.. Like others, this dolmen is situated on a ridge line. It is on the southern side of the Canigou, at above sea level, just beneath a granitic chaos in the historical and geographical region named Vallespir. It stands on the border between French communes Arles-sur-Tech and Montbolo. Two ways lead to the dolmen from Arles town. A passable track along the Bonabosc river leads near it, but one must leave this track for a walk to the dolmen. The GR 10 footpath also runs near the dolmen. This part of the GR 10 is an old track leading to the Batère iron ore mines from Arles-sur-Tech. This route takes an hour and a half to walk.. The Caixa de Rotllan is indicated by a star on the 1:25000 Institut Géographique National map, indicating a ' (French for \\"curiosity\\")., Institut Géographique National Description Plan of the dolmen. Like most of the dolmens in the Pyrénées-Orientales, the Caixa de Rotllan has a simple plan — that is, without a corridor — which relates it to other dolmens from the chalcolithic and Bronze Age of the second half of the third millennium BC.

In Catalan, Caixa de Rotllan means \\"Roland's grave\\", suggesting that the inhabitants of the region had long known that the dolmen had been used as a grave. Many megaliths in the Pyrénées- Orientales are named after mythic characters such as Roland or his enemies the \\"Moors\\" (Catalan: ').. Other nearby places are named after Roland. north of the Caixa along the ridgeline lies the ' (\\"Roland's Puck\\"). It refers to an ancient game named Palet, in which players had to knock down a target (usually a stick) standing on the ground by throwing a puck (or Palet) at it. According to a legend, Roland played this game, but used huge stones intstead of pucks and enjoyed aiming at the castles of Vallespir as targets. Further to the north lies the ' (\\"the watering trough of Roland's horse\\") where the legendary knight's horse Veillantif used to drink. The ' (\\"Roland's cave\\") is another dolmen in Corsavy, a nearby commune where Roland used to rest. According to The Song of Roland, Roland and his friends Oliver and Turpin died at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass and their corpses were brought to and buried in the Basilica of St. Romain, in Blaye, by Charlemagne. Another legend tells that Veillantif brought the corpse of his master to the Vallespir near the place where he used to play palet. A tomb was built there: it is the Caixa de Rotllan. Many places in this region are named after the pawprints left by Veillantif.. History The Caixa de Rotllan may have been erected during the Chalcolithic or the beginning of the Bronze Age, during the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. During the Middle Ages it marked the boundary between Arles and Montbolo. The current boundary between these two communes runs very near the dolmen. « Dolmen sur l'ancienne route d'Arles à Batera (\\"Dolmen on the ancient road from Arles to Batera\\") in . The first paper that mentioned this dolmen was an article written by Jean-Baptiste Renard de Saint-Malo in 1837 and entitled Monument druidique (entre Arles et Batère) (\\"Druidic monument between Arles and Batère\\"). But Renard de Saint-Malo seems to have confused the Caixa with another stone, the nearby palet of Roland. Louis Companyo's Histoire naturelle du département des Pyrénées-Orientales (\\"Natural History of the Pyrénées-Orientales Département\\"), in 1861, corrected this mistake, noting that the palet is not a dolmen and warning its readers against the frequent confusion between some natural stones and dolmens... The first scientific description of the Caixa was made by Alexandre-Félix Ratheau in 1866, in «Note sur un monument celtique du département» (\\"Note On A Celtic Monument Of The Département\\") published in the Bulletin de la Société agricole, scientifique et littéraire des Pyrénées-Orientales. At this time, people thought that dolmens had been built by the Celts. In his paper, Ratheau, a French engineer and author of several books on fortications, recorded the dolmen's dimensions, its orientation relative to the north and a plan with three elevation cuts.See or the illustration below. Ratheau said that the palet was made of pieces of abandoned granite grindstones and clarified Companyo's correction. Indeed, reading Companyo's paper, people may have thought that no Caixa de Rotllan dolmen existed. In 1887, an engraving, made from a photograph, of the dolmen was published in La création de l'Homme et premiers âges, by Henri Raison du Cleuziou. In 1889, the ' was classified as a Monument historique. « Dolmen au pied du Canigou » (\\"Dolmen down the Canigou\\") in La création de l'Homme et premiers âges, 1887.

It was the first offensive during the war by the Swedish army, and it was directly led by Charles XII of Sweden commanding the right flank and Arvid Horn together with Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld at the left. The Swedes were victorious and utterly routed the Danish forces led by Jens Rostgaard.  Background  The Swedish king Charles XI had died in 1697. Sweden's competitors, Russia, Denmark-Norway and Saxony- Poland-Lithuania, tried to exploit this by forming a coalition in order to regain their earlier losses. Denmark wanted to reclaim territory lost in the Second Northern War, Russia to get a port to the Baltic Sea, and Saxony- Poland-Lithuania to take back Livonia. This, they supposed, could be easily achieved against the new and inexperienced Swedish king, Charles XII. However, this new threat Charles had to deal with was averted during the first years of the war due to surprising movements made by the Swedish king's troops, one of them being the landing on Humlebæk, an invasion of Denmark with the aim of capturing Copenhagen undertaken in reaction to the Danish attack on Holstein- Gottorp.  Prelude  About 16,000 Swedish troops were gathered in Scania to launch against Denmark and another 10,000 just by the Norwegian border. The Swedish fleet went out from Karlskrona to Øresund with their 38 ships of the line. The Danish fleet of 40 ships however blocked their pathway in the West entrance of Drogden and forced the Swedish ships to sail another way across to the East by the name of Flintrännan - which at the time was claimed to have been too shallow - but Charles XII gave order that they should try. At July 13 the Swedish ships went over Flintrännan with only 5 ships that ran aground and got stuck, which had to be pulled up. With the ran-across Flintrännan completed the Swedish ships met up with an English-Dutch combined fleet of 25Bain, Robert: Charles XII and the Collapse of the Swedish Empire, 1902, p.60. ships, commanded by George Rooke. With the Anglo-Dutch fleet laying just outside the island of Ven, the combined fleet pressured the Danish ships and forced them a retreat to Copenhagen where they were utterly under fire and pinned down. (The English and Dutch interest in the war was to keep the balance of the Northern trademarks on a level where the economy wouldn't suffer any bigger blows which in the end could effect outside nations as themselves. Therefore, they sent a combined fleet to help Sweden in the war with Denmark and to sue for peace in the northern affairs.) Instead of sending troops to help the occupied Holstein, Charles decided to land on Humlebæk which had been suggested by Carl Magnus Stuart and Hans Wachtmeister. With some minor stratagem, the Swedish fleet tricked the Danish forces on Zealand to believe a major landing would occur at Rungsted instead of Humlebæk.  The landing  the Landing on Humlebæk August 4, 1700 Out of 4,700 Swedish soldiers who sailed from Karlskrona, 2,500 would participate in the first wave against the Danish defenders at Humlebæk. The Swedish forces consisted of mostly infantry and were commanded by Charles XII, Arvid Horn and Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld. The Danish forces on Zealand consisted of 5,000 men of which 350 cavalry and 350 peasants were defending the entrenched beach, commander of these were Jens Rostgaard who also had 7 artillery pieces in his favor. There was a light fog and Swedish soldiers were put in small landing boats ready to storm the Danish entrenchment. Meanwhile, the allied fleet bombarded Copenhagen to pin down the Danish troops and ships to not disturb the operation. At August 4, 1700 six o'clock Sweden launched the attack, a cannon strike was heard as a signal and with supporting fire from nearby ships bombarding the Danish defences, the small landing boats closed in to Humlebæk. First into the water was a lieutenant named Gustaf Henrik Siegroth who jumped in with his men to secure the left flank of the beach, constantly under fire from both Danish muskets and cannons and water reaching up to their waist they kept moving, although slowly. The Danish cavalry saw its opportunity to strike and stop the advancing Swedes before reaching the beach, and sent out a squadron of horsemen. The Swedes however, succeeded in keeping their powder dry and with some accurate shots halted their charge, then when reaching shallower water they went in with their bayonets. This forced the Danish cavalry to retreat and the left flank was secured for a landing. The actions portrayed by Siegroth quickly encouraged the Swedish right flank under the lead of Charles XII who didn't hesitate to jump into the water. With the muskets above their heads the Swedish right reached the beach and forced the remaining Danish soldiers to rout, and the landing was secured. The Swedes built up field redoubts and camps the very next day for the 4,700 troops, their state was however critical, without having any cavalry on shore they were like rats stuck in a corner for any possible Danish assault.  Aftermath  The bombardment of Copenhagen, 1700 After the successful landing on Humlebæk the Danish defences started withdrawing to Copenhagen which had been under fire from the allied fleet. The fleet which had transported the Swedish soldiers were sent back to pick up reinforcements. After some days they arrived with Magnus Stenbock and the force at Humlebæk then reached 10,000 soldiers. The strategical plan was to lay siege to Copenhagen and force Denmark to surrender, a storm of the city was out of the question since the morale of the Danish forces seemed rather high. Instead it would get bombarded both from sea and land. However, on August 12, 1700 during his march to siege Copenhagen Charles were told that Denmark and Holstein had made peace. He ordered the march to continue until the peace treaty was clearly confirmed which it did get on the 23rd when Frederick IV Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, messaged the Swedish king that the peace really was established according to the terms of the Peace of Travendal, and that Denmark would not support the alliance against Sweden in the future. With one less opponent in the war Sweden aid to help the besieged Narva where they delivered a crushing defeat in the battle of Narva which forced Russia to retreat and end their campaign of 1700. = Casualties = The casualties suffered by both nations are unknown, however it's said Sweden only had one confirmed killed during the landing and about five to twenty wounded. Another source claim the Swedes to have suffered three killed, the possibility of this is that the two extra killed rather died from their wounds after the battle. The Danish casualties are a little bit trickier with no real confirmed casualties, it is however claimed that some ten to twenty men were killed and a group of peasants were captured, disarmed but later set free. Even though the landing was not of major scale, it inflicted a huge blow to Denmark who was forced to make peace.

He held the office of Chief Baron of the Exchequer 1362-5. He suffered temporary disgrace when he was removed from office for corruption, but he was restored to favour, became Lord Chief Justice of Ireland 1370-2, and later returned to the English bench. He appears to have been the only High Court judge to have escaped impeachment by the English Parliament of 1388. Family He was the younger son of William de Skipwith and Margaret Fitzsimon. The Skipwiths came from Skipwith in North Yorkshire : the family were descended from Robert de Stuteville, lord of the manor of Skipwith in the reign of Henry III;Kingsford, Charles Lethbridge \\"William de Skipwith\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 Vol. 52 p.356 the Fitzsimons were from Ormsby in Lincolnshire, where the de Skipwiths later settled. On the death of his elder brother, William inherited the family estates.Kingsford p.356 Early career He was probably educated at Gray's Inn. He became Sergeant-at-law in 1354 and was knighted and made a justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1359. He became Chief Baron in 1362, and trier of petitions in Parliament.Kingsford p.357 Disgrace and return In 1365 Skipwith and the Lord Chief Justice, Henry Green, were removed from office for having acted \\"contrary to law and justice\\", and having unlawfully obtained large sums of money. Green never held office again, but Skipwith was only in temporary disgrace. In 1370 he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland and received 40 marks to cover his expenses.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 86 In 1373 he is recorded sitting on a commission of gaol delivery in Dublin.Ball p.86 In 1376 he was restored to his old seat on the Court of Common Pleas in England, and remained in office until 1388. He regularly appeared in Parliament as a trier of petitions and sat on various judicial commissions. Merciless Parliament When Richard II summoned the High Court judges in August 1387 to give their opinion on the lawfulness of the actions of the powerful commission of nobles known as the Lords Appellant, Skipwith pleaded illness as an excuse for non- attendance.Kingsford p. 357 As a result, he avoided participating in the judgment against the Lords Appellant, condemning them for treason and authorising their arrest, which the judges later claimed they had been coerced into giving. His decision not to attend was a wise one, since when the judges were impeached by the Merciless Parliament in 1388, Skipwith escaped censure. He and his eldest son swore to uphold the Lords Appellant, but he retired from the Bench soon afterwards. He was still living in 1392. King Richard II, who presided in person over the Merciless Parliament Descendants He married Alice de Hiltoft of Ingoldmells, Lincolnshire. They had several daughters and two surviving sons, William, who died without issue, and John (died 1422), ancestor of the Skipwith Baronets of Metheringham.

He is the founder and honorary executive director of Distressed Children & Infants International, an international non-profit organization based in the United States that works with underprivileged children and their families to stop child labor, extend educational opportunities, and provide access to healthcare. Early life and education Hoque was born in Barisal, Bangladesh to A.N. Shamsul Hoque (a professor of political science and public administration at Duke University, Dhaka University and at Rajshahi University) and Hasina Begum, in 1964. He was born with congenital cataracts, and by the age of five had undergone seven eye surgeries, which partially restored his vision. At the time cataract surgery was uncommon in Bangladesh. Despite his family and physician advising him against prolonged studying and suggested he not attend school due to his impaired vision, he persevered in his studies and by 1987 he had graduated from Rajshahi Medical College to become a medical doctor. He completed his Ph.D. in 1995 at Asahikawa Medical College (Japan) and his postdoctoral fellowship in 1997 at the University of Western Ontario (Canada). Career Over the course of his career, Hoque has worked at numerous institutes around the world, including Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (Bangladesh), Dhaka Shishu Hospital (Bangladesh), Asahikawa Medical University (Japan), University of Western Ontario (Canada), University of Toronto (Canada), and Yale University School of Medicine (US). His research has focused on cardiovascular pharmacology and physiology, concentrating on ischemic reperfusion injury of the heart, and neuroendocrinology with a focus on aging. Hoque has published his work in various scientific journals and presented his findings at national and international conferences. He has also been the recipient of numerous academic honors, including a Monbusho Scholarship from the Japanese Ministry of Education, research awards from the Heart & Stroke Foundation of Ontario, the University of Toronto Research Fellowship, and the Hartford Foundation Fellowship. Hoque is now a dedicated activist for children's rights and serves as full-time Executive Director of the American non-profit organization Distressed Children & Infants International. He is also involved with eye research projects at Yale University with colleague Brian DeBroff and serves as Honorary Goodwill Ambassador and International Consultant for Thengamara Mohila Sabuj Sangha, one of the largest non-governmental organizations in Bangladesh. Hoque consistently advocates for those with disabilities and promotes inclusion efforts to normalize their lives. Additionally, he is an active member of the Rotary Club of Cambridge, MA, US. Major scientific achievements In 1995 Ehsan Hoque discovered that Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a toxic substance which accumulates in the ischemic myocardium when applied exogenously, causes ischemia-like changes, suggesting that LPC is one of the important factors in producing ischemia-reperfusion derangements in terms of mechanical and metabolic functions. He also found that prevention of LPC accumulation can protect heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury. In 1997 Ehsan Hoque was the first to demonstrate the potential protective effect of NHE (Na+-H+ Exchange) inhibition on Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) -induced cardiac injury. Activism As a young boy, Hoque was constantly bullied for wearing heavy eyeglasses and taking longer to do things due to poor vision. He cites this as a major source of his empathy for others who are disadvantaged through no fault of their own. Living in Bangladesh, he was surrounded by people in poverty and developed a deep appreciation for his own life. In his words, \\"I feel so lucky that I had parents who could give me food, clean water, a bed to sleep in, and treatment so I could see. If I was born into a poor family I would not be able to see the world today.\\" At a very young age, he involved himself in charitable activities with several organizations. During high school, he created a volunteer group and started to help underprivileged people, especially during natural disasters common to the country like cyclones and floods. As a young physician, Hoque undertook his own voluntary projects in remote villages teaching women about prenatal nutrition and distributing vegetable seeds and vitamin tablets to prevent the vitamin deficiency that contributed to his own partial blindness. During these trips, he saw small children dropping out of school and being sent to work in factories or as maids to support their families. He saw many of these children abused and tortured by their employers. In 1995, Hoque started supporting the education of 50 children to save them from child labor, and in the process realized a more systematic approach was necessary to help the many more children suffering the same fate in Bangladesh and elsewhere. This inspired him to form a non-governmental organization to prevent school dropouts on a large scale by providing comprehensive support through child sponsorship, creating a safety net, and involving school authorities and the community in the process. This dream was realized in 2003, while working at Yale University, together with his wife Dr. Nina Hoque, he founded Distressed Children & Infants International, or DCI. The organization's mission is to reduce the extreme poverty that contributes to child labor by providing quality education, family support, and access to healthcare with a focus on eliminating preventable blindness. Hoque's vision of child sponsorship has manifested itself in DCI's Sun Child Sponsorship Program, which now supports over 1500 children in Bangladesh. DCI operates several other programs in Bangladesh that provide healthcare, vision care, and orphan support, and also provides support to partner organizations with similar missions in India, Nepal, and Nicaragua. These efforts have benefited thousands of children and their families while also providing opportunities for American youth to connect with less fortunate around the world through volunteerism: a central organizational concept to DCI that Hoque calls \\"children helping children\\". Hoque believes that to help the thousands of distressed children around the world the many organizations working in this field should be united in one platform to exchange ideas and learn from each other's approach, successes, and failures. This belief has manifested in the biennial Conference on Child Rights & Sight: an international conference hosted by DCI and Yale University to raise awareness about child rights, particularly with respect to child labor, and diseases that affect vision. The event gathers speakers and leaders from around the world to address these issues and discuss creative solutions. The 7th conference took place at Yale in October 2019. Family Hoque lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts with his wife Nina Hoque and their two daughters Asahi and Sofia.

Based in Washington, D.C., the McCain Institute is part of Arizona State University. The executive director of the McCain Institute is Mark Green, former U.S. ambassador to Tanzania and administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. Goals Its work is focused on achieving immediate and long-range impact, through activities that improve the ability of leaders to make enlightened decisions in pursuit of the American and global interest. The work has four central themes: * Provide decision recommendations for leaders through open debate and rigorous analysis, by convening experts, publishing policy-relevant research, and holding decision-making exercises using advanced technology. * Identify and train new national security leaders, both American and foreign, in the public, private enterprise, and military spheres, including through fellowships and targeted training. * Play a unique role in a crowded intellectual space, including through the Sedona Forum and the McCain Debates and by serving as a Washington \\"decision tank\\". * Promote and preserve the McCain family spirit of character-driven leadership and national service, including hosting the McCain family archives. Funding Funding of the institute comes from a variety of individuals, foundations, and corporations, including Wal-Mart Stores, FedEx, Saudi Arabia, and hedge fund owner Paul E. Singer. Some of the funders have business before Congress, but during his life McCain's representative said such actions would not affect his votes. Initiatives =Sedona Forum= The Sedona Forum is the institute’s annual high-level gathering of national and international leaders held each spring at the Enchantment Resort in the red-rock country of Sedona, Arizona. The forum convenes global leaders, decision-makers, high-level executives, activists, and diverse experts to discuss solutions to real-world problems—all from the starting assumption of character-driven leadership and core democratic values. Previous guests have included Vice President Joe Biden, Ben Affleck, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The McCain Institute publishes an “Agenda for Action” reflecting the ideas discussed during the forum. Each year, the forum identifies a theme broad enough to incorporate a variety of views and produce practical recommendations. The 2013 forum focused on “How to Promote Freedom and Democracy Effectively.” Vice President Biden headlined the event, taking part in conversation with Senator McCain on national and international issues, from gun control to immigration to the global economy. The 2019 forum, the first since McCain's death, was opened by his son, Jack, also a Navy pilot. =Debate and Decision Series= The institute sponsors a series of debates. Among the issues debated include U.S. policy on: Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, the defense budget, Egypt and the Arab Spring, drone warfare, and Russia. The debates are followed by a private, non-attribution discussion among the debaters and the senior policymakers present. This creates a “safe environment” for political leaders to discuss issues honestly and without fear of political vulnerability or backlash. The debates have been expanded to other cities including Phoenix. Each debate brings in about 250 audience members and reaches thousands of people via live-streaming, television, and online viewers. The debates have featured speakers from the Brookings Institution, the American Enterprise Institute, The New Republic, The Atlantic, CNN, Fox News, the Wilson Center, Pepperdine University, Human Rights Watch, the Cato Institute, the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and the RAND Corporation. =Leadership Voices= The McCain Institute regularly invites senior leaders from the United States and around the world to share personal insights. The institute maintains a digital archive of these events, available online for students, journalists and scholars. Among the participants are New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, President Bill Clinton, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, former Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks, former Georgian Foreign Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili, and former President of Colombia Álvaro Uribe.http://mccaininstitute.org/work/leadership-voices/ =Washington Policy Design Studio= The Washington Policy Design Studio brings Arizona State University students to Washington, D.C., for a semester of intensive class work on the art of foreign policy-making, combined with a D.C. internship.

A racialized society is a society that has undergone strong racialization, where perceived race matters profoundly for life experiences, opportunities, and interpersonal relationships. A racialized society can also be said to be \\"a society that allocates differential economic, political, social, and even psychological rewards to groups along perceived racial lines; lines that are socially constructed.\\" United States It is argued that racial/ethnic identity are not separate or autonomous categories and what is called 'racial categories' in the United States are actually racialized ethnic categories. United States society is considered by some a racialized society in which divisions between the racial/ethnic groups are given. Critical race theory argues that racism is normal and is engrained [sic] in the fabric and system of the American society. There are ongoing racial disparities between races in the United States in employment, housing, religion, and race-conscious institutions. Some scholars argue a \\"privileged/non-privileged dynamic\\" exists. This means that cultural practice assigns value and assumed competence to people who have certain characteristics or features. The social psychological approach maintains that prejudice socialized early in life feeds racial stereotypes. Contributors are Lawrence Bobo, Gretchen C. Crosby, Michael C. Dawson, Christopher Federico, P.J. Henry, John J. Hetts, Jennifer L. Hochschild, William G. Howell, Michael Hughes, Donald R. Kinder, Rick Kosterman, Tali Mendelberg, Thomas F. Pettigrew, Howard Schuman, David O. Sears, James Sidanius, Pam Singh, Paul M. Sniderman, Marylee C. Taylor, and Steven A. Tuch. It is often said that social interaction is infused with a privileged / non- privileged dynamic which is defined by racial identity — is very complex issue. Racialization hurts both the privileged and the non-privileged, but hurts the non-privileged most. Until the 1960s there was legal racial discrimination in the United States. The end of legal discrimination produced major improvements, but scarcely was successful in wiping the slate clean of the many legacies of more than three centuries of formalized state supported inequality. Even after the era of official social discrimination and segregation the lingering residual practices kept African Americans in lower- caste status. Racial problems were viewed as the nation's \\"most important problem\\" and many observers felt the United States was in a state of racial crisis. Racially related issues, such as welfare, crime, segregation, \\"permissive judges\\", affirmative action, group based rights, difference-blind treatment, and government regulation and state neutrality with respect to group, have been the subject of strenuous political debate and legislation in the past three decades. Significant gaps between blacks and whites in most domains that measure the quality of life continue to exist. Effective standards designed to eliminate discrimination, often described as race- conscious remedies, have been intensely debated. Supporters argue that institutional racism is so deeply and subtly embedded in the fabric of American society that little would change if more proactive methods of eliminating discrimination had been used.

Peter Bell: A Tale in Verse is a long narrative poem by William Wordsworth, written in 1798, but not published until 1819.  Synopsis  In a tone of straight-faced humourGill 1990, pp. 140–141. the prologue tells of the poet's travels over the face of the earth and through the heavens in a boat of the imagination, which urges him to choose some exotic or otherworldly theme. The poet rejects the suggestion, and opts for the more homely subject of Peter Bell. The poem proper begins with a description of him as a hard-hearted sinner, impervious to the softening influence of nature, who makes his living as an itinerant hawker (or potter, in Wordsworth's northern expression) of earthenware. One night, while walking through Swaledale by night, he loses his way. He comes across an ass standing untended, gazing into the river Swale, and he tries to ride away on it, but the ass does not respond to his furious beating of it. Peter sees the face of a corpse in the river, and faints from shock. On recovering consciousness he drags the dead man, once the owner of the ass, onto dry land. The ass now consents to start for home, taking Peter with him. A loud cry is heard in the distance, which, though Peter does not know it, comes from the dead man's young son, who is searching for his father. Unnerved by this, and by the sight of the bloody wounds he has inflicted on the ass, Peter begins to feel unaccustomed pangs of conscience. His mind turns to his many past sins, and as he passes an outdoor Methodist meeting his heart responds to the preacher's calls for repentance. The ass reaches the home of the dead man, whose wife is waiting for him. She learns that she is a widow, and her children orphans. > And now is Peter taught to feel > That man's heart is a holy thing; > And Nature, through a world of death, > Breathes into him a second breath, > More searching than the breath of spring.Line 1071 The poem closes with Peter downcast by his experiences, but eventually emerging as a better man.  Composition and publication  First edition title page In 1793, while walking in the Wye Valley, Wordsworth fell in with a \\"wild rover\\" who, as he later recalled, \\"told me strange stories\\" as they wandered together. Five years later he drew on his memories of this vagrant for a new poem. Wordsworth began writing Peter Bell on 20 April 1798, and by late May of that year was able to read it aloud at Alfoxden to William Hazlitt. Though the poem was first written during the final preparations for his and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads Wordsworth did not choose to include it in that collection.Pinion 1988, pp. 31–32. In February 1799 he reported that he had been performing some cuts on Peter Bell. In February 1802 he revised it again, and the following month talked of publishing it, perhaps with \\"The Ruined Cottage\\" or \\"Adventures on Salisbury Plain\\", but for the moment nothing came of this. Gill 1990, pp. 164, 193–194. One more revision in 1812 was followed by plans for publication in 1815, again abandoned. Peter Bell was finally published in April 1819, with four sonnets to accompany it, and with a dedication to his friend Robert Southey.Pinion 1988, p. 109. Gill 1990, p. 333. Reception John Hamilton Reynolds, reading about the impending publication, wrote a Wordsworth parody called Peter Bell: a Lyrical Ballad, which appeared a week before the genuine Peter Bell and stirred up enough public interest to ensure that Wordsworth's poem went into a second edition within a fortnight.Gill 1990, pp. 331–332. In contemporary journals the poem was, like his previous publications, generally greeted with derision and contempt, critics being especially provoked by the deliberately flat diction and by the mundanity of its subject, as exemplified in Peter Bell's own prosaic name. Leigh Hunt, writing in The Examiner, condemned Peter Bell as \\"a didactic little horror…founded on the bewitching principles of fear, bigotry, and diseased impulse\\". Other reviewers spoke of its \\"gross perversion of intellect\\" and \\"tincture of imbecility\\", and pronounced it \\"superlatively silly\\", \\"daudling, impotent drivel\\" and \\"of all Mr. Wordsworth's poems…decidedly the worst\\". Gill 1990, p. 332. Byron, in his Don Juan, sneered that Wordsworth \\"makes / Another outcry for 'a little boat', / And drivels seas to set it well afloat\\". Even close friends could offer little comfort. Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth that though he liked the poem's subject \\"I cannot say that the style of it quite satisfies me. It is too lyrical,\\" and he privately said that he thought it one of the worst of Wordsworth's works. Henry Crabb Robinson feared Wordsworth had \\"set himself back ten years by the publication of this unfortunate work\\". Gill 1990, p. 332. In the months after the publication of Wordsworth's poem and Reynolds' skit a whole rash of Wordsworth parodies broke out, by Keats and Shelley among others. Wordsworth responded to this general damnation of Peter Bell by revising it when he included it in his 1820 collected edition, Miscellaneous Poems, though he also wrote a sonnet \\"On the Detraction which followed the Publication of a certain Poem\\" in which he told Peter \\"Heed not such onset!\\".Gill 1990, pp. 336–337. Opinion was slow to change in Peter Bell’s favour. In 1879 Matthew Arnold counted it among the poems which only a true Wordsworthian such as himself could read with pleasure, and in 1891 Oscar Wilde cited it as an example of the deleterious influence of Nature on Wordsworth's poetry. Modern Wordsworth critics generally rank Peter Bell high among its author's works, full credit being given to its daring as a \\"radical experiment\\". Duncan Wu numbered it among Wordsworth's greatest poems, while Mary Moorman called it \\"his most brilliant narrative poem\\".

He took up fencing at the age of eight and, in 2008, began fencing internationally, winning medals at the African and World Junior Championships, as well as the Junior World Cup, before progressing to the senior level in 2011 and capturing bronze at the Fleuret de St-Petersbourg. Later that year he earned gold medals at the 2011 Pan Arab Games in the individual and team foil events before progressing to the 2012 Summer Games, where he won Africa's first ever Olympic fencing medal. Early life Abouelkassem was born on 25 November 1990 in Sétif, Algeria to an Egyptian father and an Algerian mother and moved to Egypt at the age of four. Growing up in Alexandria, he first became athletically involved in swimming and karate before beginning his training in fencing at age of eight in the city's Al- Selah Al-Sakandry club. After successes in the sport at a young age, he was forced to give it up upon entering the Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport, as the program was too demanding for him to pursue engineering studies and fencing. He was soon re-discovered by his former coach, Mohamed El-Sayed, who nominated him to join the national team. Career Abouelkassem's international career began in 2008, when he captured a gold medal in foil fencing at the African Junior Championships and bronze at the World Junior Fencing Championships in Italy, in addition to one third- place finish at the Junior Fencing World Cup. At the 2009 Junior Fencing World Cup he earned another third place win and followed up with gold one year later at the 2010 World Junior Fencing Championships. He earned his first World Cup medal as a senior, bronze, at the 2011 Fleuret de St-Petersbourg, and captured gold at the 2011 Pan Arab Games in the individual and team foil events. Abouelkassem qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics and entered the individual foil event in the round of 32, defeating American Miles Chamley-Watson 15-10. He had the same result against Peter Joppich of Germany and Andrea Cassarà of Italy in the round of 16 and quarterfinals respectively, before moving on to defeat Choi Byung-Chul of South Korea 15-12 in the semi-finals. Abouelkassem lost the gold medal match 13-15 to Lei Sheng of China, but the silver medal he won was the first Olympic fencing medal for a competitor representing an African nation. He also participated in the team foil event, where the Egyptians were eliminated by the British team by a score of 45-33 in the opening round. At the 2013 Mediterranean Games, Abouelkassem won a bronze medal in the individual foil. , he is coached by Paul Kantorsky of Poland. At the 2015 African Games he won gold medals in the men's individual and team foil events.

Accounts of cannibalism date back as far as prehistoric times, and some anthropologists suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies as early as the Paleolithic Era. Historically, numerous tribal societies have engaged in cannibalism, although very few are thought to continue the practice to this day. Occasionally, starving people have resorted to cannibalism for survival necessity. Classical antiquity recorded numerous references to cannibalism during siege starvations. More recent well-documented examples include the Essex sinking in 1820, the Donner Party in 1846 and 1847, and the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571. Some murderers, such as Albert Fish, Boone Helm, Andrei Chikatilo, and Jeffrey Dahmer, are known to have devoured their victims after killing them. Other individuals, such as artist Rick Gibson and journalist William Seabrook, have legally consumed human flesh out of curiosity, or to attract attention to themselves.

Finds made in the El Sidrón cave in Spain also show evidence of endo-cannibalism. * Cheddar Man, a human skeleton dating from around 7150 BC, may have been a victim of cannibalism. *Genetic studies have revealed a \\"powerful episode\\" of natural selection concurrent with the extinction of the Neanderthals. Drawing on hundreds of studies in relation to the kuru disease which is only known to spread through cannibalism, researchers conclude that the 127V gene, which is known only for resisting kuru-like diseases, evidences widespread cannibalism among recent humans. If humans and neanderthals, who co-existed with each other at that time, practised cannibalism together, it is theorised this gene would have protected humans from the kuru-like diseases, but led to the neanderthals deaths, perhaps even their extinction.

While he was suffering, a procession of nine fellow rebels who had been starved beforehand were led to this throne. Next, executioners removed some pliers from a fire and forced them into Dózsa's skin. After tearing his flesh, the remaining rebels were ordered to bite spots where the hot pliers had been inserted and to swallow the flesh. The three or four who refused were simply cut up, prompting the others to comply. In the end, Dózsa died from the ordeal, while the rebels who obeyed were released. *In 1563 French settlers from Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site are reported to have resorted to cannibalism while fleeing back to Europe. *Peter Stumpp, nicknamed the \\"Werewolf of Bedburg\\", was executed in October 1589 after accusations of cannibalism and other crimes. =1600s= *In colonial Jamestown, Virginia, United States, colonists resorted to cannibalism during a period from 1609 to 1610 known as the Starving Time.

The account given by the two seamen covers a period from mid-1735 when they first set sail until January 1736 when they were rescued by Glanveil Nicholas, master of a schooner, who picked them up close to and landed them in Bridgetown, Barbados, where they gave their sworn disposition. The men described in some detail (around 800 words) how the ship sprung a leak, the slaves were unchained to help pump, how the ship finally sank, how eight men abandoned ship and some later ate human flesh as a means of surviving before Thompson and McCrone were rescued.The Gentleman's Magazine, July 1737, pp.449-450, https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hw2936;view=1up;seq=449 *June 1752, Ottawa and Chippewa massacre British trade posts at Fort Pickawillany, boiling and cannibalizing residents and traders. *In 1763, North American Indians performed an act of ritual cannibalism on a British soldier during the Siege of Fort Detroit. =1800s= Raft of the Medusa by Théodore Géricault, 1819 *In an 1809 incident known as the Boyd massacre, about 66 passengers and crew of the Boyd were killed and eaten by Māori on the Whangaroa peninsula, Northland, in northern New Zealand. *Following the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the ill-fated retreat saw some Napoleon's soldiers resorted to cannibalism when facing starvation in the Russian winter. *In 1816, the French frigate Méduse ran aground off Mauritania, and 147 passengers and crew took to sea on a hastily constructed raft. In the chaotic 13 days before they were rescued, the occupants of the raft were driven to suicide, murder, and cannibalism; only 15 men survived the experience. *The Essex was sunk by a sperm whale in the Pacific Ocean, in 1820. Most survivors of Captain Pollard's ship spent 90 days in small whaling boats before being rescued. Seven of the members who died during the 90 days were documented to have been eaten, some after they died, two others who were sacrificed for that purpose after drawing lots. One of the small boats was found containing two survivors sucking on the marrow of a human bone. The tale of the Essex inspired Herman Melville to write his novel, Moby-Dick (1851). *In 1822, Alexander Pearce, an Irish convict, led an escape from Macquarie Harbour Penal Settlement in Van Diemen's Land. Pearce was captured near Hobart and confessed that he and the other escapees had successively killed and cannibalised members of their group over a period of weeks, he being the last survivor. *The May 27, 1826 issue of The Acadian Recorder reported that the surviving crew of the ship Francis Mary resorted to cannibalism. *According to the Coffin Handbills, Andrew Jackson murdered 1,000 Native Americans.

The latter are depicted as drinking the blood of three beheaded crew members, while five other people are still alive and waiting a similar fate. It is unclear if the crew were from a British ship or a Maltese brigantine. The painting was commissioned or possibly painted by Michele Cachia, who might have been the sole survivor, and he attributed his survival to divine intervention. *Liver-Eating Johnson reportedly ate the livers of Crow warriors he had previously slain. *In the United States, the group of settlers known as the Donner Party resorted to cannibalism while snowbound in the Sierra Nevada mountains, for the winter of 1846–1847. *The last survivors of Captain Sir John Franklin's lost arctic expedition of 1845 were found to have resorted to cannibalism in their final push across King William Island, Canada, towards the Back River. *Boone Helm, also known as \\"The Kentucky Cannibal\\", was an American mountain man, serial killer, and fugitive, who ate human flesh on several occasions between 1850 and 1854, often out of necessity in extreme conditions.

Almost all members of the expedition were massacred by hostile Tuaregs at Bir el-Garama in February 1881. The majority of the expedition's 93 men were killed and the over 200 camels seized by the Tuaregs, but 56 survivors, including 4 Frenchmen, began a 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) retreat by foot to Ouargla with little food or water. Continuously stalked by the Tuaregs, the survivors resorted to cannibalism on the long retreat through the desert. Only seven of the original 93 men survived. *The case of R v. Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273 (QB) is an English case which dealt with four crew members of an English yacht, the Mignonette, who were cast away in a storm some from the Cape of Good Hope. After several days, one of the crew, a 17-year-old cabin boy, fell unconscious due to a combination of starvation and drinking seawater. The others (one possibly objecting) decided then to kill him and eat him. They were picked up four days later. Two of the three survivors were found guilty of murder. A significant outcome of this case was that necessity was determined to be no defence against a charge of murder. *A report dated to July 28, 1892 indicates that three people were convicted on charges of cannibalism in the Sahalin penal colony. Two songs referencing cannibalism were also recorded among the residents of the colony.Новодворский В., Дорошевич В. Коронка в пиках до валета.

He confessed to molesting more than 400 children over 20 years and is believed to have murdered somewhere between 6 and 15 children. Psychiatrist Fredric Wertham described Fish as looking like \\"a meek and innocuous little old man, gentle and benevolent, friendly and polite. If you wanted someone to entrust your child to, he would be the one you would choose\\". Fish's most infamous murder is that of Grace Budd in 1928, whose flesh he cut into strips, and cooked with carrots, onions, and strips of bacon. This excited him sexually. Wertham described how Fish's account of the culinary process was \\"like a housewife describing her favorite methods of cooking. You had to remind yourself that this was a little girl he was talking about\\". When the same psychiatrist declared Fish mad, Fish disagreed and stated he was just \\"queer\\". *On December 20, 1924, German authorities uncovered pieces of human flesh along with a list of 40 people Karl Denke had previously killed and cannibalized. =1930s= *Author James Crissmman claims that reports from the 1930s indicate that residents of the Appalachian Mountains practised a form of ritualistic cannibalism, during which cannibals ate parts of their dead relatives in order to honour them. *Before 1931, The New York Times reporter William Buehler Seabrook, allegedly in the interests of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the Sorbonne a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, : \\"It was like good, developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable\\". *Cannibalism was widespread during the Holodomor (famine of Ukraine) in 1932 and 1933. *On December 9, 1934, grave robber and suspected serial killer Alonzo Robinson was arrested for the axe-slaying of the Turner couple in their Cleveland, Mississippi home.

Almost all of them were sent to POW camps in Siberia or Central Asia where, due to being chronically underfed by their Soviet captors, many resorted to cannibalism. Fewer than 5,000 of the prisoners taken at Stalingrad survived captivity. The majority, however, died early in their imprisonment due to exposure or sickness brought on by conditions in the surrounded army before the surrender. * In November 1942, Finnish soldiers discovered the remains of a Soviet partisan, butchered and eaten by his comrades in Seesjärvi. There are also accounts of cannibalism in Karelia during the 1920s Heimosodat wars. * Cannibalism took place in the concentration and death camps in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi German puppet state which was governed by the fascist Ustasha organization, who committed the Genocide of Serbs and the Holocaust in NDH. Some survivors testified that some of the Ustashas drank the blood from the slashed throats of the victims. *The Australian War Crimes Section of the Tokyo Tribunal, led by prosecutor William Webb (the future Judge-in-Chief), collected numerous written reports and testimonies that documented Japanese soldiers' acts of cannibalism among their own troops, on enemy dead, and on Allied prisoners of war in many parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In September 1942, Japanese daily rations on New Guinea consisted of 800 grams of rice and tinned meat. However, by December, this had fallen to 50 grams. According to historian Yuki Tanaka, \\"cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers\\". :In some cases, flesh was cut from living people. An Indian POW, Lance Naik Hatam Ali (later a citizen of Pakistan), testified that in New Guinea: \\"the Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place by the Japanese. The remainder of us were taken to another spot away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive and they were thrown into a ditch where they later died.\\" *Another well-documented case occurred in Chichijima in February 1945, when Japanese soldiers killed and consumed five American airmen.

After having sex with the corpse, he began to eat her, starting with the buttocks and thighs. A few days later, he was discovered while attempting to dump the mutilated body into a lake and was subsequently arrested. He was held for two years without trial, then declared legally insane. Soon afterward, Japanese author Inuhiko Yomota published Sagawa's memoirs, including a detailed account of the murder. The book was a bestseller, and Sagawa became a minor celebrity. However, he was quickly extradited to Japan, where mental health professionals announced that he was perfectly sane. Because the French government refused to grant access to secret court documents, the Japanese authorities were unable to bring charges against him. He was released in 1986, and moved to Tokyo where he is making a living as a freelance writer. *Ladislav Hojer, a serial killer from Czechoslovakia, confessed to killing a young woman in 1981.

It is situated within the Rudding Park estate at Follifoot on the southern outskirts of Harrogate. It is a two-storey building made of ashlar with a Westmorland slate roof, designed in the style of the Wyatts by an unknown architect. Golf Rudding Park has an 18-hole golf course and is located on 18th-century parkland. The Signature hole is called Rhododendron Glade and is the 14th hole. Located at the golf academy is a cutting edge golf simulation software operated by Grooves Golf where visitors can play on golf courses from around the world including Cypress Point. History Rudding Park was originally part of the Forest of Knaresborough and still retains some of the ancient oak trees. In the early 18th century Rudding was owned in turn by Messrs Williamson of Wetherby, Craddock, James Collins (who enlarged the house and planted avenues in the park) and Thomas Wilson. In 1788 Alexander Wedderburn, Lord Loughborough, the future Lord Chancellor, acquired the estate and called in the garden designer Humphry Repton to remodel the landscape. Chapel, Rudding Park In 1805, the estate was purchased by the Hon. William Gordon,son of George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aberdeen who demolished the original house and commissioned the building of the present house in a new location. In 1824 the estate was sold to Sir Joseph Radcliffe, Bt.Sir Joseph Radcliffe, 2nd Baronet with the new house still unfinished. He secured architect Robert Chantrell to oversee its completion. Once completed, the house consisted of two storeys, with no second floor or attic, and was made of ashlar with a Westmorland slate roof. London architect A.E. Purdie designed a Gothic Revival chapel which was built in 1874 for Sir Percival Radcliffe, the 3rd Baronet. The chapel is the size of a parish church and constructed from Aberdeen granite and alabaster. Several generations of the Radcliffe family then occupied the house for 150 years. The Granada television series which screened in 1971 called Seasons of the Year was filmed here. This consisted of six plays involving the various occupants of the house over a 150-year period from the Napoleonic wars to the 1970s. In some ways this series was almost a precursor to the later TV series Brideshead Revisited, where the house was almost a character in its own right. In 1972 the estate was acquired for £1.2m by John Howard Mackaness, a landowner, businessman and master of foxhounds. The Mackaness family remain the owners to the present day. In recent times the estate has been heavily developed, with the opening of Rudding Holiday Park in 1973 and the use of the house as a conference and banqueting centre in 1987.Rudding Park Hotel, Spa and Golf website \\"History\\". Online reference http://www.ruddingpark.co.uk/about-us/history/ In the early 1980s the redundant farms buildings to the north of the site were sold for a private housing development called Rudding Dower.

Recreation includes fishing, hunting, boating via multiple marinas and boat ramps, camping, and hiking.http://www.recreation.gov/recAreaDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&recAreaId;=81&agencyCode;=129 The northern shore borders the Sherman Reservoir State Recreational Area. Primitive camping includes 360 non-pad sites. Facilities include picnic tables, shelters, water, dump station, modern restrooms, vault toilets, four boat ramps, fish cleaning stations, coin-operated showers and concession. Cabin rental and RV camping pads are available. Sherman Reservoir is a popular fishing location in central Nebraska. The most popular species sought by anglers are walleye, crappie, catfish, white bass, and northern pike. Fishing typically begins in March when northern pike can be caught in the shallow waters of coves and bays. Fishing for walleye during their April spawning period is very popular. Walleye fishing usually peaks in May–June. White bass fishing typically has two peaks—one in April–May and the second peak in mid- summer. Crappie catches are excellent in May as the reservoir fills and flooded habitat is available in the coves and bays. Ice-fishing for crappie and walleye can also be productive over submerged cover or habitat. Channel catfish provide good angling opportunities throughout the summer months, and large flathead catfish provide the possibility for trophy-sized fish.

The incident took place on the border of Manchukuo and Mongolia near the Buddhist temple of Khalkhyn (Temple of Khalkha), located northeast of Buir Lake in present-day Inner Mongolia, China. Scores of the cavalry of the Mongolian People's Army engaged with patrol units of the Manchukuo Imperial Army and Japanese soldiers. Attack On 8 January 1935, a Mongolian cavalry unit consisting of 90 horsemen ambushed a Manchukuo Imperial Army (MIA) stationed around the vicinity of Khalkhyn Temple in disputed border territory. During the reconnaissance around midday a patrol of about 30 MIA soldiers overseen by several Japanese military advisors setting up base along the lines. An ambush then took place wiping out the entire patrol, killing 11 Manchukuo soldiers along with several Japanese advisors and volunteers. However the attack wasn't as swift as planned, at least 23 cavalrymen were gunned down by a machine-gun nest by the time they reached the patrol. As the Mongolians were charging at the defenders many of them were gunned down from Japanese machine gun-fire, resulting in dozens of deaths and at least 40 more were injured out of the 90 or so men. Among the dead was Bataar Enkhjargal, a noted and well respected Mongolian commander. But most of the cavalry managed to make it through the defense into the Manchukuoan base. After less than 30 minutes of fighting the imperial army broke apart and was forced to retreat, giving the Mongolians control of most of the present-day Outer Mongolia territory. A Soviet official claimed that 23 Mongolians were killed in the incident including the commander, but the Japanese put the number much higher (40 killed). The Japanese claimed to have lost one officer and several other soldiers in the fighting, while their puppet Manchukuo lost up-to 10 soldiers. Reactions This incident created great tension between Mongolia and Japan, with the death of a high ranked Japanese officer. This incident was the first of many Mongolian/Soviet-Japanese border conflicts.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1975. History The building is the only known surviving log jail in the state and the only public building surviving from the time that the county seat was located in Houston. It is believed by architectural historians to have been built circa 1868, when the now destroyed courthouse is known to have been constructed. Houston was made the seat in 1858, but the minutes from a grand jury meeting in 1867 reported the need to build a courthouse and a jail. The county seat was moved to Double Springs in 1884, resulting in Houston shrinking to the small unincorporated community that it is today. It was converted into a residence for the poor in 1933, with the original split shake roof replaced with one of galvanized metal at this time. The roof has since been restored back to shake. Architecture The jail is built of large squared logs joined by half notched corners. It measures with a front gabled roof. The interior is divided into two rooms with an interlocking log wall. A full raised foundation of fieldstone supports the structure. The interior of the cell features continuous boards, turned at right angles to the logs and secured in place with wooden nails to prevent prisoners from sawing their way out. Likewise, the ceiling is formed by closely spaced logs and the floor is plank over similarly spaced logs. The small square windows originally featured meshed iron bars. The original door was made of three solid layers of plank boards laid at angles to one another.

He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1807, graduated A.B. 1811, M.B. 1814, M.D. 1818, and was incorporated M.D. at Oxford on his Dublin degree on 22 October 1818. He says himself that he spent seven years in clinical study at Irish, British, and continental hospitals before he sought a fee, but about 1815 must have settled in London, was admitted candidate (member) of the College of Physicians on 22 December 1818, and fellow on 22 December 1819. He was censor of the college in 1823, and councillor from 1852 to 1855. Billing was long connected with the London Hospital, to which foundation, after having been engaged in teaching there since 1817, he was elected physician on 2 July 1822. In 1823 he began a course of clinical lectures. He ceased to lecture in 1836, and resigned the post of physician on 4 June 1845. On the foundation of the university of London in 1836, Billing was invited to become a member of the senate, and occupied an influential position on that body for many years. He was also for a considerable time examiner in medicine. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and an active member of other scientific and medical societies. After a long and distinguished professional career, Billing retired from practice many years before his death, which occurred on 2 September 1881 at his house in Park Lane. Perhaps the last London physician to visit his patients on horseback, he is buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery, London. Medical works * First Principles of Medicine, 1st ed. 1831; 6th ed. 1868. * On the Treatment of Asiatic Cholera, 1st ed. 1848. * Practical Observations on Diseases of the Lungs and Heart, 1852. * Clinical Lectures, published in the Lancet, 1831, and several papers in other medical journals. Billing drew on his experience in a well-known manual, The First Principles of Medicine, which, from its first issue in 1831 that was hardly more than a pamphlet, grew to a bulky text-book. It ran to six editions. He restated them in the London Medical Gazette (1840, xxvi. 64), and also in his Practical Observations on Diseases of the Lungs and Heart, a work less successful than the Principles of Medicine. Interests and views Billing began as a medical innovator, though came in the end to be conservative, and was opposed to what he regarded as the teachings of the German school. He gave special attention to diseases of the chest, and was among the earliest medical teachers in London to make auscultation part of regular instruction. His original views respecting the cause of the sounds of the heart were first put forth in 1832. His avowed aim was to base medicine on pathology; a lucid writer, he also stretched a point in favour of logical accuracy. He was a cultured man, with accomplishments not professional. He was an amateur artist, and a connoisseur in engraved gems and coins, and similar objects. On this area he published The Science of Gems, Jewels, Coins, and Medals, Ancient and Modern, 1867, which contained a fragmentary autobiography of Benedetto Pistrucci, translated by Billing's wife. An elaborate text-book, illustrated with photographs, it reached a second edition. As a musical amateur, Billing on 12 May 1833 hosted in his home a trio of Mendelssohn, Paganini and the cellist Robert Lindley.

He was imprisoned in the 1990s, and again from 2007 until his release on humanitarian grounds on 23 June 2011 at the age of 74–75. In November 2011 he was convicted of \\"breaking allegiance with the King\\" and possessing literature by Madawi al-Rasheed and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment followed by a 15-year travel ban. , his conviction was pending appeal at the Specialized Criminal Court. Legal and human rights career Al-Reshoudi is a lawyer who had the status of judge for two decades. He was one of the founding members of the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR), created in 1993 during calls by Saudi Arabian intellectuals for reform. He was arrested along with other reformists. He has represented many prisoners held without charge or trial. In 2006 and 2007, prior to his own arrest during the 2 February 2007 mass arrest, al-Reshoudi helped detainees to try to sue Mabahith over their arbitrary detention by filing cases with the Grievances Board. Al-Reshoudi has sent reports about \\"countless\\" political prisoners to United Nations Special Rapporteurs. Arrests =1990s= Al- Reshoudi was detained in the 1990s during an arrest campaign against reformists, including CDLR members. He remained in prison for five years. =2007–2011= Al-Reshoudi was arrested again on 2 February 2007. On 28 November 2007, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that al-Reshoudi and the other 2 February 2007 detainees were held illegally. In 2009, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) stated that al-Reshoudi had been severely tortured. Al-Reshoudi's legal defence team filed a court case in the Grievances Board against the Ministry of Interior/Mabahith on 16 August 2009 on the grounds that the detentions were arbitrary. Eight court sessions were held. Mabahith representatives were officially absent from four of the sessions, including the final session on 28 August 2010. The eighth (final) session was attended by representatives of ACPRA, the Human Rights First Society, the National Society for Human Rights, and international journalists. Mabahith plainclothes agents were present in the corridors near the courtroom and in the courtroom itself and tried to prevent human rights organisation representatives and journalists from entering the courtroom. ACPRA described the official absence as \\"contempt of the judiciary\\". The presiding judge stated that the Ministry of Interior had informed the Grievances Board the previous night, 27 August 2010, that al-Reshoudi and the other detainees had been tried in court in Jeddah. Al-Reshoudi's defence team stated that the Jeddah trial consisted of the detainees appearing with hands and legs chained before an unidentified \\"judge-like individual\\" from an unidentified institution, and did not constitute an appearance before a competent court. The judge dismissed the case against Mabahith \\"for lack of jurisdiction\\". In January 2011, ACPRA and the Human Rights First Society complained to King Abdullah about the torture of the septuagenarian judge, whose feet were reportedly chained to his bed each night and who was forced to sit up during the day. As of March 2011, he was held in al-Ha'ir Prison. On 20 March 2011, during the 2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests, al-Reshoudi's daughter Dana al-Reshoudi visited the Ministry of Interior in Riyadh along with 30 other women and 200 men to ask for their \\"husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons\\" to be released. Dana al-Reshoudi and other women were detained and interrogated in al-Ha'ir Prison for the night and released when their male guardians arrived at the prison and signed to release them. Suliman al- Reshoudi was released on 23 June 2011 for health reasons but the charges against him remained. On 22 November 2011, al-Reshoudi was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, to be followed by 15 years' travel ban. Two of the charges he was convicted on were \\"breaking allegiance with the King\\" and \\"possessing banned articles by Professor Madawi al-Rasheed\\". Along with other reformists sentenced on the same day, al-Reshoudi filed an appeal against his conviction in the Specialized Criminal Court on 23 January 2012. Amnesty International representative Philip Luther criticised the convictions of al- Reshoudi and the other reformists, stating, \\"Some of these charges appear to be criminalizing the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression, including advocacy of political change. In these cases, the convictions should be quashed. Even the seemingly more serious charges on which some of the 16 men were convicted, such as money laundering, need to be re-examined carefully, as the convictions followed a grossly unfair trial.\\" Amnesty International called for the appeals to follow the international standards for fair trials.

Prompted by the replacement of large parts of the local nobility with Ottoman landowners, centralized governance, and the Ottoman taxation system, the population and the nobles, led principally by Gjergj Arianiti, revolted against the Ottomans. During the early phases of the revolt, many land (timar) holders were killed or expelled. As it spread, the nobles, whose holdings had been annexed by the Ottomans returned to join the revolt and attempts to form alliances with the Holy Roman Empire were initiated. While the leaders of the revolt were successful in defeating successive Ottoman campaigns, they failed to capture many important towns of the sanjak of Albania. Protracted sieges like that of Gjirokastër, capital of the sanjak, gave the Ottoman army time to assemble large forces from other parts of the empire and to subdue the main revolt by the end of 1436. Ottoman forces conducted a number of massacres in the aftermath of the revolt. After the revolt had largely been suppressed, those who accepted Ottoman suzerainty were initially allowed to retain their holdings and partial autonomy. Many timars were also granted to local Albanians holding high posts of the administration, especially during the rule of Yakup Bey Muzaka and Skanderbeg. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily rural areas were still in revolt and new rebellions erupted, like that of Theodor Corona Musachi in 1437. As the empire further extended its area of rule in the Balkans, centralization attempts and the replacement of local timar holders with Ottoman landowners resumed. These policies would lead in part to the formation of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444, and a new era in the Ottoman–Albanian wars.  Background  alt=Albania under Ottoman control in 1431 Gradually in the late 14th and early 15th century the Ottoman Empire defeated local Albanian principalities, forming the sanjak of Albania as an administrative division of the empire. As part of the Timar system the local feudal lords were largely replaced with Ottomans from Anatolia. The cadastral survey (defter) of 1431–1432 indicates that about 75% to 80% of the timars were granted to Ottoman Muslim spahis (feudal cavalry), while the remainder and especially remote areas, which were not under full Ottoman control, were granted to Albanian spahis, both Christian and Muslim. The replacement of the existing nobility with the timar system led to conflicts, as a result of which many rural areas were not under complete Ottoman rule. Under the previous taxation code, farmers were required to pay a tenth of their seasonal agricultural output, 1 ducat and 4 groshe (two-ninths of a ducat) to their lords. The Ottoman system aimed towards revenue increase to support military expenses, thus new taxes were imposed and existing ones were altered. In addition to 1/10 of agrarian production Muslim convert families were required to pay 22 akçe (~0.6 ducats) to the timar holders, while non-Muslim families had to pay 25 akçe (~0.7 ducats). Both groups were subject to additional taxes including the avarız, an annual cash tax that affected households registered to the cadasters. Non-Muslims were also required to pay 45 akçe (~1.3 ducats) as part of the jizya and had to supply regularly the Ottoman state with young recruits in accordance with the devşirme, which required the enlistment of young males in the Ottoman army and their conversion to Islam. Consequently, the changes in property rights, relations between feudal lords and peasants, the taxation system and the enactment of devşirme resulted in further resistance. As changes affecting both nobles and peasants were principally implemented through registration in the cadastral survey, many families tried to avoid becoming registered in the 1431–2 survey and took refugee in mountainous areas, while the nobility prepared for armed conflict.  Revolt  The castle of Gjirokastër was besieged by alt=Castle of Gjirokastër The revolt began in 1432 when Andrea Thopia defeated a small Ottoman force in central Albania. His victory encouraged the other leaders and the revolt spread throughout Albania. Later that year the Ottomans lost control of the central seaport of Vlorë. Gjergj Arianiti, who was living at the Ottoman court as a hostage, was called by rebels to lead the revolt in his family's domains. In response, he fled from Edirne and returned to Albania. In the winter of 1432, Sultan Murat II gathered around 10,000 troops under Ali Bey, who marched along the Via Egnatia and reached the central valley of Shkumbin, where he was ambushed and defeated by forces under Gjergj Arianiti. His victory prompted the Albanians in the area of Gjirokastër to call upon Depë Zenebishi, who had settled in his estates in Corfu after the Ottoman conquest of the Principality of Gjirokastër, to lead the rebels in the south. After spreading the revolt in nearby areas including Këlcyrë, Zagorie and Pogon his forces besieged the southern city of Gjirokastër, capital of the sanjak of Albania. At nearby Këlcyrë the rebels captured the castle, but the concurrent siege of Gjirokastër was prolonged and Turahan Bey attacked and defeated the troops that surrounded the city in early 1433. Zenebishi himself was captured and executed. In the summer of 1433 an army led by Sinan Pasha, beylerbey of Rumelia, pillaged the areas of Kanina and Yannina and moved northwards, where they subdued the rebels in the domains of Gjon Kastrioti, who was reduced again to vassal status, while his son Skanderbeg, who was also called to join the revolt, remained in Ottoman service in Anatolia. In August 1433, the senate of Venice convened to evaluate the situation and deemed that the revolt posed a threat to the Venetian territories in the region too. However, by the end of October they re-evaluated the crisis and rejected the deployment of a war galley to the Venetian colonies. In northern Albania Nicholas Dukagjini captured territories of the pre-Ottoman Principality of Dukagjini and besieged and captured Dagnum. Dukagjini then tried to ally himself with Venice by offering to accept Venetian suzerainty and granting them control of Dagnum. However, Venice refused any kind of involvement in his plan and the revolt in general. Dukagjini was not aware that Hasan Bey, the Ottoman governor of Dagnum, had requested Venetian assistance after his defeat. As Venice did not want to provoke Ottoman hostility, the captain of Shkodër (Scutari) was ordered to assist Hasan Bey in recapturing Dagnum. Arms were subsequently sent to the garrison of Lezhë (Alessio) and by 1435 the fort had been returned to Ottoman control. In central Albania, Andrea Thopia unsuccessfully besieged the castle of Krujë, while in the region of Vlorë the siege of the fort of Kaninë began. Vlorë was lost to the rebels as early as May 1432, but must have been recovered by May 1434 as contemporary Venetian documents mention an Ottoman official (subaşi) stationed there at that time. Another Ottoman army was assembled in Manastir in the summer of 1434. Again under the command of Sinan Pasha, this Ottoman expedition was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti in south- central Albania in August 1434. After his defeat, all beys of the territories bordering Albania were ordered to gather their forces and attack the rebels. In December 1434 Ishak Bey, sanjakbey of Üsküb marched into south-central Albania but was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti. Contemporary sources from the senate of Ragusa mention that many Ottoman soldiers were captured, while Ishak Bey escaped with a small group. In April 1435, Arianiti defeated another Ottoman campaign and hostilities virtually ceased until the beginning of 1436, as Murat II's military efforts were focused against Ibrahim of Karaman in Anatolia. At the end of 1435 reports of the Ragusan senate assessed the situation as calm and noted that the belligerents had retreated to their respective territories. During the revolt many attempts were made to form an anti-Ottoman coalition including the Holy Roman Empire. Pope Eugene IV requested troops to be sent to assist the revolt and tried to gather funds. In 1435, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg sent Fruzhin, a Bulgarian nobleman, and in early 1436 Daud, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, to negotiate the possibility of a coalition with the rebels. However, by mid-1436 a large force under Turahan Bey had been assembled. Despite the military victories the rebel leaders acted autonomously without a central leadership, the lack of which contributed greatly to their final defeat. Turahan's forces eventually subdued the revolt and marched through Albania, committing widespread massacres of civilians.  Aftermath  alt=Skanderbeg, Albanian national hero and most important leader of the Ottoman-Albanian wars In order to stabilize Ottoman authority, Murat II appointed native Albanians like Yakup Bey Muzaka and Skanderbeg to high positions within the sanjak of Albania. The nobles who accepted Ottoman overlordship were granted their pre-Ottoman holdings and border estates as well as a degree of autonomy, while others were exiled or continued warring. In 1436–37, rebels were active in the regions of Gjirokastër and Vlorë and Theodor Corona Musachi led a revolt in the region of Berat. As many rebels used Venetian territories like Shkodër and Parga as bases to launch raids into Ottoman territory, representatives of Mehmed II asked the Venetians to outlaw their activity in October 1436. As Ottoman rule in the Balkans expanded, Albanian timar holders and officials were once again replaced with Anatolian ones. The status quo ante bellum policies of the Ottomans gradually led to the formation of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444 and the beginning of a new era in the Ottoman-Albanian wars.

W.\\" Sheldon (c. 1842 - January 31, 1884) was an American jurist who served as Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court from 1883 till his death in 1884. Background Sheldon was born in Granville, Ohio, to Paul Warner Sheldon Jr. and his second wife, Eliza (Howell) Sheldon, in either 1842 or early 1843. He was educated in local public schools and attended Denison University. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Sheldon enlisted as a private for three months in the 17th Ohio Infantry. After the completion of his initial enlistment, he joined the 45th Ohio Infantry. Sheldon was commissioned as a captain on October 13, 1864. Sheldon spent the remainder of the war as a staff officer for a number of commanding officers, \\"having been severely wounded in battle and incapacitated for active field service\\". At the end of hostilities he was assigned to Richmond, Virginia, as Commissary of Subsistence of Virginia. Sheldon achieved the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on March 13, 1865, and left the military on March 20, 1866. Following the war, Sheldon moved to New York City, where he studied law. On his application for the Arizona bench he indicated that he had graduated from the \\"Columbia College Law School\\", though the Columbia University records do not list him as having received a degree. By 1875 Sheldon had been admitted to the bar and was practicing law at the firm of Lockwood, Sheldon & Lockwood. While in New York, Sheldon served as Judge Advocate for the New York State Militia, participated in veteran's organizations, and was an attorney for the Prison Association of New York. By 1880, problems from his war wounds became bad enough that he sought relief by moving south in hope of a more beneficial climate. To assist him in these efforts, Sheldon's friends found him a job as editor of the Sunday Baltimore Herald. While in Baltimore, Sheldon was recommended by William Pinkney Whyte for judicial appointment. This recommendation was then endorsed by Ulysses S. Grant, Roscoe Conkling, and prominent members of the New York and Baltimore legal profession. In the recommendation, Sheldon's friends noted he had \\"lately been addicted\\" to the newspaper business and wished to leave it. President Chester A. Arthur nominated Sheldon to replace Wilson W. Hoover as Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on March 30, 1883. At the time of the appointment, Sheldon's physicians were recommending he undergo surgery in New York before traveling to Arizona. Sheldon was concerned about the expected recovery time and instead chose to leave for the territory immediately, arriving to take his oath of office on May 15, 1883. Upon his arrival, he settled in Tucson, Arizona Territory and was assigned to Graham, Pima, and Pinal counties. In September 1883, Sheldon traveled to San Francisco, California and underwent a series of three operations to his hip and thigh. On November 5, 1883, Sheldon presided over Graham county's first district court session. This was followed on January 7, 1884, by his joining with Chief Justice C. G. W. French and Justice Daniel H. Pinney for a session of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. While court records indicate that Sheldon \\"rendering decision\\" on several cases, the only surviving decision is a concurrence with Justice Pinney's decision in Dawson v. Lail, (1884) 1 Arizona 490. Following the Supreme Court session, Sheldon traveled to San Francisco for additional medical treatment. While there he died on January 31, 1884, in the Palace Hotel. There he was provided a funeral by a local veteran's association.

Life He was born into an Armenian family in Gyumri. He Studied at Yerevan Fine Art College after Panos Terlemezyan. He has participated in different international exhibitions. His paintings can be found in Armenian National Gallery, \\"Modern Art\\" Museum in Washington, \\"Richard Manukean\\" Gallery in Detroit, \\"Arshil Gorki\\" and \\"Gallery Drown\\" in Paris, \\"Zimerlin\\" museum of modern arts in New Jersey, and in private collections in various countries. Videos taken from several sources Abstract Castle In The Air by Karen Smbatyan, 1994 Throughout his earthly life the diverse and multidimensional artist Karen Smbatyan had to struggle and fight for his internal freedom and external liberty. As a person and citizen he intrinsically chose the path of veracity and truth. He acted with infinite honesty and stepped through life with pride and honour. The destiny of the Armenian people and his national identity have always been equally dominant and imperative as his quest for the hidden mystery of artistic creativity. The brief of his biography reveals that the artist was born in 1932 in Gyumri. He studied at P. Terlemezyan College, however later he had to quit his studies to join the Soviet army (Estonia, Doko island). While serving in the army he still continues to work and create and his works tracing back to that period have been highly appreciate within professional circles. His artistic biography dating back to the late 50s and early 60s was characterized by Karen's search for lively, everlasting, authentic perceptions of objects through nature, life and human manifestations, adhering to animated means and forms of high realism (\\"Makuyk\\" 1954, \\"The sailor Nikolay Blokhin\\", 1954, \\"Ian Paulianki\\", 1959, portraits). During 1966-80 he was the editor Of \\"Pioner\\" and \\"Tsitsarnak\\" children's periodicals. During that period he created the illustrations of \\"Jelsomino in The Land of Cheaters\\" and \\"Jan Polat\\" folktales by Gianni Rodari and authored the images of the periodicals with demonstrating a new fresh approach in the field. Parallel to that he was very sensitive about self-education and paid a special attention to the study and research of the roots of Armenian stylistic school spending hours in the Matenadaran exploring Armenian miniature hardly concealing his admiration and fascination by the genius of art. (Grigor Tatevaci, Toros Taronatsi). His diary notes dating back to 1970s reveal that he was particularly concerned with his explorations of problems of color and form, their unimpeded interpretation, the free flow of mind and emotions have become direction of art and artistic belief that transmits expressive means and sacred monumental sonority. The insight contemplations open up inner self and metaphysical thinking of the artist for the viewer (\\"Shell\\" 1975, \\"Amulet\\", 1977, \\"Indian jug\\" 1975). Having sound and deep understanding and perception of the coloristic achievements of Armenian artists (M. Saryan, H. Kalenc, Minas) Karen makes the color surface of the picture so intensive that it turns into fireworks, spiritual soaring, burning sunset. \\"The Art is feast of colors,\\" he cites the idea of Delacroix which means that it is not the plot that should dominate the picture. This refers to all genres as well as to free compositions (\\"Varuzhan Vardanyan\\", 1983 \\"The portrait of Mshetsi\\", 1989, \\"The Garden\\", 1994, \\"Autumn\\", 1999). This powerful rise of this manifestation of his creativity is an ode to the love for the nature, philanthropy. In the picture the leitmotif is the light, the solar warmth is \\"the peace of soul\\". (\\"The quay. Sevan\\", 2003, \\"Noonday\\", 2005, \\"Northern sun\\", 2006). The simplicity of composition the completeness of the style, the seeming lack of attention for detail have been the most attractive elements of the last two decades, which allowed the artist to achieve monumental sonority. From point of view \\"The most luxurious luxury is simplicity\\" or \\"The painting is complete only when the unnecessary things ara removed\\". Quotes Penetrating and tens, especially by inner clairvoyance characteristic of an individual, he has discovered and reveled- within himself, not from the outside. Other architonic coatings, achieving an apocryphal level where the artist exposes spirited characters and objects, vital in everyone, both indigenous and common to all mankind. Only big artists can see them and show them. On the other hand the inner world is resuscitated and made viable by the robust power of potential individuality, represented as a whole image due to the brilliance and energy of an artist named Karen Smbatyan, who has acquired the gifts of nature so abundantly.

In the second half of the 19th century, there were 191 houses and 1285 inhabitants (698 Ukrainian Greek-Catholics, 587 mainly Polish (some Ukrainian) Roman Catholics, 12 Germans, 17 Jews and a few Armenians) in the village. Zavaliv had a stone-built Polish Roman Catholic church and Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker. The history of intelligent, highly cultured family of Dmytro Huzar (1823–1908) is extremely interesting. He was the pastor of the village Zavaliv and now rests in peace on the village's cemetery, together with his beloved wife. Lubomyr Husar is his great-grandson. Dmytro Huzar arrived to Zavaliv in 1856. Served there in the parish until 1908. At the moment of arrival he already had two sons, Volodymyr and Yevhen. His son Lev (grandfather of Lubomyr Husar) and daughter Olha (in future - writer, translator, wife of Volodymyr Levytskyi) were born in Zavaliv. His Eminent Beatitude Lubomyr Husar visited Zavaliv and prayed for his relatives in the cemetery.http://h.ua/story/439811 Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko visited the village during the Easter holiday of 1883 and a month later, he wrote an article about two remarkable icons of local St. Nicholas church.

He helped in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Black Panther project in Lowndes County, Alabama with security and self-defense against the Ku Klux Klan. He asked Stokely Carmichael if he could use the Panther name and idea to try to spread it. Carmichael told him it belonged to \\"the people and he should feel free to use it.\\" With permission, he returned to Oakland and started his own Black Panther project in 1965 called the Oakland Direct Action Committee (ODAC) and was its head. He later found that other local groups liked the Black Panther name as well. He also started clubs for young black males called the Alm Boy Dukes and the Enchanted Maffions. Mark Comfort married a white woman, Gloria Black (Oakland, California, July 16, 1937 – Klamath Falls, Oregon, October 11, 2010), on March 27, 1953, in Oakland. Mark's wife was once blocked from entering a Black Panther Party (BPP) office by a Panther member. Bobby Seale, BPP co-founder, told that member, \\"Are you stupid? Let her into that office.\\" Seale felt that If Mark was a Panther, so was his wife. It didn't matter what race she was. In 1966, the Parents Association for Better Schools was formed by Mark, his wife Gloria and members of the ODAC to press for free school lunches for needy children in the Oakland Public Schools. This project was successful, and later became the Ad Hoc Committee for Better Schools, which then worked with the Oakland School District in an effort to improve the quality of education offered to all children in the district. In 1966, Mark Comfort was a candidate for the State Assembly and finished 4th in a field of nine in a campaign run almost entirely without funds. The ODAC and BPP worked together and would follow police after blacks were arrested and follow them to the police station and would often bail them out as well. In 1967, a black man, Denzil Dowell, was shot by a Contra Costa County sheriff's deputy. A grand jury ruled the killing a \\"justifiable homicide\\". The police claimed to have shot Dowell three times, but a coroner's report noted that he bled to death after being shot ten times. The family was not allowed to see the body nor to take possession of his clothing to determine how many times he had actually been shot. When Mark contacted Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, they accepted the request for assistance. The media coverage over this gave the Black Panther Party exposure into homes of millions of Americans. In spring 1967, Comfort, as the head of the ODAC, joined the BPP in a so-called \\"invasion\\" of the California Assembly in Sacramento. The BPP borrowed 7 of Mark's guns for the raid. At Bobby Seale's request, Mark Comfort was the last person to surrender his weapon. Upon arriving at the Assembly, the 33rd California Governor, Ronald Reagan, was speaking on the lawn to a couple hundred \\"future leaders\\" when he spotted the group of angry looking blacks approaching, and quickly left. Followed by the media they entered the assembly chambers and read \\"Executive Mandate Number One\\" written by Huey Newton, who was not present because he was on parole. The Mandate read: > The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense calls upon the American people in > general and the Black People in particular to take careful note of the > racist California Legislature now considering legislation aiming at keeping > black people disarmed and powerless at the very time that racist police > agencies throughout the country intensify the terror, brutality, murder and > repression of Black People. As the aggression of the racist American > Government escalates in Vietnam, the police agencies of America escalate the > repression of Black People throughout the ghettos of America. Vicious police > dogs, cattle prods, and increased patrols have become familiar sights in > Black communities ... The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense believes that > the time has come for Black people to arm themselves against this terror > before it's too late. The group surrendered their weapons and were arrested. At Bobby Seale's request, Mark Comfort was the last person to surrender his weapon. Seale was charged with possession of a concealed weapon and the others were detained under an obscure law that made it illegal to disrupt state assembly proceedings. This event brought the group into the national spotlight turning the group into a national phenomenon. This sparked interest in the BPP increasing membership across the nation. In July 1967, after the raid, the assembly passed the Mulford Act prohibiting the public carrying of loaded firearms. This forced the BPP to disarm and disband its \\"police patrols\\". Mark Comfort was also arrested in 1967 along with Newton and Seale following a picket of The Oakland Tribune. They and members of their party were arrested on a Sacramento street for \\"being a public nuisance.\\" They were defended by Beverly Axelrod, a Sacramento attorney. Comfort was sentenced to six months in jail and served only 44 days in the Santa Rita Prison Farm after Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas gave him a stay of sentence.

Lviv, 1992 The Masoch Fund is a Ukrainian art association founded in 1991 in Lviv by Roman Viktyuk, Ihor Podolchak and Ihor Dyurych. Its artistic practice is connected with the tradition of European actionism and Nicolas Bourriaud’s “relational aesthetics”. The Fund is named after Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, which makes a reference to the marginal fields of culture and society and also underlines the locality (Sacher-Masoch was born in Lviv). The ideological principle of the Masoch Fund is “Aesthetics contra Ethics”.Возняк, Т.

The Masoch Fund focuses on the social, political and economic context of the Ukrainian society. Unlike other action artists whose work often refers to personal experience (Marina Abramović) or mysterial impermeability (Viennese Actionists), the Masoch Fund emphasizes the active role of its audience. It can be best compared to the work of Slovenian artists’ collective IRWIN, Danish artists’ group Superflex and the tandem of Svetlana Heger and Plamen Dejanov. In 2006–2010, the Masoch Fund included a subsidiary production company MF Films that produced the films Las Meninas and Delirium.  Selected works  = Art in Space (1993) = Ihor Podolchak's solo exhibition. Space station Mir, 1993 The project involved two stages. The first stage was a personal exhibition of Ihor Podolchak in the outer space. The exhibition took place on board of the space station Mir on January 25, 1993. The project was documented on videoYouTube - Art In Space Ihor Podolchak 1993 (5 minutes). The exhibited objects included Untitled (1990), The Look Through (1991). The third engraving that was planned to be exhibited was dismissed by a doctor from the mission control center due to its explicit erotic content. The second stage involved sending Podolchak's artbook Jakob Böhme to the space station and its subsequent putting into orbit. According to the authors’ conception, the book on orbit would become the first \\"ARTificial\\" satellite of the Earth. Technical problems at the space station Mir in the late 1990s prevented this part of the project from being realized. Art in Space project brings up the problem of existence of a work of art outside the cultural context and, to some extent, calls out to revise the evaluation criteria for art. = Mausoleum for the President (1994) = Mausoleum for the President. Art object, 1994 The work consisted of a jar with lard and pork rinds, an electric hot plate and a photo of the first President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk placed in lard. When the hot plate was on, lard in the jar melted, becoming transparent and revealing the preserved (mummified) image of the President.Соловьев, А.; Ложкина, А. История украинского современного искусства: середина 90-х www.artinua.com, Retrieved December 3, 2011 Mausoleum for the President was completed before the presidential election. It summarized the \\"romantic\\" period of the modern history of Ukraine – acquiring independence. The project proclaimed liberation of Ukrainian people from mental constraints which prevented them from gaining real independence. The topic of mausoleum was a provocation that implied historical parallels and political speculations. The work represented a search for the national recipe of mummification (lard and pork rinds are Ukrainian \\"totemic accessories\\"). = Climax (1994) = The project was presented by Ihor Podolchak and Ihor Dyurych to George Soros during his meeting with Ukrainian artists. Soros was suggested to build a 40 meters high ice pyramid superstructure over Mount Everest. As a result, the highest peak on the Earth would reach symbolic 8,888 meters – four infinity symbols that would represent humanistic aspirations of the mankind. However, Soros humorously refused to participate in the project. = Happy Victory Day, Mr. Muller! (1995) = () On May 8, 1995, on the anniversary date of the end of World War II on the Eastern Front, 5500 Müllers (bearers of the most common and emblematic German surname) who lived in Berlin received greetings from the Masoch Fund saying “Happy Victory Day!”. The greeting card featured the image of 1945 Reichstag with a red flag and Christo and Jeanne-Claude's 1995 wrapped Reichstag as a supermarket product – the symbols of the beginning and the end of the 50-year- long post-war history. The project deconstructed the image of “winners and losers” in World War II. In 1995, Germany was an economically and politically powerful state, while the Soviet Union that had seemingly won the war already ceased to exist. = The Last Jewish Pogrom (1995) = The Last Jewish Pogrom. Art object, 1995 The Last Jewish Pogrom was announced not as an art project but as a real event. Each spectator had to become a participant and choose the role of either the victim or the pogrom-maker. “Victims” were numbered and bonded to comply with the rules on the “pogrom territory” (not to leave the room, not to consume alcohol, etc.), and “pogrom makers” received a shot of vodka at the entrance. Most participants chose the roles of victims. The actual pogrom did not happen. The Masoch Fund organized an auction, and the “pogrom makers” became “schindlers” (the myth of Oskar Schindler) and ransomed the “victims”. The action raised the problem of responsibility of choice and safety of artistic space. = The Last Concert Tour in Ukraine (2000) = On the day when Bill Clinton was giving a speech in Kiev, the Masoch Fund stuck around posters “The Last Concert Tour in Ukraine” featuring the American President playing sax.Фото УНІАН.

Faria Jr. (born 30 September 1952) is an associate editor-in-chief in socioeconomics, politics, medicine, and world affairs of Surgical Neurology International from 2012–present, before that a member of the Editorial Board of Surgical Neurology from 2004 to 2010. He is a retired neurosurgeon and neuroscientist,Faria MA Jr, Tindall GT. Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and surgical treatment of the Chiari Malformation. Contemporary Neurosurgery 1980 2 (Lesson 9) medical editor and author, medical historian and medical ethicist, public health critic, and advocate for the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Early life and education Faria was born in Sancti Spiritus, Cuba. Faria's parents were members of the urban underground Revolutionary Directorate (Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil; DRE) under Faure Chomón and Rolando Cubela that fought against Fulgencio Batista. Faria (age 13) and his father, also a physician, were prompted to escape from Cuba while under the watch of Cuba's State Security. Their escape through several Caribbean islands is narrated in Faria's book. Faria entered and completed his undergraduate studies at the University of South Carolina, receiving a BS degree (Biology and Psychology) and graduating magna cum laude in 1973. He then attended the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina, and was inducted into Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society (1975) in his second year. Faria graduated with honors, receiving the Merck's Manual Award for scholastic achievement, and earning his M.D. degree in 1977. Faria completed his surgical internship at Shands Teaching Hospital at the University of Florida (1977–1978), and his neurosurgical residency at Emory University (1978–1983). Professional life Faria practiced neurosurgery in Macon, Georgia, at HCA Coliseum Medical Centers, where he served as Chief of staff. Faria was also clinical professor of neurosurgery (ret.) and adjunct professor of medical history (ret.) at Mercer University School of Medicine. Faria has written over 200 medical, scientific, and professional articles as well as letters or editorials published in the medical literature. More than 70 of these articles are currently indexed in PubMed. His specialties range from brain surgery for the removal of cerebral tumors; traumatic blood clots of the brain; diagnosis and treatment of pituitary tumors via microsurgery; diagnosis and treatment of cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations; radiographic techniques; diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of the Chiari type I and II malformations; advances in neurosurgery;Tindall GT, Moore W, Faria MA Jr. Neurosurgery – The Year in Review (1981). Contemporary Neurosurgery. GT Tindall and D. Long, editors. Volume 3, Lesson 27, 1982. to medical history and politics. Faria served on the Injury Research Grant Review Committee (later renamed the Initial Review Group [IRG]) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2002–2005, reviewing grants seeking public funding for scientific and technical merit in the area of injury prevention and control. During the 1990s, Faria was involved in a gun control debate regarding the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC).Hendrick B, Rochell A. CDC defends its research on guns, AIDS – Foes fault violence studies, estimate of non-gay risk. Atlanta Journal Constitution, 12 May 1996, p. 1A, A12-A13.Nesmith J.

A debate on guns and health. Conservative lawmakers: Agency spreads anti-firearm propaganda. Atlanta Journal Constitution, 2 May 1996, A13. Faria felt that the NCIPC's program on gun violence was biased against gun owners, promoting \\"politicized, result-oriented research.\\" In March 1996, Faria testified before the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health, and Human Services to that effect stating, \\"I have yet to see a published report that has been funded by the NCIPC in which the benefits of firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens have been published even though they are there ... if you don't conclude that guns are bad and that they need to be eradicated because they are a 'public health menace,' they are not published.\\" Congress eventually prohibited the CDC from funding gun research and proscribed public health officials from using taxpayer's money in lobbying and participating in politically partisan activities. Humanitarian effort In March 1990, Faria traveled to El Salvador as part of a mission sponsored by the politically conservative Accuracy in Media (AIM). During this trip to El Salvador, Faria visited hospitals and orphanages. After his return to the United States, Faria, who was then serving as chief-of-staff at HCA Coliseum Medical Centers in Macon, Georgia, convinced Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr., CEO of Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), to send humanitarian assistance to El Salvador. As a result of Faria's effort, Salvadoran hospitals received a shipment of medications, beds, wheelchairs and physical therapy equipment. Publications and editorships During 1993–1995, Faria was the editor of the Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia, taking that state medical journal to national prominence and controversy, which resulted in pressure on him to resign.Associated Press.

Editor causes \\"discomfort\\"; pressured to resign. AAPS News, September 1995. In 1996 Faria founded and served as editor-in-chief of the Medical Sentinel of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). As editor of the Medical Sentinel, Faria called for an \\"open data, public review policy in peer reviewed medical journalism.\\" He called for other medical journal editors to post research data online thereby allowing investigators to validate scientific conclusions before public policy is implemented, particularly in the area of public health. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that public policy is dictated by sound scientific principles and not by premature assertions or tainted by politics or ideology. Faria left AAPS in 2002 to pursue other interests. From 2004 to 2010, Faria served on the Editorial Board of Surgical Neurology, an international journal of neurosurgery, formerly the Official International Journal of the Neurosurgical Societies of Belgium, Brazil, China, Romania, Russia, and Taiwan. Surgical Neurology International (SNI), its successor publication, was also headed by James I. Ausman, M.D., editor-in-chief. Faria served with SNI as one of its editors, along with his colleague, Dr. Russell Blaylock. In 2003 Faria published a three part history of surgery article, \\"Violence, Mental Illness, and the Brain – A Brief History of Psychosurgery.\\" In 2015, a raging debate began between Faria and Ezekiel Emanuel on the issue of bioethics and longevity, following the latter's publication of an article stating life was not worth living after age 75 and that longevity was not a worthwhile goal in health care policy. This was denied by Faria, who claimed that life could still be fruitful and rewarding after that age, if healthy lifestyles are led. Faria states that longevity is a worthwhile goal and that the compression of morbidity of James Fries should be upgraded from a hypothesis to a theory. This debate also pits traditional individual-based medical ethicists against the utilitarian perspective of the modern bioethics movement. Faria researched Soviet communism and expounded on the political crimes committed by the Soviet totalitarian regime, particularly those that took place during the Russian Revolution and subsequently by Joseph Stalin. Faria propounded a theory of the political spectrum that depends on the degrees of individual liberty as opposed to government control, redefining the political left to include fascism as well as communism. Faria has also published an intriguing medical history article positing that Stalin's death was due to deliberate poisoning by a cabal of his inner circle, who also delayed medical treatment. His article hinges on the work of previous investigators but is substantiated by clinical reports and autopsy findings, which were published in Pravda contemporaneously but forgotten in the Soviet archives. Faria has also elaborated on Stalin's infamous Doctors Plot, a developing antisemitic plot, which was only just barely aborted by Stalin's death. Faria has written or coauthored several chapters in medical textbooks, and his works are cited and referenced in a number of other books and publications.Bennett JT, DiLorenzo TJ.

History =Norton Camp= Norton Camp is a large hillfort, and shows evidence of occupation from neolithic times. Thought to have been on the boundary between two tribes, it is one of the earliest sites of permanent human occupation within the Taunton area. It was later occupied through the Bronze Age to the Roman occupation of the local area. By the early 18th century, the land around the hill was owned by Norton Manor. Silk mills had occupied the Taunton side of the brook that marked the parish boundary, while in the early 20th century the Norton side had been developed as parkland, or left as farmland. = Second World War = Logistics depot With the outbreak of the Second World War, the British Army were in desperate need of modern logistics facilities, positioned with easy access to the major port and transport facilities, yet away from the major Nazi-Luftwaffe targets. Norton Fitzwarren is on the former Bristol and Exeter Railway mainline, which was operated and then taken over by the GWR in 1890. The station became an important junction station, with access within an hour to: *North: Bristol, Cardiff and Gloucester, then onwards to the industrial Midlands *South: Exeter, and hence to HMNB Devonport *East: Yeovil and the LSWR mainline, onwards to all of the major south coast ports, including Portsmouth and Southampton *West: branch lines to and Resultantly, the station for a relatively small village was quite extensive, having two island platforms creating four platforms. Thanks also to the extensive local silk mills, there were also extensive existing freight handling facilities within the Fairwater Yard, a large regional freight yard located south of the mainline. US Army G50 depot Commissioned by the Royal Army Service Corps after completion as a logistics and distribution depot for them in early 1941, the United States Army took over Norton Manor Camp as part of Operation Bolero in 1942, one of their 18 supplies depots within the United Kingdom. Redesignated Quartermaster General Depot G-50, they equipped it with extensive railway sidings to the north-east of the railway station. Part of the reasoning behind the choice of the depot was that it was one of five within the 18 designated as a US Army Medical Corps supplies depot. Medical supplies were allocated of under cover storage, and a further outside. The US Army also locally developed the 67th General Hospital at Musgrove Park. Both facilities under the control of the US Army Medical Corps came into operation on 1 September 1942. Prisoner of War Camp: No. 665 Cross Keys Nissen huts erected as part of the PoW camp, which later became part of the larger British Army base In 1941, the British Army established a 300-person Prisoner of War (POW) camp on a northern part of the site at Burnshill, designated POW Camp No.665 Cross Keys. Initially housing Italian Army prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign, it later housed German prisoners post the Battle of Normandy. All prisoners stationed there were considered a low security risk, and were offered work within the supplies depot, which came with resultant generous supplies of food and rations, or on the various local farms. The Italians were particularly popular with the local people, often offering sweets and fruit to the local children. The German prisoners were also popular, as they had been vetted and deemed non-Nazis. =Post War Ordnance Depot (1945–1978)= After the end of hostilities, the US Army handed the base back to the British Army. It was decided to retain Norton Manor Camp, and utilise its extensive logistics capability by becoming the Royal Army Ordnance Corps central overseas supplies depot. Re-designated No.3 Supply Reserve Depot, the Army equipped it with a civil workforce, who were charged with sourcing, buying and then packing various supplies packs, mainly ration food but also other supplies, for British Army units stationed around the world across the quickly diminishing British Empire. One of the former supply depot buildingsDespite extensive lobbying by local Member of Parliament Edward du Cann on the Under- Secretary of State for Defence for the Army Merlyn Rees, the decision was made to close the depot in 1966. With the branch-line to also closing under the Beeching Axe, the station at Norton Fitzwarren was closed by British Railways in the same year. However, despite the publicised closure of No.3 Supply Reserve Depot, this was not the end for the ordnance depot. It was renamed 'Southern Command Vehicle & Equipment Pool' and provided vehicles and equipment for various units for training purposes. In the early 1970s, it was renamed 'Training Materiel Park Taunton' (TMP Taunton). It is believed that the TMP closed at the end of 1978. =British Army training base (1950–1983)= The northern part of the camp was separated from the ordnance depot after the war and took the name Norton Manor Camp. From 1950 until 1961, it was home to 8 (Basic Trades) Training Battalion of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) and was responsible for training vehicle mechanics. From the early 1960s to the late 1970s, the base was the main camp of the Junior Leaders Regiment of the Royal Army Service Corps, later Royal Corps of Transport from 1965, vetting and then training boys from age 15 to to be army clerks (till 1965) and transport drivers. From September 1979 to 1983 the camp became the home for the Junior Soldiers Battalion training boy soldiers for all Infantry units, less Guards, and the Royal Corps of Transport. This short lived unit disbanded when the Royal Marines took over the camp. =Royal Marines operational base (1983–present)= In 1983, 40 Royal Marines Commando moved from Seaton Barracks, Plymouth, where they had been based since their return from Singapore in 1971, into Norton Manor Camp, which became the base for an operational unit for the first time in its history. =Redevelopment= After the decision to move the Royal Corps of Transport and their Junior Leader training base to Colerne in Wiltshire, the base size was rationalised. A separate Norton Manor Camp was established on the northern part of the site, including the former POW camp, with a secure fence and facilities. The western part of the site close to the railway was sold off to either commercial developers (including a new production site for Taunton Blackthorn Cider), re-utilised as a trading estate, or sold onwards to Taunton Deane Borough Council for redevelopment as housing. By the early 21st century, agreement was reached to redevelop the site again. Only four of the original Army supply depot warehouses now survive, with the rest demolished to build a new trading estate, 500 new homes, and a new road system to bypass Norton Fitzwarren.  Based units  Notable units based at Norton Manor Camp. = Royal Navy = Royal Marines (3 Commando Brigade) *40 Commando Role and operations Royal Marines of 40 Commando firing a FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile. With easy access to the ideal combined training territory contained within the Blackdown and Quantock Hills, as well as the Somerset Levels, from 1983 the camp has been home to 40 Commando, Royal Marines. The base is fully supporting of the Marines and their families, providing a range of accommodation suites and houses; a medical centre; dental surgery; education centre; library; internet suite; RI shop; Naafi/Spar shop and families centre. School-aged children are provided with complementary transport to educated within local state schools. Refreshed and in part rebuilt, the camp includes extensive fitness and gymnasium facilities, with: a large fully equipped gymnasium; separate indoor arena for football and basketball; indoor swimming pool and squash and tennis courts. Outside is a climbing tower; an all-weather pitch; individual pitches for both football and rugby; and a camp perimeter circuit track. =Shoulder to Shoulder= In 2010, the Somerset County Gazette launched the \\"Shoulder to Shoulder\\" campaign, allowing local people to directly support 40 Commando. The campaign received backing from the UK Government, and from Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt and former Taunton Deane MP and fellow Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne.  Future  In 2016, the government announced that Norton Manor Camp would be closed by 2028. However, following a successful campaign by Taunton Deane MP Rebecca Pow and Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate Gideon Amos, it was announced in February 2019 that the decision to close Norton Manor Camp had been reversed and the camp would remain operational indefinitely. https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/17465473.closure-of-norton-manor- camp-near-taunton-reversed/ References Buildings and structures in Taunton Deane Royal Navy bases in England World War II prisoner of war camps in England Royal Marines bases Military history of Somerset Norton Fitzwarren ","title":"Norton Manor Camp"},{"id":"36601050","text":"Giulia Rondon (born 16 October 1987, Pisa) is an Italian professional volleyball player.

Background Shaw was born and raised in Toronto. Her parents were both prominent lawyers, and her mother was the Dean of Osgoode Hall Law School. As a child, she took piano, guitar, and voice lessons. She attended Branksome Hall, an academically rigorous, International Baccalaureate high school in downtown Toronto. She went on to study opera and theatre arts at Queen's University in Kingston. Career Meredith got her big break when Gordie Johnson of the band Big Sugar heard her singing and took her under his wing. Soon, it was agreed that Johnson would produce Shaw's debut album. He took her down to Willie Nelson's Pedernales studio in Spicewood, Texas to record. In 2011, Shaw was hired by Boom 97.3, a radio station in Toronto. During her time at Boom as a weekend host, she interviewed artists, ranging from Serena Ryder and The Spoons to Gordie Johnson and JD Fortune (INXS). She has introduced concerts by The Beach Boys, Platinum Blonde, and Anjulie. In November 2014, Meredith moved up the dial from Boom 97.3 to her new radio home, CHUM-FM. She can be heard weekdays from 4 pm to 7 pm, and on Sundays 10AM-Noon for The Back in the Day Brunch. Meredith also hosted a weekly video series with CHUM-FM's afternoon host Ashley Greco titled This Is So My Jam on CHUM-FM's website. Every Wednesday, the two picked their favourite jams and battled it out with viewers of the show deciding who took top jam supremacy. After 3 seasons and 10 episodes, This Is So My Jam was cancelled with the final episode released on Wednesday, June 15, 2016. Recordings =Albums= Her debut album, Place Called Happy, was released in 2011. Gordie Johnson took Shaw on tour with his band Big Sugar that same year. Every night of the tour, Johnson brought Shaw on stage for a mash-up of her single \\"Acted Badly\\" and Big Sugar's \\"Turn The Lights On.\\" The last song on Place Called Happy is called \\" Girls Who Believe,\\" and it is a song that has taken on a life of its own subsequent to the album's release. It was featured in an episode of the TV show Degrassi: The Next Generation and has spawned a community-based initiative called Girls Who Believe, spearheaded by Shaw, which began in 2012 as a series of workshops for girls aged 11 to 17 that ranged in topics from music and creativity to self-esteem. Shaw, along with sponsor Slaight Music, has created the now annual \\"Girls Who Believe Fest\\" featuring an all-female lineup (the 2013 fest included Meredith Shaw, Molly Thomas, and Ladies of the Canyon), female media personalities, and female-run businesses showcased in an onsite marketplace. The funds raised from the fest go towards the non-profit organization Girls Inc. =EPs= Trouble was released in May 2013. It is the first of a planned series of three three-song EPs, which Shaw has deemed \\"tringles.\\" The EPs will each feature guest artists and producers. Trouble was produced by Joel Plaskett; John-Angus MacDonald, of The Trews is lined up for the second one. Shaw has decided it makes more sense for her musically right now to aim for a series of shorter, more regular releases rather than having to wait a longer time to put together a full album. Many of her newer songs, she has said, were inspired by experiences she's had since recording her first album, including all the touring she did with Big Sugar. The second EP is called Hardest Goodbye and will be released on March 4, 2014. Non-musical activities In 2007, Shaw founded the Toronto-based company Muffymade, which sells greeting cards, notepads, chocolates, mugs, and apparel. In 2012, she was signed to the Ben Barry Agency in Toronto. She has modeled in campaigns including Spanner and Walmart and has participated in Toronto Fashion Week. She is also frequently seen on Canadian television, appearing regularly on CBC's Steven and Chris, CTV's The Marilyn Denis Show, and CityTV's Cityline.

After a hiatus while he managed a recording studio, he performed again in the 1980s until his death. He performed as a soloist and as a member of international ensembles. He worked as a studio musician for radio, film, and television. In the 1950s, Leighton founded JAC Recording, a small recording studio in his apartment in Manhattan. Several years later, the studio hired record producer Phil Ramone, who was mentored by Leighton and other audio engineers. Ramone attributes his love of engineering to Leighton.  Career  Charles Leighton, a native New Yorker, taught himself to play the harmonica at the age of twelve. At age sixteen (1937), he toured the U.S., playing lead harmonica in vaudeville theaters with harmonica groups such as the Philharmonicas and the Cappy Barra Harmonica Gentlemen. During the early 1940s, he worked in Hollywood, both in the studio and on screen, appearing in motion pictures for Columbia and RKO. He played country music on the radio with the Hollywood Barn Dance and The Hoagy Carmichael Show. He recorded with the Andrews Sisters, Johnny Bond, Merle Travis, and the Riders of the Purple Sage. Leighton served in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II. After the war, he returned to New York and signed with USO Camp Shows and toured throughout Japan, Korea, and China, entertaining the military. While in the Coast Guard, he formed a trio with Harry Halicki and Joe Pittello. They toured after the war in the show Tars and Spars. They performed with Henry Morgan, Paul Whiteman, and Kay Kyser. After touring with the USO, Leighton returned to New York City to work as a studio musician, playing on radio and television commercials and recording with Harry Belafonte, Hugh Downs, Clint Eastwood, Andre Kostelanetz, Dean Martin, Mitch Miller, Dinah Shore, and Dionne Warwick. In the 1950s Leighton co-founded and operated JAC Recording, Inc., a recording studio, and abandoned performing. Years later a friend asked him to practice and record a harmonica transcription of a flute solo called \\"Poem\\" by Charles Griffes. Never having heard the piece and underestimating its difficulty, Leighton agreed to do it. He produced a studio recording, which motivated him to record a classical music album.

He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, one of the original members of the Roxburghe Club, a member of the Athenaeum Club, Camden Society and Royal Society of Arts, Recorder of Chichester and a Trustee of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club. He went on to become one of the Six Clerks in Chancery, a position which he kept until his retirement on the abolition of the post in 1842, and also founded the Beldornie Press.\\"Utterson, Edward Vernon\\", British Armorial Bindings, University of Toronto, accessed 1 August 2012 Biography Born in 1775 or 1776 as the first of John Utterson of Fareham, Hampshire (who was the secretary of Sir Edward Vernon) and his wife Elizabeth's ( Elizabeth Rowe) eight children, he was baptised on 14 July 1777 at Holy Trinity church, Gosport. He was educated at Eton College, entered Trinity College, Cambridge on 17 February 1794, and Lincoln's Inn on 31 October 1794. He matriculated from Trinity College in Michaelmas term 1797 and was admitted pensioner on 17 February 1798, graduating Bachelor of Laws in 1801, and being called to the bar as a barrister on 1 February 1802.Utterson family tree, Webrarian He married Sarah Elizabeth Brown (1781–1851), daughter of the banker and radical Timothy Brown, on 2 May 1803; she translated Tales of the Dead in 1813, and together they had several children. He practised in the Court of Chancery and was appointed to be one of the Six Clerks in Chancery in 1815, which post he retained until it was abolished in 1842, whereupon he retired, retaining his full salary. He was appointed Recorder of Chichester in 1817, where his father had been portreeve, and he had been made customer for £12 1s in 1800; he appointed William Johnson of Chichester as his deputy, and continued in the post until he resigned in 1820, at which time the council made a resolution that \\"At this Assembly this Body entertain a Deep Sense of the Ability, Zeal and impartiality with which Edward Vernon Utterson Esquire has discharged his important Duties as Recorder ... and they feel the most unfeigned regret that Circumstances have compelled him to Resign ...\\" Politically, he was \\"an uncompromising Tory of the old school, and a most implacable enemy of the system of 'retrenchment' which followed in the wake of the passing of the Reform Bill\\". Utterson lived at 1 Elm Court, Temple, and 19 Great Ormond Street while a member of the Royal Society of Arts from 1805 to 1806, then 32 Great Coram Street, Brunswick Square, London by 1811, and 32 York Terrace, Regent's Park by 1829, but from about 1835 he resided first at Newport, Isle of Wight, before moving to Ryde, living first at Buckland Grange (which before his time was a farm called Ryde House; this name was transferred to a new house built nearer the sea by George Player), and then building Beldornie Tower, Pelham Field, where he set up the Beldornie Press in 1840. When Edward Dawes was elected Member of Parliament for the Isle of Wight in May 1851 on the principles of free trade, Utterson \\"took such umbrage that he removed from Ryde\\", though he and his wife had been registered as living at 16 Suffolk Street, St Martins in the Fields, London, during the 1851 Census, held two months before. His wife died on 22 September 1851, and after this he held the first sale of his library, from 19 to 27 April 1852. Utterson himself died aged 80 on 14 July 1856 at Upper Brunswick Place, Hove, Brighton, and was buried at Fareham. There are memorial tablets in St Thomas's Church, Ryde, to him and his wife. Leisure Edward Utterson's collector's mark =Collector= Like his father, Utterson was a collector of books, drawings and prints, and has been described as \\"a book-collector of real importance and high rank. He had taste, knowledge and experience\\".Quaritch, Bernard and Burbidge, Edward, Contributions Towards a Dictionary of English Book Collectors It is believed that he must have started his collection early in the 19th century, and he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1807. He was one of the eighteen members who founded the Roxburghe Club at dinner at the St. Albans Tavern, St Albans Street, London, on 17 June 1812, which he remained a member of until his death in 1856.British Museum – Term details: Edward UttersonThe Roxburghe Club – Member 17 He edited a number of books from 1812 to 1839, and then founded his own press, Beldornie Press, publishing a number of notable reprints from 1840–1843. These books were printed in very limited numbers, of no more than about twelve to twenty, each copy numbered in print or handwriting. Utterson presented a copy of all of these to John Payne Collier on discovering the interest he had in early English literature. Collier discovered a number of inconsistencies in the books, which he attributed primarily to the scribes and compositors employed by Utterson for Beldornie Press, and published a note to that effect in the 5 January 1856 issue of Notes and Queries, assuming Utterson to be dead. Utterson quickly wrote to him in person, informing him that he was alive and well, and Collier wrote a second note in the next issue, apologising for the confusion. His warning over the accuracy of the Beldornie Press reprints, however, still stands.Oxford DNB article: Utterson, Edward Vernon, subscription only =Artist= Utterson was also a talented amateur artist, and many of his works remain in the British Museum to this day.British Museum archives =Yachtsman= Utterson owned the yacht Iris of Ryde, and was elected a member of the English division of the Royal Western Yacht Squadron in Portsmouth on 27 October 1835. He was also made a Trustee of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club in Ryde, Isle of Wight. Sales As a notable collector, sales of Utterson's books, prints and so on were well advertised events at the time. The first sale of his books was during his lifetime, probably induced by ill health. It ran for eight days from 19 to 27 April 1852, auctioned by S.L. Sotheby & J. Wilkinson, realising £4805, and was followed by the auction of his collection of drawings and engravings. The second sale of his book collection ran for seven days, from 20 to 27 March 1857, eight months after his death, and amounted to £4050. Bibliography =Works edited= *Virgilius.

So it was, when Pope Innocent X was elected at the papal conclave of 1644, that Vidman was relieved of his positions to allow the new pope to sell them to prospective young clerks. Vidman, then, was elevated to cardinal in the consistory of 7 October 1647 by Pope Innocent X and was installed as cardinal- deacon at the Church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. Despite his elevation to cardinal, he and his brother, now a count, still delighted, \\"in gaming, feasting, comedies, and the company of women\\".

The order of a bramble is the smallest size of a hitting set, a set of vertices of G that has a nonempty intersection with each of the subgraphs. Brambles may be used to characterize the treewidth of G.. In this reference, brambles are called \\"screens\\" and their order is called \\"thickness\\". Treewidth and havens A haven of order k in a graph G is a function β that maps each set X of fewer than k vertices to a connected component of G − X, in such a way that every two subsets β(X) and β(Y) touch each other. Thus, the set of images of β forms a bramble in G, with order k. Conversely, every bramble may be used to determine a haven: for each set X of size smaller than the order of the bramble, there is a unique connected component β(X) that contains all of the subgraphs in the bramble that are disjoint from X. As Seymour and Thomas showed, the order of a bramble (or equivalently, of a haven) characterizes treewidth: a graph has a bramble of order k if and only if it has treewidth at least . Size of brambles Expander graphs of bounded degree have treewidth proportional to their number of vertices, and therefore also have brambles of linear order. However, as Martin Grohe and Dániel Marx showed, for these graphs, a bramble of such a high order must include exponentially many sets. More strongly, for these graphs, even brambles whose order is slightly larger than the square root of the treewidth must have exponential size. However, Grohe and Marx also showed that every graph of treewidth k has a bramble of polynomial size and of order \\\\Omega(k^{1/2}/\\\\log^2 k).. Computational complexity Because brambles may have exponential size, it is not always possible to construct them in polynomial time for graphs of unbounded treewidth. However, when the treewidth is bounded, a polynomial time construction is possible: it is possible to find a bramble of order k, when one exists, in time O(nk + 2) where n is the number of vertices in the given graph. Even faster algorithms are possible for graphs with few minimal separators.. Bodlaender, Grigoriev, and Koster. studied heuristics for finding brambles of high order. Their methods do not always generate brambles of order close to the treewidth of the input graph, but for planar graphs they give a constant approximation ratio. Kreutzer and Tazari. provide randomized algorithms that, on graphs of treewidth k, find brambles of polynomial size and of order \\\\Omega(k^{1/2}/\\\\log^3 k) within polynomial time, coming within a logarithmic factor of the order shown by to exist for polynomial size brambles. Directed brambles The concept of bramble has also been defined for directed graphs. In a directed graph D, a bramble is a collection of strongly connected subgraphs of D that all touch each other: for every pair of disjoint elements X, Y of the bramble, there must exist an arc in D from X to Y and one from Y to X. The order of a bramble is the smallest size of a hitting set, a set of vertices of D that has a nonempty intersection with each of the elements of the bramble. The bramble number of D is the maximum order of a bramble in D. The bramble number of a directed graph is within a constant factor of its directed treewidth.

It was a diplomatic mission representing Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia), initially as a self-governing colony of Britain and, after the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in November 1965, as an unrecognised state. Rhodesia informed Britain of its intent to open a Lisbon mission headed by an accredited representative, independent from the British Embassy in the city, in June 1965. Whitehall refused to endorse the idea but Rhodesia continued nonetheless, and later that month appointed Harry Reedman to head the mission. The British government attempted unsuccessfully to block this unilateral act—Rhodesia's first—for some months afterwards. The affair came amid the larger dispute between Whitehall and Salisbury regarding the terms under which Rhodesia could be granted sovereign independence. Rhodesia's mostly white government insisted that statehood should come under the constitution introduced with Britain's approval in 1961, while Whitehall insisted that a set timetable for the introduction of black majority rule would have to be in place before the country could be fully independent. The Rhodesian government's stance on this matter caused it to become isolated within the Commonwealth, which from 1964 excluded it from most of its internal bodies, while the Rhodesian military became unofficially embargoed by its established British and American suppliers. Rhodesia had run itself as a self- governing colony since 1923, but ultimate responsibility for foreign affairs remained with Britain. Rhodesia's staunch opposition to immediate black rule and its disillusionment regarding Britain propelled it towards Portugal, which governed Angola and Mozambique, territories respectively to the west and east of Rhodesia. In their attempt to prove that an independent Lisbon mission was legal, the Rhodesians presented an argument based on British legislation conferring on the colonial government the right to appoint its own \\"diplomatic agents, or consular or trade representatives, in countries which are willing to receive them\\". The British countered that ultimate purview over Rhodesian foreign affairs still lay with Whitehall. They proposed that Reedman be integrated into the British Embassy in Lisbon as a Rhodesian consul, but Rhodesia refused to accept a lesser post for Reedman than those enjoyed by the independent Rhodesian representatives in South Africa and Mozambique. Following months of abortive Anglo-Rhodesian talks and unsuccessful attempts by Britain to deter Portugal diplomatically, Reedman travelled to Lisbon in September 1965 to take up his post at the head of an independent Rhodesian mission. The Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which insisted it was neutral regarding Rhodesia, outraged Whitehall by accepting Reedman's letter of accreditation—though Lisbon was careful to avoid provoking Britain, omitting the word \\"diplomatic\\" from the titles given to both Reedman and his mission. The Rhodesians still regarded themselves as victorious, saying they had set out to gain an independent diplomatic representative in Lisbon, and now had one. The historian J R T Wood later called this \\"Rhodesia's first independent and indeed unilateral act—the veritable straw in the wind.\\" On 11 November 1965, less than two months after Reedman's investiture, Rhodesia went one further and unilaterally declared its independence from Britain. The mission in Lisbon operated until 1975, when it was closed following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal the previous year. Background =Responsible government, Federation and the Wind of Change= The alt=A map of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Having been governed and developed by the British South Africa Company since the 1890s, Southern Rhodesia became a self- governing colony within the British Empire in 1923, when it was granted responsible government by Whitehall. The Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, was henceforth empowered to run its own affairs in almost all matters, including defence. Foreign affairs was one of the few areas reserved by the British government. As the Empire's lone self-governing colony, Southern Rhodesia was considered a sui generis case, almost on a par with a dominion. Starting in 1932, Imperial Conferences included the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those from the dominions, a unique situation which continued after Imperial Conferences were superseded by Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences in 1944. As most of the Southern Rhodesian politicians saw it, they were as good as independent; if full autonomy were granted in the form of dominionship, the only practical difference would be a rise in expenses for foreign representation, as Salisbury would have to maintain its own embassies abroad. Believing full dominion status to be effectively symbolic and \\"there for the asking\\", Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins (in office from 1933 to 1953) regarded independence as a non-issue. He twice refused British overtures hinting at dominion status, and instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with the directly administered British colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Mandated by the results of the 1953 referendum, Federation began later that year with Southern Rhodesia, the most developed of the three territories, at its head. Salisbury doubled as Federal capital. The Federation was granted several privileges by Britain during its earlier years; for example, a 1957 British Act of Parliament empowered it to appoint its own \\"diplomatic agents, or consular or trade representatives, in countries which are willing to receive them\\" so long as it informed Britain when it was doing so. The most prominent of these appointments was made in 1961, when the Union of South Africa split from the Commonwealth of Nations and became a republic. An accredited representative of Salisbury was set up in Pretoria soon after, independent of Britain's embassy there. An independent office representing the Federation was also set up in Lourenço Marques, the capital of Portuguese Mozambique, while further afield, Federal officials were set up within the British embassies in Japan, West Germany, and the United States. The Federation ultimately failed because of the shifting international attitudes and rising black nationalist ambitions of the late 1950s and early 1960s, often collectively called the Wind of Change.; The idea of \\"no independence before majority rule\\" gained considerable ground in British political circles as the UK, France and Belgium vastly accelerated their withdrawal from the continent.; Amid a flurry of bloody civil wars, military coups and other disasters, most of the new African countries became autocratic one-party states within a few years. Already wary of black nationalism on racial grounds, Salisbury became increasingly antipathetic towards it as a result of these developments, particularly when the brutal Congo Crisis caused thousands of Congolese whites to become refugees in Northern and Southern Rhodesia.; In 1962, with the Federation in its constitutional death throes amid Nyasaland's clamours for secession and immediate black rule, Federal Prime Minister Roy Welensky was horrified and outraged to be told by Britain's Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Duncan Sandys, that \\"we British have lost the will to govern.\\"; \\"But we haven't,\\" retorted Julian Greenfield, Welensky's law minister. =Federal dissolution; Salisbury pushes for independence= The Southern Rhodesians presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution, they would be first in line for independence, and would receive it without major adjustments to their 1961 constitution. Indeed, intergovernmental correspondence during early 1963 did much to confirm Salisbury's belief that this was the case. While Federal break-up talks progressed, Sandys issued a letter of intent in which he said that powers conferred on the Federal government by British legislation would transfer to Southern Rhodesia at the end of Federation. It was agreed that Salisbury would keep the Federal overseas missions in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques, as well as the British Embassy desks in Bonn, Tokyo and Washington. Arrangements for Federal dissolution concluded in mid-1963, and the Federation formally ended on 31 December that year. Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland became independent during 1964, respectively renamed Zambia and Malawi, under black majority governments. Southern Rhodesia was denied the same on the grounds that whites held too dominant a position, prompting indignation and fury from the governing Rhodesian Front (RF) and its supporters. Prime Minister Winston Field's failure to secure independence from Britain during early 1964 led to his forced resignation and replacement by his deputy, Ian Smith, in April that year.; Two months into his premiership, Smith was deeply offended when Whitehall informed him that, for the first time since 1932, Southern Rhodesia would not be represented at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference as the decision had been taken to only include fully independent states in future. The quarrel over the terms for independence caused the Southern Rhodesian military's traditional British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and motivated Britain to cut off financial aid to Salisbury around the same time. The United States promptly followed suit. Political violence between the rival black nationalist movements in Rhodesia intensified during mid-1964,; leading to jail terms or preventive restriction for several prominent nationalists, and concurrent bans for their respective parties. When Northern Rhodesia became Zambia in October 1964, Southern Rhodesia dropped \\"Southern\\" from its name, and initiated legislation to this effect, but Britain refused assent, saying that the colony could not legally rename itself. Salisbury continued using the shortened name anyway. The Rhodesian government was ardently anti-communist, and opposed immediate black rule, which Smith said would cause \\"the destruction of our country\\", pointing to ongoing events such as the Congo Crisis as evidence. Parliament remained mostly white, but Salisbury contended it had close to unanimous support from all races in pursuing independence under the 1961 constitution, citing various tests of opinion it conducted in late 1964. The Prime Minister stood obdurately against any constitutional change he believed was too radical, regarding this as a matter of national and regional security. According to his memoirs, he worked to prevent a \\"mad rush into one man, one vote with all the resultant corruption, nepotism, chaos and economic disaster which we had witnessed in all the countries around us.\\" The Labour Cabinet of British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, which replaced the previous Conservative administration in October 1964, did not give credence to the Rhodesian tests of opinion, and insisted on majority rule as a condition for independence.; The Commonwealth repeatedly urged Britain to intervene directly should Rhodesian defiance continue, while British liberals worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. =Britain, Portugal and Rhodesia= alt=A map. See description British policy-makers regarded Portugal as a traditional friend—the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance dated back to 1386, and both countries were in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Free Trade Association—but the combined strength of the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby in the United Nations forced the British to peel back their support for the pluricontinental Estado Novo (\\"New State\\") during the early 1960s. Portugal's Colonial War, starting in Angola in 1961, pitted it against a number of guerrilla factions in its African territories, most of which subscribed to communist political thinking. Britain opposed communist encroachment into southern Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly opposed general consensus at the UN, which roundly condemned colonialism in all forms and supported communist-backed insurgencies across the region, regarding them as racial liberation movements. It therefore attempted an awkward balancing act whereby it would appear to oppose Portugal without meaningfully doing so. Britain's stance towards Rhodesia was influenced in a similar way, with Whitehall unable to back down on the policy of no independence before majority rule without causing international uproar. Also contributory was the disproportionate sway over Britain's African policy held by Julius Nyerere, the President of Tanzania, who was a fervent proponent for majority rule across Africa without delay, implemented by military force if need be. British politicians deferred to Nyerere on almost every proposal they made regarding Rhodesia during the 1960s and 1970s. In the immediate post-Federal period, Britain forlornly tried to stifle Rhodesia's further alignment with South Africa and Portugal, realising that British influence in the region was severely limited while the three remained so closely linked. A 1965 British government memorandum described the trio as \\"a defiant and mutually sustaining bloc\\". Great personal rapport developed between Smith and his Portuguese counterpart, António de Oliveira Salazar. On first meeting in Portugal in September 1964, the two Prime Ministers found they shared many common views regarding race relations in their respective countries, Britain's handling of the Commonwealth, and what Smith called the \\"complacency of the major powers of the free world\\" in the face of what the pair saw as inexorable communist expansionism. After hearing Smith's argument in favour of Rhodesian independence, Salazar privately pledged Portugal's complete support. The RF called a new general election for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won a clean sweep of all 50 \\"A\\"-roll seats. A week later, Wilson met with Portuguese Foreign Minister Alberto Franco Nogueira, whom he pressed on Portugal's secret dealings with Rhodesia. Nogueira categorically denied anything of the sort. Rhodesia seeks British endorsement for a Lisbon mission =Gibbs' speech on 9 June= Following the Rhodesian Front's decisive May 1965 election victory, parliament was opened by the British-appointed Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, on 9 June. For the first time, Rhodesia had an official Leader of the Opposition who was black: Josiah Gondo, leader of the United People's Party, now sat opposite Smith and the all-white RF in the Legislative Assembly. Though Gibbs represented the British Crown in Rhodesia, he had been a local resident most of his life, and had feet in both camps, regarding himself as loyal both to Rhodesia and to the faraway monarch. While opening parliament, he told the Assembly that the RF's strengthened majority amounted to \\"a mandate to lead the country to its full independence\\"—later in the speech he referred to this as \\"our independence\\". Rhodesia House was the office of the colony's High Commissioner in London. (2006 photograph)alt=An Edwardian building with six floors stands on a moderate day, a flag flying atop it. Gibbs then said that Rhodesia wished to have the best possible relations with its neighbours, and startled British observers by saying the government had informed him that it would follow recommendations made by Portugal during recent talks, and would open its own diplomatic mission in the Portuguese capital Lisbon as soon as was practical. Evan Campbell, Rhodesia's High Commissioner in London, asked Whitehall the same day to endorse the appointment of Harry Reedman as Rhodesia's \\"accredited representative\\" to Portugal, reasoning that the 1957 act allowing the Federation to do so still covered Rhodesia under the principle of national succession. The 1963 letter of intent from Sandys confirmed this in Rhodesia's eyes. Historian J R T Wood calls this \\"Rhodesia's first independent and indeed unilateral act—the veritable straw in the wind.\\" =Rhodesian motivations= Aside from reinforcing Luso-Rhodesian relations, the Lisbon appointment was designed to secure the African nation a diplomatic foothold in Europe outside of Britain's reach and to help Salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic allies on the continent. Among other things, the Rhodesians intended to make up the shortfalls in military equipment caused by the undeclared Anglo-American arms embargo. Reedman, the former minister for immigration and tourism, was also a retired officer of the British Royal Air Force (where he had been involved in bomber research), and an experienced engineer and businessman: all the right ingredients, the government thought, for someone in the position to source European aircraft, weapons and other equipment, while also representing Rhodesian interests in mainland Europe. Lord Brockway, head of the Movement for Colonial Freedom, believed that Rhodesia was attempting to assert de facto independence in the eyes of the international community by deliberately defying Britain over the Lisbon issue. \\"If Salisbury is permitted to claim diplomatic rights in foreign capitals, its assertion of sovereignty is accepted,\\" he wrote in an article for the British democratic socialist weekly Tribune. =Britain refuses= Britain was caught unprepared by Campbell's request, and issued no response for over a week. In the meantime Campbell, whose retirement was due, was relieved by the Rhodesian government on 10 June. His replacement, Brigadier Andrew Skeen, took over Campbell's London office at Rhodesia House, 429 Strand six days later. Bent on securing Reedman's investiture quickly, the Rhodesian government made it publicly known on 19 June that, pursuant to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days. Whitehall still took no action. Wilson and his Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Arthur Bottomley, were occupied at Chequers, the official country residence of the British Prime Minister, where they were entertaining the Commonwealth heads of state. In Bottomley's absence, his office explored the issue and resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but should not be allowed to appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office. Early negotiations =Rhodesian disillusionment; Britain adopts delaying tactics= alt=A portrait photograph of Harold Wilson Independence talks between Britain and Rhodesia continued for a fortnight without major reference to the Reedman appointment, with Britain more concerned with discussing a possible Rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which he said were unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to hold it together by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged to go on with negotiations, saying that he did not believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line. In dealing with the immovable Smith, Wilson's ministers adopted a programme of deliberate frustration and delay: Britain would interminably stonewall the Rhodesian Prime Minister, maintaining the facade of continued negotiation by very occasionally repeating their stance, in the hope that either Smith would back down, or his Cabinet would eventually lose faith in his negotiating prowess and replace him with somebody more malleable. Wood writes that Wilson, Bottomley and their Labour contemporaries were \\"distracted by their own political agendas\\", and did not understand the extent of Rhodesia's considerable disillusionment with Britain by this time. Effectively \\"kicked ... out of the Commonwealth\\", as Huggins later commented, a fortress mentality was developing in Salisbury, propelling it towards unilateral action. Wood concludes that Britain's maintenance of this stonewalling tactic was misjudged, and only exacerbated the Rhodesian government's feeling of alienation. In the British House of Lords on 26 July, Brockway pressed Lord Taylor, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, on Rhodesia's claims, arguing that failure to block the Lisbon appointment would amount to conceding de facto recognition to Rhodesia as an independent state. Taylor's response was that Britain remained committed to upholding its ultimate purview over Rhodesian overseas relations. Brockway then asked how Rhodesia had attained its independent office in Pretoria; surely, he said, this provided \\"a precedent which was rather dangerous?\\" Taylor replied that Pretoria and Salisbury had exchanged High Commissioners before South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961, and that Britain had granted Rhodesia special dispensation to retain the Pretoria mission thereafter. He stressed that in Britain's eyes this was no precedent for Lisbon. =Britain despatches Cledwyn Hughes to Rhodesia, 22–27 July= The British decided to despatch one of their Commonwealth ministers to Rhodesia for talks during early July, but debated for a while over whether it should be Bottomley or his deputy, Cledwyn Hughes, who should be sent. Wilson considered this a matter of urgency as he had heard a rumour that Rhodesia might declare independence on its main national holiday, Rhodes' Day (that year 12 July), but this proved false. On 15 July, Britain's High Commissioner to Rhodesia, John Baines Johnston, was instructed to propose a week-long round of talks between Smith and Hughes in Salisbury. Johnston was given permission to cave if the Rhodesian Prime Minister insisted on meeting with Bottomley, but this did not prove necessary: Smith cabled back on the 18th accepting Hughes' visit. The British delegation arrived in Salisbury four days later. Discussions proceeded rapidly during the week, but did not touch on the issue of Lisbon until the fifth day, 26 July, when Hughes and Johnston met with Smith, Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont, and Trade and Industry Minister George Rudland. Dupont opened the discussion by referring to Sandys' statement from 1963, which said the Rhodesian government would retain any rights previously granted to the Federation, which Dupont reasoned surely included the ability given in 1957 to appoint its own overseas agents if it informed Britain. As Portugal had indicated its willingness to accept a Rhodesian diplomat, Dupont said, the Rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights. Hughes countered that he did not believe the wording of the 1957 document gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it. Smith replied that in his interpretation Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting the idea that the Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject. Hughes met with several other Rhodesian figures before leaving late on 27 July, but Lisbon remained off the programme most of the time. Just before Hughes departed, Dupont released a statement saying that Reedman would take office in Lisbon on 1 August, and would be \\"warmly welcomed\\" by the Portuguese government. Hughes decried this in a brief telephone call to Smith, but could do little more before leaving Rhodesia that evening. On 29 July, Smith fielded questions from the press, commenting on both Lisbon and the independence talks in general. He expressed the belief that Rhodesia had made more progress towards independence talking with Hughes than it ever had before, but qualified this by saying only Wilson's reply to the proposals given to Hughes would show if this were indeed true. He said that although he thought Whitehall was keen to resolve the independence issue, he did not believe their line had changed. He declared that he and the RF would not change their stance in any way. Moving to the subject of Lisbon, Smith stressed that this was separate from the independence dispute, then overruled Dupont's announcement of two days before: Reedman's appointment would remain provisional until further notice, he said. Anglo- Rhodesian animosity deepens =Bottomley tours West Africa, arousing Rhodesian suspicion= Bottomley toured West Africa during early August, and, in Ghana and Nigeria, gave several speeches reassuring his hosts that immediate majority rule was an unconditional requirement for Rhodesian independence. He ruled out the use of military force in the event of a Rhodesian UDI, and pledged to instead end such a rebellion through economic sanctions. Bottomley's dismissal of the use of force drew damning criticism from Joshua Nkomo, the imprisoned leader of the Marxist–Leninist Zimbabwe African People's Union, who said this showed Britain was not serious about decolonising Rhodesia as it had its other African possessions. Meanwhile, Bottomley's comments increased anti-British sentiment. In his memoirs, Smith describes the mood in forthright terms, accusing Britain of \\"resorting to politics of convenience and appeasement\\". \\"We waited and waited ... [but] the British were not prepared to make a clear decision,\\" he writes; \\"they were consulting the bankrupt and communist dictatorships before replying to us.\\" Becoming exasperated by the lack of progress, even the more hesitant members of the Rhodesian government began to see the road leading towards UDI as the only one viable for them. Lisbon, however, remained the immediate bone of contention, and on this issue the Rhodesians became yet more determined not to give an inch. =Meeting between Johnston and Smith on 18 August= alt=A portrait photograph of Ian Smith Smith organised a meeting with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, with the help of Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had come to the conclusion that Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation. Johnston dismissed Smith's argument, asserting that neither the Federation nor Rhodesia had ever made such an appointment (this was actually false; the Federal government had opened independent diplomatic missions in South Africa and Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia retained them both). Johnston concluded that Rhodesia was trying to prematurely advance its international standing. The previous entrustments, he said, had been made to allow Britain and Rhodesia to cooperate subject to Whitehall's ultimate authority, and did not entitle Rhodesia to do as it liked in the field of external affairs, especially if its chosen line ran counter to Britain's. In an attempt to intimidate Smith, Johnston sternly asked why the Rhodesian Prime Minister would risk causing a major international incident by deliberately defying Britain; Smith replied that following Britain's several slights against Rhodesia over the previous year and a half, Salisbury would not accept another. The conversation continued in this manner for some time afterwards. Smith proposed that the relevant documents be examined jointly by two judges, one British and one Rhodesian, but Johnston refused this. The meeting ended without agreement. =Bottomley returns to Britain= The Rhodesian press reported extensively on the Lisbon controversy during the second half of August, generally predicting that neither Britain, Portugal nor Rhodesia would back down. While most reporters believed that Whitehall would take a strong line, few could see any way it could actually stop Reedman from taking office. On 20 August, Bottomley spoke at his final conference in Lagos, and repeated all he had previously said regarding Britain's stance on Rhodesia. Back in London three days later, he reaffirmed his previous stance regarding Lisbon, saying that he would be pleased to have a Rhodesian on the staff of the British Embassy there, but would allow no more. In the same interview, he expressed the belief that Wilson had averted a Rhodesian UDI in October the previous year by warning Salisbury of the economic consequences. Speaking in Gwelo on 27 August, Smith derided this statement, calling it \\"incredible\\". His administration had not even considered a declaration of independence then, he said, but it was contemplated now, and he believed Anglo-Rhodesian relations were at their all-time lowest ebb. He urged Britain to return to the bargaining table quickly. Britain attempts to block the appointment =Wilson resolves to challenge Portugal= The British continued their policy of stalling Smith. At the end of August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, and could not be exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line. Johnston rued bitterly that the Rhodesians had apparently made practical arrangements for an independent office in Lisbon anyway, even going to the trouble of renting the prospective mission premises. He repeated the claim he had made in the meeting with Smith on 18 August, saying once more that the Federal government had not made appointments off its own bat. He accepted that there was an independent Rhodesian envoy in Pretoria, but argued that this was the result of South Africa's enforced withdrawal from the Commonwealth. He did not mention the Rhodesian (formerly Federal) office in Lourenço Marques, which Wood comments could be considered \\"precedent for Portugal\\". On 5 September, the Salisbury Sunday Mail reported that Smith was standing firm on Reedman's absolute independence in Lisbon, and that Portugal had accepted the envoy. British Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart reacted with alarm, convening an urgent meeting the same day with Hughes and Sir Archibald Ross, Britain's ambassador to Portugal. Here Hughes proposed hauling Portugal over the coals, insisting that the Lisbon mission represented \\"creeping independence\\" for Rhodesia, and therefore had to be stopped. Ross disagreed, reasoning this would only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free Trade Association and more. There was much at stake; Britain enjoyed an annual £48 million trade surplus with Portugal, and Portuguese Railways was in the process of buying 50 diesel locomotives from English Electric. In the Azores archipelago, Portugal provided NATO with a strategically key air base, which was unprotected by treaty; given the inclination, Lisbon might close it. Hughes insisted that there was nothing more they could do to deter Rhodesia directly; they had already threatened to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy in Washington, with no effect. The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the matter with Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed. =Meeting between Johnston and Smith on 8 September; the appointment is confirmed= The same day, Bottomley wrote to Smith, saying that he and Wilson were disheartened by the lack of progress regarding both independence and the Lisbon appointment. He was willing to visit Rhodesia personally, but could not come until October because he had to be in Blackpool to attend the Labour Party Conference, due to commence on 26 September. The next morning, on 8 September, Johnston told Smith that if Reedman proceeded to Portugal in open disregard for Britain's wishes, it would negatively affect future independence negotiations. Rhodesia's delay in justifying the appointment was also having a detrimental affect, Johnston asserted. Finally, he threatened to evict the Rhodesian envoys from Washington, Bonn and Tokyo if Rhodesia did not desist. Smith was yet again unmoved. Any procrastination regarding Lisbon was Britain's fault, he insisted. He told Johnston to wait for the afternoon session in Rhodesia's Legislative Assembly to hear Dupont's official announcement of Reedman's appointment, as well as the full Rhodesian explanation behind it. Smith said he understood this would irk the British, but insisted that he and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically. Johnston protested that the British government could not take part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal. =Britain mobilises NATO support against Portugal; Lisbon insists it is neutral= alt=A grey-haired gentleman wearing a suit, an overcoat and glasses leans forward slightly and looks at something out of shot. Meanwhile, Stewart and Ross argued with Nogueira and the Portuguese chargé d'affaires in London, José Manuel de Villas-Boas de Vasconcellos Faria. On 8 September, Nogueira said the Portuguese were accepting Reedman as a Rhodesian representative, but were not defining his status as they wished to remain neutral in what they regarded as an exclusively Anglo-Rhodesian problem. So far as he could see, Nogueira said, Portugal had done no harm to British interests. Stewart firmly told Nogueira that Britain expected Portugal to make a statement within 24 hours saying that it would not deal with Reedman while he remained off the British Embassy staff. Nogueira replied that his government was not going to accord official diplomatic recognition to Reedman, and that Dupont understood this. Ross now threatened to involve NATO if Portugal did not thoroughly explain its conduct. Unmoved, Nogueira said this surprised him; if the British were so keen to have Reedman on the staff at their embassy, he answered, that was down to them. Portugal was totally neutral in the affair, he insisted. Britain vigorously rallied other NATO countries to take a stand against Portugal over Reedman. France warned that NATO pressure was unlikely to yield results in his matter, but Belgium's NATO representative, André de Staercke, agreed to challenge Salazar on 11 September. At his meeting with de Staercke, Salazar denied that Portugal was giving Rhodesia its own diplomatic representation, and said there had been some misunderstanding. Portugal would not obstruct Reedman's entry should he arrive, Salazar said, as he was travelling on a (Rhodesian-issued) British passport. On 14 September, Nogueira's ministry released a statement saying that if Britain challenged Portugal over Rhodesia at NATO, Lisbon would \\"use the greatest firmness to repel any attempt to attribute particular responsibilities or to make criticism of Portugal's position\\". Britain raised the issue formally in the North Atlantic Council, NATO's most senior political governing body, the same day. Here Portugal's delegate, Vasco da Cunha, argued that given the standing existence of independent Rhodesian offices in Lourenço Marques, Pretoria and London, the matter was between Britain and Rhodesia, and not Portugal's business. Rhodesia had simply asked to have Reedman head a representative office in Lisbon, and he would not present a letter of accreditation. If Rhodesia had exaggerated this, da Cunha said, that was not Portugal's concern. The Italian, Belgian, Danish, French and U.S. delegates in turn sided with Britain, and collectively asked da Cunha to tell his government to publicly declare its non-acceptance of Reedman while he lacked British approval. Da Cunha refused, saying this would only irritate his compatriots \\"because of the neglect by their allies of their interests in the past\\". The meeting broke up without agreement. Whitehall was pleased with the pro-British sentiment displayed therein, while Lisbon remained unmoved. Appointment =Reedman arrives in Lisbon and receives Portuguese approval= The alt=An ornate pink-and-white building in the baroque style is pictured from the front on a sunny day. Having spent the previous week in London, Reedman flew into Lisbon Portela Airport on 15 September 1965. He was met there by the Portuguese Foreign Ministry's assistant chief of protocol, Luis Quartim Bastos, and three Rhodesian officials, who had arrived a fortnight before. Nobody from the British Embassy was present. Bastos told a reporter that he was at the airport on Nogueira's behalf to accord Reedman \\"the classic welcome for the arrival of heads of mission\\". Speaking the next day, Reedman appeared genial and optimistic. \\"We [Portugal and Rhodesia] have everything in common,\\" he said, \\"including the will for survival, an awareness of the true situation overseas, and a greater feeling towards what we are doing.\\" Two days later, Dupont announced that he had issued a letter of accreditation to Reedman for presentation to Nogueira. The envoy would not present credentials, Dupont explained, as he was representing the Rhodesian government, and not its head of state, Queen Elizabeth II. The Deputy Prime Minister expressed confusion regarding the appointment's discussion at NATO, saying that Rhodesia was far outside the organisation's geographical area of responsibility. He said that the letter of accreditation would confer on Reedman the title of \\"Accredited Diplomatic Representative\\", and that Reedman would thereafter head the \\"Rhodesian Diplomatic Mission\\" in Lisbon, which would operate on the same level as the Rhodesian office in Pretoria. The Portuguese Foreign Ministry quickly issued a statement correcting Dupont's wording, saying that Reedman would lead the \\"Rhodesian Mission\\", with no reference to diplomatic status. To Britain's alarm and indignation, the Portuguese government announced on 21 September that Nogueira had accepted \\"a letter of introduction\\" from Reedman, conferring upon him the title \\"Chief of the Rhodesian Mission\\", with powers to deal with the Portuguese Foreign Ministry in Luso-Rhodesian matters without British interference. This followed the precedent set by Reedman's counterpart in South Africa, the statement said. Speaking publicly in Salisbury the same evening, Dupont told reporters that there had never been any intention to claim ambassadorial status for Reedman, and that Rhodesia had constantly kept Britain informed of what was happening regarding the appointment. So far as he was concerned, he said, the Rhodesian government had achieved its objective of attaining an independent diplomatic representative in Portugal, and had not exceeded its mandate in any way while doing so. Britain protested strenuously, saying Portugal was going back on its word. Portugal insisted that its reception of Reedman and his Lisbon mission did not prejudice Britain's responsibility over Rhodesia, and was justified because of the long-standing ties between Portugal and Rhodesia, as well as their common involvement in many southern African issues. =Rhodesia initiates clandestine arms purchases= Reedman carried instructions from Salisbury to spend up to £3 million on European weapons, aircraft and equipment as soon as he could. The Rhodesian government now believed that it would almost certainly declare independence unilaterally and, knowing the purchase of materiel would be more difficult following this, wished to have the Rhodesian Security Forces' necessary ammunition, weapons, spare parts and other equipment in place beforehand. Soon after arriving in Portugal, Reedman contacted the Lisbon-based Zoio brothers, José, Luiz and Jean, who had recently supplied the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola with British-made weapons in direct contravention of NATO's embargo against arming Portugal's African-based troops. The Zoios were interested in stocking Rhodesia's arsenal, and promptly agreed to arrange an order of weapons from a third party on Reedman's behalf in exchange for a letter of credit from the Rhodesian government. Pretending their client was the government of Pakistan, the Zoio brothers contacted a licensed arms dealer from England, Major W R L Turp MBE of Bexley, Kent, who quickly agreed in principle, requesting a letter of credit from a Geneva bank and appropriate end-user certificates for the weapons. Meanwhile, Reedman's military attaché, Wing Commander John Mussell, travelled to Belgium to buy starter cartridges for the Rolls-Royce Avon 109 jet engines used by the Royal Rhodesian Air Force's English Electric Canberra bombers, as well as engines for Rhodesia's Hawker Hunter jet fighters, which were produced in Belgium under licence from Britain. =Reedman speaks on Portuguese state radio, 24 September= On 24 September, Reedman appeared on Portugal's state-owned national radio station, Emissora Nacional de Radiodifusão, addressing the Portuguese nation as \\"head of the Rhodesian diplomatic mission to Portugal\\". He spoke along lines reminiscent of Smith's speech to parliament on 30 June, saying the Afro-Asian element \\"made a mockery of the Commonwealth\\" and enabled Chinese-initiated communist encroachment into Africa. More than one Commonwealth member state hosted training facilities for black communist guerrillas, he said, which threatened all \\"civilised states in Africa\\". He dismissed one man, one vote as false \\"trash democracy\\", and said that in the present geopolitical climate countries run by black Africans inevitably destroyed themselves. \\"This your Rhodesian neighbour will not in any circumstances allow,\\" he pledged. \\"We [Portugal and Rhodesia] stand together in a common cause because of civilisation.\\" Ross rebuked Nogueira for allowing the broadcast, saying its content was insidious and goading. Nogueira agreed that Reedman's words were provocative, but said Portugal could not be blamed as it did not censor public broadcasts. Britain considered withdrawing Ross in protest, but its Foreign Office ruled this out, saying Britain could not afford to be without an ambassador in Lisbon to influence Portugal's actions in the event of UDI. British Cabinet Secretary Burke Trend rejected this view, pointing to Lisbon's conduct regarding Reedman, which he said showed the Portuguese \\"ha[d] very clearly made up their minds\\" to support a Rhodesian UDI. The British ambassador would not be able to affect matters, he surmised, and British interests would be better served by immediately taking a firm hand against Portugal, in the hope that this would send a strong message to Rhodesia. Ross then protested to the Portuguese about Reedman's calling himself \\"head of the Rhodesian diplomatic mission\\" on the radio; Lisbon replied impassively that this was a private expression of views by Reedman, and not Portugal's responsibility. Aftermath =Final steps to UDI= While the British remained firmly against separate Rhodesian representation in Lisbon, there was little they could do to stop it. Ross was nominally put on extended leave, but not withdrawn. Deciding that he could no longer wait for Bottomley to fulfil his promise to visit Rhodesia during October, Smith resolved to instead meet with Wilson personally in London, and arranged to travel on 3 October, arriving the next day. While Smith prepared to travel, Britain continued its frantic efforts to carry international anti-Rhodesian sentiment, among other things urging each NATO member government not to deal with Reedman. In London, Britons who sympathised with Smith came out to support him in large numbers, surprising both the British and the Rhodesians. The two Prime Ministers' talks were largely unproductive, and little common ground was found before Smith flew home on 12 October. Two weeks later, Wilson travelled to Salisbury to continue the talks. The British Prime Minister proposed that future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament might be safeguarded by the revocation of some of Salisbury's self-governing powers, held since 1923. This was a horrific prospect in the eyes of his Rhodesian opponents, and proved the final straw for Smith's government. The Unilateral Declaration of Independence was signed by the Rhodesian Cabinet on 11 November 1965, to almost unanimous international acrimony.; ; The next day the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 216, which condemned the declaration as an illegal one \\"made by a racist minority\\", and called on all member states to withhold diplomatic recognition. =Portugal's role in Rhodesian sanction-busting= Smith was confident that the British military would never agree to engage in what he said would be a \\"fratricidal war\\" against Rhodesia; he was proven correct when a British Ministry of Defence council, convened by Wilson and headed by Denis Healey, Secretary of State for Defence, determined such intervention \\"impossible\\", citing various logistical problems, the danger of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian attack on Zambia, and the psychological issues that would surely accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops. Wilson therefore put all his eggs in the sanctions basket, predicting in January 1966 that the embargo would bring Rhodesia to its knees \\"within a matter of weeks rather than months\\". The UN embargo proved ineffective, largely because both Portugal and South Africa refused to participate. Both declared themselves neutral in the Rhodesian affair, and continued to supply Rhodesia with vital resources such as oil, both at a governmental level and privately. Portugal provided the seaports of Mozambique and the oil refinery at Lourenço Marques. Car stickers marked \\"\\"—\\"Thank You Mozambique\\"—quickly became popular with white Rhodesian motorists. Clandestine trade with other nations continued, initially at a reduced level; among other things, Portugal illicitly labelled unsold Rhodesian tobacco as Mozambican product, then sold it on Salisbury's behalf in Europe and Asia. Through this and a series of similar sanction-busting operations Rhodesia avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson, and, with the help of South Africa and Portugal, gradually became more self- sufficient. Aiming to directly cut off the main supply lines of oil to Rhodesia, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, Wilson set up the Beira Patrol, a Royal Navy squadron based in the Mozambique Channel, in March 1966. This blockade was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. Too small to cover both Beira and Lourenço Marques, and unable to legally fire on tankers once they were in Portuguese waters, the patrol met with little success, but it endured regardless for nearly a decade. The Belgian alt=An FN FAL battle rifle with a wooden stock. The Zoios' clandestine transaction with Turp initially progressed well, but fell apart in March 1966, when Turp discovered he would actually be arming Rhodesia rather than Pakistan, reacted with alarm and informed the British government. The British Board of Trade tightened its control over arms transactions, and encouraged its NATO counterparts to do the same, while the Zoios turned their attention to Belgian, Italian and West German arms dealers. In October 1966, a huge consignment of army and air force equipment arrived in Rhodesia from the seaports of Mozambique, with many of the containers bearing metropolitan Portuguese markings. Prominent among the European weapons were FN FAL battle rifles from Belgium, which allowed an unofficial Rhodesian trade delegation to operate quietly in spite of the sanctions. =Carnation Revolution ends Luso-Rhodesian cooperation= Rhodesia's Lisbon mission remained open throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, providing a key link between the Rhodesian and Portuguese governments, which remained close. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970, Portugal bowed to British diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul-general, João de Freitas Cruz, from Salisbury, but the Rhodesian office in Lisbon remained open. With the Carnation Revolution of 1974, Portugal's African policy was suddenly reversed. By contrast to the former authoritarian government, which had been committed to a pluricontinental Portugal, fighting costly wars against independence movements in its African territories to maintain it, the new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from Africa as quickly as possible. Following hurried negotiations between Portugal and the nationalist guerrillas in each territory, both Mozambique and Angola became independent under communist governments in 1975.; Lisbon's stance on Rhodesia altered accordingly. The Portuguese government ordered the closure of the Rhodesian mission in April 1975, and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia. The Rhodesian mission in Lisbon formally closed on 1 May 1975.

He was the second Lord of Meneses, Lord of Cea, Grajal, Montalbán, and, through his second wife, first Lord of Alburquerque.  Family  Coat of arms of the Téllez de Meneses family: Or, a chain in bend azure.His father was Tello Pérez de Meneses, a powerful noble in Tierra de Campos and Cea, founder, with his wife Gontrodo, of the Monastery of Santa María de Matallana, and three hospitals for lepers and pilgrims in Cuenca, Villamartín, and in San Nicolás del Real Camino. Although mistakenly considered the founders of the Monastery of Santa María de Trianos because of the donation that the couple made in 1185 with the consent of their five children, the monastery had been founded before 1125 the year in which Pope Honorius II issued a Papal bull appointing the abbot and the prior of this religious establishment. The mother of Alfonso Téllez de Meneses was Gontrodo García of the Fláinez family who married Tello Pérez de Meneses around 1161, the year in which he granted her arras. Gontrodo was the daughter of García Pérez, tenente in Cea who distinguished himself in the conquest of Baeza and Almería, and of Teresa Pérez. Gontrodo's parents founded the Cistercian convent of Santa María la Real in Gradefes, which she joined after she was widowed and where she eventually became the abbess.  Life  In 1209 King Alfonso VIII ceded to Alfonso Téllez de Meneses the village of Montalbán. The following year he received as a gift of the king the village of Navahermosa, its castle Dos Hermanas, and the village of Malamoneda and its eponymous castle, splitting them off from the jurisdiction of the Knights Templar. Around this time Alfonso Téllez de Meneses also governed Portillo on behalf of his relative Ermengol VIII, Count of Urgell. He fought at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, which took place on 16 July 1212, along with his brothers-in-law Gonzalo, Rodrigo, Pedro, Nuño, and Álvaro Rodríguez Girón, and his three brothers. Corcos del Valle, Province of Valladolid), founded by Alfonso Téllez de Meneses, who, according to tradition, was laid to rest here. Some of his descendants are buried here, including Mayor Alfonso de Meneses, mother of Queen María de Molina. In July 1213 Alfonso VIII ceded the village of PalazuelosNote that this village does not correspond to any of the towns currently named \\"Palazuelos\\". to Alfonso Téllez de Meneses and he in turn donated it to a Cistercian community, specifically that of San Andrés de Valbení. In 1216 construction began on the Romanesque Monastery of Palazuelos. It was completed in the middle of the 13th century and became the headquarters of the Cistercians of Castile. In February 1216, during the uprising of Álvaro Núñez de Lara, he took part in an extraordinary parliament along with other Castilian nobles including Lope Díaz de Haro, Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, Álvaro Díaz de Cameros, and others, where they agreed, with the support of Berengaria (sister of the young king Henry I), to form a common front against Álvaro Núñez. By the end of May the situation in Castile had become dangerous for Berengaria, so she decided to take refuge in the castle of Autillo de Campos, a property of Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, and sent her son Fernando to the court of León and his father, King Alfonso IX. On 15 August 1216 a meeting was held among all the nobility of the Kingdom of Castile to try to reach an accord and avoid civil war, but their disagreements led the families of Girón, Téllez de Meneses, and Haro distance themselves definitively from Álvaro Núñez de Lara. According to the Crónica latina de los reyes de Castilla, the year 1217 was one of great tension, such as never had occurred in Castile before. Álvaro Núñez de Lara refused to renounce the power he had gained thereto and harassed the forces that remained loyal to Berengaria, laying waste to the valley of Trigueros and besieging Autillo de Campos, where Berengaria and her partisans were located, as well as Cisneros and Frechilla. Circumstances changed suddenly when King Henry died on 6 June 1217 after receiving a head wound from a roof tile that came loose accidentally while he was playing with other children in the palace of the Bishop of Palencia, Tello Téllez de Meneses. Álvaro Núñez de Lara, as the young king's guardian, tried to keep the matter quiet, bringing the king's body to the castle of Tariego, but he could not prevent the news from reaching Queen Berengaria. Immediately, Berengaria charged Lope Díaz de Haro, Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, and Alfonso Téllez de Meneses with the task of discreetly fetching her son Ferdinand, who at the time was in Toro with his father King Alfonso, using as pretext the possibility of an attack on Autillo and without revealing the news of her brother's death. Despite the hesitation of the infantas Sancha and Dulce, the nobles were able to convince the King that King Henry was alive and well, thereupon leaving Toro with Ferdinand. Berengaria, the legitimate heiress to the throne of Castile, renounced it in favor of her son Ferdinand, who shortly thereafter was proclaimed king in Autillo de Campos on 14 June 1217. On 20 September of that year, Alfonso Téllez de Meneses took Álvaro Núñez de Lara prisoner, and Álvaro was obliged to hand over some fortresses. On 11 November a generous truce was signed, allowing members of the House of Lara to recover their liberty and privileges. As soon as he was released from prison, however, Álvaro once again defied his enemies Alfonso Téllez de Meneses, Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, and Lope Díaz de Haro, but he died while laying siege to them in the fortress of Castrejón de Trabancos, where they had taken refuge after an initial defeat. His brother Fernando Núñez de Lara made his way to Morocco, where he placed himself in the service of Caliph Yusuf II. The Pact of Toro of 26 August 1218 ratified the truce and put an end to the conflict. Alfonso Téllez de Meneses died in 1230 while accompanying King Ferdinand on his way to his coronation as King of León, the occasion of the union of the two crowns upon the death of Alfonso IX of León. He was buried, according to tradition, in the Monastery of Santa María de Palazuelos which he had founded. Marriage and children Alfonso married twice. His first wife was Elvira Rodríguez Girón (? – after 22 February 1211), daughter of Rodrigo Gutiérrez Girón. They had four children: *Tello Alfonso de Meneses, subject of chivalric romances on account of his defense of Martos and Córdoba. He died without issue, leaving his brother Alfonso to succeed him as Governor of Cordoba and Lord of Meneses. *Alfonso Téllez de Meneses \\"el Mozo\\", (\\"the Young\\"; ? – 1257), who married María Anes de Limia, daughter of Juan Fernández, tenant-in-chief in Limia y Monterroso, and Maria Pais Ribeira \\"a Ribeirinha\\". Alfonso and María had three children, including, Mayor Alfonso de Meneses, the wife of infante Alfonso de Molina, and mother of Queen María de Molina and her brother Alfonso Téllez de Molina, Lord of Meneses and alférez to the king. *Mayor Alfonso, married to Rodrigo Gómez de Traba, son of Count Gómez González de Traba and Elvira Pérez. *Teresa Alfonso, married to Menendo González de Sousa, and by him the mother of María Méndez de Sousa who married Martín Alfonso, illegitimate son of Alfonso IX of León and Teresa Gil de Soverosa. Between February 1211, the year in which his first wife died, and before July 1213 when he first appears with his second wife, he married the young Portuguese Teresa Sanches, the illegitimate daughter of Sancho I of Portugal and Maria Pais Ribeira, who later married Juan Fernández, tenant-in-chief in Limia and Monterroso. Alfonso probably succeeded to the Lordship of Alburquerque thanks to his second marriage to Teresa, since it was inherited by the children of this marriage, while the Lordship of Meneses passed to his firstborn, Tello, the son of his first wife. The children of this second marriage were: *Martín Alfonso (died after 15 June 1285), who married Mencia Rodríguez. Martín left a will dated 15 June 1285, leaving instructions for his wife Mencia, his sister María Alfonso, and his five children, Teresa, María, Alfonso, Velasco, and Gil Martínez.

Starring Daniel Henney, Eliza Coupe, and Bill Paxton, Shanghai Calling is a story about a group of Americans from different walks of life, who are residing in Shanghai. Synopsis An ambitious lawyer in New York City named Sam (Daniel Henney), who is of Chinese descent, wins a major case for his firm, Powell & Davies, but is told by the partners that he must supervise the Shanghai branch-office for three months or he will not be promoted. Sam flies to Shanghai where he meets Marcus, the firm's most important client, who is CEO of a billion-dollar technology company. Marcus says that he wishes to pay 50 million to acquire a next- generation smartphone from a Chinese inventor, but Sam persuades him, in the interests of speed, to draft a leasing agreement instead, for 5 million. In the following days, Sam becomes acquainted with his Chinese subordinates Fang Fang and Guang, as well as members of the American expatriate community: Donald, a fast-food executive and president of the American Chamber of Commerce; Amanda, a relocation specialist who is fluent in Chinese; and Brad, an English teacher. However, Sam receives a phone call from Marcus, who is furious, having discovered that a Chinese factory is manufacturing and selling the same smartphone. Sam has a tele-conference with the partners of Powell & Davies, who excoriate him and demand that he repair the situation. Marcus and Sam meet with Lin, the owner of the Chinese factory, and his British lawyer. Sam successfully argues that Lin's contract with the Chinese inventor is invalid, since Marcus's was signed a day earlier. Lin agrees to cease production. However, he reneges on his promise, and newly produced smartphones continue to pour into Shanghai's shops. Furthermore, Sam discovers that the British lawyer was a fraud. Namely, he was an actor hired by Lin to pose as a lawyer. With no means of contacting Lin, Sam hires Awesome Wang, a journalist who works on the side as a private investigator. Awesome Wang tracks down the British actor and pressures him into disclosing Lin's residential address, but it turns out to be vacant. Powell & Davies castigates Sam and demands his return to New York. When all appears to be lost, Sam turns to Amanda for help. The latter performs a real-estate search linking the residential address to a factory. Brad offers Awesome Wang and Sam a ride to the factory, and, with the help of Guang's cousin, Sam expedites a legal injunction to have the factory shut down, despite Lin's pleading. Meanwhile, Esther, a highly educated American of Chinese descent, wins the election at the American Chamber of Commerce, replacing Donald as the president. She haughtily points out that Shanghai is quickly becoming a crossroads for the world's best and brightest, and is no longer a haven for middling Americans like Donald, Amanda, and Brad, who could not make it big in their own country. Sam also comments, to Amanda, that he is impressed by Shanghai's rapid economic growth, and by the density of luxury-brands within the city which serves to reflect the changing times. Sam informs Marcus of the closing of Lin's factory, and offers to take the entire blame for Lin's actions, hoping to put the matter to rest. However, Awesome Wang and the Chinese inventor enter the room and reveal that Marcus lied all along. Marcus had, in fact, forged the Chinese inventor's signature on the contract, after arriving too late and being turned down by the inventor. Powell & Davies contacts Sam, and, to his surprise, commands Sam to forgive Marcus and to continue assisting him, owing to Marcus's influence and wealth. Sam, in defiance of Powell & Davies, resigns and opens his own law firm in order to represent Lin. The Chinese staff of Powell & Davies resign and join him.

Photo taken during a 2010 trip to the Caribbean. Miles Spencer Kimball is an American economist who is currently the Eugene D. Eaton Jr. Professor of Economics at the University of Colorado Boulder. From 1987 to 2016, he was professor of economics and research professor of survey research at the University of Michigan. He is also a research associate of the National Bureau of Economics Research. He is a columnist for the online international business magazine Quartz, where his column coauthored with Noah Smith, \\"There is one key difference between kids who excel at math and those who don't\\" was the second most popular article in 2013. Other popular columns have focused on education, immigration policy, how to get into PhD programs in economics, geopolitics, gay marriage, sexism in economics, the Reinhart and Rogoff controversy and negative interest rates. On his blog, \\"Confessions of a Supply Side Liberal,\\" he has been an advocate for eliminating the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates in order to make deep negative interest rates a viable monetary policy option. Three former Federal Reserve officials, Don Kohn, Ben Bernanke and Narayana Kocherlakota, can be seen discussing his proposal for eliminating the lower bound on interest rates here. Many of his blog posts have been translated into Japanese and some into Thai. Kimball is a Unitarian-Universalist lay preacher after having departed from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) around the age of 40 (circa 2000). He has a special interest outside his professional field of economics in the fields of nutrition and fasting.  Biography  Kimball was born to Edward Lawrence Kimball and Evelyn Bee Madsen Kimball on August 17, 1960. He is the grandson of Spencer W. Kimball, the twelfth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and great-nephew of chemist Henry Eyring. As a high school senior, Kimball took 9th place in the USA Math Olympiad. Kimball graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard University in 1982. He then received a master's degree in linguistics from Brigham Young University in 1984. His Master's thesis was \\"Language, Linguistics and Philosophy: A Comparison of the Work of Roman Jakobson and the Later Wittgenstein, with Some Attention to the Philosophy of Charles Saunders Peirce.\\" In 1987, he graduated with a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard and won the David A. Wells prize for the best Harvard dissertation in economics. He became an assistant professor at University of Michigan in 1987 and an associate professor in 1993. In 1999 he also became research professor at the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. He gave the H. Chase Stone Lecture at Colorado College in 2009, held the Jon M. Huntsman Presidential Visiting Professorship at Utah State University in May 2011, and gave the Geneva Risk Economics Lecture in September, 2013. He gave one of two keynote speeches at the Bank of England Chief Economists' Workshop on \\"The Future of Money\\" in May 2015. Kimball married Gail Cozzens, daughter of Matthew Cozzens and Vesa Adams Cozzens, on August 24, 1984.  Research contribution  His general areas of expertise are macroeconomics and cognitive economics. He is especially known for his important work in the areas of precautionary saving and survey measurement of preference parameters. Kimball (1990) first defined the prudence index to measure the intensity of the precautionary motive.Kimball, M., 1990. \\"Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large,\\" Econometrica, pp. 53-73 He was also awarded the Samuelson Prize Certificate of Excellence for his work in survey measurement of preference parameters.Barsky, B., Juster, F. T., Kimball, M. and Shapiro, M., 1997. \\"Preference Parameters and Behavioral Heterogeneity: An Experimental Approach in the Health and Retirement Study,\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, pp.537-579. He also has published well cited articles often in the fields of labor market dynamics, and the economics of uncertainty.Kimball, M., 1993. \\"Standard Risk Aversion,\\" Econometrica, pp.589-611Basu, S., Fernald, J., and Kimball, M., 2006. \\"Are Technology Improvements Contractionary?\\" American Economic Review. (jstor)  Interests  In 2016 Kimball began to give sustained attention to nutrition and fasting, arising from a personal quest to manage his own weight and health. He has collected significant resources on these topics, much of which he has made available online. He has declared Canadian nephrologist Jason Fung's book The Obesity Code (2016) Jason Fung, MD, The Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss (Melbourne, London: Scribe, 2016) - to be the fifth and latest of the five books that have changed his life.

A group of animal rights activists set off to free an imprisoned colleague from a terrifying ordeal but their rescue mission turns into a series of twisted and mind bending incidents. Starring Tom Hardy, Katharine Towne and Melanie Brown. Plot Animal activists Helen, Matt, Louise, and Gary break into an animal research facility, when Gary (McCall) gets caught in a bear trap. Unable to free Gary, the rest of the group flees, leaving Gary to take the blame. A year later, the group has since disbanded until an encrypted e-mail from Gary arrives asking for help. Danny (Bill), who has been visiting Gary in prison, tells the group that Gary has traded his body for experiments in exchange for a reduced sentence. The group, still stricken by guilt one year later, eagerly reunites and investigates the research facility attempting to help find information on the request of Gary. When they arrive to the facility however, they find the place is a dump and abandoned. They continue to investigate anyhow, and soon realize that the facility has been the location of many recent illegal government experiments, not only on animals but on humans as well. They then realize that they are locked in the facility and they battle explosions, chemicals, fires, floods, unknown creatures, and government agents. Helen attempts to recover more information, while Matt and Louise search for a way out. However, they split up, and Matt is captured by the government agents. Helen comes across a computer, and realizes that there are government agents who have gone rogue and are illegally attempting to create a super-human being. She is astonished at the discovery. Meanwhile, Louise is attacked by a rabid animal, but is able to fight it off and electrocute it with wires that are dangling nearby. She then stumbles across a bubbling vat of acid. Realizing that the acid is being heated up, she figures that someone is there and begins to investigate carefully. She enters a storage room nearby and finds Matt inside, all bound and gagged. She realizes that someone is planning on throwing Matt into the acid and she promises to stop them, and to the dismay of Matt, leaves him tied up. Meanwhile, Helen is confronted by \\"The Creator,\\" the individual behind the program. Helen has already printed copies of the research and threatens to expose him and tells him he will go to jail. The Creator laughs it off and attacks Helen, trying to drown her in water. Helen smashes a vase over his head and knocks him backward. The Creator stumbles into chemicals and catches on fire. He tries to get into the water to put it out, but accidentally jumps into chemicals that worsen his flames. He burns while Helen escapes. Meanwhile, Louise is trying to save Matt. She hides behind some cargo after hearing two men approaching going toward the closet. They talk about throwing Matt into the acid and getting rid of him, so Louise ambushes them in surprise, throwing chemicals onto them she grabbed from a shelf. The men scream in agony and try to attack her, but they are startled and blinded. She ends up knocking both of them into the acid in self-defense. After that is done, she starts to retreat, apparently forgetting Matt is tied up. However, Matt realizes that Louise won the fight and hears her leaving, and, although gagged, he screams out hoping Louise will hear him. Louise does hear him and remembers, and she returns to the closet and she helps him and gets him untied and ungagged. Helen, Louise, and Matt all meet up together. Realizing what each of them have gone through, the trio decide to call it a day. They exit the facility, having defeated The Creator and his henchmen, and plan to report it to the FBI. However, the area has flooded, and their van is beneath the water. They borrow a raft from the facility, load themselves into it, and head home.

He has been a leading figure in neo-Nazism and Holocaust denial since the 1970s. Early years Born in Vienna, Küssel first became involved in politics in 1976 when he became a member of Aktion Neue Rechte, a German New Right organisation, and by his admission joined the NSDAP/AO the following year. He was also a member of the neo-Nazi Kameradschaft Babenberg from 1979 until it was outlawed in April 1980 and around this time also edited the far-right magazine Halt. Activism in Austria In the early 1980s Küssel undertook much work amongst football supporters, especially those of Rapid Vienna, aimed at recruiting them to the far right, in particular the Volksbewegung, which he joined in 1982. He was arrested in 1983 and imprisoned on charges of attempting to revive Nazism. Released in 1984, Küssel was involved in a number of minor groups, notably the Nationalen Front and Volkssozialistischen Partei, until in 1986 he established his own extremist movement, the Volkstreuen Außerparlamentarischen Opposition (VAPO). A pamphlet that Küssel produced under the VAPO banner outlining his belief that Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl was a forgery brought him to the attention of neo-Nazis in Germany and in 1987, at a gathering in Frankfurt he was recognised by his German counterparts as Bereichsleiter Ostmark, or leader in Ostmark. VAPO took part in public rallies in Austria whilst also drilling members in military exercises whilst Küssel himself was interviewed on Zick-Zack, a youth programme on ORF, during which he was identified as a neo-Nazi. He also sought to improve his international contacts, holding meetings with the likes of Gary Lauck and Michael Kühnen, and in 1992 attending a conference of historical revisionists in Munich at which the likes of David Irving, Fred Leuchter, Mark Weber and Udo Walendy were leading speakers. Cross-border leadership Following the death of Michael Kühnen in 1991 Küssel joined Christian Worch and Winfried Arnulf Priem in taking control of Kühnen's final group, the Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front (GdNF).Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, Warner Books, 1997, p. 253 In this role he continued to be a public face of neo-Nazism whilst also organising military training for both Austrian and German activists. Having taken over as sole leader of the German Alternative he pushed that movement, which had publicly maintained a legal façade unlike the more openly militant GdNF, along a more openly violent path, resulting in it being banned in 1992.Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p. 105 Küssel would claim that Kühnen had named him his successor on his deathbed.Rand C. Lewis, The Neo-Nazis and German Unification, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, p. 45 His public engagements included a controversial appearance on the American new programme Nightline during which he called Adolf Hitler the greatest man in German history and publicly denied the Holocaust, as well as an interview for Tele 5 in which he called for the re-registration of the Nazi Party as a legal political party. According to Ingo Hasselbach Küssel would also regularly lead his supporters in attacks on refugee centresPeter H. Merkl, Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century, Psychology Press, 2003, p. 298 whilst four of those detained after a letter bomb attack on such an establishment in Vienna in January 1992 were high-profile VAPO members or supporters (although Küssel himself was not arrested in connection with this incident).Institute of Jewish Affairs, Antisemitism World Report 1994, Institute of Jewish Affairs, 1994, p. 3 Küssel had played a leading role in helping to establish neo-Nazi cells in the former East Germany in the immediate aftermath of German reunification.Toe Bjorgo & Rob Witte, Racist Violence in Europe, St Martin's Press, 1993, p. 84 Imprisonment In 1992, along with his ally Klaus Kopanski, Küssel was arrested at his Vienna apartment and charged again with Nazi revivalism. Found guilty the following year by the Regional Court in Vienna, he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. During his absence Austrian neo-Nazism was led by his allies Gerhard Endres in Vienna and Jürgen Lipthay in Salzburg.Lewis, The Neo-Nazis and German Unification, p. 46 Küssel's imprisonment was followed by a number of bombings carried out by neo- Nazi militants using home-made bombs as a protest against the sentence.Brian Loade, The Governance Of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring, Routledge, 1997, p. 221 He was released from prison in 1999, receiving an early release for good behaviour.Küssel: Schlüsselfigur der Neonazi-Szene Subsequent activity Although no longer in an official leadership position, Küssel has continued to be a prominent figure on the far right and has been a regular speaker at a number of neo-Nazi events, often alongside his long-term collaborator Hans-Jörg Schimanek junior. In February 2005 he was fined €360 for possessing illegal weapons after he was found to own a number of daggers and bayonets, which contravened a weapons ban placed on him in 1982.Heribert Schiedel, Der rechte Rand. Extremistische Gesinnungen in unserer Gesellschaft, Vienna, 2007, p. 228 He was arrested again in 2010 after giving the Hitler salute in a Vienna bar and attacking its Venezuelan- born female owner with an umbrella. In 2011 he was arrested in connection with investigations into Alpen-Donau.info, an Austrian neo-Nazi blog and website and on 12 December that same year he was publicly indicted for his involvement in the initiative.Anklage gegen Küssel ist fertig The trial was due to get underway in May 2012 but was twice delayed due to concerns over the jury.Geschworene fehlten, Küssel-Prozess vertagtWieder Wirbel um Geschworene When the trial finally got under way Küssel was found guilty of breaching the 1947 Verbotsgesetz, which bans any attempt to revive Nazism. Presiding Judge Martina Krainz noted the importance of the internet in disseminating extremist information and due to this, as well as Küssel's status as \\"a leading figure in the extreme-right scene\\" with several earlier convictions, she sentenced him to nine years' imprisonment.

Following his removal from the bench, he remained in the territory where he was active in Republican politics and became an expert in mining law and water rights. Early life Stilwell was born on May 24, 1849 in St. Lawrence County, New York to Mary (Brazee) and James Stilwell. He was educated in public schools at Ogdensburg, New York, Gouverneur Wesleyan Seminary, and Potsdam Normal School before his graduation from the Albany Law School in 1875. Following graduation, Stilwell moved to New York City where he worked for the legal firm of Peckham & Tremain. Stilwell's involvement in national politics began in July 1878. When President Rutherford B. Hayes replaced Chester A. Arthur with Edwin A. Merritt as Collector of the Port of New York, Stilwell became Merritt's assistant. In this role he acted as official secretary and also assisted the custom house's legal department. His promotion to the bench came when President Hayes gave Stilwell a recess appointment as Associate Justice to the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. The new justice was commissioned on December 3, 1880 and arrived in the territory in February of the next year. Initially assigned to Prescott, at the time Chief Justice C. G. W. French was requesting reassignment away from the southern portion of the territory. When Stilwell had no objections, the 11th Arizona Territorial Legislature granted the Chief Justice his request and assigned Stilwell to oversee Cochise, Graham, Pima, and Pinal counties. During his time on the bench Stilwell authored no legal opinions as Chief Justice French reserved this task for himself. While on the bench, Stilwell became involved in several political disputes. As part of the efforts to force Governor John C. Frémont to either resign or return to the territory so he could perform his duties of office, Stilwell was proposed as a possible replacement. Conversely there were calls to have the judge removed from the bench. Complaints against Stilwell emphasized his supposed lack of experience and maturity. In a May 1881 letter from Tombstone attorney Thomas Fitch to Senator John Franklin Miller admitted that no specific actions justified Stilwell's removal but that the judge was still too inexperienced to remain. What importance a number of pending cases with large potential financial impact had on the call for the judges removal is unknown. The judges time on the bench came to an end on July 19, 1882 when President Chester A. Arthur nominated Wilson W. Hoover to replace Stilwell. The action was part of a mass removal that saw almost every territorial official replaced in the wake of Governor Frémont's resignation. No reason was given for Stilwell's removal and the judge was in California recovering from an illness at time he received the news. Following his removal, remained in Arizona and became a respected member of the legal community. He moved to Tombstone and opened a private legal practice. There he became an expert in mining law. Stilwell was a representative to the Republican territorial convention in 1888 and was elected to a two-year term as Cochise County attorney beginning in January 1889. Stilwell married Harriet Newell Bean, daughter of Southern Pacific Railroad official A. A. Bean, in 1885. The couple had three children, a son who died from an accident before reaching maturity and two daughters who reached adulthood. During their later years the couple separated with Mrs. Stilwell living in New York. After leaving his position as Cochise County attorney in 1891, Stilwell moved to Phoenix. About this time he was also considered for appointment as a United States Attorney. In 1894 the former judge joined with Henry N. Alexander to form the legal firm of Alexander and Stilwell. With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Stilwell was commissioned a major in the United States Army. Posted in Washington D.C. and San Francisco, California, the former judge served the paymaster department by developing a streamlined system for paying the troops. Following the war, Stilwell returned to his private legal practice. During his legal career, Stilwell argued multiple cases in front of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court and appeared before the United States Supreme Court. While operating a general practice, his primary areas of specialization were mining law and water rights. His most influential case came when he joined with Joseph Henry Kibbey to represent the plaintiff in Slosser v. Salt River Canal Company (1901), 7 Arizona 376, a case that confirmed the \\"Kibbey Decision\\" that water rights belonged to the land they were associated with and not to the owner of the land. In 1916, Stilwell lost a primary contest for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator to Kibbey by a vote of 1857 to 4775. During the Republican state convention of 1928, Stilwell became ill. By the time he returned to his Phoenix home, the illness had become pneumonia. Stilwell died on May 8, 1928 and was buried Phoenix's Greenwood Memorial Park. Footnotes See also *Gunfight at the O.K.

Use Patterns Year-long trace of TeachEngineering visits. TeachEngineering usage closely tracks the US K-12 school seasons. As one can see from the figure above, daily demand follows a strict weekly cycle with usage consistently lowest on Saturdays. Usage starts to increase on Sundays when teachers prepare for classes for the coming week and further increases through Wednesdays. On Thursdays and Fridays demand decreases back toward the Saturday low. On a larger cycle, usage typically increases from the start of the school year (in August) to a peak in late March (around spring break), after which it starts trending down toward the summer vacation. Holidays such as the Fourth of July, and Thanksgiving also clearly stand out in this one- year long trajectory of daily use. Motivation The initial motivation to create the library was the desire to preserve and widely share the outcomes from NSF’s investment in K-12 engineering curriculum development through the creation of a single standardized, searchable and standards-aligned platform. Ongoing motivations include: * To create and maintain a collection of freely available, standards-based engineering curriculum, for the purpose of improving STEM literacy. * To provide curriculum that uses engineering as the vehicle for early development of engineering habits of mind for all youth. * To attract more, and more diverse students to the field of engineeringNSF Grant no.

He is best known for his numerous pastels of street scenes in the historic Jewish town of Kazimierz – now one of the largest central districts of Kraków. His works can be found at the National Museum in Gdańsk, Kraków, Warsaw, and in other state museums in Poland and Israel. Biography He was born to a family of merchants and began his higher education with technical studies, but soon abandoned them, studying instead with professors Leopold Loeffler, Florian Cynk and Jan Matejko at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts in 1886–1895. From 1896 until 1903 he lived in Germany and studied art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich with Franz Stuck. Then he went to Paris, finishing at the École des Beaux-Arts with Jean-Léon Gerome. He also exhibited his paintings at the Salons of 1900, 1901, 1903 and 1904. Markowicz returned to Kraków in 1904 and set up a studio in the historic district of Kazimierz. He traveled to Jerusalem in 1907–1908 where the Bezalel Academy had just opened, then to other parts of Europe until 1914. He was also a member of the \\"Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts\\" and the \\"Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts\\". After 1930, he was the honorary President of the \\"Jewish Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts\\". His Jewish scenes and character-studies show a unique originality of his style influenced by symbolism with elements of expressionism.

Fort Longueuil was a stone fort that stood in Longueuil, Canada from 1690 to 1810. Fort Longueuil was recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on May 25, 1923. The historic site includes the archaeological site of the fort, which was demolished in 1810. The site extends beneath the present-day Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue Cathedral. History The territory of New France was divided into seigneuries in order to ensure the colony's defence. Of these seigneuries, Charles Le Moyne was granted the Seigneury of Longueuil. His son, Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil, built a fort with four towers between 1685 and 1690 as his fortified residence. The fort was built entirely in stone masonry, and included a guard house, a chapel and corps de logis.Acte de concession du comte de Frontenac et de Jean Bochart de Champigny, gouverneur et intendant de la Nouvelle-France, à Charles Le Moyne, écuyer, sieur de Longueuil, le 25 septembre 1698, publié dans Pièces et documents relatifs à la tenure seigneuriale, demandés par une adresse de l'Assemblée législative, 1851, E.

Fort Longueuil was believed to be occupied by American troops during the American Revolutionary War. It was subsequently occupied by the British. It was demolished in 1810 because of its poor condition. Location The fort was located in the Old Longueuil neighbourhood. It was partly situated on the site of the Co-Cathedral of Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue, Saint-Charles Street, Chambly Road, the site of a Laurentian Bank branch and a restaurant.

The first Lutheran community in Italy was formed in Venice in 1650. Within the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Lutheran churches were formed in Trieste (1778), Merano (1861) and Bolzano (1889). Under Prussian influence, communities were formed in Rome (1819), Naples (1826) and Florence (1899). Finally, German-speaking citizens established churches in Milan (1850), Sanremo (1870) and Genoa (1896). Lutheranism flourished in Naples and Torre Annunziata thanks to the missionary work of pastor Idelmo Poggioli. All the aforementioned communities were gathered in the CELI/EKLI since 1949. Other churches were formed, notably in Catania (1991), Verona (2008) and Turin (2009), under the supervision of CELI/ELKI, which was a founding member of the FCEI in 1967.

Football is the most popular sport in Norway. The Norwegian Women's Football Championship is a tournament reserved for women's football teams divided into six levels, consisting of a national championship in the top three under the management of the Norwegian Football Association (NFF), while the lower ones are managed by various regional associations. Toppserien is the biggest football division in Norway by importance and is followed by the 1st division hierarchy. The Norwegian football system consists of a series of alloys linked to each other by hierarchy through promotions and relegations. In each division the teams face an Italian round with round-trip matches. Three points are assigned to the winning team, one point for each team in the event of a draw and zero points for the losing team.  History  Women's football has been played in Norway as early as 1928. The Norwegian Football Federation (NFF) first officially recognised women's football in 1976 and the first national team was established two years later with Per Pettersen becoming Norway's first manager. The first ever win for the female national side came against Northern Ireland and the first major achievement came in 1987 when they won the European Championship after beating Sweden in the final.  National competition  The highest level is the Toppserien, a division consisting of 12 teams, which assigns the champion title of Norway. From the Toppserien they are relegated to 1. division the teams ranked at the last two places of the final standings. The second level is represented by the 1st division, created in 1996 and consisting of 12 teams. The first two classifieds of the 1st. division are promoted in Toppserien, while the last two are back in 2nd division. The third level is represented by the 2nd division, consisting of groups with a variable number of up to 12 teams each, geographically divided. The winning teams of the nine groups, the first two of only group 1, are facing to define the two teams promoted in 1. division, while the relegations are individually managed by the regional associations.  National team  The Norway women's national football team, organised by the Football Association of Norway, have a history of success on the international stage, winning both the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup and the gold medal at the 2000 Olympics. In 2017 the Football Association decided that men and women will get equal pay.

Since June 2012, the CEMD has been carried out by the MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries) collaboration, commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP). The predecessor to MBRRACE- UK, CMACE (Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries) produced a report every triennium, analysing all maternal deaths from the previous three years divided into topic-specific chapters. Reports are now published on an annual basis, with each report focusing on a selection of chapters. Furthermore, each MBRRACE-UK report now contains the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Morbidity (CEMM), a study focusing on women who survived severe pregnancy problems, with the topic chosen in an open application process. The 2014 CEMM topic was maternal sepsis. The most recent report by the CEMD (and the first by MBRRACE-UK) was published in December 2014, and focused on deaths from AFE, sepsis, haemorrhage, deaths from neurological complications, and deaths from other medical and surgical complications between 2009 and 2012. During the time that the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths has existed, there has been a fall in overall maternal deaths in the UK, with rates having fallen from 90 per 100,000 women giving birth in 1952Report on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in England and Wales 1952-1954, p. viii to around 10 per 100,000 at present. Maternal deaths According to the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group, which consists of representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Population Division, the World Bank and world-renowned academics, maternal death is: \\"The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.” In addition, a late maternal death is one which occurs more than six weeks but less than one year after the end of pregnancy. Maternal deaths can be further divided by cause, typically into: direct deaths, resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (e.g. amniotic fluid embolism, pre-eclampsia); indirect deaths, resulting from medical or medical health conditions exacerbated by pregnancy (e.g. cardiac disease) or coincidental deaths, where the cause is unrelated to pregnancy (e.g. RTA, homicide). The CEMD reports on all maternal deaths in the UK and Ireland, including those that are late and/or coincidental. History of the CEMD The current system of confidential enquiries began in 1952, however, the history of smaller, local enquiries dates back to 1917 in Aberdeen, with national enquiries across England, Scotland and Wales following in the 1920s and 1930s.Why Mothers Die - CEMD in the United Kingdom 1997 – 1999, appendix 3 Maternal deaths during this period were particularly prevalent in poor, working-class families, thus a large part of these early local enquiries was focused on the social backgrounds of the women who died. Further emphasis was placed on educating women and their families on the importance of maternity care as well as an understanding of the warning signs of complications and the importance of seeking help. Due to the large number of births taking place in non-clinical settings, avoidable clinical factors were not the only consideration. There was an emphasis on the need for health care workers to improve hygiene standards and ensure training in the use of forceps, and to ensure deliveries requiring other forms of intervention were undertaken in hospital. These local enquiries, along with various medical advances (notably the introduction of antibiotics) were credited with a sharp decline in maternal deaths in the 1930s and 1940s.Report on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in England and Wales 1982-84, Appendix A In 1952 the Ministry of Health instituted the national confidential enquiry for both England and Wales, initially to reports its findings on a three-yearly basis, and since 2014 on a yearly basis. Since its inception, the overall aims of the enquiry have been:Saving Mothers’ Lives: Reviewing maternal deaths to make motherhood safer: 2006–2008, p.25 * To save more women’s and newborns’ lives, to reduce complications, and to improve the quality of maternity services for the benefit of all pregnant women, their infants, and their families. *Through the use of guidelines and recommendations, to help ensure that all pregnant and recently delivered women receive the best possible care, delivered in appropriate settings in a way that takes account of, and meets, their individual needs. In Northern Ireland, a similar report to the CEMD was published from 1956–84, initially covering four years of maternal deaths at a time. However, due to falling maternal death rates in the country, the final reports covered a larger period of time. The final report covering years 1978-84 covered just 32 deaths. Currently, the agency NIMACH (Northern Ireland Maternal and Child Health) is responsible for collecting and analysing data in support of MBRRACE-UK. Scotland also conducted a series of confidential enquiries, with the first dealing with maternal deaths from 1965-71. For maternal deaths from 1985 onwards, a single report has been published for the whole of the United Kingdom. Since 2009, maternal deaths from the Republic of Ireland have also been included in the CEMD, with the agency MDE Ireland responsible for all data collection for maternal deaths from the Republic of Ireland. Since the first CEMD report was published in 1952, maternal deaths have fallen from 90 per 100,000 women giving birth in 1952 to around 10 per 100,000 at present. It is regarded as the ‘gold standard’ for Confidential Enquiries worldwide.World Health Organisation 2004 Confidential enquiry process A confidential enquiry is an enquiry designed to improve health and health care by collecting data, identifying any shortfalls in the care provided and devising recommendations to improve future care. They are confidential in the sense that the details of the patient/hospital/involved clinicians remain anonymous to those conducting the enquiry. The CEMD collects and processes anonymous data of every maternal death in the UK and Ireland before they are looked at by several of the MBRRACE-UK expert assessors. MBRRACE-UK has approximately 100 assessors from different specialty groups including obstetrics, anaesthesia, intensive care, midwifery, pathology, psychiatry, general practice, emergency medicine, obstetric medicine, neurology, infectious diseases and cardiology. Each maternal death case is typically looked at by between ten and fifteen expert reviewers. All of the assessors for the CEMD are volunteers who are not remunerated for their work.SAVING LIVES, IMPROVING MOTHERS' CARE - Lessons learned to inform future maternity, p.3 Once all data has been collected and each case has undergone review, multi-disciplinary chapter writing groups are convened, where the expert reviews of each case are examined to enable key learning themes to be drawn out for the final report. The lead member of each chapter writing group will then draft the initial chapter, which is then reviewed by the other group members and the Programme Lead before a final version is completed. Where possible, any recommendations by the CEMD are linked to national guidance from organisations such as NICE or SIGN. Key findings  The latest CEMD was published in 2014 and focused on surveillance of all maternal deaths from the period 2009-12 and confidential enquiries where the cause of death was from haemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism, anaesthetic-related causes, neurological and other indirect causes. A further sample of survivors of septic shock were also subject to Confidential Enquiry. Between 2009 and 2012, 357 women died in the UK and Ireland during pregnancy or within six weeks of the end of their pregnancy. 106 of these were considered to be direct maternal deaths, representing a statistically significant decrease. The number of deaths from indirect causes increased however, with 215 women dying over the four-year period. The remaining 36 deaths were classified as coincidental. It was commented in news articles, as well as in the report itself that a significant number of late maternal deaths were attributable to psychiatric causes. Despite the overall fall, the researchers claimed there are ‘key areas that the health service can look to improve in order to reduce the number of maternal deaths from these indirect causes’. The report urged clinicians to ‘Think Sepsis’ after almost a quarter of maternal deaths were from sepsis. More specifically, the advice was for staff to take all appropriate observations and act on them when presented with an unwell pregnant (or recently pregnant) woman. Furthermore, rapid administration of intravenous antibiotics and escalating the care of the woman to senior doctors and midwives quickly were considered essential. Another key recommendation of the report was to encourage clinicians to promote the flu vaccine to all pregnant women, with flu one of the leading causes of preventable death in pregnancy (1 in 11 of the women who died). It was reported that less than half of pregnant women eligible for a free flu vaccine had taken it up. The MBRRACE-UK report notes that of the maternal deaths caused by Flu, more than half could have been prevented had the woman received a flu jab. In addition to the full report, MBRRACE-UK publishes an executive summary listing separate key areas for action for policy-makers, medical directors, doctors and midwives. The executive summary, lay report and full MBRRACE-UK report is published online and available publicly.

The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theaters featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorîas (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of Palermo, Sicily. The Sicilian marionette theater Opera dei pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. Today, there are only a few troupes that maintain the tradition. They often perform for tourists. However, there are no longer the great historical families of marionnettists, such as the Greco of Palermo; the Canino of Cinisi and Alcamo; Crimi, Trombetta and Napoli of Catania, Pennisi and Macri of Acireale, Profeta of Licata, Gargano and Grasso of Agrigento. Anyway, you can admire the richest collection of marionettes at the Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino, and at the Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitrè in Palermo. Other beautiful marionettes are on display at the Museo Civico Vagliasindi in Randazzo. The Northwest Puppet Center in Seattle WA and the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta GA also have displays of marionettes in this style.

Early life left Imperiali was born in Genoa on 21 February 1612 to the patrician Imperiali family of that city. He went to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Urban VIII and was appointed vice-legate in Bologna and governor of Fano and Ascoli Piceno. During the absence of Cardinal Antonio Barberini he was appointed legate in Ferrara. He was later appointed cleric of the Apostolic Chamber. During the Wars of Castro, Imperiali was appointed governor of those provinces of the State of Castro under the control of the papacy and was appointed commissary-general of the papal army. He was later sent by Pope Innocent X to Fermo to put down the uprising that had cost the life of its governor in 1648. Pope Innocent appointed Imperiali governor of Rome between 1653 and 1654 Ecclesiastic career Before appointing Imperiali governor, the pope elevated him to cardinal but the elevation was reserved in pectore until Imperiali stepped down as governor in 1654; his cardinalate was published in the consistory of 2 March 1654 and he was appointed cardinal-priest of the Church of San Crisogono. He participated in the papal conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII. In 1660 he was again named governor of Rome by Pope Alexande, but in 1662 he fell victim of the Corsican Guard Affair. Contemporary John Bargrave recounts that while he was governor, François, Duke of Créquy and ambassador of France, visited Rome with his wife. A grave misunderstanding led to the ambassador's wife coach being attacked and fired upon by papal troops from the Corsican Guard. As punishment, Imperiali was transferred as legate to the newly created legation in the province of the Marche. Later he resigned his legation and went to Paris to explain his conduct to King Louis XIV of France. Imperiali participated in the papal conclave of 1667 which elected Pope Clement IX and the conclave of 1669-1670 which elected Pope Innocent XI. During these conclaves, Imperiali was a senior member of the liberal movement Squadrone Volante. It is thought the group engineered the election of Giulio Rospigliosi as Pope Clement in 1667. Imperiali died on 21 September 1673 in Rome and was buried in the chapel of Saint Thomas of Villanova in the Basilica di Sant'Agostino. A grandson of his brother, Giuseppe Renato Imperiali (born 1651), who had lived in his household since 1662, would be named cardinal in 1690.

Analysis of the surveys states that \\"Comcast is one of the lowest scoring companies in ACSI. As its customer satisfaction eroded by 7% over the past year, revenue increased by 12%.\\" The ACSI analysis also addresses this contradiction, stating that \\"Such pricing power usually comes with some level of monopoly protection and most cable companies have little competition at the local level.

Frequent complaints about Comcast's service include \\"stuffing\\" bills with unnecessary services, hidden service fees, outsized cancellation fees and improper credit checks. =Customer service after Hurricane Ike= Shortly after Hurricane Ike hit the Galveston, Texas area in 2008, customers received bills and later collection notices for unreturned equipment that was destroyed during the storm. One customer reported a $931 bill which included a $66 credit for interrupted phone service, but also included a $1000 charge for not returning her rented DVR, Cable Modem, and other equipment. Comcast responses differed after the storm, with some Customer Care agents telling customers to file with their insurance providers, and other agents advising customers to return their equipment, even if it was ruined or moldy. =2014 customer service scandals= In July 2014, technology journalist Ryan Block recorded a conversation with Comcast during which he attempted to disconnect his service. The recording immediately went viral, resulting in an official apology from Comcast. In August, two similar stories went viral. One customer posted a YouTube video in which his call to cancel his service was put on hold until Comcast customer support offices closed. Another customer recorded a series of conversations in which Comcast promised him he would not be charged for certain services, charged him anyway, and then refused to reimburse him for the charges until he revealed that he had recorded the initial call. When the representative explained that she would only credit him because of the recording, the customer asked, \\"You're telling me that if I didn't have a recording of that call, you wouldn't have been able to do it?\\" \\"Yes, that is correct,\\" she replied. In the same month, Rapper Dann Furia blogged that he had contacted Comcast 25 times in six months without any resolution to a problem of $1,320 in wrongful charges. Comcast customer Conal O'Rourke made headlines in October after his accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), fired him as a result of his complaints against Comcast. O'Rourke contacted Comcast several times to dispute overcharging and improper fees, but problems continued for a year without resolution. He contacted Lawrence J. Salva, Comcast's Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, and after more failed attempts at resolution threatened to involve the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Salva then contacted a partner at PwC and alleged that O'Rourke had behaved unethically. PwC terminated his employment as a result. Neither Comcast nor PwC will release recordings or documentation of O'Rourke's calls; they have also refused to disclose the content of the communications between Salva and the PwC partner that resulted in the decision to dismiss O'Rourke. PwC provides consulting services for Comcast, from which it garners upwards of $30 million a year in revenue. Salva was himself employed as a partner at PwC for 12 years before joining Comcast. =2015 customer name change scandal= In January 2015, Lisa Brown, a Comcast subscriber from Spokane, Washington called Comcast in attempt to downgrade her cable package, she was offered an upgrade which she denied. On her next billing cycle, she discovered the name on her bill was changed to \\"Asshole Brown\\". Comcast released a statement stating, \\"We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change, We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.\\" The employee in question was terminated. Brown's name was fixed, and a refund for 2 years of service was given, along with 2 more years of service for free. =Washington state lawsuit= In 2016, Bob Ferguson, the Attorney General of the state of Washington initiated a lawsuit against Comcast. He alleged that their equipment insurance plan, called the Service Protection Plan was “deceptively added the SPP to many of its Washington customers’ accounts without their knowledge or consent.\\" The suit, which also claimed that the plan provided little actual coverage, asserted that Washington residents had paid for $73 million for the fraudulent services.

TechTV acquisition Comcast announced on March 25, 2004 that its new gaming-oriented television network G4 (operated by subsidiary G4 Media, Inc.) would acquire Vulcan Venture's technology-oriented television network TechTV. The deal was finalized on May 10, 2004 and the two networks became G4techTV on May 28, 2004. This led to the cancellation of many of the TechTV channels throughout carriers across the world. On January 3, 2005, TechTV International began airing select programs from G4techTV. On February 15, 2005, the TechTV brand was dropped from the United States G4techTV feed, leaving the network name as G4 – Video Game Television. Since then, G4 has gone through a rebranding into a male oriented network. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV and its well-known personality Leo Laporte. Around May 6, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles, California, if they agreed to relocate there.

When customers accidentally typed a non-existent Web address in their browser, they were then redirected to a Comcast search page saying the page was not found and offering alternatives. Comcast called this option \\"Domain Helper\\" and gave customers an option to disable it.

On October 10, 2008, the FCC ruled as follows: \\"In the Second Report and Order, the Commission emphasized that the statute \\"does not explicitly prohibit multichannel distributors from acquiring a financial interest or exclusive rights that are otherwise permissible,\\" and thus, that \\"multichannel distributors [may] negotiate for, but not insist upon such benefits in exchange for carriage on their systems.\\" The Commission stated, however, that \\"ultimatums, intimidation, conduct that amounts to exertion of pressure beyond good faith negotiations, or behavior that is tantamount to an unreasonable refusal to deal with a vendor who refuses to grant financial interests or exclusivity rights for carriage, should be considered examples of behavior that violates the prohibitions set forth in Section 616.\\" We find that the NFL has presented sufficient evidence to make a prima facie showing that Comcast indirectly and improperly demanded a financial interest in the NFL’s programming in exchange for carriage. We further find that the pleadings and documentation present several factual disputes as to whether Comcast’s retiring of the NFL Network is the result of Comcast’s failure to obtain a financial interest in the NFL’s programming. Accordingly, we direct an Administrative Law Judge to hold a hearing, issue a recommended decision on the facts underlying the financial interest claim and a recommended remedy, if necessary, and then return the matter to the Commission within 60 days.\\"FCC: Programmers make case for discrimination.

Many products seek to hide the effects of aging while others claim to alter the body's chemical balances to slow the physical effects of aging. A comprehensive grading scale for anti-aging of the skin has been validated and categorizes skin aging as: laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), and the various categories of photoaging, including erythema (redness), dyspigmentation (brown discolorations), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths), and poor texture. Despite great demand, many such products and treatments have not been proven to give lasting or major positive effects. One study found that the best performing creams reduced wrinkles by less than 10% over 12 weeks which is not noticeable to the human eye. Another study found that cheap moisturizers were as effective as high-priced anti-wrinkle creams. Traditionally, anti-aging creams have been marketed towards women, but products specifically targeting men are increasingly common.  Skepticism  The belief in the benefits of anti-aging creams, along with their use, should be met with skepticism. Nearly every brand and type delivers information about the product being “scientifically tested” or “scientifically proven” however, the results of these studies are rarely made available to consumers. This suggests that the legitimacy of these studies and subsequent results are highly questionable. Aging is a natural process which is accompanied by normal physical, chemical, and biological changes in the body. These changes include facial and body wrinkling of the skin and this process is common to all human beings. To believe so easily that a cream could prevent and/or reduce the process of skin aging all on its own does not fit with how the world really works. If this problem had such a simple solution, individuals (including our ancestors) would likely have perfect complexions free of age-related problems. Similarly, if the solution to anti-aging was so easy for us to attain, there would be no need for hundreds or thousands of products on the commercial market which provide similar claims yet produce products with differing ingredients. Theoretically, cosmetics promise to alter or “enhance” function, however they do not change any cellular or biochemical reactions or processes within the skin. Secondly, these products and chemicals are unregulated by any governing body, thus allowing potentially dangerous or harmful ingredients to be added with the promise of results. Before blindly accepting that certain chemicals cause anti-aging results, it is necessary to do research to determine the safety of these products.  Products  Products marketed as anti-aging include anti-aging creams.

She was the second ship named after Pietro Micca, the Savoyard soldier who became a national hero for his sacrifice in the defence of Turin against the French troops in 1706. This boat was the prototype for a class of fast, long range submarines with conventional torpedo armament, naval mine laying capability, and useful secret transport capacity. The ship was built at the Tosi shipyard in Taranto. She was laid down on 15 October 1931 and launched on 31 March 1935. The boat fully met design requirements, but was too expensive to be repeated. Career Pietro Micca was delivered to the Navy on 1 October 1935. The boat undertook two Spanish Civil War patrols in support of Francisco Franco on 23 January and 13 February 1937. As the largest Regia Marina submarine, Pietro Micca led the submarine fleet for the 5 May 1938, Naples naval parade to honor Adolf Hitler. Micca was at sea when Italy declared war, and laid a minefield off Alexandria on 12 June 1940. Micca returned to lay a second minefield off Alexandria on 12 August 1940. Italy kept the vessel in the Mediterranean Sea despite Kriegsmarine requests for temporary assignment to BETASOM to assist minelaying at Freetown, Cape Town, and Madagascar. Transport of food, gasoline and ammunition to the Aegean Sea and North Africa became her primary mission by the end of 1940; and Micca transported a total of 2,163 tons of essential cargo in 14 resupply missions before being torpedoed by southwest of Cape Santa Maria di Leuca at 06:05 on 29 July 1943.

It was the ninth named storm and the fourth typhoon of the 2012 Pacific typhoon season. Saola is the name of a rare mammal found in Vietnam. Meteorological history On July 26, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of strong vertical windshear in the monsoon trough about to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. During that day the shear relaxed before during the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system. Severe Tropical Storm Saola over Taiwan Early on July 28, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, whilst the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Saola. Soon, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression and named it Gener. Later that day, the JTWC upgraded Saola to a tropical storm. Early on July 29, the JMA upgraded Saola to a severe tropical storm. On July 30, the JTWC upgraded Saola to a category 1 typhoon, as it started to develop an eye-like feature, but soon downgraded it to a tropical storm late on the same day. On July 31, the JTWC upgraded Saola to a category 1 typhoon again. Late on the same day, the JMA upgraded Saola to a typhoon, and the JTWC soon upgraded it to a category 2 typhoon early on the next day. The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported that Typhoon Saola made landfall over Xiulin, Hualien in Taiwan at 19:20 UTC on August 1 (03:20 TST on August 2). However, Saola later moved counterclockwise and arrived the ocean soon, whilst the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm early on August 2 due to strong land interaction. At 06Z on the same day, Saola passed over Cape San Diego, the easternmost point of Taiwan. Late on August 2, the JMA downgraded Saola to a tropical storm, before it made landfall over Fuding in Fujian, China at 22:50 UTC (06:50 CST on August 3). On August 3, the JMA downgraded Saola to a tropical depression, after the JTWC issued a final warning on the system. The system continued to weaken into a weak low pressure area over Jiangxi, China on August 4. The weak, remnant low later drifted south west to the Gulf of Tokin, and regenerated slightly on August 7. Preparations and impact =Philippines= Saola caused widespread rains in the Philippines due to the enhancement of the southwest monsoon. On July 29, domestic and international flights throughout the country were delayed and cancelled. Small fishing crafts were advised to not engage in the water as a gale warning was issued by PAGASA. The NDRRMC alerted their agency as the storm is expected to bring heavy rains. Seaports were also advised to cancel their trips. Flooding is imminent as different dams are expected to reach its critical level and possibly release huge millimeters of water. About three roads in northern Luzon were impassable due to floods and landslides. About sixty families in Rodriguez, Rizal were evacuated due to severe flooding in the area. Early on July 30, classes were suspended from pre-school to tertiary level as strong winds and severe rainfall were recorded throughout Metro Manila and nearby provinces. In all, 54 fatalities were confirmed in the Philippines, with three others went missing and 35 people were injured. Almost 950,000 people were affected by Saola. More than 9,300 houses were damages. Damage from the storm amounted to ₱728 million (US$17.3 million), more than half of them was due to agricultural losses. =Taiwan= As the storm made landfall in Taiwan, almost the entire island suspended services as high winds and rains triggered flooding in several locations. Almost 70 inches fell in some areas, ranking Saola within the top 5 wettest cyclones to ever hit the island. Authorities ordered schools and business to shut, with the exception of few major factories. Financial markets were also closed, and would remain until 3 August. Taiwanese Army soldiers rescued more than 1,000 people from remote mountainous villages in the north and east. Two passenger boarding bridges collapsed at Taoyuan International Airport, which serves Taipei, slightly damaging a China Airlines aircraft and forcing the company to scrap the flight. More than 200 international and domestic flight were reportedly cancelled because of the storm. At least six people were killed and two were missing in Taiwan as of 2 August, in addition to 16 injured. Agricultural losses across the island reached NT$1.02 billion (US$34 million). =China= In Fujian Province, a total of 9,708 homes were destroyed and 36,726 more were damaged. Preliminary damage was estimated at ¥1.02 billion (US$160 million). In Hubei Province, over 135,000 people were displaced by the floods and left in need of assistance across the province. In total, 25 people were killed in China, and total economic losses were counted to be CNY17.15 billion (US$2.68 billion).

The Incredibles is the first Pixar film to be scored by Giacchino. Director Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film's design — the future as seen from the 1960s. John Barry was the first choice to do the film's score with a trailer of the film given a rerecording of Barry's theme to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. However, Barry did not wish to duplicate the sound of some of his earlier soundtracks; the assignment was instead given to Giacchino. The soundtrack was released on November 2, 2004 by Walt Disney Records, three days before the film opened in theaters. It won numerous awards for Best Score and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Music used for the film's trailers but not available on the soundtrack album includes \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" from the Propellerheads album Decksandrumsandrockandroll as well as excerpts from the David Arnold project Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project. The animated short Jack-Jack Attack, which accompanied the film's DVD release, also features the \\"Alla Turca\\" movement from Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11, 4th movement of Eine kleine Nachtmusik and Dies irae from Requiem. Recording Giacchino noted that recording in the 1960s was largely different than modern day recording and Dan Wallin, the recording engineer, said that Bird wanted an old feel and as such the score was recorded on analogue tapes. Wallin noted that brass instruments which are at the forefront of the score of The Incredibles, sound better on analog equipment rather than digital. Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino \\"the right way\\" which consists of everyone in the same room \\"playing against each other and feeding off each other's energy\\". Tim Simonec was the conductor and orchestrator for the recording of the score. Awards The film's orchestral score was released on November 2, 2004, three days before the film opened in theaters. It won numerous awards for best score including Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, BMI Film & TV Award, ASCAP Film and Television Music Award, Annie Award, Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award and Online Film Critics Society Award and was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, Satellite Award and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award.

Xokonoschtletl Gómora (; born 17 February 1951, in Mexico City, Mexico) is a Mexican dancer who performs to Pre-Hispanic traditional music, a writer, lecturer, and civic activist. He was commissioned by the United Nations for the Frente Mexicano Pro Derechos Humanos (English: Mexican Front for Human Rights) to promote the protection of Mexican cultural heritage. He is best known for leading the Asociación Civil Internacional Yankuik Anahuak (International Civil Association of the People of the Valley of Mexico) and because for over thirty years he has pushed for the return of a quetzal feather headdress (Nahuatl: quetzalpanecáyotl) known as Montezuma's headdress currently located in the Vienna Museum of Ethnology (German: Museum für Völkerkunde). Activities Xokonoschtletl began working as a tourist guide and became involved with indigenous activists who promoted the protection of traditional Mexican culture. He later founded the Asociación Civil Yankuik Anahuak (International Civil Association People of the Valley of Mexico), through which he has struggled for thirty years, without financial support from the government, for the return of a quetzalpanecáyotl (quetzal feather headdress) known as Montezuma's headdress housed at the Vienna Museum of Ethnology (Museum für Völkerkunde). Apart from quetzal feathers, the headdress is ornamented with gold and precious stones, and \\"is considered the most valuable Mexican relic that is abroad\\", Xokonoschtletl is also a member of the Frente Mexicano Pro Derechos Humanos (Mexican Front for Human Rights) and its representative to the United Nations. He considers it very important that the plume be brought back to Mexico because it \\"is part of [Mexico's] identity and national culture\\". As part of this movement, every year since 1986, he organizes a march that goes from the UN offices in Vienna, to the Houses of Parliament, as well as artistic and cultural events. Over the years his request has been supported by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH, National Institute of Anthropology and History), by Thomas Klestil, when he was president of Austria, and Heinz Fischer, current Austrian president and then president of the parliament. He was supported by Austrian legislators, too. The members of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, led by Peter Schieder (chairman of the parliamentary committee of Foreign Policy), presented a proposal to return the headdress in 2005. In this initiative they said that it would be a token of gratitude for the Mexican people, because Mexico was the first country to show their support to Austria in 1938, protesting against its annexation to Nazi Germany. In 2009, legislators of the Communist Party of Austria presented a new initiative with a similar proposal. In Mexico, the movement has been supported by the deputy Jorge Triana, National Action Party member, and Rafael Elias Sanchez of the Party of the Democratic Revolution. Xokonoschtletl is the official spokesman of the Consejo Mundial de Pueblos Indígenas (World Council of Indigenous Peoples), and participates in civic activism, promoting the protection of cultural heritage and the support of ethnic minorities and disadvantaged people. His Pre- Hispanic traditional dance music group, called Ometoetl has presented several shows in Germany, as \\"La danza del venado\\" (Deer Dance). He is a lecturer and writer as well. Among his works written in Spanish are: Lo que nos susurra el viento: la sabiduría de los aztecas (1998), Sentémonos al fuego: cuentos y relatos de la tradición azteca (1998) and Juicio a España Testigos Aztecas (2007).

History The church derives its name from a guado or fording (vado in dialect) that was located nearby. A church at the site was documented since the tenth century, but on Easter of 1171, a eucharistic miracle occurred when blood spouted from the host during consecration.Memorie istoriche delle chiese di Ferrara e de' suoi borghi by Giuseppe Antenore Scalabrini, page 314-316. This made the church an object of pilgrimage. This miracle that appears to confirm transubstantiation resembles the subsequent events depicted in The Mass at Bolsena by Raphael. Reconstruction was started in 1495 under the patronage of Ercole de' Roberti under the designs of Biagio Rossetti. The church contains paintings by Carlo Bononi, Camillo Filippi, Prospero Fontana, Giuseppe Antonio Ghedini, and Domenico Mona.Il servitore di piazza, guida per Ferrara, By F Avventi (conte.), page 127-137.

Life  He was a student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1571, and graduated B.A. 7 July 1573, and M.A. 6 July 1576. He was subsequently (11 December 1581) rector of Horringer in Suffolk. Initially he was on good terms with local Puritan figures such as John Knewstub and Walter Allen; but his own views changed within a few years. Rogers was an early opponent of Nicholas Bownde in the Sabbatarian controversy. Rogers became chaplain to Richard Bancroft, and assisted him in literary work. He died at Horringer, and was buried in the chancel of his church there, 22 February 1616.  Works  Rogers's major works were on the English creed: * , and * . The latter subsequently appeared in another form as an exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles, entitled This book was later praised by Augustus Toplady, Edward Bickersteth and other evangelical divines, and was reprinted in 1854 by the Parker Society. Popular were Rogers's translation of The Imitation of Christ (London, 1580); often reprinted till 1639 and his Of the Ende of this World and the Second Coming of Christ, translated from the Latin of Scheltoo à Geveren, London 1577, 1578, 1589. The latter work endorsed the conclusions of George Joye on the second coming as due in the sixteenth century, and with more specific predictions to the later 1580s.

She emigrated to the United Kingdom in the 1950s. In 1961, she married Ralph Miliband (1924–1994). Their two sons, David Miliband and Ed Miliband, have risen to prominence in modern-day British politics. Birth and early life Kozak is the daughter of wealthy Jewish parents, Bronislawa (Landau) and Dawid Kozak,The Sitkowski Family . Retrieved 5 October 2014 in the Polish town of Częstochowa, with a Jewish population of about 40,000 in 1939, or a quarter of its population.http://www.czestochowajews.org/docs/joc-brochure_pol.pdf In 1939 when the Germans took control, the Kozaks' factory was commandeered and transformed into a munitions plant. In the town, an estimated 2,000 Jews were murdered by Germans on the spot and another 40,000 transported to the gas chambers at the Treblinka extermination camp. At some point Polish nuns in a convent took the Kozaks in and hid them from the Germans. Marion refuses to divulge where or when this took place. She also credits the \\"kindness and generosity of acquaintances in Warsaw\\" for her survival. She was also known as Maria. In the only official version of events, a biography of her husband Ralph Miliband written by a family friend, Michael Newman states that: \\"For the rest of the war Marion, Hadassa and their mother had been in constant danger and owed their lives to several brave people, Jewish and non-Jewish, many of whom were themselves killed.\\" In 2009 David Miliband, in his capacity as the Foreign Secretary, expressed his thanks to the Polish people for having saved his mother during the Holocaust. During an official visit to Poland he said: \\"My mother was born here, her life was saved by those who risked theirs [by] sheltering her from Nazi oppression\\". Newspaper reports stated that \\"his paternal grandparents were also Polish Jews\\". Marriage to Ralph Miliband According to The Guardian, Marion Kozak had once been a student (at the London School of Economics) of the Marxist scholar Ralph Miliband. They married in 1961. Her background and politics were similar to his, and she had a comparable, though less high-profile, career as an activist and academic. Yet she was more outgoing and had broader interests. In 1965 their son David Miliband was born. Kozak hosted relatives, left-wing writers, dissidents such as Joe Slovo of the South African Communist Party, academics from abroad, the occasional politician. Sons David and Ed Miliband (born 1969) were encouraged to join in. Political views Kozak has been described in London's The Jewish Chronicle as a long-standing human rights campaigner and an early activist for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (in parallel with being described as keeping \\"a low profile\\" and being \\"a very private woman\\"). Kozak is also described as being \\"a long-standing supporter of left-wing pro- Palestinian organisations\\" and is a signatory of the founding statements of both Jews for Justice for Palestinians (founded 2002) and a supporter of Independent Jewish Voices (launched 2007). Long-time friend Tariq Ali wrote in The Guardian in 2015 that Kozak was a \\"strong-minded socialist and feminist\\" Influence and stance towards her sons A BBC report described Kozak as a \\"campaigning mother\\" who, unlike her husband Ralph, remained loyal to the British Labour Party. However, she is thought to have been a greater influence on the political development of her sons. \\"There's no doubt that Ed got a lot of his drive from Marion and a lot of his feel for nitty-gritty grassroots politics from Marion too,\\" according to Dr. Marc Stears, politics fellow at the University of Oxford. Friends have stated that the contest between the brothers has been a huge \\"strain\\" for their mother and that she has even told people it would have been much easier had they simply become academics rather than politicians.

It is in the 7th Karsog subdivision of the Mandi district in Himachal Pradesh in India. It lies in the Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas bordering the Shimla and Kullu districts. History Karsog is an ancient town and is described in folk tales of the epic Mahabharata. Karsog is the combination of two words: \\"Kar\\" and \\"sog\\", translating to \\"daily mourning\\". According to the Mahabharata, during the time of Pandavas, a Rakshasha used to eat a townsperson each day. During their exile, Pandavas visited the town and came to know about the demon. Bhim destroyed a demon by offering himself as food as an alternative to eating the villagers. This relieved the town of its daily mourning. Pandavas build many temples in this area. Tourism Karsog town Karsog is famous for its temples, including the Mamlesh-war Mahadev, Kamaksha Devi, MahunNag, Someshwar Mahadev Somakothi temples. Accessible from the state capital Shimla, the tracks around Karsog and Chindi are among the most picturesque areas of Himachal Pradesh. There are wide valleys crisscrossed by streams and carpeted with fields of assorted vegetables and grain. From fertile floors, orchards and thick forests rise to touch snow-covered peaks. Karsog Valley (3)The small villages and their age-old architecture give expression to the phrase ‘picture perfect’. Legends and folklore abound, and every one of the temples is a repository of local culture and an example of remarkable building skills. Named after the local deity, Chandika (Chindi) Mata, the tiny village of Chindi rests along a highway that services Shimla, Karsog and Mandi. A little further ahead, at the village of Bakhrote, is the bifurcation to Kullu and Manali along a less traveled but thoroughly delightful route. In some ways, the area harks back to old ‘hill stations’ before they became over-built messes – a few scattered houses, the little bazaar or two, patches of forests and wide open views. From the hotel at Chindi, the rise of Khoo Dhar is accessed through the Karsog bazaar. This large flat hilltop presents a 360 degrees view of the area. The Karsog valley lies below, to the north is the peak of Shikari Devi. Some of the other well-known ranges and mountains visible from Kunhoo Dhar are the Pir Panjal, the Hanuman Tibba, the rises around the Jalori Pass, the bare Chawasi Tibba, Narkanda’s Hattu Peak and the Shali Tibba. The villages of Churag, Chindi, and Mahunag form a part of the foreground and the other sightseeing places of Dhamoon and Sairi Bangla ( Bungalow ) are also visible. Kunhoo Dhar has a large pond and big ground while a low rise holds the small temple dedicated to both Kamakshya ( Kamakhya ) Devi and Nag Dhamooni. Local tradition has it that this was the site of the original palace of the former princely state of Suket – in whose territories these tracts once were. Karsog Valley Power Lines Electricity Farms Himachal Pradesh IndiaThe village of Karsog is surrounded by wide steps of fields and holds the main bazaar of the valley. Agriculture is the mainstay of the area and it is well known for its wheat, corn, rice and a variety of lentils and beans. The valley is crisscrossed by several brooks and the ‘twin’ Amla ( Imla ) and Bimla streams. From the Karsog bazaar, the village of Mamel is a bare couple of kilometres and has the temple of Mamleshwara Mahadev. Local belief has it that the temple dates to the times of the epic Mahabharata when it founded by the Pandava brothers. And drawing on India’s other great epic, the Ramayana, it is regarded that after King Ravana of Lanka was killed by Bhagwan Rama, his soul could not be free till an image of Bhagwan Shiva was installed here—which was done by Rama with the use of supernatural powers. The sages Parshurama and Brighu are also believed to have meditated at the spot. Using sleepers of considerable girth, the temple is an attractive wood and slate structure and it is believed that the sacred fire in the temple has been kept burning from times immemorial - and that the level of the ashes never increases. There is an unusually large drum in the temple with rhinoceros hide. Also shown on request, is a large grain of wheat supposedly dating to the mythological times of the Satya Yuga. Some recently excavated shivalingas have been installed by the side of the temple. Kamaksha Temple thumb A little further down lies the village of Kau and the temple of Kamakshya Mata. The goddess in this temple is seen as manifest at the spot, due to the meditations and sacrifices of Lord Parashurama. Today, the remarkable expression and the intensity of the eyes of the principal image cast in ‘ashtadhatu’, the eight primary metals, is striking. The deity is depicted as the Mahishasuramardini—the slayer of the demon Mahisha, who stalked the world in the shape of a buffalo. Rebuilt in the original genre, the temple is an example of local woodworking skills. Small chambers hold other images and the ‘bedchamber’ of the goddess. The sanctum sanctorum of the temple is said to be an underground chamber that is not accessible to worshippers. The original stone image of the deity is in this room. A large drum, similar to the one at Mamel is one of the noteworthy objects in the temple. A local story has it that the ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Suket, in whose territories the area fell, was pressuring local people to join the British forces during the Second World War. The people were reluctant to do so, and felt it was the intervention of the goddess that ended the war and saved her people from being slain. An annual fair celebrates the event. Dushera is another major celebration in the temple and several buffaloes are sacrificed. The hill of Shikari Devi (3359 m) stands as a divider between the Karsog and Janjheli valleys. From both, a steep hike leads to the top. The route is through thick woods that have trees of deodar ( Himalayan cedar), spruce, fir and walnut – and several rare herbs. From Chindi, the trail rises just after the village of Bakrote and guides and ponies can be hired for the trail. From Bakhrote, you can drive along the initial couple of kilometres. The top provides a view of the entire area. The area is a wildlife sanctuary that hosts the musk deer, ghoral, bears and a variety of pheasants and other birds. Small huts of the migrant Gaddi and Gujjar people lie along the trail and in spring and again in late autumn you can see them moving with their flocks of cattle. As in practically every other part of Himachal, temples abound in the Chindi-Karsog area. There are several dedicated to the deity Nag Dhamooni who is especially worshipped by childless couples – some of the more attractive structures are at Sairi Bangla ( Bungalow ) and at Saranda. Again near Chindi and accessed by an attractive drive through pine woods that gradually give way to deodars, the temple of Mahunag is regarded as one of the most important in the area. This is considered the core temple of the deity Mahunag, who embodies Karna of the epic Mahabharata. local deitiesA little off the drive to Mandi lies the village of Pangana, which was the original seat of the rulers of Suket, until they shifted the capital to Sundernagar. The centuries-old Devi Kot temple is one of the most remarkable examples of traditional architectural skills. Its wood mesh, packed with dressed stone, rises six stories to approximately fifty feet. The deity Mahamaya and the deified princess of Suket, Chandravati are enshrined in the compound. Past Pangana, and through thick forests and little villages the road winds down to Chail Chowk and the road to Manali. En route and accessible from the village Chowki, after an uphill hike of half a dozen kilometres through thick woods, lies the temple of Kamrunag. For centuries, this temple has been held in high veneration. Through all this time the offerings of gold, silver, ornaments and coins have been dropped in the small lake that lies in front of the temple. Places to Visit near Karsog Valley Shikari Devi thumb Shikari Devi Temple is near to Karsog valley. Shikari Devi Temple is situated at the height of 3359m.

It is a 501(c)3 non-profit philanthropic organization made up of professional women of all ages, races and religions. The Atlanta Woman’s Club is part of the Georgia Federation of Women’s Clubs, as well as the General Federation of Women's Clubs. The Georgia Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC Georgia) is a state organization composed of 150 women's clubs throughout the State of Georgia, whose members provide volunteer service to their communities. Each Club sets their own agendas and works on projects and programs that address the specific needs of their communities. Members of all ages have opportunities for personal growth and enrichment through leadership training and development. Every Georgia clubwoman is also a member of the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC). The General Federation of Women’s Clubs is an international philanthropic organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. The General Federation of Women's Clubs is the oldest, non- denomination, non-partisan, largest international service organization of volunteer women in the world with a membership of 10 million worldwide, in 40 countries.  Club History  As quoted by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Roslyn Carter in their foreword in “A Light on Peachtree: A History of the Atlanta Woman’s Club - “Many in Atlanta may not realize that our city and the state of Georgia could have faced a very different history had it not been for the successful advocacy and funding of several important projects undertaken by the Atlanta Woman’s Club, most notably with the inception and development of the Atlanta airport ...” The Atlanta Woman’s Club was formed in 1895 following a meeting of the Cotton States Exposition in Piedmont Park. The council of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs (GFWC) was in held Atlanta and Rebecca Douglas Lowe was present at this meeting. Following the meeting at Piedmont Park in the fall of 1895, Mrs. Lowe gathered together a group of interested ladies in her home. After this gathering, the Atlanta Woman’s Club was formed and Mrs. Lowe was elected its leader. In 1896, Mrs. Lowe invited 17 other women’s clubs to meet and form the Georgia Federation of Women’s Clubs. She became the President of the GFWC Georgia in 1897. She ultimately went on to serve as the president of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs (GFWC)from 1898-1902. The Atlanta Woman's Club's first home was in Mrs. Lowe’s home. The Club then moved to the DeGive Opera House in downtown Atlanta, which was also known as the Loew's Grand Theatre. In 1910, the Atlanta Woman's Club purchased its first home, which was the Christian Science building located on West Baker Street at the intersection of Peachtree Street and West Peachtree. The Atlanta Woman’s Club remained in that home until 1920 at which time they moved to The Wimbish House in Atlanta, Georgia. =History by the Decades= The early 1900s was known as the Gilded Age and widespread economic growth pushed the U.S. ahead of Britain, especially through heavy industry like factories, railroads, and coal mining. These businesses were powered by a cheap underclass of laborers, many of whom were small children. When the first Club President Rebecca Lowe encouraged the Club to look into areas of needed reform, GFWC clubwomen of this era responded by working for a public kindergarten, better working conditions, the enactment of child labor laws, and the creation of night schools for child factory workers. The General Federation of Woman’s Club expressed at the time “So long as children six years of age are employed in mills and factories can any woman’s club say it has no responsibility?” At the same time clubwomen continued to broaden their own educational opportunities and those of community by hosting a variety of educational lectures and programs on topics from sociology, to taxation to the arts. The Atlanta Woman's Club became part of the greater efforts of the Georgia Federation of Women's Clubs to support education in Georgia’s mountainous regions and supported the establishment of the Tallulah Falls School in 1909. According to one early Club member, “The decline in gossip is really startling. Not so much that we are better than we used to be, but just haven’t the time.” In the second decade of the 1900s the Club became increasingly concerned about drug abuse and juvenile justice. The club campaigned against drugs, worked with prisoners in the city stockade and women's jail, and campaigned against the exploitation of minors. The GFWC clubwomen were so effective that the New York Times commended them for their ability to work quietly behind the scenes in getting their men folk to bring about social reform such as ending the evil system of leasing convicts. The Club created a good roads committee, worked towards the establishment of a Municipal employment Bureau, and formed a committee to censor motion pictures for children. They promoted peace efforts in Europe, but once World War I broke out, they worked tirelessly to improve conditions for American soldiers abroad by preparing medical kits and encouraging the sale of war bonds. However, in the early 1900s women were still barred from all state supported institutions of higher learning, had yet to receive the vote, and were obviously not making decisions about war and peace. After two decades of work on behalf of child laborers there was finally legislation requiring children between the ages 8 and 14 to attend school at least 3 months a year. Although the Club focused heavily on equal education for women, it generally avoided overt support of the suffragettes of this era. Georgia’s agricultural economy was changing at this time from a cotton based economy to fruits and vegetables. The clubwomen supported this by creating the idea of local curb markets to sell Georgia produce and the Sweet Auburn Curb Market, known today as the Municipal Market was formed and still thrives today. In the 1920s the Atlanta Woman’s Club’s membership rose to over 1,000 members. During this time the GFWC clubwomen opposed an effort to exclude Catholic teachers from public schools, they put together the Atlanta Woman's Club Cookbook 1921 that was distributed all over the world, they started a university for homemakers teaching home economics and providing a playroom downtown to take care of children, and in a meeting initiated by the Atlanta Woman’s Club president in 1925 with the Mayor of Atlanta, the club president urged the City to purchase a landing field south of Atlanta. That landing field is now the busiest airport in the world and has led the city to become the vibrant business center that it is. In the 1930s the speculation of the 1920s caught up with reality resulting in the Great Depression. Of course this created additional opportunities for philanthropy and social service, but the cost of club work and the members’ financial conditions were also of concern. The Atlanta Woman's Club members were thrifty and managed to continue to work on a wide variety of projects. They worked to widen the outlet for Georgia Farm goods by staging an exposition of Georgia grown products at the Atlanta city auditorium and sponsored plant sales at the farmers market to help women from rural areas with an additional source of income. AWC club women also continued to sponsor programs to educate themselves and the community about family finance as women became more responsible for supplementing for providing family income. The Atlanta Woman’s Club celebrated the success of their efforts to get women admitted to University of Georgia and included as doctors at the State Hospital for the mentally ill. In 1935 when President Roosevelt visited Georgia, the Atlanta Woman's Club president served on the welcoming committee. The Club was also behind a committee to plant an eventual 1,000 dogwood trees in the city of Atlanta. The Club became the venue for the Atlanta Writers Club, and presented a variety of charity performances in the auditorium to benefit the needy. The decade of the 1940s marked the 50th anniversary of women's clubs. Women across the country celebrated. As another war in broke out in Europe, clubwomen emphasized peace and helped members to learn more about international affairs. The Atlanta Woman’s Club participated in GFWC’s campaigns to finance America's military needs. A “buy a bomber” campaign across the women’s clubs of the country brought in an astounding $101 million. $154 million was raised to finance an air Armada for the Navy. The Atlanta Woman's Club members donated 568,000 hours of service to the defense effort. When the war ended, the Club participated in efforts to support veterans, as well as other initiatives to continue to support preschool training for children, support for Georgia products, conservation, and preservation of the States Forests, and the arts. With the Kennedys in the White House and war temporarily over, the Arts seemed to capture the interest of The Atlanta Woman’s club members in the 1950s. The Club members presented both a play and vocal performance highlighting the history of the Club. They offered programs related to music, opera, writing, antiques, and art. But still had serious concerns. Club members became interested in helping the mentally, physically and developmentally disabled. They promoted the early use of seat belts, and continued their focus on juveniles by advocating their release out of Georgia prisons. They supported the passage of the Fugitive Fathers bill, and pushed for the development of programs for rehabilitating prisoners. As always they continued to focus on to Talullah Falls School and supported a plan to modernize the school by adding a President's House, an athletic field, and modern classroom buildings. The 60's was an era of uneasiness with concerns about assassination, civil unrest and the war in Vietnam. GFWC clubwomen’s work reflected this with support and concern for veterans, help for the needy, and emphasis on international relations. The plight of the Native Americans and preservation of Native American culture was also a national issue at that time and the GFWC held a meeting with a prominent Indian Affairs Officer to learn more. Although the Atlanta Woman’s Club members were progressive in many ways, and in spite of GFWC’s diversity motto, in the era of Jim Crow, the Club was segregated. A similar club for African American women Atlanta Federation of Negro Women’s Clubs existed at this time. Today, the Club enjoys a very diverse membership. The 1970s were challenging for the women's clubs. More vocal champions of women's liberation were effecting change throughout the country through protests and marches, whereas GFWC club members were used to working through legislative and other more traditional avenues. But the times were changing and the Georgia Federation of Women's Club president showed up at her installation banquet wearing of all things... a pantsuit! Many women continued to believe that the Atlanta Woman’s Club’s headquarters, Wimbish House, located in downtown Atlanta was dangerous and the membership grew smaller and older. Nonetheless, the Club continued to pursue its mission, including supporting Bicentennial events, raising money for a chapel at Tallulah Falls School, and working to save the historic Fox Theater from destruction. In the 1980s among the GFWC club projects in this era were getting safety crossing arms installed on school buses, getting the legislature to pass the first child restraint law, getting stricter DUI laws, and stopping a bill that would allow motorcyclists to forgo helmets. The 1990s were a despairing decade for the Atlanta Woman's Club. The club headquarters, The Wimbish House was broken into and irreplaceable antiques were stolen. Shortly after, a fire destroyed part of the house. Although the Atlanta Woman's Club members were emotionally drained by these events, but with Scarlett O'Hara determination, the sturdy members decided that if they could save the Fox Theatre they'd better save the Grand Old Lady of Peachtree. The House was rebuilt under the watchful eyes of architect Zachary Henderson who specialized in restoration of older homes.

From 1 July 302 to 1 July 305, Anullinus was the Proconsular governor of Africa Proconsularis.Chastagnol, p. 45 During his time there, he implemented the edicts against the Christians as decreed by the emperor Diocletian. He travelled across the province, stopping at towns and holding judicial hearings, and enforcing the letter of the law.Shaw, p. 593 He ordered the execution of Felix, Bishop of Tibiuca, who refused to hand over copies of the Christian scriptures to the authorities.Rees, p. 62A.

Ultimately, however, he attempted to maintain some balance between convincing the imperial courts of his adherence in enforcing their decrees, and convincing the local population that he was doing his job only to the limited extent that was necessary, and not so zealously that it would impact his ability to govern the province peacefully.Shaw, p. 503 Regardless, after the persecutions were over, the monuments and buildings erected by him during his time as governor were purposely defaced by the local Christians.Shaw, p. 208 In 306, Anullinus was appointed praefectus urbi (urban prefect) of Rome, a post he held from 19 March 306 to 27 August 307. Although he was appointed by the emperor Severus, he eventually abandoned Severus and conspired with the Praetorian prefect and the tribunus fori suarii of the Cohortes urbanae, Lucianus, to install the Roman usurper Maxentius.Chastagnol, pp. 46-47; Potter, pp. 346-347 Maxentius later appointed Anullinus Urban Prefect for a second time, apparently as an attempt to garner good fortune prior to his upcoming clash against his rival, Constantine I.Potter, David, The Unity of the Roman Empire in From the Tetrarchs to the Theodosians: Later Roman History and Culture, 284-450 CE (ed.

It is an open pit operation which began operations in March 2010, but still managed to produce 13,952,600 ounces of silver that year. Estimated reserves for the Peñasquito Mine are 17.82 million oz of gold, 1,070.1 million oz of silver, 3,214 tons of lead and 7,098 million tons of zinc. The mine has its own radio station, XHESP-FM 98.9 \\"Radio Peñasco\\". Geology The country rock consists of Mesozoic sediments that were deposited in the Basin of Mexico (Mexico Geosyncline). These sediments were intruded by quartz-feldspar porphyries, quartz monzonite porphyries, and other feldspar-phyric intrusives in the late Eocene to the mid-Oligocene, which form sills, dikes, and stocks. The primary ore for the Peñasquito Polymetallic Mine is in two diatreme breccias, named the Peñasco and the Brecha Azul. The mineralization contains gold, silver, lead and zinc. The diatremes flare upward, and are filled with brecciated country rock and intrusions. The rock surrounding the diatremes contain disseminated galena, sphalerite and sulfosalts within phyllic (sericite–pyrite–quartz) and proplytic (chlorite–epidote–pyrite) hydrothermal alteration envelopes.

It was annexed by the City of Ashland in 1905. Previously, Normal was an independent community with post office. Normal Presbyterian Church, founded in 1890, is one of the last surviving remnants of the original community of Normal. The originally wooden church was razed in 1957 when the current brick structure was completed across 44th Street. The Normal Post Office was in operation from Normal was named after the Eastern Kentucky Normal School, a teachers school that was opened here in 1867, by Mrs Mordecai Williams, wife of the original landowner of the community. Mordecai Williams was an Iron master who owned 600 acres of land of the present day area of Normal, from Cliffside Branch to Haney Branch at the Catlettsburg city limits. His stately residence is still standing at Normal, a brick mansion of Colonial style, located on U.S. Routes 23 and 60 at the Catlettsburg-Ashland City Limits. Williams wife operated the Normal School from the home from 1878 to 1889. It is one of the oldest homes in the entire area and has long served as landmark to the community. Most residential zones in this section of the city have been transferred to commercial and industrial zones. Cintas Corporation operates a large facility in the former Washington Avenue section located east of the CSX railroad tracks. The community originally grew up around the coke plant built and operated by Semet Solvay and later owned by Armco/AK steel. The Normal coke plant was in operation from 1891 until it was finally closed due to its inability to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations in July 2011. The only concentrations of residential dwellings remaining in Normal are along Blackburn Avenue (also known as 45th Street), Daniels Street, and from Chestnut Avenue south to the Catlettsburg city limits, which is also known as Williams Addition.

Sydney Electric Lighting Station  The power station was built by the Electric Lighting Department of the Municipal Council of Sydney, and began operations in 1904 as the Sydney Electric Lighting Station. The original equipment included three Ferranti cross compound reciprocating steam engines, one of 500 horsepower (hp) and two of 1,000 hp, each of which drove a three-phase alternator from Dick, Kerr & Co. for a total output of approximately 1,500 kilovolt-amperes (kVA). In 1905, two additional triple expansion 1,000 hp engines coupled to Dick Kerr 600 kW alternators were commissioned, increasing total capacity to approximately 2,700 KW. Steam was supplied by 5 Babcock & Wilcox WIF chain grate boilers, each 10,000 lb/hr at 160 psi. The five reciprocating engines were relegated to emergency use from 1911 and retired in 1916.  Turbo-alternators  Low Pressure Plant:- Two Willans & Robinson - Dick, Kerr turbo-alternators were commissioned in 1907,(Nos 6+7) each with a capacity of 2 MW. Steam was supplied by 4 Stirling boilers whose smoke exhausted to the original chimney. This plant remained in service until 1920, when the two turbo-generators were relocated at Ultimo PS as No3+4 and the four boilers were demolished to make room for the high-pressure plant. In 1909 No 2 engine house was built to the southern side of the original engine house and provided room for more turbines. 2 Willans & Robinson 4 MW reaction turbines were added in 1910(Nos8+9). Another Willans & Robinson 4 MW reaction turbo-alternator was added in 1912(No10). 1 AEG 5 MW impulse turbine was added in 1914(No11). This turbo alternator had a short life and was replaced. Steam was supplied by 6 Babcock & Wilcox coal-fired watertube boilers; each produced 24,000 lb per hour(1908) and in 1913 another 6 boilers each producing 27,000 lb/Hr at 160 psi in Boiler House No2. These boilers were natural draft and exhausted into two large chimneys. The resultant lack of efficient combustion meant that the pollution(black smoke) from the stations' three chimneys was very bad. Total station capacity was increased to 14.7 MW including the reciprocating engines. In 1915 two Babcock+Wilcox cross drum forced draft boilers each with an output of 40,000 lb/hr and a 5 MW AEG generator(No11) were added. The low pressure plant remained in service until 1937 when other power stations (Bunnerong) came on line. High Pressure Plant:- In 1919, engine house No 1 was stripped of the reciprocating plant to allow the installation of larger turbines. One Metro-Vickers 8 MW generator was added in 1921,(No15). Two Metro-Vickers 12 MW generators were added in 1922,(Nos 13+14). One Fraser+Chalmers 12 MW generator(No17) and 1 Thompson 17.5 MW machine,(No16) were added in 1924. Steam was supplied by 8 Babcock + Wilcox, balanced draft, cross drum boilers each producing 65,000 lb/hr at 250 psi and 630 °F in Boiler House No3, to the north of the original building. 'A' Station capacity had increased to 75 MW by 1924 (excluding the decommissioned reciprocating engine-driven plant). The 1904-1924 installation became known as Pyrmont 'A' Station as the site was expanded. This plant was retired in 1956 when Pyrmont \\"B\\" was put into commercial production.  Direct current supply  Dynamotors were provided in at Town Hall and Lang Park to supply direct current to customers. Alternating current was adopted as the new standard from 1930, although the first AC substation did not come into use until 1935. The AC system was not completed until c. 1958. No new DC customers were accepted after 1935, but the existing supply continued, albeit with mercury-arc rectifiers in later years, until 1985.  Sydney County Council  In 1936, all functions of the Electricity Department of the Municipal Council of Sydney were transferred to a new body, known as the Sydney County Council (SCC), which was formed in 1935. The Sydney County Council would be responsible for the supply of electricity to numerous constituent municipalities in the greater Sydney region. The constituent municipal councils elected and controlled the new body. This arrangement continued until 1952, when the SCC's generation responsibilities were transferred to the Electricity Commission of New South Wales.  Pyrmont 'B' Station  By the late 1930s, the first turbo-alternators were nearing the end of their useful lives, and it was decided to redevelop the power station in 1938. In 1942, the SCC accepted the tender of Australian General Electric to supply a single 50-megawatt (MW), 50 Hz turbo-alternator manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Limited of Trafford Park, Manchester, England; the order was confirmed in 1944. This order was doubled in 1945, then doubled again in 1947, to a total of four 50 MW Range-units. These units generated current at 33 kV, which was also the transmission voltage, as there was no room for step-up transformers. Steam was supplied by 4 International Combustion Limited 'Lopulco' Pulverised fuel boilers each producing 430,000 lbs of steam per hour at 1250 psi and 950 °F. Delayed by a post-Second World War backlog, the first 50 MW turbo-alternator arrived from England in 1948, but the new building designed to house it, construction of which commenced in 1947, was not ready. The first of the 50 MW units was not commissioned until 1952, five years behind schedule, and the fourth unit was in service by 1955. When completed in 1955, Pyrmont 'B' was rated at 200 megawatts, making it the largest of the five power stations which existed in the inner Sydney area. Bunnerong Power Station, also formerly operated by the SCC, was much larger, but outside the inner city area. Pyrmont became an emergency generator from the 1970s onwards, as newer power stations were brought into use. 'B' Station was decommissioned in 1983 (along with White Bay Power Station). The station had little more than twenty years in regular use, and ten years as a peak loader or on stand by.  Electricity Commission of New South Wales  From 1936 to 1952, Pyrmont was run by the Sydney County Council (SCC), which had assumed control of the Municipal Council of Sydney's generating assets. The Electricity Commission of New South Wales, formed in 1950, took control of Pyrmont on 1 January 1952, becoming its third and final operator.  Demolition  After remaining derelict for almost a decade, the power station site was redeveloped as the Star City Casino (now \\"The Star\\"), which was opened in 1995 with a gala opening featuring an outdoor performance by Diana Ross. Part of the 'A' Station facade remains at the Star City Casino site, but the much larger 'B' Station structure was demolished in 1993.

The company has presence in Sweden, Singapore and Indonesia, with its headquarters located at Banyuwangi East Java Indonesia. North Sea Boats was founded in 2003 by John and Lizza Lundin as a trading name for PT. Lundin Industry Invest. History John Lundin grew up with boats, as his father Allan Lundin founded the Swedeship company which operated shipyards including Gotland shipyard and Djupvik Shipyard in Sweden. After the Swedish shipyard crisis the Swedeship company was the largest privately owned boat building company in Sweden. It was through Swedeship that John first came to Indonesia in the mid 1990s to investigate the company's expansion opportunities. Allan Lundin died from cancer in 1996, and Swedeship was sold. However the family dream of a shipyard in Indonesia still remained, so John and his Indonesian wife Lizza moved there permanently. After some years of small-scale furniture manufacturing to gain experience of the business culture there, they founding the boat building company North Sea Boats in 2003. Products The boats are constructed using modern composite production techniques such as dual surface vacuum core resin infusion. All materials used are LLoyds / DNV Class Approved, and include carbon composite fibre and E Glass multi-axial non-woven stitched re-inforcings and Vinyl Ester resins. The various models incorporate \\"open architecture\\" deck plans that can be configured to perform multi-role tasks in a broad range of operational environments. They can be powered by inboard diesel engines, outboard motors or by transom drives and waterjets. = X3K = A 63 meter long carbon composite63m FMPV Trimaran - Stealth Fast Missile Patrol Vessel stealth trimaran missile ship. The Indonesian Navy ordered the first of four for delivery starting in 2012. The first of these was named KRI Klewang (hull number 625) and was launched on 29 August 2012; however, only four weeks later the ship caught fire on 28 September while undergoing fit-out in Banyuwangi, and was completely destroyed. A replacement 63 m Trimaran is now under construction in Banyuwangi, and is expected to be launched in early 2016. In the interim period, advances in infusable vinylester resin chemistry have seen the incorporation of nano particles into the resin. These particles aid the transfer of the resin through the carbon/glass fibre matrix and allow the use of fire retardant grade vinylester for infusion. This makes the carbon fibre composite structure of the new vessel self-extinguishing.Jakarta Post: Navy vessel catches fire in Banyuwangi (28 September 2012). X3K trimaran = Bonefish USV = Saab and PT Lundin (North Sea Boats) revealed a mockup of a trimaran Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) at Indo Defence 2014. It was formally unveiled by Indonesia's defence minister General (ret.) Ryamizard Ryacudu and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Marsetio in a joint ribbon-cutting ceremony on the first day of the show. Development of the Bonefish demonstrator began at the start of 2014, the concept marrying Saab Australia's mission systems integration expertise with a LOMOcean's trimaran hullform. The mockup was built in approximately six months at PT Lundin's composite boat production facility in Banyuwangi, East Java. Capable of speeds of up to 40kts, Bonefish is designed to incorporate a wide range of sensors, satellite-based control and a modular payload bay to enable role flexibility. Potential missions could include anti-piracy, maritime surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures, search and rescue, and hydrography. = X2K = The 10.3 X2K Range and the 11.3 m X2K RHIB ( Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat ) Range of models incorporate a double stepped hull design that is based on an offshore race boat design from Sweden. It is a high performance model capable of speeds in excess of 50 knots. There are several X2K variants in production, which include: *Sports / Fishing - centre console recreational model *VIP Transfer - with an enclosed cabin for passenger transfers *Dive - configured for diving, or as a work boat. *Interceptor - designed for patrol and fast interception. *Sports RHIB - centre console recreational model *Special Forces / Operations RHIB - serving military and law enforcement roles. *Interceptor RHIB - designed for patrol and fast interception. *SAR / Pilot / Work RHIB - configured for Search & Rescue, Pilot and work boat roles. = X10 RHIB = The X10 is a 10.5 m RHIB model with a Deep \\"Vee\\" hull design.

It is ideally suited for passenger transfers, diving, conservation, patrol, and combat operations. It can also be used for law enforcement, medical evacuations and rescue operations. = Tankboat = The X18 Tank Boat is an innovative, fast, stealthy, and highly maneuverable catamaran design that provides a stable weapons platform for close-in and long range direct fire support in normally inaccessible coastal and riverine Environments. Fitted with high performance diesel engines and water jet propulsion, the twin hull configuration has excellent sea keeping properties and the added advantage of shallow draft. Giving it the ability to execute beach and river landings and insert or extract squads of up to 20 Special Forces or Marines. The X18 Tank Boat has a crew of 6, and will also carry a High-speed Interdiction RIB for boarding and SEAL insertion. The main weapon system of the X18 Tank Boat is the CMI Defence Cockerill 3105. This system is based on a versatile and powerful high-pressure low recoil-force 105mm gun. Fully stabilised, accurate by day or night, and able to use a wide range of NATO standard 105mm ammunition, this weapon system directly engages a broad spectrum of targets at up to 5,000m range, and indirectly engages targets to 10,000m range. The powerful, accurate and flexible Cockerill C3105 weapon system gives the X18 Tank Boat Commander a wide range of tactical options at all stages of his mission. The 105mm is also capable of firing the Cockerill Falarick 105 Gun Launched Anti-Tank Guided Missile (GLATGM). Elevating to +42° the weapon delivers exceptional engagement capability in complex situations, and the GLATGM permits hard and Point target to be engaged at extended ranges (up to 5 km). The mounting of this type of system allows for flexibility in logistics with the various calibres already in common use with NATO and other major military powers. This is the first time that any company has conceived of mounting this type of system aboard a small, fast and stealthy catamaran that with only a 1-meter draught makes it ideally suited for the confines of coastal waterway operations.

Commissioned in 1899, it was the first major power station in Sydney and was originally built to supply power for the electric tram network. Prior to this, a small installation had existed at Regent Street, which was brought into use on 15 June 1882. Additionally, experimental electric tram operations powered by small generators had been in intermittent use in Sydney since 1890. Generating plant Ultimo Power Station boasted a mixture of equipment, initially consisting of American-made steam engines coupled to dynamoelectric machines (direct current generators). Later generating units were British-made turbo-alternators. Most of the alternating current (AC) equipment operated at 6,600 volts, 25 cycles per second. =Direct current plant – 600 V= The original generating plant at Ultimo consisted of four cross-compound, reciprocating steam engines supplied by E.P. Allis & Co of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, each rated at 1250 horsepower (hp) and running at 100 rpm. HP cylinder diameter was and LP cylinder diameter was . Steam pressure was . Each steam engine was coupled to a multi-pole, compound-wound dynamo supplied by the General Electric Company (GE) of Schenectady, New York. Each dynamo (generator) was rated at at 550 volts direct current (1545 amperes) and could be overloaded by up to 50 percent to satisfy peak demand. To cater to the growing demand of the electrified tram network, the engines were frequently run at . Each tram had less than worth of motors, but the original installation did not allow for growth. It followed that expansion of the power station beyond the initial four units was planned from the beginning. Steam was initially supplied by 14 horizontal multi-tubular under-fired (Colonial) fire tube boilers by G. & C. Hoskins, Sydney. Each was rated at and operated at a pressure of . The boilers were hand fired and had natural draught to a single chimney at the end of the building. Only twelve boilers were needed to provide sufficient steam for full-capacity power generation, leaving two in reserve. The original generating units were removed in 1915 and 1916, but some of the boilers were retained (see below).The Story of Electrical Energy by Brian Maher =First alternators – 6600 V, 25 Hz= The George St tram line experienced serious voltage drop problems, especially at the Circular Quay end. To fix this situation Alternators were brought into use from 1902, starting with three 1500 kW/6.6 kV units supplied by GE. Each alternator was powered by an Allis Reynolds vertical cross compound condensing reciprocating steam engine rated at 2500 hp at 75 rpm. HP cylinder diameter was and the LP cylinder diameter was with a stroke. The 40-pole alternators generated three phase current at 25 Hz. Alterations to the boiler house at this stage saw six of the original boilers removed. Then eight Babcock & Wilcox long-drum, chain- grate boilers were added. Steam pressure was and superheaters gave a final temperature of . As more generators were installed an additional 24 new boilers from Babcock & Wilcox (UK), each rated at 450 hp at 160 lb/sq in were added. By 1904 a total of thirty two B&W; boilers were then on site. Provision (foundations) was made for the addition of three more reciprocating steam engine-alternator sets, but this was abandoned in favour of turbo-alternators. Vertical engine nos 5, 7 and 9 were removed between 1912 and 1914 to allow the addition of turbo-alternators. =Turbo-alternators – 6600 V, 25 Hz= The first turbo-alternator was brought into use at Ultimo Power Station on 9 January 1905(No6)Supplied by C.A. Parsons & Company of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. The steam turbine was rated at 3000 hp, ran at 1500 rpm and drove an 1875 kW alternator at 50 Hz. The steam was raised in 16 new Babcock & Wilcox (UK) boilers, installed in 1905, bringing the total number of boilers on site to 48. These boilers were placed on top of the 32 original boilers. Two additional turbo-alternators were brought into use in 1909. Supplied by C.A. Parsons & Company, each was rated at 5000 kW with an overload capacity of 7500 kW and generated three phase alternating current at 25 Hz. They were numbered 10 and 12. Twelve new Babcock & Wilcox (UK) superheated boilers were added in 1910, and another 8 were added in 1913. They were also placed on top of the original boilers. The remaining eight fire-tube boilers were removed in 1912/13 to make room for coal bunkers. In 1911 a 5 MW 25 Hz Willans Dick-Kerr turbo-alternator was installed with a similar 5 MW machine added in 1913. These machines replaced the vertical generators and were numbered 5 and 8. In 1912, a Dick, Kerr turbo-alternator rated at 7.5 MW 25 Hz, with an overload capacity of 10.5 MW was brought into use at Ultimo as unit No.7. This machine had originally been intended for installation at White Bay Power Station, and it was later transferred there in 1918. In 1914 another Dick Kerr 8.7 MW 25 Hz set was installed as No9. Two 2.3 MW Dick Kerr alternators(ex Pyrmont) were added in 1919 and numbered 1+2. When the DC section was finally closed down in 1920, the remaining horizontal engines were replaced with two more 2.4 MW Dick-Kerr 50 Hz turbo alternators and numbered 3 & 4\\\\. Also, five rotary converters were installed to supply the required DC power. In 1921 it was decided that Ultimo would only generate 25 Hz power. The four small 50 Hz turbo generators were removed, with the last set removed in 1928. The first turbo generator (No. 6) was removed in 1922. =High-pressure turbo- alternators= In 1929, work began to replace the 58 small boilers with six larger boilers operating at and rated at 90,000 pounds of steam per hour. Steam outlet temperature was . The new boilers were the first to burn pulverised coal in any power station in New South Wales. Flue gasses were directed up the two brick chimneys built in 1902. Accompanying the new boilers were two 20 MW AGE-BTH turbo-alternators. They were numbered 1 and 2. This work was completed in 1931. In 1941, two more Babcock + Wilcox High Head boilers rated at 90,000 pounds of steam per hour, operating at a pressure of and , were brought into use. They had a balanced draught system and were fitted with chain grate stokers, and their flue gasses were taken away by two new short steel stacks. This was followed in 1942 by the commissioning of a third BTH 20 MW turbo-alternator(No4). In 1948, the two 5000 kW Parsons turbo- alternators Nos 10 and 12 were removed. In 1949, their space was taken by a single 18.75 MW unit manufactured by English Electric (Australia), which had been alternator No.4 at White Bay Power Station since 1924. This 18.75 MW set became No.3 at Ultimo and went into production about 1951. This brought the total installed capacity of Ultimo to its maximum of 79.5 MW. In 1948/49 the boilers were modified to allow the burning of furnace oil owing to coal supply shortages. Control of Ultimo Power Station was transferred from the Department of Railways, New South Wales to the newly formed Electricity Commission of New South Wales on 1 January 1953. =The Sydney Railway and Tramway Power Grid= The Sydney railway and tramway power grid consisted of Ultimo and White Bay Power Stations, which were linked by a 6600 V transmission network and fed railway and tramway sub-feeder stations. Following the initial 600 V direct current (DC) installation, Ultimo Power Station supplied three phase alternating current (AC) at 6600 V, 25 cycles per second. Originally, this current was not stepped up for transmission. Rotary converters were used to convert the three phase AC to 600 V DC for the tram supply. The 1500 V DC heavy rail electrification commenced operation in 1926 and also initially used high capacity rotary converters. A 25–50 Hz frequency changer was installed at White Bay in 1939, allowing power generated at the two railway power stations to be fed into Sydney County Council's 50 Hz grid as required. The gradual elimination of electric trams from Sydney reduced the demand on the 25 Hz grid. In 1959, it was decided to abandon 25 Hz generation altogether. =Decommissioning= Following the closure of the Sydney tram network in 1961, Ultimo Power Station was decommissioned in 1963. The building was later recycled as the Powerhouse Museum, and more details of its history are provided there.  Engineering heritage award  The power station received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

Early life  Felice Bauer was born in Neustadt in Upper Silesia (today Prudnik), into a Jewish family. Her father Carl Bauer (c. 1850–1914) was an insurance agent, her mother Anna, née Danziger (1849–1930) was the daughter of a local dyer. Felice had four siblings: Else (1883–1952), Ferdinand (called Ferri, 1884–1952), Erna (1885–1978) and Antonie (called Toni, 1892–1918). In 1899 the family moved to Berlin. Felice began attending a ', a vocational school for commerce, but had to give it up in 1908 because her family could not afford it. From 1909 on, she worked as a stenographer at the Berlin record company Odeon. One year later, she moved to the Carl Lindström Company, a manufacturer of gramophones and \\"Parlographs\\", then the most advanced dictation machines. After a short while she was promoted. She worked in marketing and represented the company at trade fairs. In April 1915 she began working at the . She contributed substantially to the income of her family.  Kafka  Felice met Franz Kafka in Prague on 13 August 1912, when he visited his friend Max Brod and his wife. Brod's sister Sophie was married to a cousin of Felice's; Felice was in Prague on a trip to Budapest to visit her sister Else. A week after the meeting, on 20 August, Kafka entered in his diary: Soon after the meeting he began to send her almost daily letters, expressing disappointment if she did not respond as frequently. He dedicated to her his short story \\"\\" (\\"The Judgment\\", literally: The verdict), which he had written the night of 22 September 1912. They met again for Easter of 1913, and he proposed marriage in a letter at the end of July that year. The engagement took place on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, Sunday 31 May, 1914, in the presence of Kafka's parents and sister Ottla, but was broken a few weeks later, in August. After difficult communication, again mostly in letters, and spending ten days together in Marienbad in July 1916, they met for a second engagement on 12 July 1917, planning to marry soon and live together in Prague. Suffering symptoms of the tuberculosis that was to lead to his death, Kafka broke the engagement again in December that year. She departed on 27 December. She saved Kafka's more than 500 letters to her, which were published as Letters to Felice; her letters to him did not survive. Elias Canetti titled his book on the letters Kafka's Other Trial / The Letters to Felice, referring to Kafka's novel The Trial, which he describes as \\"a novel ... in which Kafka's engagement to Felice is re-imagined as the mysterious and menacing arrest of the hero\\". Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for The New York Times, \\"Kafka's Kafkaesque Love Letters\\" that Kafka's letters have:  Later life  In 1919, she was married to Moritz Marasse (1873–1950), a partner in a private bank in Berlin. They had two children, Heinz (1920-2012) and Ursula (1921–1966). With the rise of the Nazis in the 1930 elections, the family moved to Switzerland, with financial loss. They settled there in 1931 and moved to the United States in 1936. She ran a store selling knitting ware made by her and her sister Else. Her husband died in 1950. In financial trouble due to an illness, she sold her letters from Kafka to the publisher Salman Schocken in 1955. She died in Rye, New York.

In later years the route was extended to run from Hamburg via Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Brno and Vienna to Villach. It was named after the ancient settlement of Vindobona on the site of the modern city of Vienna. Labelled as a EuroCity train connection from 1993, services discontinued in 2014. Since December 2018 there is a daily direct Intercity-Express high-speed train between Vienna and Berlin via Linz, Passau and Erfurt. The name Vindobona is now used for Railjet trains between Prague and Graz via Vienna operated by České dráhy and Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). This route shall be again extended to Berlin from mid-2020. Route DR SVT 137 Vindobona at Berlin Ostbahnhof, 1957 The service began on 13 January 1957 using diesel multiple units classified as Fernschnellzug (FDt 50/51) running from Friedrichstraße station in East Berlin via Berlin Ostbahnhof, Elsterwerda, Dresden Hauptbahnhof, Prague hlavní nádraží and České Velenice/Gmünd to Wien Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof. The FDt trains had already begun running between Berlin and Prague in December 1950, including a through coach connection to Vienna. In 1959 the connection was upgraded as Expresszug (Ext 54/55). From December 1957 the railcars had first and second class sections. The participating companies Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR), Československé státní dráhy (ČSD) and Österreichische Bundesbahnen (ÖBB) operated one train pair daily, meeting in Czechoslovakia. The service was used primarily by West Berliners, diplomats and Scandinavians in transit through East Germany, connecting from the night trains from Copenhagen (Ostsee-Express) and Stockholm (Saßnitz-Express) via train ferry from Warnemünde and Sassnitz resp., and shuttle trains from Zoologischer Garten station in West Berlin. In the dining car, passengers could pay using Deutschark, East German mark, Czechoslovak koruna, and Austrian schilling. In Czechoslovakia trains originally ran on the historic Emperor Franz Joseph Railway line via Tábor to the border with Austria at České Velenice, later rerouted via the first Czech railway corridor to Brno and Břeclav. In the period of \\"Normalization\\" from 1969 onwards, domestic travel within Czechoslovakia was for some years completely forbidden, occasionally restricted to journeys between Děčín and Tábor.ČSD timetables 1967/68, 1969/70, 1975/76 and 1976/77 The original journey via Tábor took over 12 hours to complete from Berlin to Vienna. Later, the mainline via Brno became faster, and the train was rerouted, initially via Havlíčkův Brod and later via Pardubice and Česká Třebová along the Czech international corridor, shortening the journey to 9 hours. In 1975, Wien Mitte station became the terminus due to construction at the Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof. Rolling stock DR VT 18.16.10 at Děčín border crossing Rolling stock was alternately supplied by the railway companies for a period of two years: The DR used a refurbished pre-war DRG Class SVT 137 unit until 1960, succeeded by MÁVAG 495.0 and 498.0 railcars operated by ČSD, and ÖBB 5145 (\\"Blue Lightning\\") DMUs from 1962 to 1964. In 1966 DR introduced its newly engineered VT 18.16 diesel-hydraulic express railcars, apparently rivalling with the West German DB Class VT 11.5. Renamed Class 175 in 1970, these prestigious trainsets became a flagship in the range of DR services. From 1969 to 1972, ČSD operated its recently developed M 296.1 railcars with a top speed of . The Vindobona trains continued to be operated by DMUs until it became evident that they were no longer able to cope in terms of capacity. In 1979 they were replaced by a composition comprising an electric locomotive coupled with individual carriages.Zdeněk Michl: Vindobona, zelpage.cz, 2007 The trains then ran as Durchgangszug (D 275/276) and from 1986 to 1988 services were united with the Hungaria Interexpress train to Bratislava and Budapest, including Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) railcars and Yugoslav Railways (JŽ) through coaches to Belgrade.

Objective  AL-System demonstration Levelling the weight of pre-packaged goods in the food sector, especially those involving viscous or pasty products, places extremely high demands on the reproducible accuracy of filling and portioning systems. In order to achieve this, technical and technological issues as well as product-specific characteristics have to be taken into account. In addition to the aforementioned factors, the requirements on the quality of an end product is a key issue when selecting or implementing a technical process solution. The development of vacuum filling machines has made it possible to fulfill both the technical and the quality-related requirements. In the food sector, moving or transporting fluids is achieved with the aid of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, depending on the type of filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported with the aid of a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing. This is basically a volumetric feed principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems,„Flügelzellenpumpe“, Retrieved August 8, 2012 also known as rotary vane pumps, there are also screw feed systems with feed augers, toothed wheel feed systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum. Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors. They can also be found in some non-food sectors. Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be used for filling pasty and compressible products.  History  The first vacuum filler was developed in the early 1960s. The technology has been refined since then.  Requirements/effects  The pumpability of viscous or pasty products has a key effect on the reliable function of a vacuum filler. Filling products in the food sector can be characterised with the aid of various different properties related to their pumpability (“fillability”). They are either physical characteristics that can be measured directly or they are sensory attributes. ; Gas content/density: The gas content is also called the “air content”. The air content of a fluid is the percentage share of air that enters the fluid during grinding/mixing processes. This can be measured using special apparatus and has a direct relationship to the density of a fluid. ; Compressibility: The compressibility depends on the air content of a fluid. A high level of compressibility is linked to a high gas content in the fluid. ; Viscosity: Viscosity is a measure of the consistency of a fluid. The higher the viscosity, the higher the consistency of the fluid is (it is less fluid); the lower the viscosity, the lower the consistency of it is (more fluid). Highly-viscous filling products in the food processing industry are primarily found in the meat, bakery products and convenience food sectors. These highly- viscous substances are commonly referred to as being “pasty”. The fluidity is the basic requirement for the pumpability of a fluid. The viscosity can also be determined using suitable rheological measuring apparatus. In the food sector, the viscosity is primarily dependent on the fluid content of the filling product. ; Temperature: The temperature is a key factor for pumpability as it has a direct effect on the viscosity as well as on the product quality. ; Texture, fibrousness, dimensions of the inserts: Specific sensory characteristics of a filling product have a significant effect on the assessment of the fillability and compliance with the precise weight. ; Weight accuracy: With the help of modern filling technology in the food sector, accurate portioning with a difference of up to 1% in relation to the required volume of a portion can be achieved.  Mode of operation  conveyor The key element of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the feed system mechanically via a hopper with actively driven feeding auger, as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell feed system move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The feed system moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the feed system. Each cell of the feed system has a particular volume. The portion is defined by the rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor's rotation distance by the number of the feed system cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.  Structure and technical requirements  Vacuum fillers are primarily used in the food trade and in the food industry. Special criteria apply to the design of machines in the food sector due to specific hygiene standards and hygiene regulations. This includes, for example, ensuring that they are easy to dismantle, have level surfaces and seals that can be rinsed from the rear, no dead spaces, ergonomic shapes, a small range of parts and detectable materials/materials suitable for food use. Relatively aggressive ambient conditions, such as reactive detergents, reactive or abrasive filling media, intensive high-pressure cleaning and extreme ambient temperatures, are also faced. Vacuum fillers are therefore made of a high proportion of stainless steel with a very robust design. Moving parts can be easily dismantled and can be cleaned individually. In addition to the mechanical or design-related issues, complex electronic components in a vacuum filler also have to be taken into account. = Vane cell feed system with hopper = hopper with mechanical feeding auger The vane cell feed system mainly consists of a rigid pump housing with attached side plate that is fixed to the pivoting hopper, and a removable rotor with pump vanes and cam. Depending on the machine size there are various different sizes of vane cell feed systems with parts with appropriate dimensions. The hopper can be swivelled to clean and dismantle surfaces and parts that come into contact with filling product. The driven rotor with an appropriate number of slots is located in the pump housing, in which pump vanes form cells with defined volumes when the machine is closed, supported by the cam. Induced by the rotor movement when the machine is started, the cells move in the direction of the vane cell feed system outlet and therefore ensure that a defined product flow is achieved. The weight accuracy of a feed system is partially dependent upon the production precision of the parts and their degree of wear. = Vacuum system = The cells are filled by evacuating the vane cell feed system. By applying a vacuum via a vacuum pump, the filling products are gently drawn out of the hopper into the feed system as soon as an evacuated cell moves underneath the hopper. The vacuum pump is protected by an integrated water separator. The level of vacuum can be set according to the filling product. In addition to the feed effect, the filling product is simultaneously evacuated to a certain extent (approx. 2–4 %). This means that the air content of the filling product decreases and the filling product becomes denser. = Feeding = feeding The term feeding in the context of vacuum fillers refers to actively moving the filling media in the direction of the lower part of the hopper to support the vacuum approach within the hopper. Feeding is achieved by using moveable feeding augers with scrapers/rigid counter arms. The feeding auger is driven in synchronisation with the rotation of the rotors. Due to the special geometry of both augers and the parallel rotation movement, the filling product is moved vertically in the direction of the vane cell feed system. The required feed intensity depends on the viscosity of the media to be filled. Less active feed is needed with low-viscosity media than with high-viscosity product. There are therefore a variety of combinations or versions of the parts involved in the feeding process. = Machine base = The machine base acts as the stand for a vacuum filler. For hygiene reasons, bases are made completely of stainless steel. The compact machine base is designed to ensure that it can be moved easily using lifting equipment. = Lifting device = Lifting devices allow the hopper to be loaded using standard trolleys. They can either be fixed onto the vacuum filler or a mast type lifting device can be positioned separately next to the vacuum filler. Lifting devices can be driven hydraulically or electrically. = Control and drive systems = vacuum filler monitor touch control A computer-aided control system is required for operating the various functions associated with a vacuum filler. Usually, several drives are integrated into the vacuum fillers for the various different applications. With the most modern generations of vacuum fillers, the drives are implemented by means of servo motors and appropriate bus systems. = Sealing devices = To produce individual portions from homogenous product via a feed system, a “sealing device” is always required at the feed system outlet. This device separates portions and is controlled in synchronisation with the portion output. These devices could be linking devices for sausages, clippers for portionable sausages, dosing valves for tubs and cans, cutting devices for dough as well as forming equipment for dumplings. = Other feed system principles = Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be equipped with various different feed systems. However, in principle, the basic machine structure, with a hopper, vacuum system, feeding device, machine base, lifting device, control system and sealing device, is very similar. Depending on the application, each type of feed system has advantages and disadvantages. ; Screw feed system with feed augers: With a screw feed system, two counter-rotating screws form cells within a housing; they are moved in the direction of the pump when the screws are rotated. The filling product is again moved into the screw feed system with the aid of a vacuum and mechanical feeding devices. ; Toothed wheel feed system: An outer toothed ring is driven, rotating an inner toothed wheel with it. The toothed wheels form cell segments as they move against each other. The cell content is transported through the toothing and it is then voided and ejected in the outlet area. ; Feeding via lifting cylinders: Feeding via alternately moving lifting cylinders is the simplest feed system principle. The volume is defined by the geometry of the cylinders, and the portion size is determined by the number of strokes. ; Hopper vacuum systems: The additional creation of a hopper vacuum is a variation of the vacuum filler concept. The vacuum system is enhanced with an additional vacuum pump, specially designed for the hopper. The hopper is closed and is connected to an upstream reservoir. The vacuum present in the hopper allows filling product to be drawn into the filling machine from the reservoir. The filling product is also intensively evacuated.  Range of applications  = Food = ; Meat products: * Cooked, dry and boiled sausage (sausage meat) * Dry and cooked cured products ; Dairy products: * Butter * Cream cheese and cream cheese-based products * Curd * Cheese spread products * Yoghurt ; Fish products: * Fish masses * Caviar ; Vegetable products: * Potato products ; Bakery products: * Fruit bread * Cake mixtures ; Pasta: * Turnovers * Pasta dough ; Confectionery: * Marzipan * Chocolate products * Blancmange-type products ; Delicatessen products: * Soups * Sauces * Spiced marinades * Delicatessen salads * Raw fruit and vegetable products with fibrous inserts * All types of fillings = Chemicals and non- food products = * TNT * Technical sealants  Problems and their solutions  Many problems may occur when filling viscous media. The problems are often product-specific and are revealed when the product to be filled takes on an a-typical appearance. Examples of this are an inhomogeneous product appearance with sausage goods or when inserts are ground too finely during the pumping process. However commercial or legal problems can also arise, in the form of weight deviations or non-compliance with the specified quality regulations (e.g. the guidelines for meat products). These problems are caused by a variety of influences, such as air content or viscosity being too high, insufficient feed volume in the feed system, temperature-related influences and mechanical influences such as friction and fragmentation. The aforementioned problems can be eradicated by modifying upstream process steps, adapting recipes and making technical modifications.  Auxiliary devices  ; Holding devices: Holding devices in the field of sausage production are used for automatic sausage linking. A holding device comprises a rotating linking nozzle and an appropriate sausage casing brake. The movement of the linking nozzle is achieved by a drive integrated into the vacuum filler. The sausage casing brake ensures that the sausage casings are extracted evenly, thus creating equal portions. ; Hanging lines: Vacuum filler hanging line Hanging lines in the field of sausage production are auxiliary devices for linking and hanging portions of sausage. In principle, the application is similar to that of a holding device, however significantly higher filling capacities can be achieved. Hanging lines are available with various different degrees of automation. ; Cutting lines: Cutting lines in the field of sausage production have the same basic structure as hanging lines. Cutting lines are used to chop linked strings of sausages into portioned sausages. ; Clippers: Clippers for the production of portioned sausages are used in conjunction with vacuum fillers. The filling product is taken from the vacuum filler and through a filling pipe connected to the clipper and an appropriate sausage casing brake, where it is portioned into appropriate casings. The portion is then sealed by the clipper with the aid of metal clips. Sometimes, loops for hanging the portions are also attached simultaneously. Strings of sausages as well as individual portions can be produced. ; Forming devices: Forming devices are used for the production of formed products, such as dumplings and burgers. There are two types. With free-forming devices, the filling product is filled via tubing with an attached separating device. The separating device and the portion output are synchronised in such a way that it is possible to form the filling flow. The separating devices can be diaphragms„Diaphragma“, Retrieved August 8, 2012 (which function in a similar way to a photographic iris diaphragm; opening and closing creates a round shape during portioning), forming blades that move against each other or simple wire cutters or blades. The portion is ejected when the separating unit is opened. The separating devices then close in synchronisation with the end of the portion. This synchronised, adjustable process allows various different shapes to be created. The products can be directly transported for packaging or for thermal treatment on conveyor belts. With devices with forming dies, the filling product is filled into forming dies (plastic mould that is filled to the base). The filled mould is “moved” away from the filling area, it is detached from the flow of product by means of a simultaneous clipping movement and then ejected mechanically or pneumatically into transportation containers or into thermal treatment media. ; Co-extrusion systems: Co-extrusion means the synchronous feeding of two or more product flows with the aim of producing filled products (e.g. meatballs with ketchup filling, sausages with mustard filling and potato dumplings with a meat filling). Two or more vacuum fillers are always required. Co-extrusion systems are available for the forming, clipping and linking applications. ; ConPro systems: ConPro systems (continuous production systems) are special continuous co-extrusion systems for producing sausages with alginate skin. With this application, two vacuum fillers are operated in synchronisation and their filling flows are combined into one continuous product flow. Further down the process, the continuous string is divided into individual portions or strings of portions. One vacuum filler pumps the filling product while a second one deposits the skin (a paste containing alginate) via an annular gap. This is solidified by means of a fixing solution containing calcium ions. Depending on the degree of automation, the portions can be hung or collated or transported further for continuous thermal treatment or packaging. The most important advantage of the ConPro systems in comparison to traditional production methods is that sausage skins or casings no longer have to be changed. Due to continuous co-extrusion there are no casing change times and therefore the filling time is maximised. ; Inline grinding systems: In the meat processing industry, grinding systems are used for grinding meat and are to be found ahead of the filling process in the product preparation phase. With inline grinding systems, a grinding system is integrated into the vacuum filler's filling flow as an auxiliary device. The filling and grinding process steps can therefore be combined in a single machine. This means that the filling product is moved by the vacuum filler and, during filling, it is chopped to the final grain size within the grinding system. An important application for inline grinding systems is dry sausage or fresh sausage production. ; Minced meat lines: Minced meat lines are a combination of vacuum fillers, inline grinding systems and devices for separating the minced meat flow into individual portions. A continuous, formed product flow is filled onto a conveyor belt and a cutting blade divides the filling flow into portions. The portions can then be packed straight away. ; Filling flow dividers: A filling flow divider can separate a single product flow from a pump into several equal flows. Feed systems similar to a vane cell feed system are integrated into filling flow dividers. Filling flow dividers are required, for example, for simultaneous depositing into several containers. ; Valves: Valves or cutting devices are used as sealing devices at the end of tubing or filling flow dividers.  Weight control and process documentation  Multi-machine electronic control and documentation systems are used to document a filling process involving vacuum fillers or to monitor filling weights.

By road, Kentrigg is located north of the centre of Kendal and southeast of Burneside. It contains the Carus Green Golf Club, which separates it from Burneside just to the northwest. Across the River Kent to the east is the Shap Road Industrial Estate, north of the district of Mintsfeet and the Mintsfeet Industrial Estate which marks the southeastern side of Kentrigg. The area contains a number of cottages which are let out to tourists. Helsfell Hall was the seat of the Briggs family which dominated the area in the 16th and 17th centuries up to the English Civil War. The old hall today is a Grade II listed building. 109 Burneside Road, also known as Aikrigg End, is a Grade II listed building, dated to the 18th and early 19th century. Kendal Fell lies to west of Kentrigg. History Historically, the Briggs and Philipson (Phillipson) families dominated this area of northwest Kendal, which was under the parish of Kirkbie. A Christofer Philipson of Hollin Hall, near Crook (several miles to the northwest of Kentrigg), is documented in a will dated 20 May 1566 to have given Rolland Phillipson and his male heirs \\"lands I purchased of Mr. Heskett\\" in this area. Around 1581, the son of Robert Philipson married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Briggs of Helsfell Hall and subsequently had five sons and two daughters. During the English Civil War in the 1640s, the Briggs family, who were Parliamentarians (Colonel Edward Briggs was a magistrate), clashed with their cousins, The Philipsons, who were strict Royalists. During the Siege of Carlisle, Colonel Briggs besieged Robert Philipson's Belle Isle on Windermere for eight to ten days. Robert Philipson is documented as having searched Kendal Church for his cousin Edward Briggs while he was at prayers on a Sunday morning with \\"the object of killing his cousin\\" in retaliation. The dominance of the area by the Briggs family ended after the civil war when the Philipsons stripped the family of their possessions, Robert Philipson taking ownership of the Colonel Brigg's seat at Helsfell Hall. The hall is mentioned in Cornelia Nicholson's The Annals of Kendal who documents that the seat of the Briggs family was \\"once a place of considerable importance.\\" Kendal Fell In 1936, 1380 yards of cast-iron and stoneware pipe sewers were built in Kentrigg. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Kentrigg and Burneside became a part of the South Lakeland district, its capital at Kendal. The area has developed in recent decades from farmland with new housing estates and the development of the Mintsfeet Industrial Estate and the Shap Road Industrial Estate, across the River Kent. Tourism For All UK, a notable Cumbrian tourist operator, has their headquarters on the Shap Road estate. The River Mint drains into the Kent near here. South of the industrial estate is a park, known as the Jubilee Playing Fields. Shap Road Industrial Estate A housing development named Kentrigg Walk was developed along the banks of the River Kent in the 1980s, containing 8 large detached houses. In 1994 the Kentrigg West Action Group (KWAG) was formed to object to further housing development of some 300 houses on 15.5 hectares of farmland. The lobbying by the local group managed to reduce the housing development to 150 houses, when a public inquiry in 1996 rejected proposals by the South Lakeland District Council to further develop the Low Sparrowmire fields. In April 2008, the council submitted a new proposal to build 400 houses a year, some 8880 houses in the northwest area of Kendal up to the year 2025. The local Steering Group appealed to MP Tim Farron and local councillors, primarily concerned with the affect the development would have on the area known as the Green Gap, an agricultural strip between Hallgarth housing estate and Carus Green on Burneside Road. More than 210 people signed the petition in support of KWAG. Carus Green Golf Club was established in 1997 when farmer Fred Downham converted his farmland into an 18- hole golf course. The multimillion-pound development created 5 new jobs and has since attracted over 100 members. The Par 70 course measures 5860 yards, and the River Kent, Mint and River Sprint meander across the course. The course is managed by Graham Curtin. Several artefacts were unearthed during the building of the golf course. Landmarks Newer Helsfell Hall Kendal Golf Club course near Kendal Fell Kentrigg House on Burneside Road has been used as the clubhouse of the Carus Green Golf Club since 2011. It hosts golf seminars and product launches, as well as county events, and has a bar, restaurant, function suite and four apartments. Local concerns were raised that the clubhouse might cause disturbances in the area and function as a nightclub, but soundproofing measures have been implemented at the house. 109 Burneside Road, also known as Aikrigg End, is a Grade II listed building. It is dated to the 18th and early 19th century. The roof is hipped with a graduated slate roof and gabled porch on the south side. It is 2 storeys high, with 3 bays and a panelled door. The area also contains numerous cottages which are let out to tourists, such as the Old Woolyard and Low Plumgarths Farmhouse, about a mile from Kentrigg. Architect W. A. Nelson designed two of the houses along Burneside Road.

Early years After attending Barlaeus Gymnasium in Amsterdam, De Casparis started piano study at the conservatory of Amsterdam. However, a year later, in 1934, he turned to classical languages with Russian as a minor at the University of Amsterdam. Barend Faddegon was teaching Sanskrit in Amsterdam and under his influence, de Casparis switched to Sanskrit. In 1935, the archaeologist Willem Frederik StutterheimRobert Heine-Geldern (1946), \\"Obituary: H. H. Juynboll--N. J. Krom --Willem F. Stutterheim,\\" The Far Eastern Quarterly 5(2): 216-218. of the Oudheidkundige Dienst in Nederlandsch-Indië (Archaeological Service in the Netherlands Indies) gave a lecture at the University of Amsterdam at which time he advised de Casparis to transfer to Leiden to continue his studies because the Oudheidkundige Dienst was looking for an epigrapher to replace Roelof Goris. Accordingly, de Casparis registered for Indology at the University of Leiden in 1936. He excelled as a student and quickly passed his examinations in Sanskrit (with Jean Philippe Vogel), Avestan (with J. H. Kramers), archaeology and ancient history (with N. J. Krom), Old Javanese (with Cornelis Christiaan Berg), and Malay (with Ph. S. van Ronkel). Moreover, he forged lifelong friendship with Raghu Vira, Durga Prashad Pandey and Senarath Paranavitana. de Casparis was appointed as Vogel's assistant and in 1939, at the age of 23, graduated. His thesis presented a new interpretation of the Sanskrit inscription of Dinoyo of CE 760. Indonesia and the Second World War On 3 August 1939 De Casparis was appointed epigrapher to the Oudheidkundige Dienst in Batavia. Arriving at the Netherlands Indies, De Casparis was welcomed by Stutterheim and with him toured through Central Java and East Java. After ten months at the Oudheidkundige Dienst in Batavia, however, his position was abruptly terminated. With the imperial Japanese threat, he was called up on 2 July 1940 to serve as a cryptographer in the Dutch colonial army (KNIL) and in the same year Louis-Charles Damais succeeded him as acting epigrapher. In early 1942, the Japanese invaded the Indonesian archipelago and De Casparis was taken prisoner, labouring on the Burmese railway. Together with H. R. van Heekeren, P. Voorhoeve, Chris Hooykaas, his close friend the Sinologist Marius van der Valk, and the Dutch entertainer Wim Kan, he survived the labour camps. By the end of the war De Casparis was fluent in Japanese. For a year after the Japanese surrender, he travelled through Thailand and visited archaeological sites. He stayed in Kanchanaburi, and learned Thai, and studied the inscriptions of Ram Kamhaeng. In August 1946, De Casparis returned to the Netherlands as a second lieutenant in the air force. At this time, some seven years after first meeting his future wife in France while en route to Batativa, he married Gisèle Marie Fongaro, an Italian-born Frenchwoman. Return to Indonesia The Renville Agreement paved the way for de Casparis's return to the archipelago in 1948 and a year later, his wife and young daughter Anna (born 1947) followed him to Jakarta. Damais was reappointed acting epigrapher in 1945, but in September 1947 he returned to France. As of November 1947, August Johan Bernet Kempers headed the Oudheidkundige Dienst and on 17 April 1948, De Casparis again took up his post as epigrapher. On 14 November he defended his PhD thesis on the inscriptions from the Śailendra period at the University of Indonesia in Jakarta. Politically committed to Indonesia's struggle for independence, De Casparis met Sukarno, who showed an interest in archaeology and had established an independent Republican archaeological service (Dinas Purbakala) in Yogyakarta. In 1950, this replaced the Oudheidkundige Dienst. Meanwhile, the Oudheidkundige Dienst had started training Indonesians; R. Soekmono studied with Bernet Kempers who promptly made Soekmono his successor in 1953 after the latter's graduation. Boechari became de Casparis's student in epigraphy. In 1955, de Casparis became professor in the early history of Indonesia and Sanskrit at a branch of Airlangga University (Surabaya) in Malang. In the same year he also gave courses as visiting professor of the history of South and Southeast Asia at Universitas Adityawarman, founded by Mohammad Yamin in Batusangkar, Sumatra. Because of these duties de Casparis stayed in Jakarta for another year before moving to Malang with his family. Return to Europe Anti-Dutch sentiment in Indonesia was mounting and although de Casparis would have liked to become an Indonesian national, for the sake of the education of his three daughters, Anna, Françoise (born 1950), and Claire (born 1952), the family decided to return to Europe in 1958 when he was offered a position as lecturer in the early history of South and Southeast Asia at SOAS. He was promoted to reader in 1961. At SOAS, De Casparis worked with Chris Hooykaas, reader in Old Javanese, on the textual comparison between the Sanskrit Bhattikavya and the Old Javanese Kakawin Ramayana. In 1978 De Casparis returned to Leiden to become professor of the early history and archaeology of South and Southeast Asia at the Department of Languages and Cultures of South and Central Asia (Kern Institute). After 39 years away from the Netherlands, and with a family that did not speak Dutch, he did not feel entirely at home in the formal setting of Dutch academia. Nonetheless his Leiden period was fruitful in terms of publications and the number of students he produced. During his London period, De Casparis had been invited by the University of Hawaii as visiting professor and in 1983 returned to Hawaii to occupy the Burns Chair of History while retaining his Leiden post. After his retirement in 1986 at the age of 70, De Casparis remained active and exercised his right to supervise PhD dissertations to 1991. Many of his students were from Sri Lanka, and this led to his being awarded a Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, by the University of Peradeniya on 22 December 1990. He remained active after his wife died in 1998 and had hoped, in 2000, to return to Indonesia to study the inscriptions at Wadu Paa. He was unable to make the trip, but continued, nonetheless, to work on the inscriptions of Siṇḍok until his death in 2002. De Casparis was a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1957 until 1979, when he resigned.

The genus is solely known from Early Cretaceous, Albian age, fossil amber found in Spain. Currently the genus comprises only a single species Amarantoraphidia ventolina. History and classification Amarantoraphidia ventolina is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen number CES 364.1. The specimen is composed of a mostly complete adult insect with the wing tips missing. The apical third of the right hindwing is also gone and the left front most leg has been disarticulated. The specimen is included in a piece of amber with plant debris and a number of other insects, such as a thysanopteran, hymenopterans. and dipterans. The fossil was recovered from outcrops of the Escucha Formation in Moraza, part of the Province of Burgos in northern Spain. Amarantoraphidia was first studied by group of paleoentomologists led by Ricardo Pérez-de la Fuente of the University of Barcelona and including Enrique Peñalver, Xavier Delclòs, and Michael S. Engel. Their 2012 type description of the new genus and species was published in the electronic journal ZooKeys. The genus name Amarantoraphidia was coined by the researchers as a combination of the snakefly genus Raphidia and the Greek amarantos meaning \\"ageless\\" or \\"that never fades\\". The specific epithet ventolina is a reference to the Cantabrian mythologies ventolines. These were said to be cheerful air beings with warm green wings which helped fishermen when summoned. Amarantoraphidia ventolina is one of six described snakefly species found in the Albian deposits of Cantabria. Description The lone specimen of Amarantoraphidia ventolina is a fairly well preserved adult female. The hyaline forewings are partially preserved, displaying brown vein structuring that hosts robust setae, notably along the C-vein. The forewings are incomplete, with the tip beyond the end of the pterostigma not present. As such the overall length is estimated to have been in length and a maximum of in width. The pterostigma is elongated with a slightly infumate and has a base end closed with a cross vein. Other than the basal cross vein the pterostigma is not crossed by any veins. Overall the legs show a striped pattern of dark and light patches. The tibia have three distinct dark patches while the femora have a light proximal half and darkened apical half. The integument is a dark brown in color. The abdomen is long and sports a robust ovipositor that has dense annulations along its length. The ovipositor is long, thick, and sports short, stiff, sensory setae along its length.

In the 1770 census there were 23 houses in the village. Kleč had a maximum population of 125 in 1880, which gradually decreased due to emigration.Ferenc, Mitja, & Gojko Zupan. 2012. Izgubljene kočevske vasi, vol. 2 (K–P). Ljubljana: Znanstvena založba Filozofske fakultete Univerze v Ljubljani. Before the Second World War, the village had 21 houses and a population of 89. At that time, the economy of the village was based on farming, making wooden tubs, troughs, shovels, and railway ties, selling firewood, lumber, and logs, and gathering berries. There was an inn in the settlement. The original inhabitants were evicted on 23 and 24 November 1941. In August 1942 Italian troops burned the village and now it is difficult to discern the traces of the former houses.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Državna založba Slovenije, p. 224. The village was not rebuilt after the war, and the meadows were used by the Kočevje collective farm. Since about 1990 the farmland has been worked by the Robida family of Stari Log.

Church Site of Saint Andrew's Church The church in Kleč was a chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Andrew. It stood at the southeast edge of the village. It probably dated to the mid-16th century and was mentioned in visitation records dating to 1753. It had a rectangular nave, a painted wooden ceiling, and a vaulted chancel walled on three sides. There was a square stone belfry. The church and its furnishings were burned in 1943.

Lemcke (19 August 1891 – 1955) was a German sculptor who mainly worked in bronze. He produced numerous sculptures for Nazi Germany, including the eagles holding swastikas that flanked the entrance of the Ministry of Aviation in Berlin. He is also remembered as being the designer of the first Olympic Torch, which carried the flame during the 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay. Several of Lemcke's works remain today and are featured in parks and museums around Germany. Works =Nazi eagles= The head of Lemcke's 4.5 m eagle sculpture Lemcke produced numerous pieces that depicted eagles, the national symbol used by the Nazi government. Examples of these works include two large sculptures that featured at the newly built Ministry of Aviation office in Berlin. These eagles added to the Nazi symbolism of the building, themselves gripping swastikas and stood atop decorative columns. At the end of World War II the sculptures were removed from what is now the Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus. Perhaps Lemcke's most significant eagle statue was the one that once stood on the roof of the Berlin Tempelhof Airport. Designed by Ernst Sagebiel and implemented by Lemcke, it stood at 4.5 m and was visible for many miles. Rather than holding a swastika in its claws, this sculpture grasped a large globe to symbolise the international aspect of the airport. The sculpture was cast in iron before being treated to appear bronze. In 1962 the statue was removed to make way for the installation of new radar equipment. The airport was closed in 2008 and the head is now located near to the entrance of the nearby Platz der Luftbrücke. This led to the area being named \\"Eagle Square\\". =Involvement in the 1936 Summer Olympics= Lemcke designed the 27 cm wood and metal torches. German manufacturer Krupp produced 3,840 copies for the runners, over 500 more than would be needed. The shaft of the torch featured an eagle over the Olympic rings. Along with the torch Lemcke sculpted a bell that was struck as part of the opening ceremony. The bell features the inscription \\"\\" (I summon the youth of the world).

According to the legend, Gióng was a boy who rode on an iron horse and won against the enemy of the state.\\"A widow's son, Gióng grows to be a mighty hero and rides a magic horse to victory against a foe and then to the heavens.\\" The most well known version of the legend had him battle against the Chinese army, thus, he is considered the first anti-invasion hero of the Vietnamese. Some researchers believe he is the Vietnamese version of Vaiśravaṇa.

Sơn Tinh – Thủy Tinh, Thánh Gióng.22 The distinction between what is legend and what is scientific history is unclear.\\" Legends There are many versions of the legend of Thánh Gióng. But they all have the same general story: In ancient time, there was a fearsome enemy, the king sent his men to seek for a talented person to defeat the enemy. In Phù Đổng village, there was a child, although he is three years old, but he couldn't talk or crawl. But as soon as he heard about the king seeking for talent, he spoke. He then joined the army, asked the king for a sword and a horse, and defeated the enemy. After peace was restored, he flew away. = Việt điện u linh tập = In Việt Điện U Linh Tập, Thánh Gióng is known as Sóc Thiên Vương (). This version does not specify when the story was set nor who was the enemy. It says in the old days, there was an enemy in the country, the king ordered his emissaries to find some one who can defeat the enemy. The Heavenly King (, which is what Thánh Gióng is called in the story) was a baby at the time. Having heard the news, he told his mother to prepare a lot of food for him. A few months later, he grew into a big man and joined the army. The emissary brought him to the capital. The king was very happy and asked him: \\"What is that that you want?\\" to which the Heavenly King answered: \\"Please give me a long sword and an iron horse.\\" The king accepted. The Heavenly King drew his sword and rode his horse into battle. Once he defeated the enemy and restored peace in the country, he rode his horse to Vệ Linh mountain, climbed onto a banyan tree and fly away. The people erected a temple to worship him. The Lý dynasty also erected a temple dedicated to him in Cảo Hương village near West Lake.Việt Điện U Linh Tập Thiền uyển tập anh has a follow up to the story: In the Early Lê dynasty, Buddhist monk Khuông Việt travelled to Vệ Linh mountain and wanted to build a house there. That night, he dreamt of a deity who wore gold armor, carried a golden spear in his left hand and a tower in his right hand, followed by more than ten people. The deity said: \\"I am Vaiśravaṇa (, ), my escorts are all Yaksa. The Heavenly Emperor sent me to this country to help the people, you are blessed to be able to talk to me.\\" The monk woke up and heard loud cries in the mountain. The next day, he found a large unusual tree in the mountains, he cut it down and built a temple. In 891, the Song dynasty invaded, emperor Lê Hoàn told Buddhist monks to pray at the temple. The Song army at Tây Kết village suddenly retreat to Chi river, they then met with a large storm and withdrew back to China. Lê Hoàn built more temple to Tì Sa Môn Thiên Vương.Thiền uyển tập anh = Lĩnh Nam chích quái = In king Hùng's time, the country was peaceful. The king of Ân planned an invasion under the pretext of punishing king Hùng for not paying tribute. King Hùng asked his men for a way to fight back, one of them said: \\"Why don't we ask the dragon king to fight them for us?\\" The king held a large prayers, suddenly there's heavy rain and an old man appeared. The king thought the man was unusual, and asked him how to fight the invader. The old man predicted that the enemy will invade in three years, and to fight back, the king must \\"forge weapons, train soldiers, and find talents in the country. Those who defeat the enemy will be rewarded with land and title.\\" The old man flew away, the king realized that he's the dragon king. Three years later, the Ân invaded, the king followed the dragon king's advice and sought for talented man. In Phù Đổng village, there's a 60-year-old rich man who had a son. This child was already 3 years old yet he couldn't talk or sit. When the king's emissary arrived to his village, his mom jokingly said: \\"I gave birth to this child who only know how to eat, he doesn't know how to fight the enemy to receive the reward and repay his parents.\\" The child suddenly spoke: \\"Mom, invite the emissary to see what he got to say\\". The emissary arrived and asked the child what did he want, the child answered: \\"Tell the king to forge an iron horse 18 thước high, an iron sword 7 thước long and an iron helmet.\\" The child then grew up very fast. When Ân army arrived at Trâu mountain, the child, now a 10 trượng tall man, stood up.

It was written by Matt Evans, directed by Clive Arnold, and executively produced by Lorraine Newman. It included seven minutes of live footage, during which the character of Billy Mitchell, played by Perry Fenwick, carried the Olympic Torch as an official torch bearer as part of the official torch relay for the London 2012 Olympic Games, and Lola Pearce, played by Danielle Harold, gave birth to her daughter. The storyline for the episode was announced in November 2011, with the fact that Lola would give birth being reported in July 2012. The episode received positive reviews, with Karen Edwards from Heat calling it \\"special\\" and praising Harold's performance, and Jane Rackham from the Radio Times calling it \\"highly topical\\", though Boyd Hilton from Heat felt that Billy's torch bearing was a \\"gimmick\\" and the whole episode should have been live. It was watched by an average of 7.32 million people on its initial broadcast. It was accompanied by a special, one-off BBC Red Button episode called \\"Billy's Olympic Nightmare\\". The episode received an All About Soap award nomination for Best Episode, under the name \\"Billy and the Olympic Torch\\", and a British Soap Award nomination for \\"Spectacular Scene of the Year\\", both in 2013. Plot Selected as a torch bearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) is stuck on the London Underground with members of his local football team because someone pulled the emergency stop when an argument broke out. The train starts but police are waiting at the tube station and will not let them through. Billy manages to escape, and frantically tries to get ready for the torch. Meanwhile, Billy's granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), is in labour in a local fast food restaurant, refusing an ambulance, and refusing to give birth until she knows Billy has carried the torch and can be there. After some delays, Billy is able to carry the torch, watched by his friends and neighbours. He then hears that Lola is in labour, so rushes to the restaurant, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) delivers the baby.

At the same time, it was announced that in reality, Fenwick would carry the torch through the fictional setting of Albert Square, with live footage shown in the second episode on 23 July 2012. London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe said: \\"The announcement is a great addition to the Olympic Torch Relay Route. I'm sure the people of Walford will now start planning their celebrations. Along with people right round the UK, the residents of Albert Square will be getting involved to make this their moment to shine.\\" Fenwick said, \\"When we first discussed the storyline, my initial thought was that I'll now have to get fit. While this may be a fictional one-off for Billy, it's a real once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me and I am thrilled that Walford and Albert Square will be part of this amazing event.\\" He later added: \\"I think it's great that EastEnders has done this storyline, because it would be totally wrong and remiss not to acknowledge the biggest event in our lifetime, which technically—in fictional land—is five minutes up the road from Walford.\\" Roger Mosey, the BBC's director for London 2012, said, \\"I like this, in media terms, that it's the real torch, the real procession going to Walford. It will be live when it goes there and so potentially you can broadcast EastEnders for three or four minutes on the News Channel because the torch being in Albert Square is a news event. I like the idea of the real torch being in a fictional place.\\" On 15 July 2012, it was announced that a seven-minute live segment at the end of episode would show Billy taking part in the relay, followed by Lola giving birth to her daughter, while Billy rushes to be there. Harold would become only the second actress to act out a birth during a live episode of a soap opera, following Coronation Street's Jennie McAlpine (Fiz Stape) in the live 50th anniversary episode broadcast in December 2010. An insider from the show stated, \\"No one has tried anything like this on EastEnders live before so it is a real challenge to get the emotion of the situation right. It will be the toughest thing Danielle has done in her acting career.\\" Production Perry Fenwick (Billy Mitchell, pictured) said he was \\"worried\\" about carrying the Olympic Flame in the live section of the episode. Carl Doran, the creative head of the Torch coverage across the BBC, revealed in a blog on BBC Online, that the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) and EastEnders production team had worked for two years to organise the flame being shown live on EastEnders, saying \\"We've been looking into the practicalities and many challenges of getting the torch to Walford in time for an EastEnders slot while it makes a whistle-stop tour through London's 32 boroughs in the final week of the 70-day journey around the UK. We also discussed the idea of trying to record it on tape like a traditional EastEnders episode as well, but we always wanted it to be as authentic as possible and so it will be the real torch and flame and it will happen live. It's very exciting, and even more so because live broadcasting adds an extra set of challenges to a top drama.\\" Rehearsals for the live section of the episode started on 21 July 2012 and full dress rehearsals on 22 July, though there was some tentative rehearsal time before that when they were also busy filming other episodes. Fenwick said of his rehearsals, \\"Summer arrives just in time for me to complete my 24th circuit of Albert Square and I'm sweltering. On the plus side, I'm starting to see abs, have buns of steel and the show is looking good too!\\" He had to check the route for potholes beforehand, as well as making sure he knew his lines, and said he was looking forward to it being over. He was worried about carrying the torch during the live broadcast, as he may have dropped it or it could have gone out. He stated that he, as an actor, was feeling more nervous than his character. Harold said of the rehearsals, \\"I have known about this live episode for such a long time but all of a sudden it has crept up on us. I am really nervous but now we have started rehearsing, I am feeling equally excited. It will definitely be an experience and I hope Perry runs smoothly!\\" She also said she was \\"terrified\\" of acting out the birth, saying she would prefer to give birth in real life. She said that filming the pre-recorded labour scenes meant she \\"was knackered after screaming and crying and pretending to push all day.\\" In an interview with Digital Spy, she said that she was \\"really, really nervous\\" and that the prospect of acting the birth was \\"very scary\\", but added, \\"I really appreciate that they've given me the opportunity, especially considering that I haven't been here at EastEnders for that long. It's really nice that they've trusted me with it, so hopefully I'll do it justice! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll go well.\\" To help prepare, she asked several women for advice, including her mother, and was told \\"It's the worst pain you can ever imagine!\\" She found it \\"quite difficult\\" to imagine what it would be like to act out as she has no children, but had watched Channel 4 show One Born Every Minute to help, as she did not want to \\"overdo the scene or make it look really fake.\\" The episode was part of the official torch relay, and Fenwick ran with the real torch protection team dressed as an official torch bearer. The torch made a special detour from London to the EastEnders set in BBC Elstree, Borehamwood. Fenwick's route saw him carry the torch from the fictional location of Bridge Street, past The Queen Victoria public house and around Albert Square. The majority of the episode was filmed in advance, and the whole episode was directed by Clive Arnold, who said, \\"As the only drama asked to be involved with the Olympic Torch Relay, it is a huge honour for EastEnders and for everyone involved—a truly once in a lifetime opportunity. I was so excited and thrilled when I was asked to be part of the episode and I know that every member of cast and crew feel exactly the same way.\\" The live scenes used 19 cameras, along with the 31 regular cast members, plus 11 child cast members and at least 450 extras. As the programme switched from pre-recorded to live scenes, Fenwick, in character, winked at the camera and said \\"Here we go!\\" Part of the relay was shown on BBC News. \\"Billy's Olympic Nightmare\\" \\"Billy's Olympic Nightmare\\" is a one-off spin-off episode of EastEnders, broadcast via the BBC Red Button on 16 July 2012, to tie in with the episode where Billy is a torch bearer. This episode features Billy missing several promotional events. The episode stars comedian Omid Djalili as a cab driver named Hercules, plus athletes Kelly Holmes, Tessa Sanderson, Kriss Akabusi, Mark Foster, newsreader Sonali Shah, and television presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones as themselves. Perry said of the spin-off, \\"Filming this was like a dress rehearsal of my worst nightmare! It was strange filming at West Ham as again, like Billy, I feel it's my home. I'm over the moon to be carrying the torch through Walford, and working with the likes of Dame Kelly Holmes has made me even more excited to do so!\\" Fenwick revealed that Djalili improvised some of his lines. Billy is set to carry the Olympic Torch through Walford and has 30 minutes before he has to collect the torch. Billy takes a taxicab to the BBC be interviewed on The One Show but discovers that the other torchbearers have already been interviewed. He is chased out of the studio by a security guard. Billy's next stop is Wembley Stadium and again he discovers the torchbearers have already left. Billy then goes to West Ham United F.C. and catches up with the other torchbearers but unfortunately Billy has lost his pass and is not allowed in. His taxi driver, Hercules, appears with Billy's pass and he takes part in the celebrations. Billy then wakes up in the hair and beauty salon in Walford and it turns out he was dreaming. Reception =Pre-broadcast= Jane Rackham from the Radio Times called the episode \\"highly topical\\", while Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said: \\"With London hosting the Games, this is an appropriate and ambitious story for [East]Enders to tackle\\", and called both Fenwick and Harold \\"superb\\". Boyd Hilton from Heat said Billy carrying the Olympic torch was a \\"gimmick\\", and said the entire episode should have been live, whilst Heat Karen Edwards said Harold acting out a live birth would be \\"amazing\\", adding, \\"much respect goes out to Danielle who will be working hard to make the episode a success.\\" =Post-broadcast= Talking about Billy being stuck on the train, the Elstree & Borehamwood Times wrote: \\"Viewers sat biting their nails on tenterhooks, waiting to see if he would make it back to Walford in time.\\" Karen Edwards from Heat called the episode \\"quite the special night\\" and said that it was \\"Not an easy task\\" for Fenwick. She called his wink \\"cheeky\\" and \\"brilliant\\", saying it \\"just showed how real the whole thing was\\". She added that it was \\"emotional\\" to watch, and said that Harold \\"did the best fake birth screaming we've seen in a long while. [...] Pretty impressive work, we're sure you'll agree.\\" Matt Brito from Comedy Central UK said the fact that nothing went wrong in the live broadcast was \\"boring\\". Laura Morgan from All About Soap said the live segment was \\"seamless\\", saying it deserved a gold medal for \\"the best thing on TV last night\\". She said she loved Fenwick's wink to the camera and praised Harold, saying the birth finished off the live segment \\"perfectly\\", adding: \\"Hats off to relative newbie Danielle Harold (aka Lola) for making the birth scenes look so realistic on live TV... That's no mean feat!\\" She also said it was \\"the perfect way to kick off the 2012 Olympic Games\\". After the episode, five of the ten top trending topics on social networking site Twitter related to the live event. =Ratings= Overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 7.32 million people, a 31% share of the total viewing audience for that time, and the live section peaked at 7.9 million (32.6%). A repeat on BBC Three received overnight ratings of 1.04 million (6.1%). However, this was down on the first episode shown that day, which received 7.59 million viewers, and rival soap opera Coronation Street, whose two episodes broadcast on ITV that day received overnight ratings of 7.68 million and 7.8 million respectively. Official ratings from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board showed that the episode gained 8.11 million viewers. It was the fourth most- watched programme on BBC One that week and the fifth most-watched programme on UK television that week, beaten by the previous episode of EastEnders, the first episode of Coronation Street broadcast on that day, and the following Friday's broadcasts of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and opening ceremony countdown. The BBC Three repeat officially received 1.1 million viewers. =Award nominations= In February 2013, the episode was nominated for an All About Soap award for Best Episode, under the title \\"Billy and the Olympic Torch\\". In April 2013, the episode was nominated for \\"Spectacular Scene of the Year\\" at The British Soap Awards, for Billy carrying the torch.

Content The book's namesake comes from the scientific confusion over how ordinary matter makes up only four percent of the mass-energy in the universe, with the rest consisting of mysterious dark matter and dark energy that are both invisible and almost impossible to detect. It is due to dark matter that galaxies are able to keep their shape, with the mass of dark matter creating enough gravitational force to hold the stars that make up a galaxy together. Dark energy, however, is a substance or force responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe over time. The significant focus of The 4 Percent Universe is on the developments of astronomical science in the 20th century, including the formation of the expanding universe theory by Edwin Hubble in the 1930s. This model, when used in conjunction with Albert Einstein's general relativity helped in the creation of the Big Bang model and the later discovery of the cosmic background radiation in the 1960s. In following this history, Panek also discusses the flaws and missing pieces in the theories and the quest by two major scientific groups to discover the reason for the expansion of the universe not matching the models as expected. The book discusses the science behind the idea of dark matter being made up of weakly interacting massive particles and how scientists tried to determine the existence of dark energy from the 1990s and onward. The two groups involved in this research were the Supernova Cosmology Project headed by Saul Perlmutter and the High-Z Supernova Search Team headed by Brian Schmidt, both of which were involved in pioneering the use of Type Ia supernovae as standard candles for determining the variation in the universe's rate of expansion over its history, which in turn allows prediction of its future expansion. Style Salon's Laura Miller described Panek and his writing style as a \\"wondrously clear explicator of some thorny concepts\\". Writing a review for Science News magazine, Ron Cowen commented that Panek \\"writes eloquently about the mind- bending search for meaning in a universe dominated by stuff no one can see\\", while he also \\"weaves together concepts from particle physics, relativity, quantum mechanics and cosmology with personal portraits of astronomers\\". Critical reception Kirkus Reviews described the book as having \\"vivid sketches of scientists, lucid explanations of their work and revealing descriptions of the often stormy rivalry that led to this scientific revolution, usually a media cliché, but not in this case.\\" Choice magazine reviewer C. G. Wood rated the work as \\"highly recommended\\" and noted that while Panek \\"does not shortchange the science\\", the book mainly \\"concentrates on the personalities of those involved in the highly personal and sometimes bitter rivalry\\". The convoluted nature and number of scientists, organizations, and events involved in the book's topic is pointed out by Carl Zimmer in writing for The Washington Post, who stated that \\"Panek's passion for the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy wins the day\\" and that the premise \\"succeeds because he recognizes that he's writing not just about red shifts and supernovae, but about people\\". In a special for The Dallas Morning News, author Fred Bortz commended how Panek takes the complicated scientific nature of the book's topic and \\"weaves that science into a compelling narrative of a quest full of technological challenges, unexpected turns and expected human rivalries over high stakes, including perhaps a future Nobel Prize.\\" Samantha Nelson for The A.V. Club rated the book a C-, lamenting how Panek is able to describe scientific material in an understandable manner, but that the science is \\"bogged down by Panek's focus on the teams researching cosmology\\", finally noting that the \\"people behind the scientific discoveries deserve credit, but the science should still be the star of the book.\\" See also *Dark matter in fiction *Exotic matter *Mirror matter *Negative mass *Quintessence (physics) *Scalar field dark matter *Self-interacting dark matter *Unparticle physics *Quintessence: The Search for Missing Mass in the Universe References Further reading 2011 non-fiction books Physics books Cosmology books Astronomy books Houghton Mifflin books ","title":"The 4 Percent Universe"},{"id":"36605081","title":"List of SpongeBob SquarePants guest stars"},{"id":"36605100","text":"John Hamilton Bowie (born 16 July 1938) is an Australian scientist and academic,Kevin M.Downard, \\"John Hamilton Bowie\\", The Encyclopedia of Mass Spectrometry, Historical Perspectives: Notable People in Mass Spectrometry, 2015, 9B, pp 25-26 best known for his contributions to research in the fields of the chemistry of negative ions in the gas phase and of bio-active peptides in skin glands.

Turner was four times British gymnastics champion.Turner's biography on the 'Sports Reference – Olympic Sports' website Born in the East End of London in 1922, Turner developed an interest in sports as a boy, training in table tennis, diving, football, boxing and gymnastics. As a flyweight Turner boxed in the semi-finals of the Amateur Boxing Association of England Championship before deciding to develop his interest in gymnastics. Aged 11 he won the South of England Boys Championship in 1933 before making his international debut aged 15 in 1938. On leaving school in 1939 he worked as a bank clerk, but during World War II he was conscripted into the Royal Artillery in 1941. He served in North Africa and Sicily and was twice wounded.

It was erected in 1843 on the site of Haus Mickeln, which went back to 1210. As that building had been destroyed in a fire in 1836, Herzog Ludwig von Arenberg used an insurance payment to have renowned architect Josef Niehaus rebuild the manor as a summer residence. Niehaus used engravings of villas built in the 16th century by Galeazzo Alessi as a template. The manor has a square plan, each side measuring 19.55 metres. All perspectives are designed identically, apart from an outside staircase on the northern side. The entrance portal is surrounded by lime trees. That concept was already envisaged in 1843, when the surrounding gardens were designed by Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe. Some of the trees, e.g. plane trees, European Beech, and two Lebanon cedars, have survived; the last-named are considered one of Düsseldorf's natural monuments. Since June 2000, the estate has been used as a conference centre and guest house by Düsseldorf University.  Literature  * Ludger Fischer: Die schönsten Schlösser und Burgen am Niederrhein.
